continuation of statement of Stephen Bradshaw

clarify if she paid out the amount indicated on the horizon screen or the amount of the voucher.

Mrs Brennan stated that she prepared her pension and allowance vouchers every day for checking if it

was not busy. She would check that the number of vouchers tallied with the horizon print off. She also

Knew that if a genuine mistake had been made and the correct amount of money had been paid to the

Customer and the wrong amount entered onto the horizon system, her balance would show a surplus

Of cash. She also said that her balance record was OK and that she had now been allocated B stock,

and would keep this stock until the Branch Manager changed them. Mrs Brennan confirmed that her

Balance was only a “couple of quid out” for w/e 12 June 2002. She was then asked to check the group

5 pension and allowances declared on 6 June 2002. She then said that the one for £26.60 was not

Right and had been declared as £226.30 and agreed that it belonged to B stock. I now produce the

Horizon pension and allowance print out as exhibit SB/3 and the transaction log as exhibit SB/4. Ms

Brennan was then asked to check the group 5 pension and allowances for 23 May 2002. She

Confirmed that the amount of £115.75 was a wrong amount. I now produce the horizon print and

Transaction Log for this date as exhibits SB/5 and SB/6. She was shown a transaction log for 23 May

2002, this showed that the claimant also received a Gp14 payment of £109.45 with the child benefit.

The mistake only occurred in the Gp 5 payment, although two trans actions had been performed. I now

Produce this log as exhibit SB/7. Mrs Brennan was shown further transaction logs which showed that a

group 7 voucher, value of £250.60 had been paid out but could not be found in the vouchers submitted

I now produce these logs as exhibits SB/8 and SB/9. Mrs Brennan gave no reasonable explanation for

for the discrepancies, which had occurred on a regular basis. The findings from the paid order unit, for

weeks 41 and 42 were read out from the 205a to Mrs Brennan. Again no explanation could be given

given for these discrepancies. I now produce the tapes of the interview with Mrs Brennan as exhibits
