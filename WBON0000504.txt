Subject: Questions on the KEL [BD- 4A. F1D26610170]

Dear Pete,

I hope you are well.

You may recall you have kindly helped me out in the past with some queries on the Known Error Log.

Would you be able to assist please with a few quick follow up questions?

Is it more accurate to call the KEL a database rather than a document? Yes it is a database which changes with new
KELs being added, changed, and removed on a regular basis.

Is it right to say that the KEL exists as one single database/document rather than multiple different logs? It is one

database.

I understand the KEL runs to thousands of entries. Is it possible to say how many pages the KEL would run to? Stats

below.

The KEL DB Knowledge Overview lists the following i.e. 3973 KEL’s
