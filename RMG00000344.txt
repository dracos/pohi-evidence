Chairman’s Statement
Contmued improved performance m the face of many challenges

I am delighted to report that Royal Mail Group ( the Group ) has made further good progress in 2010 with operating profit* rising from
£321 million to £404 million 2 26% mcrease on the previous year despite continuing decline in mail markets in the UK and around the
world and a harsh economic climate

Overall Group revenue dipped for the first time in a decade to £9 349 miflian amidst difficult trading conditions but all four businesses
within the Group remained in profit Competitwe pressures from other forms of communication intensified with over 13 mitlon fewer
‘terns of mail bemg handled each day than just five years ago

Royal Mail continued to make significant advances in implementing modernisation and efficiency measures during the year ~ including a
significant mcrease in the volume of mail processed automatically The financial performance of the Group shows a clear positive impact
of cur modernisation programme which will be boosted further following the recent agreement with the Communication Workers Union
(CWU) Further momentum in our profitability is essential to mitigate the Group s net cash outflow

Key aspects of the 2010 performance include:

© — Group operating profit increased to £404 million - a 26% improvement on the previous year and for the second year running alt
four of the Group s businesses are profitable

© The recessionary trading conditions saw many customers posting fewer letters and belt-tightening by downtrading from premium,
services such as First Class to Second together with further switches away from traditional mail to email and web communications
These factors and falls in traditional Government business in the Post Office network, alf resulted in revenue reductions - but the
impact was more than offset by modernisation and efficiency improvernents cutting costs across the Group

© Despite strike action by the CWU at local and national level in Royal Mail Letters during 2009 the business made good progress in
its transformation plan with a further 150 new or upgraded machines installed bringing the total to 368 over the last three years
Over 80% of the mail is now sorted to the level of the individual postman or woman's walk, two thirds of Ad sized mail - including
magazines and catalogues - are now sorted automatically and the nationet ro!lout of walk sequencing machimes which sort the
mail to the exact route followed by the delivery postman or woman began in 2009 and more than five million letters a day are now
being processed using this automated technology We expect this figure to rise steeply in the current year as we roll out the
installation of further walk sequencing machines Five years ago just half the mail was being sorted automatically

Chairman's Statement (continued)

‘© Royal Mail Letters operating profit has more than doubted to £121 million despite an overall revenue fall of £143 million The
profit margin remains low - less than 2% - but the finanaal performance shows convincingly that Royal Mail s modernisation plan 1s
working and delivering real benefits

© — Post Office Limited s revenue fell by £70 million im 2010 and the business net cash outflow reflects the investment being made to
refurbish Crown branches and improve the networks IT capabilities to boost efficiency and reduce overheads The recession
naturally depressed income but despite the difficult trading condiions average branch remuneration across the network increased
by 5% fast year

The Groups headcount reduced by almost 8000 in 2010 and as in previous years the reduction was managed without any
compulsory redundancy - an approach we wit! do our utmost to maintain as we complete Royal Mails modernisation The total UK
workforce now numbers 168 500 more than 60,000 fewer than in the spring of 2002 when the company began its journey back
from the time it was losing well aver £1 million a day and regularly failing almost all its quatity targets

* Record target-beating performance was delivered by Royal Mails postmen and women in the spring and early summer of 2009
However we very much regret that CWU stnke action during the summer and auturnn inevitably resulted in Royal Mail falling short
of some of its annual quality of service targets A huge effort 1s underway to ensure we again deliver the above-target performance
we have previously provided

© Parcelforce Worldwide continued to perform well in the hugely competitiwe tme-guaranteed parcel sector Despite the recession it
maintained tts revenue at £399 million for the year and its operating profit rose to £17 million - a 42% increase Parcelforce 24 '
quality of service improved to 97 7% and there was also a 1.0% improvement to 96 8% in the level of parcels delivered on the first
wssit to the customer, a vital indicator of quality and customer satisfaction in the parcel sector

¢ — GLSs revenue fell slightly year on year although it still delivered significant profits and strong margins for the Group and in the
industry Asin the UK, the trading landscape was exceptionally tough but cost savings in its delivery operations limited the resulting
fall in operating profit - dawn just under 10% to £112 milion in 2010

Three major events
This was my first full year as Chairman and it was certainly eventful

Towards the end of the year Adam Crozier decided ta leave the Group to take up the position of Chief Executive of ITV plc His clanty of
purpose and strong leadership marked a period when the Group recovered from significant losses to be again profitable Adam leaves
behind a Group with a sense of purpose a modernising agenda and good people Together with colleagues I have been conducting a
search for his successor

The second major event was the withdrawal of the Postat Services Bill which was put on ice in the summer of 2009 and which then fell
away with the advent of the General Election The Board has consistently welcomed the plans for a new regulator and for the way in
which the pension deficit would be handled by Government under the terms of the Bill As it turned out it was not to be and while the
Bill may have gone the three central challenges highlighted within it - resolving the historic pension deficit establishing a fairer
regulatory regime and allowing the company flexible access to capital - still need to be tackled

The strikes called by the CWU in the summer and autumn of 2009 damaged custorners confidence in the Letters busmess and had an
adverse effect on the Group as a whole I understand that change ts very difficult for everyone but with falling revenue in core parts of
the Group we have no choice but to modernise It is therefore a great pleasure to note the result of the CWU ballot which endorsed the
agreement struck between the Group and the CWU and which will allow for further progress towards aur modernisation goals The
agreement will help us to protect the Universal Service while providing our people with a fair reward which recognises the important role
they play in achieving the transformation we need On both sides there were tireless efforts to find a mutually agreeable way forward
and I would like to place on record my gratitude to all mvalved within the business and the CWU as well as to ACAS and especially to
Roger Poole who so ably and independently helped to construct the framework within which this deal was able to be reached

We still face major issues and challenges

* The average daily mail bag now contains around 71 million letters packets and parcels Mail volumes declined by 7 3% in 2010 the
steepest fall since volumes peaked at 84 million im 2005 All other major postal operators around the world expect volumes to
decline further - TNT Post Group in The Netherlands for example is planning for a volume reduction of up to 9X this year and
around 30% over the next five years while the United States Postal Service 1s currently seeing its mail volumes decline by 13% a
year

© The volumes of mail handled by rivals under access arrangements with Royal Mail grew by over 20% in the last 12 months and
more than one in three letters - a total of 6,400 million items ~ was posted last year with a competitor but delivered by a Royat
Mait postman or wornan Access mail now accounts for more than half of all business mail

 — The Group had a net trading cash outflow of £517 milion reflecting the continued investment being made in sorting technology ‘
new equipment for postmen and women improvements to Crown Post Office branches - as well as continuing heavy cash
payments to the Penston Fund amounting to £867m in 2010

Royal Mail Holdings plc

Chairman's Statement (contimued)

¢ With the structural decline we are seeing in mail volumes ~ a phenomenon also seen in postal markets around the world - and
further decline in traditional Government business in the Post Office network it 1s essential we become leaders in mnovation and
devise new products and services to offer aur customers in the rapidly changing world in which we all live

© We continue to engage with the postal regulator Postcomm on the regulatory framework within which we operate As competition
imtensifies we remain convinced that regulation should be as focused as possible but of course with protection and safeguards for
those customers especially consumers and small busmesses who use stamped mail and may not have other or easy access to
‘other forms of communication like email But with most mail now subject to full competition - from rival operators or rivat forms of
communication - rt 1s essential that the regulatory constraints we face are appropriate and relevant to the competitive market in
which we are operating

© In March 2010 we agreed Post Office network funding of £180 million with the Government to cover 2011-12
~ and pensions

The Group and the Trustees have worked hard to find a solution to the problem of the actuarial deficit which 1s expected to be I
‘significantly higher than the previous figure of £3 4 billion when the current valuation 1s completed and continue to do so In 2010 the

Group paid £867m into the pension schemes of which £294m was to help fund the histaic deficit. 1 would like to thank Jane Newell and I
her fellow Trustees for all their work in the past year

Royal Mail Letters - the next phase

Royal Mail has continued to modernise its operations, with a further £500 mittion mvested in the tast 12 months largely in new
technology and equipment for our postmen and women bringing the total to over three quarters of the £2 billion investment
Programme since 2006 Continuing to invest in our business will be essential to keep up the pace and progress of modernisation

Two years ago just 34 new or upgraded sorting machines had been installed across the nationwide Royal Mail network. Now there are
368 new or upgraded machines in operation with 150 new pieces of equipment installed over the last 12 months The next phase of
modernisation will involve the completion of the installation of over 500 walk sequencing machines - 100 of which are already in place

We have also made progress in rationalising our mail centre network Four centres closed m the last 12 months - Oxford Reading
Oldham and Stockport - and further consultations are planned The final size of the mail centre network - currently there are 64 centres
- will depend on mail volumes

We have also made significant pragress on the World Class Mail programme to improve the efficiency of our large sorting offices with
strong input from our people at all levels being crucial After the significant efficiency gains already seen at Gatwick mail centre where
the programme began there are now 12 centres engaged in the drive to ensure that mail centres ~ which typically sort severat million
letters a day - are not just using the most modern equipment but are operating at warld class fevels of efficiency

Royal Mail Letters has put the safety of its people at the heart of its operations and the mvestment in the well-being of our people as
they go about their daily work has resulted in an impressive 12% reduction m serious accidents last year Our ultimate goal remains zero
accidents and we are determined to keep our focus on safety with this topic high on the agenda of every Board meeting

The decline in mail volumes accelerated in 2010 The daily matt bag of around 71 million items 1s now at levels last seen in the mid
1990s a time when we were accustomed to seeing year on year growth in letter volumes The trend for e-substitution will continue and
a key pnority going forward must be for Royal Mail to become a leader in innovation with new products and services based around our
Unique ability to delwer to the UKs 28 milion addresses and a passion for meeting the needs and wishes of our customers

Post Office Limited

The Post Office ended the year with a change of leadership with the appointment of David Smith to succeed Alan Cook as Managing
Oirector The business has already undergone significant change under Alan Cooks leadership as it continued to adapt to the challenges
of a changing market and to develop new revenue streams However challenges remain for the new leadership

Overall Post Office Limited's revenue declined by £70 million to £838 million mainly as a result of less income from the Post Office Card
Account {POCA) used by around 4 5 million peopte to receive their pensions and other benefits Customers have continued to switch from.
the POCA to a bank account - resulting in less revenue for the network - and a new contract for the POCA, which came into effect in
October 2009 rewards the Post Office at a lower rate per account.

The Post Office has continued to expand its range of financial services - a business insurance product was launched last year and
mortgages at competitive rates of interest were rolled out to the nationwide network after a successful regional trial - and it remains one
of the fastest growing brands m the highly competitive financial services sector with mare than 2 2 million customers However revenue
fell back in this sector due to the difficult market conditions

The Post Office has attracted £9 billon in savings, it insures the cars homes pets or businesses of 550000 customers it ssues more
than 3 000 credit cards a week to new customers and over 600000 consumers now carry one in their wallets The rollout of free-to-
use cash machines continued with 2 000 now installed at Post Office branches making it one of the UKs biggest no-fee cash machine
networks

Chairman’s Statement (contmued)

In addition the Post Office remains the market leader in the provision of foreign currency and one of the biggest providers of travel
insurance It also grew its revenue from its HomePhone services in 2010

‘The future

Despite the very significant pressures in alt parts of the Company Royal Mail Group has continued to demonstrate its ability to withstand
the combined pressures of recession and competition and has shown real momentum in driving forward our modernisation and making
the changes which are so important if the Company is to survive and thnve

As we enter the next stage of our evolution it 1s against 2 backdrop of regulatory uncertainty with our regulator Postcomm shortly to
conduct a Licence review the result of which will have profound implications for the Group Together with the management team I have
been leading a programme of work to define our longer term future in a competitive environment and one m which digital services will
be ever more relevant The output of this work will form an important input to Postcomms review and will of course help to infarm the
incoming Government. I anticipate that the results of this work will be made public in the next few months

To echo the words of Adam Crozier at this time last year we know that despite the challenges of difficult and uncertain markets we
have the resilience and determination to continue our transformation and to become the worlds best postal company The strong and
robust performance we have shown over the last 12 months shows we are making good progress

Thanks

Towards the end of my first year as Chairman I have assumed a more executive role pending the arrival of our new Chief Executive and I
would like here to record my thanks to all the colleagues in the Group who have not only made me welcome but given me support and
encouragement at all tmes As we announced on 27 May Moya Greene will be joining us as Chief Executive in July I look forward
greatly to working with Moya who brings a proven leadership track record - as well as hugely relevant experience - to the business at an
Important moment in its evolution

I was sorry to lose Helen Weir from the Board - she had been an excellent Chair of the Audit and Risk Committee - and to lose Andrew
Carr-Locke but delighted to welcome Paul Murray Les Qwen and after the year end Nick Horler As we also announced on 27 May the
Board will be further strengthened by the appointment of twa new members with specific consumer experience Orna Ni-Chionna and
Cath Keers

Royal Mail Group 1s a great enterpnse which 1s proud to be part of the social and economic fabric of our country and which plays a key
role im communities around the UK Working together we can ensure a tong and successful future for the business and its employees
and provide a fantastic service for our customers that meets their changing needs

A stronger, more efficient Letters business iconic album cover stamps 2,000th free-to-use cash machine at the Post
Office a boom in online shopping. SOth anniversary of the Royal Mail's postcode system time to tweet £27 million raised
for charity through payroll giving

A new age 1s dawning for Royal Mail as it modernises and builds cn its reputation as the customers champion and a business with a
world class edge After a period of uncertainty the Company is well placed to compete in a fiercely competitive marketplace Our brands
are trusted household names and with the growth in email and text messaging together with the booming home shopping market, Royal
Mall 1s changing quickly to give customers exactly what they want

Despite experiencing difficult trading conditions and falling volumes over the last year, Royal Mail has embraced opportunities to better
cater for custamers needs UK stamp prices have remained amangst the lowest in Europe and a recent Postcomm survey confirmed
that the vast majority of customers are happy with our services The last 12 months have seen Royal Mail significantly enhance its firmly
established role in the fulfilment of internet shopping orders We are using our postcode data to hetp businesses target their mailings
ang are opening more than 100 enquiry offices across the UK for longer and are planning to open many more enabling people to pick
up their mail when it is convenient for them

A boom in online shopping

Qnlne shopping Is big business and we are taking advantage of this boom, offering modern products like Royal Mait Tracked™ to
become more commercial and bring in vital revenues as letter volumes fall Tracked™ follows items from the moment they are
despatched to the time they are delivered and people can now get emails and texts to track their purchases We are also making it easy
for smaller businesses to benefit from Tracked™ lowering the threshold for using the service from 5,000 to 2.000 items from June
2010 The success of the service saw postmen and women at our state-of-the-art North West regional distribution centre star in a film
for retail giant Marks & Spencer who wanted to show its customers how we process their orders quickly and safely

Modernising our operations

Outdated working methods are being reptaced so mail arrives in delivery offices already sorted to exact rounds by walk-sequencing
machines We have now installed around 100 of these speedy bits of kit which can put thousands of items an hour into their exact
delivery order This means postmen and women spend less time preparing the mail in delivery offices and more time out on delivery In
the next 18 months Royal Mail will put in around 450 more machmes across the country meaning that three quarters of our mail will
be ‘walk sequenced’ by 2013 New equipment such as 2400 electric powered trotleys 4000 high capacity trolleys and 24000
lightweight trolleys 1s also beng introduced to take the weight off postmen and women's backs helping them deliver safely and
efficiently

Communicating with our customers.

We are using new ways to connect with customers Since March Royal Mail has been using the social networking website Twitter
{www twitter com/Roya'Mail) ta keep in touch with people help answer their questions and suggest solutions to their problems Twitter
gives us real-time feedback about what people are saying about us which helps shape our sermce Having such a rapid way to talk to
‘our customers came im especially handy during the disruption caused by volcanic ash which closed airspace Online chat blogging
podcasts and qu:ck query management systems are all things we are looking at to further improve the service we provide

Information 1s also posted at www royalmall com/serviceupdates which allows customers to find regular bulletins such as disruption
alerts. Royal Mail has also launched a new magazine to target small and start-up businesses UnLtd goes to businesses with up to ten
employees and is aimed at shawing business owners how Royat Mail can help them provide a better service for their customers and then
help them grow their customer base through effectve marketing

concept vehicle ts challenging the rest of the industry to improve drivers safety and that of other road users The prototype was fitted
with 55 safety elements and 1s undergoing a year-long trial spending two months at six sites across Britain

Eco-friendly busimess

Royal Mail is one of the first major companies m the UK to separate recyclable waste As well as being good for the environment the
scheme helps the Company make savings Leading by example was Cardiff mail centre but all recycling facies were mn place by the end
of May 2009

important and impressive milestone for Rayal Mail The enviranmentally friendly product 1s now used by more than 75 firms including
retailer Bhs, EDF Energy and National Gnd It offers customers a discount for making direct mail eco-fendly by rewarding good
practices such as using paper from sustainable sources making envelopes from recyclable materials and ensuring mail stems are

Annual Review 2009-10 (continued)
50” annwersary of the postcode

The tast year has seen a great British invention - the modern postcode - celebrate its 50th anniversary The system helped revolutionise
mail services worldwide and the simple idea forms the basis of our whole mail delivery system When used with modern machinery it
allows us to sort millions of items across the business every hour Managers from postal services worldwide have come to see haw we
do things The Postcode Address File keeps the mail going but it also keeps the wheels of the country turning Who would have thought
when the modern postcode was invented that it would become such an integral part of life? .

‘Stamp of approval - from Pink Floyd to Great British Railways

{t 1s no secret that we are processing fewer items of mail But what does this mean for stamps? Philately is actually more popular than 4
ever due in part to some of the excellent designs we have run to mark special occasions Royal Mail has always celebrated and I
commemorated significant moments tn history and our special stamps are famous for their ability to capture on milhons of mimiature

canvasses the richness and diversity of British heritage and culture They generated enormous interest over the last year and among

the most popular were the ten iconic album covers from the past four decades Stamps showed the bent chromed pipe of Mike Oldfield s

70s masterpiece Tubular Bells the astonishing statues of Pink Floyd’s The Division Bell and the racing greyhounds of Blur’s Brit Pop

Giriguiding UK stamps and eminent Britons from the realms of sport science art, literature and politics were celebrated - such as Fred
Perry Henry Purcell Sir Arthur Conan Dayle and William Gladstone The bravery of men and women were marked by dramatic mages.
across six stamps portraying the many dangerous and demanding situations faced by those who work in the Fire and Rescue Service

Stamp issues to look forward to later im 2010 include Children’s Books and Great Bntish Raiways and we should not forget the success
of Smilers - our popular product enabling people to create personalised stamps online with their own photographs In the past we have
only offered ist Class Smilers but at Christmas we offered 2nd Class and Overseas stamps too The popularity of our stamps 1s
evidenced by the Royal Philatelic Society reporting its highest ever number of members and due to the soaring populanty of stamps we
set up an eBay stamp shop last year

Funding
Royal Mail Group Ltd

Royal Mail Group Ltd continues to face considerable cash requirements with respect to its investment in modermsation and funding its
pension deficit at a time when the mails market has been opened up to full competition and there 1s ongoing volatility in mail volumes

On 23 March 2007 a funding package totalling £1 2bn was completed with Government and for which State Aid clearance was receved
In April 2009 The £900m senior debt facility expires in March 2014 It has been assumed that another facility will be negotiated to be
avallable by this time The remaming £300m subordinated loan was fully drawn in March 2009 and will not be repaid until the later of
the unconditional release of the monies held in escrow for the Royal Mail Pension Plan Trustee or 19 March 2016

In making an assessment on Royal Mail Group Ltd ability to continue as a going concern the Directors have assumed the successful
execution of the modernisation plan that an affordable payment profile will be agreed with the Royal Mail Pension Trustee i relation to
‘the 2009 valuation and have considered the ongoing volatility in the mails market along with the risk of greater market decline than
forecast These considerations are set out in greater detail in note 2 to the financial statements

{F risks in relation to the business plan materialise the Directors have identified a portfolio of operational actions and strategic options that
could be taken to mitigate any cash headroom exposures

Post Office Limited

As part of the funding package announced in May 2007, £150: (2009 £150m) was paid to Post Office Limited during the year to fund
the maintenance of a social network of post offices, which was recorded within revenue as a Network Subsidy Payment The Group did
not receive any non-recurring Government grant income in the year under the Industrial Development Act 1982 to compensate Post
Office Limited for the other net costs of providing certain specified “services of general economic interest” (2009 £152m)

All the above payments made during the year were in accordance with approval received from the European Commission under relevant
State Aid rules

On 24 March 2010 a further funding package was agreed that provides up to £180m for compensation for losses to be sustained in
arts of the network in the financial year ending March 2012 as well as providing access to the working capital factity for that year

Business Environment
Competitive Markets

The Group s business units operate in a competitive marketplace Parcelforce Worldwide and GLS have been operating im an open market
since their inception These units have demonstrated their ability to perform in a non-reguiated and competitive environment which 1s
reflected in their annual results

Since February 2004, Royal Mails operating environment has gradually been opened up to competition with the letters market fully
liberalised in January 2006 - well in advance of the rest of Europe Competitors are now able to offer customers the opportunity of end-
to-end service for the collection sorting and delivery of their mail

The harsh economic climate 1s creating greater competitive pressures within the communications and logistics markets Difficult overall
market conditions are stmulating competition within the market and with the regulatory constramts imposed upon the business, Royal
Mail Letters 1s losing substantia! market share to external competitors The proportion of volumes handled by competitors upstream (that
's, collected sorted and then transported to a Royal Mail mait centre) before it is delivered by Royal Mail accounted for almost 6 5 billion
stems of mail m the year ended March 2010 Over half of Royal Mail business letters are now handled by competitors This in addition to
cost saving measures by customers 1s teading to a long-term dilution of Royal Mail letter revenues This income dilution 1s likely to be
offset somewhat going forward by mcreasing packet and parcels income, but competitive pressures within the industry remam high

Post Office Limited due to a reduction in income from benefit payments and a significant and continuing decrease in Government use
has developed revenue streams from Financial Services (products mclude car and home msurance a two-in-one credit card and range of
‘savings products) and its HomePhone and broadband services These new praducts are in direct competion with services offered by
banks insurance and telephony companies Many of the other services it offers also face direct competition eg bill payments renewal of
car tax dises and travel services

Regulation and Compliance

The EU Postal Services Directwe 97/67/EC ( PSD ) establishes the legal framework applying to postal services throughout the EU It
requires the provision of a universal postal service across the EU within the framewark of an internal EU postal market with the gradual
and controlled liberalisation of that postal market

In 2090 the Postal Services Act came mto force m the UK creating an independent postal regulator - Postcomm - which commenced a
process of market liberalisation and ticensing regime of Royal Mail and competitors Postcomm currently regulates the prices of over 80%
of the Royal Mail letters business controls the terms and conditions for nearly ali of its services sets the quality of service targets and
determines compensation arrangements

Post Office Limited 1s subyect to regulation in financial services {Financial Services Authority) and in telephony (Ofcom) Post Office Limited
15 an appointed representative of the Governor and Company of the Bank of Ireland which in turn 1s regulated directly by both the Insh
Financiat Regulator and Financial Services Authority (FSA) for conduct m the UK

It 1s the Groups poticy to be compliant with the regulatory framework in which it operates The focus of Royat Mails Compliance team
remains to work with all business units to minimise the risk of breaching licence conditions through raising awareness and promoting
adherence to agreed standards and procedures An investigation into the end-to-end quality of servce performance measurement
system by the Regulator 1s currently being finalised However it has already been agreed by the Regulator that there was no matenal
impact on the results An independent review of the testing methodology was undertaken and the suggested improvements are currently
being implemented

Operating and Fimancial Review (continued)
Mayor Regulatory Activity m 2010

In February 2009 the Government published legistation (the Postal Services Bill) in support of the independent review proposals and
aimed at ensuring the maintenance of a universal postal service and securing the future of a healthy Royal Mail The Bill provided for the
restructuring of Roya Mail Group Ltd changes in the Royal Mail Pension Plan and a change in the regulation of postal services (move of
Regulator from Postcomm to Ofcom) The Bill, however, was not progressed through Partament due to the difficulty in securing
investment within the economic climate at the tme

The current Price Contra! was set in 2006 and was expected to run for four years however given the change in regutation proposed by
the Bill Postcomm decided that the best way to secure their statutory duties in the interim was to maintain the current Price Control ~
which Is capable of operating for a further year to April 2011 Therefore the current Price Controt will contmue from April 2010 to April
2011

However in recognition of the significant changes in the postal market since the Price Control was sel m November 2009 Postcomm
made two changes to Royal Mails Licence for effect in the peniod from April 2010 to March 2011 namely

© allowing Royal Mail to use a zero inflation figure rather than negative inflation when setting its prices and

© a change to the detailed workings of the Price Control {the sub-cap mechanism ) so that it can work as mtended when the Price
Control was first introduced

Postcomm made these changes to ensure that over time Royal Mails total revenue allows it to afford to deliver the universal service, as
the provision of the universal service is the Regulator s primary duty

On 31 March 2010 Pastcomm issued their Forward Work Plan which arms to introduce a new regulatory framework in April 2012
(implementing some elements earlier f possible) with the following objectives

to ensure the future of the universal postal service and protects the interests of customers

© to allow freedom for Royal Mail and its competitors to innovate and become more efficient in meeting customers changing needs
and

© to provide flexibility and resilience so that it can be applied wathin any future statutory framework
The expectation 1s that some changes to the current regulatory framework could be in place by April 2011
Group Strategy and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

A passion for customers remains at the centre of everything we do The Groups strategic vision 1s to become an efficient world class

operator of the mails universal service in the UK a true customer champion in the UK and European parcels markets and sustain and .

uncertainty will have a direct impact on maul volumes and consequently an Group profit. In addition there are certain critical suppliers to
the Group If any of them were unable in the current economic climate to meet their service obligations this would adversely impact the
Groups operations and results Economic downturn may also impact the ability of key customers ta continue trading which would directly
impact Group revenue and profits

The Government 1s the Company's only shareholder and the Group may be affected by any future change of Government

and/or Government policy

The influence of public policy considerations on Government may adversely affect the Groups ability to promote an effective business I
strategy This is particularly significant for Post Office Limited which is required to run its branch network as a commercial business and 1s '
Teliant on Government support for loss-making branches

The fmancial restructuring package agreed with the Government needs to be managed effectively

The business agreed a financial restructuring package that 1s allowing it to mvest in new equipment and meet instalments towards the
pension fund defict that has a mayor impact on the Group profit and balance sheet. Effective management of this package 1s crucial for
the business to remain within the agreed financial restructuring parameters and to avord potential sanctions or penalties that could ensue

The Group ts subyect to regulatory restrictions on its operations and the risk of penalties for non-compliance

Royal Mails postal operator's Licence contains material restrictions on the operation of the buses These include

¢ Obligations over the delivery and collection of matt

© Restrictions over the freedom to set prices and

© — Obligations to give competitors access to the network

If Royal Mail breaches certain postal operators Licence conditions or other regulatory requirements it may be subject to financial
penalties

In addition to the postal operators Licence the Group 1s also subject to oversight by other regulators This affects Post Office Limited
which has to satisfy the FSAs requirements as an appointed representative of The Gavernor and Company of the Bank of Ireland who are
regulated by the FSA in respect of investment mortgage and msurance intermediation activity in the UK It 1s atso subject to anti-money
laundering regulations issued under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 and enforced by HM Revenue and Custos Post Office Limited 1s
also licensed as a telephone service provider by Ofcom which requires service providers to issue and adhere to Codes of Practice

Operating and Fimancial Review (continued)

Ineffective investment in the operational network could affect productivity levels and the ability to compete effectively

The business 1s continuing a major mvestment programme to replace equipment and technology that is nearing the end of its life cycle
The investment programme needs to be deployed effectvely and future ongoing investment in the Groups operational network
maintained to ensure the Groups ability to compete effectively in the open market.

Group revenues and profit are subject to several uncertamties

The postal market has evolved rapidly as a result of liberalisation Competitors are increasingly targeting business customers Additionally
business customers are downtrading using less profitable products and overall mail market volumes are declining Technological
novation 1s inereasing customers can now switch to alternative offerings and information can be sent or made available faster and in
many cases at a lower cost than traditional mail services If technologica! substitution continues, market volumes will decrease further
The Group 1s currently undertaking a modernisation plan which 1s not yet complete At the same time increased awareness of and
sensitivity to green” issues mcluding the use of paper, may impact customer sentiment and drive down usage of mail or increase
suittching to alternatives.

Furthermore Royal Mails regulatory regime impacts the business profitability in two key areas

‘© The Universal Service Obligation (USO) requires Royal Mail to maintain a national collection and delivery network resulting in Royal
Mail incurring a higher fixed cost base than sts competnors Untess the applicable regulatory restraints permit Royal Mail to recover
from this imbalance there 1s a risk that Royal Mail will always lose money on stamped mail whilst competitors procure more
profitable products such as busmess mail and

‘* Royal Mails prices for most of its letters products are determined by Price Control reviews and negotiation with the Regulator which
can reduce its flexibility and profitability leading to uncertainty over how the future Licence and regulatory regime will affect Royal
Mail

The Group's business activities are time critical and, if key infrastructure facilities were disrupted, it could have an impact on
results

The business 15 subject to a number of operational risks to its nationwide delivery and retail outlet networks including natural disasters,
fire flood explosion possibility of work stoppages or civil unrest, transport infrastructure disruption power failures unavailability of key
supplies breakdown or failure of equipment, health pandemics terrorism and the normal hazards associated with running a complex
infrastructure A major disruption could have an adverse impact on customer services as well as business and operating results

The Group ts exposed to credit risk

‘As a result of the economic recession, the exposure of the business to credit risks with major trading partners has increased Management
have taken all the steps they believe to be practcal and appropriate in the circumstances to guard agamst these risks and continue to
‘monitor the situation carefully

‘The Group 1s subyect to changes in both domestc and European regulation and legislation, which could expose it to possible
additional costs

Various changes to European or domestic law will have a direct impact on the Group such as the European Working Time Directive
international financial reporting standards speed restrictions on the Group s vehicles and increased liberalisation of the market for postal t
service providers.

Without a continued change of culture within the organisation, future development may be affected

The changing and uncertain postal market place the impact of campetition and regulation and increased customer expectations place

mayor challenges on all employees to adapt and improve productivity to levels that will allow the business ta compete effectively These

challenges need to be met by ongoing cultural change within the organisation

Without a flexible efficient and co-operative culture Royal Mail could become loss making as mail volumes decline Significant industrial 1
action could have a major detrimental effect on the Group s reputation and profits

The Group may be affected by future environmental and related fiscal measures

The Group operates a large vehicle fleet and a substantial property portfolio that consume large amounts of energy Although the Group
15 disposing of surplus property and 1s deploying a Carbon Management Programme it may he affected by future envronmental
measures and adverse fiscal impact from increased energy costs and “green” taxation

The Group operates a substantial treasury operation and 1s exposed to foreign currency risk and fuel price risk

Foreign currency risk 1s due to trading with overseas postal operators for carrying UK mail abroad and delivering foreign origin mail in the
UK revaluation of currency balances held to operate the Bureau de Change services and various sales and purchase contracts
denominated in foreign currency The fuel price risk arises from operating a large vehucle fleet and on jet fuel risk. from purchasing air
freight services If the treasury strategy does not fully cover the Groups exposures this could result in funds not being readily available
when required or a negative impact on profit due to mcreased costs

‘Operating and Financial Review (continued)
Summary

In 2010 the Group generated a strong set of results with operating profit growth of £83m and all businesses remaining profitable
despite revenue falling year on year for the first time in nearly 10 years This was achieved in a difficult trading environment impacted by
Tecessionary conditions an increasingly competitwe market place and a period of industrial action However the Group outturned with a
Tet trading cash outflow of over £500m This was attributable to the continued funding of the Group s pension obligations and investment.
im modernisation critical to the future success of the business

Royal Mail Letters improved their operating profit by over 100% year on year despite losing £143m of revenue This performance shows
that investment in modernisation 1s generating significant efficiencies AS volumes continue to fall competiuon intensifies and customers
switch to lower priced products this has to be offset by cost savings enabled by modernisation and revenue growth through the launch of
mnovative new products and services

Post Office Limited grew profits by £31m in 2010 despite a £70m fall in revenue largely in Government and Financial Services Savings
from transformation programmes and other tight cost control measures led to this improvement despite a decline in revenue of nearly
8% On 24 March 2010 a further funding package was agreed to help maintain the network although these arrangements remain subject
to State Aid approvat

The Groups parcel businesses operate in fiercely competitive markets and although recessionary conditions have put them under further
pressure they have performed strongly Parcelfarce Worldwide grew its profits by over 40% year on year through cost control coupled
with underlying revenue growth and a continued focus on quality of service GLS saw profit fall by 10% as difficult trading conditions in
Europe meant revenue decline could not be fully offset by cost savings However it still generated significant profits and achieved strong
margins for the Group ‘

Net trading cash outflow for the Group of £517m was driven by pension payments and investment in modernisation Funding on pension
obligations continues to be a heavy drain on the Groups cash resources with cash payments in excess of £850m The investment in
modernisation ts allowing operating profits to grow despite falling revenues

After another encouraging year the Groups performance 1s evidence of real pragress being made however big challenges remain The

continuing trend of deckne m traditional mail volumes may improve slightly as the UK economy recovers but will stil leave the Group

needing to explore and develop new revenue streams and to generate further efficiencies through continuation of modernisation A '
solution to the historic pension deficit and access to funding wilt also be cntical to ensure the long term success of the Group

Following the recent agreement with the union leadership Business Transformation 2010 and Beyond we are now well placed to build
upon this year’s progress Working together to deliver great products and services to the Groups customers 1s now more important than
ever before

organisations that are best able to assist it on the particular topic under discussion

marketplace was given by Monks Partnership (a trading name of PricewaterhouseCoopers) Deloitte LLP Hay Management Consultants and
Towers Watson Limited Internal support is primaniy pravided by the Acting Group HR Director, Jon Millidge, and from the Company Secretary

The Companys poticy on Directors remuneration is that

© the overall remuneration package should be sufficiently competitive to attract and retain executives of the necessary quality in a complex
business and a competitive marketplace who will detiver success for the shareholder and high levels of customer service safety and
environmentat performance

‘+ assignificant proporticn of the remuneration package should be dependent on performance - both short and long-term and
‘+ the system of remuneratian should bring together the interests of senior executives customers and the shareholder
The policy for senior executives takes into account pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group

The Committee regularly reviews the benefits package offered to its key executives and its competitiveness The Committee aims to ensure that
the package 1s proportionate and effective and that it follows accepted best practice

The main components of remuneration
The main components for executive Directors are bastc salary an annual performance-related bonus a Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
pension and other benefits The Committee believes that there should be a particular emphasis on performance-related elements

Base salaries

The Committee believes that base salaries should be set at levels that are sufficient to recruit and retain high calibre executives In making its
judgement the Committee considers information from several sources so that a fair comparison can be made with enterpnses af a similar size
and complexity to Royal Mail This data is provided by independent consultancies usually based on the published annual reports of other
organisations Increases are recommended where the Committee believes that it 1s necessary to reflect contribution mcreased individual
responsibilities and market levels The Secretary of States consent ts required for all rmaterial changes to Directors remuneration

In the light of the general economic circurnstances no increases to base salary were awarded to the Chief Executive or the executive Directors
in respect of the 2009-10 salary review In 2008 it had been agreed that the salaries of lan Duncan and Alan Cook would increase to
£350 000 and £300 000 a year respectively These increases were to apply in two phases with the second due on 1 July 2009 At the request
of lan Duncan and Alan Cook these second increases were postponed and will be implemented on 11 July 2010 in the case of lan Duncan Alan
Cook having left the Company at the end of March 2010 Consequently no executive Director received a pay increase in 2009-10

European Union and as they apply to the finanaal statements of the Group for the year ended 28 March 2010 The principal accounting
policies adopted by the Group are set out in note 2

2 Accounting pol

es

Basis of preparation and accounting

The Group comprises Royal Mait Haldings pic (the Company) - which 1s wholly owned by HM Government - and its subsidiaries The Company

1s incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006 (the Act) and the financial statements are produced in accordance with

the Act and applicable IFRSs I

‘The Group financial statements are presented in sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest £m except where otherwise mdicated

Royal Mai! Group Ltd a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company may be exposed to the risk of being fined by its industry Regulator and of I
being required to pay compensation to certain customers as a result of falling to meet operational targets set by the Regulator in its licence In

this situation the amount of such fines and compensation will be determined by the Regulator after further representations from Royal Mail

Group Ltd and no further information will be disclosed on the grounds that st can be expected to prejudice the outcome of that process

Changes in accounting policy and disclosures.
The accounting palicies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year except as follows

The Group has adopied the following new and amended accounting standards as af 30 March 2009 The impact on the financial statements or
performance of the Group is also descnbed below

JERS 7 Financial Instruments disclosures

‘The amended standard requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements and liquidity risk Fair value measurements related to
tems recorded at fair value are to be disclosed by source of inputs using a three level fair value hierarchy by class for all financial instruments
recognised at fair value In addition a reconatation between the beginning and ending balance for level 3 fair value measurements 1s now
required as well as significant transfers between levels in the fatr value hierarchy The amendments also clarify the requirements for liquidity
nisk disclosures with respect to derwvative transactions and assets used for liquidity management The fair value measurement disclosures are
presented in note 24 The liquidity risk disclosures are not significantly impacted by the amendments and are presented in note 23

JFRS 8 Operating Segments

IFRS 8 replaced IAS 14 Segment Reporting upon its effective date The Group concluded that the operating segments determined in
accordance with IFRS 8 are the same as the business segments previously identified under IAS 14 IFRS 8 disclosures are shown in note 3
including the related revised comparative information

JAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements

The revised standard separates owner and non-owner changes in equity The statement of changes in equity includes only details of
transactions with owners with non-owner changes in equity presented in a reconciliation af each component of equity In adcition the
standard introduces the statement of comprehensive income and the option to present all items of recognised income and expense either in
one single statement or in twa linked statements The Group has elected to present two statements

JAS 23 Borrowmng Costs
The revised IAS 23 requires capitalisatvon of borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquistion construction or production of a
qualifying asset. The Groups previous policy was to expense borrowing costs as they were incurred In accordance with the transitional
Provisions of the amended IAS 23 the Group has adopted the standard on a prospective basis Therefore borrowing costs are capitalised on
qualifying assets with a commencement date for construction or development on or after 30 March 2009 Details of the borrowing costs
capitalised during the period are disclosed in note 3

Adopted improvements to IFRSs
The Group has now adopted the following relevant amendments issued by the IASB in May 2008 These changes have no material effect on
the financial statements.

. JERS 7 Financial Instruments Discosure Removal of reference to total interest income as a component of finance cost.

. JAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements Assets and liabilities classified as held for trading in accordance with IAS 39 Financial
dnstruments Recognition and Measurement are not automatically classified as current in the balance sheet

. JAS 8 Accounting Poles Change in Accountmg Estimates and Errors Clarification that only implementation guidance that is an
integral part of an IFRS 1s mandatory when selecting accounting policies

. JAS 10 Events after the Reporting Period Clarification that dividends declared after the end of the reporting period are not obligations,

. JAS 16 Property Plant and Equipment Replace the term “net selling price” with “fair value less costs to sell” Items of property plant
and equipment held for rental that are routmely sold in the ordinary course of business after rental are transferred to inventory when
rental ceases and they are held for sale

Royal Mail Holdings ple
2 Accounting policies (continued)
. JAS 18 Revenue Replacement of the term direct costs with transaction costs as defined by [AS 39 The IASB has also added guidance
to determine whether an entity is acting as a pnnapal or as an agent.
. JAS 19 Employee Benefits Revised the definition of past service costs return on plan assets and short-term and other long-term’

employee benefits Amendments to plans that result in a reduction in benefits related to future services are accounted for as
curtailment Deleted the reference to the recognition of contingent lrabilities to ensure consistency with IAS 37

. JAS 20 Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosures of Government Assistance Loans granted in future with no or law interest
rates will not be exempt from the requirement to impute interest The difference between the amount received and the discounted
amount 1s accounted for as government grant Also revised various terms used to be consistent with other FRSs

* AS 23 Borrowmg Costs The defirtton of borrowing costs 1s revised to consolidate the two types of items that are considered
components of borrowing costs into one the interest expense calculated using the effective interest rate method in accordance with
as 39

* AS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financal Statements When a parent entity accounts for a subsidiary at fair value in accordance with

IAS 39 m tts separate financial statements this treatment contmues when the subsidiary 1s subsequently classified as held for sale

* AS 28 Investment in Associates If an associate ts accounted for at fair value in accordance with IAS 39 only the requirement of IAS 28
to disclose the nature and extent of any significant restricuons on the ability of the associate to transfer funds to the entity in the form
of cash or repayment of loans applies

* (AS 31 Interest in Jont ventures fa jot venture 1s accounted for at fair value in accordance with AS 39 only the requirements of
JAS 31 to disclose the commutments of the venturer and the joint venture as well as summary financial information about the assets
liabilities income and expense will apply

. JAS 36 Impairment of Assets When discounted cash flows are used to estimate fair value tess costs to sell’ additional disclosure 1s
required about the discount rate, consistent with disclosures required when the discounted cash flows are used to estimate value in
use

. (AS 38 Intangible Assets Expenditure on advertising and promotional activities 1s recognised as an expense when the Group either has

the right to access the goods or has received the service

* JAS 39 Financial instruments Recognition and Measurement Changes in circumstances relating to derivatives are not reclassifications
and therefore may be either removed from or included in the fair value through profit and loss classification after initial recognition
Removed the reference in !AS 39 to a segment when determining whether an instrument qualifies as a hedge Require the use of the
Tevised effective interest rate when remeasuring a debt instrument on the cessation of fair value hedge accounting

Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions

The preparation of the Groups consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amaunts of assets and abilities at the reporting date However uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could
result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the asset or liability affected in future periods

The key sources of uncertainty that have a significant risk of causing material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and habilities
within the next financial year relate to the measurement of the defined benefit pension obligations deferred tax and ColleagueShare plan costs

Defined benefit pension obligations

Measurement of the defined benefit obligations requires certain assumptions to be made including on life expectancy future changes in
salaries inflation and a sutable discount rate The size of these obligations and therefore the pension deficit 1s matenally sensitive to the
assumptions adopted The assumptions which have the mast significant impact on the measurement of the defined benefit obligations are the
real discount rate and the mortality rates A 01 percentage point change to the discount rate could change the abilities by approximately
£660m An additonal one year on the life expectancy could increase liabilives by approximately £900m The mayor assumptions and carrying
value of the obligations are disclosed in note 25

Deferred tax

Assessment of the deferred tax asset requires an estimation of future profitability Such estimation 1s inherently uncertain in a market subject
to various competitive pressures Shoutd estimates of future profitability change in future years the amount of deferred tax recognised will
also change accordingly The carrying values of the deferred tax assets and liabilities are included within note 9

ColteagueShare plan

The calculation of the ColleagueShare costs and liabilities 1s relrant on a number of judgements estimates and assumptions These include in
particular forecasts for the potential equity value of ColleagueShares, forecasts of jainers and leavers throughout the life of the plan and
judgements on when participants are likely to exercise their rights far the Company to redeem the ColleagueShares that they hold The
Magnitude of the costs involved 1s sensitive to these forecasts and assumptions The carrying values of the ColleagueShare liabilities are
included within notes 20 and 21

Funding

Royal Mail Group Ltd
Royal Mail Group Ltd continues to face considerable cash requirements with respect to its investment in modernisation and funding its pension
deficit at a time when the mails market has been opened up to full competition and there 1s ongoing volatility in mail volumes

On 23 March 2007 a funding package totalling £1 bn was completed with Government and for which State Ard clearance was received in
Apnt 2009 The £900m senior debt facility expires in March 2014 It has been assumed that another faciity will be negouated to be available
by this time The remaining £300m subordinated loan was fully drawn in March 2009 and wall not be repaid until the later of the unconditional
release of the monies held in escrow for the Royal Mail Pension Plan Trustee (the Trustee) or 19 March 2016

In making an assessment on Royal Mail Group Ltds ability to continue as a going concern the Directors have
* assumed the successful execution of the modernisation plan, which ts reflected in detailed plans and supported by financial forecasts

‘+ assumed that an affordable payment profile will be agreed with the Trustee The 2009 scheme valuation, together with agreement of the
revised schedule of payments 15 due to be completed by 30 June 2010 The pension deficit has mcreased since 2006 and repayment of
the deficit 1s now likely to need to extend beyond the 13 years remaining of the 17 year repayment profile agreed in 2007 {i 1s assumed
that the pension escrow established in 2007 will continue to be required and

* considered the ongoing volatility m the mails market along with the risk of greater market decline than forecast which creates
uncertainties around the financial projections and, consequently the funding and headroom requirements of Royal Mail Group Ltd
Current cash forecasts indicate cash funding headroom will need to be carefully monitored over the next few years and in the absence of
any modest increase in property values over the next few years there is a potential breach of the Loan to Value covenant on the Group
semior debt faciity at March 2012 The Directors have identified a portfolio of operational acons and strategic options including potential
asset disposals that will be taken to reduce the loan requirements and enable the covenant to be met or provide additional funding to
mitigate any headroom exposures In addition the Directors have informed Government that they may seek to negotiate a change to the
covenants Any changes agreed wall be on a commercial basis

On the basis of careful consideration of the cash flow projections and the above considerations the Directors have concluded that it 1s
appropriate that the financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basts

Post Office Limited
Post Office Limited had net liabilities as at 28 March 2040 but has operated at a profit before exceptional items during 2009-30 for the
second year running

To become viable in the longer-term new business areas continue to be developed and grown in order to replace the lost contribution from

appropriate Financial abilities within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as either financial liabilities at fair value through the income statement
or financial tabilittes measured at amortised cost

The Group determines the classification of its financial instruments at initial recognition and re-evaluates this designation at each financial year
end When financial instruments are recognised initially they are measured at fair value bemg the transaction price plus in the case of
financial instruments not at fair value through the mcome statement any cirectly attributable transactional costs

‘The subsequent measurement of financial instruments depends on their classification as follows

Financial assets at fair value through the income statement (held for trading)

Financial assets are classified as held for trading if they are acquired for sale im the short term Derwatives are also classified as held for
trading unless they are designated as hedging instruments Assets are carried im the balance sheet at fair value with gains or losses recognised
In the income statement.

cost using the effective interest rate method if the time value of money 1s significant Gains and losses are recognised in the mcome statement
when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired as well as through the amortisation process

Available for sale financial assets

Available for sale financial assets are non-derwative financial assets that are designated as such or are not classified in any of the three
Preceding categories After initial recognition interest 1s taken to the income statement using the effective :nterest rate method and the assets
are measured at fair value with gains or losses being recognised as a separate component of equity until the mvestment 1s derecognised or

until the investment 1s deemed to be impaired at which time the cumulative gain or lass previously reported in equity 1s mcluded in the income
statement

Financial habilites at fair value through the income statement (held for trading)
Denvatives liabilities are classified as held for trading unless they are designated as hedging instruments They are carned in the balance sheet
at fair value with gains or losses recognised in the income statement.

Financial habilities measured at amortsed cost

All non-denvative financial liabilities are classified as financial liabilities measured at amortised cost Non-derwvative financial habilities are
initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received less directly attributable issue costs After initial recognition non-derivative

Derivative financial instruments
The Group uses derivative mstruments such as foreign currency contracts in order ta manage the nsk profle of any underlying risk exposure of
the Group in line with the Groups treasury management policies Such derwative financial instruments are initially stated at farr value

For the purpose of hedge accountng hedges are classified as cash flow hedges where they hedge exposure to vanability in cash flows that 1s
either attributable to a particular nisk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecasted transaction

In relation to cash flow hedges to hedge the foreign exchange risk of firm commitments that meet the conditions for hedge accounting, the
Portion of the gain ar loss on the hedging instrument that 1s determined to relate to an effectwe hedge 1s recognised directly in equity and the
effective portron is recognised in the mcome statement

When the hedged firm commitment results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or non-financial lability then at the time the asset or
hhabilty 1s recognised the associated gains or losses that had previously been recognised in equity are mcluded in the mitial measurement of
the acquisition cost or ather carrying amount of the asset or liability For all other cash flow hedges the gains or losses that are recognised in
equity are transferred to the income statement in the same year in which the hedged firm commitment affects the net profit/loss for example
when the future sale actually occurs

For denvatives that do nat qualify for hedge accounting any gains ar losses arising from changes in fair value are taken directly to the income
‘statement in the period

Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or 1s sold terminated or exercised or no longer qualifies for hedge

accounting At that port any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is kept in equity until the forecast

transaction occurs If a hedged transaction 1s no longer expected ta occur the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity 1s transferred to i
the mcome statement for the year

Fair value measurement of financial mstruments I
The fair value of quoted investments (including conventional gilt edged secunties index-inked gilt edged securities and Treasury bills) 1s

determined by reference to bid prices at the close of business on the balance sheet date Hence the conventional gilt edged securities index- I
inked gilt edged secunties and Treasury bills are wathin Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy as defined within IFRS 7 I

Where there Is no actwe market fair value is determined using valuation techniques These include using recent arm's length market
transactions reference to the current market value of another instrument which is substantially the same and discounted cash flow analysis
and pricing models Specifically in the absence of quoted market prices derivatives are valued by using quoted forward prices for the
underlying commodity/currency and discounted using quoted interest rates (both as at the close of business on the balance sheet date) Hence
derivative assets and liabilities are within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as defined within (FRS 7

For the purposes of disclosing the fair value of nvestments held at amortised cost in the balance sheet in the absence of quoted market prices
fair values are calculated by discounting the future cash flows of the financial instrument using quoted equivalent interest rates as at close of
business on the balance sheet date

Derecogaition of financial instruments:
A financial asset or liability 1s derecognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold cancelled or expires

Income tax and deferred tax
The charge for current taxation ts based on the results for the year as adjusted for items that are non-assessable or disallowed it 1s calculated
using rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date

Deferred tax is provided using the lability method on all temporary differences at the balance sheet date, between the tax bases of assets and

Accounting standards and mterpretations not applied

The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) has issued accounting standards relevant to the Group with an effective date far

the impact of these below

International Accounting Standards (IFRSS/IAS) Effective date

IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures {revised November 2009) 4 January 2011
IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements (revised January 2008) 1 July 2009

IFRS 3 Business Combinations

The Group has not early adopted the revised IFRS 3 and so will apply it prospectively to all business combinations on or after 29 March 2010
‘The key features of the revised IFRS 3 include a requirement for acquisition-related costs to be expensed and not included in the purchase
price and for contingent consideration to be recognised at fair value on the acquisition date (with subsequent changes recognised in the
imeome statement and not as a change to goodwill) The standard also changes the treatment of non-controlling interest (formerly minonty
interest) with an option to recognise these at full fair value as at the acquisition date and for previously held non-controlling interest to be fair
valued as at the date control 1s obtained with gains and losses recognised in the mcome statement. It s expected that the reviston to this
standard wall not have a material impact on the finanaaal position or performance of the Group

IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures

This revised standard provides an exemption from disclosure requirements for transactions between entities controlled jointly controlled or
significantly mfluenced by the same government and between such entities and the government itself unless they are individuatly or
collectively significant The standard also amends the definition of a related party to remove some inconsistencies This standard which will be
adopted with a commencement date of 28 March 2011 wall not have a maternal impact on the financial postion or performance of the Group

's applied The revised standard applies retrospectively with some exceptions IAS 27 revised no longer restricts the allocation to minonty
interest of lasses incurred by a subsidiary to the amount of the non-cantrolling equity investment in the subsidiary A partial disposal of equity
interest in a subsidiary that does not result in a loss of control will be accounted for as an equity transaction and will have no impact on
goodwill nor will t gve rise to any gain or loss Where there is loss of control of a subsidiary any retained interest will have to be re-measured
to fair value which will impact the gain or loss recognised on disposat This standard will be adopted with a commencement date of 29 March
2010 and will have no matenal impact on the financial position or performance of the Group

The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards will have a material impact on the Groups primary financial statements
Certain of the above standards may require amendment to disclosures in the period of inital application

Improvements to IFRSs not yet adopted

tn May 2008 and April 2009 the IASB tssued amendments to its standards primarily with a view to removing inconsistencies and clarifying
warding There are separate transitional provisions for each standard The Group has adopted the relevant 2008 amendments as detailed on
page 52

‘The Group has not yet adopted the following relevant 2009 amendments which will be revewed to understand the possible impact on the

It is and has been throughout the year under review the Groups policy that no speculative trading in financial instruments shall be
undertaken

The mam nsks arising from the Group s financial instruments are interest rate risk liquidity risk foreign currency risk, commodity price and
credit risk The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summansed below

interest rate risk

The Groups exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to the Groups debt obligations and interest bearing financial
assets The BIS loans to Royal Mail Group Ltd of £1177m (2009 £800m) are at a fixed interest rate to maturity with an average maturity
date of 2018 (2009 - average date of 2020) The BIS loans to Post Office Limited of £343m (2009 £232m) are at short-dated fixed interest

Foreign currency risk

‘The Group 1s exposed to foreign currency risk due to trading with overseas postat operators for carrying UK mail abroad and delivering
foreign origin mail in the UK the balances held to operate the Bureau de Change services within Post Office Limited and various purchase
contracts denominated in foreign currency These risks are mitigated by hedging pragrammes managed by Group Treasury Where possible
exposures are netted internally and any remaining exposure is hedged using a combination of external spot and forward contracts Hedging
wall not normally be considered for exposures of tess than £1m and hedging ts normally canfined to 80% of the forecast exposure where
forecast cash flows are highly probable

The Groups obligation to settle with overseas postal operators 1s denominated in Special Drawing Rights (SORs) - a basket of currencies
comprising of US dollar (US$) Japanese yen sterling and euro Group Treasury operates a rolling 18-month hedge programme, which 1s
subsequently reviewed on a quarterly basis There has been no external SOR hedge i place throughout the financial year 2009-10

For the Bureau de Change business balances of major currency holdings are hedged aiong with minor currencies showing a closely
correlated movernent

The Group s obligations to settle conveyance charges in USS has been partially hedged (to April 2011)
The Group has three active hedge programmes covering obligations to settle euro invoices on automation projects

The Group does not hedge the translation exposure created by the net assets of its overseas subsidiaries However it does hedge the
transactional exposure created by inter-company loans with these subsidiaries

Credit risk

Royal Mail operates a credit policy which provides a fair and equitable arrangement for all ts account customers The level of credit granted

Tegulated products area so as to ensure that Royal Mail 1s not i breach of compliance legislation Assessment of credit for the non-
regulated products is based an commercial factors which are commensurate with the Groups appetite for risk

Royal Mail has a dedicated credit management team which sets and monitors credit limits and takes corrective action as and when

With respect to credit risk arising from other financial assets of the Group which comprise cash, cash equvalent investments available for
sale financial assets held to maturity financial assets held for trading financial assets loans and receivables financial assets and certain
derivative instruments the Group invests/trades only with high quality financial institutions The Groups exposure to credit risk arses from

There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group

Liquidity risk

Payment of £521m (2009 £549m) was made during the year in respect of regular future service contributions, with £516m (2009 £543m)
relating to RMPP The regular future service contributions charge for RMPP expressed as a percentage of pensionable pay has remamed at
200% effective from April 2006 This rate 1s not expected to change materially during 2010-11 For RMSEPP, these contributions have
remained at 48 2% (2009 48 2%)

Payment of £291m (2009 £290m) was made during the year to fund the defiat in the schemes with £286m (2009 £285m) relating to
RMPP Deficit recovery payments are planned for RMPP aver the 17 years from the date of the latest full actuanal vatuation These
payments will be made before each 31 March and may therefore span across the Groups year end (the last Sunday in March) Over the 16
years from 31 March 2007 planned deficit payments are £260m per annum increasing in line with RPI (base year 1s 2006-07) For
RMSEPP deficit recovery payments will be £5m per annum from 1 Apnl 2007 to 31 December 2015

A liability of £1m (2009 £1m) has been recognised for future payment of pension benefits to a past Director (see page 43 Directors
Remuneration Report)

On 23 March 2007 the Group established £1bn of investments in escrow as secunty to the Royal Mal Pension Plan in support of the 17
year deficit recovery period

The following disclosures relate to the gains/losses and deficit in the schemes recognised for the RMPP and RMSEPP defined benefit plans in
the financial statements of the Group
a) Major assumptions

The size of the pension deficit which is large in the context of the Group and its finances 1s materially sensitive to the assumptions adopted
‘Small changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact an the deficit and overall income statement charge The major
assumptions were

At 28 March 2010 At 29 March 2009
“pa %pa
Rate of increase in sataries 46 42
Rate of imcrease in pensions and deferred pensions 36 32 i
Discaunt rate 56 64
Inflation assumption 36 32
Expected average rate of retum on assets 67 69

The above assumptions relate to both defined benefit plans with the exception of the expected average rate of return on assets which is
computed for the combined assets of the plans The expected average rate of return on assets 1s a weighted average of the long-term
expected rate of return of each principal asset class (see section b) The expected average rate of retum 1s computed at each balance sheet
date based on the market values and long-term rate of return of each principal asset class as at that date

Mortality

The mortality assumptions for the larger scheme are based on the latest self admmustered pension scheme (SAPS) mortality tables (S1PMA.
for male pensioners and S1DFA for female pensioners) with appropriate scaling factors (106% for mate pensioners and 101% for female
Pensioners) allowing for medium cohort projections with a 1 25% floor These are detailed below
