Re: Hogsthorpe 200202Notes Link

Gary,

I have read the recent emails on the above and considered the information I am concerned if we
swap the processor now and the errors stop this could lead to (i) a claim that Horizon has
problems in its accuracy and fuel some of the recent press articles and (ii) the SPMR will claim
that all previous errors are down to Horizon and we have no way to disprove this if everything is
resolved when the new processor is installed.

Point (i) above would also concern me as I have no doubt this individual is not the only one that
uses Smartpost in this way so we could end up with other claims in respect of this issue where
we have insisted the SPMR makes the loss good.

POL00021163

I would prefer a more staged approach be taken to this issue where we try to identify the problem
by a method that will eliminate potentially different scenarios - I am not sure how easy or difficult
this would be to do but if this SPMR was for example removing money from the till and he
stopped doing this when the processor is removed we have not proved it was the processor that
was at fault all we have stopped is money going missing.

I think we need to think this one through carefully and the SPMR should be providing evidence to
support his claims which can be investigated before we change pieces of equipment.

If you wish to discuss please give me a ring.
Regards

John

Fujitsu have always had a preventative maintenance policy and therefore sometimes will swap
out kit without actually finding a fault, also it generally helps with customer perception of the
service they have received.

I accept in this instance that this policy could work against us, but are you suggesting that if after
swapping the processor, and all discrepancies cease that Tom will claim that is clear proof of
Horizon creating discrepancies?. I strongly suggest that Tom obtains the necessary evidence
now, if it is available.

I'm not trying to be obstructive but at present we have nothing to work on.

I am not sure why Fujitsu would be changing the processor if they didn't think there was a
problem.

Having spoken to Tom today, once the new processor is install he is going do a BP rollover and
then keep a tally manually of every Smartpost item to check against Horizon. This however won't
help with anything that has gone previously.

+ Fujitsu would not check a replaced processor automatically but I don't believe that would add
any value in this instance.

+ As we discussed last week the most likely explanation was / is user error but given the calls
into NBSC and HSD we should assume that this is not the root cause at this time.

+ However Kicking off any other type of investigation is dependant on transactional evidence of
Smartpost suspend creating discrepancies. Does Tom have any ? I assume he believes that
Horizon is committing each mail item/costs each time that he goes into suspend and
therefore on multiple occasions?

If Tom has specific information such as transaction time and values ,please send this across and
I will get Fujitsu to investigate immediately. If has no evidence them I'm afraid there is nothing for
Fujitsu to investigate.

Further to our conversation last week regarding the losses at Hogsthorpe, the spmr, David
Hedges (who likes to be known as Tom) has contacted the NBSC to establish what the
bau/correct process is for suspending a session of Smartpost. Tom tells me that the NBSC said it
was okay to use either of the methods he describes, as a reminder I have copied information
below in respect of what described to me last week.
POL00021163
POL00021163

Tom said that he does a lot of postage and customers come
in leave their items of mail and a blank cheque, so they
don’t have to wait. He then processes the items in between
serving other customers. Previously he would have several
items on the sales stack, items for which labels had been
printed and if a customer came in he would suspend the
session, from the Smartpost screen and serve other
customers before going back and swapping back into the
suspended session. This would take him straight back to
the Smartpost screen, but when he initially suspended the
session it would take a long time, as it also did when he
swapped to go back into the suspended session. Around the
time the losses started he changed how he suspended the
session. Items in the sales stack and in Smartpost, when a
customer came in he started going back to serve customer,
suspending the session from there, would serve other
customers and then swap to go back into the suspended
session, by doing it this way it took him back to the serve
customer screen and both the suspending of the session and
returning back into the suspended session was far quicker
this way, than how he did it previously.

Tom also spoke to HSH yesterday about this and also the losses which he believes have started
since he changed his procedures, ref E-1318562. I understand from Tom that a visit has now
been arranged for today to swap the central processor. Once this swap out has been completed
can you tell me whether any investigation is carried out with the old processor.

As I mentioned last week if losses continue then I could end up with a conduct case. If this does
happen then the spmr will have the opportunity of attending an interview, in which I am sure he
will raise what he believes is an issue with Smarpost suspended session contributing to losses at
the branch. At this point it will have to be investigated, I therefore feel it would be beneficial to do
this now and would appreciate your help with this.

I have cc'd David Southall in as I am on annual leave from tomorrow and do not return until
22.07.09, David will be covering any urgent matters in my area during my absence.

Thanks
