Chairman and Chief Executive's Statement

The Group delivered record quality of service to our customers in 2006-07 and secured a vital commercial funding package for the
modernisation of the Company while profits fell as a result of a significant increase in pension costs Looking to the future, f we are
to continue on our sourney to become the worlds best and most trusted postal service we must now take action to meet the
challenges of securing a viable pension scheme for our people dealing with the impact of both substantially increased competition
and falling mail valumes and building a tong term sustainable Post Office® network Modernising our letters business remains
central to our strategy as we are competing in an open carnpetitive market where despite all the improvements we have made we
are still 40% less efficient than our rivals ~ because they have already invested in the technology that provides more efficent
operations

For Royal Mail this has been a critical period during which we have worked to create the platform from which we can achieve success
1m the competitive market and secure a strong future for the business The building blocks we have now put m place include

* Around £4bn funding package from the Government to enable us to modernise the business

* Agreement with the unions on the flexibility and changes in working practices that are vital if we are to modernise
successfully, and

* Support for the pension reform needed to allow us to become competitive and protect a Defined Benefit pension scheme
for our existing employees

The Group's achievements so far

Remarkable progress has been made since we embarked on our transformation in 2002 Five years ago the Group was losing well
over £1m every day failing its quality of seruce targets and facing a downward cycle of decime unless it cut costs and renewed its
focus on customers It was in no position to compete in a market that was moving towards full competition in January 2006

Today, its clear that we have come along way As the table below illustrates. we have achieved significant cost savings with the
Company employing 45 000 fewer people At the same time customers have received the best letters quality of service performance
against target on record with targets achieved for both First and Second Class stamped mail as well as for business mail Operating
Profit m 2006-07 was in line with expectations at £233m although this was down on the previous year as a result of mcreased
pension costs

from operations”, which excluded benefits/charges relating to pension funding surpluses/deficits

** Equivalent to profit from operations of £609m consistent with UK GAAP accounting policies as applied im 2004-05

In addition, Parcelforce Worldwide has made an operating profit for the second year running after more than 15 consecutive years
of losses Meanwhile the Groups European parcels bustness General Logistics Systems (GLS), has continued to build on its
Teputaton as a leading player in the European market place and has increased its revenues and profits A sertes of operational
changes have been embedded in Royal Mail Letters including the move to a single dally delivery nearly two decades after it was first
mooted In the Post Office® network new products and services have been launched to help replace lost revenue from traditional
Government business

Funding

Finalising with our Shareholder, the Government the details of nearly £4 billion of investment for the Group was a major task over
‘the last 18 months Crucially this has at last put in place the financing to carry out the modernisation thats essential for us to
compete effectively agaist intensifying competition - not just from rival mail companies but also from other forms of communication
including broadband internet In addition, the Government has allowed us to allocate 20% of the value generated through the efforts
of everyone in the business over the next few years in the form of ColleagueShares The ColleagueShare scheme which is worth up
to £5 300 for each of our people over five years depending on performance 1s a recognition of the critical rote they wilt play in the
modernisation of the Group and mn achieving the stretching targets we have set ourselves The table below summanses the funding
package

Debt facility on commercial terms to modernise Royal Mail Letters operations £12 billion

2006-07 Financial Performance

Our financial performance in 2006-07 was adversely impacted by a number of factors including nsing competitor activity falling
mail volumes mail customers trading down to lower-priced services and the continuing losses im the Post Office® network However
the single largest negative impact has been the rise in pension fund costs, which continue to represent a long-term risk for the
Group The table below summanses financial performance in 2006-07

Other businesses 35, 8 13 17
Group 9,179 9.056 233 355

Looking in more detail at the Group’s performance in 2006-07:
© Group externat revenue rose 14% to £9 2 billion boosted by strong performances by Parcelforce Worldwide and GLS
which together contributed just over half of the revenue increase,

* Group operating profit fell by a third to £233m However operating profit included the benefit for the first time of £75m
from the Governments Social Network Payment to support loss-making Post Office® branches - from the half-year point
onwards this payment is treated as revenue Underlying profit m 2006-07 was £158m - less than half the previous years
£355m profit on a like-for-tke basis

© Inland addressed mail volumes fell by 2 3% - the first decline after many years of growth The growth in ematl
undoubtedly played a key factor an the fall and the realistic prospect facing the Company is for further volume declme The
peak in mail volumes looks likely to be behind us

© Post Office Limited continued to grow revenues from new products and services but further declines in its traditional
Government business leading to lower customer footfall and sales meant its underlying revenues - excluding the benefit
of the £75m Soctal Network Payment - last year fell by £45m Its underlymg loss on the same basis increased by 57% to
£174m

© Parcelforce Worldwide grew its revenue by 7 3% in a market that became even tougher, and delivered a record operating
profit of £10m and

© GLS grew its revenues by 4 9% ma very competitive market and its operating profit increased to £115m The results of
both GLS and Parcelforce Worldwide demonstrate the Groups potential in areas where it 1s allowed to compete freely
without regulatory constraint

The challenges facing the Group have been underlined in the first part of the new financial year (2007-08) which shows a distinct
deterioration in Roya! Mail Letters revenue

The challenge of rising pension fund costs

The cost of servicing the Company s pension plans rose steeply m 2006-07 by £193m to £722m and accounted for the bulk of the
drop in the Groups profit In addition the Group faces making cash payments to the pension fund of around £800m annually for 17
years to cover both ongoing contributions and the funding of the deficit At the year-end the defiatt stood at £5 0 billion in
accounting terms Against this backdrop it 1s clear that if the Group 1s to be successful as a business in the future it must tackle its
long-term pension fund obligations

Thats why we have recently outlined a series of proposals on which we are shortly to consult our people and other stakeholders -
and which now have the support of the unions as part of our agreements on pay modernisation and pension reform Our number
one pnonty 1s to protect our existing peoples pensions in a way that 1s affordable to the Company and which does not expose our
people or the business to unacceptable risk going forward The outline of the proposals is

* No mcrease m employee contributions
* Keeping a defined benefit scheme for existing employees

» — An increase in the normal retirement age from 60 to 65 with effect from 1 April 2010 Employees could still retire at 60 if
they chose but any pension earned from Apni 2010 would be reduced if taken before the age of 65

* — Pension benefit earned fromm 1 Apri! 2008 would be calculated on a Career Average Revalued Earnings basis an approach
that has emerged from our discussions with the unions over recent months,

* Pension benefits earned to 1 April 2008 would remain in place with the rate at which they grew in future continuing to be
linked to final salaries, and

* Closing the current defined benefit plan to new members on 31 January 2008 with a defined contribution scheme to
replace tt

Royal Mail Holdings plc
Chairman and Chief Executive's Statement (contmued)

We antiapate that the Company's current level of contributions to the pension plan - equivatent to 30% of the pensionable pay bill -
will reduce to 22% in five years time still well ahead of the average UK contribution

The challenge of increased competition and a declining market

Its clear that competition has developed much mare quickly than anyone forecast When the tough control on our prices was fixed
Postcomm forecast that nvals in 2006-07 woutd be handling around 1 9 billion letters under access arrangements to Royal Matl
Letters delivery network In fact the competition picked up 2 4 billion letters mn 2006-07 - one in every eight posted - and we
expect from current volumes that nvals will this year be handling around 4 billion letters around one letter in every five posted This
was a level Postcomm had forecast would not be reached until 2010 At the same time the average 13p revenue Royal Mail Letters
receives for delivering access mail does not cover our costs and this has generated a loss of £44m in 2006-07 heavily driven by the
growth m competition through access to our delivery network

The 23% overall decline m the UK inland addressed mail market this year mirrors emerging trends in many other European
countries The expectation in Europe and elsewhere 1s for a continuing decline of 2-3% a year The fall in the market 1s at odds with
the prediction for a 1-2% annual rise in volumes on which the control on Royal Mail Letters prices was set

Itts not surprising therefore given that mail volumes have mn fact fallen under a pricing regime that anticipated volume increases
that for the first time, Royal Maul Letters made a loss - of £12m -in the sector which is price controlled This area, comprising
revenues of just under £6 billion 1s by far the biggest part of the mails business and the loss contrasts with a profit of £197m the
previous year The pressures on the business were further underlined by the thin profit of ust £27m we made m 2006-07
delivening the one-price-goes-anywhere Universal Service This 1s despite Royal Mail Letters achieving a 3% year on year efficiency
gain

In summary the reality we face 1s,
* The mail market in the UK is declining by around 2 5% per year
‘© Royal Mait 1s losing 40% of bulk business mail to rival postal operators
© Overall this year rivals will handle one in five of all letters posted in the UK

© Our rivals are 40% more efficient not because their people work harder but because they have already modernised ~ as we
must now do - and have much more technology and

* Our nvals pay their people 25% less than we do at Royal Mail

The challenge of building a sustainable Post Office® network

The loss on operations in 2006-07 was £99m This result included, for the first time, six months worth of the Government's £150m
annual Social Network Payment to support the costs of loss-making branches Without this sum the underlying loss was £174m -
£63m higher than the previous year

Even with this added Government revenue which Post Office Limited has warmly welcomed, losses at the current level are clearly
unsustainable and the business has embarked on a wide-ranging plan to create a strong and viable network in the long-term with
the £17 billion financing provided by the Government

A key prionty 1s to address the Crown network, where £70m was lost in 2006-07 Following a successful trial in 2006-07 involving
a retail partnership under which stx Crown branches were transferred to WH Smith branches agreement was reached in April 2007
to the transfer of a further 70 branches to the retailer However, this 1s just one step of many that have to be taken across the whole
of the network Another key challenge in the current year is to implement the closure programme agreed with Government, with our
role being to ensure the most accessible network possible within the stringent criteria laid down by the Government We will do our
utmost to ensure that as many people as possible are as clase as possible to a Post Office® branch

Underlying revenues fell last year by £45m This reflected the continuing effects of payments of henefits directly into bank accounts
a decline in the number of car tax licences issued in branches as motorists stepped up their use of the DVLA web site, the
replacement of the E111 forms with the issue of the European Health Insurance Card and the loss of the BBC Licence contract
However, the revenue loss was partly offset by increased income from new products and services Post Office Limited now covers 1
in 50 of all cars insured in the UK, while strong revenue growth for HomePhone the Post Office@’s telephony business brought in
new income The Instant Saver accounts also performed well with a keenly competitive high interest rate that attracted almost £2
bilhon of deposits in the year The Post Office® has now won more than one million financial services customers making it the
fastest growing financial services provider in a highly competitive market

Our current trading and outcome of industrial action

The current year has seen a sharp fail in revenues In the letters business with income in the first five months of 2007-08 to the end
of August down £78m on the same period in the previous year The revenue fall came despite a nse im postage prices in April 2007
Overall revenue across the Group fell £39m excluding the impact of the Government s Social Network Payment to support loss~
making Post Office® branches

The emerging picture ts that the combination of pension costs revenue decline through losses to competition and the overall fall in
mail volumes means that Royal Mail s letters business is heading towards breakeven m the current financial year Combined with the
continued losses we will see in the Post Office® network and expected profits from Parcelforce Worldwide and GLS this means that
the Group as a whole ts expected to be near breakeven in the current financial year or return a small profit Without the contribution
from GLS, the Group could again become loss-making

Chairman and Chief Executive's Statement (continued)

The immediate outlook 1s difficult. The UK postal market has changed for ever under competition and Royal Mail Letters stark choice ts to
modernise or face stagnation and decline We continue to make progress with much-needed changes to our operations but we must
move faster and further and we know the importance of bringmg our people with us as we transform the Company

This therefore has been a cnitical pend in the history of Royal Mail On top of securing the £4 billion package from our Shareholder to
fund cur modernisation a mayor milestone in the history of Royal Mail was achieved im October this year when the Company reached
agreement with the Communication Workers Union on pay modernisation and pension reform The agreement gives us the flexibility we
need to transform our operations so that we can compete effectively against nvals who have already modernised and so have lower costs
and prices Some key points in the agreement include

‘* Full cooperation and support on the deployment of new technology:
* Ensuring all our peoples paid work hours are utilised,
* — Covenng for one another within a unit - and within paid hours - to help absorb colleagues absence or an increase in workload

* Rebalancing the normal working pattern to reflect the traffic profile {such as higher or lower levels of mail on certain days of the
week) and

‘* The agreement with the CWU also secures their support for the Company's overall proposed pension reform as outlined earlier

Once again we would like to apologise to our customers for the problems they have experienced in recent months because of the
industnal action and assure them that we will all be working hard tagether restore the great quality of service they have come to expect.

The onty option Is to modernise

‘To meet the challenge of improving our efficiency and productwity the only option for Royal Mail Letters 1s to modernise There ss no way
to avoid this challenge There has been under-investment for decades and we now have a unique opportunity to use the £1 2 billion
available at commercial interest rates from our Shareholder to replace obsolete equipment, accelerate the pace of new technology and
provide our postmen and women with the tools to work efficiently

The agreement from our Shareholder for a ColleagueShare scheme will play a significant role in ensunng our people are rewarded for
their efforts as we transform the business The first batch of ColleagueShares has just been issued and the twice-yearly updates on ther
value will be important indicators of the progress we are all making as well as demonstrating to our people the tangible effect of their
efforts to modernise the Company

Much has already been achieved to transform our business but with the increasing pace of competition and the dechne in mail volumes
we are ali too aware of the scate of the challenges ahead We are therefore at a unique moment in the development of the Company
With aur finanang m place an incentive plan for our people launched consultabons underway on significant changes to our pension plan
and a ground breaking agreement reached with the CWU to modernise our business we can remain fully confident that the Company will
reach its goal of becoming demonstrably the worlds best and most trusted postal service

Royal Mail Holdings plc
Annual Review 2006-07

This was the year the UK postal industry changed forever The first full year of competition in the UK mail market saw major rival
companies fighting to take business from Royal Mail But our focus did not change - doing our best to serve our customers even
more effectively and efficiently Independently measured quality of service figures show world-class quality of service in 2006-07
with prices among the very lowest in Europe At the same ume investment for the future was agreed with the Goverment.

Our people - their year

‘We're continuing to engage with our people and listening to what they've got to say as part of our continuing commitment to make
Royal Mail a great place to work With the mvestment case now agreed theres a clear incentive to ensure we re in shape to provide
an even better and more efficient service Weekly Worktme Listenmg and Learning sessions remain an important way to do this

Our programme to tackle absenteeism across the business made further progress with support for people who are off sick and
rewards for those people who do not take any unplanned sick leave

Over the 2006-07 financial year, absence rates continued to fall below 5% Royal Mails incentive-based approach and improvements
im procedures to help people get back to work contributed to this performance This was a key factor in Royal Mail being able to offer
a consistently high quatity of service to its customers while also cutting costs

The winners in the last prize draw those who took no sick leave over the full year, qualified for £2000 worth of holiday vouchers
and 5 extra days off Additionally the programme has also improved support for people who are on sick leave and ensures they
receive prompt treatment and ongoing contact

The number of accidents resulting in people having to take 3 days or more off work continued to decrease ~ for the fifth year
running Tailored training and enhanced safety management helped achieve this

‘And there was further imnovation in ways for our people to seek confidential advice and different forms of support Anew
confidential and tegal advice line called HELP (Health and emotional well-being Employment advice Legal services and Practical
assistance) was launched An average of 1 700 calls were made each month on issues ranging from childcare advice to how best to
manage stress

We also recognise our people for the support they give to people and their communities Customers can norninate postmen and
ostwomen for the 1st Class People Awards Nominees include champion charity fundraisers community actwists and lifesavers

This year s overall winner was Grimsby postman Norman Walker, who helped save a man bacly inured in a car crash Hes one of
4,500 people at Royal Mail who are trained first-aiders Amongst the nominations were 28 examples of people saved by postmen
and women - the emergency services said 19 of these people would not be alive today had st not been for someone from Royal Mail
going to their aid

And its not just m the UK where our people are helping In Afghanistan, eight Royal Mail employees who are members of the
Terntonal Armys 88 Postal and Courier Management Royal Logistics Corps joined the 22-strong team from the Briush Forces Post
Office providing delivery, collection sorting and counter service to 6,000 servicemen and women

Gwing to charity

The long-standing reputation of our people for their generosity and chanty fund-raising has achieved another landmark this year
They have raised more than £m for the Groups nominated chanty Help the Hospices Just two years into their partnership The
partnership, which was the result of a company-wide vote, has now been extended for a further year

Much of this came through specially organised events, such as sponsoring the Help the Hospices team in the 2006 London
marathon 22 Royal Matt runners from across the UK including Chief Executive Adam Crozier, completed the 26 3 miles cheered on
by colleagues

The company also donated £250,000 in matched funding after the money collected by our people surpassed this figure

Over the tast 16 years, our people have made a big impact donating more than £30m through regular payroll giving to more than
200 chanties This earned Royal Mail a gold award from Pay Magazine in recognition of the continuing generosity of ts people

Postal innovation

The boom in internet shopping has also been an important development for Royal Mail At Christmas some 100 million items
ordered online were delivered from e-retailers to customers And the growth in online business has also led to more people using
catalogues to make their selection catalogues also delivered by Royal Mail

Royal Mail has also adapted to react to this demand Customers can now buy online postage By going to royalmail com, they can
ay for. download and print out their own stamps for letters and packets a full internet postal solution The same service is also
available through the popular eBay website

The way people pay for their mail changed in 2006-07 with the launch of Primg in Proportion This meant mail was classified not
only by weight but by its dimensions as well in order to bring our prices more into line with the costs of handling it Three categories
were introduced in August - Letter Large Letter and Packet We spent £10m telling our customers about the change by sending a
size-guide to every home and through a major media and advertising campaign The change was an important step towards fairer
prices so that they better reflected the true cost of handling items

Royal Mail Holdings plc
Annual Review 2006-07 (continued)

Regular mystery shopper surveys have shown that the awareness campaign has been a success We estimate that the number of
letters and parcels for which postage has been underpaid ts at the same level as it was before the move to Pricing in Proportion took
place further supporting the findings of the survey

Business customers were also able to take advantage of new products The Automated Standard Tarif Large Letter offers a

discount of between 6% to 9% to companies sending a minimum of 250 Large Letter-sized items that can be machine sorted
Cleanmail Advance will also make it easier for businesses sending more than 1 000 items with correct and machine-readable
addresses to claim discounts

Royal Mail took a significant step in shrinking the size of its carbon footprint by one-fifth The business signed a three-year deal with
EDF Energy to ensure that power for more than 2 000 Royal Mail buitdings came from renewable sources Other improvements.
included using double-deck tratlers for long-haul mail journeys which are able to carry 50% more letters than regular trailers and
mean fewer road journeys

Celebrating stamps
‘Stamps continued to make headlines across the world and it was the collection celebrating the music of The Beatles that became
like the band an internatronal best-seller

Canada Post offered the six stamp issue for sale across its own counters - the first time another countrys postal service had done so
with a Royal Mail issue Postmen from the local St John's Wood delivery office recreated the iconic “Fab Four on the zebra crossing”
from Abbey Road for a photo opportunity for the worlds media Sot Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and Let It Be also featured in
the collection of album covers

A set featuring football teams ‘who had won the World Cup was also issued in June as the 2006 championship was beginning in
Germany Stamps dedicated to marine life and Great British inventions were also released

Media coverage was also focused on the stamps released to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the abolition of the slave trade
They depicted Willam Wilberforce, Olaudah Equiano and other notable campaigners who fought to outlaw the trade

Post Office”: looking ahead

Detailed planning 1s underway to secure the long-term structure of the Post Office® following the Government s announcement in

Operating and Financal Review (continued)

Group Financial Analysis
In the following analysis all references to operating profit are before exceptional items

This year we report an operating profit of £233m compared to £355m for 2005-06 a fall of €£122m (34 4%) mamly driven by the
performance of Royat Mail Most other operational business units contributed to offsetting this decrease with General Logistics Systems
{GLS) improving profitability by £15m (15 0%) Post Office Limited by £12m (10 8%) and Parcelforce Worldwide by £5m (>100%)

External Revenue
Group external revenue increased by £123m (1 43) from £9 056m to £9,179m dren by increases in GLS, Post Office Limited,
Parcelforce Worldwide and Other, offset by a marginal decline in Royal Mail

Royal Mail revenue remained virtually flat declining by £2m (0 03%) despite an increase in average prices of around 5% for the regulated
area Revenue grew in International products and Special Delivery helping to maintain revenue year on year but these factors were
wholly offset by declining market volumes losses to Downstream Access (DSA) and customers downtrading to cheaper praducts

General Logistics Systems increased tts revenue by £45m (4 3%) from £1,037m to £1 082m driven by volume growth in domestic and
export parcels Parcelfarce Worldwide mcreased its revenue by £23m {7 3%) from £314m to £337m through higher volumes particularly
tn the business to consumer market Post Office Limited showed a revenue increase of £30m (3 6%) from £838m to £868m, although
removing the impact of the £75m Social Network Payment (SNP) received from Government there was an underlying decline in revenue
‘of £45m to £793m This reduction Is due to the revenue decline in Government and financial services exceeding the growth in revenue
from the telephony products stream

Costs (excluding exceptional items)
Total costs of £8,985m have increased from £8,733m by £252m (2 9%)

People costs of £6,145m represent 68 4% ot the Lroups cost base ang have increased year on year by £1//m (3U%) [nis Is prmanty
due to an increase in the Group's pensions cost of £193m This increase mainly relates to the higher cost of employing members of the
schemes principally due to an allowance for increased life expectancy and lower long-term interest rates The majonty of front line staff
received a 2 9% pay award effectwve from 3 April 2006 and an additional 1 0% productwity payment from 5 June 2006 This has been
more than offset by a decline in headcount in UK wholly owned subsidiaries of over 8 000 since March 2006 (primarily in Royal Mail) As a
result, underlying wages and salaries have actually fallen by £19m over the year

Distribution and conveyance casts of £1 237m representing 13 8% of the Group's cost base, have increased by £19m (1 6%) driven
mainly by GLS and Parcelforce Worldwide, and their associated costs of volume growth

Other operating costs of £1 603m, representing 17 8% of the Groups cost base have mcreased by £56m (3 6%) This nse 1s driven by
£46m cost of sales relating to Post Office Limited HomePhone product an mcrease in strategic initiative spend (£54m) aimed at
increasing the efficiency of operations, and depreciation costs (£19m), both primarily within Royal Mail The rise ts partially offset by
focused cost savings in other non-people expenditure categories, in areas such as computers, marketing and compensation across the
Group

redundancy) 51 24 interest rates
Within operating profit 773 553 The balance sheet pension deficit has decreased from £5 588m in

March 2006 to £4 985m The decrease in the deficit of £603m
principally relates to an actuarial gain of £340m and net pensions interest of £199m The majority of the actuanal gain arose due to
investment returns on the schemes assets being in line with market performance and therefore higher than the long-term expected rate
of return This gain is recorded in the statement of recognised mcome and expense The net pensions interest reflects the long-term
expected rate of return on the schemes assets, less the unwinding of the discount on the schemes liabilities Although liabilities are
higher than assets, the expected rate of return on these assets (biased toward equities) s substantially higher than the discount rate for
habilities (high quality corporate bond rate) resulting in a net interest credit This interest 1s recorded in the income statement after profit
before financing and taxation

As part of the new funding package the Group established £1bn of mvestments in escrow shortly before year end as secunty for the
Royal Mail Pension Plan, in support of the 17 year deficit recovery period from 31 March 2006

Deficit recovery payments by the Group more than doubled increasing by £130m (115%) Of this increase £68m was due to the tming
of the payments made with the balance (£62m) principally arising as a result of the latest full actuarial valuation of the Royal Mail
Pension Plan There have been no employee deficit contributions The Group has been contributing an average of some £140m per year
to fund the deficit m the Royal Mail Pension Plan lower in 2005-06 due to the timing of payments made This will increase to an
average of over £260m per annum from the beginning of 2007-08

Share of Profits im Joint Ventures and Associates

The Groups share of profits in joint ventures and associates of £39m (2006 £32m) comprises profits of £42m (2006 £41m) from
Camelot (The National Lottery operator), Post Office Limited s Bureau de Change joint venture (First Rate Exchange Services Holdings
Limited) and Quadrant our catering associate offset by a loss of £3m {2006 loss of £9m) from Post Office Limited s financial services
venture (Midasgrange Limited) The losses from Post Office Limited s financial services venture were planned and are a result of sales
and marketing expenditure to promote new products

Net Exceptional Items

Net exceptional items of £125m (2006 £143m) comprise operating exceptional costs of £243m (2006 £210m) partially offset by profits
of £118m fram property disposals {2006 £67m from property and business disposals) Operating exceptional costs include £180m
(2006 £75m) for redundancy and £64m (2006 £44m) for impairments less a £1m (2006 Eni) net exceptional provision release for
property In addition the pnor year mcluded a £91m charge in respect of Share in Success (see note 7)

Of the profits from property disposals during the year £74m (2006 Enil) arose from the disposal of a property group The disposal group
consisted of both property related assets and liabilities This disposal was structured as a sale and part leaseback, with related proceeds
of £71m received during the year (see Cash Flow section)

Net Finance Income

Net finance income of £6m {2006 £1m costs) comprises interest earned on investments of £56m {2006 £48m) and other interest
receivable of £6m (2006 £3m), offset by interest payable on DTI borrowings of £50m (2006 £48m) and other interest payable of £6m
(2006 £4m) Interest payable on OT! borrowings increased by £2m due to higher average borrowing votumes to support our Post
Office® network and higher average borrowing rates

Net pensions interest
Net pensions interest of £199m {2006 £101m) a non-cash item for the Group has increased by £98m mainly due to an increase in
equity values during 2005-06

Taxation

The taxation charge of £27m (reported rate 9%) comprises £45m current tax payable with respect to UK operations, a £31m current tax
charge on overseas profits a UK deferred tax credit of £59m and an overseas deferred tax charge of £10m Last year a credit of £83m.
was recorded comprising £11m current tax charge with respect to UK operations, a £25m current tax charge on overseas profits a
£112m UK deferred tax credit and a £7m overseas deferred tax credit The low reported rate 1s mainly due to the mcreased amount of
deferred tax asset recognised

The Group operates a central Treasury function that manages some £1bn of financial asset investments (substantially all of which are
now held i escrow in favour of the pension fund trustees) £1 2bn of cash and cash equivatent investments (inctucing £768m cash in the
Post Office® network funded mamly by a Government loan facility) and £811m of financial liabilities, in accordance with investment
Testrictions set by the Government It also acts as internal banker for the Groups business units The Group finances its operations largely
through cash generated from its operations and borrowings

Group Treasury derives its authority from the Royal Mail Holdings plc Board and provides quarterly monitoring reports for their review
The Treasury function only has the authonty to undertake financial transactions relating to the management of the underlying business
risks, it does not engage in speculative transactions and does not operate as a profit centre All strategies are risk averse and the treasury
policy has remained unchanged during the year The principal financial mstruments are deposits and long and short term borrowings

The Royal Mail Group Ltd undrawn facilities of £4 200m in total were agreed shortly before year end and replace the previous facility of

The principal treasury risks arising from the Groups actwities are currency counterparty commodity (fuel) and liquidity nsk These are
managed as follows

» the Group 1s exposed to foreign currency risk due to trading with overseas postal operators for carrying UK mail abroad and
delivering foreign origin mail in the UK, revaluation of the currency balances held to operate the Bureau de Change services

comprising of US Dollar (USS), Japanese Yen Sterling and euro The Group has a policy of matching receipts and payments for
individual currencies where possible and then hedging any material net expasure The policy is that up to 80% of the forecast
net exposure Is hedged with agreement of the internal business unit Group Treasury operates a rolling 18-month programme,
which is subsequently reviewed on a quarterly basis There has been no external hedge mn place throughout the financial year
2006-07 due to there being no material net exposure

100% depending upon the reliability of the forecast of the underlying cash flows

= the Group does not hedge the translation exposure created by the net assets of its overseas subsidianes

+ the Group 1s exposed to fuel risk arising from operating one of the largest vehicle fleets m Europe and a jet fuel risk from the
purchasing of air freight services The Group's fuel risk management strategy aims to reduce uncertainty created by the
movements in the oil and foreign currency markets The strategy operates within the parameters set by the Board which atlow

Business Environment

Regulation

Until the last few years Royal Mail had a monopoly status in the UK letters industry However in 2000 the Postal Serwces Act created an
independent postal Regulator - Postcomm - and allowed Royal Mail to have greater commercial freedom Postcomm regulates the prices
of nearly 90% of Royal Mails tetters business controls the terms and conditions for nearly all sts services sets the quality of service
targets and determines compensation arrangements

Post Office Limited 1s mereasingly subject to regulation in financial services (Financiat Services Authority) and in telephony (Ofcom) Post
Office Limited 1s an appointed representative of Bnstol & West plc which in turn is regulated directly by the Financiat Services Authority

Its the Groups policy to be fully compliant with the regulatory framework in which we operate During 2006-07 we continued to

Competition

The Group s business units now all operate i a competitive marketplace Parcelforce Worldwide and GLS have been operating in an open
market since their inception These units have demonstrated their ability to perform m a non-regulated and competitive environment
which 1s reflected in their annual results

Post Office Limited due to a reduction in income from benefit payments and a significant and continuing decrease in Government use,
has developed revenue streams from finanaal services products (including car msurance a ‘two-in-one credit card and personal loans)
and its HomePhone and directory enquiries services These products are in direct competition with services offered by banks insurance
and telephony companies as are many of the services it has traditionally offered eg bill payments renewal of car tax discs and travel
services

Royal Mail s operating environment has gradually been opened up to competition since February 2004 with the letters market fully
liberalised in January 2006 well in advance of the rest of Europe Competitors are now able to offer customers the opportunity of end-
to-end service for the collection sorting and delivery of their mail

Operating and Financial Review (continued)

Mayor Regulatory Activity in 2006-07
In November 2006 the Group responded to Postcomm s Strategy Review and believes that four key regulatory principles need to be
addressed which will result in a truly competitive industry whereby all stakeholders benefit

‘+ Realign prices to underlying costs - to create transparency for business customers and to ensure that competition ts
sustamable Some competitors in the UK are basing their entry strategres on unsustainable business models which target the
historical cross-subsidies in Royal Mails pricing structure but cross subsidies are fundamentally incompatible with an effectively
functioning competitive market. Postcomm should allow Royal Mail to remove these cross-subsidies so that customers face the
right pricing signals and competitor models going forward are based on effictency,

+ Anarrower range of universal service products - focused on the needs of all social customers and fully funded through stamp
prices Business customers tell us they do not need the protection that the Universal Service Obligation (USO) provides -
Postcomm describes many of these customers as “non-captive” and we agree given the ample choice they have across mail
and other communications providers The USO should therefore be refocused on stamped mail only and prices should reflect
the true costs of this provision

Full retail deregulation of business products - the explosion in access competition, expected to represent 40% of bulk mail next
year 1s encouraging business customers to demand more commercial and innovative responses from Royal Mail However
Royal Mail is prevented from responding rapidly by regulatory requirements such as an involved process for changing terms
and conditions Royal Mail envisages a near term future in which the intense competition in the business mail market replaces.
the need for regulation, and

* Continued operational integration of the postal network - we have put in place measures to ensure that competitors and
customers have access to our network on fair and reasonable terms Separation of the postal network would create confusion
for customers introduce complex and costly interfaces, endanger quality of service and put at risk delivery of the
transformation programme

In March 2007 Postcomm commenced an Interim Price Control Review and intend to make a final decision by November 2007 Royal
Mail has asked Postcomm to consider the following pricing proposals in this review alll of which are consistent with realigning prices to
costs and entirely driven by the need to react to both the volume erosion and significant downtrading that has been evident for the last.
eighteen months

* Reducing the difference between Downstream Access (DSA) and the equivalent retail prices from a high level set to encourage
competition to a level which reflects the underlying upstream costs because entry has been significantly higher than the Price
Control assumptions,

* Allowing Royal Mails retail business to price its non-USO bulk mail products by zone, thereby making prices of cheap to deliver
areas lower by up to 5% and prices of expensive to deliver areas higher by up to 5% This does not change the pice of the “one
price goes anywhere” stamp, and

‘+ Allowing Royal Mail to further rebalance its prices so that it has the flexibility it needs to keep up with the pace of change in the
postal sector

Corporate Social Responsibility

Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) 1s a key component in supporting the business to be recognised as a responsible organisation that
seeks to optimise the beneficial impacts mherent in our business and reduce the negative impacts Through improving our CSR

key Relationships
The Group has several key relationships that are cntical to its day-to-day actiwities and its overall success

People - Our people are the lifeblood of the organisation and brands Without their continued support and dedication it will be impossible
to function on a day-to-day basis and embrace the change within our markets Training diversity flexible resourcing and making the
business a great place to work are some of the ways we continue to improve this relationship

Unions - The Communications Workers Union (CWU) represents non-managenial staff with the Communication Managers Association
(CMA) representing managenal staff The Groups policy 1s to work with the CWU and CMA to engage staff in the development and
execution of business decisions

Pension trustees ~ Our pension trustee board for the main pension plan comprises an independent chairman plus 10 people including
employees union representatives penstoners and independent members The trustee board 1s under review following the introduction of
the member-nominated trustee regulations They take external professional advice from Sacker & Partners LLP (legal) Watson Wyatt
Limited {actuary) and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (financial) They are responsible for full and interim valuations and for reaching
agreement with Royal Mail on appropriate funding for the pension schemes There is a separate trustee board for the sentor executives
pension pian which ts made up of 5 individuals which inciude employees pensioners and an independent member This board 1s also
under review following the introduction of the member-nommated trustee regulations

Customers - The Group's businesses and brands are used or recognised by almost everyone in the UK - from the largest of companies to
Individuals However the 30 largest customers generate 16% of Royal Mails turnover and consequently the business ts reliant on a small
customer base As competition increases the Group will have to continue to simplify ways of doing business and design products around
customers needs Customers are offered standard terms and conditions for the markets and countries in which the Group operate

Subpostmasters - The vast majority of Post Office Limited s 14 219 Post Office® branches are operated by subpostmasters and
franchise partners The National Federation of Subpostmasters (NFSP) represents the interests of all subpostmasters and currently has a
membership of 10 020 Post Office Limuted conducts annual remuneration negotiations with the NFSP and works closely with them to
support a viable network The NFSP 's separately an active body tobbying Government regulators and consumer bodies

‘There are several major retailers who are also significant partners operating between them around 2 400 branches across the country
Post Office Limited liaises closely with these companies to maintain successful working relationships It is through effective partnership
with these various organisations that the business takes into account the interests of agents and seeks to support the achievement of
their sales potential and longer term network viability

Suppliers - The Group has a wide range of supplrers, with its primary reliance on those relating to outsourcing of non-core services such
as IT support It works in partnership with its suppliers to ensure the right products and services are delivered at the mght time at
competitive costs A central purchasing team monitor compliance to Group policy in awarding contracts or new business and adheres to
agreed credit terms

The consumer body Postwatch - Postwatch’s role is to act as a consumer advocate in postal matters Its public views on the effect of
Royal Mails policies and management actions on customers can have an adverse impact on Royal Mails reputation regardless of the
quality of service achieved

The Regulator Postcomm - Nearly 90% of Royal Mail letters’ revenues are price-controlled and the Price Control is set periodically by

Postcomm in the form of a cap on the average price of a basket of products The price creases or reductions allowed by Postcomm

through the Price Control have a very material impact on the likely levels of cash flow the Company can generate Postcomm also

investigates compliance with licence conditions and has broad powers to publicly repnmand or fine Royal Mail if it finds tt in breach of

those conditions :

Shareholder - The Company is a plc that is 100% owned by the Government. The Shareholder Executive (within the Department of Trade
and Industry) manages the shareholder relationship with the Company as a commercial shareholder While management of the Group
therefore lies with the Company's Board of Directors the Shareholder 1s kept up-to-date through quarterly performance reviews and 1s
asked annually to approve the Group's business plan Any new funding required by the Group (apart from short term borrowings of less
than one year) can only be approved by Government if it meets commercial pnnaiptes

of the switch to OSA was a dilution of £71m Other switches to lower price products further reduced revenue by £84m The 2006 results
include the mpact of the general election and European elections which generated £27m in revenue

The decrease in revenue contributed to an operating profit decline of £150m (43 6%) to £194m This profit decline was primarily driven
by increased pension costs (up £164m) and an increase in the level of expenditure on strategic nitatives, aimed at creating a more
modern and efficient operation The level of operational efficiency savings delivered in the year has more than offset inflation impacting on

Principal Risks and Uncertainties

The Group uses a business-wide framework for the identification assessment, treatment monitoring and reporting of sk The process
helps support the business objectives by linking into business strategy identifying and reacting to emerging risks, developing cost effective
solutions to risk

The following Group-level sks have been identified and are beng managed to support the fong-term sustamability of the Group The
impact of some of these risks could be impairment to the value of the Groups brands - Royal Mail Post Office® and Parcelforce
Worldwide which are some of the most well known and trusted brands in the UK and major intangible assets of the Group

The Government is the Company's only shareholder and the Group may be affected by any future change in Government policy
The influence of public policy considerations on Government may adversely affect the Group's ability to promote an effectwe business
strategy This is particularly significant for Post Office Limited that 1s required to run its branch network as a commercial business

Subject to EC approval the Government has agreed a support package for the social branch network If Government faited to deliver this,
support package this may have a prejudicial effect on Post Office Limited's ability to run an efficient and profitable retail network

Group revenues and profit are subject to several uncertainties

The postal market is rapidly evolving as a result of bberalisation Competitors are being increasingly aggressive and target our business
customers where Royal Mail derives most of its profit Additionally business customers may “downtrade” and use less profitable products
The loss of key business customers is exacerbated by the Universal Service Obligation (USO) The USO obliges Royal Mail to maintain a
national collection and delivery network and consequently incur fixed costs which our competitors do not have to bear

There 1s also uncertainty as to how the licence and regulatory regime will affect Royal Mail in the future Unless the regulatory restraints
are changed to permit Royal Mail to recover from the imbalance of business mai! subsidising stamped mail there 1s a nisk that Royal Mail
will always lose money on stamped mail whilst its competitors cream-off more profitable business mail without the requirements of a
USO The USO does however ensure that Royal Mail has the largest distribution network in the country - which may present future
‘opportunities:

Operating and Financial Review (contmued)

The Group ts subject to regulatory restrictions on its operations and the risk of penalties for non-compliance
Royal Mails postal operator s licence contains material restrictions on the operation of the business These include

* Obligations over the delivery and collection of mail
‘© Restrictions over the freedom to set prices, and
* Obligations to give competitors access to its network

tn addition to its postal operators licence the Group 1s also subject to oversight by ather regulators This affects Post Office Limited which
as an appointed representative of Bristol & West plc who are authorised and regulated by the FSA has to satisfy the FSA that it 1s
meeting the relevant regulatory requirements It is also subject to anti-money laundering regulations issued under the Proceeds of Crime
Act 2002 and enforced by HM Revenue and Customs Post Office Limited 1s also licensed as a telephone service provider by Ofcom Ofcom
requires service providers to issue and adhere to Codes of Practice If Royal Mail breaches certain licence conditions and its regulatory
requirements it may be subject to financial penalties

The financial restructuring package agreed with the Government needs to be managed effectively

‘The business has agreed a financial restructunng package that will allow it to restructure the business, invest in new equipment and
address the pension fund deficit that has a major impact on Group profit and the balance sheet. The effective management of the
restructuring package 1s crucial in light of the major challenges that the business faces in terms of the impact of competition pricing and
regulation capital investment and fluctuations in equity markets adversely affecting the pension fund deficit Unless the business remains
vathin the agreed financial restructuring parameters, sanctions or penalties could ensue

Without a continued change of culture within the organisation future development may be impeded
‘The business has undergone, and will continue to undergo a significant amount of change Additionally the changing and uncertain postal
market place the impact of competition and regulation and increased customer expectations place major challenges on all employees to
adapt and improve productivity to levels that will allow the business to compete effectively

These challenges need to be met by ongoing cultural change within the organisation Without a flewble efficient and cooperative culture
Royal Mail could become loss-making as mail volumes decline and labour rates increase Significant ndustrial action could have a major
detrimental effect on the Group s reputation and profits

If the UK's economy slows or goes into recession it ts likely to have a detrimental impact on the Group's profits

Ongoing changes in the global economy pose challenges and opportunities for the UK and all advanced economies Historically there has
been a correlation between the state of the UK economy and level of maits revenue If the economy weakens or goes into recession this
vall have a direct impact on mail volumes and consequently on Group profit

The increasing substitution by alternatives could lead to declining profitability and volumes, which would have an adverse
impact on profit

Delivering business mail for major customers is a vital part of our business Technologies can be used to send information or make
information available faster and, in many cases at a lower cost than traditional mail services If substitution continues mails volumes will
decrease resulting in an associated fall in profit.

Ineffective investment in the operational network could affect productivity levels and our ability to compete effectively

The business 1s about to embark on a major investment programme to replace equipment and technology that 1s nearing the end of its
life cycle The mvestment programme needs to be effectively deptoyed and ongoing investment in the Group s operational network in
future years secured to ensure the Groups ability to compete effectively in the open market

The Group's business activities are time critical and if key infrastructure facilities were disrupted it could have an impact on
results

The business 1s subject to a number of operational risks to its nationwide delivery and retail outlet networks that are largely outside its
control including natural disasters fire flood explosion, possibility of work stoppages or civil unrest transport infrastructure disruption
power failures unavailability of key supplies breakdown or failure of equipment health pandemics terrorism and the normal hazards
associated with running a complex infrastructure A mayor disruption cauld have an adverse impact on business and operating results

The Group is a major energy consumer and may be affected by future environmental and fiscal measures

‘The Group operates a large vehicle fleet and a substantial property portfolio that consume large amounts of energy Although the Group
4s disposing of surplus property and 1s deploying a Carbon Management Programme it may be affected by future environmental measures
and adverse fiscal impact from increased taxation

The Group operates a substantial treasury operation and is exposed to foreign currency risk and fuel price risk

The Group ts exposed to foreign currency risk and fuel price risk. The former 1s due to trading with overseas postal operators for carrying

UK mail abroad and delivering foreign origin mail in the UK the batances held to operate the Bureau de Change services and various sales
and purchase contracts denominated in foreign currency The fuel price nsk arises from operating a large vehicle fleet and an aviation fuel
nisk from purchasing air freight services If the treasury strategy is appropriate to cover the Groups exposures this could result in funds
not being readily available when required or having a negative impact on profit due to increased costs

Way forward

The Group has expenenced a difficult trading year with revenues continuing to fall below expectations in core markets and with profits
declining for the first ume in five years Our operating profit has reduced to £233m compared to £355m last year The combined impacts
of additional pensions charges falling volumes and the effects of competition have squeezed margins in Royal Mail Post Office Limited's
losses have reduced to £99m from £111m but the inclusion of £75m of Social Network Payment within operating profits for 2006-07
masks an underlying worsening a consequence of further losses in traditional mcome from Government not being fully offset by new
commercial product revenues There is better news in our non-regulated parcels businesses where both GLS and Parcelforce Worldwide
continue to improve their revenue and profit performance year on year

On 14 December 2006 the Government announced a long-term funding arrangement for Post Office Lirnited with the final contracts
agreed in May 2007 Certain elements of this package remain subject to State Aid approval This package will enable the reshaping of the
network and ultimately allow the business to deliver a significantly improved performance

On 8 February 2007 the Group announced that it would consult on the future of tts defined benefit pension scheme A series of proposals
has been outlined recently and consultation with our people ts to commence shortly It is anticipated that any changes to be made will
help the Company to ensure it can continue to provide attractive pension benefits for employees

These payments are consistent with the policy of the Remuneration Committee The following sections describe the constitution of the
Committee, its general policy and the main constituents of remuneration

The Remuneration Committee

The Board retains averall accountability for the framework and costs of executive remuneration and the terms of the service contracts
offered to all Executive Directors, which require the consent of the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry The Secretary of State also
gives consent for the remuneration arrangements for Non Executive Directors The Remuneration Committees role is to develop the
remuneration policy for Executive Directors and their immediate reports and specifically to make recommendations on their salary
benefits bonuses and other terms and conditions of employment The Committee also recommends appropriate compensation on the
cessation of employment giving careful consideration to what compensation should be paid taking mto account the circumstances of the
particular case and the ability of the mdividual to mitigate

The Remuneration Committee is made up wholly of independent Non Executive Directors Membership of the Commuttee 1s disclosed on
page 34 The Chief Executive Adam Crozier, and the Director People & Organisational Development Tony McCarthy may attend these
meetings by invitation but are not present at the discussion of their own remuneration

Advice to the Remuneration Committee
The Committee calls for mformation and advice from inside and outside the Group It takes advice from those independent professional
organisations that are best able to assist its consideration of the particular topics under discussion

During 2006-07 advice on the performance of key executives was given by the Charman ang the Chief Executive Information on the
external marketplace was given by Monks Partnership (a trading name of PriceWaterhouse Coopers) Deloitte & Touche LLP and Watson
Wyatt Limited Internal support 1s primarily provided by the Director People & Organisational Development Tony McCarthy, and from the
Company Secretary, Jonathan Evans Other advice and information has been provided by specialists from People & Organisational
Development and Finance

Ouring the year advice was given to the Company by Watson Wyatt Limited on pension and actuarial matters

Remuneration policy
The Company s policy on Directors remuneration is that

the overall remuneration package should be sufficiently competitive to attract and retain executives of the necessary quality na
complex business and a competitive market place who will deliver success for the Shareholder and high levels of customer
service safety and environmental performance

* a significant proportion of the remuneration package should be dependent on performance in both the short and the long-term
and

the system of remuneration should establish an identity of mterest between senior executives customers and the Shareholder
The policy for senior executives takes into account pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group

The Committee regularly reviews the structure of the package and its competitrveness agamst appropnate marketplaces The Committee
aims to ensure that the package Is proportionate and effective, and that it 1s developed in accordance with accepted best practice

The main components of remuneration
The main components for Executive Directors are basic salary an annual performance-related bonus, a Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
pension and other benefits The Committee believes that there should be a continuing emphasis an those elements of remuneration that

are performance-related

Base salaries

The Committee believes that base salaries should be set at levels that are sufficient to recruit and retain high calibre executives. In making
Its yudgement the Commuttee 1s informed by a vanety of data aimed at making a fair comparison with enterprises of a similar size and
complexity to Royal Mail This data is provided by independent consultancies Increases are recommended where the Committee believes
that it ts necessary to reflect contribution increased individual responsibilities and market levels The Secretary of States consent 1s
required for atl material changes to Directors’ remuneration

Last year the increase applied was 2.9% which was below the market movement for jobs of this size but m line wath increases applied
elsewhere in the Company It has been decided that for 2007-08 the increase in base salaries for Executive Directors will be zero

Performance-retated, personal annual bonus 2006-07
For 2006-07 the annual bonus plan followed the model of the previous year except that
* all Business roles had a weighting of 30% on Group Performance and 70% Business This applied to the Managing Directors of
Letters and Post Office Limited and
* all Group roles had an additional 10% weighting gwen to Post Office Limited s performance in view of the importance of
supporting the recovery of that business This applied to all Executive Directors except for the Managing Oirectors of Letters
and Post Office Limited

The following tables show the make up of the annual bonus plan as percentages of annual salary

Maximum levels Profit Service Quality Total

In addition Post Office Limited has a measure of new products sold

Long-Term Incentive Plans
Last year it was noted that a Long-Term Incentive Plan with similar characteristics to the previous one was beng discussed with
Government

After the discussion of various options a three year LTIP ts in place for 2005-06 to 2007-08 A further three year LTIP for the period
2007-08 to 2009-10 will be put in place This arrangement will allow the last plan to come to an end at the same time as the next
PostComm review

Performance is measured by Return on Total Assets
For the three years 2005-06 to 2007-08 the principles of the plan are as follows

{a) Annuat Company Performance Awards which accrue on a sliding scale above a threshold level of performance and begin at 12 5% of
annual base salary For on-target performance, the Company Award ts 25% of annual base salary and for exceptional performance this
rose in accordance with a stepped scale to a maximum of 37 5% For 2007-08 the potential awards are half of these -1e they would
begin at 6 25% of annual base salary with 12 5% for on-target performance and 18 75% for exceptional performance
RMG00000310
RMG00000310

Royal Mail Holdings plc

Directors’ Remuneration Report (continued)

(b) Bonus Awards A Bonus Award can be made each year by the Remuneration Commuttee These are only made in situations where the
Director waives a proportion of their annual bonus and do not exceed the amount waived A Director has the discretion to waive a
maximum of one half of any annual bonus up to the on-target level Any decision to waive must be taken in the first quarter of the
relevant year If a bonus above on-target would otherwise be payable then three quarters of this additional amount will be compulsorily
waived For 2007-08, the Bonus Award would be one half of the normal level If a proportion of annual bonus 1s waived then a Bonus
Award may be made within the LTIP not exceeding that value

(c) A Multiplying factor Company Awards may be increased by a factor which measures Return on Total Assets across the plan If the on-
target level 1s achieved for the relevant period then each of the Company Awards to which it applies may be increased by an additional
one third In the case of exceptional performance then up to a maximum addition of 100% can be added

Payments under the plan will be made m June 2008

The 2007-08 to 2009-10 LTIP will have the same principles as the previous LTIP, with 2007-08 also counting for one half of the normal
amount in that plan Any Company and Bonus Awards for 2007-08 are effectively shared equally between the two plans

The performance targets for the 2007-08 to 2009-10 plan are still under discussion with the Government
The proposals are being structured such that.
~ three year plans could be used while aligning the maturity of the second plan with the next PostComm review and

~ there 1s a connection between the two plans through the common year with one half of the 2007-08 bonus award being carried
forward ‘

Company Awards

These are measured against an annual Return On Total operating Assets target (ROTA) ROTA incentivises the productive value of the 0
business and emphasises the need to make efficient use of all operational assets It covers the need to make a proper return both on any

new investments that are made and on the existing asset base

For 2005-06 the ROTA target was 11 2% and the Companys achievernent was 13 7% 22% above the target and above the proposed
stretch of 13 4% This resulted m Company Awards of 37 5%

For 2006-07 the following table against annual ROTA applied

Royal Mail ROTA achievement Percentage of Base Salary
Below 38% Nil

38-41% 125%

42-67% 250%

48-53% 275%
54-71% pro-rata 300% to 375%

7.1% and above 375%

The outturn was 5 4% but the Committee made an award of 25% of base salary for 2006-07

Bonus Awards

As descnbed above a Director may waive a maximum of one half of any annual bonus up to the on-target level and must waive three
quarters of any bonus earned above the on-target level If a proportion of annual bonus is waived then a Bonus Award may be made
within the LTIP, not exceeding that value

Multiplying Factor

The Multiplying Factor 1s dependent upon cumulatwe ROTA over 2005-06 to 2007-08

The cumulative ROTA works as follows Targets for the end of the third year are 15 9% at the threshold level 17 4% at the on-target level
and 25 7% at the maximum To ensure consistency of performance there are intermediate targets at March 2007 of 13 6% at the
threshold level 15 1% at the on-target level and 20 33 at the maximum If the on-target level of cumulative ROTA 1s exceeded at the end
of March 2007 the percentage multiplier at that position on the performance scale 1s applied to the awards made so far and the final
outcome 1s applied to the awards made in the last year only and in this case 1s subject to Remunerauon Committee discretion

Notes to the Group accounts

1 Authorisation of financial statements and statement of compliance with IFRSs

The Group s finanaal statements for the year ended 25 March 2007 were authonsed for issue by the Board on 26 October 2007 and the
balance sheet was signed on the Boards behalf by Adam Crozier and lan Duncan

The Group s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the
European Union and as they apply to the financial statements of the Group for the year ended 25 March 2007 The principal accounting
policies adopted by the Group are set out in note 2

2 Accounting policies

Basis of preparation and accounting

The Group compnses Royal Mait Holdings ptc (the Company) - which is wholly owned by HM Government - and its subsidiaries The Company
1s incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 1985 (the Act) and the accounts are produced im accordance with the Act and
applicable International Financial Reporting Standards {IFRSs)

On 20 March 2007 Royal Mail Group ple a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company had its name changed to Royal Mail Group Ltd following
an agreement between the Company and its Shareholder on a new funding package (see below) All previous references to Royal Mail Group
plc {including comparative information) have been changed to reflect the name change to Royal Mail Group Ltd

The Group finanaal statements are presented in sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest £m except where otherwise indicated

Royal Mail Group Ltd a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, 1s exposed to the risk of being fined by its mdustry Regulator and of being
required to pay compensation to certain customers as a result of failing to meet operational targets set by the Regulator in sts licence The
amount of such fines and compensation witl be determined by the Regulator after further representations from Royal Mail Group Ltd and no
further information is being disclosed on the grounds that it can be expected to prejudice the outcome of that process

Key sources of estimation uncertainty

The key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of causing material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities within the next financial year relate to the measurement of the defined benefit pension obligations and deferred tax Measurement of
these defined benefit obligations requires certain assumptions to be made including on life expectancy future changes in salaries, inflation and
a suitable discount rate The size of these obligations, and therefore the pension deficit 1s materially sensitive to the assumptions adopted The
major assumptions are disclosed in note 25 Assessment of the deferred tax asset requires an estimation of future profitability Such
estimation Is inherently uncertain in a market subject to various competitive pressures Should estimates of future profitability change in future
years the arnount of deferred tax recognised will also change accordingly

Funding

Royal Mail Group Ltd

Royal Mail Group Ltd Is profitable even after bearing tosses relating to stamped mail and carrying out its Universal Service Obligations but it
now faces considerable cash requirements with respect to its proposed mvestment in plant and equipment and funding its pension deficit at a
‘tume when the market has been opened up to full competition

On 23 March 2007 the Company completed an agreement with its Shareholder for a new funding package which will enable the
transformation of Royal Mail Group Ltd to take place and has enabled the establishment of investments in escrow of €1bn provided as security
to the Royal Mail Pension Plan in support of the 17 year deficit recovery period from March 2006

‘The European Commisston has launched an investigation under the EC Treaty’s rules on state aid into a series of funding measures taken by
the United Kingdom Government in its capacity as Shareholder in favour of Royal Mail between 2001 and 2007 including the recent funding
package In its response to the EC in relation to this investigation the United Kingdom Government has stated that it believes that the measures
being investigated by the EC were concluded on commercial terms

Post Office Limited
Post Office Limited had net liabilities as at 25 March 2007 and as explained i the Operating and Financial Review has operated at a loss
during 2006-07 and prior years, primarily because of supporting the loss-making rural network.

To become wable in the longer term new business areas continue to be developed to replace the lost contribution fram traditional income
sources and significant cost reduction programmes continue to be implemented

During the year Post Office Limited has updated its five-year strategic plan and its future financing ts underpmned by

* rural network funding of £75m recewed as a Government grant in the second half of 2006-07 in addition to the £75m received during
2006-07 fram Royal Mail Group Ltd (its immediate parent company) and £150m received on 2 April 2007 for 2007-08 State ard
approval for these payments was recewved in February 2006

= short-term funding of £234m received in the second half of 2006-07 to meet the ongoing cash requirements of Post Office Limited
State aid approval for this funding was recewed in May 2003, and

* a funding agreement with Government announced on 17 May 2007 which provides, amongst other matters, for a payment from
Government by 31 July 2007 of £313m to compensate Post Office Limited for the other net costs of providing certain specified “services
of general economuc interest” State aid approval for that payment of £313m was received in March 2007

Royal Mail Holdings plc

2 Accounting policies (contmued)
The funding agreement addresses the following areas all of which are subject to state aid approval

* the extension to March 2016 of the esting working caputal facility of £1 15bn

* providing network substdy payments of around £150m per annum in each of the three financial years 2008-09 to 2010-11 for the
purposes of meeting up to a specified limit the net costs of maintaining certain foss-making parts of the network and

* the prowsion of funding to compensate Post Office Limited for the other net costs of providing certam specified “services of general
economic interest”

After careful consideration and having regard among other factors, to the Government funding package and the requirement to obtain state
aid approval for certain elements of this package the Directors believe that Post Office Limited will be able to meet tts liabilities as they fall due
over the foreseeable future

Conclusion

Royal Mail Holdings plc

2. Accounting policies (continued)

Operating exceptional items

Operating exceptional items are material items of income and expenditure arising from the operations of the business which, due to the nature
of the events giving nse to them, require separate presentation on the face of the income statement to allow a better understanding of
financial performance in the year in companion to prior years

Operating profit
Operating profit 1s the profit arising from the normal recurring operations of the business and after charging operating exceptional iterns
defined above It excludes the non operating exceptional items for profit or loss an disposal of businesses and profit or loss on disposal of
property plant and equipment These items are not part of the normal recurring operations of the business but are matenal, so are presented
‘separately on the face of the income statement to allow a better understanding of financial performance in the year in comparison to prior
years

Goodwill

Business combinations on or after 29 March 2004 are accounted for under IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ using the purchase method Any
excess of the cost of the business combination over the Group s interest im the net fair value of the identifiable assets liabilities and contingent
hhabitities at the date of acquisition is recognised in the balance sheet as goodwill and is not amortised

After initial recognition goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment tosses Goodwill arising from business combinations 1s
reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired

An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset (or cash generating unit)
exceeds its recoverable amount which is the higher of an asset s net realisable value and its value in use

For the purpose of such impairment reviews goodwill ts allocated to the relevant cash generating units

Goodwill arising on the acquisition of equity accounted entities 1s included i the cost of those entities and therefore not reported in the balance
sheet as goodwill

Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination are capitalised separately from goodwill if the fair value can be measured retiably
on initial recognition Intangible assets acquired separately or development costs that meet the criteria to be capitalised are initially recognised
at cost and are assessed to have either a finite or indefinite useful life Those with a finite life are amortised over their useful life and those with
an indefinite life are reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying

value may be impaired An impairment loss 1s recognised in the income statement for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset
exceeds its recoverable amount which is the higher of an assets net realisable value and its vatue in use

Amortisation of intangible assets with finite lives is charged annually to the income statement The useful lives of such intangible assets are in
the range of 1-6 years:

Research and development
Expenditure on research 1s written off in the year it is incurred Development costs are capitalised where they meet the critena required under
IFRSs If these cnteria are not met then the costs are recognised in the income statement as they are incurred

Property, plant and equipment

Property plant and equipment is recognised at cost. including attributable costs in bringing the asset into working condition for its intended 1
use Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is provided on a straight-line basis by reference to net book value and to the remaming I
useful economic lives of assets and their estimated residual values The useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually and adjustments.

where applicable are made on a prospective hasis The lives assigned to major categones of property plant and equipment are I

Range of asset lives

Land and buildings

Freehold land Not depreciated

Freehold buildings Up to 50 years

Leasehold buildings The shorter of the penod of the lease 50 years or the estimated remaiing useful fe
Plant and machinery 3-15 years
Motor vehicles and trailers 1-12 years
Futures and equipment 2-15 years

An individual property that the Group has identified as surplus is reclassified as non-current assets held for sale a separate category on the

balance sheet when a sale is highly probable This has been determined to be when authority to market the property has been approved and

the property is vacant and therefore available for immediate sale and occupation by a third party Such properties are expected to generate ;
economic cash flow primarily by sale of the asset rather than by operational activites and are expected generally to be disposed of within a ‘
year

For a disposal group of properties or other assets and liabilities the requirements of iFRS 5 ‘Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued
‘operations’ are applied to the specific circumstances of the disposal group

Impairment reviews 2
Unless otherwise disclosed in these accounting policies assets are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying value may be impaired The Group assesses at each reporting date whether such indications exist Where appropriate an
impairment loss ts recognised in the income statement for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset (or cash generating unit)
exceeds its recoverable ammount, which ts the higher of an asset's net realisable value and its value in use

2 Accounting policies (continued)

Leases

Finance leases where substantially all the sks and rewards incidental to ownership of the leased item have passed to the Group are
capitalised at the inception of the lease with a corresponding liability recognised for the fair value of the leased item or if ower at the present
value of the minumum lease payments Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of the lease liability to
achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaiing balance of the tiability Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the
estimated useful life of the asset and the lease term

Leases where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases and
rentals are charged to the income statement aver the lease term The aggregate benefit of incentives are recognised as a reduction of rental
expenses over the lease term on a straight-line basis

Inventories
Inventories are carned at the lower of cost and net realisable value after adjusting for obsolete or slow-moving stock Cost mcludes all costs in
bringing each item to its present location and condition and comprises weighted average cost for supplies and matenals and purchase cost for
merchandise

Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables are recognised and carried at original mvoice amount {ess an allowance for any non-collectable amounts An estimate for
doubtful debts 1s made when collection of the full amount 1s no longer probable Bad debts are written off when identified

Cash and cash equivatents

Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet compnse cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an orginal maturity date of
three months or less In addition the Group uses Money Market funds as a readily available source of cash, which are bought and sold on a
daily basis to meet the cash requirements of the business These funds are also categonsed as cash equivalents

For the purpose of the cash flow statement. cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above net of bank
overdrafts

Financial assets - mvestments

Financial assets within the scope of IAS 39 Financial Instruments Recognition and Measurement are classified as financial assets at fair value
through the income statement, loans and recervables held to maturity investments, or as available for sale financial assets, as appropriate The
Group determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition and re-evaluates this designation at each financial year end
When financial assets are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value being the transaction price plus 1n the case of financial assets
not at fair value through the income statement any directly attributable transactional costs

The subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on their classification as follows.

Financial assets at fair value through the income statement (held for trading)

Financial assets are classified as held for trading if they are acquired for sale mn the short term Denwvaties are also classified as held for trading
unless they are designated as hedging instruments Assets are carried in the balance sheet at fair value with gains or losses recognised in the
income statement

Held-to-maturity investments

Non-derwative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturity are classified as ‘held to maturity when the Group has
the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity Held to maturity investments are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate
method Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the investments are derecognised or impaired as well as through the
amortisation process Investments intended to be held for an undefined period are not included in this classification

Loans and receivables

Non-derwative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted on an active market do not qualify as trading assets
and have not been designated as either ‘fair value through the imcome statement or avatlable for sale Such assets are carried at amortised
cost using the effective interest rate method if the time value of money is significant Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement
when the foans and receivables are derecognised or impaired as well as through the amortisation process

Avatable for sale financial assets

‘Available for sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are designated as such or are not classified in any of the three
preceding categories After mitial recognition available for sale financial assets are measured at fair value with gains or losses being recognised
aS a separate component of equity until the investment is derecognised or until the mvestment is deemed to be impaired at which time the
cumulative gain or loss previously reported in equity 1s included in the mcome statement.

Interest-bearing loans and borrowings

All loans and borrowings are mitially recognised at the farr value of the consideration recewed less directly attributable issue costs After initial
Tecognition interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method Gains
and losses are recognised in the mcome statement when the liabulities are derecognised or impaired as well as through the amortisation
process

Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense when incurred

2 Accounting policies {contmued)

Derivative financial instruments
The Group uses denvative instruments such as foreign currency contracts in order to manage the risk profile of any underlying risk exposure of
the Group, in line with the Groups treasury management policies Such derivative financial instruments are initially stated at fair value

For the purpose of hedge accounting hedges are classified as cash flow hedges where they hedge exposure to variability in cash flows that 1s
either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecasted transaction

In relation to cash flow hedges to hedge the foreign exchange nsk of firm commitments that meet the conditions for hedge accounting, the
portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to relate to an effective hedge ts recognised directly in equity and the
ineffective portion is recognised in the income statement

‘When the hedged firm commitment results in the recognition of a non financial asset or non financial lability then at the time the asset or
(iability 1s recognised, the associated gains or losses that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of
the acquisition cost or other carrying amount of the asset or liability For all other cash flow hedges the gains or losses that are recognised in
equity are transferred to the income statement in the same year in which the hedged firm commitment affects the net profitNoss for example
when the future sale actually occurs

For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are taken directly to the mcome
statement in the period

Hedge accounting ts discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold terminated or exercised or no longer qualifies for hedge
accounting At that point in time any cumiulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity 1s kept in equity until the forecast
transaction occurs If a hedged transaction 1s no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised im equity 1s transferred to
the mcome statement for the year

Fair value measurement of financial instruments

The fair value of quoted investments 1s determined by reference to bid prices at the close of business on the balance sheet date Where there 1s
no active market fair value 1s determined using valuation techniques These include using recent arms length market transactions, reference to
the current market value of another instrument which is substantially the same and discounted cash flow analysis and pricing models
Specifically in the absence of quoted market prices derivatives are valued by using quoted forward prices for the underlying commodity/currency
and discounted using quoted interest rates {both as at the close of business on the balance sheet date)

For the purposes of disclosing the fair value of investments held at amortised cost in the balance sheet, in the absence of quoted market prices
fair values are calculated by discounting the future cash flows of the financial instrument using quoted equivalent interest rates as at close of
business on the balance sheet date

Derecognition of financial instruments
A financial asset or lability 1s derecognised when the contract that gives nse to it is settled sold cancelled or expires

Income tax and deferred tax
The charge for current taxation is based on the results for the year as adjusted for items that are non-assessable or disallowed It is calculated
using rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the batance sheet date

Deferred tax 1s provided using the lability method on all temporary differences at the balance sheet date, between the tax bases of assets and
lrabilites and their carrying amounts for financiat reporting purposes

Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences except

2 Accounting policies (continued)

Current and deferred tax 1s charged or credited directly to equity if it relates to items that are credited or charged directly to equity Otherwise
itis recognised in the income statement

Provisions

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event its probable that an
outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation If the effect
of the time value of money 1s matenal provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at an appropriate pre-tax rate

Pensions and other post-retirement benefits

Membership of occupational pension schemes is open to most permanent UK employees of the Group All members of defined benefit schemes
are contracted out of the earnings-related part of the State pension scheme Overseas subsidiaries make separate arrangements for the
Provision of pensions and other post-retirement benefits

The pension plans assets for the defined benefit schemes are measured at fair value Liabilities are measured on an actuanal basis using the
projected unit credit method and discounted at a rate equivalent to the current rate of return on a high quality corporate bond of equivalent
currency and term The resulting defined benefit asset or liability is presented separately on the face of the balance sheet Full actuarial
valuations are carried out at intervals not normally exceeding three years as determmed by the Trustees and with appropriate updates and
accounting adjustments at each balance sheet date form the basis of the deficit disclosed

For defined benefit schemes the amounts charged to operating profit are the current service costs and any gains and losses arising from
settlements, curtailments and past service costs The net difference between the interest costs and the expected return on plan assets 1s
recognised as net pensions interest in the mcome statement. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in the statement of
recognised income and expense (SORIE) Any deferred tax movement associated with the actuarial gains and losses ts also recognised in the
SORIE

For defined contribution schemes the Group s contributions are charged to operating profit within people costs in the period to which the
contributions relate

Foreign currencies
The functional and presentational currency of Royal Mail Holdings plc 1s sterling (€) The functional currency of the overseas subsidiaries in
Europe is mainly the euro (€)

The assets and labilities of foreign operations are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date The trading results of
foreign operations are translated at the average rates of exchange for the reporting period being a reasonable approximation to the actual
transaction rate The exchange differences arising on the translation, since the date of transition to IFRSs are taken directly to the foreign
currency translation reserve in equity

Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency by applying the spot exchange rate ruling at the date of the
transaction Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the functional currency rate of exchange
ruling at the balance sheet date Currently hedge accounting 1s nat claimed for any monetary assets and liabilities All differences are therefore
taken to the income statement except for differences on monetary assets and liabilities that form part of the Groups net investment in a
foreign operation These are taken directly to equity until the disposal of the net investment occurs, at which time they are recognised in profit
or loss

Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of histoncal cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates
of the imttal transactions Non-monetary items measured at fair value in foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date
when the fair value is determined

Contingent tiabilitres and financial guarantee contracts
Financial guarantee contracts are inttially measured at fair value and subsequently at the higher of amounts under IAS 37 or the amounts
initially recognised less when appropriate cumulative amortisation recognised in accordance with IAS 18 Revenue

Contingent babilities are not disclosed if the possibility of losses occurring is considered to be remote

has rolled over capital gains of £86m (2006 £83m), no tax liabitity would be expected to crystallise shauld the assets into which the gains have
been rolled be sold at their carrying value as it 1s anticipated that a capital loss would arise

At 25 March 2007, there was no recognised or unrecognised deferred income tax ability (2006 Enil) for taxes that would be payable on the
unremitted earnings of certain of the Groups subsidiaries associates or joint ventures as the Group has no liability to additional taxation should
‘such amounts be remitted due to the availability of double taxatron relief or other exemptions

In his Budget on 21 March 2007 the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced a reduction of 2% in the main rate of corporation tax with effect.
from Aprit 2008 together with changes to the capital allowances regime In accordance with accounting standards the effect of the changes on
deferred tax balances has not been reflected in these accounts due to the relevant legislation not having been substantively enacted at the
balance sheet date The effect of the reduction in the tax rate on the Groups deferred tax asset at the balance sheet date would be to reduce
the recognised amount by £25m and the unrecognised amount by £101m

The carrying value of goodwill arising on business combinations of £143m (2006 £132m) at the balance sheet date includes £142m (2006
£131m) relating to the General Logistics Systems (GLS) business segment In lime with the accounting policy (see note 2) this goodwill has
been reviewed for impairment An impairment loss ts recognised for the amount by which the carrying value of an asset or cash generating
unit exceeds the recoverable amount The recoverable amount is the higher of net realisable value and value in use The carrying value of GLS,
excluding interest bearing and tax related assets and liabilities 1s £322m (2006 £282m) at year end (see note 3) and the operating profit
before exceptional items is £115m (2006 £100m) for the year (see note 3) The carrying value represents a multiple of 2 8 (2006 2 8) on
operating profit before exceptional tems The net reatisable value of GLS for the purposes of the impairment review (ie the ‘fair value less
costs to sell) has been assessed with reference to earnings multiptes for quoted entities in a similar sector On this basis the net realisable
value of GLS has been assessed to be in excess of the carrying value No reasonable possible change in the earnings multiples referenced
would reduce the net realisable vatue to below the carrying value

Foreign currency risk

‘The Group 1s exposed to foreign currency risk due to trading with overseas postal operators for carrying UK matl abroad and delivenng foreign
origin mail in the UK the balances held to operate the Bureau de Change services within Post Office Limited and various sales and purchase
contracts denominated in foreign currency These risks are mitigated by hedging programmes managed by Group Treasury Where possible
exposures are netted internally and any remaining exposure 1s hedged using a combination of external spot and forward contracts Hedging
will not normally be considered for exposures of less than £1m hedging ts normally confined to 80% of the forecast exposure where forecast
cash flows are highly probable

The Groups obligation to settle with overseas postal operators 1s denominated in Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) - a basket of currencies
comprising of US Dollar (US$) Japanese Yen Sterling and euro Group Treasury operates a rolling 18-month hedge programme which 1s
subsequently reviewed on a quarterly basis There has been no external SDR hedge in place throughout the financial year 2006-07 due to
there being no material net exposure

For the Bureau de Change business balances of major currency holdings are hedged along with minor currencies showing a closely correlated
movement.

The Group obligations to settle conveyance charges in USS and euro has been hedged {to April 2007}
The Group's obligations to settle euro invoices on a specfic capital project were hedged This programme matured during the year

Two further hedge programmes have been initiated during the year The Group s obligations to settle euro invoices on two separate capital
projects (IMPS and FLATS) have been hedged (as far forward as February 2009)

The Group does not hedge the translation exposure created by the net assets of its overseas subsidiaries

Commodity price risk

The Group 1s exposed to fuel price risk arising from operating one of the largest vehicle fleets in Europe which consumes over 150 million
litres of fuel per year and a jet fuel price risk arising from the purchasing of air freight services The Groups fuel risk management strategy
aims to reduce uncertainty created by the movements in the oil and foreign currency markets The strategy uses over-the-counter derivative
products (in both USS commodity pnice and USS/Sterling exchange rate) to manage these exposures

In addition, the Group ts exposed to the commodity price nsk of purchasing electricity and gas The Groups risk management strategy ams to
reduce uncertainty created by the movernents in the electricity and gas markets These exposures are managed by locking into fixed rate pnce
contracts with suppliers

Credit risk

Royal Mail operates a Credit Policy which provides a fair and equitable arrangement for all its account customers The level of credit granted is
based on a customer's risk profile assessed by an independent crecit referencing agent The Credit Policy is applied rigidly within the regulated
products area so as to ensure that Royal Mail is not m breach of compliance legislation Assessment of credit for the non-regulated products ts
based on commercial factors which are commensurate with the Groups appetite for risk

Royal Mail has a dedicated credit management team which sets and monitors credit limits and takes corrective action as and when
appropnate Despite alt the controls in place Royat Mail does suffer from bad debts but the level of bad debts incurred 1s below 0 2% of
turnover

With respect to credit risk arising from other financial assets of the Group which comprise cash cash equivalent investments available for sale
financial assets held to maturity financial assets held for trading financial assets loans and receivables financial assets and certain derivative
instruments the Groups exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying
amount of these instruments

There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group apart from a £1bn exposure to the Royal Bank of Scotland as a result of
the establishment of the two pension escrow accounts This exposure is expected to be short-term pending the implementation of a longer
term investment strategy for the accounts

Liquidity risk

The Group s primary objective 1s to ensure that the Group has sufficient funds available to meet its financial obligations as they fall due This 1s
achieved by aligning short-term investments and borrowing facilities with forecast cash flows Typical short-term investments include money
market funds time deposits with approved counterparties UK Government gitts and treasury bills Borrowing facilities are regularly reviewed to
ensure continuity of funding

The unused facilities for Royal Mail Group Ltd were renegotiated dunng the year with the effect that £1 200m expires between 2014 and
2016 (2006 £844m expinng by 2009) The unused facility for Post Office Limited of £850m (2006 £790m) expires in 2010 Additionally the
Group has £300m (2006 £300m) of uncommitted lines of credit which are revewed annually

A charge for the defined contribution schemes of £2m (2006 £2m) was recognised in operating profit before exceptional items within the
income statement The Company contributions to these schemes was £2m (2006 £1m)

Defined Benefit

Both RMPP and RMSEPP are funded by the payment of contributions to separate trustee administered funds The latest full actuarial
valuations of both schemes have been carned out as at 311 March 2006 using the projected unit method For RMPP this valuation has been
concluded at £3 4bn deficit. For RMSEPP, the valuation has been concluded at £43m deficit

Payment of £541m (2006 £342m) was made during the year in respect of regular future service contributions, with £538m (2006 £337m)
relating to RMPP. The regular future service contributions for RMPP expressed as a percentage of pensionable pay has increased from 12 6%

deficit recovery period

The foltowing disclosures relate to the gains/losses and deficit in the schemes recognised for the RMPP and RMSEPP defined benefit plans in
the financial statements of the Group

a) Mayor assumptions

The size of the pension deficit which 1s large in the context of the Group and its finances 1s materially sensitive to the assumptions
adopted Small changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the deficit and overall income statement charge The
mayor assumptions were

At 25 March 2007 At 26 March 2006
upa Spa
Rate of increase m salaries 41 38
Rate of increase in pensions and deferred pensions 31 28
Discount rate $3 49
Inflation assumption 34 28
Expected average rate of return on assets 70 71

The above assumptions relate to both defined benefit plans with the exception of the expected average rate of return on assets which is
computed for the combined assets of the plans The expected average rate of return on assets is a weighted average of the long-term
expected rate of return of each principal asset class (see section b) The expected average rate of return is computed at each balance sheet
date based on the market values and long-term rate of return of each principal asset class as at that date

Mortality

The mortality assumptions for the larger scheme are based on the 1992 series mortality tables allowing for ‘medium cohort projections of future
improvements These are detaled below

Average expected life expectancy from age 60 2007 2006

For a current 60 year old male RMPP member 26 years 26 years
