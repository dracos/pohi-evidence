Subject: FW: Draft Meeting note and letter

Mark, Martin,

We need a quick decision on dates for the Paula MPs meeting. James’ office have come back and asked if we could do
the 17" or the 24". I haven’t checked Paula’s availability for the 24" yet as our preference is to go for the 17® in spite of
the issue with POAC.

A couple of points to note 1) The budget is pre announced for the 19" of March so will likely be the nominate that day,
2}the 24" feels like a long time after second sight are due to issue their report (27 February}.

We need to go back to James’ office today so grateful for quick views.
Thanks

D

David

Might Paula be able to attend a meeting on Monday 24 March at 5.30? The slot on Monday 17 March is now
under threat, but still available if Paula can do, but Ill need to know later today, if possible.

Many thanks

Janet,

Thanks I will come back with some suggested text to address the points James makes below. Did you have any
comments on the draft letter? In terms of a date Paula can’t do the Monday or Tuesday but we can do the Wednesday
12" March 5.45 for one hour.

Also I understand that after the last meeting was called we (Post Office) emailed MPs following the invite to let them
know that we will be at the meeting and to provide them with a contact point for any questions. I understand that this
worked well in July and we would like to do the same if that is ok with you.

Thanks

David

GRO. :

Hi David
Thanks for your patience on this.
With regard to the Minutes, James thinks they are absolutely fine except for a few differences, which he would
like recorded:
1. PV confirmed that Second Sight were at liberty to discuss matters with JA, as was the JFSA
2. PV confirmed that if problems were found with Horizon, that Second Sight were at liberty to investigate
— in other words, there were no ‘no go’ areas in the investigations
3. PV happy to meet with Second Sight to iron out letter of agreement
With regard to the agenda, he proposes the following:

1. Welcome and into — JNA for 5 mins

POL-0099809
POL00100226
POL00100226

2. Update on progress with mediation scheme and business improvement programme — PV for 15 mins.
3. Second Sight update - 10 mins

4. JFSA update ~ 10 mins

5. Q&A ~ 20 mins

Can you let me know your thoughts, please?

Finally, we need to get the date confirmed tomorrow, I’m afraid. Meeting rooms here get booked out months
in advance, and we are only a month away from the proposed date. Can you help out on this, please?

Kind regards,
Janet
