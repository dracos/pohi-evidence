Symptoms

Critical Error reported by Riposte: <br>Text: Invalid node identifie

Problem

This message relates to the Riposte programs node identifier which identifies the counter within that office i.e. node:1 for the gateway node:2
for counter 2 and so on.<br>The Invalid Node Id event is caused by an incoming message arriving from a neighbour and Riposte detecting that
the Node id is invalid (either in the header or the message body). The subsequent event "Network message received from an unknown source”
is likely to refer to the same message. <br> <br>Mark has spoken with Escher regarding this problem. His understanding is that isolated
occurences of this event (that is not once per message receieved from the Correspondece server) are likely to be caused by a bug in Riposte.
Unfortunatley without a reproducible case it is very difficult to progress this problem. His recommendation is that we do not pursue any
attempts to reproduce this problem with Riposte 5.4 (CI3 counter), rather we wait to see if it still happens with Riposte 6 (C14 counter). The
two reasons for this recommendation are: <br>(1) The connection protocol has changed significantly at Riposte 6 and hence<br>so has
maintenance of connection state. Therefore the problem may have been<br>solved .<br>(2) The relatively low frequency of occurence < 10
per day is mostly benign. <br><br>Mark will review the provision of additional diagnostics information in Riposte 6 with Escher to facilitate
diagnosis of problems with connection state.

Solution - Helpdesk

_ These events indicate that a message has been discarded. Advice from Mark Jarosz is that given the small number of messages are being
discarded we should treat this event in the same manner as the "Network message from an unknown source.." that is relatively benign but we
need to solve it should it be seen at Riposte 6 (i.e. Data centre system or Cl4 counter).

Evidence

None required for C13 counters.<br><br>Should this occur on a Data Centre system or Cl4 counter then please raise a call with the SSC and
obtain event logs from the system reporting the error.
