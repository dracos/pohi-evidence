I would like to bring to your attention an issue regarding the postmaster events. We have recently
received invites with very short notice, which is a disappointment on the part of our retail team.
Once again, the team has failed to keep the board up to date and also keep me and me and Elliot
informed about these Postmaster Listening events to ensure PM’s NEDS are present.

To provide some context, a postmaster contacted me on Tuesday 16th and asked about my
attendance at the Postmaster Listening event in Leeds, which I had no knowledge of. As a result, I
inquired about who was organizing the event. Eventually, I received an invite, and the rest of the
board did too.

Our business is keen to promote two PM NEDs on the board to show we have transformed our
culture but fails to invite its PM NEDS to Postmaster Listening events.

This contradicts our businesses ethos of change in culture and being postmaster-centric. This is not
the first time this has happened, and it is both unsurprising to me and deeply disappointing. This is
another example of the lack of engagement the retail team has had with me and Elliott whilst we
have been on the board.

On a positive note, I would urge all board members to attend these events as they will give you a
great understanding of what postmasters are thinking and feeling on the ground.
