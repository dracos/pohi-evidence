All,

Please find associated;
* Memorandum Of Understanding (MOU) in relation to Post Office Ltd (POL) / Royal Mail Group
(RMG) joint investigation protocols.
¢ Current template of RMG Investigation Team Managers (ITMs) and the areas they and their teams
cover.
The MOU was drafted and agreed pre-separation and should be adhered to whenever the need arises.
Please note (especially in view of 2"? Sight/Horizon) that there’s a need to determine whether
apprehension, searches, etc is an appropriate response where a POL employee or agent is the suspect in

a crime.

If you have any concerns regarding RMG proposed actions in a criminal investigation (e.g. you feel a more
cautious approach is warranted), please refer to your Team Leader in the first instance.

Regards,

Dave Posnett I Accredited Financial Investigator
