inary Investigation Report

Branch Name: Littleton Road I Branch Code: I 2824221 Case Number: I M066
Applicant Name: I Mr Chirag Status of Case: I Mediation Date of 21/12/2010
Patel Application Appointment:

Executive summary

The Applicant was employed at Littleton Road Post Office as a counter clerk by the former Subpostmaster
prior to his application as Subpostmaster. He was appointed Subpostmaster of the branch on 21 December
2010 and he held this position until his precautionary suspension on 27 May 2011. The suspension was a
result of the discrepancy revealed at audit. The branch was then operated by a Temporary Subpostmaster,
whilst investigations into the audit discrepancy took place.

Following an interview with the Contracts Advisor, the Applicant was reinstated on 3th August 2011 subject
to fulfilling certain conditions. The conditions included additional training provided by Post Office, that he
guaranteed that all monies proper to Post Office e.g. Lottery® and Paystation® would be transferred and
accounted for on a daily basis and that all weekly and monthly accounting documentation would be
despatched correctly.

Another audit was cartied out on 1 February 2012 and this led to the Applicant being subjected to a
precautionary suspension for a second time due to (1) the discrepancy found and (2) the Applicant’s failure
to comply with his reinstatement conditions.

This culminated in the Applicant’s contract for services being terminated by the Post Office on 8 March
2012.

The Applicant has applied to the Scheme and the main points in his complaint relate to:-
1) Disputed cash discrepancies 2) Lack of Training 3) Lack of Support 4) Horizon

Disputed Cash repancies

The Applicant cites that during his two periods of tenure as Subpostmaster of the branch he experienced
cash discrepancies which he believes can be explained by properly accounting for Giro cheques at the
branch. He therefore disputes the discrepancies identified by the Post Office.

Although Giro cheques were found at the branch when the audit was completed on 27 May 2011 these did
not explain the reported shortage as they had already been accounted for via Horizon.

The cash discrepancy of November 2011 was not as a result of an audit, but related to an amount settled
centrally by the Applicant on completion of his branch trading statement in August 2011.

The audit in February 2012 showed evidence of the Applicant having poor controls in place at the branch,
contrary to the conditions agreed for his reinstatement in August 2011 and despite additional training
having been provided to the Applicant on reinstatement.

There is evidence that Transaction Corrections were brought to account by the Applicant which should not

have been issued to him as they related to a period of time when he was not operating Littleton Road
branch. Records examined show that there is an overlap of Transaction Corrections issued when the
transfers from the former Subpostmaster to the Applicant and again after the transfer took place from the
Temporary Subpostmaster to the Applicant. [BD COMMENT: Was this a shortcoming on the part of Post
Office, the Temporary Subpostmaster or the Applicant? Did this create a loss for the Applicant?]
Notwithstanding this issue, it does not account for the discrepancies revealed at either Audit. [BD
COMMENT: Is there any reason to inform the Applicant of this issue? It does not form part of his complaint
and does not in any way affect the discrepancies which led to his termination? Consider deleting]

POL COMMENT: The shortcoming was on all 3 parties. Post Office did not complete the necessary
actions in a timely fashion to stop this happening. Both the Spmr and Temp Spmr should have
challenged if thought not proper to them.

Agree it doesn’t affect the result of the discrepancy leading to termination but this has been
potentially recovered from him already. This did go both in his favour and against with the net
effect being a charge to him of £3728,60 - So I included it in the interest of being fair to the
applicant?

Okay to take out if this is preferred but will need to remove source documents also, Caveat also that
this may appear to be ‘unusual’ as the TC documents are ones that are nearly always submitted as
part of the case review.

CK Comment; We do not agree that the information should be deleted. There is some evidence that
the TC’s were brought to account by the Applicant himself once he had resumed his duties. He may
at some stage recall this. Further, given that there is a degree of ambiguity as to who, and to which
period, these TC’s relate, then this material again could be seen as of assistance to the Applicant.

We are also concerned with the principle that the surpression of information in such circumstances
may fall outside of the ‘open and transparent’ nature of the Mediation process and, should the
material later emerge, prejudice the perception of POL’s good faith approach to Mediation.

Training
Evidence confirms that the Applicant was provided with adequate training by Post Office.

Eight days classroom training followed by six days on site training and one follow up balance support
session was delivered to the Applicant following the transfer of the branch to him. In addition, the Applicant
had worked in the branch for the former Subpostmaster and would have already had experience of and
been familiar with Horizon.

Following his reinstatement after the initial period of precautionary suspension, seven days additional
training was given to the Applicant to allow him to fulfil the conditions of his reinstatement.

During a support visit on 14 December 2011, further failings on the part of the Applicant to follow Post.
Office procedures were highlighted to the Applicant, including the need to account for Lottery transactions
correctly.

There is no evidence that the Applicant complained or raised concerns about a lack of training, or
inadequate training, at the time.

Lack of Support

Twenty two calls are recorded during the Applicant’s two periods of tenure; thirteen are during the period

2

POL-0106535
POL00108436

POL00108436

COMMERCIALLY SENSITIVE AND PREPARED IN CONNECTION WITH MEDIATION

cited in the complaint as the “most busy”. There is no evidence that supports the Applicant’s claim that
Network Business Support Centre (NBSC) failed to provide support.

There is also evidence that support was given in the number of support / training visits the Applicant
received following the jal problems.

Post Office agreed terms for the Applicant to repay the amounts due by way of instalments following the
initial discrepancy; this was as a gesture of goodwill from the Post Office and to prevent the Applicant
suffering undue financial hardship.

There is no evidence that the Applicant complained or raised concerns about poor or inadequate advice or
support at the time.

Horizon

Records examined do not support the claim that the Horizon “system” was changed. However, due to a
limited number of faults some of the components of Horizon were replaced e.g. printer. It is common for
components to be replaced if they develop faults, such as those arising from simple wear and tear. There
are no faults recorded by Fujitsu regarding Horizon base unitsConclusionin conclusion, it is Post office’s
conclusion that the Applicant was fully supported and adequate training was delivered initially and during
his tenure. Furthermore the Applicant did not display signs of improvement and did not adhere fully to the
conditions of reinstatement, although he was given ample time and support to do so.

The conduct process was undertaken in accordance with Post Office guidelines and the Applicant was given
both the opportunity to put forward his case either at an interview or by written submission on both
suspension occasions and a chance to improve performance when he was reinstated following initial
suspension.

It is Post Office’s view that the discrepancies in the branch arose as a result of the Applicant’s poor
operating controls in place, particularly with regard to Lottery and cash declarations. There is no evidence
that supports the Applicant’s claim that changes of Horizon equipment were to blame for the discrepancies
that arose or that Giro cheques have not been accounted for. The issues in the branch were down to
human error and the failure to apply and implement effective procedural controls.

Post Office regrets that transaction corrections may have been accepted by the Applicant which should
have properly been sent to the former or the temporary Subpostmaster, however this does not correlate
with the discrepancy revealed. [As stated above, is there any reason to inform the Applicant of this issue? It
does not form part of his complaint and does not in any way affect the discrepancies which led to his
termination? Consider deleting] _ See above first

The Applicant's assertion that ‘if he had training’ then the issues and discrepancies would not have occurred
cannot be substantiated on the evidence located. Post Office delivered more than the standard training
package and the Applicant was also given the opportunity to improve performance and operational controls
at the branch but he failed to do so.

The Applicant’s complaint

COMMERCIALLY SENSITIVE AND PREPARED IN CONNECTION WITH MEDIATION

The Application to the scheme was received by Post Office via Second Sight on 28 October 2013. A letter of
acceptance into the scheme (SLO1) was sent on 5 November 2013. A more detailed Case Questionnaire
Response (CQR) was received on 11 December 2013.

The main issues cited are detailed below:-

Disputed Cash Discrepancie:
© = May2011 £12485.77 (-)

Applicant states that the original discrepancy was £16,983.65(-) and upon further investigation by
Post Office was reduced to £12485.77(-).

The Applicant cites that this discrepancy can be explained by Giro Cheques found in a drawer
within the Branch after the initial cash check (part of the audit) was completed.

When Giro Cheques were raised at an interview with a Contracts Advisor (CA) on 22 July 2013 asa
possible cause of the discrepancy the CA appears to have considered this issue and concluded that
it could not have led to the discrepancy. Nothing has been revealed in this investigation which
casts doubt on the CA’s original conclusion with regard to the Giro Cheque issue.

The Applicant alleges that, at the same meeting, she stated that the discrepancy could be
explained because of the branch being in the incorrect Trading Period. She alleges that the point
was not considered properly, or responded to by, the CA,

Subpostmaster.

© 23 August 2011/2013 £1400.00 (-) The Applicant cites 23 August 2013 in the complaint but the
actual date was 3 August 2011)

Applicant states that an audit revealed discrepancy of £1400.00 (-) which although proper to the
Temporary Subpostmaster was allocated to his account.

© November 2011 - £6019.56 (-)

Applicant states that this amount was revealed during an audit and that it related to a failure on
his part to account for Lottery scratch cards correctly but that there was no actual “cash shortfall.”

The Contracts Manager demanded repayment of £6019.56 (-) This was repaid in monthly
instalments by the Applicant.

© 01 February 2012 - £2000.00 (-)

Applicant states that an audit revealed a discrepancy of around £2000 which again related to
Lottery Scratchcards. This led to his precautionary suspension due to his refusal to repay and

termination of his contract.
Lack of Training

Applicant alleges that no initial training was delivered to him by the Post Office.
Lack Of Support

© Applicant alleges that he made numerous calls to the NBSC particularly between 21 December
2010 and May 2011 and that the advice given was “not worthwhile”.

Cheques but that information he requested was not supplied,

Horizon

* The Applicant alleges in his CRQ that the Horizon “system” was replaced in the branch by Post
Office and this could have caused the discrepancies.

May 2011 £12485.77 (-)

Applicant cites audit result
of £16,983.65 reduced to
£12485.77.

The Applicant claims that
this discrepancy can be
explained by Giro
Cheques.

Issue raised Investigation findings
1. Discrepancies The audit on 27 May 2011 revealed a discrepancy of £16983.65(-). As

the Applicant was unable to make good on the day of the audit it was
transferred to the Late Account at Financial Service Centre (FSC).

The audit resulted in the precautionary suspension of the Applicant
who was subsequently reinstated on 03 August 2011 with conditions
imposed. (Doc 008 refer)

Subsequently a transaction correction of £4497.88 (+) was issued via
the Late Account Process, Therefore the amount held in the late
account at FSC in respect of the audit discrepancy would decrease by
this amount.

This would account for the difference cited by the Applicant. The
transaction correction related to the incorrect processing of a
currency order by the branch which culminated in the customer not
receiving their currency hence the subsequent issue of the
transactional correction. There are no records available which
indicate whether this was or was not explained to the Applicant,
although it is noted that the Applicant was not employed by the Post
Office when the issue was clarified.

Post Office findings confirm that Giro Cheques were present on the
day of the audit. Investigations suggest that the Giro Cheques had
been processed through Horizon prior to the audit taking place but
not despatched weekly as per Post Office procedures. As the Giro
Cheques had already been accounted for there would be no credit
due to the Applicant. The only omission was that the cheques were
not despatched from the branch as they should have been by the
Applicant.

There are no records to support the Applicant’s claim that these
amounted to £12491.00.

The experienced auditor on the day dispatched the Giro Cheques by

As branch was in an

this could explain any
discrepancy.

Special Delivery service to Girobank in Bootle. It has been confirmed
that the Giro Cheques were received by Girobank. (Doc 018 refers).

Records show that in accounting weeks 1, 2 and 3, in 2011 (Doc 006
refers) Girobank did not receive the weekly dispatch of Giro Cheques
from the branch. This was highlighted as the cheques had been
processed via Horizon when payment to the customer was made but
not physically despatched. The Applicant was written to and he
provided evidence of the cheques dispatched for weeks 1 and 2. This
evidence was in the form of listing of Giro cheques processed.

The Applicant failed to provide any evidence for Week 3 for an
amount of £3127.48 (-). Therefore an invoice Transaction Correction
was issued to the Branch on the 15/08/11 to correct this (Doc 007
refers).

Branches aré required to complete a Branch Trading Statement on a
specified date every four or five weeks via Horizon. This is a
statement of the cash and value stock held in the branch at that time
along with a record of transactions completed during the period.

The Subpostmaster is required as part of the balancing process to
complete a physical check of the cash and value stock held. There are
usually twelve trading periods in a financial year.

The audit of 27 May 2011 revealed that the branch had failed to
complete this requirement. Horizon was in Trading Period 10 but
should have been in Trading Period 3, The auditor completed the
required process to correct this without reporting any issues. (Doc
010 refers).

The Applicant states that he was unable to complete this task and
had reported this to NBSC. Records show on 18 May 2011 the
Applicant did report an issue with this process but the outcome
reports that the Applicant stated that he “knows what todo” (Doc
001 refers).

Examination of transaction and event logs for the period show that
the Applicant made no attempt to complete the Branch Trading
Statement process (Doc 026 refers).

Post Office accepts it should have monitored this activity more
closely and ensured that the branch was following the correct,
procedure at an earlier stage. However, failure to complete a Branch
Trading Statement would not cause any discrepancies in the branch
as the statement is a record of cash and stock on hand and
transactions completed during the period specified only. Can we also
stated that "The Applicant remains responsible and liable to Post
Office for any of the losses?”

When the Giro Cheques
and incorrect Trading
Period issues were raised
at an interview with a
Contracts Advisor on 22
July 2013 these issues
were referred to as a “red
herring”.

The Contracts Advisor
stated that Horizon was
always right and infallible.

The Applicant felt
compelled to pay the sum
due, in fear of losing his
post as Subpostmaster.
Repayment by instalments
was agreed.

Post Office is unable to confirm what was said at the interview as no
records are available. However, records show that the interviews
took place on 28 June 2011 and 22 July 2011. [BD COMMENT: Is the
Contracts Advisor available for comment?]Post Office is able to
determine that the issues raised regarding the incorrect Trading
Period and Giro Cheques did not create discrepancies in the branch
but are an indication of poor procedures put in place by the
Applicant.

Under the terms of the Subpostmaster’s contract the Subpostmaster
is required to make good all discrepancies immediately.

Section 12 Paragraph 12, the Subpostmaster is responsible for all
losses caused through his own negligence, carelessness or error.
Deficiencies due to such losses must be made good immediately.

Section 15 Paragraph 2, assistants are employees of the
Subpostmaster, a Subpostmaster will be held wholly responsible for
any failure on the part of his assistants. He will be required to make
good any deficiency, of cash & stock, which may result from his
assistant’s actions.

This contract was freely entered into by the Applicant at the time of
appointment and the terms and conditions of the contract are
discussed as part of the recruitment process.

Notwithstanding the above it is recognised this can cause financial
hardship. Therefore, as a gesture of goodwill, Post Office agreed to
repayment by instalments to lessen the financial burden on the
Applicant.

November 2011
£6019.56 (-)

Applicant alleges this
amount was found at
audit. Applicant admits
that this relates to a
failure on his part to.
account for Lottery scratch
cards correctly but there
was no actual “cash
shortfall.”

Discrepancy of £6019.56(-)

Post Office findings are that contrary to the Applicant’s complaint this
discrepancy did not relate to an audit at the branch.

The discrepancy was raised by letter to the Applicant due to amounts
settled centrally during completion of the trading statement of 25
August 2011. There is evidence that the Applicant repaid this amount
by deductions from remuneration commencing in November 2011.

The Applicant alleges that Horizon would not allow lottery
transactions to be recorded and that he reported this to NBSC.

Records show that the Applicant did not report a problem with

11

POL-0106535
POL00108436

POL00108436

COMMERCIALLY SENSITIVE AND PREPARED IN CONNECTION WITH MEDIATION

lottery transactions with NBSC at that time. There is evidence to
suggest that the reported discrepancy is likely to relate to Lottery
accounting based on previous branch performance, and the number
of transaction corrections issued.

Transaction and Event log data for November 2011 shows that
although the Applicant had been instructed in his action plan after his
onsite training (Doc 004 refers) and Conditions of Reinstatement (Doc
008) to ensure that Lottery was reconciled on a daily basis he failed
to comply with these instructions.

There is evidence that the Applicant had not accounted for lottery
transactions on a daily basis as an example on 03 November 2011
numerous days lottery transactions have been input to Horizon,
breaching the Conditions of Reinstatement.

Post Office could find no evidence of any reason why the lottery
transactions could not be recorded via Horizon. This would indicate
operator error as the likely cause.

23 August 2013 £1400.00
(-) (Actual date 03 August
2011)

Applicant cites that an
audit revealed discrepancy
of £1400.00 (-) which
although proper to.
Temporary Subpostmaster
was allocated to his
account.

Applicant cites he was
written to by Post Office
stating that an amount
was owed to him, but he
did not receive it.

On 03 August 2011 a transfer audit was completed. This audit was
conducted to reinstate the Applicant as Subpostmaster following his
precautionary suspension on 27 May 2011.

There are no records of any discrepancy reported at this audit,
financial records of transfer audits were only held for 60 days and
then destroyed.

Post Office records show no evidence of any amounts of £1400.00
being transferred to FSC on the day. However records do show an
amount of £1406.25 entered into the suspense account on 03 August
2011. As this was not settled centrally on that day it was not
allocated to the Applicant as cited.

Post Office has been unable to locate a copy of any letter to the
Applicant regarding repayment of a sum of £1400.00.

1 February 2012 £2000(-)

Applicant cites that an
audit revealed a
discrepancy of around
£2000 which again related
to Lottery Scratchcards

01 February 2012 Audit conducted results £9886.89(-). This is
contrary to the Applicant who claims that the result of the audit on
01 February 2012 was £2,000.00(-)

Records indicate that the Applicant was subjected to a precautionary
suspension at this time and ultimately this led to the termination of
his contract.

When the Applicant was re-instated on 03 August 2011 conditions
were imposed (Doc 008 refers) including that daily lottery accounting

was to take place.

There is no evidence that the Applicant had introduced the required
controls.

Retention of the appointment as Subpostmaster was dependent on
the branch being well managed and that the conditions outlined on
the Applicants reinstatement were adhered to.

The Applicant’s failure to follow Post Office’s operational and
compliance procedures in accordance with his contract as highlighted
in his letter of reinstatement was cited by the Contracts Advisor as a
factor which led to his precautionary suspension. (Doc 010, 011
Refer)

Training

Applicant cites that no
onsite training was
delivered. Had training
been received the
subsequent discrepancies
would probably not have
occurred.

The Applicant cites in his complaint that he did not receive any initial
training when he was appointed as Subpostmaster on the 21
December 2010,

Records indicate that the Applicant received the training that was
available at the time of his appointment and is provided to all
Subpostmasters.

Post Office records indicate (Doc 002 refers) that the Applicant
received classroom training at Stockport Counter Training Office from
08 December 2010 to 17 December 2010 (8 days) This was followed
by six days of onsite support between 21 December 2010 and 30
December 2010 (6 days) and further onsite support on 05 January
2011 when the first balance was completed. (Doc 003).

‘As normal practice the on-site Field Support Advisor (FSA) completed
a Performance Standards Assessment and an action plan was drawn
up. (Doc 004 refers)

The evidence that initial training was delivered is further supported
by the outcome and the response to the issues raised by Yasmin
Qureshi MP via Jo Swinson MP (Minister for Employment Relations
and Consumer Affairs. (Doc 003 refers)

The response from the Post Office at that time states that the
Applicant did receive both classroom and onsite training.

When the Applicant was reinstated on 03 August 2011 additional
training was provided by the Post Office as this was a condition of the
Applicant's reinstatement.

AFSA attended from the 03 August 2011 to 11 August 2011
providing additional support (Doc 005 refers). This was also an
opportunity for the Applicant to discuss any additional training that
he required.

The Applicant was able to make further requests for training via

POL00108436

POL00108436

COMMERCIALLY SENSITIVE AND PREPARED IN CONNECTION WITH MEDIATION

NBSC. Records show there were no requests for further training
from the Applicant logged with the NBSC (Doc 001 refers)

The Applicant did receive the standard training package. Issues still
arose with discrepancies, weak procedural controls and accounting
practices. Additional training was provided following his
reinstatement.

There is no evidence that the Applicant complained or raised
concerns about a lack of training, or inadequate training, at the time.

Support

Applicant cites that he
made numerous calls to
NBSC particularly between
21/12/2010 and May
2011. Advice given was
“not worthwhile”.

Evidence shows that during the period cited by the Applicant as the
period he made the most calls to NBSC, 13 calls were logged.

© Srelated to transactional enquires.

© Lrelated online issue transferred to HSD on 09 February
2011 due connectivity issue. Due to problem with telephone
line to branch. There is no record of the branch closing.

© 3 calls (on same day) 18 May 2011 reporting branch cannot
roll over, however examination of Event Logs indicate that
there were no attempts to complete the trading statement
on that day. Call was transferred to HSD they determined no
Horizon issue and passed caller back to NBSC during the call
he was asked if it was a training issue but the Applicant
stated that he is “trained and knows what to do”.

© 3 Relate to the day of transfer (21 December 2010 and the
set up)

e 1 Issue with counter printer.

22 calls were made during the Applicant's entire period of tenure.
Records show that after the three calls made to NBSC on 21
December 2010 related to the transfer of the branch no calls were
made until 09 February 2011. It would be expected that a new
Subpostmaster would make a higher volume of calls in the early
stages following their appointment.

There is no evidence that NBSC failed to provide a response to the
questions asked by the Applicant and no indication that he did not
understand or accept the advice given.

There is no evidence that the Applicant complained or raised
concerns about poor or inadequate advice or support at the time.

The Applicant alleges that contact was made with FSC in regard to the
Giro Cheques.

Contact was made with
Financial Service Centre
regarding Giro Cheques
but requested information
was not supplied.

Post Office has no record of any request or telephone conversation
with the Applicant so it is difficult to determine why the information
requested was not supplied. The assumption is that this could relate
to a data protection issue but Post Office cannot support this view. A
copy of the giro cheque listing should be retained in the branch If this
was the evidence requested it would have been available.

Horizon Issues

The Applicant cites that
shortly after this the
Horizon system was
replaced in the branch by
Post Office and this could
have caused
discrepancies.

Evidence from the HSD log (Doc 015 Refers) confirms that there was
no system replacement during his tenure as Subpostmaster.

There were equipment changes and faults rectified:-
© Routine replacement of counter printer (16 March 2011),

© BT line issue (12 April 2011),unable to roll office over/Fujitsu
unable to find any faults/call passed back to NBSC (18 May
2011),

© Back office printer kept jamming advised to order new drum
(25 May 2011)

‘© Keyboard fault (06 October 2010)
© Monitor fault (24 November 2011)

If equipment develops a fault and cannot be repaired by the on-site
Fujitsu engineer the item is replaced . This is standard practice and
does not indicate any specific or inherent failure in the Horizon
system.

Period of Suspension

* During the period of precautionary suspension, remuneration is not paid as there is no

provision of service.

© Prior to a Temporary Subpostmaster taking over terms is agreed between the Temporary

Subpostmaster and the ‘suspended’ Subpostmaster; this is advised in the suspension
letter sent by the Contract Advisor.

During the investigation into the Applicant’s complaint additional findings have been revealed

and are listed below:

There are numerous disparities in dates, amounts and facts between the Initial
Application, the Case Review Questionnaire and actual events(Doc 009 refers). Itis

acknowledge that the Applicant may not have the benefit of reviewing
contemporaneous documents to clarify dates and that he may therefore rely on

memory.

© During a Post Transfer Visit (undertaken as part of on-going support after a
branch transfer) on the 14 December 2011 it was stressed to the Applicant

15

POL00108436
POL00108436

the need to account for scratch card sales correctly. His failure to act on
advice and manage the branch to the required standard could have been
contributed to the two discrepancies revealed at audit. (Doc 013 refers)

e — Records show that all amounts held at Financial Service Centre were subject to write
off. When the final trading statement was prepared during the Audit of 01 February
2012. Post Office made an error by recording the amount of £8581.63 twice. The
amount was incorrectly shown as both a “Deficiency in final trading statement” and “
Deficiency made good at final trading statement” This administrative error did not
however alter the audit result.

The Applicant’s contract was terminated on 08 March 2012. Evidence confirms
(Doc 014 Refers) that the Applicant’s contract was terminated in accordance
with Post Office procedures. The Applicant was offered two face to face
meetings or to provide written submissions as to why his Subpostmaster’s
contract should not be summarily terminated but he failed to respond to either
request. The Applicant states in the CQR “that he did not avail himself” of these
opportunities. The meetings would have given the Applicant the opportunity to
present his reasons why his contract should not be terminated, but chose not to
attend or supply any written submissions.

© Horizon Event logs for the period 01 November 2011-16 November 2011(Doc
028 Refers) detail cash declarations made. Whilst a cash declaration can be made
at any time it is normal practice to declare cash once per day usually at close of
business. There is evidence of cash declaration being made just prior to close of
business and again the following morning. Variances (actual cash declared
compared to the Horizon expected figure of cash on hand) are declared and
there are some large discrepancies reported. This is an indication of poor
procedures in the branch.

The Applicant worked at the branch as an assistant prior to his appointment as
Subpostmaster.
