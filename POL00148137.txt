Business improvement Programme etc.--Whilst there is suggestion that other avenues should always be considered and
rejected before a criminal investigation is commenced, there will always be cases where it is immediately apparent that
criminal investigation should be commenced with view to prosecution to protect POL brand and reputation and in the
interest of the business etc.,

It would perhaps be sensible for Brian to advise on the proposed procedures to be put in place to ensure that such cases
are not compromised through exploration of other avenues?
