CWP TITLE: IMPACT Release 3: Counter and Host changes

(Delete as applicable)

CHANGE WORK PACKAGE DESCRIPTION:

This Change Work Package provides for Fujitsu Services to implement a quantity of twelve
changes to the Host and Counter software as requested by Post Office Ltd and defined below.

Fujitsu Services has not yet formally received the CRs listed below and the requirements to
which the work will be conducted are as described below for each of the twelve CRs. The
terms under which the work will proceed is defined in a letter from Mr. Bill Reynolds (Fujitsu
Services) to Ms.Sue Harding (Post Office Ltd) Ref S80/CRs dated 21 October 2004, that was
responded to by letter from Mr. Steve Grayston (Post Office Ltd) to Mr. Bill Reynolds (Fujitsu
Services) dated 26 October 2004.

(CR 268) Move Point 30 Migration changes to Point 50.

A number of changes are currently defined as taking place at Point 30. These are primarily
associated with changes to the Housekeeping menu.

All these changes should now occur at Point 50. This change should be purely a case of
changing the Soft Launch Reference Data

(CR 271) Use week number instead of TP in Giro Bank reports

Changes are needed in the headers on a number of reports produced by Horizon. In
particular these changes need to be made to GiroBank reports. The precise list of reports
affected by this change is not currently available, but should be assumed to be about 6
reports for costing purposes. The list will be specified before the CP is implemented

The change is to include “Wk nn” in the header instead of the current “CAP cc” or the
proposed “TP tt”. The Week number should be the current ISO week number starting with
Wk 1 in January. The Week should go from Monday to Sunday (ie the week number
changes on a Monday morning).

This change needs to occur at Point 30 in the migration, ie any reports produced after the
rollover of the Point 30 CAP should be in the new format.

(CR 278) Trading Periods should be allowed to increase up to 99

The Trading Period calendar will define 12 Trading Periods for a year. However should a
branch rollover Trading Periods too frequently, there is a danger that they will run out of
Trading Periods before the next year’s calendar is available. In this case artificial Trading
Period numbers should be used to allow the branch to continue. Warnings should be given
as at present when a branch is attempting to rollover into a Trading Period that is too far
ahead.

(CR 280) Remove Training Mode

The Training Mode button should be removed from the Desktop at a suitable point.
This will remove the need to validate Training Mode.

(CR 263) Change the format of Article from Number (10) to Char (10) in all cases.

Article is used in a number of tables in the RDMC. RDDS and TPS databases. It has been
decided that it needs to be alphabetic rather than numeric and so its format needs to be
changed.

This change also requires amended versions of the following AISs:
BP/IFS/010 “Application Interface Specification Reference Data to Fujitsu Services Limited” v6.5
(POL ref RDP/AIS/014)

EA/IFS/003 “Horizon to POL Finance Systems Interface Specification” v1.2 (POL ref EA/IFS/R3901)

EA/IFS/002 “POL Finance Systems to TMS / Horizon ‘Transaction Corrections Interface Specification” v1.7
(POL ref EA/FS/002).

(CR 272) Change to the interface to POL MIS.
This change affects TPS Host only.

A number of changes are required for this interface:

§ Remove ‘PURCHASED QUANTITY’ from the bureau additional data in
section B.5

§ Allow positive and negative values to be populated in the Amount field and the
Quantity field on the Transaction Detail record

§ Populate the Amount field with the sign recorded within Horizon, i.e. remove
processing that converts negative signs to positive.

§__ To indicate the presence of ‘Additional Data’ for a transaction detail record, it is
proposed that the Record Type Identifier is used.

S Remove references to maintaining the list of additional data attributes using the
POL Reference Data System

This change also requires amended versions of the AIS:
EA/IFS/006 “Horizon to POL MIS AIS” v1.1.

(CR 275) Change to the interface to HR SAP
This change affects TPS Host only.

Changes are required to the way in which signs are handled on the interface.

In essence the bulk of the data to be passed to HRSAP should be positive regardless of
whether the transactions were for in-payments or out-payments, This can be achieved by
considering the accounting sense of each product as part of the HR SAP summarisation
process and converting the sign of out-pay transactions. Accounting sense is already
available as part of the PRODUCT_TRANS_MODE_HISTORIES Reference Data available
to the TPS host.

This change also requires amended versions of the AIS:
EA/IFS/015 “Horizon To HR SAP System - Applications Interface Specification” v2.0 (POL ref EA/HR/001)

(CR 276) Changes to Error handling on the Transaction Correction Interface
This change affects TPS Host and also CS operational procedures.
Horizon needs to monitor the delivery of files across this interface and raise operational
alerts should the files not be delivered when expected. Such alerts should not result in

callouts but should be processed on the next working day using techniques similar to those
used for the POL FS interface introduced by CP 3775.

The list of permissible errors in the AIS is to be amended to reflect the HLD. This aspect is
a documentation only change to the AIS.

This change also requires amended versions of the AIS:

tion” V1.7

(CR 277) Introduce a new value for Quantity on the POL FS Article table.

In order to support stock by Value products (such as “Other stamps”) correctly a new value
(“QV”) is required for the Quantity field. This may impact RDMC / RDDS if they validate
the permissible values in this field. It will impact TPS since if an Article Mode is
configured with Quantity = QV, then the Quantity field in the POL FS interface details
record should be set to the value (in pence).

This change also requires amended versions of the following AISs:

BP/IFS/010 “Apy ition Interface Specification Reference Data to Fujitsu Services Limited” v6.5

(POL ref RDP/AIS/014).

Note: The ‘QV* change has been omitted from v6.5 of this AIS. Fujitsu Services is progressing this Change
Request on the basis that the ‘QV’ value will be added to the Quantity Field for future issues of this AIS.

EA/IFS/003 “Horizon to POL Finance Systems Interface Specification” v1.2 (POL ref EA/IFS/R3901)

(CR 264) Change to the POL FS to Horizon TC Functional Specification and AIS

This change affects TPS Host only.
Make Good should be a Permitted Mode when Allowed Modes is set to 51 or 52
This change also requires amended versions of the AIS:

EA/IFS/002 “POL Finance Systems to TMS / Horizon Transaction
(POL ref EA/IES/002)..

‘rections Interface Specification” v1.7

(CR 287) Add Site to the RDS to Horizon AIS & Horizon to POL FS AIS

This change affects TPS Host and RDMC / RDDS Hosts.

POL FS uses two identifiers for the branch. A profit centre and a site. The profit centre
uses the 6 character FAD code, but the site is a 4 character field and hence can not use the
FAD code. Site is an attribute of Branch/Outlet organisation unit on the S80 RDS design.
The site code is used particularly for the Horizon to POL FS interface as part of the POS
inbound processing. In order to maximise the efficiency and speed of this interface the site
should be included in the interface file from Horizon to POL FS. In order to achieve this
efficiency the site should be included in the interface from RDS to Horizon.

This change also requires amended versions of the following AISs:

BP/IFS/010 “Application Interface Specification Reference Data to Fujitsu Services Limited” v6.5
(POL ref RDP/AIS/014)

EA/IFS/003 “Horizon to POL Finance Systems Interface Specification” v1.2 (POL ref EA/IFS/R3901)

(CR 289) Change the name, format and relevant values for the field Dummy in POL FS Article
entity in the RDS to Horizon interface.

This change affects TPS Host and RDMC / RDDS Hosts.

The current field Dummy in the POL FS Article entity that has two allowed values D&R. It
has been established that this is not sufficient to allow the Horizon to POL FS interface to
run efficiently. There is a field on RDS against article called Article Type. This is a two
character field with a range of values allowed. The field Article Type should replace the
field Dummy in the AIS RDS to Horizon and AIS Horizon to POL FS (Branch Ledger), and
in Horizon system.
