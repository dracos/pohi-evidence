lagree,

Martin, please talk to Andy and Rachel and get a list up. Please also advise Jarnail when reporting,
that we have another one.

We need to consider counsel in the Bradford case as well. We can't expect HB to take them all. Rachel
please check availability with Cyndi/Caroline.

Please show/ copy the Wylie letter to Jarnail.

Subject: CASE NO 24676 - Prosecution of Ishaq

Rachael,

The case of Ishaq was committed yesterday from Bradford MC to Bradford Crown Court. The PCMH
has been scheduled for 4th September 2012 at 10.00 a.m.

The defendant's solicitor made it clear that the functionality of the Horizon system would be an
issue. The defendant has instructed them that the correct amount of money will be there in the
accounts somewhere and that there is an error with Horizon. "Everyone has heard about the
problems with Horizon!"

This is going to be another of those cases where we will have to anticipate and deal with the Horizon
issue and consider our approach.

Andy - I think we should draw up a separate list of cases in which we anticipate Horizon arguments

so that we can ensure that we have appropriate answers/ material and agreed tactics for the PCMH's

the dates of which will undoubtedly arrive well before the Post Office are likely to have obtained any
reports.

Martin.
