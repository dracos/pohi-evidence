T2 Findings Report Template

Based on changes that are happening
within the business, some internal
improvements, process changes and
progress and continuous improvement
opportunities, some changes were made to
the existing report template

Feedback from Quality Assurance, T2 and 13
was taken into account to redesign the
report. As well as other external input (E
and Y)

Purpose:

+ Standardisation

+ Make it simpler for everyone

+ Include some of the requirements going forward

* Long term aim is to have one version of the report for all
Network Resolution stages

POL00448220
POL00448220

What’s
changed?

The main format of the report has not changed. Just
some of the design

The three main sections of your report are still there.
* Case Summary

+ Overview of Investigation

+ Case Outcome and recommendations

There has been a little bit of guidance added to the boxes
(some ‘what good looks like’ or structure tips)

We have also added a
case data box at the end

to be embedded

The biggest change to
the report is the
checklist.

Updated and improved.
It still gives you the
list of things that
should be checked in an
investigation.

All the things that
were in the checklist
before - however the
questions are updated
to be relevant to
processes now.

The format has been
amended to bring
uniformity to Tier 2

Downloading data for your cases

* Save the files in the following format

Branch code_branch name_what it is_Dates covered
Example:
123456_Anytown_SessionData_1apr22-1apr23

* Upload a raw copy of the data to Dynamics as soon as you have
downloaded it
* Save the file with raw data in the title
123456_Anytown_SessionData_1apr22-1apr23_raw data

You can then save a separate version of the data as your working copy
for analysis

POL00448220
POL00448220

Saving the report

You should be downloading the report template from Dynamics for every case.

This should pre populate the branch details in the top sections of the report for you
+ Always check that these are correct and that any blank sections are completed

At the point that you download to template save it in the following format
Tier 2 Findings Report_Branch name_Branch code_Case number

Example
Tier 2 Findings Report_Anytown_123456_CAS-123456

You should also upload the postmaster ve

Writing

POL00448220
POL00448220

Report writing should be like telling a story.

All good stories are set out in the same way - Providing a beginning, a middle and an end.

Our investigations should do the same thing. To make that easier the report is broken down into the three

Case Summary:

It should includ

+ How the case was raised

+ Any information that the branch have told us that could highlight

it all together.

A summary of what your
investigation found. What
conclusions that the analysis and
data gave you

This is the section to outline what
you believe the next steps are.
Should the amount be cleared as
good will, should it be escalated
to another department.

It should clearly outline if the
discrepancy has been established or
not

Decision and Action Log

Agreed process is to record decisions and actions from the investigation into the log
+ This would be Decisions such as:

* asking Network Monitoring to look at potential Branch Assurance Visit

* Asking Stock team to complete stock check for a TC to be issued

+ Referring the case to weekly review
* Actions would be things like:

+ Sharing the findings with Area Manager to provide support

* Sending intervention request to training team

The decisions should be the things you identify outside of the normal realm of your investigation

You should include the name of the person making the decision — this could be your name or the name of

the person making the decision e.g. manager.

Actions should all link to the decision.

Top Tips:-

When writing reports, the use of Acronyms is allowed provided that you have written it out in full

the first time its used, and the acronym is clearly displayed
e.g. A debit Transaction Correction (TC) was issued to the branch on 15" June 2022. The TC relates to...

Cash values remember to use your comma’s e.g. use £5,000.00 not £5000.00
Date formats — use long hand i.e. 15t” May 2023.

Spell check is your friend — also use the grammar check
* On word, in the ribbon at the top, select we De then editor

Aas

Make sure there is no opinion - Be aware of language used. Be factual in the report.

POL00448220
POL00448220

* Ensure that your report actually shows what happened not just the cash flow

Explain/reflect how the discrepancy values appear — was it a gradual build or a sudden
appearance

* Show your workings

Explain what you have found, and if it shows it wasn’t related, state it in the report

* Include evidence to support your point

All data snippets should have a clear explanation for what you are showing.

* i.e. The table below shows an extract from HORice of session data that shows x,y,Z...

Session data revealed that on 1* December 2023, the user SKLS processed an existing reversal, however, only the
‘method of payment was reversed and not the full transaction, The table below shown the HORice extract of
session data that shows the pre-order currency transaction being processed on 25: November 2023, and only the
‘method of payment processed as an existing reversal on 1 December 2023.

* Make sure all data snippets have the column headers and relevant columns

For your snippets hide the columns that show information that is not required such as
duplicate date columns, or product number.

POL00448220
POL00448220

Your outcome should always clearly outline if the discrepancy is
established as a genuine loss to Post Office or if it has not been
established.
