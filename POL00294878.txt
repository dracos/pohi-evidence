Hi — if you want to engage or devolve to Dave Hulbert and/or Dave Gray please could you advise them.

Subject: JFSA - Coordination of response

Please find attached a short proposal for a steering group to define and manage, in a cohesive and pragmatic manner,
our response to the JFSA challenges.

This is intended to align existing work in Security, P&BA, Legal, IT, Network and Press Office and follows on from the
discussion in yesterday's Operating Board.

Please do advise any comments or questions on any aspects of this paper and of the group I propose to convene.

That group is Angela Van Den Bogerd, Lesley Sewell, Mike Granville, Dave Pardoe, Rebekah Mantle, Hugh
Flemington and David Simpson.

I am inviting the group for a first conference call on Friday afternoon and will provide an update to the next Operating
Board. Meeting invite to follow.

Thanks, Rod
