1. Introduction
[HYPERLINK \1l "P3"]

Compliance with Post Office Limited’s legislative and
regulatory obligations is vital and something that everyone
must do wherever they work in this Business. In an environment
of greater transparency, mobilised customer scrutiny and

POL-BSFF-0237968_0001
POL00423153
POL00423153

increasingly proactive regulators, any failure to comply with
our legal and regulatory requirements could have a significant
impact, both in terms of financial implications and
reputational damage.

The Post Office is enormously proud of the trust our customers
have in our brand and in order to retain that trust, we must
adhere to robust policies and procedures that demonstrate our
commitment to fulfill the following obligations:

Conduct its business with integrity

Operate with due skill, care and diligence

Observe proper standards

Be transparent in all business dealings

Treat our customers fairly

Provide adequate protection to customers

Deal with all regulators in an open and honest way

It is therefore important that we all understand the
implications of these legislative and regulatory obligations as
we go about our day-to-day work. Everybody has a duty to comply
with these as they apply to their job or area of
responsibility.

This document has been designed as a source of reference for
all the areas of legislation and regulation that Post Office
Limited is governed by, especially those relating to our higher
profile regulators such as Ofcom, Postcomm, Financial Services
Authority (FSA) and Her Majesty’s Revenue & Customs (HMRC). The
primary purpose of this document is to clearly state the
allocation of ownership between Post Office Limited's directors
and each of the regulatory and legislative obligations that
Post Office Limited is subject to.

For further information on any of the sections in this
document, or on how we manage compliance within the Post
Office, please contact Keith Woollard in the first instance on

4. Assurance
[HYPERLINK \1l "P3"]

This compliance framework forms part of the Post Office’s
Governance processes.

The Board and other stakeholders will gain assurance in
respect of the extent of compliance across the business
and the appropriateness of controls through: -

* Periodic self assessment activities performed by
identified owners

* Independent validation work, performed by Royal Mail
Internal Audit & Risk Management (IARM). IARM manage
the validation of critical business processes across
the Royal Mail Group and Post Office's identified
critical business processes include a key sub
process of Regulation and Legislation.

* Activities performed by the Compliance Team (as set
out in the Annual Assurance Plan)

* Monitoring by the Risk & Compliance Committee (a sub
committee of the Board) as set out in the terms of
reference for the committee

The self-assessment and independent validation processes
referred to will be signed off by the Managing Director
and reported to the Corporate Risk Management Committee.
This will enable the Post Office to provide its statutory
declaration on risk and control in its annual report

5. Disciplinary Statement
[HYPERLINK \l "P3"]

Compliance with legal and regulatory requirements is not
optional and disciplinary measures will be applied in
cases of wilful, persistent or negligent non-compliance.
The Royal Mail Group Employee Disclosure (Whistleblowing)
Policy (G7) and Post Office Limited Employee Disclosure
Policy that allows for anyone in the Business to raise

reprisal
