Notes of Meeting:

1 Introduction & Meeting Purpose

21

Dave Smith outlined the purpose of the meeting which was
to review progress against achieving roll out criteria /
acceptance and decide on re-commencement of roll out.

Performance against criteria

Dave Smith summarised the key areas which were at issue

for the continuation of roll out on 24 January. These were:

« the rectification of outstanding data integrity weaknesses
(A1376/3)

the clarification and resolution of weaknesses in help
desk performance (AI408/3)

« the resolution of issues with the management of
reference data

«the satisfactory deployment and operation of the
integrity control

He identified that for each of these areas there was now an
agreed way forward and that robust checks had been putin
place to address the original concerns. However, there
were still further checks to be completed by TIP on the
deployment of the integrity control. Further work also
needed to be done between Horizon Commercial and ICL
Pathway on reaching contractual agreement on the third
supplemental agreement (CCN600).

He advised that at this stage the Post Office would not wish
to exercise their right to the suspension of roll out, but were
not able to give confirmation that they would not suspend
until TIP had completed its checks on the integrity control
and the issues around the drafting and agreement of the
third supplemental agreement had been addressed.

Tony Oppenheim advised that ICL Pathway intended to
move forward with POCL on the contractual agreement
immediately following the meeting. The meeting between
Andy Radka and Steve Muchow earlier in the day on the
outstanding issues surrounding AI408/3, and the level of
agreement that had been reached would facilitate this
contractual discussion. It was intended that the summary
of actions that had been produced as a result be
incorporated as a working document, following review by
the lawyers of both parties.

Keith Baines advised that the six weeks of parallel running
between TIP and Pathway had been completed with no
obvious problems, but that the check of the final weeks
results was still in progress and until the checks were
complete it was not possible to confirm that the deployment
of the accounting integrity control release was satisfactory.
The results of the checks were due by early on 18 January.

Tony Oppenheim asked if it would be possible to reach a
decision by 18 January. Keith Baines advised that the final
drafting of the third supplemental agreement needed to be
completed, with a review of the outcome of the

24 November and 14 January decision activities by the Post
Office lawyers. Tony Oppenheim advised that ICL
Pathway would be content on that basis.

Agreed that if the actions in place to address the
outstanding elements of agreement worked, and no further
issues arose prior to signing the third supplemental
agreement, there was no requirement for a further meeting.
