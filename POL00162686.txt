Hi Jane,

Attached is Jonathan’s reply to your most recent note. Given we agreed that the answer’s to Q6 & 7 would be provided
to him tomorrow, can I suggest the following as a response:

Dear Jonathan,

In my email of 10 October 2015, I sent you a draft chronology of events over the last four years and said that I would
provide you with the documents it is drawn from early this week. Having now collected c75% of these documents it is
apparent that, due to their volume, doing so would involve providing a huge (136MB) amount of documentation — not
all of which would necessarily be helpful to you at this stage of the work.

Can I suggest instead that, looking at the updated Chronology I attach, you identify any documents you feel you would
particularly like to see at this juncture and I will ask the team here to get them over to you as soon as possible? For
information purposes, those ‘events’ that are highlighted in yellow have been previously supplied and those with a ‘tick’

in the ‘schedule’ column have had their supporting documentation identified.

In respect of the outstanding questions (6 & 7) you posed in the draft Terms of Reference - I hope to be in a position to
provide answers to these tomorrow.

Kind Regards

Jane
