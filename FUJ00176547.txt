[fhe attachment Gap There is a

sen print which shows the Message Gap (Node 1 : 103980 to 103984).

fhe attached Gap Abs Rep is a screen print that shows the Crypto Error being reported.

[fhe attachement Gap Not There is a screen print that shows the "Size of Gaps" reported as NONE but two gaps in the message

impact:

though the circumstances that cause the error may not occur very frequently I believe that it is vital from the Audit point of
dew that these reports accurately report this type of information.

Audit Dev need to confirm but suggest that this needs to be Reset 10

Note: Cryptographic errors will result in the failure of the integrity of the ARQ data and as such will not be used.

the following observations were made:
) Changes to BAL Certificate results in "Termination" of the abstraction and the whole file contents are ignored for the
