Subject: FW: Next Monday ExCo

Hi all - see below - Paula would like to meet 10-11 (or 11.30 if necessary) to prep for the SS meeting (and TH if that's scheduled).
Suggest we need Belinda, Chris A, David, Mark and myself. Also Chris D if available, as Paula suggests below (Ruth - please can
you put it on hold in his diary?).

Thanks,

Martin

Hi Martin, I have just seen that I have a meeting with Second Sight next Monday.

That meeting will take some preparation for a number of reasons, not least our position before Wed Board. The only slot I have is
the Monday ExCo slot, so I wondered if you would mind chairing it and explaining my absence and that of a couple of other
colleagues (Chris A, Chris D, Martin E.)

Martin E - would you mind briefing the others and advise who else you think should come along to the prep session.

Thanks both,

I won't be looking at emails, so i

I need to see one - pls text.
