Very much want to pick up the ERA lessons learned. Think you have been given a very difficult commission and I do
have some ideas on how this needs to be done and the extent of my own involvement,

I wouldn't mind seeing the full Horizon PIR as I have a ‘lessons learned’ meeting next week on project ERA in line with
Alan Barrie's request to produce a lessons learned report. I would also be grateful for a steer from yourself on how to
approach this and the input you would like to make. Perhaps we can discuss when we meet on Friday
