Definition Schedules. These updated the relevant
parts of the Agreements for changes that had been
agreed but for which the Authorities had not issued
new texts. After the Acceptance Specification was
published the Authorities rejected the CCN. For this
reason the guidance notes stated the letter was no
longer material.

No new contract texts were forthcoming from the
Authorities. Therefore to reference any changes (to
accounting and reporting in this case) it is now
necessary to look at the Change Control history.
Accordingly this was provided as an additional
document, see yellow rows. With the withdrawal of

11/6 (911/1) This issue is that POCL seek evidence of
such integrity through access to the end-to-end design
documentation. Reliance on the test results is not
acceptable to POCL. ICL Pathway’ position is that
POCL do not have rights of access to design
intellectual property. It was agreed that POCL and
Pathway would refer the issue to their commercial
authorities.

Pathway’s commercial authority's position is that
POCL does not have such rights. The end-to end
design has been provided under non-disclosure
agreement to named individuals within POCL. These
individuals may be asked if such a design exists and if
it is satisfactory in their opinion. These individuals
may not disclose the contents of such end-to end
designs to others within POCL.

11/6 (911/2) In the case of the first part the issue is
that POCL seek evidence that the reversion works
through access to the appropriate part of the systems
management design. Reliance on the test results is
not acceptable to POCL. ICL Pathway offered to
provide the Low Level Test Scripts. See 911/1 above.

In the case of the second part POCL will provide the
presentation to the POCL panel.

Where does the evidence prove the technical and
commercial viability and how does the SADD doc.
provide the detail required in the last part

The commercial viability for POCL cannot be
evidenced by means of a Pathway Architecture
Design. POCL commercial viability can only be
proven by estimating the costs and revenues for a
particular supplier, which, by definition, is not ICL
Pathway, performing Service replacement(s). The
Criterion does not require such evidence: the first
sentences are statements of fact introducing and
explaining the reason for the requirements in the
sentence beginning: “To support this the
CONTRACTOR shall ...”. The technical viability is
similarly partly a function of the capability of the
supplier in question. That the Services are technically
replaceable is evidenced by the Service separations.
The Criterion is in two parts: first that the interfaces
are declared in the SADD, and second that the level
of specification is comparable with those in the
referenced requirements.

The interfaces are declared in SADD Appendix B -
Interfaces and functionally elaborated in the
appropriate sections in the body of the SADD.

The Interface Principles and Service Boundaries are
described in B.1. (Excluding DSS) the interfaces are
declared: EPOSS B.3.1 (read to exclude BPS
aspects); APS B.3.2; OBCS B.3.3.

The level of detail provided is significantly greater
than that provided in requirements 934-939 [940 no
longer existed] and 942 when functional material,
which is elaborated in the appropriate sections in the
body of the SADD, is taken into account.. Note that
none of these Requirements was a POCL one.
