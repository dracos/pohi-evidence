Paul

Thanks for your time earlier. Please find attached your draft statement for your comments. I've also attached a few
documents referred to in the statement for you to consider.

I'd also be grateful for your thoughts on the Subrem attached. In particular...

Para 11 that reads...When the letter accepting appointment is returned, Sub Office Services should notify the
outgoing SubPostmaster in writing of the date of

transfer, with a reminder to have the SubPostmaster contract document (Red book) ready for passing on to
the incoming Subpostmaster. You should also notify all other interested parties (e.g. Payroll, National
Savings Bank, Girobank etc.) confirming date of transfer.

What is the Red Book?

Para 14 that reads.... At the transfer it is most important that signed copies are obtained of the form P.13
(Official Secrets Act), and acknowledgement of appointment. P250 and P272 should be completed for any
new assistant which may be employed also for completeness of identification of Sub office assistants we
would suggest a new P356 be raised. The officer responsible for the transfer should be careful to clearly
show which operational equipment and Rules Book are on hand. Completed forms P301 are required from
outgoing Subpostmasters and assistants.

What is the Rules Book?

Thanks

Andy
