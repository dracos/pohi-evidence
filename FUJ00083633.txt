ny ‘run map' critical events on various FADs

Ir} Response :

these events were investigated in the past (PC0058994) but the call was
closed on the basis that the errors were no longer occurring.

lanalysis of the events in the last month shows 2132 of these events. In many
cases there is just one, or a small number, on affected counters, but FAD
274470 generated over 900 one day, and 191323 over 100. Spreadsheet attached.

New evidence added - run map events by FAD

bate:24-Feb-2003 12:16:00 User:Anne Chambers

IF} Response :

I think it is likely that the event storms of this particular event have the
same underlying cause as the "An unexpected error occurred while attempting
to insert a message" events which we also sometimes get. Something in the
balancing process is hanging onto a lock. PC0086212 has been sent to
development for further investigation. KEL AChambers330S updated.

this call can be closed.
