Subject: Re: Post Office - meeting with Jonathan Swift QC
Jane,

I was happy with Jonathan, and the work he has done so far. We also had a useful discussion, fully reflected in
your notes. I think that fortnightly updates will work well, but let us see how things go. If anything crops up of
which you think I should be aware, please do not hesitate to get in touch.

Best

Tim

have summarised the outputs of the meeting (see below) and have tasked my team with setting up the
plan to deliver this, and to action the various items. As you will see, we expect to have regular updates

with Jonathan and Christopher Knight (the junior who will support him} to ensure that we are delivering
against the plan.

I propose to provide you with a fortnightly email update on progress against the plan. Please let me
know if you would prefer a different format/frequency. From time to time we will also need to brief you
in more detail on specific issues.

{ hope this will work for you.
Kind regards,

Summary of meeting between Tim Parker and Jonathan Swift QC on 20/10/2015

Both are concerned that in order to address the issues that have been publicly raised, we need to
get whatever assurance is possible in relation to the challenge as to whether Horizon faults are
behind the underlying claims. In addition, they believe that we should do ‘deeper dives' on those
few cases that regularly receive the media attention (Jo Hamilton, Seema Misra, etc) .

To summarise the other matters discussed:
Focus of the investigation:

criminal cases - did we have sufficient evidence to support the charges brought?

IT system - what can we do to establish that the system was not the underlying cause of the
claims (eg remote access; changes can't be made without leaving an audit trail etc)

Helpdesk - was the general approach appropriate? (Concern is around the allegation that
postmasters were advised to take actions which resulted in them committing false accounting)
other cases - were they investigated properly; was anything not covered which should reasonably
have been addressed; is there anything obviously not done; if so, could it be done now?

Ways of working:

we to find a room at FD or BD's offices where we can store files

we to set up meeting with Chris Knight (Junior Counsel ) to discuss how best to give access to
required documents . Jonathan will attend if possible

we to set up meeting between Chris & one of the investigators to take Chris through the
investigation process. Jonathan may attend.

we to set up regular review meetings (weekly/fortnightly) to review progress

Documents/information to be provided to Jonathan now:

copies of CCRC requests

examples of prosecution reports summarising the recommended prosecution and supporting
evidence.

what documentation do we have that describes the investigation processes that we went through
under the scheme?
