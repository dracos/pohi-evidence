Both

As stated in my final update a few weeks back, the file containing the email history for Post office
testing team individuals resident in Bracknell in 2008 is held by the Information Security team.

Mark Pearce/Dave King were central to preparing a copy of the data file ahead of handover to Second
Sight. They will have more detailed knowledge of the information contained and how it was received from
csc.

Thanks
steve

get high level support for the review, and clear evidence about any central system which can adjust sub
postmaster accounts if it exists, and its controls.

they have suggested there are failures at this stage.

know she was planning a trip home to NZ and may not be available until after recess so we loose 2 weeks!

letter ends up not saying what we heard but we cannot risk the delay

Dear all, just a quick note to say thank you for your help and briefing for the above.
Alwen has a set of notes from the call, so you are very welcome to consult those for a full debrief.

It went as well as we could have hoped. James agreed to most of what we asked him to do. We will need
© wait for him to consult Janet to be sure. But the call will have moved things on and that is good.

> Alwen, did you catch up with Janet? As you said, it is critical that we keep up the momentum from the
call: narrowing back down ss to the ToR is urgent - je., James’ letter. It might help if she realises
that unless the letter goes soon, Janes won't get his interim meeting in time.

> Can you confirm by return what you see as next steps by who/when for the different parts to this jinc.,
stakeholders, so we can be clear by end of today?

Thanks again,

Paula
