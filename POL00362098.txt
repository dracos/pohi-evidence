Dear Paula,

confirms that the requirements of this letter are compatible with the requirements on
State Aid of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union; and (ii) 1 April 2018
(the "Effective Date").

Existing Entrustment Letter

Notwithstanding the signing of this letter, in respect of the period prior to the Effective
Date, the provisions of the letter from the Government-to Post Office Limited entitled
"Entrustment of Post Office Limited with the delivery of certain public services" and
dated 23 January 2015 (the "Existing Entrustment Letter") shall continue in full

Entrustment

This letter contains an overarching ministerial instruction entrusting Post Office
Limited with the provision and delivery of certain services of general economic interest.
This instruction is legally binding on Post Office Limited and Post Office Limited has
signed this letter in agreement and acknowledgement of this.

(a) We contirm that Post Office Limited is under a public service obligation (as set
out here and also contractually in the Post Office Limited Funding Agreement
dated April 2018, (the "Funding Agreement")) to maintairi, from the
Effective Date until the end of its financial year ending on or around 31 March
2021, a network of post offices beyond its optimal commercial size (the
"Network SGEI"). That network must meet the following minimum access
requirements:

POL00362098

POL00362098
POL00362098

© Nationally, 99% of the UK population to be within 3 miles and 90% of
the population to be within 1 mile of their nearest post office outlet.

* 99% of the total population in deprived urban areas across the UK to be
within 1 mile of their nearest post office outlet.

", « 95% of the total urban population across the UK to be within 1 mile of
their nearest post office outlet.

© 95% of the total rural population across the UK to be within 3 miles of
their nearest post office outlet,

In addition, the following criterion will apply at the level of each and every
individual postcode district, establishing a minimum level of coverage at a very
local level.

¢ 95% of the population of the postcode district to be within 6 miles of
their nearest post office outlet.

Post Office Limited is required to provide this network of post office branches to make
available the services of general economic interest detailed in Annex A ("Product
SGETI") on the basis set out in the Funding Agreement. This Network SGEI obligation
therefore extends the provision of the Product SGEI over a network -which may be
beyond that required under individual Product SGEI contracts entered into on a
commercial basis between Post Office Limited and relevant Government departmeits
or bodies (whether public or private). The delivery of the Product SGEI by Post Office
Limited across its network will be governed in accordance with contracts or other
agreements under which the terms of the provision of the individual product SGEI are

The entrustment of the delivery of the Network SGEI set out in this letter to Post Office
Limited does not replace or change in any way any contracts or other agreements under
which the terms of the provision of the individual Product SGEI are specified. Post
Office Limited is expected to use reasonable’ endeavours to enter into contracts with
Government departments or bodies (whether public or private) contracting with Post

Office Limited in respect of the provision of one or more Product SGEIs. A list of the ©

current individual contracts and agreements held by Post Office Limited to deliver the
Product SGEI is provided in Annex B.

Method of Calculating Compensation

As soon as reasonably practicable following publication of its audited accounts for the
Financial Year ending on or around 31 March 2021, Post Office Limited will be
tequited to provide, in accordance with the Funding Agreement, a statement (the
“Cumulative SGEI Statement"), The Cumulative SGEI Statement must be
accompanied by a supporting statement from an independent financial adviser, to
confirm that the aggregate amount of the SGEI compensation payments made by the
Government to Post Office Limited under the Funding Agreement (the "Cumulative
SGEI Payment") did not exceed the difference between the actual net costs incurred
by Post Office Limited and the net profits that would have been incurred in connection

POL00362098
POL00362098

POL00362098
POL00362098

with the provision of a network that Post Office Limited would maintain on a purely
commercial basis (as specified by the relevant European Commission decision(s)),
during the financial years covered by the Funding Agreement (the "Cumulative SGEL
Cost").

This is to be calculated using the net avoided cost methodology, in accordance with the
principles in paragraphs 21-32 of the 2012 Community Framework for State aid in the
form of public service compensation (“Framework”) and in precedent Commission
decisions, which calculates the SGEI net cost as the difference between:

the expected net cost for POL when providing the SGEIs; and

© the expected net cost / profit for POL when operating without any SGEI
obligations,

For the purposes of this net avoided cost methodology the costs shall include, without
limitation, all variable and fixed costs associated with delivery of the SGEIs including
contributions to pension funds, interest costs, central costs, depreciation and
amortisation costs of any employee incentivisation arrangements and the costs of
transforming the network, in each case whether such costs are recurring or exceptional.

Recovery of Overpayment

Notwithstanding clause 5.3 of the Funding Agreement, in the event that the Cumulative
SGEI Payment exceéds the Cumulative SGEI Cost, Post Office Limited will be required
to repay to the Government, within 10 Business Days of'a request fiom the Government,
an amount equal to such excess.

It is possible that Post Office Limited may during the period of this entrustment cease
to provide an individual Product SGEI, the provision of which over the post office
network beyond its optimal commercial size is compensated by the Government. In
those circumstances, the Government may in its absolute discretion, provided that the
provision of the Network SGEI will be maintained, withhold such reasonable
proportion of that compensation (if any) which corresponds to the net direct costs of
providing that Product SGEI.
