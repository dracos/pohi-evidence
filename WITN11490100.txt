The importance of resolving Post Office issues

15.

One of the Labour Government's key manifesto commitments was to ensure that

justice and compensation are delivered as swiftly as possible for every sub-

postmaster caught up in the Horizon scandal. Though my ministerial portfolio is

wide, work to support the victims of the Horizon scandal, accelerate fair

compensation, and improve the position of sub-postmasters over the long term,

is at the top of my agenda.

In the 2 months since my appointment, I have received regular written and oral
briefings, plus regular submissions from officials. I exhibit DBT Post Office
Briefing 16 July 2024 — Deep Dive 1: Post Office Redress (BEIS0000939), Note on
Post Office Changes dated 30 August 2024 (BEIS0000942), Weekly Update:
Post Office Convictions dated 9 August 2024 (BEIS0000941), and Ministerial
Submission — Publication of Horizon Redress Scheme Reports dated 25 July 2024
(BEIS0000940) to provide a general sense.

We regularly discuss issues relating to Horizon redress and the future of the Post Office
at departmental ministerial meetings, and I have held a number of useful and
informative meetings with postmasters, Parliamentary colleagues and other important
stakeholders including:
e Jo Hamilton: 24 July Readout of meeting between Minister Thomas and Jo
Hamilton dated 24 July 2024 (BEISO000948)
e Lord Arbuthnot: 25 July Readout of meeting between Minister Thomas and
Lord Arbuthnot dated 25 July 2024 (BEISO000945)
e Nigel Railton (Post Office interim chair): 20 August
e Tony Downey and Neil Hudgell: 21 August Readout of meeting between
Minister Thomas, Tony Downey and Neil Hudgell dated 21 August 2024
(BEIS0000947)
e Kevin Hollinrake: 2 September
e Calum Greenhow (NFSP): 3 September Readout of meeting between
Minister Thomas and Calum Greenhow dated 3 September 2024
(BEIS0000949)
e Dave Ward (CWU): 4 September Readout of meeting between Minister
Thomas and Dave Ward dated 4 September 2024 (BEIS0000946)

As the Inquiry would expect, since my appointment our main focus has been on issues
of redress for postmasters and ensuring that the Post Office has the right model for the
future, in which the central role played by postmasters is recognised and

respected.

Redress

19. Iam concerned that fair compensation has not been paid to everyone deserving
of it as quickly as it should have been.

20. Since coming into government, we have already made a number of positive steps
to accelerate and improve the process of providing redress to postmasters, and
we are exploring additional options for the delivery of fair and timely

compensation for those affected.

21. On 25 July 2024, I gave my approval to the introduction of fixed sum awards

of £75,000 under the Horizon Shortfall Scheme, a decision which the Secretary of
State formally approved on 30 July 2024 Email from Secretary of State’s Private
Secretary dated 30 July 2024 RE: Ministerial Submission - Horizon Shortfall Scheme -
Fixed Sum Awards — OFFICIAL SENSITIVE (BEIS0000888). It is anticipated that this
will provide accelerated redress for many sub-postmasters, minimise stress and
difficulty, and enable more timely resolution of the claims of those sub- postmasters

who do not wish to accept the fixed sum award offered to them.

22. On 30 July 2024, the Secretary of State announced the launch of the Horizon
Convictions Redress Scheme Secretary of State oral statement to House of
Commons on 30 July 2024 (RLIT0000365). The Horizon System (Offences)
Act 2024 overturned the convictions of postmasters in England, Wales and
Northern Ireland. Similar legislation was passed in the Scottish Parliament.
Because the postmasters whose convictions were overturned in this way were
not eligible for compensation under the Overturned Convictions (OC”)
compensation scheme, it was clearly necessary to create a new scheme to
provide full and fair compensation to them. The scheme created for that
purpose is the Horizon Compensation Redress Scheme (“HCRS”). I refer the
Inquiry to the First statement of Carl Creswell (WITN11730100) for a
detailed explanation of the HCRS scheme and its mechanics and criteria.
The HCRS scheme is to be delivered by Department for Business and Trade

(“DBT”) in order to increase confidence, in

Page 5 of 10
WITN11490100
WITN11490100

line with the recommendations of the recent National Audit Office report titled
Lessons learned: Government Compensation Schemes, 5 July 2024
(RLIT0000366) and includes the option of a fixed sum award. The government
will pay the reasonable legal costs of applications under the scheme. Some of the
fine detail concerning the administration of this newly launched scheme, including
timeframes and governance and oversight arrangements, has not yet been

finalised and we will make further announcements as soon as possible.

23. On 25 July 2024, I agreed to the creation of an independent, DBT-administered
Horizon Shortfall Scheme (“HSS”) appeals mechanism Email from Minister
Thomas’ Private Secretary dated 25 July 2024 RE: Ministerial Submission -
Horizon Shortfall Scheme - HSS Appeals Mechanism - OFFICIAL SENSITIVE
(BEIS0000943), Submission to Minister Thomas for decision: Horizon Shortfall
Scheme Appeal Mechanism dated 24 July 2024 (BEIS0000944). This was
recommended by the Horizon Compensation Advisory Board, and is intended to
ensure that all HSS claimants, some of whom may have under-settled their
claims, will receive a fair level of redress. The Secretary of State approved this
course on 12 August 2024 Submission to Minister Thomas for decision: Horizon
Shortfall Scheme Appeal Mechanism dated 24 July 2024 (BEIS0000889) and
on 9 September 2024 he made a statement to Parliament in which he
announced the creation of this new appeals mechanism Secretary of State oral
statement to House of Commons 9 September 2024 (RLIT0000348).

Changing the Post Office

24. Itis clear that we need to find the right model for the Post Office. Before we come
to any conclusions on what that might look like, we want to draw on a range of

views and ideas.

25. DBT has given Nigel Railton, the Post Office’s interim chair, a mandate to
conduct a Strategic Review into the organisational culture, structure, resourcing
and operational processes within the Post Office, to be carried out in consultation

with postmasters. And, at the very start of his time as the new Secretary of State,

Jonathan Reynolds discussed possible options for the future shape of the Post
Office with Mr Railton Readout of meeting between Secretary of State and Nigel
Railton dated 9 July 2024 (BEIS0000887), which he then followed up in writing
Letter from Secretary of State to Nigel Railton dated 4 September 2024
(BEIS0000891). I have also met Mr Railton to have initial conversations on
these issues.

26. We have also commissioned independent experts to advise us on the best model
for the Post Office in future.

27. The Inquiry will also play a role in this process; we will pay careful regard to its
findings and recommendations touching on issues of Post Office culture, the Post
Office’s abusive relationship with postmasters, and the right corporate and

governance model for the Post Office.

28. We are determined to identify ways to strengthen the Post Office network, in
consultation with sub-postmasters, trade unions and customers. We will also
support the development of new products, services and business models, such

as banking hubs, to help modernise branches.

CONCLUSIONS

29. I welcome the decision to set up the Inquiry and am grateful for the considerable
work that has already been undertaken. I look forward to receiving its report and

recommendations, and am happy to provide the Inquiry with whatever further

assistance I can.
