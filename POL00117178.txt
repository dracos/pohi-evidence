All

T attach three documents:

- press notice

- letter to Jo Swinson MP

- letter to Adrian Bailey MP

These are core in the sense they are the most public documents we will be releasing. The Swinson letter will be tabled in Parliament
by BIS and is most urgent: once Paula is content it needs to be with BIS early on Monday. Apologies.

I would be grateful for your comments, preferably in email text rather than tracked changes.
Thave separately sent the Swinson letter to Paula.

In addition I tweaked the exec summary today, and have sent that too to Alice and Paula. Mark U has latest version. It removes the
VFM para - Alice has agreed to this.

Finally I will read the full report today or tomorrow.
Thanks all.

Mark
