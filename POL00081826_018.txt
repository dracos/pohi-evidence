Dear Mr Turner,

Thanks for your email of earlier today with suggested amended wording.

I note that you are seeking formal instructions on the original paragraph 2 and will await your
approval of the draft Tomlin order plus the draft wording of the letter Mr Castleton requires
hopefully later today and then deal with this in the round.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Yours sincerely,

Dear Mr Dilley

Thank you for your e-mail below with draft order.

Whilst I have not yet been able to discuss it with him, I think it almost certain that the form of wording you
suggest at paragraph 2 will not acceptable to my client. I envisage that he would prepared to provide a letter
in the following terms:


"I, Mr Lee Castleton, the former subpostmaster at Marine Drive Post Office, Bridlington, fully
and unreservedly withdraw the allegations I have made about the operation of the Horizon
system. I undertake not to repeat those allegations and/or make any further allegations about
the Horizon system and/or its functioning."

This provides your client with the formal confirmation that it requires.

I will revert to you later today on the form of wording for the reciprocal letter to be provided by your client.

        Without prejudice

        Dear Mr Turner,

        I refer to our telephone conversation this afternoon.

        1. I attach a draft consent order for your approval.

        2. The wording of the letter from Mr Castleton to the Post Office referred to in
        paragraph 4 of the Tomlin Order shall read:


        "I, Mr Lee Castleton, the former subpostmaster at Marine Drive Post Office,
        Bridlington, fully and unreservedly withdraw the untrue allegations I have made
        about the operation of the Horizon system. Previously I thought that losses that
        arose at the Marine Drive Post Office whilst I was subpostmaster arose due to a
        malfunction of the Horizon system, but I now accept that I was mistaken and that
        the losses were caused by human error. I declare that the Horizon system did not
        cause or contribute to the losses in any way and I formally withdraw all statements
        I made to the contrary and undertake not to repeat them, and/or make any further
        allegations about the Horizon system and/or its functioning."

        3. I suggest you provide us with a draft form of wording for us to consider for the
        letter Mr Castleton seeks about no dishonesty allegation being made (as per pars 3
        of the Schedule to the Order)

        4. As discussed:

        (a) any settlement is not finalised until agreed in writing in the form of a signed
        order;

        (b) Our Counsel's deemed brief fee will not be incurred on Monday, strictly provided
        that a final settlement order is agreed within the next few days. However, we have
        previously agreed with Counsel that if settlement occurs before that time, Counsel
        will be paid on an hourly basis for preparatory work done so far and any further
        work. Therefore, it is preferable from a costs point of view if an order is finalised

          sooner rather than later; and

           (c) We are ready, willing and able to exchange witness statements but given the
           parties are now focusing on settlement, do not propose to send them to you today.

          I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.

Dear Mandy,

Please see below. Are you content with that suggested wording of Castleton's letter? Its not
quite as strong as our wording, but if Castleton wants to enter the city, I didn't think he'd like
our suggested wording for the same reason that he prefers a Tomlin order to a judgment.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Kind regards.

      Dear Sirs

     Post Office Limited —v- Mr L Castleton

      We refer to our conversation yesterday. We have now received via our counsel your client's response to the
      offer made by counsel to your counsel on 8 November.

      Our client would be prepared to settle this claim on the following terms:

                  The terms of settlement are embodied in a Tomlin Order rather than a judgment, given that a judgment
                  may well impact on our client's ability to re-enter the financial services sector in due course. An
                  obligation to pay set out in the Schedule to the Order would be readily convertible into a judgment by
                  your client pursuant to the liberty to apply as to implementation provision, if required.

      2.          The Defendant will pay the amount of the claim, £25,858.95, in full.

      3.          Interest will be payable from 23 March 2004 to date and continuing to pay at 1% above base rate
                  applicable during the period (or such other rate over base rate at which your client is able to borrow).

      4.          The Defendant will pay the Claimant's costs to be assessed if not agreed (except as otherwise ordered):

                  4.1              on the standard basis to 26 January 2006 (i.e. to 21 days after the date of your client's
                                   purported Part 36 offer letter); and

                  4.2              on the indemnity basis from 26 January 2006 onwards

      5.          The Defendant will make a payment on account of costs of £30,000.

      6.          There be an exchange of letters as previously discussed, viz:

                  6.1              The Post Office sets out that there no allegation of dishonesty is or has been made against Mr
                                   Castleton and that these proceedings were simply a claim for him to make good a shortfall in
                                   the accounts of the Post Office's branch at Marine Drive pursuant to his contractual
                                   obligations;

                  6.2              Mr Castleton sets out that he withdraws his allegations in relation to the Horizon system.

                  Payment to be made within 21 days. The reason for this rather than the 14 days which we understand
                  that your counsel indicated to our counsel is that our client is in the process of arranging a re-mortgage
                  and it may be that funds will not be available within the 14 day period.

Tin relation to the offer set out in your letter of 5 January 2006, we note that it does not strictly speaking
 comply with the requirements of Part 36 since it was expressed as a lump sum settlement figure which was
 incl~'^eve of costs. Your client cannot therefore be certain that it will attract the costs consequences of a true
 Pars.    offer (although we do recognise that the court has a discretion in this regard and that it can take it into
 account).

The above proposal gives your client almost everything that it seeks. We hope that your client will view it as a
constructive attempt to bring these proceedings to a resolution at least further cost, bearing in mind the
proximity of trial and the costs which would necessarily be incurred over the coming weeks if it should
proceed.

We would invite you in light of this proposal to seek to agree with your client's counsel that the first tranche
of his brief fee be delayed from next Monday to allow settlement discussions to proceed without further
substantial costs accruing.

  ours faithfully
Y
ROWE COHEN

The court has asked us     produce a trial timetable. So that we can do so, please confirm which of our
                                    #o




witness statements yo' require to attend the trial to be cross examined. We anticipate that you will not
require all of the witnesses for examination, not least because 7 of them were not involved at the material
time and their evidetce relates to Post Office procedures. Obviously if we can reduce the number of
witnesses who have to attend trial to give evidence, then this will save both parties and the court's time
and costs.

We look forwar1 to receiving your reply, together with your witness statements, as agreed, in today's DX.

I had a telephone conversation with Richard Morgan. He confirmed he had put her offer to
them. They didn't sound terribly impressed with this. There were two points arising:

    1. What rate of interest did we want or the judgment debt for example would we
       accept l% over base.

    2.   What payment on account do we want if we get indemnity costs.

I said I would seek instructions from Mandy. Also agreeing with Richard that the Post Office
needed to move down from £186,000 on its costs position. Richard advising me to put our
witness statements in the DX even though they probably wouldn't send theirs and that once
we had released them we should call them and ask them if they had sent theirs and if they
had not, we should tell them to hold ours to our order and we should consider making an
application. I told Richard I would also be interested to see what their experts report said as
that was due today.

Anything under user name ABC123 and Zaud99 would have been by the auditors either myself or Chris. So I
would say the office did not open at all on the 23rd, all transactions on the 23rd were completed between 14:39
and
17:19 and look to be related to completing the account ready for transfer.
I can only think that by 14:39 we had been told that the Postmaster was going to be suspended and from then on
we would access the Horizon. As you can see we would not have touched the Horizon prior to knowing of the
suspension as we would balance the office on our own system. P32. Once we
were told of a suspension and transfer then we would ensure that the Horizon and P32 were correct by removing
any amounts in the suspense account and posting total shortage to late account.

The temp postmaster took over and started serving in the morning of the 24th RSI001.

Dear Helen,

I refer to our telephone conversation yesterday.

I know you don't remember whether the branch opened on 23 March (but doubt it would do), and I was
wondering whether the event log for that day (pdf copy attached) plus product codes (attached excel
spreadsheet) could assist? It may be that the events recorded were all audit related, but I was wondering if you
could confirm either way.

I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.

Kind regards.

                   I
             Draft Tomlin Order
              10th Novemb...
                                   Dear Mandy,

  Thanks for your email.

    1. I don't think Mr Castleton will want quite as plainly to admit owing the P.O money, for the same reason he
    doesn't want a judgment being entered against him. We can try to get him to say that if you want, but I doubt he
    will. I wonder if we can change it to:

  °I, Mr Lee Castleton, the former postmaster at Marine Drive Post Office, Bridlington, fully and unreservedly
  withdraw the untrue allegations I have made about the operation of the Horizon system. Previously I thought that
  discrepancies that arose at the Marine Drive Post Office whilst I was subpostmaster arose due to a malfunction of
  the Horizon system, but I now accept that I was mistaken and that the discrepancies were caused by human
  error. I declare that the Horizon system did not cause or contribute to the discrepancies in any way and I formally
  withdraw all statements I made to the contrary and undertake not to repeat them, and/or make any further
  allegations about the Horizon system and/or its functioning."

  2. I attach a draft consent order for your approval. The real question is whether we need the undertaking in
  clause 5 of the schedule. Richard thinks that by making a song and dance we highlight a sensitivity and that the
  less we talk about it, the less likely it is that Castleton will seek to raise it, because raising the issue in itself calls
  into question his reasons for settling. Also,

  (i) the loss figure is purely speculative
  (ii) we wonder the P.O want to police it in any event; and
  (iii) the letter along the above lines would probably discredit Castleton enough if he did give make further
  allegations or give evidence in the Bajaj, Bilkhu or any other cases.

     I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.

     Kind regards.

Mandy,

I think the draft says all that it needs to.

I have a few minor changes to suggest - revised text as follows:

"I Mr Lee Castleton the former postmaster at Marine Drive Post Office, Bridlington admit that a sum of money
was owed by me to Post Office Ltd as a result of errors which arose whilst I was the postmaster at the above
office. I had thought that this debt arose due to a malfunction of the HORIZON system but I now accept that I
was mistaken and that the debt arose out of human error. I declare that the HORIZON system did not contribute
to the errors in any way and formally withdraw all statements I made to the contrary."

and redlined against your draft....

"I Mr LLee Castleton the former postmaster at Marine Drive Post Office, Bridlington admit that a sum of money
was owed by me to Post Office Ltd as a result of errors which arose whilst I was the postmaster at the above
office. I had thoughthought that this debt arose due to a malfunction of the HORIZON system but I knownow
accept that I was mistaken and that the debt arose out of human error. I declare that the HORIZON system did

You will all be pleased to know that the solicitors acting for Castleton have substantially accepted our counter
proposal. I attach a copy of their letter.

Castleton is not prepared to have judgement entered against him because he claims it would prejudice his future
career prospects and so the claim will be settled by way of a Tomlin Order. This means that if anybody searched
the Court records all they would see is a record that the claim was resolved but the detail of the same is kept
private.

Castleton is prepared to make an open statement that POL can use as it chooses exonerating the HORIZON
system. I now need your assistance over the form of wording that POL would like to see in that statement.

I have prepared a short statement but would be very grateful for any improvements which you can suggest. We
need to have a settled form of words to go back to Castleton's solicitors as soon as possible. This settlement is
still without prejudice and does not formally conclude the action until it is signed so we must endeavour to get it
signed as soon as possible.

"I Mr L Castleton the former postmaster at Marine Drive Post Office admit that a sum of money was owed by me
to Post Office Ltd as a result of errors which arose whilst I was the postmaster at the above office. I had though
that this debt arose due to a malfunction of the HORIZON system but I know accept that I was mistaken and that
the debt arose out of human error. I declare that the HORIZON system did not contribute to the errors in any way
and formally withdraw all statements I made to the contrary."

Stephen,
Please find attached my suggested revisions to the draft Terms of Order, for review. I have drafted a bit more
into clause 5 of the schedule in order to give it some teeth, but only by way of example, and I wonder whether
it is really necessary or appropriate? I say this because (i) the loss figure is purely speculative and (ii) I doubt
whether we want to police it in any event. Further, by making a song and dance we highlight a sensitivity.
The reality I suspect is that the less we talk about it, the less likely it is that Castleton will seek to raise it, since
raising the issue in itself calls into question his reasons for settling.
In the circumstances I would suggest that the whole of clause 5 of the schedule is omitted.
All the best,
Richard

     Subject:      P.O's counterproposal to Mr Castleton
     Attachments: LFORM 1153255.PDF

    Dear Mandy,

    Just to confirm Richard has put our without prejudice counter offer to Mr Castleton's barrister
    i.e:

    1. Judgment against Mr Castleton for full amount of claim of £25,858.95 plus interest;
    2. Payment of costs £186,000, or our costs to be assessed on an indemnity basis with a
    substantial up front payment on account of an amount to be agreed.
    3. Castleton resolves rent position directly with Dorothy Day (current subpostmistress);
    4. P.O don't employ assistants in the P.O branches, so payment of Christine Train's is for Mr
    Castleton and Dorothy Day to resolve i.e P.O is not going to get involved;
    5. P.O to prepare letter in wording to be agreed that it doesn't allege dishonesty vs Mr
    Castleton;
    6. Castleton to prepare letter/statement in wording to be agreed that he withdraws all
    allegations about Horizon; and
    7. Payment of above sums within 14 days.

    They are taking instructions but apparently didn't sound too impressed. I think costs may be a
    sticking point at the moment. I anticipate the P.O's view is that the most important thing is to
    get judgment for the full amount (to send out a clear message) and to negotiate the best
    possible costs recovery in the circumstances in the knowledge however, that

    (i) If we go to trial and win, a costs capping order may be made and costs reduced significantly
    on assessment; and
    (ii) (more significantly) in any event Castleton may not have sufficient funds to pay any costs
    award made against him.

    However, as I explained to Richard, we told them what the costs would be months ago, so they
    shouldn't be surprised. Also, they turned down our ADR offer and could have saved costs by
    settling earlier, so they've only got themselves to blame. Just a few points for you to consider:

    (a) What rate of interest would the P.O want on the judgment debt - would the P.O be prepared
    to accept 1% over base?

    (b) If Castleton agrees to pay indemnity costs to be assessed, what payment on account would
    the P.O seek pending the assessment? Should we say £100,000?

    (c) On 17 January 2006, Rowe Cohen rejected the P.O's CPR Part 36 offer to accept payment of
    £24,750 in full and final settlement of the claim and counterclaim, including interest and
    costs. However as you know the Court rules allow Mr Castleton to accept that Part 36 offer now
    provided either he agrees costs with us, or he gets the Court's permission (in which case the
    Court would make an order as to costs). If Mr Castleton decides to do this, the P.O would at
    least get more in relation to the claim than £22,350 (his opening offer). In that event, I would
    also expect the Court to order Mr Castleton to pay the P.O's costs from around 17 January
    onwards, to be assessed if not agreed. There would be argument whether this would be on the
    standard or indemnity basis. Mr Castleton's lawyers have not raised this possibility (it may not
    yet have occurred to them), but we should just be aware of it.

                                                                                       POL00081826_018

                                                                                       Page 2 of 2



(d) The difference between Castleton's proposal to pay £22,350 and the full amount of the
claim is just over £3,500. From now to trial, on a rough estimate I can see the P.O easily
incurring further costs of approximately £130,000 (Bond Pearce, expert and Counsel). Even if
the P.O wins and is awarded costs without a capping order, its costs would be assessed and on
assessment the P.O may be awarded 60% to 70% of its costs. This could mean that the
irrecoverable element of just those costs that are incurred between now and the end of
trial could easily be around £40,000. This would more than cancel out any "gain" of the extra
£3,500 the P.O might make if it gets judgment. Of course, balanced against this is that there
would be a significant commercial advantage to the P.O to having a reasoned judgment in its
favour: it would send out a clear message to other subpostmasters.

(e) Richard gets the impression (and it is only that) that Castleton will personally have to fund
any settlement. Accordingly, whether settlement is reached may well depend on what funds
Castleton can raise. Just a reminder about the asset check we previously did (copy attached)
showed that Mr and Mrs Castleton jointly own 14 South Marine Drive Bridlington and that they
purchased it for £218,000, in October 2003 with a Royal Bank of Scotland mortgage. Mr and
Mrs Castleton also own a motor vehicle, but the make and model are unknown. Given that Mr
and Mrs Castleton purchased the property with the assistance of a mortgage 2 and a half years
ago, there may not be a great deal of equity, but we do not have sufficient information to
determine this. If you want, I can have our agent make enquiries to as to how much the
building at Marine Drive would currently be worth, as it may have increased in value from
£218,000. In my experience, you only tend to get a rough figure from these sorts of enquiries,
but it might be helpful to have an indication because it would show the approximate minimum
equity and thus, what Castleton might at a minimum be able to afford to pay the P.Q.

I will update you when we get Mr Castleton's response to the counter offer.

Kind regards.

I had a telephone conversation with Richard Morgan and Mandy Talbot in relation to a fax
received from Rowe Cohen solicitors this afternoon with their counter proposal. All of us
agreeing that it was a really good result for the Post Office. Basically the real question is
whether we should go back on trying to increase the initial payment of account and Mandy
thinks not, that we should stick with £30,000. The other substantial point is as far as the
Post Office are concerned, the Tomlin Order point and Mandy is willing to agree to that and
Richard pointed out that the other side hadn't agreed to a confidentiality clause in it.

Agreeing with Mandy that we will draw up a Tomlin Order for her approval and that I will
stand down BDO Stoy Hayward from doing any further work. Richard suggesting that Mandy
prepares the wording of the letter to come from Castleton stating that he makes no
allegations about Horizon.

Time engaged: 24 minutes.

Thereafter I had a telephone conversation with Mark Turner of Rowe Cohen solicitors. I
explained that the telephone conversation was on a without prejudice basis and that the
discussions between counsel had so far also been on that basis as opposed to a without
prejudice save as to costs basis.

I stated that the Post Office was going to focus on settlement at the moment rather than the
trial. I said that any settlement would not be binding until agreed and recorded in a signed
Consent Order. He agreed. I said that the cost points in the Consent Order needed to be
dealt with in the man bit rather than in the schedule to the Order. He agreed.

I said that our counsel's briefing would not be incurred on        strictly provided that a
                                                           Monday




final settlement is agreed within the next few days, but that counsel was going to be
charging on an hourly rate for all the work done so far.

I also said that we are ready to exchange Witness Statements but given that we are now
focusing on settlement,      did not propose to send them in the DX.
                            and




He was relieved that the briefing would not be deemed incurred on Monday. I said that in
principle we had the making of a settlement agreement. What I would do is prepare a
Tomlin Order and send it to my client for approval this afternoon and then send it to him. He
asked me to copy in his counsel as well and explained that he would be away from the office
on Monday.

Time engaged: 12 minutes.

I had a telephone conversation with Jeff Porter at BDO Stoy Hayward. Asking him not to do
any further work for the moment. Explaining that a settlement was being reached in
principle and was not finalised yet, but that we were working towards settling rather than
trial. I said that I thought the terms would be finalised in the middle of next week at which
point I would ask him to raise an invoice and submit it, but that it would need to fully explain
what they had been doing and how their time was broken down because this would need to
be dependable on a cost assessment. I also thanked him for his work.

Time engaged: 12 minutes.

I had a telephone conversation with Richard at 4.15pm in relation to the wording of the
Order he had e-mailed through to me as amended, especially paragraph 2 — did we want to
say we had liberty to enter judgement and he agreed with me that we probably didn't for the
same reason that Mr Castleton wouldn't consent to having judgement entered against him.
He also thinks that we should remove paragraph 5 of the schedule that he had added on.

Time engaged: 12 minutes.

  Attachments: eCopy scanned document.pdf

Dear Mandy,

I refer to my earlier email.

I attach Mr Castleton's counter offer and am pleased to confirm this is more or less a total
collapse on their side. I will call you to discuss shortly. Just a few points really:

1. Castleton to pay debt of £25,858.95 in full plus interest at 1% above base for applicable
period

2. Castleton to pay costs on standard basis up to 26 January 2006 (21 days after the P.O's CPR
part 36 offer) and indemnity basis after that date.

3. They want a Tomlin Order rather than a judgment (which means the settlement terms are
more confidential. This is so that Castleton can re-enter the financial services sector). Given
that Castleton is to withdraw his allegations vs Horizon, you might not consider that this is a
sticking point, but we should discuss the implications.

4. He's offered costs to make initial payment on account of costs of £30,000. I think we should
go back with say £80,000 but settle at £50,000 for the initial payment.

5. It would still be neater and quicker to try to agree costs rather than get them assessed and I
think we should invite Castleton to make an offer on this, but this should not be a sticking
point.

I will contact you shortly.

Kind regards.

                                                                                                                        Without prejudice except as to costs

        Dear Sirs

       Post Office Limited -v- Mr L Castleton

       We refer to our conversation yesterday. We have now -received via our counsel your client's response to the
       offer made by counsel to your counsel on 8 November.

       Our client would be prepared to settle this claim on the following terms:

        l.         The teams of settlement are embodied in a Tomlin Order rather than a judgment, given that a judgment
                   may well impact on our client's ability to re-enter the financial services seer in due course. An
                   obligation to pay set out in the Schedule to the Order would be readily convertible into a judgment by
                   your client pursuant to the liberty to apply as to implementation provision, if required.

       2.          The Defendant will pay the amount of the claim, £25S58.95, in full.

       3.         Interest will be payable from 23 March 2004 to date and continuing to pay at 1% above base rate
                  applicable during the period (or such other rate over base rate at which your client is able to borrow),

       4.          The Defendant will pay the Claimant's costs to be assessed if not agreed (except as otherwise ordered):

                  4,1             on the standard basis to 26 January 2006 (i.e. to 21 days after the date of your client's
                                  purported Part 36 offer letter); and

                  4.2             on the indemnity basis from 26 January 2006 onwards

       5.         The Defendant will make a payment on account of costs of £30,000.

       6.         There be an exchange of letters as previously discussed, viz:

                  6.1             The Post Office sets out that there no allegation of dishonesty is or has been grade against Mr
                                  Castleton and that these proceedings were simply a claim for him to make good a shortfall in
                                  the accounts of the Post Office's branch at Marine Drive pursuant to his contractual
                                  obligations;

                  6.2             Mr Castleton sets out that he withdraws his allegations in relation to the Horizon system.

       7.         Payment to be made within 21 days. The reason for this rather than the 14 days which we understand
                  that your counsel indicated to our counsel is that our client is in the process of nrrangthg a re-mortgage
                  and it may be that f=unds will not be available within the 14 day period.

       In relation to the offer set out in your letter of 5 January 2006, we note that it does not strictly speaking
       comply with the requirements of Part 36 since it was expressed as a lump sum settlement figure which was
       inclusive ofcosts. Your client cannot therefore be certain that it will attract the costs consequences of a true
       Part 36 offer (although we do recognise that the court has a discretion in this regard and that it can take it into
       account).

       The above proposal gives your client almost everything that it seeks. We hope that your client will view it as a
       constructive attempt to bring these proceedings to a resolution at least farther cost, bearing in mind the
       proximity of trial and the costs which would necessarily be incurred over the coming weeks ifit should
       proceed.

       We would invite you in light of this proposal to seek to agree with your client's counsel that the first tranche
       of his brief fee be delayed from next Monday to allow settlement discussions to proceed without further
       substantial costs accruing.

       Yours faithfully

Without prejudice

Dear Mr Turner,

I refer to our telephone conversation this afternoon.

1. I attach a draft consent order for your approval.

2. The wording of the letter from Mr Castleton to the Post Office referred to in paragraph 4 of
the Tomlin Order shall read:


"I, Mr Lee Castleton, the former subpostmaster at Marine Drive Post Office, Bridlington, fully
and unreservedly withdraw the untrue allegations I have made about the operation of the
Horizon system. Previously I thought that losses that arose at the Marine Drive Post Office
whilst I was subpostmaster arose due to a malfunction of the Horizon system, but I now accept
that I was mistaken and that the losses were caused by human error. I declare that the Horizon
system did not cause or contribute to the losses in any way and I formally withdraw all
statements I made to the contrary and undertake not to repeat them, and/or make any further
allegations about the Horizon system and/or its functioning."

3. I suggest you provide us with a draft form of wording for us to consider for the letter Mr
Castleton seeks about no dishonesty allegation being made (as per para 3 of the Schedule to
the Order)

4. As discussed:

(a) any settlement is not finalised until agreed in writing in the form of a signed order;

(b) Our Counsel's deemed brief fee will not be incurred on Monday, strictly provided that a final
settlement order is agreed within the next few days. However, we have previously agreed with
Counsel that if settlement occurs before that time, Counsel will be paid on an hourly basis for
preparatory work done so far and any further work. Therefore, it is preferable from a costs
point of view if an order is finalised sooner rather than later; and

(c) We are ready, willing and able to exchange witness statements but given the parties are
now focusing on settlement, do not propose to send them to you today.

I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.

Stephen Dilley

I had a telephone conversation with Mandy Talbot in relation to the draft Order that I had e-
mailed to her. Basically agreeing that in paragraph 5 of the schedule, we would delete the
words after the word functionality. Also agreeing with her that in relation to the e-mail that I
had sent to her about the wording of the letter from Mr Castleton, we would substituted the
word "losses" for the word "discrepancies". Discussing with her the problems of enforcing
any Order at paragraph 5 that Richard had put in and the possible risk of going over the top
ie flagging it up as an issue for Castleton. Mandy agreeing.

Time engaged: 12 minutes.

Dear Simon,

By way of update I am pleased to confirm that Mr Castleton's case has collapsed 3 weeks
before trial. Under pressure from us, they have made a revised offer (copy attached) which is
in principle (subject to some tweaking) acceptable to the P.O. This is an excellent outcome for
the P.O because the deal is:

1. Castleton to pay debt of £25,858.95 in full plus interest at 1% above base for applicable
period;

2. Castleton to pay costs on standard basis up to 26 January 2006 (21 days after the P.O's CPR
part 36 offer) and indemnity basis after that date, with an initial on account payment of £30k.
This is a major win as the costs are considerable.

3. Castleton to withdraw all allegations about Horizon (letter to be agreed).

Mandy is delighted. I understand she's in Soton on Monday, so timing is great.

Kind regards.

   Subject: P.O -v- Castleton

Dear Geoff,

I refer to my earlier voice mail message.

It appears as though we have the makings of an excellent settlement, in principle, with Mr
Castleton's solicitors. It is not signed up yet, but we anticipate that it will be within the next
few days. Please can I therefore ask BDO to cease all work on the matter for the time being.

Please could you also give me a call to discuss? Assuming the settlement is formalised, I'd like
BDO to raise a bill for all work to date, but as the P.O's costs will be assessed, the bill will need
to include a full narrative and time breakdown so that we can defend it on an assessment.

Finally, please can I thank you and your team for all the work you have put into this, at short
notice. It is very much appreciated.

Kind regards.
