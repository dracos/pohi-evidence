IT

The outsourcing of Post Office Limited's (POL) IT
function to a third party service provider (Fujitsu)
creates a degree of complexity and difficulty for
POL in gaining assurance that there are adequate
IT general controls in place around POL’s business
critical systems. This is further complicated by the
changes within Fujitsu's support structure whereby
certain functions within the RMGA business unit
have been further outsourced internally to shared
services provided by Fujitsu. This second layer of
the outsourcing arrangement further increases the
complexity and difficulty of gaining assurance that
adequate IT general controls are in place and
operate effectively. Despite the outsourced IT.
environment, POL is responsible for the’
governance, risk and control framework.over its
business critical systems, and should have visibility
and assurance over their design and operating
effectiveness.

Whilst we do recognise that the current
outsourcing model has been’pursued to
successfully deliver.very significant
commercial benefits to POL, there is a
need to implement additional governance
measures to reflect the shared service
nature of Fujitsu’s provision. We
recommend that POL's approach to this
should include the following:

, POL should take ownership of the
effectiveness of the control
environment with Fujitsu, requiring
Fujitsu to implement a control
framework devised by POL (including
standards and requirements) and to
provide assurance (independent or
otherwise) over its continued effective
operation

e Whilst Fujitsu has indicated that the
provision of an ISAE 3402 (formerly
SAS70) report would be excessively
costly and the preference within POL
at present is to focus on improving the
existing audit process going forward,
POL should keep the ISAE 3402
option under consideration over time,
as there are indications that Fujitsu
will adopt an increasingly global
approach to service provision, further

Work on improving the governance
of outsourcing with Fujitsu has
already commenced and we have
already established an approach.
Regular meetings underway and
plans to share the approach with
E&Y by July 2011.

Application of control reviews will be
monitored through an Audit Control
Governance Board fed by the
regularly scheduled embedded BAU
interactions with Fujitsu. This
governance board to be established
by July 2011

Monitoring controls and measures
will be defined between POL and
Fujitsu for embedded BAU
management purposes.

There is an increased risk of
inappropriate/unauthorised programme changes
being migrated to production if there are
inappropriate users with access to deploy and/or
users are granted with access to both develop and
deploy into production. This risk of
inappropriate/unauthorised changes remaining
undetected is enhanced as there is no control in
place to perform an independent periodic review of
a system generated list of all changes migrated into
the POLSAP and HNGxX production environment to
determine that changes have been authorised,
tested and approved prior to migration.

We reviewed the processesimplemented to
determine that problems.and incidents are
identified, resolved, reviewed and analysed in a
timely manner for all in-scope applications. Our
examination ofjthese processes revealed the
following:

Management should consider a regular
review of the problem and incident
management process to ensure that
problems and incidents are correctly
classified and resolved in a timely
manner.

Agreement of the classification and
timescales for the identification,

Credence we noted several users with
administrator rights, including some
generic users (this is noted below as a

access rights to create and amend
reports, including those which may be
relied upon for audit evidence. These
users can change report design, and

accounts has not been used since
April 2009.

3. The process for requesting and

Credence does not maintain

Management should enhance
password controls on the
Credence web portal to the same
standards applied to other Post
Office environments.
Management should consider
disabling generic administrator
accounts, or.assigning the
accounts to specific individuals to
ensure accountability over the
use of the administrator accounts.

Management should consider
establishing user administration
controls which are in-line with the
processes used for other Post
Office applications.

Users are not generic, but
role accounts which are
allocated to individuals and
for which an audit trail is
available. The correct
procedure to be followed for
the allocation and use of
these roles is being re-
emphasised. A full risk
assessment of the Credence
system is being undertaken
later this year and this aspect
will be reviewed.
