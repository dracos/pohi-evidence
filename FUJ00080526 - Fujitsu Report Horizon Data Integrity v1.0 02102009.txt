2 Horizon Data Integrity

The Horizon system is designed to store all data locally on the counter’s hard disk. Once the data has
been successfully stored there it is then replicated (copied) to the hard disks of any other counters in the
branch (and in the case of a single counter branch to the additional external storage on the single
counter). Data is also passed on from the gateway counter to the Horizon data centre using similar
mechanisms.

The replication process is designed such that should the data fail to be copied immediately (for example
due to a failure on the local IT network within the branch or another counter being switched off or the
branch being disconnected from the data centre), then further attempts are made to replicate the data at
regular intervals until it is finally copied successfully. Once the data reaches the Data Centre a further
copy is taken and added into the audit trail where it is available for retrieval for up to 7 years. Data in
the audit trail is “sealed” with a secure checksum that is held separately to ensure that it has not been
tampered with or corrupted.

Every record that is written to the transaction log has a unique incrementing sequence number. This
means it is possible to detect if any transitions records have been lost.

While a customer session is in progress, details of the transactions for that customer session are
normally held in the computer's memory until the customer session (often known as the “stack”) is
settled. At that point all details of the transactions (including any methods of payment used) are written
to the local hard disk and replicated (as described above). It should be noted that double entry
bookkeeping is used when recording all financial transactions, ie for every sale of goods or services,
there is a corresponding entry to cover the method of payment that has been used. When a “stack” is
secured it is written in such a way that either all the data is written to the local hard disk or none of it is
written. This concept of “atomic writes” is also taken into account when data is replicated to other
systems (ie other counters, external storage or the data centre).

The data for a stack will have been successfully secured to the local hard disk before the screen is
updated indicating that a new customer session can be started. Note that although an attempt will have
been made to replicate the data to an external system at this time, there is no guarantee at this point
that such replication will have been successful. For example if there is a Network Failure followed by a
Terminal failure there is a slight risk that transactions in the intervening period could be lost.

All data that is written includes a “checksum” value (known as a CRC) which is checked whenever the
data is read to ensure that it has not been corrupted. Any such corruptions detected on reading will
result in failures being recorded in the event logs which are held on the local hard disk for a few days for
immediate diagnosis and also immediately sent through to the data centre where they are held for 7
years.

Any failures to write to a hard disk (after appropriate retries) will result in the counter failing and needing
to be restarted and so will be immediately visible to the user.

Whenever data is retrieved for audit enquiries a number of checks are carried out:
1. The audit files have not been tampered with (ie the Seals on the audit files are correct)

2. The individual transactions have their CRCs checked to ensure that they have not been
corrupted.

3. A check is made that no records are missing. Each record generated by a counter has an
incremental sequence number and a check is made that there are no gaps in the sequencing.

3 Scenarios

It should be noted that these scenarios are all to do with equipment failures and these will always be
visible to Fujitsu through the event logs which are retained.

3.1 A counter fails

When a counter fails, there are two possible scenarios:

e Itcan be successfully restarted

e It cannot be successfully restarted, so needs to be physically replaced

In each case the Data Integrity considerations are different and so are described separately below.

Once the counter has been restarted (regardless of whether or not it has been replaced) recovery may
be carried out if recoverable transactions are detected on the counter. This is also discussed below.

3.1.1. The Counter is Successfully Restarted

In this case all the data that had been secured prior to the failure is still present on the counter and so is
available for use. If the User is in any doubt as to whether a transaction had been completed or not prior
to the failure they can use the transaction logs to confirm one way or the other.

3.1.2 The Counter is Physically Replaced

In this case there is no data on the local hard disk of the replacement counter. However, since the data
should have been replicated to other counters in the branch (or in the case of a single counter branch to
the external storage — which should have been physically moved to the replacement counter), then the
data should be retrieved and copied to the new counter. If for some reason the data were not available
locally in the branch, then it will be copied back from the data centre. This all happens automatically as
part of the counter replacement procedure.

Note that the hard disks are encrypted so there is no danger of data protection issues once the old
counter has been removed (or if it is stolen).

When a counter is physically replaced, there is a possibility that not all data has been successfully
replicated to another system prior to the failure. In this scenario it is essential that the user confirms
what the last successful transaction on that counter was, again by using the transaction logs.

3.1.3 Transaction Recovery

Some classes of transaction generate recovery data as they go along, so as to ensure that in the event
of a failure between the transaction starting and the basket being secured, there is sufficient information
available to enable the transaction to be recovered. On Horizon there are two separate mechanisms to
cover different classes of transaction:

e Banking Recovery
« AP Recovery

Both these mechanisms are automatically invoked during Log On, should the system detect that there
has been a possible failure. These are described below.

3.1.1.1. Banking Recovery

This covers credit card and debit card transactions and e-Top-Up transactions as well as online banking
transactions.

A check is carried out to see if any incomplete banking style transactions (i.e. network banking, credit /
debit card or e-Top-Up) exist in the transaction logs for that counter. An incomplete transaction is one
where an authorisation request has been sent to the financial institution, and there is no corresponding
completion message which is normally secured as part of settlement at the end of the Customer session.

In most cases, recovery information stored in the transaction log can be used to ascertain the outcome
of the transaction being recovered and a suitable completion record is then recorded at the time of
recovery. In some cases the user is prompted to confirm whether or not the transaction has completed
successfully and the response from that prompt is used to generate the completion record.

3.1.1.2 AP Recovery

In the case of Automated Payments (AP), the user is asked if they wish to carry out AP recovery and
they have the option of doing so immediately or leaving it until later.

If the user carries out recovery they will be asked about the last successful AP transaction (which can be
seen from the branch copies of the AP receipts that are printed) and the system will then check to see if
it has been completed in the system. If it has not been completed in the system, then the system will
use the AP Recovery data stored in the transaction logs to ensure that all incomplete AP transactions on
the counter up until the one specified by the user are completed at recovery time. To assist with this
process, each AP transaction has a unique, incrementing sequence number which is printed on the
receipt.

Fujitsu understand that these processes are defined in Post Office’s Horizon User Guides.

3.2 A counter has a "Blue Screen of Death"

This is just a special case of a counter failure, so please see section 3.1 above.

3.3 There are package collisions on networks

The replication protocols used to copy details of transactions between counters and also between the
gateway counter and the data centre ensure that the data is copied successfully. Should packets collide
on the network (or should there be any other network issues such as the IT communications link failing)
then the replication protocols will ensure that the data is re-sent. Such retries will continue until the data
is finally successfully transmitted.
