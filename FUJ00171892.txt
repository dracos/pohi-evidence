It is important that any duplicate messages in the retrieved audit data are highlighted to the user.

Duplicates are not being hightlighted when two message sequences have the same start and end message
sequence numbers.

ie. Sequences 2708181 to 2708188 and 2708181 to 2708188 would not be reported as duplicates.

Sequences 2708181 to 2708188 and 2708183 to 2708183 would report a duplicate.

This is a very serious issue. We experienced the presence of duplicate Horizon transactions which were not
removed when the HNG-X application was introduced. POL did not accept a manual workaround and the
ARQ service basically stopped for almost 2 months.

The issue contained in this PEAK came to light on 21 October and I have instigated the creation of a macro
which will identify if duplicated transactions are contained within a spreadsheet. We will need to generate
an additional spreadsheet containing the JVN and check for duplicates by using the macro. This will
increase our work load by 15-20 minutes for each ARQ containing HNG-X transaction records.

The real problem will arise if we do identify duplicate transactions because POL is not likely to accept a
workaround for transaction records used for litigation support.

incident Description:

this defect follows on from PCO194639.

tf two Audit Tracks contain exactly the same message sequence then these are not reported as duplicate messages.

li-e.

wdit Track A contains the message sequences 2708181 to 2708188 and

wdit Track B also contains the message sequences 2708181 to 2708188 then these messages are not reported as duplicates.

\dditionally, this is service impacting for the Prosecution & Litigation Service; POL will not accept a workaround relating to
litigation support so this fix needs to be tested and applied as a matter of urgency.

tested by opening a new slow ARQ, retrieving BRDB data and proceeding to the filtering stage. Then edit one of the retrieved
files in the EXTRACTED AT folder for this ARQ on the audit server so that there are two identical sequences of JSNs in the file.

then perform a filtering operation and view the message sequences on the ‘Validation and Query’ tab. The duplicate sequences
should be highlighted in blue.

Fixed in incremental baseline AUDIT EXTRACT CLT_0313_vo63-vo62.
