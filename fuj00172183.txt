Horizon Audit Spreadsheet Producing Duplicate Transactions.

While performing an audit retrieval for branch 072128 duplicate transactions have been found on 3 June 09. Initial analysis show:;
that duplicate records are held in 2 different audited TMS files.

The processing is done by QueryDLL.dll. The way it works is that it processes all the results in a given file building up an
internal table of transaction sequences for that file. Then at the very end of processing the file it dumps the internal table to
the RFIQueryFileSequence table. It does not cross check the transactions in one file against those in another file.

Two solutions are possible.

The "easy solution".

   each LransacLion is processed a Check is made in Lhe RFIQueryFileSequence Lable and it iL is already there Lhe LraiisacLiun is
ignored writing a warning to the query log. The problem with this solution is that a query needs to be made to the database for
every transaction

The   more difficult   solution'

                                                                                                                                                                                                                               FUJO0172183
The internal table which at the moment, is built, up on a per file basis is changed to being built up on a per query basis. 'Phe
check for duplicate transactions is then done within the internal table. This i.s a much more thorough approach hut will take much
more work.

    EFFORT IN MANDAYS:

Two solutions have been identified and explained in my previous response. The "easy solution" would take 2 days. The "more
difficult solution" will take 4 days. It is a matter of whether performance will be acceptable for the "easy solution" which
involves querying a database table for every single transaction. A test will need to be performed to see how long the database
query would take.

          ON USER:

   asionally duplicate tran:;acti.ons are listed in the spreadsheets produced and presented to court for prosecution cases. Thee;,:
