From Penny - In a nut shell the HNG-X application is not removing duplicate transactions (which may have
been recorded twice on the Audit Server) and they are appearing in the ARQ returns. For the old Horizon
application Riposte automatically removed duplicate entries. An initial analysis shows that one third of all
ARQ returns (since the new application has been in play) have duplicated transactions

[the processing is done by QueryDIL.dll. The way it works is that it processes all the results in a given file building up an
internal table of transaction sequences for that file. Then at the very end of processing the file it dumps the internal table to
the RFIQueryFileSequence table. It does not cross check the transactions in one file against those in another file.

two solutions are possible.
Ihe “easy solution".
@ each transaction is processed a check is made in the RFIQueryFileSequence table and if it is already there the transaction is

ignored writing a warning to the query log. The problem with this solution is that a query needs to be made to the database for
levery transaction.

the "more difficult solution".

FUJ00172183
FUJ00172183

fhe Internal table which at the moment is built up on a per file basis is changed to being built up on @ per query basis, The
check for duplicate transactions is then done within the internal table. This is a much more thorough approach but will take much
jore work.

DEVELOPMENT IMPACT OF FIX:

SPECIFY THE HNG-X PLATFORMS IMPACTS!

[the platform is the “Audit Server" and that has been entered.
IECHNICAL SUMMARY:

his change will affect QueryDLL.dll on the audit servers.

LIST OF KNOWN DIMENSIONS DESIGN PARTS AFFECTED BY THE CHANGE:
|AUDIT_EXTRACT_SVR

|ARE ANY OF THESE DESIGN PARTS AFFECTED BY APPROVED CPs/PEAKS in HNGX Release 2:

Yes. They are affected by CP0336. If the fix is targeted pre Release 2 then the PEAK will need to be cloned for a Release 2 fix
too.

RELEASE 2 IMPACT:
ves - see above.

DEPENDENCIES:

here are no particular dependencies.

DOES THE FIX REQUIRE ANY MANUAL, DEPLOYMENT BASELINES:

[fhe integration team will be able to turn this delivery into a fully automatic deployment.

DEV EFFORT IN MANDAYS:

two solutions have been identified and explained in my previous response. The “easy solution" would take 2 days. The "more
j4ifficult solution" will take 4 days. It is a matter of whether performance will be acceptable for the "easy solution” which

involves querying a database table for every single transaction. A test will need to be performed to see how long the database
jauery would take.

IMPACT ON USER:

ccasionally duplicate transactions are listed in the spreadsheets produced and presented to court for prosecution cases. These
can give the defence team grounds to question the evidence.

IMPACT ON OPERATIONS:
[there is no particular operational impact.

AVE RELEVANT KELS BEEN CREATED OR UPDATED?

jo KELs have been created for this since we Intend to fully resolve the issue shortly.

IMPACT ON HORIZON TO HNGX BRANCH MIGRATIONS

here is no particular migration effect.

IMPACT ON TEST:

loueries and filtering need to be done using TMS files with duplicate transactions within them.
InISKS (of releasing and of not releasing proposed fix):

if we do not fix this problem our spreadsheets presented in court are liable to be brought into doubt if duplicate transactions
are spotted.

I.ISt OF LIKELY DELIVERABLES:
loueryDiL.d11

List OF THE ABOVE ALREADY DELIVERED FOR THE PROPOSED RELEASE:

LIST OF THE ABOVE ALREADY DELIVERED TO A RELEASE LATER THAN THAT PROPOSED:

FUJ00172183
FUJ00172183

ueryDun.dnT
LIST OF THE ABOVE LIKELY TO BE REDELIVERED INTO THE PROPOSED OR A LATER RELEASE:

QueryDLL.dll is a recent component introduced for HNGx and has not yet fully bedded down and so it is likely to change as
jproblems such as this one are spotted.
