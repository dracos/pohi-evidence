3.0 Service Definition
The Third Line Software Support Service comprises the following:
a) Investigation of new software incidents

e The investigation, in accordance with operational procedures, of suspected new
software errors escalated from the Horizon Systems Help Desk and Systems
Management Centre.

b) Production of workarounds

e Following investigation of the software error, the production, where possible,
of a workaround which will enable the Branch to continue normal business in
line with relevant Processes and Procedures Descriptions or the data centre to
continue processing. Where a workaround requires a Branch to operate not in
accordance with relevant Processes and Procedures Descriptions, this will be
handled through the Service Management Service (CS/SER/014).

e The updating of entries on a support knowledge database.

e The provision to Fourth Line Support of sufficient information to enable
further diagnosis and the production of a software fix where appropriate.

c) Technical support to Data Centre Operations

e Provision of technical support to Data Centre Operations and to the Systems
Management Centre to assist in the resolution of operational incidents. This
will include resend of files to Post Office and Clients, in cases of errors in
Fujitsu Services software. In cases where a resend of a file is required for
reasons other than an error in Fujitsu Services software, another service (AP
Client File Resend Service (CS/SER/013)) is available.

d) Transaction recovery

¢ The recovery of transactions from Branches in circumstances where it has not
been possible to deploy the laptop emulator solution and hence the relevant
processor or processors have been recovered via the Engineer Service
(CS/SER/005) to a central site.

e) Support for Business Continuity testing

© Provision of technical support for scheduled business continuity tests undertaken in
line with the Business Continuity Framework (CS/SIP/002)
