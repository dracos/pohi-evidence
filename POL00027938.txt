3.5.2

3.5.3

In the event that:

(a) the outcome of paragraph 3.5.1 is that an HNG-X Requirement is
modified under the HNG-X Programme Requirements Change Control
Process to avoid an inconsistency with the HNG-X Migration
Assumptions and there is a consequent amendment needed to (i) any
Tasks or (ii) any Dependencies related to those Tasks; or

(b) there is any inconsistency between the HNG-X Migration Assumptions
and (i) any Tasks or (ii) any Dependencies related to those Tasks, then
to the extent that such inconsistency is identified before completion of
the Task referred to in the HNG-X Programme Plan as 'HNGXL2_0330'
(“High-level Design”),

such matters and any amendment necessary to the HNG-X Programme Plan
shall be dealt with under the Change Control Procedure with the intention that:

(c) such adjustment to the Charges for Project HNG-X as may be necessary
shall not include adjustment to any of the Price Thresholds; and

(d) neither Party shall be obliged to carry out such Tasks or Dependencies
to the extent of that inconsistency until an appropriate CCN has been
agreed by both Parties.

If the outcome of paragraph 3.5.1 is not that an HNG-X Requirement is modified,
but the Parties agree instead to modify the HNG-X Migration Assumptions to
avoid an inconsistency with that HNG-X Requirement, such modification and any
consequent amendment needed to (i) any Tasks or (ii) any Dependencies related
to those Tasks, shall be dealt with under the Change Control Procedure with the
intention that:

(a) any adjustment to the Charges for Project HNG-X as may be necessary
may include adjustment to the Price Thresholds; and

(b) neither Party shall be obliged to carry out such Tasks or Dependencies
to the extent of that inconsistency until an appropriate CCN has been
agreed by both Parties.

Description

Following completion of rollout, Fujitsu Services will
accommodate a 2 week activity in order to roll out any remaining
Branches that have not been rolled out in the planned period.
Branches requiring roll-out beyond that point will be subject to
separate arrangements through the Change Control Procedure.
Such changes will not be chargeable to Post Office, unless the
failure to rollout within the planned period (including the
subsequent 2 week activity) is due to matters within the sole
responsibility of Post Office.

Each individual Branch must have had its router installed before
it can be migrated.

ANNEX 2
PART 1
TRANSITIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE
1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 This Part 1 of Annex 2 provides an overview of:

2.1

2.2

1.1.1 the elements of the Horizon Service Infrastructure forming part of the
Infrastructure; and

1.1.2 the related Infrastructure Services that Fujitsu Services shall provide to Post
Office,

during the Roll Out Phase.

The provisions of this Part 1 of Annex 2 shall cease to have effect upon the occurrence
of Trigger Point T6: (Counter Application Rollout Complete).

There are four elements to the Infrastructure applicable to Branches awaiting installation
of the Business Capabilities and Support Facilities during the Roll Out Phase:

1.3.1 the Central Infrastructure and Branch Telecom Infrastructure parts of the HNG-X
Service Infrastructure described in paragraphs 1.2 and 1.3.2 of Schedule B3.3;

1.3.2 the Branch Infrastructure part of the HNG-X Service Infrastructure described in
paragraph 2 of Schedule B3.:

1.3.3. Office Platform Service (OPS) (as defined in this Annex); and

1.3.4 Transaction Management Service (TMS) (as defined in this Annex).

OPS shall cease to be applicable in respect of each Branch upon the installation of the
Business Capabilities and Support Facilities in respect of that Branch and TMS will cease
to be applicable in respect of any Transactions carried out after such date at each such
Branch.

Unless specified otherwise, all references to Branches and Counter Positions in the
following paragraphs of this Annex shall be construed to mean those Branches and
Counter Positions during the Roll Out Phase where the Business Capabilities and Support
Facilities have not been installed and activated.

OFFICE PLATFORM SERVICE

Purpose

This paragraph 2 details the functions and capabilities provided by the OPS. The OPS is
provided using the Equipment installed in Branches described in Schedule B3.4.

Availability

2.2.1 User access to OPS

2.2.2

(a)

Users may only log-on to the OPS in their Branch in accordance with
their defined role. Any access to data or services outside of that Branch
is controlled exclusively by the relevant counter application.

Access to OPS and services offered via OPS to Users working in the
Branches shall be controlled by a mechanism conforming to the CCD
entitled "Horizon Office Platform Service Style Guide" (SD/STD/001),
offering multiple access levels and providing specific identification of
each User. An exception to this is the Mails Application which does not
conform to the “Horizon Office Platform Service Style Guide”
(SD/STD/001).

Authentication of all Users logging on to the OPS in the Branch shall be
undertaken by the elements of the Infrastructure on which OPS is based.
Full access control and password management facilities shall be
provided. Users shall only access those Applications for which they have
been given permission by the Branch. Each User shall be identified by
a unique User-id and individual password.

The OPS shall provide facilities to enable the Branch Manager to
establish new Users and set an initial password for all Users in a Branch.
Should a User forget their password the Branch Manager shall be able
to reset the password. The same procedure shall apply at single Counter
Position Branches and multiple Counter Position Branches.

For situations where the sole User (e.g. Branch Manager in a single
Counter Position Branch) has forgotten their password, the OPS shall
provide the facility to generate a unique key as part of the log on toa
specific username. This shall be phoned to the Help Desk who shall
provide the corresponding key which when input to OPS shall allow
access to the administration facilities. The User shall then be able to
reset their User password.

Concurrency

The solution for OPS is based on a PC infrastructure configured such that multiple
activities within a Branch do not significantly impact on each other. In particular
back office processes (e.g. report production) will be operate on a logically
consistent set of data which will not be affected by any concurrent counter
transactions.

2.3 Security

2.3.1

Security of data and audit trail for OPS

(a)

All data captured at a Branch either as part of a Transaction performed
at a Counter Position or as an administration function shall form part of
a unique Transaction which shall be given a unique reference number
by Riposte and details stored in the message store. The format of this
message store entry shall vary according to the Transaction type but will
typically contain:

(i) Post Office ID;
(ii) Counter Position ID;
(iii) unique Transaction ID;

(iv) date;

2.3.2

(f)

(v) time;

(vi) User ID;

(vii) Application; and
(viii) Transaction details.

Each Counter Position PC shall contain a journal and all journal entries
shall be automatically replicated to all other members of the work group.
A work group shall include all the Counter Position PCs in the Branch
and one of the correspondence servers, at which TMS is provided. This
correspondence server forms part of a “cluster” of correspondence
servers of which two are located on one Data Centre site and the
remaining two located on the other Data Centre site. All Transactions
associated with one correspondence server are automatically replicated
to the other site. Within each site all Transactions are reliably mirrored
within a multiple disk array which has no single point of failure.

Once data are stored in the message store they shall never be altered.
New Transactions shall always be appended to the message store.
Retrieval of data using a particular key field shall retrieve all entries
containing that field.

The security of data held within OPS shall not be compromised by any
incident nor when OPS is re-established following any Incident.

Fujitsu Services shall provide synchronisation facilities which shall
automatically check the status of the journal for a node when it is re-
established following failure. Should the journal be out of step (e.g.
through failure of the Counter Position PC) Fujitsu Services shall
automatically synchronise the journal and any data files to the same
state as all other journals in that work group. Synchronisation may occur
from another Counter Position PC (in a multi-Counter Position Branch)
or from one of the correspondence servers or the second hard disc
referred to in paragraph 4.2.4(b) (in a single Counter Position Branch).

The operating system supporting the OPS shall provide assurance of

Such interaction will take place via the DVLA On-line Link. Information concerning MOT
status and vehicle excise duty as well as other supporting data will be retrieved during
the course of such on-line interaction, as specified by Post Office Reference Data for the
purposes of the re-licensing Transaction. The interaction with DVLA POME may be
configured to deal with scenarios where no response is received from DVLA POME within
designated time periods.

APS handles interaction with customer Tokens and records Transactions in the Riposte
message store. It also passes Transaction details to EPOSS for incorporation into a
Customer Session. Transaction data is replicated by Riposte to the message stores on
file servers at the Data Centres. The APS agents extract and reformat transaction data
and present it for further analysis, summarisation and forwarding by the Business
Capabilities and Support Facilities.

The clients and tokens supported by APS are referred to in the CCD entitled “Automated
Payments System Client List” (BP/DOC/008). Specific payments and the APS
Transactions which support them conform to the relevant AP Client Specification, which
in turn references the CCD entitled “POCL Automated Payments Generic Rules”
(BP/DOC/014) and appropriate Token Technology Specification(s). Data is transferred to

to process Transactions. ETU credit products (known as Topup products or PIN products)
are invoked by swiping a card (or input of card details). ETU content products (known as
PIN/e-voucher products) are invoked by selecting an ETU desktop button. The following
Transaction Types are supported:

12.1.1 the purchase of a card based Topup product;

12.1.2 the purchase of card based PIN product;

12.1.3 the purchase of a PIN/e-voucher product;

of ETU products from menus, the presentation of screen dialogues to the User and User
data input, and the printing of receipts. It also integrates the ETU Transactions into an
EPOSS Customer Session. ETU writes data to the Riposte message store, including
"immediate" messages to initiate message exchange with the e-pay authorisation system,
provided by Business Capabilities and Support Facilities.
