Subject: Update on HNG-X R1 Rollout FOR CASCADE

Importance: High

All,
I can confirm that we have received authorisation from Post Office Ltd to proceed to rollout of HNG-X Release 1 from Post Office

following the Acceptance Gateway 4 review and Release Authorisation Board earlier today. The rollout will proceed with the
following schedule this week:-

30" June 260 branches
41° July 261 branches
2" July 110 branches plus some additional migrations to be confirmed by Post Office 30" June.

This is a tremendous achievement for the account given the challenges of the last few months. We will of course continue to
maintain a high level of vigilance on system monitoring.

We will issue weekly progress updates on the number of branches migrated.
Thanks to all the teams involved for getting the programme to this point.
Regards,

Geoff
