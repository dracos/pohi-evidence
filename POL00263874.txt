Dear Sirs

Post Office Group Litigation
Horizon Issues Disclosure

We write in response to your letters of 2 October, 18 December, 21 December, 17 January, 22 January,
4, 6 and 8 February 2019.

% Overarching Response

1.4 Before responding to each of your letters in which the Claimants have sought further disclosure
from Post Office, given the volume, scope and timing of these requests and the prejudice that
these have / are causing to Post Office's trial preparations we feel that is necessary to remind
you of the course that disclosure for the Horizon Issues Trial has taken and our concerns about
this.

1.2 Please do not feel that it is necessary to provide a response to this section of our letter. We
anticipate that there will be disagreement between the parties as to the scope of the disclosure
given by Post Office and the subsequent requests made by the Claimants, but given the
proximity to the Horizon Issues trial there is limited time for a full debate of these matters.

13 Disclosure was principally completed in May and August 2018 with little comment or feedback
from the Claimants. Then, following the Common Issues trial, the Claimants have produced 13
letters relating to Post Office's disclosure — many of which we have responded to already and this
letter addresses the remainder. All your letters have requested further disclosure from Post
Office. The total number of requests is understood to be approx. 70 separate requests. There a
number of concerns about the way in which these requests have been made which are discussed
in paragraphs 1.4 to 1.23 below. Where these concerns arise in relation to a specific letter or
disclosure request, greater detail of Post Office's concerns is provided in the latter sections of this
letter in response to each letter.

Scope

1.4 The majority of the Claimants' disclosure requests have not been drafted in line with the
Disclosure Pilot Scheme which the parties agreed to adopt. It was ordered (following a contested
CMC) that disclosure should be conducted on the basis of Model C (narrow classes or categories
of documents). In a small number of instances, the parties agreed, where appropriate for specific

issues, to use Model D (narrow search-based disclosure, without Narrative Documents). A large
number of the Claimants’ requests have sought disclosure of documents which are not limited by
a document type/category, date range or custodian. These requests are not Model C requests.
In some instances the requests have been drafted in a way which makes them broader than the
alternative Model D approach (since the Claimants have sought disclosure of Narrative
Documents). For example, the Claimants have requested documents that relate to background
facts that are neither relied upon by witnesses nor central to the Horizon Issues — ie. the request
for disclosure of documents relating to the introduction of PING and the rationale behind this
introduction. Matters have been further complicated by the fact that the Claimants have
presented requests both from the lawyers and from Mr Coyne without, it seems to us, considering
the extent of overlap between the two sets of requests or the Court's directions as to the nature
and timing of disclosure. The upshot is that, albeit by degrees, the Claimants have effectively
requested standard old-style disclosure from Post Office and have disregarded the much
narrower and more precise type of disclosure ordered by the Court.

1.5 The far-ranging scope of the Claimants’ disclosure requests means that Post Office is often
unable to even begin to identify and/or locate the documents that the Claimants wish to be
provided with. Many of the inquiries which you ask Post Office to carry out potentially cover a 20
year period and as you are aware in many cases Post Office simply does not hold documents in
a way which makes searching for categories of documents straightforward. Given that these
requests have been made shortly before the Horizon Issues trial, against the background of a
claim which has still not been pleaded in any detail by the Claimants, it is even more important for
any requests to be narrow so as documents can be gathered, reviewed and disclosed within the
time available to do so. Instead of preparing for trial, Post Office's legal team has had to divert
resources to discussing with Post Office and Freeths the scope and logistics of giving further
disclosure, which has required a considerable undertaking in the redrafting of your requests to
make them compliant with Model C as you will see below.

CPR 31.14

1.6 The Claimants have made multiple, scattered requests under CPR 31.14(1)(b) (see Freeths'
letters of 21 December 2018 and 22 January 2019).

17 In particular, the requests in your letter of 22 January 2019 were premised on the basis that Post
Office's witnesses had "been provided with/had sight of document in order to prepare their
Statements, which have not been disclosed to the Claimants." CPR 31.14(1)(b) provides that a
party may inspect a document mentioned in a witness statement and the witness must make a
specific reference to the document or allude to it directly, otherwise CPR 31.14(1)(b) does not
apply. Almost none of the requests you have made fall within CPR 31.14. They are new
requests for disclosure and it is misleading to present them as if our client has attempted to hold
back documents referred to in their witness evidence.

1.8 Even if we were incorrect, there has been a substantial delay in making these disclosure
requests: our client's evidence having been served on 28 September 2018 and 16 November
2018.

1.9 Despite your requests not being within the scope of CPR 31.14(1)(b), Post Office has provided
the disclosure sought where the scope of the request is sufficiently clear and it has been
reasonable and proportionate to do so. A full response to the requests made in your letter of 22
January 2019 is at section 9 of this letter.

Documents already disclosed

1.10 Onnumerous occasions the documents which the Claimants have sought disclosure of have
already been disclosed. By undertaking analysis of the disclosed documents we have been able
to locate the relevant documents on your behalf. Given that the documents have been disclosed
electronically and with metadata (where available), the Claimants have the same information
available to them as Post Office and should be able to locate these documents themselves. Our
concerns about disclosure requests being made before analysis of the disclosed documents has
been undertaken was raised in our letter of 10 October 2018, but does not seem to have been

AC_154206149_1 2

POL-BSFF-0101937_0001
POL00263874
POL00263874

taken into consideration. A good example of this is your request for disclosure of Charles
MacLachlan's reports, which had already been disclosed by your clients to us.

1.11 Again, undertaking this work on your behalf is taking resources away for the trial preparations
and prejudices Post Office's preparations for trial.

Timing
1.12 Disclosure for the Horizon Issues Trial has been split across various CMC Orders:

1.12.1 By the Second CMC Order (dated 2 February 2018) the Court ordered that Model C
Disclosure and the then draft Practice Direction were to apply

1.12.2 I The Third CMC Order (dated 1 March 2018) ordered disclosure of Model C classes of
documents which primarily related to the Common Issues Trial. However, it also
included early disclosure of documents which related to the Horizon Issues Trial, such
as:

(a) Technical documents stored in Dimensions.
(b) Known Error Log.

(c) Minutes of meetings of Post Office's Board of Directors concerning the roll-out of
Horizon and Horizon Online.

(d) Contract between Post Office and Fujitsu (ICL).

(e) Documents relating to the ability of Post Office (whether itself or by Fujitsu)
remotely to detect the occurrence of potential shortfalls or other branch account
discrepancies, when the same occurred and whether those discrepancies were
caused by bugs, errors and/or defects in the Horizon system; the ability of Post
Office and/or Fujitsu to conduct transactions, (by entering, deleting or otherwise
altering the same) in postmasters' branches remotely; and Balancing
Transactions.

Disclosure of these documents was between 10 and 18 May 2018. This Order also set
out a process for introductory demonstrations of Horizon for the IT experts.

1.12.3. The Fourth CMC Order (dated 21 June 2018) then provided for the disclosure of
documents for the Horizon Issues Trial (known as Stage 3 Disclosure). In the lead up
to the CMC on 5 June 2018, at which this Order was made, there was considerable
correspondence between the parties as to the scope of disclosure required for the
Horizon Issues Trial and the Claimants had a large input into the disclosure that was to
be provided by Post Office. It was open to the Claimants to request any documents
which they felt needed to be disclosed at this stage. Stage 3 Disclosure was then
provided on 1 August 2018.

1.13 After the Common Issues trial, which ended 4 months after Stage 3 Disclosure, Post Office has
received numerous requests for further disclosure. The majority of these requests could have
been encompassed within the scope of Stage 3 Disclosure since the issues and categories were
known to your clients. The Claimants did not seek to include these additional documents within
the disclosure ordered but have waited until a couple of months before the trial commences to
make substantial requests. Post Office's position is that your clients could and should have
requested many of these documents long before any witness evidence was served.

Mr Coyne's Request for Further Information
1.14 The Fourth CMC Order also ordered the inspection of the Peak and TfS systems by the

Claimants’ IT Expert (Mr Coyne) by 15 June 2018. This was because these systems are
integrated databases holding over 200,000 unique records that are not designed to be mass

‘AC_154206149_1 3

POL-BSFF-0101937_0002
POL00263874
POL00263874

extracted and disclosed. This inspection took place on 15 June 2018 and Mr Coyne had a
standing offer (and indeed binding right under a Court Order) to inspect those systems again on
reasonable request (but he never did). As was made clear before the CMC and during Mr
Coyne's inspection, it was always possible to extract a small number of Peaks manually for him
(indeed he was provided with some following the inspection visit) but the extraction of all 220,000
Peaks and the TFS entries was an altogether different proposition. Following the first inspection,
no request for disclosure of the full databases has ever been made by the Claimants.

1.15 Alongside disclosure, the Claimants’ expert had the opportunity to make requests for further
information. The process for this was set out in the Fifth CMC Order. In his requests lodged on
18 May 2018 and 26 June 2018, Mr Coyne sought a significant amount of further documentation
and he asked a number of questions about the PEAK and TfS systems. These requests were
unclear and despite us seeking clarification, no clarification was provided so Post Office could not
answer those questions. Instead, Post Office offered to try to provide voluntary disclosure of the
documents stored in these systems. It was made clear in Post Office's responses to Mr Coyne's
requests on 6 August 2018 that extraction of these databases would be time-consuming (and at
that time it was not even known if it was technically possible.) Fujitsu had to write special
software code in order to extract the primary text of these databases in a format that was usable
but nevertheless our client committed to doing this voluntarily. Mr Coyne never lodged any
objection to this proposal (as he was entitled to do under paragraph 2 of the Fifth CMC Order)
and so our client proceeded as agreed. The databases were disclosed on 27 September 2018
and 23 January 2019.

1.16 Since providing this disclosure Post Office has been continually criticised by you for providing
disclosure of these documents late. As can be seen above, this disclosure was neither late nor
even ordered. If the Claimants or Claimants’ expert had required further inspection or disclosure
of the Peaks / TfS at an earlier stage then it would have been open for the Claimants to request
this from Post Office and the Claimants could have done so from June 2018 onwards.

1.17. Mr Coyne re-raised some points and posited new questions in a revised request for information
made on 14 December 2018. This response was required by the Fifth CMC Order to be provided
by 18 August 2018. We have repeatedly asked for an explanation as to why the Claimants
disregarded the Court's direction in relation to this but have never received any explanation. This
delay has had an impact on disclosure since Mr Coyne's new RFIs were not limited to information
requests, but extended to requests for further disclosure. The delay in raising these matters has
meant that the parties lost 3 months to locate and disclose the documents sought by the
Claimants’ expert. Any resulting prejudice through disclosure being given shortly before trial has
therefore been caused by the delays of the Claimants and the Claimants' expert.

Letter of claim

1.18 In an attempt to paint a picture that Post Office has been resisting disclosure for long periods,
your letter of 22 January 2019 seeks disclosure of 30 categories of documents, some of which
are said to have been long standing requests originating from disclosure sought in the Claimants'
Letter of Claim dated 28 April 2016. These initial requests were effectively for pre-action
disclosure and were entirely superseded by the bespoke disclosure orders that were extensively
debated, agreed and made by the Court during 2018.

1.19 In any event, we note first that Post Office has disclosed over 510,000 documents and your
clients have disclosed less than 1,600 and less than 50 in relation to the Horizon Issues. The
volume of disclosure alone shows the lengths that Post Office has gone to give disclosure.

1.20 Second, this assertion is simply wrong. Section I of the Letter of Claim sought pre-action
disclosure of 32 broad categories of documents. Three of these requests sought documents

relating to "bugs". The table below set out these requests and the discussion on them between
the parties.

1.21 None of the requests which you made on 26 April 2016 seem to be the same as, or

encompassed by, the requests which you have made on 22 January 2019. Further, the lack of
engagement by the Claimants in April 2016 to assist Post Office to formulate a narrow class of
documents which could be disclosed (given that at this time the GLO had not yet been ordered
and there had been no pleadings) or provide further information when asked to do so meant that
Post Office was unable to provide the disclosure which you sought. This cannot be a criticism of

Post Office.

Conclusion on overarching comments

1.22 As set out above, there has been a clear procedure for disclosure request, response and order
which both parties were meant to comply with in early to mid-2018 and which you have effectively
ignored by making repeated last-minute requests outside that procedure and its parameters.

‘AC_154206149_1

POL-BSFF-0101937_0004
POL00263874
POL00263874

1.23 It should also be kept in mind that the Claimants' new demands for further late disclosure fall to
be considered against the background of a complete lack of engagement with Post Office's
questions about how the Claimants have undertaken their own disclosure. This matter will be
addressed in a separate letter once Post Office has had the opportunity to review the Claimants
additional disclosure which we were informed of on 7 February 2019.

2. Responses to outstanding disclosure requests

21 The remainder of this letter sets out Post Office's responses to the Claimants' outstanding
disclosure requests.

2.2 Post Office has sought to respond to all of your requests. However, given the volume of requests
that have been made if you believe that any of your requests have not been responded to it
would be appreciated if you could bring these to our attention.

3. Requests on 2 October 2018 — documents relating to known bugs / errors

3.1 Further to our letter of 11 January 2019, please find enclosed a disclosure list named
"Dalmellington, Newport and remuneration overpayment’. This list contains the relevant
documents sourced from the 59 custodian's email accounts used for Stage 3 Disclosure, which
were responsive to the keywords "Dalmellington", "Newport" and “Remuneration overpayment™.

3.2 Anumber of documents have not been disclosed since they are privileged (on the basis of legal
advice and/or litigation privilege) and some documents have been redacted on the basis of legal
advice and/or litigation privilege. These documents have been reviewed by the legal
representative in charge of disclosure.

3.3 It should be noted that Stage 3 Disclosure specifically excluded emails. The majority of
documents which are now being disclosed are emails and therefore did not fall within the scope
of a previous disclosure order.

4. Requests on 18 December 2018 — documents relating to Claimants’ witnesses

41 The Managing Judge made clear from the outset that the Horizon Issues trial was not intended to
be a trial of the merits of individual Claimants’ allegations and as we have set out in other
correspondence gave directions to that effect. Disclosure for the Horizon Issues Trial was
therefore scoped on this basis, with Post Office giving disclosure of documents concerning
Horizon in the generic sense (ie. not documents which concerned the operation of Horizon in
specific Claimants’ circumstances). The disclosure which is now sought by the Claimants is
specific to their individual witnesses and therefore would not fall within the scope of the
disclosure ordered for the Horizon Issues Trial. The Claimants’ obligation, by contrast, was
simply to give disclosure of documents relied upon as well as known adverse documents.

4.2 It was not until 28 September 2018, some two months after Stage 3 Disclosure was given, when
the Claimants served witness evidence from 6 subpostmasters / assistants that Post Office first
knew that these individuals would be involved in the Horizon Issues Trial (the Individual
Witnesses). Despite the Claimants having known the identity of the Claimants’ witnesses from
at least September 2018 (and presumably long before then) you have waited until 18 December
2018 to make the first disclosure requests for documents relating to these people.

43 As a result of the above, there has been no order by the Court requiring either party to provide
disclosure of documents relating to the Individual Witnesses. This has materially prejudiced our
client because had it known that your clients would be relying on individual evidence at trial, it
would have sought appropriate disclosure orders as part of Stage 3 Disclosure. Your lack of
transparency around your witnesses, and breach of a Court Order in filing this evidence, has
deprived our client of that opportunity and risks the trial proceeding on an unfair footing.

44 Notwithstanding the above, our aim is to try to assist the Court at trial. Pursuant to your requests
made on 18 December 2018, a disclosure list named "Claimants' Horizon Witnesses" which

AC_154206149_1 6

POL-BSFF-0101937_0005
POL00263874
POL00263874

contains the relevant, non-privileged documents reviewed by Post Office's witnesses during the
production of Post Office's responsive witness statements will be provided to you shortly.

45 In relation to Mr Singh, this Claimant was one of the 12 Claimants who was considered as a
potential Lead Claimant for the Common Issues Trial. During the selection process the parties
provided disclosure of a number of documents relating to Mr Singh (disclosed on 19 January
2018 - over a year ago). Mr Singh provided disclosure of his diary entries showing his calls with
the NBSC (C-0166-0000015 to C-0166-0000026, C-0166-0000028, C-0166-0000031 to C-0166-
0000032) and his transaction receipts (C-0166-0000033 and C-0166-0000034). Post Office also
disclosed Mr Singh's NBSC call logs (POL-0000537). Part of your request for disclosure on 18
December 2018 is therefore duplicative of the disclosure that was provided by both parties over a
year ago.

46 Further, as evident from our second letter of 19 January 2018, Post Office holds limited
documents in relation to Mr Singh due to the age of his claim and requests for disclosure of
documents relating to this Claimant should be made with this in mind.

47 In relation to Mr Patny, the majority of the documents which you have requested had already
been provided either to Mr Patny or Freeths during the course of the parties’ correspondence in
relation to his suspension. Disclosure of the NBSC call logs and a breakdown of the transaction
corrections issued to the branch were disclosed on 12 May 2017 (over a year and a half ago).
Further, copies of the transaction and event data was provided on 29 November 2017. Formal
disclosure of these documents has not yet been given, and so Begin Bates numbers will be
allocated to these documents in the disclosure list to follow.

48 Lastly, a number of the documents of which you requested disclosure were provided to you with
Post Office's responsive witness statements on 16 November 2018 (for example, Mr Latif's and
Mr Patny's HSD logs).

49 The above examples reflect the point made earlier in this letter that due to a lack of diligence on
the Claimants’ side, our client is having to identify already disclosed documents in order to
respond to requests that should not have been made in the first instance.

5. Requests on 21 December 2018 — documents referred to in Post Office's Witness
Statements

5.1 A substantive response to your letter of 21 December 2018 was provided by way of our letter of
17 January 2019. The majority of the documents which you requested disclosure of had already
been disclosed and by undertaking searches of the disclosed documents we were able to locate
these on your behalf. Of note, you requested disclosure of the Horizon System User Guide from
1999/2000 which was included within the Common Issues Trial bundle and referred to on
numerous days at the Common Issues Trial (see Day 7, page 192).

5.2 As previously requested in our second letter of 10 October 2018, before raising concerns and
queries about the disclosure provided by Post Office, please analyse the information, data and
documents which have already been provided. The time and effort required to respond to your
queries is a matter which will be raised when the costs of disclosure fall to be considered.
Further, undertaking this work on your behalf is prejudicing Post Office's preparations for trial.

5.3. There were a number of your requests which required Post Office to undertake further analysis to
locate and provide disclosure of the documents. This work has now been completed and a
disclosure list named "21 December 2018 - responses" will follow shortly.

e Asexplained above, a search for audit

(which contains all of the custodian's
documents for Stage 3 disclosure) has
been run. Post Office does not have an
obligation to provide disclosure of all audit
reports on Horizon since 2000. Post
Office has conducted a reasonable and
propionate search to locate the audit
reports and has provided disclosure of
these documents.

Subpostmasters in Post Office was in the process of searching for
relation to the bug copies of the advice sent to postmasters, but
known at Callender since the bug occurred in 2005 it was not
Square envisaged that Post Office would still hold copies

of this advice.

Post Office has been unable to locate a copy of
this advice, but during this search has come
across a number of documents which may be of
interest. Disclosure of these documents will be
provided.

5.4 We trust that the above responses finalise your requests for disclosure made in the first section
of your letter of 21 December 2018.

6. Requests on 21 December 2018 — Horizon Management Council

6.1 In relation to your request for disclosure of documents held by Mr Rees, Ms McGinn and Ms
George, you state in your letter of 21 December 2018 that "there are certain named individuals or
teams / groups within the Post Office organisation that the Claimants were not previously aware
of...". We understand this to be a reference to the Horizon Management Council and the
documents held by the three custodians which you identified. We do not agree with your position
that the Claimants were not previously aware of these custodians. POL-0218577 ("/Redacted]
Action Summary’) was disclosed on 1 August 2018 and discussed in correspondence between
the parties during October 2018. Further, the document was the subject of detailed debate at the
Common Issues Trial during November 2018.

6.2. The Claimants were aware of the three custodians detailed in POL-0218577 from as early as
August 2018. The Claimants’ disclosure request was however not made until 21 December

2018. Nevertheless, Post Office has sought to accommodate the disclosure sought in the time
which is available.

POL-BSFF-0101937_0007
POL00263874
POL00263874

6.3 In your letter of 8 February 2018 you state that Post Office was required to provide disclosure of
the documents sourced from the email accounts of Mr Rees, Ms McGinn and Ms George and the
Information Security's team's Sharepoint site pursuant to Schedule 1 of the Fourth CMC Order.
Schedule 1 provided for disclosure of documents from three categories of custodians. The
emails accounts of Mr Rees, Ms McGinn and the Information Security team's Sharepoint site
were not custodians within one of these categories and are therefore not within the scope of the
Fourth CMC Order. Further, the categories of documents expressly excluded emails. The
disclosure which we are now providing primarily consists of emails sent or received by these
custodians. Therefore, the disclosure being provided by Post Office does not fall within the
scope of the Fourth CMC Order and any prejudice caused by the delay in receiving these
documents has been caused by your client making these requests late.

64 A Disclosure List which contains the relevant, non-privileged documents from Julie George's
email account which were responsive to the search terms set out in our letter of 17 January 2019
is currently being produced and will be provided to you shortly. A number of documents will not
be disclosed since they are privileged (on the basis of legal advice and/or litigation privilege) and
some documents have been redacted on the basis of legal advice and/or litigation privilege.
These documents have been reviewed by the legal representative in charge of disclosure.

6.5 When reviewing this disclosure it has come to our attention that 121 of the documents that were
responsive to these search terms had already been disclosed. Disclosure of these documents
has not been provided a second time.

66 In respect of the documents from the email accounts of Mr Rees, Ms McGinn and the Sharepoint
site of the Information Security team, as explained in our letter of 17 January 2019 these
documents needed to be extracted before being reviewed for relevance and privilege. We have
now extracted these documents and they have been uploaded to our e-disclosure platform.
Before reviewing these documents it is proposed that the keyword search terms (set out in our
letter of 17 January 2019) that are applied to these documents are narrowed. The reason for this
is that the keyword search terms applied to the email account of Julie George generated a high
volume of false positive documents (documents which contained the keywords but were not
relevant to the issues in this claim). Of the 9,698 documents reviewed, only 13% of the
responsive documents were relevant. The proposed amendments to the search terms will follow
shortly in a separate letter.

7. Textbooks and articles referred to by Dr Worden

71 These documents are in the process of being uploaded to Magnum and it would be appreciated if
access to these could be provided to Mr Coyne.

8.3 In respect of the usernames that do not exist today and never existed in the past as far as Fujitsu
are aware, these are all invalid names, i.e. User IDs which someone tried to use in error and the
system did not let them log on because they were not valid. An example of this is as follows:

DML == Data Manipulation Language

88 DML is a generic database term (i.e. not specific to Oracle) references to which are plentiful on
the internet. It was included to give context to terms such as SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT.

SSC_tools

8.9 “SSC_TOOLS’ is a read-only access database user (DRS, TES, APS2, TPS, LFS, BRDB,
BRSS) used for support tools such as HORIce and “Smiley”. It was introduced in 2014 as part of
the introduction of Service Level Reporting using HORIce.

OCP records
8.10 These have been disclosed to you, as per our letter dated 24 January 2019.
9. Requests on 22 January 2019 - Witness Statement disclosure

9.41 In this letter you have made a number of further requests for documents based on assertions
that: (1) there are gaps in our client's disclosure; and/or (2) our client's witnesses "have been
provided with/had sight of documents in order to prepare their statements, which have not been
disclosed to the Claimants". As explained above, under CPR 31.14 disclosure of documents on
the basis of a witness having sight of them is not the correct test to be applied. In relation to the
gaps in our clients’ disclosure, save for a small number of exceptions, your requests are new and
wide ranging requests for further disclosure for which the Claimants have not attempted to draft
as a Model C request. Although you assert that there are gaps in our client's disclosure, you
have made no attempt to point to any provisions of the Second, Third or Fourth CMC Orders that
our client is said to have breached. We respond to your requests below but if you seriously wish
to maintain the position that Post Office has not complied with CMC Orders, please explain which
disclosure obligations have not been fulfilled by Post Office. We reserve our client's right to
respond further in the event that you seek to articulate your assertion in this regard.

Paul Smith requests

9.2 Your requests for disclosure of documents relating to TCs issued, challenged and successfully
challenged; the introduction of the TC case management system and records from that system;
and the decisions to issue TCs and resolve disputes about TCs are all outside of the scope of the
Horizon Issues Trial.

9.3 As already explained in our letter dated 8 August 2018, the full extent of Post Office's back-office
reconciliation procedures (i.e. the procedures by which TCs are issued and disputes in relation to
TCs resolved) are not within the scope of the Horizon Issues Trial.

9.4 It should be noted that paragraph 10 of the Third CMC order required our client to “/...] prepare a
document, from the information available [...], setting out the aggregate volume and value of
Transaction Corrections issued annually since 1999". That document was provided to you under
cover of our letters dated 18 May 2018 and 28 June 2018 and our client has therefore satisfied its
obligation under paragraph 10 of the Third CMC Order. Further, Category 25 of the Stage 2
Disclosure required Post Office to disclose "Post Office written policies, process documents, and
formal internal guidance documents (not emails) regarding the issuing of Transaction
Corrections." A review of the documents disclosed under this category should provide adequate
information for the purposes of the Horizon Issues Trial.

95 If the Claimants wish to continue to pursue this request for disclosure, please could you confirm
which Horizon Issue(s) these documents are relevant to and provide a revised request by way of
a Model C class of documents.

96 Finally, your request for documents on which Dr. Worden has made assumptions is incorrect. Dr.

Worden refers to facts presented to him in Mr Smith's statement, not documents. There are
therefore no documents to be disclosed under this request.

11.1 Your letter states that "/t{his information should have been provided along with your client's
disclosure and the delay in receiving it is unacceptable." Post Office is required to provide
disclosure of documents. There is no further obligation on Post Office to explain the contents of
documents or provide assistance with the interpretation of them. Post Office has done so ona
number of occasions not because it is required to do so, but so as to assist the Claimants. This
should not be mistaken with a requirement for Post Office to provide further information. Further
and as we have explained on numerous occasions, Post Office is not in control of a number of
documents which you request disclosure of and is reliant on the assistance of Fujitsu to locate
and disclose documents. The information which you have requested was not readily available to
Post Office since it is data held by Fujitsu.
11.2 Inresponse to your queries, Fujitsu have confirmed the numerical codes mean:
