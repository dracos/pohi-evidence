1. The updated Insurance Note
2. The updated letter to FJ

Apologies for the delay in getting these two you.

The Insurance Note incorporates your suggestions. I've also made a few tweaks to make it more about general risks
rather than just D&O risks.

I've also re-read the note from the Insurers re PI cover (copy attached). It seems pretty clear that there's no PI cover but I
can't see the harm in sending the note to the brokers and asking them to confirm their view that the PI policy won't
respond to this scenario. If nothing else, this shifts the risk from you to the brokers.

Quick update on an expert — I've spoken to both Mazars and GT re expert witness support. GT may be conflicted as
they've acted for SPMRs previously. They are pulling together details of their historic work to see what it covered (ie. it
might just be booking keeping and auditing). Mazars think they are clear of conflicts and I'm speaking to them on Monday
to go through matters in more detail.

Kind regards
Andy
