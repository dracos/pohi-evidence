2.2 PO uses the “Horizon” PoS accounting system in every branch:

- Supplied by Fujitsu

- First introduced in 1995; current version (Horizon OnLine) introduced
in 2010

- Currently >60,000 users processing 6 million transactions a day; 2
billion transactions a year

- 500,000 users since launch

- Relied on by our trading partners (HM Govt., banks etc)

- Key Principles:
© double entry book keeping
© exact record of counter transactions stored in secure audit

database

2.3 Some PMs started attributing branch losses to Horizon
- Early 2012 James Arbuthnot MP asks POL to look into it
- In 2012 POL instructs Second Sight to look at some of the cases
- First report in July 2013
o “no evidence of system wide (systemic) problems with
the Horizon software”
co issues with the way we dealt with individual PMs, i.e.
branch operation practices and proceses

2.4 PO very concerned about the impact on criminal cases

- considered content of July 2013 report against the prosecutors’ duty
of continuing disclosure

- setup the “sift review” process

- Suitability of that approach checked by Brian Altman QC

- made disclosures as a consequence of those reviews

- revisited approach to agent engagement, incl. account discrepancies
and prosecutions

2.5 Scheme to resolve individual complaints:
- Set up with Stakeholders — JFSA and J. Arbuthnot in particular
- 150 applicants
© 44 involve a criminal conviction
© 17 of 20s.17 Notice cases (cf. Case Crib Sheet)
- Progress visible to applicants, advisors, and the Scheme’s Working
Group (SS; JFSA; Tony Hooper).
- Certain MPs also updated
- Stakeholders begin publicly challenging the Scheme in Dec. 2014
- March 2015 PO decides to put all cases through to mediation except
those with a court ruling
STRICTLY PRIVATE & CONFIDENTIAL — SUBJECT TO LEGAL PRIVILEGE

© we won't mediate a case where there is a court ruling on
the substance of the complaint which mediation can’t
change
- WG now redundant BUT work still visible to applicants, advisors, and
SS, with MPs being offered meetings to discuss individual cases.

2.6 Focus of complaints continues to be PO’s processes and practice
- SS investigations:

o “have shown that the majority of branch losses were
caused by ‘errors made at the counter”

o Recognise losses also caused by fraud / theft (by SPMs
or third parties)

o recognise that deliberate false accounting prevents
investigation into losses

2.7 SS expressly accept it is not expert in criminal law and procedure BUT
still in Part Two state PO might not:
- investigate claims properly
- have the evidential foundation to bring a criminal charge
- properly apply the Code for Crown Prosecutors / be improperly
motivated in bringing a charge (asset recovery)

2.8 These statements have entered the public domain and may encourage
people to take action

2.9 Other avenues being pursued by applicants
- Media coverage
- Westminster Hall Debate / BIS Select Committee
- Threats of civil court action
