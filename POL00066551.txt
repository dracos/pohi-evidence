tam employed within the People & Organisational Development Business unit of the

ice and have been so employed for approximately 9 years, my official title being
Postal Officer-Agents Expenses.

The section I work in deals with managing Subpostmasters attendance..

This section keeps records pertaining to the employment history of Post Office Ltd
outlets (Sub Post Offices or Modified Sub Post Offices) run by ‘Agents’ (Sub
Postmasters and Postmasters). All such offices are required to notify this section when
leave is taken either by the agent themselves or any of their staff, with regards to the
Sub Postmasters, they are entitled to receive a substitution payment from Post Office
Ltd when they take leave and appoint a temporary sub postmaster to run the office
whilst they are away. In those instances Post Office Ltd pay a set amount per day
towards the cost of the temporary or relief sub postmaster. As such this section would
keep a record of such claims and therefore indicate the periods of leave taken by a Sub

Postmaster.

With Modified Sub Post Offices (MSPO), until April 2002, the Postmaster of these
outlets could not claim such substitution payments from Post Office Ltd, though they
were still required to inform this section of any leave taken.

Continuation of statement of Sarah Jane BOARDMAN

I have been asked by Mr M Patel, of the Investigation section of Post Office Lid to
interrogate our computerised records in relation to Rugeley Post Office (MSPO), 18
Anson Street, Rugeley WS15 2BE, the Postmaster being Mr Cari Page.

From our records I can say that Mr Page commenced as postmaster of Rugeley Post
Office on 1* April 1997 Our records also indicate that Mr Page has not informed this
section of any periods of leave he may have taken and indeed since April 2002 when
he could have claimed for a substitution payment, no such claim has been recorded
from Mr Page.

This does not however mean that Mr Page has never taken a holiday since he took
over Rugeley Post Office, it merely means that he has not reported any periods of leave
to this section even though he is required to do so.

Our records concerning agents attendance go back as far as June 28 1999, which is
when this Service Centre was created. Prior to this records may be available from the

old Midlands regional office.

Cheques taken over the Post Office counter are processed on a daily basis by our

it were a Barclays bank cheque, this would be sent to Barclays bank.

if for any reason the bank concerned does not honour the cheque, it is returned to the
Co-op clearing bank who in turn send them to the unpaid cheque team. Their role

Bureau. As the amount of the cheque was very excessive and there were no card
details, though it was well in excessive of a card limit anyway, I contacted the
Postmaster at Rugeley Post Office that same day and as far as I can recall, I believe I
initially spoke to a female member of staff to be told that the Postmaster was not
available. Later the same day I telephoned the Post Office again and on this occasion
spoke to the Postmaster. I asked him what the cheque related to and informed him that
he should not be taking cheques for such large amounts. As far as I can recall, he stated
that the cheque related to Bureau transaction and that the Post Office would loose a
large amount of revenue if we turned this customer away and from the extent of the

conversation I was lead to believe that the Postmaster knew this customer fairly well.

Following the conversation with the Postmaster, I then advised my line Manager of the

circumstances.

The following day I received a further two (2) unpaid cheques which again were
unidentified and therefore came to my section. These two cheques were for an amount
of £100,000.00 and £90,909.09 and again had been datestamped on the reverse with the
Rugeley datestamp and the word Bureau had been written on. [ then alerted my Line

Manger to the fact that I had two more large unpaid cheques.

Sometime in mid January 2003, I cannot now be specific about the date, I was contacted
by Mr M Patel of the Investigation section at which time I made him aware of the fact
that I was in possession of three (3) HSBC cheques which had all been accepted at
Rugeley Post Office over the Christmas period and had been returned by our Bank, the

Co-operative Bank, as payment had been stopped. All three cheques were drawn on

back to the Post Office as payment had also been stopped on them, these further two
cheques were for an amount of £ 100,000.00 and £ 84,332.18. L also provided Mr Patel

Up until October 2002, all Post Office Branches throughout the Country were set daily
cash holding targets, which were revised on a periodic basis. The Offices were also
supplied with fixed standard replenishment values, which remained constant unless
changed by the branch.

The reason behind setting daily cash targets was to minimise Post Office costs in lost
interest whilst maintaining sufficient cash to meet the office's daily requirement. In
order to carry out this process ail branches have to supply their daily cash on hand

physically held on site at the office. I should also point out that this figure relates only to
Sterling and does not include Foreign currency though would include any sterling held
within the Bureau til!.

The method used by the branches to notify this section of their daily ONCH figure
required completion of a form known as an ONCH return form given the number P4108.
This form would be submitted by each branch once a week usually on the Thursday
showing the daily cash holding figures for the previous cash account week.

Upon receipt of these forms within this section, the team here would manually input the
figures into a computerised system called RECALL. This database would be used to
compare the submitted Wednesday figure to the Wednesday target as that was the
most recent actual holding figure. The team would then contact branches to agree
remedial action to correct the excessive cash holding.

The total weekly submitted figure was also compared with the weekly set target figure
so that remedial action could be taken with the branches if required.

The form P4105 can also be submitted by fax to this section, however, if we did not
receive a form either by post or by fax the team here would contact the branch
concerned by telephone to request that information. [f this method was also
unsuccessful and we did not have any figures from a branch then the RECALL system
automatically used the previous six weeks figures to obtain an average, which was then

used for that week.

The P4105 forms are now obsolete, though when in use thelr retention period was only

category, was Rugeley MSPO.

The RECALL system in use ai the time allowed the facility to maintain an individual

contacting Ruegley MSPO on Thursday 25° July 2002, although I have made this entry
on the following morning, I cannot now recall why this entry was not entered at the time.

The reason why I would have contacted the office was because it would have featured
high on the list of branches exceeding target and this could have been as a result of

RECALL providing estimated figures and therefore I needed to obtain actual figures
from the office.

Upon initial contact that day I believe it was Carl Page, the postmaster who I spoke to
and later that day the team would have received a fax from the office giving actual cash
holding figures for cash account weeks 14, 15 and 16. On receipt of this fax I would )
have noticed that the actual declared figures were far higher than the set targets and /
therefore I contacted the office again later that day and definitely spoke to Carl Page
requesting that he return £250,000.00 back to the cash centre as he was well over
target.

I cannot now recall exactly what was said at that time by Mr Page however from the
entry I have recorded in DPB/01, it must have lead me to have concerns that the cash
wouid not be returned and therefore I contacted the Retail Line Manager responsible for
that office, Mr Stephen Cartwright and made him aware of the situation.

The above all occurred on Thursday 2s" duly 2002, though I made the entry on the log
on Friday 26" July 2002 in the morning.

On Friday 26" July 2002 at 09:28 hours I have made another entry on the log, this
would have been in relation to the fact that the Cash in Transit (CIT) crew who would
have attended the office to collect the surplus cash had reported that there was nothing
there for collection and therefore I would have been made aware of this and
immediately contacted the office myself. Upon doing so I have obviously been made
aware that Carl Page (CP) was not in the office and the remaining staff indicated that
they had nothing to return. I therefore contacted Mr Cartwright and made him aware of
this on the same day.

I am employed as a Retail Line Manager (RLM) by Post Office Ltd and have been so

employed for approximately 5 years.

My Role as an RLM is wide ranging including the appointment process for new
Subpostmasters, monitoring and taking appropriate action on targets and standards,
including Overnight Cash Holding figures (ONCH), through to the vacancy process

when a Subpostmaster leaves the business.

During July 2002, I was covering for one of my colleagues, Mr Jim Coney, also an RLM
whilst he was away on annual leave. One of the Post Offices in Jim’s area was
Rugeley MSPO. I was covering Jim's area for a two week period towards the end of

July 2002.

Bristol, though I cannot now remember the name of the gentleman I spoke to. I know
this date was Friday 26" July 2002 as I have referred to my Travel & Subsistence claim,
which was submitted at the time. The Cash Management section made me aware of
the fact that a Cash In transit (CIT) vehicle (secure vehicle) had been sent to Rugeley
MSPO to collect a surplus of cash and that when the vehicle had arrived at the office,
the Postmaster, Mr Carl Page was not present and therefore the cash could not be

collected and the staff knew nothing about the collection.

As a result of this conversation, I spoke with the Audit section to see if I could arrange

for an Asset Verification (AV) of the office, attempts were made to perform an audit that
day, however soon after lunch time it became apparent that the audit team were unable
to send anyone to the office, therefore I was asked if I would attend the office and carry

out a spot check of the cash on hand, which I agreed to do

On the same day later that afternoon, I attended Rugeley Post Office without prior
warning and was allowed into the secure area of the office. I was informed that the
Postmaster, Mr Page was not in and that they did not know when he would return to the

office, nor where he had gone.

I asked the staff who was in charge whilst Mr Page was not there and nobody seemed

to know so I deait with two ladies, whose names I cannot now remember. I informed
them that there were some concerns as Cari had been asked to return a large sum of
money that week and had failed to do so and therefore I was at the office to carry out a

check of the cash.

One of the ladies asked me ff they should try and get hold of Car! on his mobile phone
and i agreed that they should attempt to do so. I was then informed that a message

had been left on his mobile phone to contact the office.

I then asked one of the ladies to interrogate the Horizon computerised system and
obtain from it a printout known as a snap shot. This ‘snap shot’ provides a summary of
the cash and stock which should be available at the office at the time of the printout and
therefore armed with this I was able to perform an examination of the physical cash on
site. i actually asked the ladies to count out the bulk cash held in the main safe in front
of me and it was evident that the bulk cash represented the majority of the figure shown

on the snap shot. I did not retain this Horizon snap shot printout.

I then agreed with the ladies as to the amount of ‘working’ cash I should leave at the
office and the amount, which was surplus and could be despatched to the cash centre.

The figure agreed was £ 160,000.00 in Sterling which I asked the ladies to ‘bag’ up

afternoon.

A despatch of cash or stock to the Cash Centre is commonly referred to as a

Remittance out (REM) within the Post Office.

During late afternoon, about 3pm to 3:30 pm, though I cannot recall exactly, Mr Page
contacted the office by phone and I spoke with him. I explained to Mr Page why I was
at the office and what ! had done, Mr Page stated that he would return to the office in

20 minutes.

When Mr Page arrived at the office, I again explained to him why I had attended the
office and the fact that I had arranged with the ladies to REM out £160,000.00 and in

fact this cash was being collected by CIT as Mr Page arrived at the office.

I then had a brief chat with Mr Page and then left the Post Office. Subsequently I
informed those parties including Mr Coney upon his return of what had taken place. I

had no further dealing’s with this Post Office.

Agent offering holidays to the general public, within the outlet is a Bureau de Change

general public for which the exchange rate is displayed on a plain manual board that is

updated daily as the exchange rates fluctuate.

know the Postmaster, Mr Carl Page, I also know some of the post office staff members

as they come into the Co-op to purchase foreign currency from us from time to time.

At times I have received a telephone call from one of the staff at Rugeley Post Office
who ask if we have a particular currency in stock and the exchange rate. It would
appear that on these occasions the Post Office have run out of a particular currency and
therefore they come to the Co-op and buy that currency from us. Having taken the

afterwards they pop along to the Co-op and collect it having paid me the equivalent
amount in Sterling. Although I am aware that this currency is for the Post Office, they
are not given a discount or preferential exchange rates, the rates they are provided are
the same as that displayed on our exchange rate board and given to the ordinary
members of the public regardless of how large an amount of currency is purchased

from us.

When I perform the transaction, our computerised system calculates the sterling
amount which I collect from the customer, it also produces a printout which shows the
customers nase, which for the Post Office I put down as Mr C Page regardless of
whether it was he who came to collect it or one of his staff, it also shows the total
amount of each type of currency purchased. One copy of this printout is handed to the

customer together with their currency

In late April 2003, I received a telephone call from Mr M Patel of the Post Office Security
tear making enquiries about the Co-op’s dealings with the Rugeley Post Office. Asa
result of this conversation I looked through our archived records and extracted any
records where foreign currency had been sold to Rugeley Post Office during the period
from the beginning of 2002 to 13% January 2003.

Subsequently on Wednesday 30! April 2003, Mr Patel attended the Co-op in Rugeley at
which time he spoke with the outlet Manager and myself. At that time I had not had
sufficient time to look through all of the records and therefore had only found some of

the computer printouts, which I copied and handed to Mr Patel.

schedule, which he had compiled using the information shown on the copies of the
foreign currency printouts I had previously given to him and identified as item number

information contained on the original printouts held by me (GT/1) and show the
various transactions conducted in relation to the sale of currency to Rugeley Post Office

since the beginning of 2002 to 13 January 2003.

Mr Patel also asked me to interrogate our computerised system and to extract from it
the exchange rate we were providing for the sale of Euros to the general public ona
number of specific dates, unfortunately that was not possible and the only way to
obtain those exchange rates was to physically go through our archived records and
extract the records pertaining to the sale of Euros on the specified dates given to me by
Mr Patel. Mr Patel then recorded the relevant figures on a schedule he had prepared
(MP/101) and headed Co-op Travel Rugeley - Euro Exchange Rate. Most of these
exchange rates are for periods in the year 2002, these are the exchange rates that the Co-

op would have sold Euros on the given date.

Later that afternoon, I was present when a gentleman who i now know to be Mr Carl

solicitor. I heard Mr Patel inform Mr Page that he would be further interviewed and Mr
Page responded by saying he wished to have a solicitor in attendance. Attempts were
then made by the Custody Officer to get hold of the solicitor requested by Mr Page,
however, this proved unsuccessful and a Duty solicitor was requested. Later that
afternoon, after Mr Patel and I had spoken with the Duty Solicitor, it became apparent
that Mr Page’s 24 hours in custody was fast approaching and therefore it was agreed
that there was insufficient time to conduct an interview that day. Mr Page was then

released from Police bail.

Continuation of statement of MANISH PATEL

I was able to establish that large amounts of foreign currency, mainly Euros were being
sold on a weekly basis from Rugeley Post Office and that our own Money Laundering
section had not been notified by anyone at Rugeley Post Office of these large
transactions as should be the case. This information was imparted to H.M Customs &
Excise.

in Early January 2003, H.M Customs & Excise contacted me again and made me
aware of an HSBC bank cheque that they had in their possession to the value of
£112,765.96, it was drawn on the account of RPX Recycled Plastics and was dated 11"
November 2002, made payable to Post Office Ltd and had been accepted at Rugeley
Past Office for payment of Euros. I therefore initiated enquiries to try and establish the
exchange rate used by Rugeley Post Office for that one transaction on 11°" November
2003.

On the afternoon of Monday 13” January 2003, before I had received the information
regarding the exchange rate used on the 11" November 2002, I received a call from
our internal Money Laundering section requesting that I urgently contact H.M Customs

Continuation of statement of MANISH PATEL

I was soon able to establish that the exchange rate which should have been applied to
the sale of euros that day (13.01.03) by all Post Office outlets was 1.4583 and that ifa
single transaction was for £5,000 worth of Sterling or more, a preferential exchange
rate of 1.4752 could have been applied. Therefore it appeared that Rugeley Post

Office had sold euros to at a very preferential rate as shown below.

» 584,000 Euros bought at 1.62 exchange rate = £360,493.83 sterling paid

e §84,000 Euros at the correct exchange rate of 1.4752 = £395,878.52 sterling
should have been paid.

e Therefore the transaction was underpaid by £35,384.69.

I then spoke to Mr Philip Hunt, H.M Customs & Excise officer and also Detective
Inspector Mark Abbotts of the Staffordshire Major Crime Unit. I was informed that the
investigation had now been handed over to DI Abbots team by Customs & Excise to
pursue what now appeared to be Theft from the Post Office as opposed to Money
Laundering as first believed by H.M Customs & Excise.

I then contacted one of my team, Mandy Bushell and requested that she meet up with
officers from Staffordshire Major Crime unit (MCU) with the view to arrest the
Postmaster of Rugeley Post Office, a gentleman called Car! Adrian Page.

I also requested another one of my team members, Mr Colin Price to make
arrangements with the Post Office Audit section to have Rugeley Post Office audited on

I then made my way to Staffordshire Police HQ and met up with my colleague Mrs

that Mr Page the Postmaster had left the Post Office earlier that afternoon and had not
returned to the office, I was also made aware that a person called Brendon Douglas
Horton, a driver, had also been arrested by Customs & Excise at the time of

arrest and that both were currently in Police custody.

lt was agreed that Mr Page’s whereabouts should be ascertained and the Police
officers commenced this process, it was also agreed that Rugeley Post Office should
be searched and therefore the Major Crime Unit obtained a search warrant.

Later that evening at approximately 20:50 hours together with Mrs Bushell and a
number of Police Officers, I attended the premises of Rugeley Post Office, 18 Anson
Street Rugeley. in order to gain access to the premises, the Police had arranged for
one of the Post Office staff, Mrs Margaret Pearce to attend with the office keys. Shortly
after our arrival at the Post Office, a lady who I now know to be Mrs Margaret Pearce
arrived and I heard the Police officers explain to her what their intentions were. Mrs
Pearce then unlocked the premises and disabled the alarms before we all went inside.

A search of the secure area of the Post Office was then conducted by the Police
Officers though Mrs Bushell and I advised on the type of documentation, which should
be seized. All three safes in the Post Office were also opened including the safe
containing the Bureau till which was removed from it's insert. On examination of this till
it was noticed that there were five (5) HSBC bank cheques contained within this till,
these were seized by the Police and are now exhibited as item number NJW/5. A
closer examination of these cheques showed that all were drawn from the same
account (account number 71392875), RPX Recycled Plastics Ltd and all were for
substantial amounts, details of each cheque are shown below.

Officers that Mr Carl Page, the Postmaster had contacted the Police by telephone and
was due to attend the Police station later that evening.

On Wednesday 15" January 2003, after having taken advice from the Post Office Legal
department in Croydon, it was agreed that of the five (6) HSBC bank cheques seized by
the Police from Rugeley Post Office (item number NJW/5), four (4) of these related to
the one transaction conducted on the morning of Monday 13" January 2003 and as the
euros for this transaction had been seized and where currently being held by Customs
& Excise, then these cheques should not be presented to the bank for clearance,
however the fifth cheque for an amount of £278,181.82 and dated Qn January 2003
and which Mr Page during interview had stated was in lieu of three (3) cheques which
‘bounced’ during Christmas 2002, should be presented to the Bank for clearance as the

equivalent value of Euros had already been provided ta GRO I As a result I

requested Mrs Bushell to make arrangements to present the above-mentioned cheque
to a bank for express clearance and also to recover all of the exhibits taken from the
Post Office during the search from the Police in Staffordshire.

Later that afternoon, I was made aware by Mrs Bushell that she had been contacted by
a lady in the accounts section of the Post Office in Chesterfield who was in possession
of three (3) very large value cheques accepted at Rugeley Post Office during Christmas
2002 for Bureau Transactions and all three had “ Payment Stopped”. Mrs Bushell
informed me that she had provided my details to this lady and asked her to contact me
directly.

Later that afternoon, I spoke to the lady who had earlier spoken with my colleague,
Mandy Bushell. Mrs Elaine Lievesley informed me that she had copies of three (3)
cheques which had all been accepted at Rugeley Post Office over the Christmas 2002
period for Foreign currency transactions, all three cheques were drawn from the same
account of RPX Recycled Plastics Ltd for the amounts of £100,000.00, £ 87,272.73 and
£90,909.09 and dated 20.12.02, 20.12.02 and 23.12.02 respectively. Copies of these
three cheques were then faxed to my office in St Albans. Mrs Lievesley also informed

me that she had been made aware by the Co-op Bank that two (2) further large value
cheques totalling £184,332.18 were also being returned to the Post Office as payment
had been stopped.

The first 3 cheques mentioned above in total equate to £278,181.82, which matches
identically in vaiue to the fifth cheque, cheque number 100148 (item NJW/5) seized by
the Police from the Post Office, this cheque's value being £278,181.82.

As the value of stopped cheques was now substantial, five (5) cheques totalling
£462,514.00 and therefore ultimately a potential loss to the Post Office, I sought advice
from the Post Office Commercial Litigation section with regards to freezing bank
accounts and assets of those concerned.

Later that day I requested one of my colleagues, Mr Michael Cooksey to recover the
exhibits held by Mr Mark Irvin and to meet me the following moming to hand them over

Subsequently over the next few weeks and months, I liased with both H.M. Customs &
Excise, the Major Crime unit and the Financial Investigation team of Staffordshire
Constabulary and various sections within the Post Office organisation in order to further
this investigation, Large amounts of documentation was received from the various
sections and analysed, certain information being incorporated into various schedules
compiled by me to illustrate various findings.

One of the main parts of the analysis centred around the examination of the Forde
Moneychanger till rolls, items NJW/1 & NJW/2, which had been recovered from
Rugeley Post Office during the Police search on Monday 13" January 2003.

There were a large number of till rolls recovered and an examination revealed till rolls
relevant to periods in 2001, 2002 and up until 43" January 2003. Of the till rolls
relevant to the year 2001, the dates ranged from 18" January 2001 to 30" August
2001, covering roughly an eight month period, however this did not cover a continuous
8 month period as a quantity of till rolls were missing, in total some 4 months of the 8
month period was missing due to the lack of till rolls. For the purposes of this
investigation none of the till rolls relating to 2001 have been examined, they now form
part of the unused material.

The investigation has been concentrated to cover the period of 2002 and early 2003, of
the till rolls which were recovered for this period they covered the period from 7" March
2002 to 13° January 2003, week number 46 to week number 42 of the following
financial year, however even this period is not continuous as there are several till rolls
missing which cover a period of 27 working days. I have listed below the till rolls which

with a sterling value of £93,939.39 and hence the Grand total figures have
changed since the interview with Mr Page on 238 April 2003. All previous copies
of schedule MP/3 are now part of the unused material.

2. Every transaction where Rugeley Post Office had bought back (buy back) 1000
euros or more from a customer was also identified and similarly a photocopy of
that section of the till roll taken, I produce these photocopies as item number
MP/5A. In certain cases where a transaction of less than 1000 euros occurred
immediately after a transaction for over 1000 euros, this transaction was also

Schedule MP/5 illustrates all of the transactions where Rugeley Post Office has bought
back euros from customers in excess of 1000 notes at a time. The Post Office does
offer a commission free ‘Buy Back’ service for foreign currency aimed at holidaymakers
who have gone abroad with an amount of foreign currency and not spent all of it on
holiday and have therefore returned to the united Kingdom with an amount of currency,
which they would like to convert back to sterling. it would be reasonable to expect that
these amounts being brought back to the UK would be relatively small amounts and
therefore I set a level of 1000 euros or above as my criterion in order to compile the
schedule. It would be expected that a normal holiday maker is unlikely to bring back
more than 1000 euros to the UK hence I wished to examine what level of these
transactions were being conducted at Rugeley Post Office. ft can be seen from this
schedule that the first such buy back occurs on 28.03.02 and the last recorded
transaction occurs on 04.01.03 and that in total 90,830 euros were bought back by
Rugeley Post Office giving a Sterling equivalent of £58,507.64. In the last column of
this schedule I have added a Remarks column where I have recorded certain
information mainly to do with when a transaction for the sale of Euros was conducted
GRO and its timeliness with a buy back.

Exhibit item number MP/81 is a number of photocopies of the relevant section of till rol!
relating to the weekly Forde Moneychanger Command 10 summary printout. The
periods produced cover weeks 19 to 22 (01.08.02 to 28.08.02) and weeks 24 to 41

with a full summary of what has been occurring within the Bureau de Change till that

Furthermore the figures in relation to the Sterling value of cash held in the Bureau Till
as shown on the command 10 summary together with the revaluation and commission
figure must be physically entered into the Horizon computer terminal by an operator.
These figures are required to be fed into the Horizon system in order to take into
account the transactions conducted by the Forde Moneychanger, which is a ‘stand
alone machine’ and not directly connected to the Horizon system. in order to carry out
the full weekly Office ‘Balance’ the figures from the Command 10 summary are required
to be fed into the Horizon computer system which can then perform the weekly office

When the weekly cash account is printed off, the three figures discussed will also

Bureau de Change commission figure and Revaluation figure will appear on page 3 of

Exhibit item number MP/83 consist of several copies of the portion of Forde
Moneychanger till roll relating to the transfer of currency into the office between weeks
33 to 42 (13.11.02 to 13.01.03). The information contained on these portions of the till
rolis has been summarised on schedule MP/82, which I now produce. When the Post
Office outlet receives Foreign Currency from the Stock Centre in Hemel Hempstead, it
does so via a special delivery pouch conveyed by secure transport. As the insurance
limit per pouch is limited to £2,500, each pouch will only contain a maximum of up to
£2,500 in foreign currency, therefore if an office orders a large volume of currency, say
for instance £25,000 worth, the office would receive ten (10) pouches each containing
up to £2,500 of foreign currency.

Upon receipt of the currency at the Post Office outlet, a delivery advice note will have
been enclosed in the pouch which will provide a breakdown of each type of currency
enclosed (an example is item number LGH/02), the volume of currency and it’s sterling
value based on the exchange rate shown on the advice note. The recipient is then
required to input the volume and exchange rate of each currency into the Forde
Moneychanger. By performing this task the operator is effectively ‘topping up’ the
Bureau de Change till and telling the Forde Moneychanger by how much and of what
currency you are topping it up with. The Forde Moneychanger knows what currency
and the value of that currency it had before (Command 10 summary) and therefore by
transferring more currency into it, the Forde Moneychanger is aware of how much

additional currency has been added and therefore the total volume and value of
currency held in the office whether that be physically in the Bureau till itself or partly in
the Bureau till and the Main safe or anywhere else used to house the bulk currency.

As sales of currency and buy backs are performed throughout the week, the Forde
Moneychanger is used to perform these transactions and therefore it keeps a running
tally of what has been sold and what has been bought, which ultimately allows the
operator at the end of the cash account week to request the Command 10 summary at
which time the Forde Moneychanger will have worked out what you started with, what
was sold and bought throughout the week and what was transferred in from the stock
centre and tell you what you should have left in way of both volume of currency and
sterling value.

it can be seen from schedule MP/82 that throughout the weeks in question, almost on a
daily basis, large volumes of euros are transferred into the Forde Moneychanger. If the
figures from this schedule are compared to the schedule supplied by Mr Hutchins,
LGH/04 it can be seen that the sterling values virtually match those for the relevant
periods, the slight differences being that schedule LGH/04 shows the sterling value of
the entire order which in some cases includes other currencies as well as Euros and
MP/82 only takes into account the sterling value of the euros transferred in.

in the last week on the schedule, week number 42, it can be seen that on the 9", 10"
and 11" of January 2003, 150,000 euros each day is transferred into the Forde

14 million euros (14,042,405.00) to a number of Bureau de Change outlets, mainly to
the chain of Thomas Cook Retail outlets in and around the Birmingham area over that

time period and that this equated to a little over 8Y2 million pounds sterling
{£8,598,889.69). The original schedule provided to me by H.M Customs & Excise now

Having examined these copy cheques, which unfortunately are of a fairly poor quality, I

The copy cheques together with the relevant copy Batch Control Voucher (BCV) are

When the Post Office despatches cheques, which have been accepted over the
counter as payment for transactions or indeed deposits into bank accounts, these
cheques must be despatched by the office on a daily basis so that bill payments are
met and funds credited to customers accounts.

The normal process used by Post Offices is to set a time every day called the ‘Cut off
time when a member of staff or the manager will collate and despatch various
documentation which needs to be accounted for daily such as the cheques taken over
the counter. Each serving position in the Post Office will more than likely have taken
several cheques in lieu of payment from the general public over the course of the day,
at the ‘Cut off time which is normally somewhere between 1630 hours and 1700 hours
each day, apart from Wednesday, each counter position will hand over the number of
cheques they have taken that day together with a printout showing the total number and
value of the cheques. These are then collated by one individual who amaigamates all
of the cheques together and obtains a total figure in relation to quantity and value.

These two figures are then entered onto the Batch Control Voucher (BCV) together with
the office FAD code, the date of despatch and a datestamp impression before it and all
the associated cheques are placed into a special envelope called a ‘Cheque envelope’
which is just slightly smaller than an A4 envelope and is coloured in distinctive red and
white stripes. This envelope together with other special envelopes containing other
products which are accounted for daily are then handed to the Royal Mail postman
when he/she arrives at the office to collect all of the other mail, hence the reason to
have a ‘Cut off time as if it was left until the office closed at 1730 hours, it would take
10 or 15 minutes to then amalgamate the cheques and other daily work which would
mean the postman would be delayed, therefore all of the daily accounting work is
prepared a short time before the postman arrives so that when the office closes at

17:30 hours, the postmen merely have to empty the post box and be on their way.

Any cheques taken for transactions after the ‘Cut off time would be held in the Post
office until the following day when the process would start all over again. As stated
before all cheques must be despatched daily regardiess of which type of transaction it
has been accepted for, this includes Bureau de Change transactions.

I mentioned earlier that the cheques are to be despatched daily apart from Wednesday,
this is because Wednesday evening is the Post Office’s ‘Balancing’ day. Every
Wednesday evening after the Post Office closes for business to the public the accounts
for that week must to brought to account and a ‘balance’ performed, which is basically a
verification of transactions and sales performed that week together with a verification of
the money accepted at the counter. In order to perform this task the Horizon computer
system is used which can provide you with breakdowns of various types of transactions
etc, it also provides you with a breakdown of what stock and cash the office should hold
at the end of business on Wednesday evening and then it is a process of physically
checking the amount of stock and cash held in the office and comparing it with what the
Horizon computer system says you should have.

All of the information relating to the weekly office balance fs transferred automatically by
the Horizon computer system onto a weekly cash account document, which is then
printed off. The cash account document shows a summary of all of the transactions
conducted that week, the amount of stock and cash on hand and a host of other
accounting figures. These accounting figures basically fall into two categories, either
Receipts or Payment, for instance if a customer had paid in an amount of money into
their Girobank account, this would be classed as a receipt and would form part of the
total value recorded in the receipts section of the cash account.

Continuation of statement of MANISH PATEL

If the Post office paid out a pension to a customer then this would be classed as a
payment and would form part of the total value recorded in the payments section of the
cash account. By comparing the total figure obtained in the Receipts sections with that
obtained in the payments section we are able to determine if a ‘Balance’ has been
reached. If the two figures are identical than the office is said to have ‘Balanced’
exactly, if however the figure obtained for receipts is higher than that obtained for
payments then the account has not balanced and a surplus is recorded on the cash
account on page 1 under the discrepancies table and similarly if the receipts figure is
lower than the payments figure than a shortage must be declared on the cash account.

Upon competition of the cash account, two cash account documents are printed off,
both should be signed by the Postmaster or office manager to signify that they are a
true and accurate record of the office accounts, they should also be datestamped and
then one copy is retained at the office and the other is forwarded to the accounts
sections in Chesterfield where it is archived for a period of time.

As the Post Office performs the office balance on Wednesday evening after close of
business, there is not a ‘Cut off time on Wednesday's and therefore any cheques taken
on Wednesday right up to the point of when the office closes would be included in the
office balance. As the office balance is performed after closing no documentation is
despatched that night including the cheque envelope, it is normal for the Post Office
outlets to retain the cheque envelope and other daily accounting documentation until
the following morning (Thursday) when they would be collected by the postman on the
moming collection. Wednesday's are the only time when it is appropriate not to
despatch the cheques taken on that day and can be held over until the following
morning after the office has been balanced.

Hence the date, which appears on the BCV, should be the date when the cheques were

delay in submitting the’ GRO _

An examination of this schedule shows that in the majority of cases,’ GRO

would purchase an amount of euros from Rugeley Post Office and later on the same
day, he would sell the same number or sometimes a lesser amount of euros to the
other Bureau de Change outlets. Indeed by examining the time recorded for the
purchase of euros from the Post Office as shown on schedule MP/3 to the various
exhibits produced by Pippa Barker of Thomas Cook Retail Limited, which also record
the time the euros were sold to their outlet, it can be seen that in a number of cases the
sale occurs within an hour or two of the purchase from Rugeley Post Office.

To illustrate, the first entry on schedule MP/4 shows that GRO _ I purchased
40,000 euros on Saturday 9" March 2002. The cheque used for payment was dated
8" March 2002 (Friday) and made out for an amount of £23,323.62; this cheque was

left the Post Office premises until 14" March 2002. However in that same time period,

' GRO ‘having sold the euros he had purchased in those 3 days to Thomas
Cook Reiail, received funds worth £95,769.54, which had been credited to his Bank
account, nothing had been debited from his account for the payment of those euros to

There are a number of anomalies, which arise from the data contained in this schedule,
which I will address later in this statement.

At the time of the audit of Rugeley Post Office on Tuesday 14” January 2003, I was
made aware that included in the overall office shortage of £645,345.18 was a figure of
£282,000.00 which was the difference found by the auditors in the ‘AM’ stock unit. The
‘AM’ stock unit has since been confirmed by Mr Page himself to be his main stock unit.

At the time there was also a single cheque in the Bureau de Change till for an amount
of £278,181.82, part of exhibit NUW/5 and therefore this cheque and more importantly
the amount became associated with the £282,000.00 shortage in the AM stock unit.
However following questioning of Mr Page during the PACE interviews, Mr Page stated

heque for £278,181.82 was a replacement cheque given to him by

early in 2003 to replace three (3) cheques which! = GRO had used

istmas 2002 period at Rugeley Post office to purchase euros, exhibit MP/1,
which had all ‘bounced’. With that being the case the single cheque for £278,181.82
should not have formed any part of the office balance and should not have been taken
into account by the audit team, however, at that time, I nor anyone else was aware of
the explanation Mr Page would give in relation to this cheque. That single cheque
therefore was being held by Mr Page in the Bureau de Change till until the three (3)
‘pounced’ cheques (which came to exactly the same amount) were returned to the
office in the form of an error notice, a method used by the Post Office accounting
section to advise Post office outlets of any accounting errors which need to be rectified.

From what Mr Page has told me during interview, once he had received the error notice

in relation to the three (3) bounced cheques he would have then submitted the single
cheque for £278,181.82 to rectify the error.

When I became aware of this explanation, I began to examine the Post Office
documentation more closely as this meant that the single cheque for £278,181.82
should not have formed any part of the accounts at Rugeley Post Office on Tuesday
14" January 2003 and therefore there was an unidentified loss of £282,000.00 in the
‘AM’ stock unit.

Examination of the audit result and specificaily exhibits KO/G1 and DAE/O5 show that
the £282,000.00 difference in the ‘AM’ stock unit was in relation to a figure recorded in
the AM stock unit for Foreign Currency. The ‘AM’ stock unit as agreed by Mr Page
during interview was the main Post Office safe (two safes) located in Mr Page's office
and would have contained various amounts of bulk cash and stock. When the auditor's
examined these safes and verified their contents on 14" January 2003, they did not find
£282,000.00 worth of foreign currency located in the ‘AM’ stock unit, indeed there was
no foreign currency at all in the AM stock unit, the only foreign currency found at the
Post Office that day was all contained within the Bureau de Change till insert.

As the discrepancy in the AM stock unit related to foreign currency the auditors decided
to electronically transfer that shortage to the Bureau till (BU stock unit) using the
Horizon computer system, in order to keeps things neat, hence exhibit DAE/05

The Bureau till (BU stock unit) had already shown a shortage as the five (5) cheques,
exhibit NJW/5, had been seized from the till by the Police the day before. What wasn’t
known at the time is that the fifth cheque, the one for an amount of £278,181.82 had
not been entered into the Forde Moneychanger or the Horizon system and was merely
sitting in the bureau till awaiting the three bounced cheques and the error notice from

the Post Office accounting section in Chesterfield at which time it would have been
brought to account as stated by Mr Page.

The four (4) other cheques, which form part of exhibit, NJW/5 in total equate to
£360,493.83 and were the four cheques used by GRO Hor the transaction
conducted on Monday 13” January 2003 and had been entered into the Forde
Moneychanger. As a result taking the figure for the four cheques of £360,493.83 and
adding to this the £282,000.00 of foreign currency said to be in the AM stock unit we
obtain a figure of £642,493.83, with other smaller discrepancies found in the accounts

the final overall office shortage was £645,345.18. This figure is not based on taking the
single £278,181.82 cheque into account, as it had not been entered into any of the
accounts at Rugeley Post Office, either on the Forde Moneychanger or the Horizon
system. However at the time of the audit and possibly due to the similarities of the two
amounts, £278,181.82 and £282,000.00, the two were linked and it was not realised at
the time that there was in fact an actual shortage of the ‘AM’ stock unit of £282,000.00.

As a result I began to examine the previous Cash accounts for Rugeley Post Office and
the under copy Command 10 summary printouts. I obtained a number of weekly Cash
accounts from Rugeley Post Office, and those that I could not recover from the Office
itself, I obtained duplicate copies from the accounting section in Chesterfield.

I now produce the following weekly cash account documents in relation to Rugeley Post

in week 50 (w/e 06.03.02), the office cash account states that there was £133,340.07 in
sterling cash, physically on the premises at close of Business on Wednesday 06.03.02.
it also states that there was £15,255.02 sterling equivalent of foreign Currency
physically on the premises at close of Business on Wednesday 06.03.02.

Examination of the relevant Forde Moneychanger Command 10 summary printout for
week 50, part of exhibit item number MEP/1, the ‘Cash Held’ figure also shows the
sterling value of £15,255.02 as it should do and therefore there is no inflation of the
amounts declared.

Between week 50 (w/e 06.03.02) and week 12 (w/e19.06.02) the figures declared as
Foreign Currency (sterling value) on the cash account match those shown on the
Command 10 summary printout apart from 3 of those weeks (weeks 51, 01 &10), in
weeks 51 and 10 the difference (inflation) matches the declared revaluation figure on

input those weeks figures into the Horizon Computer system mistakenly added the
tevaluations figure to the Cash Held figure and entered this figure into the Horizon
Computer system. As for week 01, this was different by 40 pence, which is likely to
have been a keying in error.

During those weeks it can be seen that the sterling equivalent of Foreign Currency
physically held at the office on Wednesday evening remained between £3,000 and
£38,000, whilst the Cash On hand figure ranged from £133,000.00 to £365,000.00, with
the majority being in the upper £200,000 to lower £300,000 area.

in week 13 (w/e 26.06.02), there was an Audit carried out at Rugeley Post Office and
as stated to me by Mr Page during interview, he was not present at the time of the audit
as he was holidaying in Euro Disney, however, Mr Page did contact the office by
telephone numerous times that day and spoke to both his staff and members of the
audit team. It would appear that the Office accounts had not been completed when the
audit team went into the office on Thursday 27" June 2002 and therefore the audit
team spent most of their time completing the office accounts rather than carrying out a
verification of those accounts.

Subsequently between week 14 (w/e 03.07.02) and 16 (w/e 17.07.02) there are a
couple of discrepancies the 1 for just under £5,000 in week 14, and then just under
£50,000 in week 16 with a Nil inflation in week 15. The large discrepancy caused in
week 16 is due to the revaluation figure having being used by someone at the office to
feed into the Horizon computer system rather than the ‘Cash Held’ figure.

in week 17 (wile 24.07.02) the Cash on hand figure declared is £421,791.72, indeed
over the month of July 2002 the cash on Hand figures have all been over the
£400,000.00 jevel. The Foreign Currency on hand figure declared on the cash account

is £6,683.95, which is identical to the figure declared on the appropriate Command 10
summary printout.

The following week, week number 18 (w/e 31.07.02) the cash on Hand figure reduces
to £87,162.07, the Foreign currency on hand figure increases to £191,095.97 whilst the
appropriate Command 10 summary for that week indicated that the Cash Held figure
was 13,595.97, a difference of £177,500.00.

Whilst conducting this investigation it became known to me that during week 18 an
amount of cash, £160,000.00, was despatched from Rugeley Post Office back to the
Cash Centre on the instruction of a Retail Line Manager, Mr Stephen Cartwright. Mr
Cartwright and Mr Douglas Brown explain the reasons behind this course of action in
their respective statements.

Subsequently there is a difference of £85,636.65 in week 19 (w/e 07.08.02) followed by
two further weeks, weeks 20 & 21 (w/e 14.08.02 & 21.08.02) where there is no
difference in Foreign currency declared values to the Command 10 summary figure.
However from week 22 (w/e 28.08.02) through to week 41 (w/e 08.01.03) which is the
last full cash account period whilst Mr Page was in charge of the office, there is a
steady inflation each week commencing with an inflation of £188,000.00 (week 22) and
reaching £282,000.00 in week 41, which is also the exact amount indicated as Foreign
Currency in the ‘AM’ stock unit on the day of the Audit, 14” January 2003, item number
KO/01 refers.

Throughout this same period the Cash on Hand figures declared on the cash account
remain lower than previously, being in the £40,000.00 to £160,000.00 bracket, when
previously they had reached levels in excess of £400,000.00 and the Foreign Currency
on hand declared on the cash accounts jumps from between £3,000 to £38,000 prior to

week number 18 to between £100,000.00 to £450,000.00.

The evidence as borne out by the Command 10 summary printouts from week number
18 (w/e 31.07.02) onwards suggests that whoever fed in the value for Foreign Currency
on Hand into the Horizon computer system at the end of each cash account week, input
false figures and inflated these figures by several hundred thousand pounds at a time,
leading the Post Office to believe that a higher value of foreign currency was physically
held at Rugeley Post Office when in fact it wasn’t, as borne out by the evidence of the
audit on Tuesday 14" January 2003 when £282,000.00 worth of foreign currency was
said to be held within ‘AM’ stock unit though was physically not there.

This inflation of the Forde Moneychanger Cash held figures seems to have started in
week number 18, which in itself may be of relevance as that is the same week when Mr
Stephen Cartwright personally oversaw the removal of £160,000.00 from Rugeley Post
Office as ihe Post Office matrix team had considered that the office was holding too
much cash and had made attempts to have some of it returned without success.

Also if you compare the figures before week 18, for instance weeks 14 to 16, if you add
the cash on hand figure (column 3) to the Foreign Currency on Hand figure (column 4)
you obtain a figure of roughly £425,000.00 to £465,000.00. This declaration suggests
that at the end of the relevant cash account week, the office physically had on the
premises, that value in cash, whether that be in sterling or foreign currency.

After week 18, from week 22 onwards, if you perform the same addition you still obtain
values in the £320,000.00 to £500,000.00 bracket mark, however these figures include
the inflated values in the declared foreign currency and so ff the inflation is subtracted
from the overall value, the values drop to between £130,000.00 to £270,000.00. By
adding an inflated value to these figures they can be brought back to the level pre week

number 18 before any cash was actually removed from Rugeley Post Office.

During one of the PACE interviews I had with Mr Page on Wednesday 23” April 2003, I
questioned him briefly about the £282,000.00 figure in the AM stock unit and was
informed by Mr Page that the figure on the Command 10 printout only related to the
currency held within the Bureau till, therefore for example the Command 10 printout
may say £50,000, which would mean that within the Bureau till itself there was various
amounts of currency giving a total sterling value of £50,000. However, Mr Page the

suggests that he would be holding an additional amount (mainly the Euros fo

in his main safe, which is known as AM stock and this is why there are two

“different figures, one on the Command 10 summary printout and a different value on

would be held in his main safe (‘AM’ stock unit) and

Having keyed these entries into the Forde Moneychanger the associated value of

whether most of it was held in the main safe or nat, indeed £200,000.00 worth of euros
would probably not have fitted into the Bureau till.

The Post Office at Rugeley used a number of Stock units, to identify them, for instance
those used by the counter staff were given alphabetical/numerical letters to distinguish
them, i.e. stock unit AA or 01 etc. As mentioned previously the Bureau till was labelled
and identified as stock unit BU and Mr Page had his own stock unit labelled and
identified as Stock unit AM.

Once the Currency received from Hemel Hempstead had been keyed into the Forde
Moneychanger, as clearly it was being, as indicated on schedule MP/82, the value of
the BU stock unit would increase by that amount ‘booked’ in. No other stock units
would increase in value even if the euros themselves were placed in the main safe, AM
stock unit. For the value to increase in the AM stock unit an operator would be required
to manually key that value into the Horizon computer system and associated it with the
AM stock unit.

Since all of the currency being received from Hemel Hempstead was being correctly
keyed into the Forde Moneychanger it could not be booked in under AM stock unit as
well. Furthermore if an amount of currency had not been ‘booked’ into the Forde
Moneychanger then the command 10 weekly summary could not illustrate correctly how
much currency had been sold during the course of the week as the Forde
Moneychanger would not be ‘aware’ of the existence of other currency held in the Post
Office as it had not been ‘booked’ into the system.

For instance in week 42 (week commencing 09.01.03), schedule MP/82 shows that on
Thursday 9" January 2003 at 10:47 hours, 150,000 euros with a sterling value of
£92,177.23 was ‘booked’ into the Forde Moneychanger. On the following day, Friday

44 transactions where notes (currency) had been bought amounting to a sterling value

Whilst the 5” tape cassette was being loaded into the machine in readiness to continue
the interview, Mr Farrington, the solicitor stated that he had an evening engagement
and also that the cleaners would lock up the offices at 19:00 hours and he had left his
set of keys at home therefore he felt that we could not continue the interview any
further.

As a result I started the fifth tape at 18:54 hours just to capture the reasons behind the
termination of the interview, which then concluded at 18:57 hours. Mr Page did state
both on the 5" tape and after the end of the interview that he was happy to continue
with a voluntary interview at a later date and indeed wished to arrange a date there and
then, however, Mr Farrington interjected and stated that he would let us know in due

euros has been debited from his bank account.

This pattern follows throughout the six weeks covered on schedule MP/79 and indeed
throughout the period under investigation.

During the course of the interview with Mr Page, he had claimed that he or his staff
would on occasions when the Post Office ran short of foreign currency, go along to the
local Co-op Travel shop and purchase the required currency from them, bringing the
currency back to the Post Office and transferring it into the Forde Moneychanger before
selling it to the customer.

Both Mrs M Pearce and Ms Batey, staff members employed at Rugeley Post Office
have confirmed the practice of purchasing foreign currency from the local Co-op Travel
shop when the Post Office was running low of a certain type of currency. Both had also
attended the Co-op store themselves to conduct these transactions.

Furthermore, I have obtained a statement from Mrs Gwen Talbot, the foreign exchange
cashier employed at the Rugeley Co-op Travel store, who has also confirmed the
practice of Rugeley Post Office purchasing foreign currency from their outlet. I
requested Mrs Talbot to extract from their archives all of the documentation relating to
the sale of foreign currency to Rugeley Post Office between the beginning of 2002
through to 13" January 2003.

Subsequently Mrs Talbot handed to me copies of all of the transactions she could find
relating to the sale of foreign currency to Rugeley Post Office over the period specified,
the originals, item number GT/1 were retained by Mrs Talbot. Using the information
contained on the sales receipts GT/1, I compiled a schedule, which I now produce as
item number MP/100 illustrating the various dates and amounts involved. As can be

seen from the schedule, there are a number of different types of currency purchased
from the Co-op store and those concerning euros have been highlighted. When the
dates of the euros purchased from the Co-op are compared to the Buy Notes
transaction schedule, item number MP/5, there are still a far greater number in terms of
volume and value of buy backs which do not correspond fo the dates or amounts when
the euros where bought from the Co-op store.

selling euros for during specific dates during 2002, namely the dates listed on. schedule

MP/3, i.e. the date: ! GRO I had purchased euros from Rugeley Post Office.
When Mrs Talbot had extracted a sales receipt relating to euros for the particular date

in question from their archived records, I kept a copy of it, though entered the exchange
rate onto another schedule, which I now produce as item number MP/101, labelled Co-
op Travel Rugeley — Euro exchange rate. The copy sales receipts used for this
exercise now form part of the unused material.

Subsequently I have also examined the Bureau sales figures for a main Branch Post
Office located in Swansea, which also has a high level of foreign currency sales. I have
extracted the sales figures from week number 1 (w/e 03.04 02) to week number 45 (w/e
05.02.03). This schedule indicates the revaluation ratio, which have remained between
+8 to +12 percent throughout the period and as indicated by Mr H Stacey in his
statement, the accepted boundaries for revaluation ratios should be between +7 and
+12 percent for a normally operated Post Office. I now produce this schedule as item
number MP/102.

Subsequently, I requested Mr L Hutchins, the Foreign Currency Manager at Hemel
Hempstead to provide me with all of the wholesale exchange rates for euro purchased
from FRTS since 1% March 2002 to 31" January 2003. I received from Mr Hutchins a

By using this schedule and my own schedule MP/3, I have compiled another schedule,

which I now produce as it MP/104. This schedule compares the sterling

i using both the wholesale rate supplied to the
Post Office (Hemel Hempstead) and the exchange rates applied by Mr Page.

The dates indicated on schedule MP/3 relate to when the transaction was conducted

GRO land therefore in order to carry out this exercise, the wholesale rate

witl

I have used for comparison purposes is the rate on the day before the sale.

For instance the 1% entry on schedule MP/3 is Saturday 9" March 2002, I have
therefore used the wholesale exchange rate form LGH/05 for Friday 8° March 2002
(1.6137) as the euros would have been despatched to Rugeley Post Office on the 8" to
arrive and be sold on the 9". In most cases the wholesale rate I have used is that of
the day before the sale apart from sales made-on Mondays when the wholesale rate for
Friday would have been used, also when bank holidays have affected the deliveries.

This schedule shows the day & date on which the transactions took place, the amount

value, the exchange rate applied by Mr Page to the sale of those euros and again the

For instance on 9" March 2002, FRTS supplied euros to the Post Office at an
exchange rate of 1.6137, using 40,000 euros for comparison purposes that amounts to_
a sterling value of £ 24,787.75, which is what the Post Office paid to FRTS. jer

So the Post Office having bought the euros at a wholesale rate from FRTS, still lost £

1,464.13 from that sale alone based purely on the wholesale rates, which does not take

into account any profit margins at all, with those taken into account the loss was as
shown on schedule MP/3 (£2,023.32).
