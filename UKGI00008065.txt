Stephen - please could you send this sub the Andrew G's office please, copying spads and Clark (and Perm Sec and the
others below).

When sending please can you note it's for information, note it's been reviewed by the perm secs and his response,
and prod them about meeting the GC. Whilst it might take some time to get that meeting in the diary, the very fact of
asking her to come in will send a message to POL.

Thanks

Hi Richard,

Thank you for producing this. Alex has read the note and said that everything seems to be correct in terms of
handling. He has asked that he be briefed alongside Andrew Griffiths by POL’s General Council (see para 24). Let us
know when the meeting might take place and we can coordinate on timings.

Thanks,

Please find attached a submission on the Post Office Horizon litigation case. This is a factual briefing to give Alex the
background to the case. We intend to submit further advice, planned for next week, on a protocol between BEIS,
UKGI and POL to keep the Department informed of events, and also to provide more clarity on POL’s QC’s views of the
case.

Kind regards
Richard
