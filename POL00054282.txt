Dear Penny

Thank you for your Email today. What has been requested through Mark Dinsdale is transaction log
details for West Byfleet (this is the whole of the false accounting period to which Ms Misra has
pleaded guilty to) from 1 December 2006 to 31 December 2007. This should then be given to Gareth
Jenkins at Fujitsu to confirm by his witness statement whether there are any errors within the Horizon
system for the transaction log period.

Gareth Jenkins will need to study the Defence expert's reports which he has in hi
lengthy discussions with the Defence expert Charles McLachlan (mobile number;
12 February 2010. There is a need for an urgent meeting where these two expert ere
the Defence expert reports and his concerns about the Horizon system can be discussed. Gareth
Jenkins can then use his expertise to rebut or answer his various hypotheses or theories. He has
done that to a certain extent in his telephone discussion with him on 12 February 2010.

It may be the practical approach for Gareth Jenkins to find the shortest period span of transaction log
data for West Byfleet, analyse it, disprove or rebut what the Defence expert is saying in his reports.
Mr Gareth Jenkins is an expert for Fujitsu. He will give evidence in Court. The Judge and Jury will be
listening to his every word very carefully and a lot will hang on his evidence.

itis imperative that Gareth Jenkins arrange a meeting with the Defence expert today or tomorrow.
The he needs to prepare a detailed report for the trial.

If I can assist in anyway, please do not hesitate to contact me.
