Executive summary — Where we make money

= The PSG team has worked closely with Post Office Finance team to depict a picture of product and
channel profitability based on existing Post Office data

= As per last Board meeting, we are presenting product profitability using “Contribution”, a new
profitability view developed by the PO Finance team, which splits total overheads between “True”
overheads (e.g., finance, HR and legal) and Allocated Indirects (e.g., CIO and DMB costs, which are
otherwise part of total overheads)

= Channel profitability is presented on trading profit terms

= The analysis drives several insights:

Services is top contribution driver IRRELEVANT ‘with best contribution margin" I IRRELEVAI

Summary of OHI findings and their potential uses

Diagnostic headlines
= Impressive level of engagement with the survey
= Bottom quartile organisational health indicating significant opportunity for improvement

= Accountability, work environment and motivation relative strengths (though still third quartile): relatively more effective in creating a
sense of community and belonging; practices around openness, trust, engaging leadership and ownership amongst most emphasised

= Purpose and direction not clearly understood, reinforcing need for current work on Purpose, Strategy & Growth
= Lack of consistent measurement and management of business and risk, or acting to address problems

= Lack of institutional skills and talent, external orientation and innovation/learning

= Overall, senior managers’ views most critical (especially innovation and learning)

= Current values centre around community, being of service, care and respect, but also hierarchy and bureaucracy; whereas desired
values include competitiveness, accountability, efficiency and being well organised

= Main purpose themes at Post Office are about being a trusted brand, with access for all, serving customer’s mails, parcel and cash
needs

Uses of the OHI findings
= Syndicate the results internally to increase understanding of the challenges (both generally and for particular parts of the organisation)
= Start to create a narrative about the required change building on the quantitative and qualitative detail of the survey results
= Use the detailed information about where practices need to change to inform concrete improvement initiatives
= Once Purpose, Strategy & Growth are clearer, use OHI results to inform what is needed to enable the new strategy
= Track progress and course correct where/if needed

The OHI survey digs deep to understand what’s happening under the surface and
provide a detailed picture of organisational health

Employee Engagement survey Organisational Health Index (OHI)

= Evaluates individual employee happiness / = Evaluates an organisation’s long-term

attitudes (e.g. how employees feel) capacity to perform

= Helps identify employee “hot buttons”. = Identifies strengths and opportunities
(e.g., satisfaction, happiness, morale, across a robust set of management
engagement, work environment) practices proven to drive health

= Allows customisation and comparison * Enables benchmarking across industries,

based on unique questions / lines of inquiry regions and a global database

= Focuses on manager level reporting vs. " Focuses on enterprise-wide, functional
enterprise-wide focus areas and business unit insights to inform
actions to improve health

In practice, employee engagement and the OHI are complementary; however a healthy

organisation is not justabouthappy.employeés, but also.aligning the workforceyand
behaviors with the organisation goals

Next steps on OHI

* Continue sharing survey results with relevant Post Office groups

* Start shaping the interventions to improve organisational health by
identifying which management practices can be improved via
workshops with L40 (session on 10 December), GE, etc.

* As the strategy work continues to be refined, ensure focus on
improving the management practices that are most relevant to
delivering that strategy

Executive summary — postal market overview

" Postal players have been under increasing pressure. Several trends contribute to this:
= Structural and irreversible decline of the mail business

= Customers demanding higher convenience and service in the core products offered by postal
players, while often not being willing to pay higher prices (especially B2C e-commerce parcel
senders)

= Disruptors are winning the postal players’ natural new growth segments (e.g. parcels and
financial services), in particular Amazon

= Regulatory pressure to maintain retail network coverage and USO requirements continue
impacting postal players’ economics; although most European players still enjoy some form of
subsidy

Executive summary — learnings from postal players

There are three pillars of learnings from other post players:

1. Winning in competitive growth areas requires adapting the retail network structure to better serve consumers
(e.g., DHL’s dense parcelshop network provides convenience to its e-commerce receivers)

—  Multi-tiered networks allow for improved economics without compromising on sales and convenience

2. Growing the top-line through non-core, third-party products usually fails to create sizeable revenue
streams. Most sizable growth areas are parcels and financial services. Sales performance programmes as
well as targeted incentives can be effective growth levers

3. Remaining competitive with a lean cost base requires consolidating footprint and different approaches to
ownership (e.g., franchise, dealers)

— Automation in selected areas, both in customer-facing activities and in in-store operations, is a key
lever to improve customer experience in a cost-effective manner, culminating in the “unmanned branch”
(Singapore, Finland)

— Strong partnerships with retailers (e.g. in Canada) have been successful, based on standardised
master franchise arrangements and clear understanding of economic benefits of having a post office (e.g.
15% sales uplift for retail)

4) Portugal’s CTT has moved up the FS value chain from distribution to creating
and broadening the product offering

Where CTT started

pe ctt

= In 2015, Banco CTT was created as legal
entity with banking license provided by Bank
of Portugal

= Prior to this, CTT offered very limited
financial services

= CTT had a very strong existing mass market
postal customer base

= The initial approach was for a low risk
balance sheet strategy

Dedicated counter space

) Key developments

The bank focuses on the mass market,

offering simple, transactional products

— Principles of fairness, transparency,
low cost

Lending began as an intermediary, in

partnership with Cetelem

— It is gradually increasing its
exposure to credit risk and
broadening the product range

The initial 51 branches have expanded to

~200, built off CTT’s postal network

— Branches have either multifunction
counters (with postal), dedicated
counters, or dedicated space

Digital focused

»») Outcome

= Strong customer growth, and move to breakeven (2015
v 3Q16):

Net loans 3.0

= Aggressive branch growth I Dedicated space

(2) Successful postal peers transformed their branches in multi- tiered networks to
allow sales, convenience and lower cost

@ Sales focus
Large offices with a wide range of services

Primary goal is to provide the highest quality service and ensure a positive
brand perception

@ Service focus
Mid-sized offices with an optimal set of services

Primary goal is to provide fast, efficient and high-quality of large volumes of
transactions

© Local Access
Small offices with a narrow range of core services

Primary goal is meet the accessibility criteria/social needs or provide a response
to the competition

@ Direct Channels

Aset of alternative channels provides more options to the customer and increases the
quality of customer service — mainly websites, mobile applications, call centers

(3) “Lessons learned” from other postal services companies yield several insights for
POL direction

@ Every post has made attempts to grow outside the core in “adjacent” markets. The vast majority of these
efforts has failed to create either sizeable revenue streams (more than £20m per annum) or profits. E.g.,
mailroom management, ID validation, secure email, digital letterbox, document archiving, warehousing, postie

add on services (meter reading) etc
@ The successes have been primarily from legacy assets, in particular growth of financial services and
mobile (e.g., Poste Italiane), as well as parcel markets

© Other posts have, in general, failed to incubate new businesses organically. There have been some
successes in making acquisitions, especially in two areas:

= Rollup of other express or parcel operators (DHL Express in Europe, UPS and Fedex globally)

= Acquisition of businesses which have subsequently been run at arm’s length in order to preserve different
culture and people processes e.g. Deutsche Post acquisition of digital marketing boutiques Nugg and Admail

4) Branch-specific incentive practices can lift sales

Best practices at retail banks

POL00447762

POL00447762

RETAIL BANKING EXAMPLE

Examples at postal operators

= Pay out incentives frequently and more often to create
right frontline motivation

= Create gradual incentives to drive growth — don’t create
strong step function

= Ensure employees clearly understand how their
incentives tie to overall goals of the institution

" Prioritize strategic objectives (e.g., tiered quotas)

= Drive collaboration amongst sales teams (e.g., group
bonus)

= Use leverage in financial incentives to drive appropriate
employee behavior

= Provide attractive non-cash incentives to conveys
importance and special appreciation

= Build loyalty to the company through unique and culture-
specific awards

EU postal
incumbent

Incentivizes to postal clerks by providing possibility to become
financial advisor in case of stellar performance

Recruits and manages postal banking staff as in banks:
employees specialize in products, they are in charge of a client
portfolio, there is separation of staff for retail and corporate
banking staff, incentivized for sales

services and telecommunication sales staff

Overview

Q

Insights
for POL

Shoppers Drug Mart, a franchised organisation itself,
owns ~50% of Canada Post franchised branches

Canada Post agrees a framework with Shoppers Drug
Mart but actual contract is signed on a store-by-store
basis — very specific formal contract with standard
terms and pricing

The Master Franchisee is responsible for paying most of
the setup cost, i.e., standard fit-out, staging and
equipment

The relationship between Canada Post and Shoppers
Drug Mart is renewed every 5 years

Although Master Franchise models create a leaner agent
servicing structure, larger contract management teams
are required to ensure consistency among franchisees

Fixed period contracts allow the franchised
organisation to update arrangement terms if desired,
making it easier to change franchise strategy
