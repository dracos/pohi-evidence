Subject: FW: Meeting with the experts - 14th July ?

V'll do an email on this. It’s ridiculous. I asked weeks ago for a timetable to take this forward. I also told Martin to fix
a date for the meeting this week before we’re both away.

Jane is getting tetchy with them too, and asked me to put together an email highlighting all the things they’re doing
for us and the time it’s taking. 1’ll finish that tomorrow - could I run it by you for your views?

Jessica,
POL00318159
POL00318159

Rodric, Simon Clarke and I previously agreed that it would be useful to have a meeting with the
experts in order to kick start the report process and bring it back on track. We suspected that POL
IT and/or Fujitsu had provided the experts with information directly and in those circumstances
neither POL nor ourselves had an exhaustive list of the material provided.

Given the nature of the material which the experts are believed to have seen and the counter
training which they are understood to have also received, it is hoped that the experts may be able
to provide preliminary views with regard to the system and comment/ observations with regard to
the remaining work to be carried out.

Ihave heard from Rodric that he will be away until 23" July. Would you like me to make
arrangements for the meeting to take place following his return?

Kind regards,
Martin.

Dear Rodric and Jessica,
I would be grateful if you could let me know whether you would be able to meet the experts on
14" July - if so I will confirm the position with ICL before other commitments are put in the

experts diaries.

If 14" July is not a possibility, I understand that both experts are currently available on 21° and
22” July.

Kind regards,

Martin

Dear Rodric and Jessica

I understand that both Prof. Kramer and Dr. Dulay would be able to attend a meeting on 14" July

So far as the location of the meeting is concerned, could this take place at POL?

Kind regards,
