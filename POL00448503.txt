Re Project Pineapple .msa

Dear all

Ahead of our call on Thursday, please see email below and attached copy of the Voice
of the Postmaster Press Release for January, together witha letter addressed to me.

In addition, please see attached a file note I prepared following my conversation with Saf
and Elliot on Sunday — they have agreed last night that I could share with you. They
were very supportive of Nick, but you will see that the VOP have made negative
statements about Nick .

Let's talk about this on Thursday and to note I have not yet responded to VoP regarding
their request for a meeting.

Regards,
Henry

Hi Henry
This echoes very much the comments that we discussed on Sunday - clearly we
are not losing the plot and real action is essential.
