NOTES

General — Interpretation of the above matrix

The columns headed ‘Incident’ define the incidents which the Defences and AIC
Detection are designed to address.

The columns headed ‘Defences’ summarise the defences which have (or will be) put in
place to deal with the relevant incidents. In some cases it will be seen that there is
more than one category of defence. These are additive layers of system resilience,
and should be interpreted as follows:

If there is a root cause fix, then defensive code, if also present, would not be exercised
unless either the root cause fix was found in some circumstances to be ineffective or
another hitherto undiscovered root cause caused the same symptom. Taking for
another hitherto Und cove e eon ea

example A6, the cause of the missing timestamp underlying the reported incident has
been fixed, and so the second defence (the repair of the defective record by the

harvester) is inactive, but would be activated by some new "bug" which also caused a
missing timestamp.

The harvester rejection is described as a defence because it prevents defective errors
reaching TIP. If there is either a root cause fix or defensive code then the harvester
will not reject the record, as records reaching the harvester will be correct. The
harvester would reject the record if the fix failed (and indeed for most transaction
errors did originally reject the records, which was how the error was detected by TIP).

The columns headed ‘AIC detection’ set out the reaction the AIC would have made to
the various categories of reported errors had it been active at the time. Where these
errors have been either fixed or defended against the AIC will of course not now have
anything to detect. The third defence, harvester rejection, itself causes AIC detection.
as quite apart from anything else which the AIC may have detected it will now also
detect that a record which was present at the counter has not reached the host.

were in the message store were correctly bought to account.

centrally introduced migration correction not being harvested to TIP, although the
cash account was corrected as requested by POCL.

Root cause was incomplete definition of signage agreed between Pathway and TIP,

now complete.

"Defences" - definitions of terms used as column headings.

The intended purpose of each of the defensive measures referred to in the column
headings is described in the definitions below.

Root cause fix means a software fix applied to rectify the cause of the incidents
reported by TIP in the relevant categories.

Preventative Code means code added to the Horizon software either to detect and
prevent an inappropriate user action (such as deletion of an active stock unit) which
would have adverse system consequences, or to detect a system error (such as a null
cash account id) and prevent the effects of that error propagating through the system.

Harvester Record Rejection refers to the action taken by the software agent which
harvests records to be sent to TIP when it detects a record as being in error. In this
circumstance the agent refuses to harvest the record, instead reporting it for

investigation and/or correction.

7 AIC Detection - definition of terms used as column headings:

The checks performed by each part of the AIC software will be as defined in
PI/DES/002, which was re-issued at v0.8 on 22/12/99. This adds to v0.7 a new
section 4.6.5, which describes the test performed by the host AIC software to detect
and report on instances when the cash account payments table total does not equal the
cash account receipts table total.

Daily checks at the counter refers to the error reporting performed daily by the counter
software (by writing error messages in the message store for central recovery and
reporting) as distinct from the daily production of control totals for subsequent use
either by the host or by the weekly counter AIC processes. This reporting is described
in PI/DES/002, particularly within sections 3.2, 4.1.3, and 4.3.4.

Reported by the Harvester refers to the daily error reporting by the harvester agent, for
those outlets where an End of Day marker is present, when records are found which
cannot be harvested for onwards transmission to TIP because they fail validation
checks. This reporting is described in PI/DES/002, particularly within sections 4.4.1,
and 4.3.4.

Daily checks at the Host refers to reporting of errors detected when the host AIC
software checks the data harvested for each outlet with the counter generated control
totals placed in the message store for this purpose. This reporting is described in
PI/DES/002, particularly within sections 3.1 and 4.5.1.

POL00083897

Weekly checks at the counter refers to the error reporting performed weekly by the

counter software (by writing error messages in the message store for central recovery
and reporting) as distinct from the production of weekly control totals for subsequent

and Teporting) as eee Se aaa oo
use by the host AIC processes. These errors may be detected by comparison of the
cash account to the control figures accumulated daily at the counter. This reporting

cash account tO oe eae ee
occurs every day, for those outlets for which a cash account has been produced and is
described in PI/DES/002, particularly within sections 3.2, 3.4, 4.1.2, 4.1.5, 4.2.3 and
4.3.5.

Weekly checks at the Host refers to reporting of errors detected when the host AIC
software checks the cash account sub-file for an outlet with the counter generated

software checks the cash account So
control totals placed in the message store for this purpose. This reporting occurs every

day, for those outlets for which a cash account has been produced and is described in
PI/DES/002, particularly within sections 3.3 and 4.5.2.

Receipts not equal to Payments check refers to reporting of errors detected when the
host AIC software checks the cash account sub-file for an outlet to ensure that the

host AIC software Cac cKs oe eae
totals for the Payments table and the Receipts table contained within the sub-file are
equal. This reporting is described in PI/DES/002, section 4.6.5.

8) The incidents shown as Pathway incidents Al6, B24 and B25 have been given
those designations for the purpose of this matrix and were not previously designated

by incident number.

notify POCL in accordance with procedures described in the CCD
entitled” TPS Reconciliation and Incident Management”
(CS/PRO/11); and

comply with those provisions of that CCD which shall be
inserted by reference to this paragraph 3.6.4.

Thereupon-Upon the Contractor’s giving notice in accordance with

(b) promptly issue to POCL a Manual Error Report in respect
of that Fransaction-E r-Gash- +-Data Error.

If the number of Fransaction-Data Errors;-Gash-Account Errors
and Gash Account-Imbalances which are discovered after the
transmission of the relevant record exceeds twenty in any Cash
Account Week the Contractor shall, in consultation with POCL,
review the process introduced by the Accounting Integrity
Control Release with a view to enhancing such process in order
to detect the relevant Transaction-Errors-or-Gash Aceount Data
Errors prior to transmission of the relevant records and to
identify and correct root causes of such errors. 7

Any & tion-E Gash Data Error processed by _I
the Contractor under paragraph 3.6.6.1(b) above which shall
have been discovered after transmission but before the
conclusion of the Cash Account Week in which it shall have
occurred shall count towards the 50 per Gash Account Week
limit under paragraph 3.6.5.4 above. However, where a

BS tion-Data Error or-Gash-A tE is discovered after
transmission and after the conclusion of the Cash Account Week
in which it shall have occurred the Contractor shall be entitled,
without thereby being in breach of paragraph 3.6.5.4 above, to
submit a Manual Error Report in respect thereof in accordance
with paragraph 3.6.6.1(b).

Where paragraph 3.6.6.1(a) above applies, the Contractor's

3.6.7

obligation to transmit a Repaired Cash Account may be satisfied
by transmitting such part of the Repaired Cash Account as is

The Contractor undertakes to use all reasonable endeavours, in accordance
with the procedures defined in the CCD entitled {—_} “TPS Reconciliation
and Incident Management” - CS/PRO/11, to notify POCL [(where [Ovhere possible)] of of
the occurrence of a Data Error or Not Data Error on the same day on which
such Data Error or Not Data Error occurs and shall in any event notify POCL
thereof on the morning following the date on which it occurs.

The Contractor undertakes to use all reasonable endeavours to ensure that:

3.6.9.1 the delay between the occurrence of a Data Error (or in the case I
of a Data Error detected after the transmission of the relevant
record, its detection) and (a) the issue of a Manual Error Report
in respect thereof to POCL, (b) transmission of the Repaired I
Transaction Data or (subject to paragraph 3.6.6.4) Repaired
Cash Account to POCL over the TIP interface or (c) (in the case
of a-Gash-Aecount Imbalance Data Error resulting in an I
Inaccurate Cash Account (without warning)) the issue of a
report to POCL pursuant to paragraph 3.6.5.2 above; or

3.6.9.2 the delay between discovery of a Not Data Error and the issue of I
a report to POCL in relation thereto under paragraph 3.6.7 above

shall not in either case exceed five working days.

I Where any such delay as is referred to in paragraph 3.6.8 has exceeded, or the I
“Contractor believes that it is likely to exceed, five days, the Contractor shall
immediately notify POCL’s Head of Service Management and shall procure that
the Contractor’s Customer Service Director (or, in his absence, the senior
manager in-charge-of his-responsibilities his deputy) is made available to meet
with POCL’s Head of Service Management (or his delegate) to discuss the delay
within two working Days of such notification.

Where the Contractor provides Manual Error Reports it shall provide a separate
Manual Error Report for each F tion-B Gash-A €DataError I
discovered. For this purpose, where a single error in a cash account is

manifested in more than one place in that cash account it shall be treated as a
single Gash Account-Data Error, but two or more different errors in the same I
cash account shall be treated as different Gash-Account-Data Errors, each
requiring a separate Manual Error Report.

3.6.12 Where the Contractor is required to make an assumption in order to correct a I

“Data Error and/or present Repaired Data, the Contractor shall make such

assumption and promptly inform POCL; prior-to-tra: ission-of the Repaired
Data; of the assumption made.

3.6.13_The Contractor shall pay to POCL within 30 days after the end of each month a
sum to compensate POCL for its costs in dealing with Manual Error Reports

reports for all-T: tion-Errors-and-GashAccount Data Errors as follows:
3.6.13.1 £150 per Manual Error Report relating to a Transaction Error

discovered after transmission of the relevant-date record;

3.6.13.2 £100 per Manual Error Report relating to a Transaction Error
discovered before transmission of the relevant record; and

3.6.13.3 £100 per Manual Error Report relating to a Cash Account Error
discovered; and

3.6.13.4 £100 per report issued in accordance with paragraph 3.6.5.2
relating to an Inaccurate Cash Account (without warning)

in that month. Clause 802 of the Codified Agreement shall apply to such
payments as though they were liquidated damages for failure to meet Service
Levels.

For the purposes of calculating the sum which may be due to be paid to POCL
under this paragraph 3.6.13 all Data Errors which shall have been corrected by
the Contractor and the relevant Repaired Transaction Data or (subject to
paragraph 3.6.6.4) Repaired Cash Account transmitted to POCL over the TIP
interface within five Working Days of such Data Error occurring shall be
excluded and no payment shall be made to POCL in relation to such Data
Errors. For the avoidance of doubt, no payment shall be made by the
Contractor to POCL in respect of error reports for-Gash-Aceount Imbalances
Inaccurate Cash Accounts (with warning).”
