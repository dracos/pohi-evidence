Helen,

I've discussed this with David X Gray who is one of the people in POL who is responsible for the Fujitsu relationship.

As you know, Fujitsu is a service provider which provides services to POL on an arms’ length basis. I'm not sure that this
makes Fujitsu POL’s agent. The contract provides for a couple of ways in which POL can access transaction data held by
Fujitsu, I'm told. First, POL has direct access to the last 90 days’ data via the “Credence” system (also provided by
Fujitsu). In addition, POL pays a fixed fee per year to access older data, up to a fixed volume. Requests for this data are
referred to as “BAU requests” and the data might be used to resolve issues raised by spmr's or in court action. However,
David believes that the swathes of data being discussed in respect of these cases would take us well over that “BAU”
volume threshold. He said that if we wanted Fujitsu to provide all that data (or just to suspend routine destruction) Fujitsu
would have to set up additional server space, and we would need to go through the change request process under the
contract, which would involve negotiating a price for that project. I'm not sure whether all this amounts to the data being
under POL’s control. Could you give some further thought to this?

If you conclude that the data is under POL’s control, we should set up a call with David X Gray and Dave Hulbert in POL
IT, plus someone from Fujitsu, to discuss the parameters for the project so that we can get an idea of the cost. Then I
agree we would follow the step outlined at point 3.

In any event I agree that we should consider whether we would need this data to support our own case and if so whether
the benefit is worth the cost. Please do discuss this with Counsel.

In relation to Iron Mountain, as I understand it we have already retrieved everything that was held there relating to the 5
live cases. Do you think we need to expand this to stop destruction of documents relating to all branches? This seems
disproportionate to me.

Kind regards

Dear Emily

As you know, POL has a duty to preserve all documents it (or its agent -
i.e. Fujitsu) holds at the time litigation becomes a possibility, unless
an agreement to the contrary can be reached with the other side. This

POL-0095153
POLO0095570
POL00095570

means that routine document destruction policies have to be suspended or
all data retrieved prior to destruction (regardless of the cost, which
would be POL's to bear, as they are POL's documents), unless the other
side agree that it is unnecessary/disproportionate. Obviously, POL do not
want to have to face these costs, which I understand are significant.

This being the case, I think we should take the following steps:

1. Ascertain from Fujitsu:

Why documents have to be destroyed after 7 years

Why that policy cannot be suspended

How much it would cost to suspend it if it were possible

Why the cost of extracting data prior to destruction is so high

2. Find out whether there might be anything in data over 7 years' old
which POL might need to prove its case. I think this is unlikely but I
think we need to speak to counsel about this. Assuming that there is not,
then:

*
*
*
*

3. Write to Shoosmiths, explaining the answers to the questions at 1.
above - including setting out the predicted costs of suspending the data
destruction policy and of retrieving data prior to destruction - and
advising that, in POL's view it would be disproportionate to either
suspend the policy or retrieve data prior to destruction. We should also
say that, if they do not agree, then they should set out their reasons
why, including why they anticipate that this data will assist their
clients' cases - and that, if they force POL to take disproportionate and
expensive steps to preserve data, then POL will look to recover those
costs from them.

4. If counsel is of the view that POL may need some of this data to prove
its case, then either the data destruction policy will need to suspended
or all data retrieved prior to deletion (whichever is the cheaper (I
suspect data retrieval), as POL will have to bear these costs).

Having given this more thought, it is important that documents held at
Iron Mountain are also preserved even where they are over 7 years' old.
There may be no cost to suspending Iron Mountain's document destruction
policy so we would not be able to use this argument with Shoosmiths, but
we can try and argue that it would be disproportionate and unnecessary to
suspend this policy. Again, we will need to check with Richard Morgan
whether any of these documents might be needed to prove POL's case (again,

POL-0095153
POLO0095570
POL00095570

I think this is unlikely, but we should check).

Finally, can I assume that you will take forward internally the
"commercial cover" for data retrieved by Fujitsu to date, pending the
conclusion of the above process? If this has not been concluded by
Christmas - and that is unlikely, to my mind - then Fujitsu will need to
go ahead and retrieve the January 2005 transaction data Gareth mentions.

I look forward to your thoughts on the above.

Kind regards

Helen

Helen,
Sorry for the delay.

I can confirm that it is not possible to suspend the routine destruction
of data.

We have been asked about preserving data for 4 branches as follows:
Alderley Edge August 2008 to February 2009

Astwood Bank August 2004 to November 2008

Hockley May 2005 to November 2007

Splott Road July 2002 to October 2004

Because of the risk of losing the 2004 transaction records we have
retrieved the following in advance of a firm commitment from POL:

Astwood Bank 26October to 31 December 2004
Splott Road 26 October to 31 December 2004

It is our intention to retrieve January 2005 transaction requirements
prior to the Christmas break.

POL-0095153
POLO0095570
POL00095570

However we have not yet received commercial cover for these activities
from Post Office Ltd and this is outside our standard service. We are
expecting Post Office Ltd to sort out these commercial issues and will
then make that data available to them. We can continue retrieving data for
such branches as required once we get the commercials in place.

On the phone you also mentioned a 5th Branch (Merthyr Tydfil). We have had
no requests associated with that branch and so are not aware of any
specific times and in particular if any data needs to be preserved related
to the 7 year period.

Hopefully that covers everything you needed.

Regards
Gareth

routine destruction of data - please can you confirm that this is the
case.
