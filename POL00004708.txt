Mark/Nigel

I've passed on the details to Mike Wilcox, who will review the information over the course of the next week or so in line with his own
operational workloads. I've asked that he report back his findings in regards to the matter and we can them make an informed
decision on any potential grounds for an investigation case.

Nigel,

Jason is currently having one of his team review this to consider what steps can be taken. One of us will therefore be in touch very
shortly.

Nigel, this unfortunately is not so straight forward.

I understand Jason asked you a number of questions in an email 21 June and stated that with the information to hand at that time
that they could not engage from an investigation perspective. As a result of that email, I suspect this is why the ARQ was requested
by the live service desk and the information was provided to enable further checks.

In light that the information still doesn’t answer the questions posed, I have asked Jason and lain to consider how this is taken
forward, i.e. we raise a case or not, and shall return a response as soon as I can.

lain, sorry I run out of time to ring you and I’m off on Monday.
I think in a nut shell, I think we need to decide if one of the investigators who have the knowledge to sit and sift through what has
been provided along with the ARQ and go and see what the ex-spmr is holding. I think this is going to be a very onerous task, but !

can't see how we can let this one go considering she is questioning the integrity of Horizon.

How do you want me to deal with this one? Jason did offer some advice, but I think it has grown to be a more serious problem now
with what has subsequently come to light, i.e. auditor corroborating the spmr's account.

Andy / lain
This is quickly turning into a bit of a problem.

This is a potential fraud where losses occurred when a spmr moved into a portacabin, but ceased the moment she was suspended
and somebody else run the office. She did have a clerk, so it could transpire she has nothing to do with the losses. We are talking
about £28k, a potential flag case, with MP’s involved. The spmr is questioning the integrity of Horizon.

It looks like contracts/Chesterfield dealt with this themselves, although did speak to investigations. Once I received the paper work
from Nigel, it looks like there are numerous activities that have taken place, including somebody sending in an auditor who sat with
the spmr for half a day which clearly made matters worse.

I don’t know why we were never approached to deal with this as a criminal investigation in the first instance, perhaps it was felt that
it wasn't at the time. The auditor supposedly witness all transactions for half a day and witness Horizon being short, thereby
corroborating her account and also now a potential witness for her (when in fact clearly he can not have witnessed everything), and
also begs the question as to why it was left ‘high and dry’ at the time and Credence was not checked etc.

This now leaves us in a very difficult situation. With the spmr writing letters to Dave Smith, her MP and no doubt countless other
people, this is high profile. She has also joined the spmr’s fight to question the integrity of Horizon. As it stands no investigation
has taken place by us, various intervention has probably complicated this, yet because it is a question of Horizon integrity we can't
simply ignore it, or drop it, but probably have some difficult questions ahead of us in terms of why has it taken so long for us to
consider this criminal if this is the course of action we take.

What we're trying to determine here is whether there is any discrepancy between the information sent in to the Live Service team by

the spmr, Mrs Stubbs, and what the Horizon system is showing. She is alleging that her losses of £28k+ are due to problems with
the Horizon system after it was relocated into a portacabin last October whilst the branch was being renovated.

POL-0153977 E2/104/2
POL00004708
POL00004708

Can you advise whether a case is being raised on this? Given the fact that we have not experienced similar losses with the
temporary spmr who was appointed after Mrs Stubbs was suspended and the same Horizon kit is being used, shouldn't we be
asking her some very searching questions under caution?

An added complication here is that Mrs Stubbs resigned in May before being suspended in June and her notice has therefore now
expired. An applicant has been interviewed and offered the appointment but we are concerned at allowing a transfer to go ahead
whilst this debt remains outstanding. I

Please advise how this is now to be taken forward.

Nigel, no probs with requesting data from Fujitsu, but it will take around 3 weeks. Has Jason agreed to take this case on,
because we don't hand over Horizon logs to a spmr. It needs an expert to understand what it says, and usually this requires

one of the investigators.

I'll give Jason a call in the morning, then I will raise an ARQ from Fujitsu

Is this for our benefit, as there is a cost attached to ARQ requests, we do get a supply free of charge as part of the contract
but we usually don't have enough, therefore we usually charge the defence lawyers.

I have changed it slightly.

In terms of the points raised we do have a report from the auditor but it is probably not detailed enough to cover all the
points, so we will probably need to go back on this as part of the contractual case. In terms of the audit trail via Horizon
we are waiting for Mark Dinsdale to authorise the case as he holds the budget.

Nigel has today referred the case to Jason Collins requesting their involvement given the level of losses - I will forward e-
mail separately. Need to see where this gets us before we can move the case forward or start to answer her detailed
questions.

Hi Lin

Following our conversation I have prepared the attached draft. See what you think, make any changes and then I will send it
out in my name.

Moving forward, can you confirm what your next steps are re the points she has raised. I know you are waiting for the audit
trail of the transaction events. Re the comment about the two auditor visits monitoring her work and apparently also
having a problem with the figures, are you obtaining a report from the auditor? If this escalates we will need to answer the
apparent discrepancies in the figures on his laptop & Horizon.

Finally, when your investigations into the issues she has raised have been completed, will one of your team be writing to Mrs
Stubbs or do you want to channel through me? If it comes from your team, can they make reference to the letter to David
& that this is the result of investigations into the issues she raised with him. Please advise.
