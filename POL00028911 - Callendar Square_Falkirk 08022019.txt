                            Callendar Square / Falkirk
Date:   08/02/2019 10:12:00


1.      Management Summary

        In Jason Coyne's Supplementary Report dated 1St February 2019, he identifies in Table
        1 (after Para 3.21 on Page 12) a number of groups of bugs he has identified within
        Horizon.
        Fujitsu has been asked to provide an analysis on the way in which these were handled.
        This document describes what he refers to as "Callendar Square / Falkirk bug" which
        he comments on in para 3.34 to 3.42.

                                                         to it or those generated on that counter.
                                                         This was not always immediately obvious to the
                                                         user of the counter. This could result in them
                                                         thinking that some transactions which had been
                                                         entered, were missing, and so they attempted to
                                                         re-enter the transactions on another counter.

                                                         this could cause errors in the accounts.

3.   Further Info

     This looks like quite a long saga and until now I hadn't realised the full scope of it
     I was previously aware of the "Callendar Square" problem when it came up as part of
     the Misra case in 2010. At that time I produced a summary which has been quoted by
     Charles McLachlan in his WS. This was based on conversations with Anne Chambers
     (SSC) about the issue and looking at Peak PCO126376 (which was discussed in court).
     As far as the Misra case is concerned it was irrelevant for 3 reasons:
         •   It was due to issue with transfers between SUs. There was only a single SU in
             West Byfleet (so there were no Transfers)
                                                                                                   POL00028911
                                                                                                 POL00028911




   •   It was fixed in 2006 and the Misra data related to 2007 to 2008
   •   A check was made in the event logs from West Byfleet, and there was no flood
       of events (a symptom of the underlying Riposte issue)
However on re-reading Peak PC0126376, I can see it refers to 2 KELs (which I
presumably didn't look at back in 2010), which were raised much earlier. This shows
that the Riposte issue had been initially identified back in 2000. This is made clear in
KEL JBallantyne5245K and the associated Peak PC0056922. This shows that there is
a problem in Riposte such that if it loses a Thread which holds a critical lock, then
Riposte grinds to a halt and the counter becomes unusable. The avoidance action is to
restart the counter. The symptoms of the problem are a large number of events. The
Peak advises that if the issue occurs more than once per month, then we would need to
try and reproduce the issue. The KEL also refers to PC0083101.
   Past experience shows that Escher wouldn't consider bugs if they are not reproducible.

The Peak was then closed and the KEL JBallantyne5245K produced. In particular the
KEL advises SMC (who monitor events from counters), that if such events are seen to
phone the branch and advise them to re-start the affected counter, and if they are
balancing to abandon the balance until the reboot has happened as this prevents
replication working correctly.
Meanwhile KEL JSimpkins338Q was raised in May 2002 and seems very similar, but
does have a clearer description of the root cause namely the Riposte error "Timeout
occurred waiting for lock (0xC1090003)" in an event.
   JBallantyne5245K does refer to JSimpkins338Q, but it isn't clear why both KELs were
   needed. They are now both in the Deleted KELs collection as they refer to errors in Riposte
   which has not been used since 2010.

This KEL was not triggered by any referenced Peak, but it does identify Peak
PCO086212 which was sent to development in January 2003. This in turn identifies
Peak PCO075892 which I suspect is what triggered the KEL - it was raised on
2/5/2002 and the KEL was raised on 10/5/2002 which was when the Peak was closed
(by me) with insufficient evidence. It also refers to Peak PCO103864.
KEL CObeng2025L was also raised, and refers to KEL JSimpkins338Q. Again I can't
see the need for this 3rd KEL related to the issue.
Looking at the issue now and at the associated Peaks and the 2 KELs, there seem to
have been quite frequent issues of "Timeout waiting for locks", and the approach taken
was for SMC to monitor these events and advice the SMPR to reboot should these
events occur, and nothing was done to actually get to the bottom of the issue. Escher
seem to have fixed the problem in 2006, although there is a Peak (PC0193012 -
referenced by JSimpkins338Q) which was raised in 2010 sometime after the Escher fix
and again a reboot fixed the issue.
Responses to points raised in Mr Coyne's report:
   1. 3:34: He says: "This leads to a discrepancy in the branch accounts since the
      double entry principle of accounting is not applied."
       This isn't strictly true. Double Entry Bookkeeping was always applied.
       However in the case of a Transfer, there are normally 2 separate double entry
       baskets:
                                                                                         POL00028911
                                                                                   POL00028911




          •     The Transfer Out from one Stock Unit
          •     The Transfer In to another Stock Unit
     There is also an indicator of all outstanding Transfers. This should be updated
     when the Transfer In occurs to prevent a further Transfer In. However this
     update to the Transfer record was not visible to other counters, thus allowing
     the Transfer I to be repeated. Balancing assumes that if there are no
     outstanding Transfers, then all Transfers out and Transfers In in a Branch
     cancel out. However if (as happened in Callendar Square) there were 2
     Transfers In for a single Transfer Out, then this affects the cash holding in the
     branch and results in a loss to the SPMR.
2. I agree with the observation in 3.36 that the underlying issue in Riposte had
   been present since at least 2000. Avoidance action had been identified in the
   KELs, but clearly had not been effective in Callendar Square.
3. We do have a spreadsheet obtained from SSC which does identify affected
   branches (ripostelockprobs.xlsx, below). I don't think this has been declared.

4. In 3.40 Mr Coyne comments on inconsistencies in the peak Closure reasons. I
   think this is covered by Steve Parker's statement, in that they are the best view
   of the person concerned and not necessarily fully consistent.
     In 3.41 there is a discussion about whether or not the peak was routed to
     Escher for a fix. In general, Escher would not accept any defect unless it could
     be reproduced, and this was one we couldn't reliably reproduce. It is clear
     from the response in Peak PCO126376 that at some point the issue had been
     reported to Escher (presumably via some other Peak, not directly linked to this
     investigation) and that they had identified the issue and provided a fix in the
     version of Riposte we were due to issue in 2006 as part of S90.
6. I can't really dispute the comments in 3.42.
