Age if under 18 over 18 (If over 18 insert ‘over 18')

This statement (consisting of 2 pages each signed by me) is true to the best of my knowledge
and belief and I make it knowing that, if it is tendered in evidence, I shall be liable to
prosecution if I have wilfully stated in it anything which I know to be false or do not believe true.

I have been employed by Fujitsu Services (Fujitsu), Post Office Account, since 11 March 2002
as an Information Technology (IT) Security Analyst where I am involved in IT Security for the
Post Office Account. I have a working knowledge of the computer system known as Horizon,
which is a computerised accounting system used by Post Office Ltd. I am authorised by Fujitsu
to undertake extractions of audit data held on the Horizon system and to obtain information
regarding system transaction information processed on the Horizon system.

I make this Witness Statement from facts within my own knowledge unless otherwise stated.
Any records to which I refer in my statement form part of the records relating to the business of
Fujitsu. These were compiled during the ordinary course of business from information supplied
by persons who have or may reasonably be supposed to have personal knowledge of the
matter dealt with in the information supplied, but are unlikely to have any recollection of the
information or cannot be traced, since the nature of the helpdesk involves many engineers all
at differing levels and any number could be involved in a particular call. As part of my duties, I
have access to these records, but I was not involved with any of the technical aspects of these
calls. This area is not my particular area of expertise and I make this witness statement simply
to help clarify the call logs for the benefit of the Court.

An important element of the support provided to sub-postmasters and Counter Clerks is the
Horizon System Desk (HSD). The HSD is the Horizon user’s first ‘port of call’ in the event of

Continuation of statement of

their experiencing a problem with the Horizon system or requiring advice and guidance. If the
system were to malfunction, upon discovery the Horizon users (i.e. the sub-postmaster or
counter clerk) would raise a call to the HSD seeking clarification or advice. HSD is a service
run by Fujitsu Services for the Post Office.

During the periods 13" Jan 2010 to the 17 Feb 2010, 19"" May 2010 to the 14™ July 2010,
13" Oct 2010 to the 17" Nov 2010 and 5" Dec 2010 to the 30" Mar 2011 there were 4 calls
for advice and guidance logged by HSD for the Rowlands Castle Post Office®, Branch Code
— 107937.

It is my opinion that none of these calls relate to faults which would have had an effect on the
integrity of the information held on the system as none of the calls recorded raised problems

that fall outside the normal operating parameters of the Horizon system.

I have been asked to provide details and information on the calls for advice and guidance
logged by HSD recorded during the period periods 13" Jan 2010 to the 17" Feb 2010, 19"
May 2010 to the 14" July 2010, 13" Oct 2010 to the 17" Nov 2010, 5"" Dec 2010 to the 4”
Feb 2011 and 5" Feb 2011 to the 30" Mar 2011 for the Rowlands Castle Post Office®,
Branch Code — 107937.

To obtain this information I ran an Incident search facility for the archived TFS call data using
the dates requested. For ease of use and understanding I then cut and pasted all the relevent

generated data in to a word document outlining all calls.

I produce the resultant document as Exhibit APDO1.
