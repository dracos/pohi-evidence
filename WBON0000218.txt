Andy,

Michael, Emma and I have been working on drafts for each of the 7 additional bug summaries referenced by the
experts in JS2. All but 1 of the summaries is ready in draft and attached FYI. The final Bug 25 — Lyca top up should
be ready Monday. We have also prepared the summary table below which also sets out the status and next steps in
terms of finalising the bugs. Once all 7 summaries have been finalised shall add these to your spreadsheet
summarising the position on each report?

Thanks
Katie
