2. Introduction

This programme has emerged from the E2E Simplification feasibility study which has addressed the core processes of Post Office Ltd ~ Sales,
Accounting, Cash Management and Stock Management plus the support processes of Reference Data and Management Information.

The major recommendation of that study is the need to take complexity out of the business both in process and systems terms making it simpler to
work both at the branches and in central functions plus offering a reduction in IT systems costs through the simpler use of technology.

The primary reasons for implementing this programme are to:

Improve efficiency and eliminate duplicate processes and systems in the accounting and reference data areas specifically.

Implement a simpler accounting model which supports the speed of change and product deployment and makes the job simpler
and more flexible in branches.

 — Account via a single authoritative transaction data source and thus create an effective debt management process decreasing debt
write offs.

Account separately for client and business funds to give a clear view of the actual assets and liabilities of each.

« Decrease operational cost

The programme has identified the following high level benefits

There are benefits of £7.0m per annum from 2004/05 (full year 2005/06) arising from the closure of Optip (€4.8m), CBDB (£1.2m), Reference Data
(£0.7m) and Small Systems (£0.3m).

There are benefits to be obtained from Fujitsu Services through the new Horizon contract of £2.8m from 2004/05 as a result of simpler accounting
and reference data processes. Fujitsu have stated that they can reduce their resources if Post Office Ltd simplifies its processes. £2.8m
represents an element of that reduction. These are over and above the current business plan.

Additionally, there is an opportunity to gain business benefits in the region of £4.4m through:
‘© Improving understanding of the cash cycle which will reduce interest payments
Implementation of a new accounting model
‘© Creation of an effective debt management process so reducing bad debts
‘Utilising a single authoritative transaction data source
Improved reference data processes

There are other potential benefits which:

«Improve the understanding of the cash cycle to:
Decrease holdings in cash centres by £15m

Decrease the cash cushion at branches by £20m

« Increase the visibility of other cash items by £10m

‘* Provide a robust statement of cash to the DTI which consequently reduces borrowing costs
Increase the capability to implement organisational change

The programme is primarily aimed at putting in new systems and processes to replace old systems and manual processes with the replacement of
four major systems: OpTIP, CBDB, Reference Data, NNDB and a collection of small systems

The current timetable and migration approach suggest a three phased approach to delivering the programme, with gradual build up of the ledgers,
with a target completion date of March 2005, The following are the key implementation milestone within the business case:

« — Release 1 - April 2004

e — Release 2- October 2004

23. Document Explanations

231. Creation Process

Details of the Business Proposition and Requirements have been provided by the Post Office™ Business Sponsor and representatives and
the Business Architecture Representatives.

The specific domains and owners are as follows:

Accounting and Cash Management - Stephen Hirst
« — Transaction Processing - Vicky Noble

Network Operations - Ruth Holleran

e — Cash and Logistics Supplies - Bob Lammin

The High Level End-to-End Solution Architecture and Architecture principles should be provided by the Post Office™ Technical Architect,
who should also provide the Technical Requirements and state the required Supplier Deliverables.

Once supplier domains have been identified assistance may be required from a number of suppliers with the above.

232. Business Process Models

Post Office's functional requirements are represented in the form of Process models using Business objects together with Process objects
and supporting descriptions and information flow definitions. The common tool used for creating these Process Models is Popkin Systems
Architect. An example of the high level process map is shown below.

Accounts and Settlement [IDEF0]

This depicts process boxes and information flows. Where appropriate each process box is then decomposed to a lower level process.
Systems Architect will also capture and manage the inter-dependencies between processes and ultimately the data attributes required to
create systems interfaces thus creating an overall IS architecture.

Boxes depicted in rd are part of the overall process but deemed out of scope for this particular part of the design.

Boxes depicted in black are processes which needed to be shown because of their relationship but are delivered elsewhere eg. Royal Mail
Group

These requirements together with the non-functional requirements are also represented as individual statements to enable compliance and
acceptance processes to verify that the delivered solution meets the Post Office requirements. Each requirement is individually numbered
using the following syntax: -

27?-xxx - where 727 is a fixed label corresponding to the project and xxx is the requirement number, starting at 001

3. Programme Gverview — Release 1
a1 Business Proposition

The business proposition for Release 1 covers Cash and Funds Management, Reference Data and Management Information. The scope,
Priorities and business drivers for each of these are specified below.

32. Cash and Funds Management

321. Scone

Management of physical cash within branches and cash centres including:
© Inventory Management
© — Replenishment Planning
® — Overnight Cash Holdings (ONCH) Control

© Distribution of Cash
Management of the overall liquidity of the business including:

© Cashflow
© — Borrrowings

322 Koy Prierities

2 fundamental changes have made Post Office Limited's funding position a critical business survival issue
© The business is trading at a loss

@ The migration of benefits to ACT will be accompanied by the loss of pre-funding by government departments of the
necessary cash in the network
The business now has to borrow funds to fund its trading losses and to fund working capital needed in branches. Such borrowing is limited
in availability and its costs add to the trading loss. From April 2003 DTI will provide a loan and will require a robust statement of cash
holding as security.

323. Business Drivers/Issues

There is a requirement to:
© — Drive down cash holdings and therefore reduce the DT! borrowing requirement, which in turn will reduce the level of interest

paid.

Bring together all the elements of cashflow and provide cohesive management to deliver cashflow targets.

Improve management information, linked to financial statements, to support the management of cash (funds)

To improve the financial controls for cash remittances, where there are losses of £5m per year

To account separately for client and business funds to give a clear view of the actual assets and liabilities of each.

To clearly show the overall indebtedness of clients.

To be able to accurately identify physical cash at outlet rather than overall cash which can include cash equivalents such as
cheques.

To be able to forecast and manage cashflow within the DTI target (£330m for 2002/03)
To have a single, comprehensive view of cash (funds) in one place
© — To improve the integration of cash centre holdings into cashflow management

33. Reference Data
3.3.1. Scope

© The current reference data processes and systems within POL are complex, inflexible and inconsistent, therefore the quality
of reference data is mistrusted.

© — There are several systems within POL which master items of reference data and there are several more systems which key
in their own reference data which exists in master systems.

© The process of making reference data changes is complex and lengthy leading to allegations thal the business cannot get
its products to market quickly enough. This is compounded by a boundary between POL and Fujitsu Services with various
systems and process interfaces between the boundaries.

© The scope of this work includes the simplification of the processes operating at the boundary between POL and Fujitsu
332. Key Priorities

© — Toensure consistency in reference data usage within Post Office and Fujitsu
© — Tosimplify the current processes
© — Toallow changes, such as organisational changes, to be implemented in a more timely fashion

333. Business Drivers/Issues

Support data driven change within the business where there is economic advantage to The Post Office
Reduction in operation costs

Removal of inconsistent reference data being used within the organisation

Allow for new processes which effect a vastly improved speed to market

Lack of a fully automated end to end process to capture reference data changes leads to delays and errors.
Locally held reference data will need to be removed and made available from a central source.

a4. Management Information
3A1 Scope

There is a four tiered scope:

Replace current legacy MI systems - notably LID, STAM and Intellect - by building on the current data warehouse
functionality and thus reduce operating costs to the business

© Provide a facility to enable basket analysis enquiry for Sales and Marketing
© Provide the capability to access management information through a single viewpoint
© — Restructure and improve the current design

Currently the Sales MI deliverable has produced a first cut data warehouse with sales transactions from Horizon and reference data in order
to:

© Deliver sales data into the operation in order to drive up sales
© — Delivering sales data to Sales & Marketing for marketing purposes

342. Koy Prierities

Replacement of current management information systems which add to complexity
Having systems which enable the quick production of MI to flexible organisation structures
Generating a commercial based culture in the retail line via profit and loss

Timeliness of information

343. Business Drivers/issues

© Sales Ml has been delivered but its primary focus of gaining a quick view of what is happening has been obscured by
demands to use the data for other things e.g. Settlement. The business has stated that this should not be the case,
although the data can be used for providing interim figures

© — There is lack of clarity between MI and operational reporting

© There is a need to be able to reflect current and ever changing organisational structures in the delivery of MI. Current
systems cannot do this and are based around old organisational structures which means the data produced is of little value.

© — Historical data needs to move with changes in the organisation so that it accompanies those changes. Currently this is not
possible.

The current granularity of the data used within Sales MI (Item/Branch/Day) is not deemed to be sufficient for future needs
Potential gaps exist e.g. Data from other channels like internet transactions

Business ownership of the data warehouse and the organisational structure required for Ml

Need to report out to the operation

Use of staff hours as an efficiency measure

Use of Mystery Shopper and report out results

Need to have more robust costing data and break down overheads into their constituent components.

Discrepencies in cash pouch

Description: This process provides a constraint between the physical delivery of cash, by the carrier, and the updating of the information in
the various accounting systems of the liability for the cash. It is designed to remove the possibility that system updates may not transfer
liabilities for sums of cash when the cash has physically transferred location but not recorded as received by the postmaster. This, therefore,
supports the production of a more robust statement of cash holding.

On arrival of the carrier the agent would enter a part of the counter system which will demand some token data (barcode on pouch). The
system would then verify the delivery, and obtain remittance data from the consignment note sent by cash handling. Once verified, the
system will produce the paperwork (receipt) and update the cash figure within the stock unit.

As a result of running this process; the branch accounts will be updated with the liability of the value of the cash in the pouch (the branch
accounts will then provide the onward updates of the overall POL accounts) and the delivery confirmation information should be prepared
and transmitted to the Cash Centre accounts system, via LFS.
Triggers: The agent choosing the function within the Horizon counter system, on arrival of the carrier, triggers the process
Frequency of operation: On average the cash is delivered to a branch twice a week
Volumes: The process is operated once per cash delivery, per pouch.
Automation: Once the process has been selected from the counter system the process should operate with minimal intervention from the
agent, who should only be required to enter the token data, ideally by bar code scan or some other token reading function. Requirements
for instigating the counter transaction by the token read are to be investigated as part of the detailed requirements analysis.
Locations: To be performed at all branches where the Horizon counter system is available
Input requirements at the WP boundary: Apart from the trigger to instigate the process the only information flowed in to this process is;
the consignment note, containing a specified value of cash.
Output requirements at the WP boundary: The process outputs the following information;
= Pouch delivery confirmation —a piece of information flowing to the cash management system to inform its accounts that this
cash has now transferred liability.
= Discrepancies in cash — a piece of information flowing to the Physical Cash Management system to inform its accounts that
there is/was a discrepancy noted within the cash delivery.
= Receipt — a physical receipt printed part of which is signed by the carrier and the agent, part of which is taken with the pouch
by the courier.
= Remittance Slip - A physical printed slip which contains details of the value that has been remitted into the stock unit, for
checking purposes.
Time Constraints: None

Fall back procedures: In case the counter system is unavailable when the courier arrives or the pouch token data is unreadable (bar code
doesn't scan) it should be possible for the agent to manually enter the pouch token code. Each occurrence of this happening should be
recorded for management information. In case the consignment note has not been delivered to the branch, the pouch should contain a
physical advice note, upon which is a token who's data contains the value to be remitted into the stock unit. Each occurrence of this
happening should be recorded for management information and subsequent investigation.

6.5.1.2 Barcode Scan Carrier

Description: This process provides a constraint between the physical collection of cash, by the courier, and the updating of the information
in the various accounting systems of the liability for the cash. It is designed to remove the possibility that system updates may transfer
liabilities for sums of cash when the cash has not physically transferred location, as may happen when an agent REMs out a pouch of cash
some time(days) before the arrival of the courier in preparation for despatching the cash. This, therefore, supports the production of a more
robust statement of cash holding.
On arrival of the courier the agent should be able to enter a part of the counter system which will demand some token data (anticipated to
be a token held by the carrier such as an authorised collectors card) which will uniquely identify the courier and/or verify that the courier is
present (it is anticipated that the code will be of a verifiable value. requirements for managing/changing the valid set of courier codes are to
be investigated as part of the detailed requirements analysis). Only on validation of this token data will the counter system proceed to
produce the paperwork (receipt) to allow the despatch of the pouch of cash.
As a result of running this process; the branch accounts will be updated with the reduced liability of the value of the cash in the pouch (the
branch accounts will then provide the onward updates of the overall POL accounts) and the Branch Consignment Note information should
be prepared and transmitted to the Cash Centre accounts system.
Triggers: The agent choosing the function within the Horizon counter system, on arrival of the courier, triggers the process
Frequency of operation: On average the cash is despatched from the branch to the cash centre once every 2 weeks. However cash
positive branches (where cash receipts > cash pay outs), of which there are around 150, can despatch cash as frequently as twice per
week.
Volumes: The process is operated once per cash despatch.
Automation: Once the process has been selected from the counter system the process should operate with minimal intervention from the
agent, who should only be required to enter the token data, ideally by bar code scan or some other token reading function. Requirements
for instigating the counter transaction by the token read are to be investigated as part of the detailed requirements analysis.
Locations: To be performed at all branches where the Horizon counter system is available
Input requirements at the WP boundary: Apart from the trigger to instigate the process the only information flowed in to this process is;
the information that a pouch, containing a specified value of cash, has been made up in preparation of being despatched and the courier
token data value.
Output requirements at the WP boundary: The process outputs the following information;
= — Cash Despatches -Value of cash despatched to update the branch accounts, from where the overall POL accounts will be
updated
= Branch Consignment Note — a piece of information flowing to the Physical Cash Management system to inform its accounts
that this cash has now transferred liability to it, This should also carry the courier token data for subsequent verification and
analysis.
= Receipt — a physical receipt printed part of which is signed by the courier and retained by the agent, part of which is taken
with the pouch by the courier.
Time Constraints: None
Fall back procedures: In case the counter system is unavailable when the courier arrives or the courier token data is unreadable (bar code
doesn't scan) it should be possible for the agent to manually enter the courier token code, Each occurrence of this happening should be
recorded for management information. In case the courier does not have the token data or the token data available is deemed invalid an
emergency option (to be used only in these (rare) circumstance) should be made available which would allow the agent to despatch the
pouch to the courier without the token data. Each occurrence of this happening should be recorded for management information and
subsequent investigation.

Description: This process provides the accounting system with a ‘derived’ cash figure for each branch within the post office estate. It is
designed to ensure that a more robust cash figure is available each day for both the accounts and SAPADS. The system will gather the data
from all stock units within the branch, and output these figures as a total branch figure.

As a result of running this process SAPADS will receive the derived figure along with the currently declared ONCH figures, and should
enable them to more accurately plan cash deliveries to the branches.
Triggers: Scheduled automated run.
Frequency of operation: It is anticipated that this process will be run once, at the end of every business day.
Volumes: 1 file per branch, per run
Automation: This process would be fully automated, and would run at the end of each day, as part of the end of day process.
Locations: To be performed at all branches where the Horizon system is available
Input requirements at the WP boundary: Branch cash opening figures and usage figures will be required for this process to function
Output requirements at the WP boundary: The process outputs the following information;

= Aderived cash figure for each branch for use in POL financials. (may be a cash movement figure, as oppose to a total

figure)

= Aderived cash figure for each branch, for use within cash planning.

= Adeclared cash figure for each branch which have made complete declarations.
Time Constraints: Must be within POL financials and SAPADS at the start of business the next day.
Fall back procedures: Should there be a communications failure with a branch, the figure derived the previous day should be used. If the
derived figure fails, and there is no communications failure, the same should apply for the accounts, however, if a branch has completed the
daily ONCH figures, SAPADS could use this figure for its cash planning activity.

6.5.14 Summarize Transaction Data

Description: This end of day process summarises all the transactions performed at the branch throughout the business day, and would
then output the Ledger Entry Information. The ledger entry information will be defined as part of the detailed requirements analysis. This is
teally an enhancement of the current process, which summarises the transactions from the branch, and compares the data to that of the
previous day, for reconciliation purposes.
Triggers: Scheduled automated run.
Frequency of operation: It is anticipated that this will run once per business day
Volumes: 1 summary per branch
Automation: This process would be fully automated, and would run at the end of each business day, as part of the end of day process.
Locations: To be performed at all branches where the Horizon system is available.
Input requirements at the WP boundary: The information that flows into this process are;
= Cash centre transaction data
‘Stock holding information
Pouch delivery confirmation

= cheque and voucher values
Output requirements at the WP boundary: The process outputs the following information;
= Ledger entry information.
Time Constraints: None
Fall back procedures: Should the end of day process not run at a branch due to the terminal being switched off, the process would not run
until the next end of day process. the information would then be retrospectively fitted to the correct accounting days reports. Details of the
non-polling outlets are held within Fujitsu's domain, and may be used for information.

Bank Statement processing

The initial assumption is that POL only used one bank account , however after the initial requirements gathering exercise it has been
established that POL uses at least 5 different accounts . The Banks so far identified are the Bank of England and the Co-Operative Bank

Business processes for each of these accounts are completely different in the way they are processed, in most cases for legitimate
business processes, even if the use of the account itself has transactions of a similar nature e.g. Client settlement.

Within this process the transactions on the Bank Statements are reconciled to the ledger entries in the Bank accounts and any further
entries required are journalled manually into the ledgers as required.

Cheques are logged as a method of payment during the counter session. The cheques are counted and the value noted and these are
‘Remmed Out’ to the Centre on an agreed periodicity. When the cheques are ‘Remmed Out’ a message is sent via the Horizon system and
the Transaction Management System (TMS), which results in a posting to the financial system (SAP). The summarisation for cheques sent
to the centre is recognised as a special transaction and will be treated as such when creating the follow on postings to SAP.

The main steps of the proposed process are
14. The cheques are remmed out of the branch to the centre
2. The cheques are sent to EDS who clear the cheques on behalf of POL
3. _ EDS inform POL of the cheques — quantities and values which have been presented to the bank
4. The bank statement is received with the cleared cheques.

Further detailed analysis is required , to tie up the entire process from Counter to EDS and SAP Financials.

Debit Cards are used in certain Branches to pay for transactions i.e. DVLA. This is captured into Horizon at the Counter and submitted to
POL Financials via the TMS interface.

The current point of discussion is the treatment of this transaction. Currently itis being treated as cash, when in fact the monies are not
physically transferred into POL's account unti the next business day.

The requirement is to show the Streamline amount in process in the ledger until the amount is cleared by Streamline in the form of a
payment into POL’s bank account the following day. The processing of the bank statement will be offset against the unpaid Streamline
transactions. This will enable POL to have a constant and daily view of the outstanding funds from Streamline and provide forecasts to
Cash Planning based on actual data.

Development of Horizon Transaction Management systems is required.

Further detailed analysis is required, to ensure business is in agreement with proposed process including the reconciliation between
Streamline and the Banks, Streamline ( Emus File ) and the Fujitsu Systems of “DRS and EPOS” , error management process arising out
of differences in this E2E process as well as the clearing of Streamline debt within POL FS arising out of Bank Statement processing.

Potential sources of errors are:
1. Fujitsu Domain
2. Streamline
3. PO Counters

6.5.17 Process - Produce Borrowings and Investments Ledger

The process diagrams below show where this process is within the process model:

Flow Chart - Diagram A487

Description
This process is required in order to input the necessary information to produce the Borrowings and Investments Ledger from the POL
financials.

The Treasury function is managed by Royal Mail Group currently but would eventually be moved to POL. The requirements reflect the
move of the Investment and Loan reporting into POL FS but not the management of the Treasury function.

The following accounts are required in the POL FS COA to enable journal entries to be made on a daily basis to reflect the Investments and
Loans in POL. These need to be a visible split by Business and Client funds.

The business balances are not funded by the DTI — this is why there needs to be visibility between the 2.
There is no automatic feed from group to POL.
The accounts required are as follows:

Deposits

- DTI Loan Surplus

- Money Market Fund

- National Loan Fund

- Debt Management Office
- Local Authority Deposits
- Gilts

Loans

- DTI Loan

-  Client/Business (Intra business funds movements - TBC)
- Bank Loans

- Royal Mail Surplus

There may be more P&L accounts required to reflect the change in information logged in POL FS — further analysis required at the detailed
analysis phase for Rel 4

The interest calculation within POL FS is not required at the moment.

Triggers: Information received from Group Treasury.

Frequency of operation: Daily.

Volumes: Up to 1-10 journals per day (TBC).

Automation: Manual process.

Locations: Performed centrally at POL Finance.

Description: This process aims to capture all transactions relating to manual adjustments of the ledgers to establish the final reporting
position for POL FS. The process involves reviewing various accounts periodically and doing the necessary investigations to make the
journal adjustments where required. The periodicity varies with the type of account under review.

This process also covers the running of automatic matching processes before the review of certain accounts e.g. Cash in Transit.

Visibility of Cash in Transit by Pouch/Coin Bag is required within POL FS. The matching of receipts from Cash Centres with despatches
from Branches and vice versa is required. The automatic matching of these transactions should be available in the ledger such that the
ledgers can be used to investigate potential theft/fraud.

Cash reporting

The balances of Cash by branch/cash centre should be available in order to investigate where there may be an opportunity to reduce the
amount of cash at the branches.

Triggers: Periodic review of POL Ledgers to ensure that the accounts reflect a true view of the current status.

65.2.2 Flow-Ledger Entry information

Description: This flow carries information of the transactions processed and summarised through TMS into the POL FS. For release 1 the
transactions required to be processed are as follows:

» Cash transactions sourced from the Branches via Horizon (including corrections to cash due to discrepancies flowing from
Branches via TMS). The information required in this flow includes:

0 Cash at branch summarised from the end of day cumulative transactions

© Cheques at branch showed on a separate line

o Cheques sent out of the branch to the centre to enable the transaction in the ledgers to transfer the balance to EDS.
processing account or into an interim account dependent on what information is available throughout the cheque
handling process

© Commemorative coins are treated as stock when reported from Hemel or Branches and Cash when reported from the
Cash Centres.

» — Cash Centre Transactions:

o Movements at cash centres relating to the ‘Cash Ledger’ accounts specified in appendix A. This should be
summarised (unless the volume of data is not excessive to the extent that the ledger can accept transaction level
information - Volumes TBC BC) The data should be sourced from the end of day transactions on SAP ADS to
produce Cash Centre updated balances per relevant account in the POL FS totals. The cut off point for the end of day
has not yet been defined. NB: The split of notes and coins is not required to flow to POL FS - this will be handled in
SAP ADS.

o Cash pouch information, for remittances into cash centres, by pouch number to be transferred by transaction to POL
FS to enable matching within the ledgers

» — Cash in transit transactions sourced from the LFS messages created in Branches and in the Cash Centres (Sourced from SAP
ADS outbound interface - consignment note)

o Discrepancies to create an appropriate entry in the POL FS
> Foreign Currency information
© Foreign currency to be reported by branch in sterling
o There is a requirement to report FX in transit - fo be confirmed how this is captured. (TBC)
© Foreign currency to be reported by stock management centre (Hemel) - this is currently reported using a cash account
on a weekly basis from Hemel. This feed would need to be capture and fed to POL FS.
> ATM information
co  ATMnotes for Cashtek in Transit required to be reported separately in the ledgers
© Girobank ATM Bank Notes required to be reported separately in the ledgers
There is no requirement to report Branch ATM balances on a separate account in the ledgers

The content of the interface depends on the reporting requirement from the POL FS. Further analysis is required to confirm most of these
requirements in more detail.

Nature of interface: Automatic interface, which creates IDOCS, which post transactions/documents in the POL FS that, contributes to the
information required to produce the POL Ledgers, using a single stream of data from Horizon and other sources.

How many instances of the interface are likely to exist: If each type of flow of information is regarded as an instance there will be
several instances producing several types of IDOCS in the POL financials in order to produce the complete POL Ledgers. For release one
the number of instances of this interface are less than for release 2 when the Client, Branch and Agent Ledgers will be produced in more
detail

Frequency of use: Daily overnight. The cutoff times for end of day in the branches will determine at what point the flow is triggered from
the Branch to TMS

Data volumes: Unknown, this is to be confirmed through detailed requirements analysis.

Time Constraints: Known constraints are the volumes of data being processed. Increasing the processing power of the servers can
mitigate the time constraints, however this has a hardware cost implication. This will be confirmed through detailed requirements
analysis

Fall Back Procedures: This flow is the crux of the ledgers being produced using a single automatic stream of data via the TMS. There is
no fall back position to this flow. Resilience needs to be built into the system in order that the interface can be recovered as quickly as
possible.

Security risks:
The risks involved in this data flow are high because of the complexities involved. The fewer the variants in terms of differences in
treatment between different types of data the more easily mitigated these risks will be. There will be a certain level of matching of
summarised totals within the TMS for some of the data flows.

There is also the possibility that attempts to create transactions in SAP may fail due to a change in the source data, which has not been
carried forward into the logic of the interface. It is critical for the reference data updates to be done in a timely manner in order that these
transactions do not fail for that reason.

Further analysis of the process required before all risks are identified and a solution agreed.

65.2.3 Flow - Streamline Settlement

Description: This flow carries information of the Streamline settlements of Branch transactions to POL Financials. In release 1 this will be
fed into both CBDB and POL FS.

1. Debit Cards transactions at Branch flowing into TMS and into POL FS as a debtor through the main
Transaction Data flow (not necessarily aligned to trading day)

2. Tracking of outstanding payments through to Clearing and Matching in TMS.

3, Tracking of End to End process in SAP Financials, including the handing of reconciliation differences
identified in the TMS matching process. Reconciliation errors are currently identified in DRS (TMS in
the future) and passed to TP. TBC. Ann Clarke. NB the future process needs to include the clearing
of TMS as well as POL FS.

This flow is the external settlement data flow of information from Streamline which results in the matching of transactions in TMS (step 2)
and a resulting log of reconciliation differences produced by the TMS and processed manually into the financials (step 3).

This therefore indicates that this process and flow needs further definition before confirming the required flow of
information to the ledgers/TMS from external sources i.e. Streamline.

Nature of interface: Manual currently with information flowing simultaneously into DRS and Central Cashiers, further analysis required -
this flow may only be required to flow into the TMS process, in the future, rather than direct into the POL FS and we may not need
to change from the current flow. Additional TMS summarisation may be required to handle the discrepancies into the ledgers.

How many instances of the interface are likely to exist: Though this data must flow from Streamline and is currently in place to do the
matching for all transactions in the Banking process, the implementation of the TMS system would channel this flow to one consistent route
from Streamline for all outlet transactions. Matching against Branch transactions are carried out in DRS/TMS.

Frequency of use: Daily (working days - 5 days assumed)
Data volumes: One value daily.

Time Constraints: Information received by 3pm from Streamline. Reconciliations received by 8am the same day (before Streamline data
flows in).

Fall Back Procedures: N/A

Security risks: The matching of Streamline Debt against actual payments is something that is currently done outside the Financial System
and how we manage this in future may reduce the time taken in the matching process, however the level of detail required may mean that
at this stage the Clearing process is done on a daily basis total rather than at branch level. The process of matching in the POL FS will
need to be agreed.

Further analysis of the process required before all risks are identified and a solution agreed.

6.5.24 Flow-Cheques Processed

Description: This flow carries information of the Cheques Handled by EDS and submitted to the bank.
Key Components of the overall process:
1. Cheques are sent from branch to EDS
2. EDS submit cheques to bank and sends information to POL at this point
3. Cheques are cleared at the bank and the bank statement, showing cleared cheques is sent to POL and
processed. This can be seen as a separate flow.

This flow is expected to come in either as an Excel file or on paper and will be manually analysed and journaled into POL FS as required.

Nature of interface: Manual - the detail is not yet finalised dependent on the nature of the information coming from EDS if any. TBC
(expected to be as with current flow in Data Central - daily summary by day e.g. Day A vs Day B).

How many instances of the interface are likely to exist: We would expect this to be a single communication from EDS.
Frequency of use: Daily (5, 6 or 7 days to be confirmed - assume 5?- Marie Cockett)

Data volumes: Unknown, this to be confirmed through detailed requirements analysis.

Time Constraints: Unknown, this to be confirmed through detailed requirements analysis.

Fall Back Procedures: N/A

Security risks: The ability to track the process of cheque handling from end to end is vital and would substantially reduce the ability of
cheques dropping out of the system either due to error or fraud. The risk associated with this flow is minimal as it is information regarding

cheques being presented to the bank. It is information for tracking and matching only.

Further analysis of the process required before all risks are identified and processes established to manage risk.

6.5.2.5 Flow-Bank Statements

Description: This flow carries information of the Bank Statements to be processed in Central Cashiers department.
Key Components of the process:
« Bank Statement processing into the ledgers
The bank transaction details will flow through from the banks as is currently the case. The information will be used in analysing and
journaling transactions onto the ledgers as well as matching transactions cleared through the banks with control accounts such as cheques.
The content of the information in this flow is determined by the bank and will be used for a manual process as is the current requirement.

Nature of interface: Manual, but much more detailed requirements analysis is required to confirm the detail of this data flow e.g.
journal voucher types. NB this will need to be replicated into CBDB/ES-FS as well during the implementation of Release 2.

How many instances of the interface are likely to exist: At least five, but further detailed analysis is required

Frequency of use: Daily or weekly

Data volumes: Unknown, this to be confirmed through detailed requirements analysis.

Time Constraints: Volume of transactions against staff numbers, and timely receipt of Bank Statements

Fall Back Procedures: N/A

Security risks: This is an SAP internal process therefore the new process will not reduce any risk that exists in the current process. The

current risk is all business risk with regards to transmission of bank statements to POL on an open fax line and ensuring that there is
sufficient segregation of duties in the Finance department.

6.5.2.6 Flow- Branch Cash Holding for Cash Planning

Description
This is the Overnight Cash Balances report from Branches to Cash Centres. This information will be used for the stock planning of cash in
the cash centres.

There is a current interface in place which will need minimal change.
The interface contains:

> The optional declared position at the denominational level
» — Derived position at the total cash level (this is the additional information)

Nature of interface: Automated as per AIS BPDES023 with minor amendment. There is a separate record by denomination so the
additional information will flow as an additional record with a special flag to differentiate it

6.5.27 Flow-Cash Centre Cash Holding Information

Description: This flow carries information of the relevant transactions or summaries to POL FS via TMS from the Cash Centres.

» — Cash Centre Transactions:

o Movements at cash centres relating to the ‘Cash Ledger’ accounts specified in appendix A. This should be
summarised (unless the volume of data is not excessive to the extent that the ledger can accept transaction level
information - Volumes TBC BC). The data should be sourced from the end of day transactions on SAP ADS to
produce Cash Centre updated balances per relevant account in the POL FS totals. The cut off point for the end of day
has not yet been defined. NB: The split of notes and coins is not required to flow to POL FS — this will be handled in
SAP ADS.

‘The content ofthe interface depends on the reporting requitement from the POL FS. There is requirement to hold ‘cent information on these transactions for release 2. Mf this interface can
be addressed in release 1 for both sets of requirements this would be the preferred way forward. Further analysis is required to confirm most of these requirements in more detail

Nature of interface: Automatic interface, which creates documents in POL FS that contribute to the information required to produce the
POL Ledgers, using a single stream of data from Cash Centres

How many instances of the interface are likely to exist: This will be one interface from SAP ADS via TMS to POL FS.

Frequency of use: Daily ovemight. Time schedule TBC

Data volumes: Unknown, this is to be confirmed through detailed requirements analysis.

Time Constraints: Known constraints are the volumes of data being processed. Increasing the processing power of the servers can
mitigate the time constraints, however this has a hardware cost implication. This will be confirmed through detailed requirements

Fall Back Procedures: Manual journal if summarised, however if all transactions are sent to POL FS then this is not an option. In this
instance there is no fall back position to this flow. Resilience needs to be built into the system in order that the interface can be recovered
as quickly as possible.

Security risks:

The risk involved in this data flow is corporate fraud.

There is also the possibility that attempts to create transactions in SAP may fail due to a change in the source data, which has not been

carried forward into the logic of the interface. It is critical for the reference data updates to be done in a timely manner in order that these
transactions do not fail for that reason.

The security requirements are as outlined in the PO Ltd IS Security approach. This assesses each component and produces a security
classification. This is done where new systems are being implemented. There is no change to seourity requirements in the following
systems:

Counter Application (Horizon)

Transaction Management

Logistics Feeder Service

SAPADS

Group systems (eg. SAPHR, ES-FS, Stock Warehouse Management)

Security arrangements for Stock Reconciliation are to be determined.

1 Programme Acceptance Strategy

High high-level set of acceptance strategy for Project/System Name should be documented here based upon the requirements detailed
within this document.

Ref Description

ACM-009 A separate work strand will be initiated which defines the acceptance strategy and the detailed
acceptance criteria

ACM-010 I Acceptance tests must cover:

Functional and direct interface tests
Non-functional tests for disaster recovery

ACM-011 Successful completion of direct interface tests between POL, Fujitsu and PRISM Alliance are required to
confirm satisfactory system acceptance.

'ACM-012 _I Where appropriate, acceptance tests may be based on the outcome of design walkthroughs.

‘ACM-013 I Fujitsu Services and PRISM Alliance must support such validation/inspection of the design and
implementation as necessary for stage testing and acceptance.

12. Programme implementation a. Migration Strategy

Ref Description

ACM-014 A separate work strand will be initiated which focuses on business and technical migration

ACM-015 I There must be integrity between CBDB and the cash ledgers during the migration period

ACM-016 Cash adjustments made in Horizon must flow through to the cash ledgers

ACM-017 I Bank statements and cheques will need to be processed in both CBDB and the new system during
migration

ACM-018 I Reporting of cash will be via the new system but all other accounting reporting will continue via CBDB
during migration

ACM-019 I Existing reference data feeds need to be maintained during migration until switched over to the new
source or no longer required
