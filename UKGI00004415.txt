Subject: Briefing for Baroness Neville-Rolfe ahead of introductory meeting on Post Office

Attachment: 150528 Day 2 briefing overview pack v3.pptx

Hi Andrew

As I mentioned yesterday, please find attached some background briefing for Baroness Neville-Rolfe ahead of our
introductory meeting with her on Tuesday next week.

SoS and George Freeman offices — this is probably more detail than either of your Ministers need at the moment but
you might find the slides useful for your own reference.

We look forward to briefing the Minister on Tuesday — if there is anything else it would be helpful for us to provide (or
have to hand) please let me know.

Many thanks

Laura
