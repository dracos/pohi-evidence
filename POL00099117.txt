Thanks

I've talked Janet in JA office through these changes and she promised to put them in front of JA.

Funnily enough she misheard my name at the beginning of the call and said: “Yep, I've got the full
statement and report to send over to you." She thought I was Prodger from the BBC.

On the Sth bullet - where it makes reference to the faults or issues with the system - needs to be clear
as this I think implies the wider system rather than Horizon.

This is how I propose to go back to Janet:

- second para, final sentence: could it end at "devastated"? There is a clarity question here
which investigators do we mean, our Post Office people or ss?

- Could the third bullet change to "training and support processes which have been found to be
inadequate in some cases”

Final bullet: we don't accept that there is an unresolved question here - we provided
vi idence to SS - there is also a Fujitsu angle. We would have to respond to this particular statement

- Susan to come back to me on the sentence about ‘criminal and civil liabilities’

Hi Janet

VVVVVVVVVVYVVVVVYVVVVVYVYVVVVEVVV¥ VV VV VY

Just to update you, Matt Prodger of the BBC has called us asking for our statement, which of course we
won't provide until we have had any feedback from you.

He appears to have lined up a subpostmaster interview which he says may appear on the 6pm news.
