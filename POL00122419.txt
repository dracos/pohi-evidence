All,

148 Old Street, LONDON, EC1V 9HQ

As you will have read in the Weekly Newsletter we have now completed the production of the Training and
Development Skills Matrix and team members should complete one as part of their 121’s with line managers.
Therefore can you please start to use the attached matrix from the next 121 you hold with your direct reports?
Submitting the form by clicking the black button “Email training record” will enable us, at the end of May, to analyse
and evaluate the training and development needs of the team from which the T and D strategy for the next year/ 18
months will be formulated.

The instruction procedure is also attached but if you have any questions about using the matrix either before, during or
after 121’s please do not hesitate to contact myself or any of T and D workstream members below who will be happy
to help.
