arious progress has been made against the original sites identified:
lcamesley 279432: System performance monitoring has been running at the site,
jut the Postmaster has only reported one incident in the past six weeks
jawne 250321: Comfest diagnostic monitoring equipment has been installed at
the site to test for environmental problems affecting the monitors. So far,
Ino significant readings recorded

['recynon 441611: Postmaster has replaced the faulty fluorescent strip lights
land starters, since when the problem has not recurred. This problem is now
closed.

Riddings 376311: Keyboards and MOnitors have been swopped with no
limprovement. On site investigation showed signifcant variations in the users
nethods of operation. One incident observed, and under investigation by 3rd
lline.

cefn Glas 316611: Chomeric collars and mains filters fitted; Romec fixed
faulty alarm box, since when no further incidents. This problem is now
closed.

ld Isleworth 111025: Complete replacement of the kit at the office has
failed to resolve problem. Comfest diagnostic equipment being installed on
riday 22/06/01.

[there are four suspected potential causes of phantom transactions, namely:
lraulty screen or keyboard: resolution is to swop them out

Faulty screen power supply: resolution is to _swop it out

FUJ00086682
FUJ00086682

fiser error: resolution is for user to follow correct procedures
lexternal Environmental influence: trying to detect and identify using ComfEst
land system performance monitoring.

here environmental effects are believed to be the cause, it is hoped that
comtEst and Performance monitoring will be able to identify if the
interference is occurring at regular or specific times; if so, we may be able
to identify and address the source of the interference.

ld Isleworth reports phantom transactions still happening with resistive
nonitor. There is no logical explanation for this other than user error.

Pom has refused suggestion of FSM to stand and observe counter transactions.

lcamesley has reported an incident of a confused transaction dueing their
balancing. However, investigation from SSC showed that this was a result of
luser error, not following the correct balance sequence.

[there is now no clear evidence of any phantom transactions. Those that have
been resolved have been attributed either to faulty equipment or to user
error. There is no evidence of any software error or external interference
living rise to phantom transactions.

i will now proceed to compile a spreadsheet reflecting all the evidence to
date, and then discuss closure with the PON problem Manager - Wendell Jones
