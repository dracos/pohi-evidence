Penny

What about the paragraph when starts ‘None of these faults relate to etc’ is this now acceptable to provide this
response once we have examined fault logs.

Please find attached a copy of my initial mark up of my witness statement, which I will send to Graham Ward
this morning.

<< File: Penny's standard template Dec 05.doc >>

I have not included additional applications which Gareth highlighted, I thought I'd do that once I understood
more about them.

Please let me have any comments you may have asap.

Kind regards
Penny
