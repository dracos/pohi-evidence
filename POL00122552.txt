Legally privileged and confidential

Thanks Martin
Presumably we need to give off the signals that we are proactive, doing all the right things re writing to people to keep
the AG and CCRC calm. Hopefully if they see that they may leave us to it for the moment.

Susan,

Ihave asked Simon to draft a response tomorrow morning.

The Attorney General has no role in the referral of cases to the Court of Appeal. The Attorney
General can, however, set up an inquiry to see if there has been a miscarriage of justice. If he
determines that there has, he can refer cases to the CCRC.

The CCRC only considers Crown Court convictions when the defendant has appealed to the Court of
Appeal unsuccesfully. In relation to Magistrates Court convictions the CCRC may have a role to play.

However the correct route for a defendant would be to appeal to the Crown Court out of time.

Kind regards,

Martin.

Martin - we have received the attached from the Criminal Cases Review Commission should you draft reply on our
behalf or should we refer them to you to reply on our behalf.

There is a reference to the Attorney General - in what circumstances could the Attorney General get involved?
Thanks
