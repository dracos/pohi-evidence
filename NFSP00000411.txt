Dear Sirs

Thank you for your letter dated 30" April 2003 received on 28" May 2003.

I can advise that at the time of migration from the manual system to the
computerised one, a number of Subpostmasters complained of errors that had been
created by the system.

We have no way here of knowing whether such errors were as a result of the
computer system and, therefore, the matter was raised with Post Office Ltd. We are
advised that all cases were examined and some were found to be computer glitches
whilst others were not. \

The most productive way to proceed would be for your client to request an
investigation, as the system should be able to identify all transactions undertaken on
it. If you client is a member of our organisation we would be pleased to request such
an investigation.

Yours faithfully

COLIN BAKER
General Secretary

Dear Sirs

We have been instructed in connection with recovery of a
purported late account for a Local Post Office.

The Postmaster however is adamant that she did not take
the money. There is approximately £3,000 in dispute. Our
client vehemently believes that there was a “glitch” with
the computer system that night which can now not be
located.

We wonder whether you are aware of any additional
“glitches” with such systems.

Should you have any queries in light of the comments made
in this letter, then please do not hesitate to telephone our
Miss Helen Williams at our Swansea office upon receipt.
