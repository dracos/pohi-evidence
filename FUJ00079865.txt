Introduction

Incident Management is a service that encompasses a broad range of teams
and functions, and which links into a variety of many other service
management disciplines. Incident management within ICL Pathway also has
very close links with Incident Management in PON, and there are agreed
communications links between the two organisations.

This document details the baseline processes for incident management within
ICL Pathway.

Scope

Within the document incident management has been broken down to two
different levels.

- The first level (Section 3) provides an overview (deployed) of the complete
incident management process, highlighting the links between the different
levels of support and the support units that exist within each level.

- The next section (Section 4) breaks down of each line of support to lower
level details.

Key factors within the processes include the flow of information, and the
communication links that exist between the different teams and functions.

4 Incident Management Process

This section looks more cl

losely into what happens at each level of support,

starting with first line support through to fourth line support. Each section will
explain the inputs and outputs for each line of support and the activities that
are carried out within the support function.

4.1 First Line Support

First line support within ICL Pathway is provided by the HSH.

“The HSH deal with all technical and operational calls related to the ICL
Pathway environment or the data feeds into ICL Pathway from PON and their
clients. It provides a single point of contact for outlet staff and ICL Pathway

operation staff.” [Ref.8]

The incident management system used by the HSH is ‘Powerhelp’.

This section looks at:

Refer caller
to the NBSC

A call to the HSH can derive from a number of sources (see Section 4.1). If
the caller is ringing for an update on a particular incident the HSH provide the
caller with details of the present situation as indicated within the incident
record on Powerhelp.

If the call is a new call the HSH open a new incident record on Powerhelp and
then verify the caller [Ref.12]. If the caller fails verification the incident is
closed and no further action is taken. If the caller passes verification the HSH
take the details of the call.

If the HSH determine that the call has come through to the wrong helpdesk,
the caller is provided with the details of the NBSC and the call closed. The
only exception to this being if the caller has already been referred to the
helpdesk by the NBSC, in which case the HSH will progress the incident
[Ref.1].

The HSH will decide whether or not the incident requires immediate routing to
2°¢ line support, or whether or not the call can be resolved via Advice and
Guidance. If, after providing Advice and Guidance, the incident is still
unresolved, it is routed to 2" line support.

If the incident has been resolved after providing advice and guidance the
HSH close the incident (See Section 4.1.4 for closure process).

When routing an incident to second line support, the HSH can route the
incident to the UKSS (Section 4.2.2.1) if it is determined that an engineer is
required on site, or to the SMC (Section 4.2.1.1). See [Ref.14] for routing
criteria.

Having routed an incident to second line support the HSH will monitor it until
the incident has been resolved and is ready for closure. See Section 4.1.3.1
for the monitoring process.

The HSH regularly monitor calls that are passed to second line support. If an
incident requires action to be taken by PON or one of the outlets, then the call
is suspended until the action has been completed. The purpose of this is to
stop the SLA clock since ICL Pathway are unable to take action to resolve the
incident whilst PON or an outlet need to carry out certain tasks.

If a call is in danger of not meeting its SLA, the incident is escalated.

A Powerhelp incident can be closed by the HSH or by the SMC. However,
before closing an incident, the HSH/SMC check to ensure that, where
required, the originator of the call has agreed to close the incident. If
agreement has not been obtained, it must be sought.

If agreement is not obtained, the incident may have to be sent back to second
line support for resolution if it can not be resolved within first line support. If
there is any dispute as to whether the incident has been resolved, the issue is

escalated.

Company In Confidence Date: 13/11/00

On receipt of an incident, and after having analysed it, the SMC can either:

Resolve the incident with a KEL.
Determine that the incident is a duplicate call and link it to the original.

Decide that the call requires a UKSS engineer to visit the site (Section
4.2.2.1).

Or, failing any of the above, route the call to Third Line Support for further
investigation, either the SSC (Section 4.3.1.1) or OSD (Section 4.3.4.1).

In some cases, following analysis, the SMC will be able to close the incident
(Section 4.1.4). This happens in situations where an incident has been routed
back to the SMC, from either UKSS or third line support, for closure.

In other cases, the SMC may be required to carry out checks on an incident
returned for closure, to ensure that it has been resolved. If the incident fails
the checks, it is routed back to the appropriate support unit for further
analysis.

Having been assigned an incident the UKSS engineer visits the affected site.
If, on investigation, the engineer determines that no hardware fault exists, the
call is routed back to Powerhelp to be re-routed for resolution appropriately.

If the incident is confirmed as a hardware fault, the engineer carries out the
necessary repairs. Once the work has been completed, in order to close the
incident, the engineer must have acceptance from the Postmaster that the
fault has been repaired. This is done via the Postmaster signing an
acceptance card (SVR card). The engineer clears the call on their remote
system.

Clearing the call on the remote system routes the incident back to Powerhelp
to indicate that the call has been resolved and can be closed.

Third line support is provided by:

- The System Service Centre (SSC)

- Outsourcing Services Division (OSD)
- The Management Support Unit (MSU)
- The Reference Data Team (RDT)

4.3.1 The System Service Centre

“The aim of the SSC is to provide a support capability to Pathway that
resolves technical problems in the minimum time and with the minimum
amount of disruption to the service. The SSC aims to provide a centre of
technical expertise for Customer Service, providing technical advice,
guidance, and expertise relating to all parts of the Pathway system”. [Ref.2]

The SSC uses PinlCL as its incident management system and diagnostic

database.

management system used by the SSC). On receipt of an incident PinICL the
SSC investigate the incident.

If on investigation the SSC determine that:

- The incident was incorrectly routed, it is passed backed to the SMC to
route to the appropriate support unit (Section 4.2.1.1).

- The incident is a business incident, and not system related, it is routed
through to the MSU (Section 4.3.2.1).

- The incident is a reference data incident it is routed through to the
Reference Data Team (Section 4.3.3.1).

- The incident is a known error, it is passed backed to the SMC to deal with
(Section 4.2.1.1)

- The incident is already known, i.e. it is a duplicate incident, the SSC
associate the duplicate PinICL to the original PinlICL and close the
duplicate PinICL. Go to Section 4.3.1.3 for the SSC closure process)

If the none of the above apply, the incident is either resolved by the SSC or
routed to 4" line support for resolution. However, a decision first has to be
made as to whether a business incident is associated with the incident being
dealt with. If so, the SSC will raise a new business incident with the HSH
(Section 4.1.1).

The SSC raise a KEL for incidents that they have not come across before and
require further work and time before they are resolved. This is then used by
the SMC to stop duplicate incidents being sent through to the SSC.

If a workaround can be developed, it is added to the respective KEL to be
used as required. If the workaround requires agreement from PON, a Problem
is raised to obtain the agreement.

If the incident can not be resolved by the SSC, it is passed to 4" line support
(Section 4.4.1) for resolution. If the SSC can resolve the incident, the
appropriate actions are taken until the incident is ready for closure (Section
4.3.1.3).

The SSC monitor all the incidents passed to them through to closure. The
monitoring function extends to those incidents that are awaiting resolution on
the SSC’s incident stack and those incidents that are passed to 4" line
support for resolution.

The SSC update the incident PinlICL with regular progress reports on the
status of the incident resolution.

If the update is relevant to the HSH/SMC it is passed backed to the
Powerhelp system.

The monitoring function is a continual operation.

Once the SSC has resolved an incident, or received an incident back from 4".
line support for closure, the PinICL can be closed. The SSC contact the
originator of the incident to agree that it can be closed.

Once agreement for closure has been reached, the SSC close the incident
PinlCL. The incident is then returned back to the SMC (Section 4.2.1.1).

4.3.2 The Management Support Unit

“Reconciliation [business] incidents may arise for a number of different
reasons. In all cases there is a mismatch between the information held in
different parts of the ICL Pathway system. The task of the Management
Support Unit (MSU) is to investigate and financially resolve reconciliation
incidents. If a similar reconciliation incident occurs a number of times, the
MSU identifies it as a problem incident to be managed through the problem
management process. [Ref.3]

If on investigation the MSU notice that the incident is a duplicate, the details
of the duplicate incident are added to the existing BIMS report [Ref.9], and
the duplicate incident is closed.

If the incident is new, the MSU log the details into the BIMS/MER report
[Ref.9].

If it is not a duplicate incident the MSU initiate the BIMS process [Ref.9]. This
is the process used by the MSU to deal with the business incident. Once the
reconciliation details have been obtained by the MSU to settle the business
fault with PON (i.e. the BIMS has been ‘cleared’, the incident can be closed.

lf the MSU identify that a system fault is linked to the business incident, and
that the system fault has not yet been raised as an incident, the MSU will
raise a system fault with the HSH.

Note: MSU contact to the HSH is via the SSC.

RDT investigate the incident routed to them by the SSC, and check to ensure
that the incident is a reference data fault. If it is not, it is routed back to the
SSC for further investigation (Section 4.3.1.1).

If the incident is confirmed as a reference data fault, RDT decide whether
PON are responsible for its resolution. If so, RDT send the appropriate PON
team an email, which includes a copy of the PinICL and the HSH incident
reference number, requesting the PON team to resolve the incident. Once
PON have replied to the RDT and accepted responsibility for resolution, RDT
send the PinlCL incident back, via the SSC, for closure (Section 4.3.1.3).

If ICL Pathway is responsible for resolution, RDT decide whether they are
able to resolve the incident, or if it must be routed through to 4" line support
for resolution. If the incident requires resolution by 4" line support RDT route
the incident via PinICL to 4" line support (Section 4.4.1).

If RDT are responsible for resolution, they initiate procedures to resolve the
incident. Once the incident is resolved, it is sent back via the SSC, for closure
(Section 4.3.1.3).

OSD provide the same level of third line support as the SSC. The difference
being that in general the SSC provide 3” line support for software incidents,
whereas the OSD, in general, provide 3” line support for network and central
system related incidents.

On receipt of an incident from the SMC, OSD investigate the incident.

On occasion the OSD may determine that the incident has been incorrectly
routed, and is not an incident that the OSD can resolve. If this is the case the
incident is routed back to the SMC for re-routing, informing them as to where
the incident should be sent for resolution (Section 4.2.1.1).

If the incident does belong within OSD, the appropriate measures are taken
to resolve the incident.

Notes

i. OSD 3” line support is split into different units. The SMC is able to route an
incident to one of four of the OSD units. These are known as:

CFM1 (Unix/NT)
CFM3 (Networks)

CFM5 (Service Management)
CFM6 (VME)

ii. OSD also use 4" line support resource if they are unable to resolve an
incident themselves. However, since OSD are a supplier to ICL Pathway,
links to OSD’s 4" line support are not dealt with within this document.

Fourth line support is the final level of support within the ICL Pathway
incident management process. If an incident is routed through the first three
levels of support, it is resolved by fourth line.

4.4.1 Fourth line support incident management process

On receipt of an incident, 4" line support initiate investigation procedures
[Ref.10]. In some cases, 4" line may be able to resolve the incident without
the need for any development, or they may decide that the incident does not
require progression through fourth line. If so, the incident is routed back to 3"
line support detailing the action to be taken to resolve the incident.

If a CP is required, the Change Management process is initiated and the
incident PinICL returned to 3” line support.
If a CP is not required, the incident is sent to the appropriate development to

impact. Once impacted the Release Management Process takes over [Ref.7].
The incident is returned to 3% line support once testing has proved to be

successful.

5 Incident Management links to Problem / Business
Continuity Management

In incident can lead to a Problem [Ref.4] or a Business Continuity Incident
[Ref.5] being raised.

At any stage in the incident management process, within any line of support,
a problem can be raised. In most cases a problem will be identified at first line
support through the identification of a trend of similar incidents or a single
incident.

When raising a problem or a business continuity incident, the Customer
Service Duty Manager is paged. The Duty Manager (DM) determines if a
problem or business continuity incident exists and takes the appropriate
action. If the DM determines that neither a problem or business continuity
incident exist, the originator is informed and no further action taken.
