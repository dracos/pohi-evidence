Dear all

There appears to have been some sort of confusion regarding the trail of emails below. Gareth was asked to
supply an expert report on Horizon Integrity by the legal team and | was asked to input this onto a s.9 witness
statement in order to produce it in court. Gareth was not aware that this related to a specific case and was also
not aware that he would be required in court. I have spoken to Gareth and he is happy to attend but as explained
below it is over and above the usual BAU arrangements that we have with Fujitsu so some extra arrangement
are required in order to cover extra costs and time etc. This email is to request that please.

Sharron,

Thanks for the clarification. | had not understood that that related to a specific case, | thought that was a general
statement. If 1am required to go to court for that, | think | need to have some more background on the specific case and
exactly what is being alleged. | appreciate that is not covered by my statement, but if | need to be an expert witness, |
need to understand what is happening.

However, please note that if | am required to do anything further on this, some commercial arrangements will need to
be made to cover my time and costs since | am not covered by the normal Security Service that POL pay for. Perhaps

you can sort out the details of this with Penny when she is back from leave next week. (The process takes a while so

leaving it until it is known if | am required may be too late.)

Hi Gareth
This is the one that you supplied the expert report and witness statement for the week before last. Apologies for
not explaining that properly in the previous email, it was a blanket email for all witnesses! It is unclear at this

stage who will be required as witnesses and which evidence will be accepted without the need for attendance. I
just thought if I let everyone know they can pencil it in and then I can let you all know nearer the time.

Andy

The same applies to you. It is unlikely you will be required in court but I thought I would copy you in just in
case.

Apologies for any confusion I have caused.

Sharron,
Sorry, but I’m not aware of this case or what might be required of me. (I have no problem with 14" Jan though.)

’'m not aware of any outstanding cases which | might be involved in.
