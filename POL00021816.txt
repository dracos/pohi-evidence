Jamail

Second Sight have produced a draft of their "Part 2 Report" (attached). This report is supposed to draw together their
analysis of any thematic issues that affect Applicants generally. The intention is that, once finalised, this report will be
sent to Applicants with SS' individual case review reports.

In general, the Part 2 Report is very poor quality and Post Office have responded to Second Sight highlighting all the
inaccuracies and deficiencies (see attached). We are waiting to see if SS will take these comments on-board in a revised
draft due shortly.

In the meantime, would you or CK be able to review the Report and advise on whether, at this stage, the draft report gives
rise to criminal law issues (I'm thinking in particular about whether there are any disclosure issues)?

Kind regards
Andy
