ISRDB_AUD_FEED ran just the once (not twice as I initially feared) so no duplicate files have been created.

Passing back to Gerald to investigate the possibility that the AUD files have been gathered twice.

ions.

n the day in question, 24th October 2015, the audited share was migrated. Because of some problems doing this the audit
configuration file was temporarily edited and ?pnas002? was changed to ?lprplmf001?. This caused files to be gathered twice
because the gatherer relies on the full hierarchic path of the file being gathered to be the same to prevent it gathering a file
ls second time.

It attach a file of all the audit logging done which includes the word AUDIT20151024083001. This shows the problem developing.

the duplicate transactions are because files generated on the 24th October 2015 were gathered twice due to an error in the
process of migrating the share on which they lay from one platform to another. The data the spread sheets produced is completely
valida.
