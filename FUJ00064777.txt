lf} Response

IT know what caused this problem. It was because reference data was not sent
to the outlests concerning P&A products--The cash settlement was mapped to
the CA, but the corresponding transaction was not. If these transactions
lwere recorded by in the Counter Transaction Exceptions report I could supply
PocL TP with this information myself, but they have not been recorded.

can you supply the offending non mapped transactions to this PinICL in
message store extact so I can reconcile with Chesterfield?

IF} Response :

this difference in the receipt and Payment totals was caused by the fact that
non-core reference data was not delivered to this office in time.

the reference data was for OBCS products 177 to 185.

s this reference data included primary mappings for these products these
Jproducts could not be mapped to the cash account at stock unit rollover.
this is what caused the difference in the receipt and payment totals.
his incident is related to 9 others all caused by this same problem. All
the offices effected were migrated to Horizon on 20/7/00.

11 the offending transactions took place 21/7/00-- when there was not
reference data at the outlets.
fhe correct reference data was delivered for business on 22/7/00.

x have provided with the final BIM report an excel spread sheet (with the
same file name as the BIM report) listing the offending transactions which
Jwere not mapped to the cash account.
