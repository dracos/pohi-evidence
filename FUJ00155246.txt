Gareth,

That reads well to me so, subject to Anne’s confirmation, I’m happy with it.

Cheers, John

John,
I propose sending the following to Mike Stewart to pass on to POL:
Does that seem OK?
Anne: Have I got my facts right? Are you happy about being referred to?

Mike,
Presumably this is the action that Shaun is chasing you about:
Provide detailed explanation of the issue that impacted Craigpark BIM BE-0158102.

I have checked this out and we have seen this happen only 3 times in the life of TP since $90 (2 years +) and it has
happened Twice at Craigpark once which was benign. It was decided at the time that there could be a fix introduced (I
understand what is being proposed for the bug fix and if it were to go wrong could impact the whole estate so avoiding such
a fix sounds like the correct decision).

I suggest we reply to Shaun as follows:

1. We are aware of a very rare timing problem in Horizon that results in data from the Stock Unit Rollover Process
not being recorded correctly while a Stock Unit is Balancing

2. This results in a non-zero Trading Balance on the BTS and so is very visible to the Postmasters

3. We have identified only two occurrences of this problem in the last 2 years - one of which was at CraigPark in
December 2007 as described previously by Anne Chambers of Fujitsu's SSC

4. Asymptom of this timing problem is the occurrence of a specific event in the Event Log (a diagnostic tool which
is separate from the message journal). This event occurs fairly frequently for all sorts of reasons. However most
occurrences of this event in the Event Log are benign. Anne did note a benign occurrence of this event at
CraigPark in February 2008. As she reported in the request about CraigPark, she carried out detailed checks of
every rollover of that branch and was satisfied that the February event was benign, and there was only a system
problem in December.

5. Therefore a more accurate description of the problem is that we have many occurrences of a timing event in the
Event Logs. We have identified two occurrences of this event in the last 2 years which have resulted in an
accounting problem and the rest appear to be benign. One of the occurrences of the accounting problem was at
Craig Park and we have at least one other occurrence of the event at Craig Park which has been investigated
and shown to be benign.

6. We do have a possible mitigation for the timing problem as identified in the 2 cases of an accounting problem
being generated. However given the fact that the accounting problem has only occurred twice in two years we
were of the opinion that the risk of attempting to fix the problem may well outweigh the benefit of such a fix. This
decision is being reviewed again in light of this action following the normal Fujitsu processes for deciding which
problems are worth fixing.

Does that cover everything?
Regards

Gareth
