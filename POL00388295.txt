Thanks. That will be fine on the letter, certainly, and I am sure we can cover off the logistics too.

T also agree re attendees.

Is it unreasonable to ask for a draft response on Monday? Nothing will go tomorrow so don't rush for then. I'd
have thought a "warmed up" version of the letter we have drafted would probably do it.

Probably just needs a cover email with a handling plan too detailing who will attend, a call from PV to BNR
beforehand etc

Let me know if there is anything I can do to help. I will let you know if the Minister's office calls.

I share that view re Paula and I am similarly concerned about the line in the letter which Mark has
identified. There is no decision in this for Government.

As to attendees, I agree with Mark.

Hi Tom

I agree re Paula point and this was also her view when we spoke this morning. And I also agree
that she should speak to her in advance.

I am worried a little by the line about govt considering whether further action is needed after the
meeting.

I suggest we reply as warmly as possible to the letter, especially as it is from BNR.

If timings do not work for Jane then I suggest that I should attend along with Patrick. But I am
open to other views on this.

Please see attached that has just arrived. I assume we should seek to respond quickly.

It is still my view that Paula should not attend but should perhaps speak to BNR
beforehand? However, I am very open to contrary views.

Tom cc. Mark, Patrick
Please see attached letter from Baroness Neville-Rolfe to Paula regarding Monday’s
adjournment debate on Horizon. I’d be grateful if you could pass on to her (I think this has

gone in hard copy only).

If you have any questions or would like to discuss then do get in touch.
