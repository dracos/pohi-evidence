Subject: Service Management Review & Scorecard

Good morning,

Following on from the recent approval to proceed with the new format for the SMR, please find attached the
summary presentation, the SDM templates and the adjusted scorecard.

The following things have been taken into consideration and passed on to the customer:

e Scorecard does not align appropriately e.g. Branch & Central Network, Data Centres and Problem
Management do not have Scorecards but we have mis-aligned scores for DFD and Online Services. This will
remain as is for this month but will be amended over the next month or so.

® Capacity Management will keep its current review but ensure there is an summary update provided for the
SMR

e — Security will be provided as a summary update: it is not currently clear if the scorecard relationship is correct.

For those of you completing a presentation, please see the attached template for use and the scorecard questions you
will use to interview your counterpart. I will be available for any 1:1 support in completing these presentations and
scope out any adjustments to the style (e.g. Risk & MIM).

For Security and all Service Transition presentations you will not need to use the attached template as I appreciate
you have a rather different approach; you will however still need to conduct the interview with your counterpart so
your scorecard is completed.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you need any further assistance.

Kind Regards
