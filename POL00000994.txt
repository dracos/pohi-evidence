Recovery of overwritten transactions at FAD
519519

FAD 519519 cannot balance their stock units and office correctly because a number of transactions have
been overwritten as a result of comms issues and counter swaps.

Options for resolving this issue have been discussed with POL (Lynne Steer, Contract and Service
Manager, _}and POA have been given the go-ahead to restore the missing transactions. This
will have the side-effect of putting the outlet back into CAP 24.

Justification: Outlet cannot produce a consistent balance/cash account.
When: Action taken on 14/09/2005 18:00

Extra detail: Due to problems with the gateway, which has been replaced twice, and communications
firstly between the gateway and the data centre, and then the replaced gateway and the other counters, a
tun of just over 2000 messages have been used twice.

As a result, the branch cannot see approximately 900 transactions done on the gateway between 13:02 on
9th Sept and 11:46 on 12th Sept. If they attempt to balance their stock units and office while in this state,
the system will report large discrepancies.

To get the messages back, we will delete the counter messagestores and let the version from the
correspondence server replicate down. The missing transactions will now appear on the system. However
messages written between 10:53 7th Sept and 11:38 8th Sept, including the stock unit rollovers, will not
appear. We will reinsert the transactions which were completed in that time, and reset the stockunit and
CAP objects so the outlet reverts to CAP 24.

They will then be able to redo the CAP 24 balance which will now cover all transactions from the start of
CAP 24 until now.
