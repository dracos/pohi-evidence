Methodology

The Postmaster survey was carried out online and administered by our research agency, Quadrangle
The survey was live for Post masters to complete between 8" March and 24 April 2024

1,917 responses were completed by Postmasters — the highest number since the survey started in 2021

Executive Summary

Postmaster views of Post Office have polarised somewhat in 2024. Overall, Postmasters are more likely to believe that their
relationship with Post office has declined, but the proportion giving the top rating has increased.

Similarly, the proportion of Postmasters feeling supported has decreased, but again, the proportion giving the top rating
has increased.

Levels of Trust have declined since the Pulse survey (Oct/Nov 2023), returning to similar levels to those recorded in March
2023.

Remuneration (alongside the available range of Post Office products and services) remains the top priority for Postmasters
~ itis spontaneously mentioned as the main desired improvement, and it is the poorest performing of the top priority areas
in terms of perceived improvement. In general, Postmasters are most interested in things which are going to have a direct
impact on the day-to-day running of their branch(es) and help drive income.

Awareness of some key initiatives is high, as is their perceived usefulness, particularly the introduction of multiple carriers in
branch, the ability to order a range of marketing materials via Branch Hub, and Branch Hub features being available on
Horizon. As in previous waves, there is evidence that the more initiatives Postmasters are aware of, the more positively they
feel about Post Office.

Around half of Postmasters say that 2024 media coverage has had a negative impact on staff morale, and trust and
reputation in their community. While an impact on footfall and sales is less evident, still around four-in-ten postmasters
say they have been impacted.

Although the results have moved backwards, this is understandable given the significant publicity surrounding the
organisation in recent months, and there is a platform to build greater positive sentiment in the coming year. a
