POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY

THIRD CORPORATE STATEMENT OF FUJITSU SERVICES LIMITED

INTRODUCTION

1.

lam a director of Fujitsu Services Limited (“Fujitsu”) and am duly authorised to
make this statement on its behalf. | make this statement in response to the
Inquiry’s Rule 9 Requests, dated 16 June 2023 and 31 July 2023, for a corporate
statement addressing issues relevant to Phases 3 and 4 of the Inquiry (the
“Requests’). In particular, the Requests focus on the provision and content of
Audit Record Query (“ARQ”) data by Fujitsu to Post Office Limited (“POL”) over

time.

As noted in the First and Second Corporate Statements dated 28 September
2022 and 29 December 2022 respectively (the “First and Second Corporate
Statements’), | do not have first-hand knowledge of many of the matters which
are set out in this corporate statement. For this reason, | wish to reiterate at the
outset how the information in this statement has been compiled. As with the

responses in the First and Second Corporate Statements, responses to

Page 1 of 103

WITN06650300
WITN06650300
questions set out in this statement are generally drawn from documentary
sources. For the purposes of preparing this statement, | have been assisted by
a team of individuals within Fujitsu and Morrison Foerster. This is due to the vast
amount of documentation and sources of evidence which have had to be
reviewed for a time period stretching over 25 years. This team has provided to
me the documents which are referenced in this statement and exhibited in
accordance with the index at the back of this statement, and which are the
principal source of my knowledge of this statement’s content. In addition to
available documentary evidence, | have also been provided with the witness
statements of three Fujitsu employees (John Simpkins, Jonathan Hulme and
Gerald Barnes) who have also provided responses to the Requests based on
their own personal knowledge or recollections (the “Fujitsu Witness

Statements’).

The responses provided in this third corporate statement represent Fujitsu’s
current understanding of the information available. Given that work in relation to
Phase 4 and other phases of the Inquiry is still on-going, it may be that Fujitsu
will need to supplement this corporate statement as further material is identified

and made available to Core Participants.

Further, as noted in the First and Second Corporate Statements, | do not have a
detailed technical knowledge of the Horizon IT System (“Horizon”) and | am
reliant upon Fujitsu staff with relevant technical expertise and knowledge of such

matters.

5. For ease of reference, in this statement:

a. ICL Pathway Limited (which initially managed the Horizon contract,
and later novating the contract to Fujitsu Services Limited) and Fujitsu

Services Limited will be referred to collectively as “Fujitsu”; and

b. Post Office Counters Limited (subsequently Post Office Limited) will

be referred to collectively as “POL”).

CONTRACTUAL BACKGROUND

6. From the outset of Horizon, Fujitsu has been required by contract to maintain an
audit trail of “all Transactions and Events...” (see for example paragraph 3.1 of
Schedule AO3 to the Codified Agreement entered into between Fujitsu and POL
on 28 July 1999 (the “1999 Codified Agreement”), and paragraph 3.1 of
Schedule D5 to version 13 of the Codified Agreement which was entered into by
Fujitsu and POL on 23 November 2020 (the “2020 Codified Agreement’)).' This
contractual obligation flowed from Requirement 699 contained at paragraph
1.102 of Schedule A15 to the 1999 Codified Agreement. In particular,

Requirement 699 notes at:

a. Paragraph 1.102.6: “The content of the audit trail shall be agreed with

POCL by a date consistent with the Project Plan.”

b. Paragraph 1.102.9: “The audit trail shall have a level of security such

that it cannot be altered or deleted.”

* FUJ00000071; FUJ00000003

Page 3 of 103
c. Paragraph 1.102.11: “The audit trail shall comply with Requirement
829", namely the prosecution support Requirement set out at

paragraph 1.133 of Schedule A15 to the 1999 Codified Agreement.

Fujitsu’s solution for Requirement 699 is set out in Schedule A16 to the 1999
Codified Agreement. During the course of 1999-2000, this solution was amended
by Change Control Notice (“CCN”) 0423a to include the following additional
wording “[t]he audit trail is specified in the Audit Trail Functional Specification.’*
CCN 0423a also introduced the Audit Trail Functional Specification document
(version 3.0 dated 1 July 1999 at the relevant time)* as a Contract Controlled
Document (“CCD”) to be agreed between Fujitsu and POL. In order to assist the
Inquiry, Fujitsu sets out at Appendix 1 to this corporate statement a schedule of
approved Audit Trail Functional Specification documents from version 3.0
onwards. In accordance with paragraph 3.3 of Schedule D5 to the 2020 Codified
Agreement, the Audit Trail Functional Specification continues to be a CCD as

agreed between Fujitsu and POL.

THE ARQ SPREADSHEET

8.

With the first of the Requests, the Inquiry enclosed a spreadsheet containing
transaction and event data for the Marine Drive Post Office branch with unique
Financial Accounts Division (“FAD”) Code 213337 (“Marine Drive”) dating from
2 February 2004 (the “ARQ Spreadsheet”,* pages 17 and 18 only). Fujitsu has
now been made aware that the ARQ Spreadsheet forms part of a larger

document. However, for the avoidance of doubt, in preparing this statement,

? See CCN 0423a at FUJ00000394, and confirmation that the CCN was approved in the document
entitled ‘Change Control Notices Applied’ and dated 23 October 2010 (FUJ00001431)

WITN06650300

Fujitsu understands that the Inquiry requires consideration of pages 17 and 18
of LCAS0001383 only, and does not require consideration of the remaining
pages of the document. Fujitsu also understands from the Inquiry that the ARQ
Spreadsheet was provided to Mr Lee Castleton, a former postmaster of Marine

Drive, by way of disclosure in the civil case of POL v Lee Castleton.>

9. By way of background, Fujitsu has to date identified two requests for Audit
Request Queries (the “ARQ Requests”) submitted by Graham Ward (Casework
Manager, POL) to Fujitsu in relation to Marine Drive for Horizon data dating from
the period in which Mr Castleton was postmaster at the branch. These ARQ
Requests are dated 26 October 2005 and 4 November 2005,° and request
various data from the period 1 January 2004 to 31 March 2004 (the “ARQ Date
Range’). The first of the ARQ Requests includes a request for disclosure of the

following information:

“Please also conduct an analysis of all Helpdesk calls for the above period,

commenting on any calls that may indicate faults / problems with the system

Please also supply a report of all transactions and events for the office for the
relevant days, including remittances received, transfers between stock units and

error notices.

We would like the following format for logs (in Excel format with each category in

a separate column):

® Case number HQ05X02706, Judgment Citation [2007] EWHC 5 (QB) (LCAS0000649)
® ARQ 0506/405 dated 26 October 2005 (FUJ00152562) and ARQ 0506/421-423 dated 4 November
2005 (FUJ00152564)

ID; Transaction Type; Amount £p

2 columns specifying whether an OBCS (& state) of scan accompanied the

transaction

(Session Indicator is whatever way the system has of indicating that individual

transactions are linked)”.

The second of the ARQ Requests does not include any reference to Helpdesk
calls but otherwise appears to be substantially the same as the first. In each of

the ARQ Requests, Mr Ward confirms that no witness statement is required.

It appears from contemporaneous records collected by Fujitsu that (i) the
Helpdesk call logs requested were provided to POL on a CD on 2 November
2005 (see email correspondence from Brian Pinder (Security Manager, Fujitsu)
to Mr Ward on 22 November 2005),’ and (ii) the ARQ data requested was also
provided to POL by CD during the course of November 2005 (see email
correspondence from Mr Pinder to Penny Thomas (Security, Fujitsu) also on

22 November 2005).®

The ARQ extraction process that Fujitsu understands was in place in the context
of prosecution support at the time the ARQ Requests were made is set out in
version two of the ‘Network Banking Management of Prosecution Support’

procedure document dated 29 February 2005 (the “2005 Prosecution Support

Process’). The originator of the 2005 Prosecution Support Process was
recorded as being Beatrice Neneh Lowther (Security, Fujitsu), with additional
contributors listed as Bill Mitchell (Security Manager, Fujitsu), Ms Thomas, Jan
Holmes (Quality Assurance Manager, Fujitsu) and Alan Holmes (Audit, Fujitsu).
The approval authorities for the 2005 Prosecution Support Process are listed as
Mr J. Holmes, Mr Mitchell and Dave Baldwin (Customer Service Director,

Fujitsu).

13. Section 7 of the 2005 Prosecution Support Process includes a graphic setting
out the steps followed by Fujitsu when responding to ARQ requests from POL.

According to section 3.3 of the 2005 Prosecution Support Process, the initial step
for responding to an ARQ request at the time was to identify the search criteria
to be applied. These search criteria are said to generally have been limited to the

data fields below, although Fujitsu understands that these fields could be varied

e. transaction start time and date;

f. customer session ID;

g. mode (e.g., serve customer);

h. — product number;

i. product quantity; and

je sales value.

All of these fields appear to be contained within the ARQ Spreadsheet.

In order to obtain the relevant ARQ data, section 7.1 of the 2005 Prosecution
Support Process explains the steps that the relevant Fujitsu analyst then had to

take, including:

a. Searching and selecting the necessary files from audit archive and

extract them to the audit server.

b. Generating a messagestore for the files extracted.

c. Using the RQuery tool to select the fields necessary for the relevant
ARQ request and then exporting those fields to an Excel 95 document

(or native format if requested).

d. Burning the exported data to a “‘closed’ CD-W’ in addition to a Word

document providing an explanation of the format in which the data was

Page 9 of 103

WITN06650300
WITN06650300
WITN06650300
WITN06650300

provided. According to section 7.1.7 of the 2005 Prosecution Support
Process, the CD-W was to be labelled with the ARQ reference
number, the FAD Code for the relevant branch, the name of the Fujitsu
employee who compiled the data, the date on which compilation of
the data was completed, the date range requested in the relevant
ARQ request and the name of the Fujitsu employee who checked the

data on the CD-W.
e. Checking the CD-W for viruses using anti-virus software.

f. Despatching the CD-W to the POL Casework Manager by Special

Delivery.

17. If these steps were followed in relation to the ARQ Spreadsheet, it follows that
the data it contained would have been provided to POL in an Excel 95 format on
a CD-W which was delivered in hard copy by post. It does not appear from the
contemporaneous process documents available that Fujitsu would have had
sight of how the information was subsequently shared by POL (either in whole or

part) with Mr Castleton.

18. Further detail in relation to the practical steps to be taken when extracting audit
data are set out in the “ARQ Data Extraction Process” documents in place over
time.’ A schedule of the various ARQ Data Extraction Processes and

prosecution support process documents that Fujitsu has identified to date and

19.

which appear to have been in place over time is set out in Appendix 2 to this

corporate statement.

The Inquiry has asked Fujitsu to confirm whether, in its view, the ARQ data
provided to POL over time was sufficient to enable a postmaster to understand
whether Horizon was operating correctly at their branch. In light of (i) the
evidence heard by the Inquiry from postmasters during the Human Impact
hearings, (ii) the evidence set out in the Fujitsu Witness Statements, and (iii) the
matters set out in this corporate statement in relation to the ARQ Spreadsheet,
Fujitsu cannot confirm that ARQ data on its own was sufficient to enable a
postmaster to understand whether Horizon was operating correctly at the

relevant branch in the time period covered by the ARQ data requested by POL.

AVAILABILITY OF ARQ DATA

20.

21.

In the first of the Requests, the Inquiry sought disclosure from Fujitsu of the
“original log files in their raw form” for the data reflected in the ARQ Spreadsheet.
The Inquiry also asked for confirmation as to whether the data had been reliably
and accurately parsed from the “original raw form” to the ARQ Spreadsheet. In
the context of the ARQ process, Fujitsu understands that “original log data” or
“raw data files” may refer either to (i) data recorded in the audit archive from
which the Riposte messagestore in Legacy Horizon and ARQs were extracted,

or (ii) the Riposte messagestore itself.

Fujitsu understands that, until CCN 1122 dated 5 January 2004,1" the retention

policy for data stored in Fujitsu's audit archive was 18 months.’ Following the

"* FUJ00000918

WITN06650300

23.

introduction of CCN 1122, this data retention period was increased from
18 months to 7 years. It appears that this remained the policy until 2014, when
Commercial Terms (“CT”) 1542 dated 2 June 2014"? was agreed between POL
and Fujitsu. In accordance with CT 1542, from around June 2014, data purging
activities in relation to audit and call data were suspended and this arrangement
was envisaged to last for 12 months. Since then, the agreement to suspend data
purging activities relating to audit and call data has been renewed periodically"4
and remains in place at the date of this corporate statement.’® On this basis,
Fujitsu has retained in its audit archive, audit data dating from around June 2007

onwards.

Fujitsu can therefore confirm that the audit data for Marine Drive within the ARQ
Date Range is no longer available in its audit archive. The only way that audit
data from during/before 2007 would now be available to Fujitsu is if employees
at Fujitsu made copies of the relevant data and stored it separately from the audit

archive.

To identify if any copies of audit data relating to Marine Drive from the time of
Mr Castleton’s tenure as postmaster there still exist outside of the audit archive,
Fujitsu undertook searches of documents it has collected into hard copy archives
and its Relativity platform. In doing so, Fujitsu identified a CD labelled “ARQs,
Message store, Marine Drive, 12/03/04 — 02/04/04”. The data from this CD, which

consisted of two documents, had already been collected and processed into

13 FUJ00156946
‘4 FUJ00176279 ; FUJ00176274; FUJ00176278; FUJ00176275; FUJ00176276; FUJ00176277
18 FUJ00176277

Page 12 of 103

WITN06650300
WITN06650300
Fujitsu’s Relativity platform at the time of the Requests. The two documents

contained on the CD are as follows:

a. a .txt file containing the Riposte messagestore for Marine Drive for the

period 12 March 2004 to 2 April 2004;"° and

b. an Excel spreadsheet which appears to split each of the messages in
the messagestore described above into separate rows, with a column

for each attribute."”

24. Although these documents do not contain the messagestore data for the
2 February 2004 date reflected in the ARQ Spreadsheet, Fujitsu has produced
both the above-mentioned documents to the Inquiry and exhibits them to this

statement.

25. As is clear from the messagestore that has been identified, each message
relating to Marine Drive began with “<Message:<Groupld:213337>”" (213337
being the FAD Code for the branch). Accordingly, Fujitsu ran searches for this
identifier across its Relativity platform. Regrettably, no additional responsive
documents were found. It follows that Fujitsu is unable to identify and produce

Marine Drive messagestore data for 2 February 2004.

THE RELIABILITY OF ARQ DATA

26. The Inquiry has asked whether Fujitsu is aware of any cases where an ARQ log

produced for the purpose of court proceedings against postmasters (i) may not

27.

have accurately matched the “original log files”, or (ii) was, or may be, unreliable

(together, “ARQ Reliability’).

In the course of Fujitsu’s investigations to date, a number of incidents that may
have impacted either the underlying audit trail from which ARQ data is extracted
or the ARQ extracts themselves have been identified. Fujitsu’s investigations
have included both document searches and discussions with relevant current
employees. The incidents identified by Fujitsu to date are described in more
detail below. Given the expansive period covered by the Inquiry’s Requests, and
the limitations of relying on and interpreting records of technical matters (some
of which may be incomplete), without the benefit of guidance or explanation from
relevant employees with contemporaneous knowledge, Fujitsu cannot be sure
that the incidents contained in this corporate statement are exhaustive. To the
extent that Fujitsu identifies further incidents relevant to the issue of ARQ
Reliability after the date of this corporate statement, Fujitsu will inform the Inquiry

as soon as possible. By way of summary, the incidents identified to date are as

follows:

During its investigations to date, | understand that Fujitsu has identified
approximately 2,400 ARQ requests dating from November 2002 onwards. For
the reasons highlighted in paragraph 27 above, it has not been possible to
conduct a forensic investigation into the ARQ Reliability of the audit data supplied

to POL in response to each ARQ request.

The following summaries of incidents which Fujitsu has identified as having a
potential impact on the issue of ARQ Reliability have been prepared from
documents produced to the Inquiry. The incidents addressed in these summaries

are not within my personal knowledge or recollection.

BROKEN AUDIT TRAIL

Background

30.

31.

In or around May 2001, it was identified that there was a data loss in the audit
trail for a six-day period in August 2000 (the “Broken Audit Trail”)."® At this time,
audit data was gathered by an audit server and written to Digital Linear Tape
(‘DLT’) tapes for long-term storage, to be retrieved when needed."? There were
two “Data Centres”, located at Bootle and Wigan, which contained the main
Horizon servers.”° Audit data could be accessed at audit workstations at either

site or Fujitsu's Feltham HQ.?"

According to PinICL PC0066318, which was opened on 24 May 2001, the Broken

Audit Trail issue related to “[aJn incomplete TMS audit trail for the period 8 to

14" August 2000 caused by coincidental DLT failure at both datacentres” in
Bootle and Wigan.” The problem was compounded when one of the tapes from
the Wigan Data Centre was lost in transit while in the possession of a courier

company, TNT Couriers (“TNT”) on its way to Feltham for further analysis.

32. As set out below, Fujitsu took various actions to mitigate the impact of the Broken

Audit Trail, including:

a. Engaging with TNT regarding attempts to locate the tape from the
Wigan Data Centre. Ultimately, neither Fujitsu nor TNT were able to

locate the tape.”4

b. Attempting to recover the data from the Bootle tape, with the
assistance of third-party data recovery specialists, Vogon Data
Recovery (Vogon”). Vogon concluded that there was a flaw in the

DLT media, and that recovery would only be 85% successful.”

c. Obtaining data from other archived sources. This was said to have

reduced the break in the audit trail from 6 days to 1 day.

d. Introducing automated media management and a "read after write"

process to mitigate the risk of the problem re-occurring.””

Identification and notification of the Broken Audit Trail

33.

34.

According to a letter from Jan Holmes (Quality & Audit Manager, Fujitsu) to Sue
Kinghorn (Consignia, later Royal Mail, Internal Audit) dated 23 May 2001, Fujitsu
identified the Broken Audit Trail when undertaking an audit data extraction for
Charles Leighton (Internal Crime Manager, POL), in relation to an ARQ request
(‘ARQ 8”). It appears that data for the period 8 to 14 August (the “relevant
period”) was held on four DLT tapes.”9 In order to retrieve the data, the tapes
needed to be read by dedicated “Legato” equipment and software.°° Legato
failed to read one of the tapes held at the Wigan Data Centre, and retrieval of the
data from that tape therefore failed. The tape was dispatched via TNT to Fujitsu’s
Feltham offices for further investigation and, although track and trace facilities

were employed, the tape was lost in transit.*"

Fujitsu subsequently attempted to source the outstanding data from the
corresponding DLT tape held at the Bootle Data Centre for the same period.
Recovery was attempted internally and externally using Vogon, “a recognised
industry expert in the field of data retrieval services’.6? Vogon concluded that
there was “a flaw in the DLT media and recover would only be 85% successful.
This is no more than [Fujitsu] could do ourselves...A similar scenario would have

been expected from the lost Wigan tape” .°>

35. The Broken Audit Trail was initially reported to POL as follows:

a. On 9Q May 2001, Mr Leighton was notified that Fujitsu was unable to

source the evidential data requested.*4

b. Ina letter dated 23 May 2001, Mr J. Holmes informed Ms Kinghorn of
the issue and explained that “/tlhe break has arisen due to a
combination of events outside [Fujitsu's] immediate control but it does
mean that we are not able to retrieve TMS records for that 6 day

period. All other elements of the audit trail are complete.*>

c. Also on 23 May 2001, the issue was discussed by representatives of

Fujitsu and POL during a Contract Administration Meeting.°*

36. According to the minutes of the 23 May 2001 Contract Administration Meeting,
Keith Baines (Head of Commercial, POL) asked Colin Lenton-Smith
(Commercial and Finance Director, Fujitsu) “if a Security impact on the loss of
the data had been performed and what validation process for the tapes was in

place”3”

37. MrJ. Holmes and Graham Hooper (Security Manager, Fujitsu) were the assigned
Fujitsu Problem Managers for PinICL PC0066318.5° On 24 May 2001, they
prepared the following responses to the questions raised by Mr Baines at the 23

May 2001 Contract Administration Meeting:°°

WITN06650300

a. In relation to the security impact of the data loss: “/n the event that a

third party obtained the necessary Legato equipment and software, it
is evident from the fact that the tape could not be read on the
dedicated equipment at the datacentres that any attempt by a third
party to do the same would not prove fruitful. Specialist data recovery
equipment is available primarily to forensic recovery experts such as
Vogon International, to whom Pathway referred the corrupted Bootle
tape for analysis. These companies operate strict controls to ensure
that data recovery is attempted only for legitimate reasons. Assuming
a third party succeeded where Fujitsu failed or managed to utilise
other specialist recovery services, the information on the tape is not
in a readily interpretable format and it is not possible to infer to what it

relates.”

b. In relation to data validation: “The validity of the data held, and

subsequently retrieved, is proven through the generation of a
ChecksumSeal at the time that the data is written to the DLT. This
value is stored on a database, separate from the audit data, and
subject to an entirely independent backup process. When data is
retrieved from the DLT the Checksum Value is re-calculated and the
result compared with the original value maintained in the database.
The results are recorded in the database and these are checked as

part of the Extraction process prior to despatch of data to PON.”

38. Mr Hooper notified Richard Benton (Problem Manager, POL) of the issue on 24

May 2001 and recorded his summary of this conversation in PinICL PC0066318

Page 19 of 103
39.

as follows: “/ stressed that back-ups were taken and the problem resulted from a
corruption of both tapes relevant to the period in question - a situation that could
not reasonably have been foreseen. It is clear that Consignia’s prime issue is in
attempting to recover the lost data — primarily in respect of evidence to support
potential prosecutions....The cause of the read error on the Wigan tape is
unknown and resulted in the decision to forward this to FELO1 for analysis (during
which it was lost by TNT)...lt was agreed that the only reasonable progression
was to try and locate the lost Wigan tape so that an analysis and data recovery
attempt could be performed. To this end | advised that | had been trying to get
TNT to undertake a search but was not content that TNT were doing all they

could to find the tape” .4°

The Broken Audit Trail issue was also reported in a Customer Service Monthly
Report dated 30 May 2001.*" This report stated that “/t]he issue has been raised
with the Customer and will be managed under normal problem management
procedures. The requirement to undertake large data extractions continues to

have a detrimental effect on the availability of the audit servers’.

Attempts by Fujitsu to recover the lost audit data

Correspondence with TNT regarding the missing tape

40.

In the first instance, as agreed during the call between Mr Hooper and Mr Benton
on 24 May 2001, Fujitsu engaged with TNT in order to attempt to locate the lost

Wigan tape. Accordingly, Mr Hooper wrote to TNT on 25 May 2011 requesting

assistance with locating the package containing the missing tape.‘? Fujitsu has
not to date identified copies of the correspondence with TNT but is aware of their

existence from the extracts recorded within the relevant PinICL.

TNT responded to this letter on 3 June 2001, “apologising for the loss and stating
that there had been a discrepancy in the tracking system, which could have
contributed to the problem’ .*3 Mr Hooper reported in PinICL PC0066318 that he
was “convinced that they are not trying hard enough to locate this package which
must be somewhere in their system. | propose to respond and to ask that a
search of all unaccounted-for items be made”.“ In the meantime, Fujitsu advised
POL that TNT was “no longer being used for the transport of media or other

sensitive audit/security information” “>

On 20 June 2001, Mr Hooper again wrote to TNT “stressing the importance of
finding the missing item and offering assistance in attending TNT sites to identify
the package”.*° When no response was received from TNT by 26 June 2001, a

“[c]hase up letter’ was sent.4”

TNT responded on 13 August 2001, stating that “they have recently introduced
a database of missing items, which can be searched against details of package
contents.”48 Following an “extensive check’ of this database, TNT confirmed on
23 August 2001 that the package containing the missing Wigan tape was not

recorded on their system. TNT concluded that they had undertaken everything

possible to locate the lost tape and apologised for “the difficulties this had caused

Fujitsu and any other third party’ 49

Following receipt of TNT’s last letter, Mr Hooper reported in PinICL PC0066318
that he was “now satisfied that there is no possibility of finding this tape. In any
event it needs to be borne in mind that the tape in question was corrupt before

despatch so the likelihood of data recovery from it was negligible” .©°

Rebuilding the audit trail

45.

Fujitsu also explored the possibility of re-constituting the missing data in the audit
archive using back up tapes from the Correspondence Server (“CS”).5' This was
discussed at a Joint Audit & Security Panel Meeting on 18 June 2001, attended
by Mr Leighton and Gary Potts (PON Internal Audit, POL) on behalf of POL, and
Mr J. Holmes and Mr Hooper on behalf of Fujitsu.5? According to the minutes of
this meeting, Mr J. Holmes and Mr Hooper explained the background to the

Broken Audit Trial and informed Mr Leighton that:

a. Fujitsu would be introducing a “read after write” procedure that would
provide assurance that data is not corrupt when written to tape.*? The
purpose of the “read after write” activity was to protect against the
accidental use of flawed media, but it would not guarantee that similar
problems would not occur in the future as it would only provide

assurance that the tape could be read at that moment in time.5*

b. Fujitsu was also exploring the possibility of recovering the missing

data from Correspondence Server backup tapes.®>

On 26 July 2001, Change Proposal (“CP”) 3061, entitled “Rebuild broken Audit
Trail due to Missing / Damaged tapes”, was raised by Mr J. Holmes.5° The
purpose of the CP was to reconstruct the Broken Audit Trail using some old
messagestore backup tapes from the NON-Live rig and, subsequently, store the
data in the audit archive.*’ It was highlighted in the CP that, if it was not approved,
Fujitsu would remain contractually non-compliant in the provision of the audit trail
and unable to satisfy PON’s requests for audit data in relation to the relevant

period.5®

CP 3061 was discussed by the Programme Change Control Board (“PCCB”) on

2 and 16 August 2001.59

Following this, CP 3061 was escalated to the Change Control Board (“CCB”) on
20 August 2001.° During the CCB meeting, when asked how the Broken Audit
Trail could be prevented from happening again in future, Mr Hooper informed the
CCB that a read after write mechanism had been introduced to check the data,
but “there was no way to guarantee that this won't happen again”.®' CP 3061
was approved by the CCB on 20 August 2001.° However, it was reverted back

to the PCCB on 18 October 2001 to consider an additional impact.®? On 25

October 2001, the CCB noted the PCCB’s decision to re-target CP 3061 for the

Cl4 S10R release.**

By October 2001, the CS backup tapes had also been recovered from the
relevant Data Centre and held in secure fire-safe storage, pending attempted
retrieval of the data for the relevant period.® In order to reconstitute the audit
data from the CS backup tapes, a pseudo audit server was built which the backup
tapes were to be loaded on to. As a result, by around 7 December 2001, Fujitsu
had reportedly identified that approximately 66% of the missing data for the
relevant period was available on the backup tapes.® The remaining 34% was
not present on the tapes and was deemed irretrievable.®” The gap in the audit
trail was therefore said to have been reduced from a period of 6 days (7 to 14
August 2001) to less than 24 hours (19:27pm on Sunday, 6 August 2000 until

16:09pm on Monday, 7 August 2000).°*

According to a report entitled “Audit Trail Break — Pathway Position” prepared by
Mr Hooper, following identification of the available data on the CS backup tapes,
Fujitsu's recommendation was to rebuild the audit trail using the CS backup tapes
and provide POL with the available data for the period requested in ARQ 8.® In
accordance with the agreed retention periods in place at the time, the data held

on the back up tapes was due to expire on 14 February 2002.”°

By 7 January 2002, Fujitsu had briefed Consignia Internal Audit and Security
Managers on the outcome of the data recovery activities.”’ Consignia confirmed
that the information requested by ARQ 8 was not, at that stage, required in
support of a prosecution. It was agreed that Fujitsu would not need to retrieve
the data from the CS backup tapes at that time but would take steps to ensure

that the data relevant to ARQ 8 was stored and made available if requested.’

Audit of tape handling procedures

52.

53.

Although not solely relevant to the Broken Audit Trail, Fujitsu has disclosed
correspondence relating to an audit that was conducted by Fujitsu, POL and
Consignia of Fujitsu’s management and operation at the Wigan and Bootle Data
Centres. The audit also encompassed Fujitsu’s Belfast Operations Centre,
although Consignia did not participate in the audit visit to Belfast. The report of

this audit does refer to the Broken Audit Trail issue.

In summary, a planned audit into the activities and operation of the Horizon Data
Centres at Wigan and Bootle took place in October 2001 (the “Data Centre
Audit”).’> This also included an audit of the Operations Centre in Belfast, which
was where much of the work carried out in relation to Data Centres was
controlled at that time.” It had been agreed at the Joint Security Audit meeting
on 18 June 2001 that the Data Centre Audit would include tape-handling

procedures and would be observed by a representative from POL, Rashpal

Dhesi (Internal Audit, Consignia and later POL), to verify the tape-handling

procedures in place.”

The Data Centre Audit was carried out by Mr J. Holmes, Mr Hooper, and Mark
Ascot (Test Manager, Fujitsu) from Fujitsu, accompanied at Wigan and Bootle
by Mr Dhesi. Fujitsu’s findings from the Data Centre Audit were recorded in an
internal report entitled “Audit of Horizon Data Centres and Belfast Operations
Centre” dated 21 November 2001 (the “Data Centre Audit Report’).”© This
report set out a number of recommendations for the management of the Data
Centres.”’ A copy of the Data Centre Audit Report was provided to Mr Dhesi on

27 November 2001.78

Mr Dhesi subsequently summarised the Data Centre Audit Report in the format
of a Consignia note (the “Consignia Report”) which he proposed to distribute to
Mike Hannon (Horizon Contract and Commercial Manager, POL), Dave Miller
(Managing Director Post Office Network, POL), Paul Rich (Group Managing
Director, POL), Peter Corbett (Finance Director, POL), Vince Mulholland (Head
of Corporate and Strategic Finance, POL), David Lewington (Head of Group
Internal Audit, POL), and Ernst & Young (External Auditors).’? The Consignia
Report and the extent of its distribution appears to have been a point of
contention at that time. Whilst Fujitsu has not been able to find all relevant

correspondence on this matter, Mr J. Holmes raised various concerns with Mr

Proposals to prevent re-occurrence of the Broken Audit Trail

56. The following measures were put in place by Fujitsu to mitigate the risk of the

Broken Audit Trail re-occurring:

8° FUJ00171983

The “read after write’ mechanism was introduced in September

2001.82

The Audit Panel was reintroduced to PON Internal Audit during June
2001 and expanded to include Security, to allow PON and Fujitsu
security and audit staff to deal with day-to-day issues in an informal

but professional manner.®*

Automated Media Management (to automate tape labelling) was
scheduled to be introduced on 20 August 2001 “to minimise manual

tape intervention” .°4

In June 2001, Fujitsu proposed to introduce write failure checking on
archive tapes in order to provide some assurances that other Legato

tapes were not corrupted.®>

57. Notwithstanding the above-mentioned measures, in a letter dated 7 August 2001,
Mr Lenton-Smith informed Mr Baines that Fujitsu had advised PON Audit and
Security Managers that “the measures to remove altogether the risk of future
tape corruption can be achieved only by a complete re-design of the current

solution” °°

58. Mr Baines responded to this letter on 29 August 2001, raising the following

concerns:*”

a. The “read after write” process only deals with part of the problem — a
more common fault with the media being used by Fujitsu is for the
data to become corrupt after the “write” process. “Normal working
practice we believe is to keep ‘parent’, and ‘grandparent’ copies of

tapes” 88

b. Fujitsu “should have in place a process which alerts POCL of any

failure of their obligation to maintain a full audit traif’ °°

c. Mr Baines also sought confirmation of whether there were any
alternative methods of extracting the data required to assist POL’s

investigations and prosecutions.°°

59. Mr Lenton-Smith sought to respond to these concerns in a letter dated 19

September 2001, in which he confirmed that:%"

a. The purpose of maintaining ‘parent’ and ‘grandparent’ copies of data
is to ensure there is always more than one copy of an archive from
which recovery can be attempted. In fact, two copies of the audit

archive were maintained by Fujitsu (one copy at each Data Centre).

b. In relation to Mr Baines’ request for a process to alert POL of any
failure in the audit trail, Fujitsu was not in a position to know whether
data could not be recovered from either of the two Data Centres until
recovery was attempted. The reason for any delay in notifying POL of
the Broken Audit Trail “was the result of our attempts to recover the
situation without raising undue concern in POCL” and “[t}he
unprecedented circumstances, including a protracted search by TNT

for the lost tape, introduced greater delay’.

c. In relation to alternative methods of extracting the relevant data, Mr
Lenton-Smith wrote that the audit archive “is fully secure, duplicated
across two locations and contains special integrity features to provide
assurances that data written to DLT, and subsequently retrieved, have
not been amended during storage. It is considered the only source
capable of being presented in Court and the only one that Pathway

would be prepared to use in those circumstances’.

Commercial resolution and closure of PinICL PC0066318

60. Issues surrounding the Broken Audit Trail gave rise to correspondence between

POL and Fujitsu regarding alleged contractual breaches.

Page 29 of 103
61.

62.

On 6 February 2002, Mr Baines replied to Mr Lenton-Smith’s 19 September 2001
letter alleging breaches by Fujitsu of “various obligations in the Codified
Agreement...which give rise to the right to terminate, and there is a risk of future
similar defaults because the root causes have not been identified and
corrected’.°* Mr Baines further wrote that “this incident and the issues arising
from lost data represent significant risks to Post Office Limited’s business. It

compromises our ability to assure end to end financial integrity of our business” .°>

Mr Lenton-Smith replied to Mr Baines on 15 February 2002. In this letter, Mr
Lenton-Smith denied that the lost data incident demonstrated “poor
implementation of the audit trail and failure by Fujitsu to exercise appropriate
management control in carrying out the procedures for servicing audit trail
requests. This is the only incident of its kind since provision of this service since
the Summer of 1999.”* Mr Lenton-Smith further wrote that he “cannot accept
that the incident and subsequent developments makes [sic] you believe that
there is a significant risk to your business which in turn makes you question the
fitness of Fujitsu’s infrastructure to deliver financial services’. |n relation to the
remediation steps that had been taken to prevent the Broken Audit Trail from
reoccurring, Mr Lenton-Smith wrote that following the introduction of the “read
after write” checks and tape cloning at both Data Centres, “there are two copies

of all audit data at each centre...All audit DLTs are stored in the Data Centre

computer rooms, in their individual plastic cases, on correct storage racking, in

line with recommendations for long-term storage of DLT media.”°>

Following further correspondence, POL and Fujitsu agreed to settle any claims
regarding possible breaches by Fujitsu of its contractual obligations in return for
a payment of £150,000.%” One of the conditions on which Fujitsu agreed to this
settlement was the approval of CCN 1019 “documenting the necessary changes
to be made to the Codified Agreement in respect of data storage”. PinICL
PC0066318 was closed on 6 November 2002 and CCN 1019 was approved on

21 November 2002.%

OMISSIONS IN ARQ DATA CAUSED BY OPERATOR ERROR

64.

65.

In 2003, it was identified that data had been omitted from ARQ reports provided
in response to three requests (ARQs 198, 199 and 200) relating to the Forest
Gate branch received by Fujitsu on 23 July 2003 (“Forest Gate ARQs”) and one
request (ARQ 320) relating to the Urmston branch received on 1 December 2003

(the “Urmston ARQ’).

In response to the Forest Gate ARQs, ARQ data was provided to POL by
Beatrice Neneh Lowther (IT Security Analyst, Fujitsu) on 29 August 2003.1 In
September 2003, Ms Lowther provided a witness statement relating to the data
provided. Ms Lowther explained that she had “access to reports that monitor

faults, polling failures, equipment failures and calls for advice and guidance

logged by the Horizon System Helpdesk. During the 01 October 2002 to 31
January 2003, there were 13 calls from Forest Gate (FAD 100002) to the
Helpdesk. None of these calls relate to faults which would have had an effect on

the integrity of the information held on the system.”'"'

Ms Lowther also provided an explanation of the process of extracting data in
response to ARQs, including that “fijnformation is presented in exactly the same
way as the data held in the archive although it can be filtered depending upon
the type of information requested’. Ms Lowther further explained that
“Extraction’s [sic] are only made by authorised individuals” and are logged on the

audit workstation and supported by documented ARQs. 102

According to Ms Lowther’s witness statement, she undertook extractions of data
held on the Horizon system on various dates and at various times between 21
August 2003 and 26 August 2003, in response to the Forest Gate ARQs. The

resultant data was copied onto CDs and exhibited to her witness statement.1%

Ms Lowther also extracted data in response to the Urmston ARQ. This was

provided to POL on 8 December 2003.1

On 13 May 2004, Graham Ward (Casework Manager, POL) notified Fujitsu that
Ms Lowther would be required to attend trial in relation to the Forest Gate ARQs
during the week commencing 21 June 2004.'°5 However, as Ms Lowther was on

requested that an alternative witness statement was provided by Penelope Anne
Thomas (IT Security Analyst, Fujitsu). Ms Thomas's witness statement was also
to include “an explanation as to how days were omitted from the original data

supplied” .1°7

Between 13 and 27 May 2004, Ms Thomas re-extracted the relevant ARQ data
in response to the Forest Gate ARQs, copied this to a CD and submitted it to
POL on 27 May 2004.'°° Ms Thomas also provided an accompanying witness
statement, dated 17 June 2004. In this witness statement, Ms Thomas stated
that the CD provided on 27 May 2004 contained “additional transaction data to
that which was originally supplied in August 2003”.'°° In March 2004, Fujitsu
received the following ARQ requests: ARQ 455, 456, 457 458, 459 & 460 of
0304. The requests noted that the witness statement prepared in response to the
request should also “refer to previous data supplied iro. of ARQ’s 320 & 321."11°
Ms Thomas therefore undertook a similar process in relation to the Urmston

ARQ.

Between 25 and 28 May 2004, William Leslie Mitchell (Security manager,
Fujitsu) performed a comparison of the data extracted by Ms Lowther in 2003
and by Ms Thomas in 2004 in response to the ARQ requests received in respect
of the Forest Gate and Urmston branches.''' According to witness statements

later provided by Mr Mitchell, the “recreation of the data and the check was due

to Beatrice Neneh Lowther’s absenc: ind the possibility of a

witness being required to attend a planned court date.” The comparison revealed

a set of omissions in the data provided by Ms Lowther in 2003.112

72. \Inanemail dated 1 June 2004, Mr Mitchell provided Mr Ward with an “update as

to the root cause” of the omissions, as follows:

a.

112 FUJ00121988

ARQs 198 and 200: These requests related to the period 14/10/2002
to 13/11/2002 (totalling 31 query days) and 12/12/2002 to 08/01/2003,
(28 query days) respectively. The root cause for the omission of data
from the August 2003 retrievals was “that the retrieval was executed
as a single task’ resulting in the volume of data retrieved exceeding
the “available limit of the Message Store area on the Audit Server’.
This caused the Audit Server to “randomly drop 11,135 data entries”
in relation to ARQ 198, affecting 10 query days. One query day was

affected by the same issue in relation to ARQ 200.

ARQ 199: This request related to the period 14/11/2002 to 11/12/2002
(28 query days). “The root cause for the omission of data from this
ARQ is when an ARQ is retrieved it is necessary to add additional
days to the end of the requested date span to ensure a full and
complete capture of the data which may have been harvested at
different times. The operator should then confirm that an end of day
log off is present and extract only the required data files. In this case
the operator added two additional days to each ARQ, which is
normally sufficient, but it appears did not confirm that an end of day

log off was present, consequently an additional 235 data entries were

Page 34 of 103

73.

74.

not included in the data extraction. The affected date was 27

November 2002 — Partial, no end of day’.

c. ARQ 320: “[t]he root cause for the omission of data from this ARQ was

the same as ARQ 199 and 200 above”.""°

Mr Mitchell also noted in the 1 June 2004 email that Fujitsu had conducted
checks in relation to a number of other ARQs for 16 other branches “for which

statements have been requested. No discrepancies have been found”.1"4

Mr Mitchell provided a witness statement setting out the above-mentioned
explanations in relation to the Urmston branch (dated 14 June 2004) and the
Forest Gate branch (dated 17 June 2004).''5 In these witness statements, Mr
Mitchell concluded that the omissions made within the data provided by Ms
Lowther had not been repeated in the ARQ data provided by Ms Thomas and

that the latter data was complete in accordance with the original ARQ.""°

2008 INCIDENTS RELATED TO RIPOSTE LOCK EVENT

Peak PC0152376

75.

In or around December 2007, an incident was reported by a Post Office branch
to the Network Business Support Centre (“NBSC”) operated by POL. As
recorded in Peak PC0152376 (“Peak PC0152376”),'"” the call was referred by
the NBSC to Fujitsu. The NBSC informed Katrina Brooks (Helpdesk Support

Technician, Fujitsu) that a “BM stock unit had a gain of £465.73” which “did not

go to local suspense”. When the stock unit rolled over, the local suspense was
cleared and the gain was not accounted for. The value of the gain was shown on
the trading position line on the branch’s trading statement. According to Peak

PC0152376, the trading position line “should always show zero”.118

On 21 December 2007, David Seddon (Technical Support Product Specialist,
Fujitsu) recorded in Peak PC0152376 that the incident was found to have been
caused when two processes were run together: the rollover process on counter
1 and various end of day (“EOD”) processes running in the background. This

caused a timeout, also known as a ‘Riposte lock’ (the “Riposte EOD lock”).1°

On 2 January 2008, Gerald Barnes (Software Developer, Fujitsu) attributed the
Riposte EOD lock to the EPOSS code, describing it as “not resilient to errors”.
Mr Barnes noted that the problem was identified to be caused by a fix made to
the relevant EOD process (known as the “CABSProcess’) as part of a previous
Peak PC0140715,1° which caused CABSProcess to write out messages
‘atomically’."2' As | explain below, the Riposte EOD lock problem could affect
the completeness of ARQ data, which raised potential implications for witness
statements that Fujitsu employees had provided or would provide in relation to
prosecutions brought by POL (the “2008 ARQ Issue”). This problem was found
by the Post Office Account team (the “POA’”) investigating this matter at the time
to have existed in Horizon’s live estate between May 2007 and November

2008.12?

In January 2008, a fix for Peak PC0152376 was proposed; however, as noted in
Peak PC0152376, it was decided that this would not be rolled out “given the rarity
of the problem’.'2° According to an entry by Mr Seddon in Peak PC0152376, the
need for a fix would be reviewed if the problem became more prevalent. In the
meantime, a Known Error Log (“KEL”) was created in relation to the problem
(‘KEL dsed5628Q’).'*4 Mr Barnes provided input on KEL dsed5628Q, noting
that the CABSProcess only ran on “node 1” (i.e. the first counter at the branch),
and postmasters working after 7pm should use any counter other than the first

counter.'25 Peak PC0152376 was closed on 10 January 2008.

Peak PC0152421, a duplicate of Peak PC0152376, records that the branch was
not “out of pocket’ as the recorded loss was written off by POL. Further, a

Business Incident Management System (“BIMS”) report was issued to POL.126

Peaks PC0153009 and PC0152828

80.

Two other Peaks were raised in early 2008 and contain references to
PC0152376. It is unclear whether they relate to the Riposte EOD lock issue but
they have been included in this statement for completeness.'?” Peak PC0153009
was raised in January 2008 and related to a Post Office branch with FAD 226242,
where the postmaster was having difficulty with rolling over. The call was cloned

(i.e., linked) to Peak PC0152828.126

The incident was discussed in an email chain by various members of POA team
members, including Mr Barnes, Michael Peach (Software Support Centre
(“SSC”) Manager, Fujitsu) and Steve Parker (SSC Support Manager, Fujitsu).'2°
Mr Barnes, who was assigned to the Peak, described the problem as the branch
being unable to rollover a stock unit. Mr Barnes analysed the problem and found
that it had been caused by one corrupt transaction. Mr Barnes proposed a
general fix so that DataServer could correct corrupt transactions, though he
noted that the frequency of the problem’s occurrence would dictate whether the
fix would be required’®°. Mr Barnes also recorded on the Peak that he was “not
sure it is worth spending time improving the EPOSS version which is shortly to
be replaced; it would be better spending the same effort making the HNGX
version better. | had already requested that this be advised to the HNGX team in

PC0152376’.

As noted in Peak PC0152376, in this instance, Mr Barnes corrected the corrupt
transaction at the affected branch by running a patched DataServer, and the
Peak was closed later that month once the affected branch confirmed that they

had rolled over successfully.'%"

Peak PC0155120

Peak PC0155120 was opened on 6 March 2008 after the NBSC informed Fujitsu
that a Post Office branch with FAD 485611 had reported that the default stock

unit (which usually rolled over automatically) had failed to roll over."3? Peak

PC0155120 included a reference to KEL dsed5628Q and stated that it appeared
the problem related to “a rare timing issue” where a software process ran at the
same time as rolling over.'%* An Operational Change Request (“OCR”) was
approved by Fujitsu to correct the problem and the Peak was subsequently
closed.'** KEL kiangl823S was raised on 6 March 2008, which recorded the

incident as effectively being “a specific instance of KEL dsed5628Q”.'%

Incident at the Craigpark branch (PC0158102)

84.

85.

In or around July 2008, it appears that there was an issue relating to a
discrepancy at the Craigpark branch with FAD 141832. The issue was discussed
at a Product & Branch Accounting workshop attended by POL and Fujitsu on
1 August 2008.'%° According to the “Actions” report from this meeting, Mike
Stewart (Service Delivery Manager for On Line Services, Fujitsu) noted that a fix
could be introduced, but “what is being proposed for the bug fix [...] if it were to
go wrong could impact the whole estate so avoiding such a fix sounds like the
correct decision”. It appears from the Actions report that an associated BIMS

report was issued to POL.

On the same day, 1 August 2008, Anne Chambers (SSC Systems Support
Specialist, Fujitsu) emailed Gareth Jenkins (Distinguished Engineer, Fujitsu) and
Mr Stewart regarding the incident at the Craigpark branch.'%” In her email, Mrs
Chambers explained that the incident caused a Riposte lock and that it had

occurred once before at the same branch, but did not affect the branch balance

on the earlier occasion. Mrs Chambers noted the underlying problem was known,
citing Peak PC0152376. Mrs Chambers further explained that while there was a
fix available, “given the low incidence of problems (and the errors introduced on
the back of other fixes) it was decided not to implement’. However, Mrs
Chambers suggested that “since [they] have no way of monitoring for it, and
[receipts & payments] mismatches may not be reported by the [sub-postmaster],

this decision should be reviewed" .1°8

Mr Jenkins responded to Mrs Chambers on 4 August 2008 noting that he
understood similar incidents would be flagged to Fujitsu through various
processes, including generating a ‘red event’.°° Mr Jenkins suggested it might
be more practical for Fujitsu to carry out weekly manual checks for the issue, and
that this “would be significantly less risky than a bug fix given the low number of
occurrences.” In particular, Mr Jenkins noted that he understood “what is being
proposed for the bug fix and if it were to go wrong [it] could impact the whole
estate so avoiding a fix sounds like the correct decision”. However, given
discussions that had taken place on 1 August 2008, Mr Jenkins explained that
“we need to be able to re-assure POL that we would spot any further occurrences
and have a mechanism to correct the accounts (if necessary) even if we don't fix

the root cause”.'40

In a separate email chain, on 11 August 2008, Mr Jenkins notified Peter Sewell
(Security Operations Manager, Fujitsu) of the issue at the Craigpark branch,

stating “Given we only have a couple of instances, and a fix is as likely to cause

further problems, then we're reluctant to make a change to Horizon. However, if
Horizon data is being used in evidence for the prosecution of a Postmaster, it is
probably wise to check to see if any such events were produced during the period

in question. Is this something that can / should be built into the ARQ process?’."41

It appears that a meeting took place on 13 August 2008 attended by Mr Jenkins,
Mr Sewell, Alan Holmes (Technical Design Authority, Fujitsu), Steven Meek
(System Developer, Fujitsu) and Penelope Thomas (Security Analyst, Customer
Services, Fujitsu) “to discuss the issue of errors produced by [R]iposte [...] in
relation to the validity and integrity of data provided to [POL] under the ARQ
agreement.” Ms Thomas prepared a note of the meeting dated 14 August 2008

(‘13 August Meeting Note”).'42

According to the 13 August Meeting Note’, Mr Jenkins explained the issue as
follows: “An EOD process (CABSProcess) was being run between 1900 and
2000 hours, and at the same time the user was performing a balancing process
on the gateway PC. During the EOD operation the CABSProcess created a ‘lock’
on the messagestore during which time (30 seconds) causing any other message
writes to wait, subject to a 10 second timeout, until the lock was released. The
balancing operation attempted to write messages to the messagestore but this
operation timed out and the messages were discarded. Due to a deficiency in
the implementation of the counter code the end user was not informed of the
failure and the transaction (the balancing operation) appeared to complete

successfully. When this type of error happens Riposte records an event to the

event log. It was said that this type of error could happen with any type of

transaction.”

The 13 August Meeting Note recorded, inter alia, (i) a set of follow-up actions
that were agreed during the meeting to understand the types of transactions that
were subject to the 2008 ARQ Issue, and (ii) that Fujitsu “cannot provide any
further ARQs until this exercise is complete as the audit server is being fully
utilised retrieving the 5.5 years worth of Event log data. We must question
whether it is advisable to provide further ARQ data or witness statements until
we have a process in place to fully validate our returns. It was agreed that the
process of retrieving all of the available Event logs would be carried out and this

would start immediately.”'4+

On 22 August 2008, Mr Stewart emailed Mr Jenkins and Mrs Chambers providing
an update on his interactions with Shaun White (Branch Systems IT Advisor,
POL) regarding the incident. In his email, Mr Stewart noted that Mr White was
seeking further clarification of the causes of the Riposte EOD lock event at
Craigpark to pass onto the POL Fraud team. On the same day, Mr Jenkins
replied to Mr Stewart and noted that he and Roy Birkinshaw (Software and
Solutions Development Manager, Fujitsu) would provide an update to Mr Stewart

and Mrs Chambers in terms of communicating with POL.'45

On 28 August 2008, Mr Birkinshaw circulated to Mr Jenkins and David Johns
(Operations Manager, Fujitsu) a draft description of the Riposte EOD lock issue,

which was purportedly targeted at the “initial goal of defining the problem for

R&RMG management’ and it was not intended for Post Office in its initial draft
form.'4° The document noted the following: “/f the counter were to mis-handle a
financial transaction, whilst simultaneously failing to write to the Riposte
Message Store, this could have potentially serious implications on the integrity

of the audit information supplied to Post Office.”

On or around 3 September 2008, members of POA, including Mr Jenkins, Mrs
Chambers, Mr Stewart and Mr Peach prepared an explanation of the incident at
the Craigpark branch as requested by Mr White.’4” The agreed draft explanation
included the following: “We have identified two occurrences of this event in the
last 2 years which have resulted in an accounting problem and the rest appear
to be benign or had a minor effect which did not impact the branch accounts...We
have a possible mitigation for the timing problem which has been identified.
However, since there had only been 2 occurrences of the accounting problem in
two years, it had been the decision of the Release Management Forum that the
cost of implementing the mitigation would outweigh the potential benefit. This
decision will be reviewed in the light of recent evidence as part of the normal

process”.

Investigation and remediation of the 2008 ARQ Issue

Fixing the Riposte EOD lock problem

94.

By reference to various email correspondence, during September 2008, it

appears it was decided that a fix should be issued in relation to the underlying

software bug relating to the Riposte EOD lock.'#8 Mr Barnes, Mr Birkinshaw, John
Burton (Programme Manager, Fujitsu), Mrs Chambers, Steve Evans (Systems
Integration Team Leader, Fujitsu), Mr Jenkins, Mr Peach and Mr Seddon appear
to have been involved in the decision and/or subsequent work that was
undertaken to develop, prepare, test, and release a software code fix to the live

estate (which was operating Legacy Horizon at the relevant time)."4°

As noted at paragraphs 75 to 79 of this statement, the Riposte EOD lock appears
to have been first recorded in Peak PC0152376. Due to administrative reasons,
however, related Peak PC0164429 was used as a means of delivering the

software code fix.'5°

As the software code fix involved changes to Horizon’s live estate, the creation
and implementation of the fix was decided as part of the release management

process, and authorisation to release the fix was given on 29 September 2008."51

As noted in the relevant Release Note’®?, in or around October 2008, the
software code fix was tested, and the fix was delivered to the Horizon live estate

via release “T86” (Release number reference RNT8601).1°>

Review of the audit mechanism

98.

In September 2008, the POA conducted a “review of the audit mechanism and

of the Horizon counter’s behaviour (see, for example, FUJ00155253 and

148 FUJ00155396

FUJ00155257)."*4 The review involved Peter Ambrose (Technical Manager,
Fujitsu), Mr Birkinshaw, Mr Burton, Mrs Chambers, Andrew Dunks (Information
Technology Security Analyst, Fujitsu), Mr Evans, Mr A. Holmes, Mr Jenkins, Mr
Johns, Mr Meek, Mr Sewell and Ms Thomas. The review appears to have
involved (i) an analysis of some of the branches and counters with high incidents
of the Riposte EOD lock problem, (ii) identifying, inter alia, where the problems
associated with the Riposte EOD lock did and did not occur, and (iii) the SSC
checking ARQs to determine whether the Riposte EOD lock had resulted in any
financial or operational impact on the branch for the time period relating to the
ARQ.*55 A working paper, titled “Analysis of Audit timeouts” appears to have been

prepared as a result of the work undertaken as part of the review. ©

In an email from Mrs Chambers to Ms Thomas dated 16 September 2008, Mrs
Chambers explained that the Riposte EOD lock event would occur when one
process had ‘locked’ the Riposte messagestore and another process tried to
access the messagestore at the same time.'5”? The CABSProcess, which would
run at 7.00pm during the EOD procedures at the branch, was the “worst offender”
for causing ‘locking’ to occur; however, event locks could occur in other ways.'®°
Whether or not the Riposte EOD lock event could cause a financial or operational
impact depended on what the second process was attempting to do, and whether
the process handled the error situation appropriately.°° Therefore, Mrs

Chambers checked the ARQs provided by Ms Thomas to (i) identify the two

processes involved, and (ii) assess whether the second process “could
conceivably have failed to handle the situation, and if so would it have any
financial or operational impact.” \t also appears that subsequent investigations
into the Riposte EOD lock found that the “atomic transaction” that caused the

CABSProcess to lock was not attempted in any other part of the EPOSS code."

The change proposal for HNG-X

100. In or around October 2008, a change proposal was prepared in relation to HNG-

101.

X, which proposed the creation of an automated solution in HNG-X for the
Riposte event log checks that were undertaken manually when ARQ requests
were made by POL."® It is understood that these manual checks of the Riposte
event log were introduced as a result of the 2008 ARQ Issue. The change
proposal was titled “Enable analysis of Horizon Counter event messages within
the HNG-X Audit solution’, and it was later given the reference number CP0336
(also referred to as CP4867) (“CP0336”). CP0336 was also referred to as the
“Counter Audit Change Proposal” or “Audit Strengthening Change Proposal”.
CP0336 was approved and implemented in or around July 2009, which is

explained further at paragraph 116 of this statement.

CP0336 noted the “current horizon tactical solution” for retrieving archived data
to respond to ARQ requests from POL was largely a manual process which was
“error prone & time consuming”, and that it required “local & insecure storage of
event audit data, invalidating certain standards made within the current witness

statement’.'® It appears, CP0336 proposed a more automated solution be

implemented in the HNG-X audit server and workstation applications to
automatically retrieve and filter Horizon counter event log data when performing
data retrievals in relation to branches operating Legacy Horizon or HNG-X. At
the time, it also appears that those individuals involved in CP0336 considered
that it was impracticable to introduce this change into the Legacy Horizon audit

server given it was being replaced by HNG-X.'®?

CP0336 cited Peak PC0152376 as an example of the potential for the audit trail
to contain instances of event messages which, in the event of an ARQ retrieval,
needed to be analysed to understand if they were significant or not. CP0336

introduced a change in HNG-X’s audit retrieval tooling.

The changes proposed in CP0336 in relation to the audit system included
amending the audit server and workstation applications to automatically retrieve
and filter event data when performing branch data retrievals (i.e. ARQs) in

relation to branches operating Legacy Horizon and HNG-X.164

Mr Birkinshaw, Mr A. Holmes, Mr Evans, Mr Jenkins, Mr Meek, Howard Pritchard
(Principal Security Consultant, Fujitsu), Mr Sewell and Ms Thomas were involved
in the initial drafting and/or discussions in relation to CP0336 (see, for example,

FUJ00155271, FUJ00155278, FUJ00155373 and FUJ00155380).1°

statements provided by Fujitsu to POL as part of the prosecution support
service.'® It appears the persons involved in the initial drafting and discussions
regarding CP0336 (noted above at paragraph 104) agreed that the proposed
changes to the event checking process needed to be implemented.'®” As a result,
in December 2008, a PowerPoint presentation was prepared titled “Prosecution
Support Urgent Issue” (“December 2008 Presentation”)'®, which appears to

have been prepared in order to:

a. _ internally escalate the 2008 ARQ Issue and the concerns regarding
the completeness of the transaction data on Horizon’s audit archive
that was being provided to POL as part of Fujitsu's prosecution

support service (i.e. as part of the ARQ process); and

b. support the sponsorship within Fujitsu of budget to fund the

developments summarised in CP0336.

It appears Ms Thomas prepared the December 2008 Presentation. Graham Allen
(Application Development Manager, Fujitsu), Adam Cousins (Application
Development Manager, Fujitsu), Mr Evans, David Hinde (Project Manager,
Fujitsu), Mr A. Holmes, Mr Jenkins, Mr Pritchard and Mr Sewell also appear to
have been involved or otherwise had sight of the December 2008 Presentation

December 2008.'7° Mr Denham attended the meeting on behalf of Wendy
Warham (Operations Director, Royal Mail Group Account, Fujitsu).'71 Other
attendees of the meeting appear to have included Mr Allen, Mr Cousins, Mr

Evans, Mr A. Holmes, Mr Pritchard and Mr Sewell. 172

Following the meeting, it appears Mr Denham was going to speak with “Legal”
about the 2008 ARQ Issue’”’; however, to date, Fujitsu has not identified any
documents or records as to whether Mr Denham contacted Fujitsu’s in-house

legal team or external legal advisors, and if so, what was discussed.

In January 2009, the POA team prepared a revised draft of the “standard witness
statement’ that Fujitsu provided POL in relation to ARQ data. This contained
proposed amendments in relation to the 2008 ARQ Issue (“Proposed Witness
Statement”) (see, for example, FUJ00122592, FUJ00122593, FUJ00122596
and FUJ00122597).'74 Mr Allen, Mrs Chambers, Mr Denham, Mr Evans, Mr A.
Holmes, Mr Jenkins and Ms Thomas were primarily involved in drafting or
reviewing the proposed amendments, which included adding (i) an explanation

of the event checking process, and (ii) a description of the 2008 ARQ Issue.

Fujitsu’s notification to POL

110.

On 7 January 2009, Ms Warham notified Sue Lowther (Head of Information
Security, POL) and David Gray (Chief Technical Architect, POL) about the 2008

ARQ Issue via email'’5. In the email, Ms Warham provided a summary of the

2008 ARQ Issue in similar terms to the description provided in the Proposed

Witness Statement, and set out various steps that should be taken by Fujitsu and

POL to address the issue, including:

a.

checking the ARQs and confirming the data integrity in the period May

2007 to November 2008;

discussing and agreeing on how they disclose the 2008 ARQ Issue in

the witness statements provided by Fujitsu to POL;

identifying witness statements Fujitsu had previously supplied and
were still awaiting a court appearance to (i) confirm whether they were
impacted by the 2008 ARQ Issue, and (ii) recall and replace impacted

witness statements;

automating the messagestore alerts on the Horizon system so that
manual intervention was not required, with apparent reference to

CP0336; and

providing education to ensure that these types of incidents were
raised as a major incident so that the communication and
management of the incident was undertaken within relevant

timescales.

111. On 7 January 2009, Ms Thomas forwarded Ms Warham’s email to Dave Posnett

(Casework Manager, Investigation Team, POL), attaching the Proposed Witness

Statement.’’® Later that day, Mr Posnett emailed Ms Thomas, forwarding an

email exchange between Mr Posnett and Rob Wilson (Head of Criminal Law
Team, POL) regarding the 2008 ARQ Issue.'”” Referring Ms Thomas to his email
exchange with Mr Wilson, Mr Posnett stated: “/ would say Business As Usual re
witness statements ie don’t include the two additional paragraphs on the last
page. If any issues materialize in due course, we can address then - suggest the

ARQs for these 4 cases are assessed first.”

On 8 January 2009, Ms Thomas forwarded Mr Posnett’s email of 7 January 2009
to Ms Warham and Mr Denham (copying Mr Pritchard and Mr Sewell).178
Referring the email recipients to Mr Posnett’s email, Ms Thomas noted that “POL
clearly do not want the specific details of this incident included in the witness
statement. | will hold off providing the 4 outstanding statements until our review

is complete.”

On 8 January 2009, it appears that relevant members of the POA also held a
meeting where it was decided that POA would conduct a review to identify ARQs
that may have been affected by the 2008 ARQ Issue (see, for example,
FUJ00155402 and FUJ00155400).'79 Mr Allen, Mr Barnes, Mrs Chambers, Mr
Denham, Mr Evans, Mr A. Holmes, Mr Peach, Mr Pritchard, Ms Thomas and Ms
Warham were primarily involved in this review, which included the following

steps:

a. Fujitsu's audit team compared a list of ARQs prepared by the Security
team with relevant event data limited to events occurring between 1

May 2007 and 30 November 2008 that were logged between 7pm and

WITN06650300
7.10pm, which were logged by counter one at the relevant branch'®.
As a result of this work, 27 instances of the 2008 ARQ Issue were

identified'®!; and

the SSC then undertook further checks in relation to these 27
instances to confirm whether the Riposte EOD lock had impacted the
transactions or balancing carried out by the Post Office branch. To
undertake these checks, the SSC reviewed the SSC event archives,
Riposte messagestores, and Riposte event/transaction logs (where
these were available).'®? Following these checks, it appears the SSC
concluded none of the 27 instances of the 2008 ARQ Issue identified
by the audit team had impacted the transactions or balancing carried

out at the relevant branches.'®°

Fujitsu's checks in relation to the ARQs for the period 1 May 2007 to
30 November 2008 had been completed, which involved checking the

event logs in relation to 195 ARQs that fell within this timeframe;

27 instances of concern had been identified, which had been fully

analysed, and Fujitsu could confirm the locking issue had been

c. following the analysis of the 27 instances of concern, no transactions
or balancing activities carried out at the relevant branches had been

found to have been affected;

d. a change proposal had been raised to “automate the event checking

process”, which appears to be a reference to CP0336; and

e. _ the “standard witness statement’ had been reviewed and no reference
had been made to the “/ocking issue”, but minor revisions had been

made. 85

115. Mr Denham, Mr Pritchard and Mr Sewell were involved in drafting or otherwise

The implementation of CP0336

116. CP0336, which is described at paragraphs 104 to 108 above, was finalised and
passed in March 2009. Mr Denham, Mr Hinde, Mr A. Holmes, Mr Sewell, Ms
Warham and Guy Wilkerson (Commercial Director, Royal Mail Group Account,
Fujitsu) appear to have been primarily involved in the preparation and approval
of CP0336, which was raised on or around 26 February 2009 and approved

internally by Fujitsu on or around 31 March 2009"8’. The changes referred to in

DUPLICATE TRANSACTIONS

The Inquiry has asked for details of the Duplicate Transactions incident, first
identified in 2010. | also address apparent known recurrences of the incident in

2014 and 2016.

2010 Incident

118.

119.

On 21 June 2010, Penny Thomas (Security Analyst, Fujitsu) raised Peak
PC0200468 ‘Horizon Audit Spreadsheet Producing Duplicate Transactions’ as
an ‘A priority’, as she had identified duplicate transaction records in an ARQ
return during an audit retrieval for branch 072128.'°° The Peak was assigned to

Gerald Barnes (Software Engineer, Fujitsu).

On 23 June 2010, Ms Thomas shared an initial report on the Peak with Graham
Welsh (Application Services, Post Office Account, Fujitsu), Gaetan Van Achte
(Service Director, Royal Mail Group Account, Fujitsu), Donna Munro (Security
Operations Manager, Fujitsu), Peter Thompson (Head of Service Operations and
Applications, Fujitsu), Gareth Jenkins (Applications Architect, Fujitsu) and Alan
Holmes (Service Delivery Manager, Fujitsu).197 The report noted that under

Legacy Horizon, duplicate records were held in the source Transaction

Management Service (“TMS’) file on the Audit server under “what was thought
to be ‘exceptional circumstances”;"9? when the Audit application was in use,
Riposte would not record duplicate messages in the reconstructed message
store, and so transactions were not duplicated on the ARQ returns. However, the
HNG-X application did not identify or discard duplicated records, resulting in the

problem of duplicate transactions appearing in ARQ returns (Peak PC0200468).

Ms Thomas’ report further stated that an analysis conducted the day before (22
June 2010) had identified that one third of ARQ returns generated under the

HNG-X application had duplicate transactions.'%°

Ms Thomas’ report recorded that a discussion had taken place between Mr A.
Holmes, Mr Jenkins and Ms Thomas. The various actions agreed during that

discussion were:

a. Toreport Peaks PC0200468 and PC0194639 (see paragraph 123) to
Pat Lywood (Service Implementation Manager, Fujitsu) “to be

identified in CS Prayers as urgent’ .1%4

b. As an interim measure, to incorporate the unique identifier NUM in
ARQs to identify duplicate transactions / unique sequence

numbers. 195

c. Mr Jenkins was to draft a statement for management review detailing

the issue for transmission to POL.'%°

A separate issue was identified whereby a duplicated transaction had

a different ‘NUM’, which Mr Jenkins agreed to review. '*” With respect

to this particular issue:

(i)

(ii)

In an email of 23 June 2010, Mr Jenkins wrote to Ms
Thomas and Mr A. Holmes, “/’ve had a look at the Mails
duplicate. | think it is OK. I’ve sent the extract to Richard
O'Neil in Crew to confirm that this is normal.”'% In a
summary of the duplicate transaction issue he wrote “we
have identified scenarios with Postal services transactions
where (details tbs) which result in different transactions

appearing to be duplicates”.'°°

On 24 June 2010, Mr Jenkins emailed both again, “!’ve
now confirmed that the Mails duplicate is OK’ and

amended the summary of the duplicate transaction issue:

“we have identified a scenario with Post Services
transactions where multiple, identical mails items are
accepted (ie the Quantity button is set to greater than 1),
but Postage Labels are printed for each individual item.
This results in separate transactions being generated for
each item, which are identical in the ARQ extracts (there is

another minor different [sic] in the raw data apart from the

Page 56 of 103

WITN06650300
WITN06650300
<Num< attribute, but this different attribute is not currently

included in the ARQ extract)”.?°°

122. The report also noted the need to identify the cases which had progressed to
prosecution since HNG-X had been live, and whether duplicate records had been
included in support evidence. The report references an initial review in which

West Byfleet (R v Misra) and Porters Avenue (R v Hosi) had been identified.2°"

123. In an internal Fujitsu email chain on 23 June 2010, Ms Thomas reported Peak
PC0200468 to Ms Lywood. In her email, Ms Thomas noted that the problem
recorded in Peak PC200468 was a “very significant problem”, and that “In a nut
shell the HNG-X application is not removing duplicate transactions (which may
have been recorded twice on the Audit Server) and they are appearing in the
AR@Q returns”.*°? She also noted that the steps taken following a previous Peak
(PC0194639) were supposed to highlight any duplication of records, but this did

not appear to be happening.?°2

124. Peak PC0194639 had been raised on 16 February 2010 by Andrew Mansfield
(Audit Development, Fujitsu) as there had “been cases recently of HNG-X
messages appearing in the audit files with duplicate JSNs (Journal Sequence
Numbers — message numbers)’ as a result of “an issue with the counter software”
but not being reported clearly to the audit client user. A fix was attributed to

the Peak “to highlight any problem with duplicate message numbers and make it

obvious to the user’.2°5 On 14 June 2010, the same fix was attributed to the Peak
again. Documents relating to the underlying issue in Peak PC01946339 (i.e., the
duplicate JSN issue) have been separately disclosed to the Inquiry.2°° Copied in
this email chain, Graham Allen (Applications Engineering Manager, Fujitsu)
asked Mr A. Holmes, Adam Spurgeon (Data Centre Development Manager,
Fujitsu), and Mr Mansfield whether there were fixes for the Peaks, and if not, how
long it would be before they would be ready.°” With respect to Peak PC0200468,
Mr Mansfield responded that Mr Barnes had started testing a fix to remove the
duplicated messages from the Horizon transaction data.?°° With respect to Peak
PC0194639, he noted that the Peak was less serious as the purpose of the Peak
was to clearly highlight where duplicates had been found.”° A fix would take two

to three days and would require a change to workstation applications only.

125. On 24 June 2010, Ms Thomas updated various members of the Fujitsu team
working on this issue with a more detailed analysis of the ARQs that had been

affected by email. This analysis stated that:
a. 112 ARQs had been affected;

b. 17 ARQs highlighted one or two instances which indicated bona fide

activity;

c. 7 ARQs were works in progress;

d. 12 ARQs had been involved in two court cases;

e. 8 ARQs had been involved in three court cases where witness

statements had been requested by POL, but not yet provided; and

f. Court activity was not known in relation to 76 ARQs.?'°

In the same email, Ms Thomas also provided an explanation of the problem and
suggested a workaround that had been drafted by Mr Jenkins for POL.2‘' Mr
Welsh responded that he saw no issue with the content of the report and was

pleased to have a workaround.?'2

Guy Wilkerson (Commercial Director, Fujitsu) responded by asking whether the
duplicated transactions would affect charges against Sub-Postmasters,*"? and
Mr Jenkins advised that “any detailed analysis of the finances of a Branch which
is done with duplicate transactions without realising that there are duplicates (and
so removing them) will give incorrect results” (including analysis of stock units,
cash on hand analysis and possibly the sum of all transactions).2"4 Mr Wilkerson
recommended that Alan D’Alvarez (Programme Director, Fujitsu) or Geoff Butts
(HNG-X Release 1 Programme Manager, Fujitsu) of the HNG-X team look at the
issue, and agreed with Ms Thomas that she should “hold off’ advising her
counterpart at POL of the issue “just until [they] get a chance to speak the HNG-

X team tomorrow”. 216

After Ms Thomas confirmed to Mr Butts and Mr Wilkerson that she would not
communicate with POL regarding the issue, she expressed her assumption that
any duplicate records presented to court would need to be replaced.2'* Attached
to her email was a list of ARQs and witness statements, highlighting the then
ongoing cases relating to Porters Avenue (R. v Hosi) and West Byfleet (R. v
Misra).2'7 Additional Post Office branches (High Wycombe, Kirkoswald, New
Cheltenham, Castleton, Rinkfield, Shefford and Wokingham) were highlighted

green with the note: “1 or 2 instances which indicates bone fide activity’ .2"*

Mr Welsh forwarded Ms Thomas’ email to Ms Lywood describing the problem to
a wider Fujitsu team (including Mr D’Alvarez, Mr Allen, Mr Van Achte, Mr Butts,
Mr Thompson, Mark Andrews (Account Manager, Fujitsu), Vince Cochrane
(Head of Infrastructure and Migration, Royal Mail Group Account, Fujitsu), James
Davidson (Operations Executive, Fujitsu), and Debbie Richardson (Programme
Test Manager, Post Office Account, Fujitsu)).2"* Mr Welsh wrote of the problem,
“duplicate records that can not [sic] be differentiated are supplied as evidence.
Thus could allow for legal challenge to the integrity of the system”.?2° Mr Allen
copied Mr Jenkins into the email chain as he had “identified a workaround’ .22'
Mr Jenkins responded that he was not sure whether the workaround would be

acceptable to POL prior to review by the HNG-X team.?22

Mr Wilkerson forwarded the email exchanges on the issue to Peter Beresford

(Sourcing Manager, Fujitsu) (also on 25 June 2010), stating, “/ don’t want to be

telling POL that they can’t rely on Branch numbers or that there’s a risk of more
complaints from Post masters. They could regard this as a serious issue and
delay acceptance on HNG-X. Geoff Butts tells me he’s aware and that they are
working on a permanent fix.”23 Mr Butts forwarded this to David Cooke (Service
Level Manager, Fujitsu) (with Mr Andrews, Mr Allen, Mr Welsh and Mr Jenkins in
copy) warning, “this may become an Acceptance Incident’ and explaining that
Mr Jenkins was assessing the viability of the workaround but there was no
capacity to include a fix within HNG-X Release 1.274 Mr Jenkins confirmed that
the workaround would require Fujitsu to inform POL of the problem and “since
this does relate to evidence used for prosecutions, [...] now we know there is an

issue we do need to tell POL about it asap.”2

On 30 June 2010, Ms Thomas emailed Sue Lowther (Head of Information
Security, POL), Mark Dinsdale (Security Programme Manager, POL) and Jane
Owen (Security Team Advisor, POL) informing them of the duplicate transaction
records problem.22° She explained that with the upgrade from Legacy Horizon
to HNG-X, the HNG-X data retrieval mechanism did not remove duplicated data
in the ARQ extracts and, from a review of the ARQs provided to POL since the
change to HNG-X, it had been indicated that approximately 35% of the ARQs

might contain some duplicate data.22”

Following a call with Mr Dinsdale, Ms Owen and Alan Simpson (Information

Security Incident Senior, POL) on 2 July 2010, Ms Thomas forwarded notes of

the call to the Fujitsu team (Tom Lillywhite (Principal Security Consultant,
Fujitsu), Ms Munro, Mr Thompson, Mr Welsh and Mr Jenkins).?28 The notes of
the call confirmed that affected ARQs were used in the Porters Avenue and West
Byfleet cases (R. v Hosi and R. v Misra).?29 The notes state that ARQs had been
provided to the defence expert in the cases, but there was uncertainty about
whether the ARQs had been presented to the Court already, which may have

necessitated the provision of replacement data.?°

On 1 July 2010, Mr Allen followed up with Mr Mansfield regarding the fix for Peak
PC0200468.781 The Peak was with the Release Management Forum for
approval and scheduling, as it was reported that Mr Barnes had produced a fix
for HNG-X Release 1 which was ready to go.?°* He had added an impact
statement to the Peak, including a brief statement on testing.?°> Mr Mansfield
further noted that a possible workaround, being discussed by Ms Thomas and
POL, involved “modifying the audit queries so that the message numbers are
included in the output to the spreadsheets (currently they are not). This would
allow the duplicate messages to be identified and removed by running a macro

on the final spreadsheet generated by the application. "25+

Ms Thomas asked Mr Welsh for his help with Peak PC0200468 on 5 July 2010
as “POL have gone to POL legal for guidance and further returns have been

identified this morning as bound for Court.”235 Mr Welsh forwarded this request

to Mr Butts and Sheila Bamber (Release Manager, Fujitsu) (copying Mr
Lillywhite) asking for confirmation as to when the fix could be fitted, as “there are
more court cases pending and whilst the Briefing to the Investigation has taken
place they are coming back requesting help due to the level of activity and
nervousness regarding the current work-a-round.”*°° Ms Bamber responded that
it would take three days’ work to take the fix with HNG-X Release 2.257. Mr
Mansfield confirmed that Mr Barnes could merge the fix into the HNG-X Release
2 code and deliver the fix by 7 July 2010.298 Chris Hammond (Major Release
Manager, Fujitsu) confirmed this would be deployed on 10 July 2010 with all other
HNG-X Request 2 baselines.”°9 On 7 July 2010, Mr Barnes emailed a wider
Fujitsu team (Ms Bamber, Mr A. Holmes, Mr Mansfield, Mr Spurgeon, Peter
Okely (Application Services, Fujitsu), Vijesh Pandya (Integration Team Leader,
Fujitsu), Matthew Swain (Integration Team, Post Office Account, Fujitsu) and
Nigel Taylor (Integration Team, Fujitsu)) stating that an Audit baseline for Peak

PC0200468 was ready for build.”4°

135. On 7 July 2010, FSL and POL agreed to amend the standard FSL witness
statement (the “Amended Standard Witness Statement’) that accompanied
ARQ data to include the wording: “the duplication of audited records has not, in
any way, affected actual physical transactions recorded on any counter at any
outlet. The duplication of records has occurred during the auditing process when
records were in the process of being recorded purely for audit purposes from the
correspondence servers to the audit servers. It should be noted that this

137.

duplication of data in the audit stream has always been happening. However the
Horizon retrieval process automatically discarded duplicate records before
creating the ARQ spreadsheets, while the current HNG-X retrieval process for

Horizon data does not do so”.2*1

Ms Thomas and Mr Jenkins reviewed this updated language and shared it with
Mr Lillywhite and Mr Wilkerson.242, POL had also suggested that Mr Jenkins
complete the witness statement as the Fujitsu expert witness, to which Ms
Thomas commented that this would not fit into the current service agreement and
it would not be feasible for him to provide all witness statements going ahead.”4?
Attached to her email was a standard witness statement including the modified
wording regarding duplicate transactions,”44 which had previously been reviewed

by Mr Jenkins.245

In the 7 July 2010 email correspondence, POL also requested that Fujitsu
“provide a witness statement to quantity the above that [they] could attach to
each case (as appropriate), and treat each case where this is not accepted
individually’ .24° On 8 July 2010, Ms Thomas informed Mr Jenkins that she and
Mr Wilkerson had discussed an “additional statement regarding duplicate
records”.247 Mr Wilkerson had initially suggested that Ms Thomas include the
following statement in her witness statement: “The Audit Mechanism cannot alter
the base information and therefore a re-running of the audit process will always

produce the same result’, which she incorporated in an updated pro forma

witness statement.*4® However, Ms Thomas noted to Mr Jenkins that that Mr
Wilkerson was of the view that “if [POL] wanted an expert witness statement we
should provide [sic]”. In addition, Mr Wilkerson had “said that a CR would need
to be raised by POL but when he realised it would only be for a short while and
that we needed one pretty soon for Kirkoswald he thought] we could provide this
FOC."*49 Ms Thomas explained that if Mr Jenkins was happy to provide such a
statement (the "Draft Additional Duplicate Transactions Witness
Statement"), she would remove the extract Mr Wilkerson had proposed from the

standard statement.?5°

138. In addition to various drafting notes, the Amended Standard Witness Statement
included the below wording, which explains that HNG-X did not de-duplicate

records in ARQ extracts as Legacy Horizon had:?*":

"With Horizon counters, the mechanism by which Data is audited has always
worked on the principle that it is acceptable to audit the same data more than
once — in particular if in doubt as to whether or not it has been previously audited
successfully. The Mechanism used on Horizon to retrieve the audit data took
this into account and only presented one instance of such duplicate data in the
ARQ extracts. The Audit Mechanism cannot alter the base information and

therefore a re-running of the audit process will always produce the same result.

In January 2010 a new HNG-X application was introduced to filter transaction

records for presentation to Post Office Limited. It has recently been noticed that

this HNG-X retrieval mechanism does not remove such duplicates. An
enhancement to the extraction toolset will be developed, tested and deployed
and will remove such duplicate data in the future. However until this
enhancement is deployed, there is a possibility that data is duplicated. The
reliable way to identify a duplicate transaction is to use the <Num> attribute that
is used to generate the unique sequence numbers. This will be included in all
future transaction record returns until the retrieval mechanism is enhanced. A
semi-automated process to copy the returned data, and then to identify and
remove any duplicated records which may be present from this copy by using
the <NUM> attribute, has been agreed with Post Office Limited for use in the
interim period. It is emphasised that the duplication of audited records has not,
in any way, affected actual physical transactions recorded on any counter at
any outlet. The duplication of records has occurred during the auditing process
when records were in the process of being recorded purely for audit purposes

from the correspondence servers to the audit server."252

Later the same day (8 July 2010), Ms Thomas emailed Mr Jenkins that she had
prepared a Draft Additional Duplicate Transactions Witness Statement for him,
253 to which he responded, “that looks fine and | would be happy to sign that if

needed”>4. The statement included the wording set out at paragraph 138 above.

In response to POL’s email on 7 July 2010 agreeing to the amended witness
statement wording and the introduction of the Draft Additional Duplicate

Transactions Witness Statement, Ms Thomas emailed to POL a copy of the Draft

Additional Duplicate Transactions Witness Statement for POL’s review.2°> Ms
Thomas forwarded this correspondence to John Longman (Security Advisor,
POL), who responded that he was happy with the statement as “it confirms that
[the duplicate transactions issue] has no affect [sic] on Horizon’s accuracy. |
have added an extra paragraph to tie it in with the trial of Seema Misra and
confirm that only ARQ447 has any duplications within the disc you produced as
PT/02."255 Ms Thomas forwarded Mr Longman’s comment to Mr Jenkins with a
revised copy of the Draft Additional Duplicate Transactions Witness
Statement,”°” noting that the additions made related directly to West Byfleet (R v
Misra).2°8 Mr Jenkins responded “This look[s] fine. Do you want me to pop up
and sign it with you as a witness?’ and Ms Thomas confirmed that was okay.7°9
On 15 July 2010, Ms Thomas replied to Mr Longman “we’re happy with your
addition” and arranged for postage of the signed Draft Additional Duplicate

Transactions Witness Statement to POL.7°

The fix to Peak PC0200468 was successfully deployed with HNG-X Release 2
and the Peak was closed on 1 September 2010. Peak PC0194639 was closed

143. On 20 May 2014, Jason Muir (Security Operations Analyst, Fujitsu) emailed Mr

multiple copies of the data were stored” .?°+

144. On 21 May 2014, Mr Muir asked Mr Barnes to prepare an explanation for Fujitsu

reported that the latest occurrence of this was in ARQ 051-056 Caereithin FAD

Brain Lea (Software and Solution Developer, Post Office Account, Fujitsu) in
copy) as being a problem with Riposte where transactions were occasionally
duplicated in different files, adding “it is almost certain that all the other duplicates
are identical too but to be thorough you should really check each and every
one.”26° He emphasised “The key point is duplicate identical transactions are a

known issue which does not matter. However you need to confirm that you have

not got duplicate transactions which are not identical because that would be a

new issue of concern”.?67

145. Mr Kay asked Mr A. Holmes whether he had anything to add to Mr Barnes’
statement, bearing in mind this would be reported to POL.?°° Mr A. Holmes added
more detail on the reason for duplicates: “Under old Horizon, Riposte Audit data
was extracted from the correspondence servers (central transaction data
repositories) by an agent harvester process. These were then written as flat files
which were picked up and secured by the audit server. The design of this
harvester was such that duplicate records were allowed to be included in the
files. This would only happen in exception conditions and basically operated as
a fail safe i.e. err on the side of including duplicates rather than potentially losing
data. The design of this harvester, and the fact that duplicates may appear is
described in a very old Horizon document: “High Level Design of Common

Agents” AD/DES/042 §2”.2°

146. On 22 May 2014, Mr Kay replied to Ms Alexander's email of 19 May 2014, “we
identified two files containing the duplicate transactions and confirmed that the
first 4 duplicates and the last duplicate were all identical transactions. It is almost
certain that all the other duplicates are identical too.””° He further included the
explanations provided by Mr Barnes at 144, specifically that “the key point is
duplicate identical transactions are a known issue that does not matter’, and by

Mr A. Holmes as outlined in 145 above.2”'

2016 Incidents

148.

On 7 April 2016, Mr Dunks emailed Mr Barnes and Mr Muir (with Steve Goddard
(Software Development Manager, Fujitsu) copied) noting that a duplicate was
showing on a summary sheet, copied in the email.2”? Mr Barnes responded, “it is
something to be concerned about’, and a Peak should be raised.?”3 He added “/
am copying all the transaction files to the local disk of an audit workstation right
now. | have already got on a USB stick two files which contain the first set of
duplicates so that can be examined [...] | have studied the first message,
5026965, in detail and it looks like the complete and same transaction is in both

files.”274

Mr Dunks raised Peak PC0250729 on 8 April 2016 with the comment “some of
the data spread sheets that are generated via the audit retrieval process are
showing a number of duplicates on the summary sheef’.2”> The Peak was
allocated to Mr Barnes who added “the reason for these duplicates needs to be
identified before the prosecution team submits its spreadsheets”.2”° On 11 April
2016, Mr Barnes investigated the ‘AUD’ files generated on the 24 October 2015,
and found they had gathered twice “due to an error in the process of migrating
the share on which they lay from one platform to another’.2”’ Peak PC0250729
was closed on 26 April 2016 by Mr Muir with the comment “ARQ data sent to

149. On 14 July 2016 Farzin Denbali (Security Operations Analyst Post Office
Account, Fujitsu) wrote to Mr A. Holmes, “as we discussed a few days ago, there
are a large number of duplicate records in an ARQ output for FAD 173458” and
asked him to investigate the issue.?”? Mr Denbali also asked whether he could
send the ARQ to POL, to which Mr A. Holmes replied “no, don’t send the stuff to
POL until we know what’s going on.”®° Later the same day (14 July 2016) Mr
Denbali shared a file with Mr A. Holmes in an email chain entitled ‘duplicate

records in ARQ output’.261

150. On 14 July 2016, Mr Goddard forwarded Mr Dunks’ email and the subsequent
correspondence regarding duplicate transactions (document FUJ00172086) to
Mr A. Holmes and noted “it turned out that the share on which they sat was
migrated that day and the audit configuration file was modified by hand with two
separate paths to the same migrated share which caused the files to be copied
twice. It was incorrect procedure to modify the audit configuration files by
hand.”?82 Mr A. Holmes forwarded the correspondence again, to Mr Denbali,
adding “Farzin — your problem with duplicates in an ARQ is another occurrence
of the problem detailed below’, and asked Mr Dunks how the issue was “worked
around last time”.?8> Mr Dunks could not remember and deferred to Mr Barnes,
but Mr A. Holmes responded “there a couple of approaches we could take to
work around this and get the ARQ completed, but | think that it is better that we
wait until Gerald comes back on Monday and check what we did last time so we
can adopt a consistent approach. This problem is going to occur again for any

ARQs that overlap the date range 23rd — 25th Oct 2015. It would be a good idea
to add this, and the eventual workaround, to your list of ‘problem cases’ for

reference the next time it crops up.”284

151. On 15 July 2016, Mr Muir responded to the email chain attaching emails relating
to the 2014 Incident.”8° He wrote that the reason for the duplicate records in 2014
appeared to be different to the reason for the 2016 duplicate records, but that
Fujitsu “never highlighted the duplicates to them back in 2014 and | don’t recall
they ever queried it’.28° While Mr Muir made this statement at the time, it is
apparent from the contents of FUJ00176323 that Fujitsu did provide POL with an
explanation as to the duplications in the 2014 Incident.2°7 Mr Muir suggested
completing a check that had been suggested by Mr Barnes at the time of the
2014 Incident, and confirm that the duplicate transactions were identical, as if
they were not identical, this would be “a new issue of concern”.28° Mr A. Holmes
responded “the reason behind the 2014 duplicates will be different to this

case.”289

152. On 18 July 2016, Mr Barnes replied to Mr Dunks’ email of 14 July 2016 asking
him how the 2014 Incident had been resolved, “if you redo the queries as slow
ARQs then you can produce the spreadsheets but with the duplicates listed. You
then need a separate explanation to be [sent] to the Post Office as to why there

are dupplicates [sic] in this case.”9° Mr Muir replied, “far as we can see the

duplicate records are already showing in the ARQ data. We will send the data to

HISTORIC GAPS IN ARQ DATA

153.

154.

In preparing this corporate statement, Fujitsu has identified a small number of
documents in relation to this topic that had not previously been disclosed to the

Inquiry. These documents are exhibited to this statement.?°2

On 1 December 2021, Paul Gauntlett (Customer Solution Architect, Fujitsu)
emailed Steven Browell (Chief Information Security Officer, Fujitsu), with other
Fujitsu personnel in copy (namely Gerald Barnes (Software Engineer, Fujitsu),
Manisha Mistry (Service Delivery Manager, Fujitsu) and Phil Boardman (Service
Architect, Fujitsu)) regarding a “Historical Issue with Audit Data” (the “Historic
ARQ Gaps Issue’). Mr Gauntlett explained that, during a meeting with John Nelis
(Problem Manager, POL) and Dean Bessell (POL) the previous day, an issue
was discussed regarding audit data gathered prior to 2010 existing only on one
audit server and not both. Mr Gauntlett was asked to write up what was
communicated to POL during this meeting, so POL could discuss this with their
legal team. Mr Gauntlett prepared a draft write-up, in relation to which Mr
Boardman, Mr Barnes and Mr Browell provided input.29° According to this write-

up:294

a.  Riposte was used in Legacy Horizon “to gather audit transactions from

all the Post Office counters... deployed in the Bootle & Wigan data

29" FUJ00216439
282 See the documents listed at Exhibit numbers 199 to 270 in this regard
298 FUJ00176507
294 FUJ00176508

WITN06650300
WITN06650300
WITN06650300
WITN06650300

centres and on the Post Office counters... Each evening the Riposte
databases in each data centre were copied to the local Audit Archive
— this was done by the local Harvester...there were occasions when
the Harvester in one data centre would exhibit faults which would
interrupt the process of copying the transaction data to the Audit
Archive resulting in some data not being copied to the Audit Archive.
There is no recorded instance of both harvesters failing at the same.
Although data may be missing from one Audit Archive server, it will be
present on the other Audit Archive in the other data centre (and the
ARQ process checks for this when retrieval requests are

processed)”.

b.  Riposte was not deployed in the HNG-X solution, and the Wigan and
Bootle Data Centres were migrated to the IRE11 and IRE19 audit
servers. From 2010 onwards, “all transaction and non-transaction files
[were] gathered in IRE11 and harvested to the IRE11 Audit Archive
only. Live data is automatically mirrored to IRE19 — including to the
IRE19 Audit Archive. Under HNG-X, all audit files (transaction and

non-transaction) are consistent across both Audit Archive servers’.

c. In terms of the potential impact of this issue on ARQ Reliability, “ARQ
queries are run against one of the Audit Archives. In the unlikely event
that the results show any gaps, the query is run against the other Audit
Archive to add the missing data and provide a holistic response to the

requestor. There have been no reported instances of gaps in ARQ

295 See for example FUJO0176543

Page 74 of 103
WITN06650300
WITN06650300

retrievals once a query has been executed against both Audit

Archives”.

155. On the same day, Simon Oldnall (Horizon IT Director, POL) emailed Mr Browell
noting that “/t/he PCI team have flagged an issue to me around potential issues
with the data integrity of the audit San. The initial feedback I’m hearing is that
this is a historical issue, however this does raise a number of concerns”. Mr
Oldnall asked Mr Browell to provide Mr Bessell with a “more detailed brief on
what the issues were, the history of these issues and any ongoing concerns that

may exist’.2°6

156. On 3 December 2021, Mr Browell circulated his working notes on the Historic
Gaps Issue to a number of Fujitsu recipients, including Mr Barnes, Mr Gauntlett,
Jason Muir (Information Security Manager, Fujitsu) and Geoff Baker (Information
Security Manager, Enterprise & Cyber Security, EMEIA, Fujitsu). Mr Browell
explained that ARQ retrievals can be run as a “Fast’ retrieval or a “Slow” retrieval.
The Slow ARQ process would look for and handle gaps in the sequencing of
JSNs. The Fast ARQ process, in contrast, “will abort if the sequence of JSNs has
gaps’ (see CP 4867, FUJ00155474%"). If the operator of the ARQ retrieval was

alerted to gaps?%*:

a. In Legacy Horizon, “they should rerun the SLOW query against the

other archive as it is unlikely that BOTH archives will have gaps”.

b. In HNG-X, “they should raise an Incident as this is not expected’.

297 FUJ00155474
298 FUJ00176516

157.

158.

c. In relation to both (a) and (b) above, Mr Browell’s notes included a
comment that “/this relies on [the operator] deciding to do this and

could be subject to human errory’.

On 6 December 2002, Mr Browell sent an email to Fujitsu personnel including Mr
Barnes, Mr Muir and Mr Gauntlett with the subject “CONFIDENTIAL - Audit
Archive — The action plan?®°. According to this email, Fujitsu’s investigation into
potential gaps in the audit data included (i) confirming whether incomplete ARQ
transaction responses have ever been sent to POL, and whether POL have
always been aware of any such gaps, (ii) confirming whether there were any
gaps in the audit data being stored by Fujitsu at that time, (iii) understanding how
harvester issues were recorded/actioned, and if there were any current harvester
issues that needed to be addressed, and (iv) confirming that Fujitsu is confident

in the design of the HNG-X harvester.

Mr Browell provided Fujitsu’s response to the Historic ARQ Gaps Issue on 11
January 20225°. This included a summary of the issue in similar terms to

paragraph 154 above. In relation to the ARQ process, Mr Browell’s email stated:

a. “There have been a small number of suspected gap issues
investigated. It is understood that all investigations were resolved,
including by re-running the ARQ against the second data store
(Horizon) or by extending the date ranges (HNG-X) resulting in no

gaps in any ARQ responses."

300 FUJ00176487

Page 76 of 103

WITN06650300
WITN06650300
“The ARQ process includes the adding of warnings for gaps in the
resulting files sent to POL. If there had been any gaps, POL would

have been made aware within the ARQ responses supplied.”

“One known gap (for a specific FAD and date) was identified as part
of ARQ extracts performed against the Bootle archive. That gap is not
in the Wigan audit archive though. Therefore, Fujitsu is not aware of
any gaps in the audit archive data for Horizon when both archives are

used’.

“There have been no gaps identified as part of any ARQ extracts

performed against the HNG-X audit archive’.

159. Mr Oldnall responded to Mr Browell’s email on 14 February 2022 seeking further

information including (i) an explanation of the harvesting process and the

parameters used when running ARQs, and (ii) an explanation of how gaps in the

audit archives manifest in the ARQ data sent to POL and how they are brought

to POL's attention.°°' Mr Browell responded to these questions on 17 March

2022, as follows:

301 FUJ00176487

As a general point, “/n the unlikely event that there are gaps in the
Audit Archive, the ARQ process would spot it and if this could not be
reconciled by using the second Audit Archive store, POL would be

notified of the true gap found. POL would be aware of the gap”.

In relation to the harvesting process, this “archives the data from

BRDB to flat files which are then stored in the Audit Archive. The

Page 77 of 103

WITN06650300
WITN06650300
method of doing this has changed over the years as data storage

changed”.

c. _ Inrelation to the parameters used when running ARQs, these are “the
provided FAD code and date range requested for the type of content

requested (typically branch transaction and event data”.

d. In relation to how gaps are identified and notified to POL, the
application used to run the ARQ requests, AEClient, “checks the
transaction sequence numbers which are the unique and sequential
identifiers of transactions made at a branch. If any gaps in the
sequence numbers are identified, this signals that there is a gap in the
IRE11 audit archive data. The presence of a gap is presented to the
operator...If this happens for pre HNG-X then the audit archive in
IRE19 is checked. If that also shows a gap for the matching search
criteria, then a true gap will have been found. If a true gap had been
found, then the ARQ response spreadsheet would highlight this to

POL".

OTHER POTENTIAL ISSUES RELATING TO ARQ DATA

160. In addition to the issues identified in this statement, | understand that Fujitsu
disclosed to the Inquiry 102 documents from its Peak, PinICL and Known Error
Log (“KEL”) databases on 14 July 2023. These documents were identified by
Fujitsu as records of incidents referring to the ARQ process in the context of court

proceedings.

Page 78 of 103

WITN06650300
WITN06650300
161. Many of the documents disclosed relate to system changes and support issues

rather than issues with the ARQ data that was extracted and provided to POL.

However, there are certain Peaks set out below that could be relevant to the

issue of ARQ Reliability. In the time available, Fujitsu has not been able to

investigate these Peaks in any detail but would be willing to do so if the Inquiry

requests that it does.
