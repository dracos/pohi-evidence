8.43 “We did try and bring it down to 60 and I want to make an arrangement to

clear the balance. I would appreciate it if I can have a chance to clear the
shortage. I made up 2 cash pouches as we were borrowing some money from
friends and family to fill these rem bags up. That's why I want to speak to
friends and family (INAUDIBLE). This loss in branch has been carried forward
for over a year. Over the last year we put money in to make it right...shortage.
We took over the staff from the previous owner and for about a year and a
half they were running the Post Office© with us as we thought they run it for
many years they ought to know better than us. But after a while when we learn
more and more we noticed that things weren't right, like, there were 4000 euro
missing, money transferred to the ATM was actually shorter than the actual
money transferred over. Lottery money was taken from the shop and never
entered on HORIZON even on the shop side the till were low. (INAUDIBLE)
they refuses to pay and we kept quiet and we don't want to lose the Post
Office©. After that as well we (INAUDIBLE) which we have cleared. Once
again I want to clear all the losses and I promise it will clear everything and we
will not disappoint you. Seema MISRA 14" January 2.25”
