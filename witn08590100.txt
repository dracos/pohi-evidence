                     POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY




          FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF COLIN LENTON-SMITH




I, COLIN LENTON-SMITH will say as follows:-

INTRODUCTION



   1. I am a former employee of Fujitsu Services Ltd and held the position of

     Commercial and Finance Director, ICL Pathway Ltd, later Post Office

     Account.


   2. This witness statement is made to assist the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry

     (the "Inquiry") with the matters set out in the Rule 9 Request dated 181h April

     2022 (the "Request").


BACKGROUND


  3. I qualified as a member of the Institute of Chartered Accounts in England Wales

     and worked in industry from 1979 and predominantly in the IT industry from

     1985. I joined International Computers Ltd (ICL) in 1990 as a Commercial

     Manager within the International Division; I then worked for ICL Pathway Ltd

                                                                                   WITN08590100
                                                                                    WITN08590100




  and Fujitsu Services in various Commercial Management roles until I retired in

  September 2018 (ICL was taken over by Fujitsu in 2002).



4. I joined ICL Pathway in March 2001, which later became Post Office

  Account (Fujitsu), as the Commercial and Finance Director until October

  2007. My role involved managing an autonomous finance team and a small

  commercial team to contract manage the Horizon contract with Post Office

  and execute contract changes for additional functionality releases, notably

  Network Banking. When Fujitsu separated the Commercial and Finance

  functions in 2003/4, I relinquished management of the finance team to a

  Financial Controller in the Finance function. My role then, within Fujitsu's

  Commercial function, was to continue to contract manage the existing

  contract but also to carry out the financial modelling and manage the

  commercial negotiations of the contract for Horizon Next Generation (HNG)

  signed in September 2006.



5. Regarding Post Office Ltd (POL) legal action against SPMs, as part of the

  service for Horizon, Fujitsu provided support to POL as and when required

  in the form of audit data, witness statements and if required appearances

  in court. Outside of the standard service POL may request Fujitsu to provide

  special assistance.

                                                                                        WITN08590100

  6. If POL decided to make a case a commercial matter, then I would receive formal

     notification by letter from Keith Baines, POL Commercial Manager. I kept a

     separate email folder for the correspondence on a particular case and as far as

     I remember, there were very few cases dealt with between Keith Baines and

     myself -less than 5, over the period March 2001 to October 2007. I cannot recall

     the names of the cases involved.




Post Office Limited v Mrs J Wolstenholme (Cleveleys Post Office)



  7. My recollection, prompted by the listed documents, is as set out in the

     specific points below.



  8. I would say that I became aware that POL had an issue that required assistance

     from Fujitsu in August 2003. I am not able to pinpoint a date exactly before the

     date of the email to me from Jan Holmes dated 20/8/2003 (FUJ00121482).

     POL Legal Services were looking for information to support the POL litigation

     against Mrs Wolstenholme, SPM of Cleveleys Post Office. I can't be specific

     about the details of the request as I don't have site of the papers faxed over

     from POL as Jan Holmes noted in his email to me dated 20/08/2023 but can

     only refer to Jan Holmes' response, reviewed by me on 21/08/2023, and

     included in Jan Holmes' email to Jim Cruise POL — Subject — Cleveleys —

     Horizon Equipment dated 21/8/2023 (WITN04600202).



  9. I have been asked to consider the following documents:-




                                    Page 3of17
                                                                                   WITNO8590100
                                                                                 WITN08590100
                                                                                  WITN08590100




   i) A letter from Keith Baines to me dated 5 February 2004 (POL00095375),

    ii) An email from Jan Homes to me dated 18 February 2004

   (FUJ00121485), and enclosed draft response to POL (FUJ00121486),

    iii) My email to Jan Holmes in reply dated 18 February 2004

   (FUJ00121489) and his reply to me on the same date (FUJ00121490),

    iv) My email to Jan Holmes dated 20 February 2004 (FUJ00121502 and

    his email to me of the same date (FUJ00121507 and v) The report I sent

    to Keith Baines at POL on 20 February 2004 (FUJ00121511 and

    FUJ00121512).



10. I refer to Keith Baines letter to me of 05/02/2004 (POL00095375) which

    states that Mrs Wolstenholme had made a counter claim against POL as

    a result of deficiencies in the Horizon systems, the HSH service. Mrs

    Wolstenholme claimed that the Horizon system itself caused losses in the

    sub post office accounts. As a result, she wanted the computer equipment

    to be examined by an expert witness before agreeing to release it to

    Fujitsu. This is why the County Court instructed the parties to commission

    a report from an expert approved by the Court, which I understand was

    produced by Jason Coyne.



11. My understanding is that the role of the expert was to have knowledge

    and experience of IT and knowledge and understanding of the Horizon

    system so as be able to provide a factually correct, unambiguous, neutral,

    independent statement for the benefit of the Court.

                                                                                    WITN08590100
                                                                                     WITN08590100




12. I expressed Fujitsu's view of the expert report in the Response to Expert's

   Opinion attached as an Appendix to my letter to Keith Baines dated

   20/02/2004 Section "Conclusion" (FUJ00121512). It was concerning that as

   the sole expert opinion, the report reflected that the expert did not have a

   detailed understanding of how the Horizon system works and in relation to

   the expert's point "Worrying Discrepancies" the report inferred that system

   errors may be responsible but there was no evidence available to

   substantiate this inference.



13. I have been asked what was the "data/response that we/POL have used

   before which countered the PM system problem allegation" referred to in

   FUJ00121489. It is my recollection that there had not been any earlier POL

   legal actions that had been raised by Keith Baines to me as a commercial

   issue. This question posed in my email was simply to check with Jan Holmes

   that if he had been involved in providing litigation support at an operational

   level had this provided data/or response in respect of an allegation by a Post

   Master (PM) (i.e. SPM) to system problems.



14. I am not able to say whether POL Investigations provided Fujitsu with any

   data or information to assist with this case other than to keep alignment and

   monitor progress through ongoing email correspondence, telephone calls

   and a case management conference.



15. Based on the email from Jim Cruise dated 03/03/2004 (FUJ00121534) POL's

   concerns about the experts report from Best Practice were that the expert


                                  Page 5of17
                                                                                        WITNO8590100
                                                                                      WITN08590100
                                                                                       WITN08590100




  had not revised his report in the light of Fujitsu's Response to Expert's

  Opinion (FUJ00121512).



16. As to why Jim Cruise was concerned about the case, I can only rely on the

   direct information from Jim Cruise's email to Keith Baines and me dated

   04/03/2004 (FUJ00121534) in respect of the initial report of Jason Coyne

   of Best Practice Group, where he stated that the expert report "cannot be

   accepted by POL and that an application needs to be made to the court for

   Fujitsu to give evidence about the Horizon system and its working in view

   of the stance taken by the expert witness".



17. 1 have been asked if the problems reported by Mrs Wolstenholme (in

   particular, blue screens, system freezes and screen lock issues) were

   common problems being encountered by the Horizon users in early

   2000s.This is a technical question which I am not able to answer.



18. In regard to Fujitsu's response to the expert report as communicated by POL,

   in the letter from Keith Baines to me dated 05/02/2004 (POL0095375), he

   requested Fujitsu Service's view of the main points in the expert report, and if

   Fujitsu did not agree with them to suggest what information or advice Fujitsu

   can provide to the expert that might lead him to change his finding. Fujitsu's

   detailed response is set out in the Appendix "Response to Expert's Opinion"

   in my letter to Keith Baines dated 20/02/2004 (FUJ00121512).

17. In terms of what data was available to Fujitsu which compiling their

   response, this is a technical question which I am not able to answer.



18. I have been asked to consider the following documents:-

    i) An email from Jim Cruise to me and others dated 4 March 2004

   (FUJ00121533) and the attachments (FUJ00121534, FUJ00121535 and

   FUJ00121536), ii) My email to Jan Holmes dated 4 March 2004

   (FUJ00121541), iii) An email from Jan Holmes to me dated 4 March 2004

   (FUJ00121549) and attachment (FUJ00121550), iv) An email from Jan

   Homes to me dated 11 March 2004 (FUJ00121557) and attachment

   (FUJ00121558), v) An email from Jan Holmes to me dated 12 March 2004

   (FUJ00121561) and attachment (FUJ00121562), vi) An email from Jan

   Holmes to Jim Cruise, copied to me dated 12 March 2004 (FUJ00121567)

   and attachment (FUJ00121568); vii) An email from Jan Holmes to me dated

   6 April 2004 (FUJ00121602) and viii) An email from Jan Holmes to me dated

   7 June 2004 (FUJ00121637).




19. I found the response from the expert to the points made by POL/Fujitsu to

   be disappointing, as per my email to Jan Holmes dated 04/03/2004

   (FUJ00121541).




20. At the request of Jim Cruise in his email to Keith Baines and myself dated

   04/03/2004 (FUJ00121534) he welcomed any further points on the expert's

   position set out in Jason Croyne's email to Weightman Vizards dated

                                                                                            WITN08590100
                                                                                             WITN08590100




    02/03/2004 (FUJ00121535) attached to Jim Cruise's email. Fujitsu's response

     was to provide POL with a response to the Expert's Reply to Fujitsu Services

     Submission (FUJ00121568) with the email to Jim Cruise from Jan Holmes

     dated 12/03/2004 (FUJ00121567). This also included an invitation via POL for

     Fujitsu to offer to host Jason Coyne, the expert, at any of Fujitsu's Post Office

     Account locations, arrange interviews and provide access to data and records

     he required. I am aware from the Report on Cleveleys Post Office

     (FUJ00121747) that POL did not pass onto the expert, Jason Coyne, either

     Fujitsu's response to the initial expert report or the invitation to the host him at

     a Fujitsu Post Office Account location.


21. Additionally, a draft witness statement from Jan Holmes was written

     providing a description of the support services provided by Fujitsu to POL

     in respect of the Horizon system and its users (FUJ00121707).


22. Fujitsu also provided a Report on the Cleveleys Post Office dated 01/09/2004

     (FUJ00121747) which describes the involvement of Fujitsu Post Office

     Account with Post Office Security Investigations in the matter of Cleveleys Post

     Office and the dispute between POL and the Postmaster (SPM). This

     document includes at section 5.0 a copy of Jan Holmes' Witness Statement,

     referred to above, which appears to have been lodged with Blackpool County

     Court, dated August 2004, Claim No. CR101947 between Post Office

     Counters Limited and Mrs Julie Wolstenholme.

23. My understanding of why POL wanted to keep the expert report out of the

    public domain, I refer to the letter from Keith Baines to me dated 05/02/2004

    (POL00095375) he states that POL was concerned of the findings in the

    expert's report because of any precedent that this might set and used by

    SPMs to support claims that the Horizon Systems caused errors in their

    branch accounts.



24. I have been asked if Fujitsu had any concerns about the approach of trying

    to settle cases, this was a matter for POL to decide how to conduct their

    legal actions against SPMs.



25. I have been asked about my views on the strategic approach being

    suggested by POL, if by a strategic approach the point is referring to

    mediation or settlement in the documents at paragraph 18 above, then it

    was my view that it was a matter for POL to decide how to conduct their

    legal action.



26. I have been asked to consider an email from Jan Homes to Ian Lamb dated

    30/07/2004 (FUJ00121668). It is my view that in the email Jan Holmes is

    conveying a conversation he had with Keith Baines about a conversation

    Keith had with Dave Smith (POL) in that it was Dave Smith's opinion that

    POL shouldn't have settled the case.



27. I have been asked to consider the following documents:-




                                   Page 9 of 17
                                                                                   WITNO8590100

                                                                                  WITN08590100




   i) An email from Jan Holmes to Keith Banes, copied to me amongst others

  dated 3 August 2004 (FUJ00121686), ii) An email from Jam Holmes to David

  Barker, copied to me dated 10 August 2004 (FUJ00121702), iii) Email from Jan

  Holmes to me dated 11 August 2004 (FUJ00121704) with attachments

  (FUJ00121705, FUJ00121706, FUJ00121707) and iv) An email from Jan

  Holmes to me and William Mitchell dated 20 August 2004 (FUJ00212724).



28. My view on the outcome of the Cleveleys case was that the outcome was

    a matter for POL.



29. I have been asked if it could be constructed from the documents listed at

    paragraph 27 above that POL bought off Mrs Wolstenholme rather than

    defend their system, no and the way that POL decided to conduct and

    settle the case was a matter for POL.



30. I have been asked to consider and email to me dated 2 September 2004

    seeking approval of the Fujitsu report on Cleveleys Post Office

    (FUJ00121746) with attachment (FUJ00121747).



31. The retention period for TMS transaction data in 2000 was 18 months

    after which the data was deleted as per the then terms of the Horizon

    contract with POL. TMS transaction data was no longer deleted after 18

    months for data archived after 181h May 2002 which then made data

    available for audit purposes. This is described in the Report on Cleveleys

    Post Office section 3.2 POA Involvement (FUJ00121747).

32. The absence of transaction data from 2000 meant that it could not be

     demonstrated that the system was operating normally during the disputed

     time period of the Cleveleys case.



33. I have been asked to consider the following documents:-

     i) Email from Forrest Hilary to me dated 30 March 2004 (FUJ00121584) and

     attached draft minutes (FUJ00121585), ii) email to Pam Purewal dated 31

     March 2004 (FUJ00121590) and attachment (FUJ00121591), iii) Email from

    Forrest Hilary to Pam Purewal and me (FUJ00121620) and attachment

     (FUJ00121621) and iv) email from Pam Purewal to me amongst others dated

     5 May 2004 (FUJ211632 and the enclosed final minutes (FUJ00121636).




34. I have been asked what was meant by the note in the original draft minutes at

     page 5 "did Colin take an action to arrange a discussion with Keith to see how

     we can avoid Julie Wolstenhomes in the future? — / have it noted as a non

     urgent action" and why this note was modified in later version of the draft

     minutes and the final minutes. Minutes of the Commercial Forum were taken

     by John Cole (POL) and issued to Pam Purewal (Fujitsu) as a draft for Fujitsu's

     comment and revisions to reach a version of the Minutes agreed by POL and

    Fujitsu. Closed actions and old notes were greyed out to assist readers of the

     minutes to focus on current matters. The Fujitsu attendees would take notes

     of the Commercial Forum to have a collective view of any amendments

     needed to be made to the draft minutes received from POL. In the email

     (FUJ00121584) dated 30/03/2004, Hilary Forrest forwarded to me an updated

    draft version of Commercial Forum No 15, draft minutes including her notes,

    comments and Fujitsu internal questions shown in square brackets as a

    prompt for my consideration (FUJ00121585). Section 15.05 has several

    such comments and notes in square brackets; one being a prompt

    regarding the Julie Wolstenholme's case that was discussed in the

    Commercial Forum No. 15 but omitted from the POL draft minutes. The

    revised version of the draft minutes sent back to POL includes my revisions

    and includes below item 15.06 a Noted section which conveys a minute of

    the comments made by Keith Baines (POL) at the Commercial Forum

    (FUJ00121591), namely:

     "KB advised that PO were trying to negotiate a settlement with regards to

      the Julie Wolstenholme case.

     KB further suggested that a discussion should be held between both parties

      at some future date to understand how the situation regarding the "Expert"

      could be avoided in the future. "

      Fujitsu's Noted wording was accepted by POL as it included without change

      in the draft minutes of Commercial Forum Minutes No. 16 (Draft 1)

     (FUJ00121621) and in Minutes No.16 (Final) (FUJ00121686).
