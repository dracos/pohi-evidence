POA Improvements — Streams 5-7
Improved Ways of Working & Actions Required

FUJITSU CONFIDENTIAL — INTERNAL USE ONLY (POA ONLY)

What's New?

This document describes a number of changes to the Post Office Account ways of working and use
of systems. This section provides highlights but the entire document should be read to gather
awareness of all changes being implemented.

Our interactions needs to be system and process driven, not people and experience — and that will
create a clear audit trail too.

We need to limit the dependency on meeting-specific reports or embedded tables in minutes to show
progress on important matters.

Transparency is key — to the fullest sensible extent, POL need to see everything — and they need to
be able to see it in their systems or from consistent reports from our systems. That way, POL are
informed and able to make decisions for us or with us.

POA Improvements — Streams 5-7
Improved Ways of Working & Actions Required

FUJITSU CONFIDENTIAL — INTERNAL USE ONLY (POA ONLY)

Introduction & Overview

The Goal...
To implement the defined list of improvements in this document in substantive part by...

31° July 2021

...and to have completed all improvement including any early challenges and snags by

31% August 2021

Purpose & Scope

o Byrunning a series of Streams of work we will systematically drive improvements across
POA

o The Streams will likely overlap and may well change format as progress is made
o Although active participation in a Stream may be low for.some, it is critical that there is a

common understanding or we will not achieve cross functional change

Stream members may change over time

Each Stream will have a set of actions to complete = initially derived from this document

The team can add additional actions as needed

POA needs to urgently evolve to a cross functionally agreed set of ways of working so that it

can be explained to any interested party,withease

o Our interactions needs to be system and process driven not people and experience — and
that will create a clear audit trail too

o Weneed to limit the dependency on meeting-specific reports or embedded tables in minutes
to show progress on important matters

o Transparency is key — to the fullestsensible extent, POL need to see everything — and they
need to be able to see it in their systems or from consistent reports from our systems. That
way, POL are informed and.able to make decisions for us or with us

o We need to agree'the functions of the various platforms and meetings to ensure it all joins up
(this document is astart)

co If POL is»tracking it — or applying governance to it — then so should we — and our process
should be in advance of theirs so we have no surprises

o We.do not have all the tools and integrations we would like, so the goal is to make the best
possibleuse of what we have already

o Weneed to protect our internal systems from a need for routine disclosure — so we can work
our way

o We need to ensure any POL desires on our ways of working relate to contracted obligations
and suit how our systems and people work — unless we are commissioned to change any of
those — as this is more likely to be consistent and reliable

o For this to succeed we need considerable cross functional support coupled with manager and
team member engagement

Improved Ways of Working & Actions Required
FUJITSU CONFIDENTIAL — INTERNAL USE ONLY (POA ONLY)
Each Stream documents the key elements that reinforce an existing way of working or state a new
way of working. This content will be embedded into existing account documents for it to be
formalised. Each Stream will then contain references to any System Changes made (optional), the
One-Time Actions needed to move to the defined ways of working, and then the New Ways of
Working that will describe what is different from how things are done today.
Actions that have been completed are scored out. The One-Time Actions that are underway at the
moment are highlighted in green although some of the other actions may also be partly active too.

o TBC
e Investigate the use of the remote Syslog server and determine if any logging should
be directed to Netcool. Capacity issues may limit options

= 23.07
ad

RE Syslog
Netcool.msg

e All of the network (incl. firewall) logs are sent to the Syslog servers.
This is good for two reasons: 1)rlt,is best practice to keep your logs
off the security platform that may be compromised then it is not easy
for the adversary to delete the logs to cover their tracks and 2)
Having a central log store makes applying SIEM type intelligence
(and doing debugging) easier than having to collect it directly.

« Netcool was never sized to handle the network logs so it only
collects what it.considers’are “interesting” events. You probably
recall that we had similar issues with the Linux and Windows logs
under HDCR when we increased the logging to capture forensic
detail/but Netcool / Tivoli couldn't cope with the volume. And of
course;Post Office have rejected funding a proper SIEM solution.

« sTherefore,we have a lot of network security information in the
Syslog servers but it is not monitored or analysed for issues.

* Action

o What is “interesting” —- John Bradley says it is not
documented but is in a baseline
= We filter out by exception and Jason is waiting for

this

= Need to check this doesn’t exclude things we want to
cover

= What's we keep goes to Netcool and to Audit
Archive

o How long do we keep the syslog events for?
= Forever if in Audit Archive
« Counter access — why are counters accessed so frequently, should access be on
request not by default to protect our staff and the company from incorrect
accusations.
= Action
e We need to restrict RCA capability to escalate privileges
e We need to confirm that RCA commands are read only
« We need to confirm with CC that the user account on the counter are
read only
o All documented in DES/GEN/SPE/2745
