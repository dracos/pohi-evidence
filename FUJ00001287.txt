1. Introduction

This purpose of this document is to identify POCL requirements relating to the Contractual
Authorities Responsibilities - CAR 531.000.003 . This document does not specify the
questions that will be asked but they will form part of the training courses to be agreed The
more detailed processes are described in documents BP/PRD/013 and IM/SST/001. POCL
will also jointly agree (ref SLA915 and CAR 531) competency standards with ICL Pathway

As competency testing is the terminology recognised by ICL Pathway and POCL , it will be
used for the purpose of this response, however when transferred into the classroom
environment, it will be known as the Horizon Achievement Certificate, which after an
assessment of the individuals knowledge they will be awarded.

There are a range of Horizon assessments. The questions asked will depend on the Users job
type and role SU/TRN / Refers to :-

010 Managers/ Subpostmsters
O11 Assistants/Counter Clerks
012 Auditors and Specialists

013 Refers to Train the Trainers and HFSO

2. Scope

The scope of this document is limited to describing the deliverables of ICL Pathway to meet
POCLs contractual requirements as outlined in (SLA915 and CARS31) . The detailed
processes supporting this document are described in BP/PRD/013 and IM/SST/001/002

This document addresses the issues listed below:-

© example areas covered by the competency test and the different test weightings for each
stream of trainee

e the number and general types of example questions each stream might be asked to answer
using the Horizon system and general style/format/approach to be taken.

© the remedial process for individuals failing the competency test at each stage and the
process dealing with those failing three times. Further documented in associated
documents

e specify the minimum compliance data by which outlets will be authorized as training
compliant to go live and the POCL processes in place to minimize risks (further detailed in

3. Process For Dealing With Attendees Failing A Competency Test During
Rollout

Competency testing will apply to all attendees but the emphasis of the testing will vary. It will
consist of a pass or fail with a mark of over 90% constituting a pass. The test will last no
longer than 1 hour.

Those attendees failing to attain the pass mark the first time will be given the necessary
remedial training.( see SU/TRN/006) They will be offered at the end of their initial training
course up to an additional 2.5 hours training, concentrating on their specific areas of
weakness, and they will be given a further test only in the area where they initially failed. A
second failure may mean a further I or I % days training, ideally within the 5 day window,
however this is dependent on when they had their first training and on personal circumstances.
It will also involve a further full competency test. The remedial training is mandatory and must
be within the five day window if MTC has not be met, otherwise no later than 2 days after go
live during the HFSO time at the outlet.

Failure on the third attempt by the attendee will discharge ICL Pathway from further training.

In this case POCL will take over responsibility ensuring their trainers who have been Horizon
accredited to bring POCL staff and agents up to the competency standard. It will be the
responsibility of the agent to bring their own staff up to a competent standard. (ref:
IM/SST/001 & IM/SST/002) This standard will mean they have used the Horizon system in
training mode and are capable of serving customers at the outlet supported by the
Subpostmaster or their staff.

In such circumstances where it is apparent the attendee will not attain the required standard,
normal process’s currently used will apply (See Subpostmasters contract)

Subpostmaster’s assistants are the responsibility of their subpostmaster to bring them to the
required standard with local on-site training after roll out. It is a contractual requirement and
is in their best interests both financially and from a customer/client point of view to ensure
their staff are competent.

Subpostmasters will be responsible and are required to sign a certificate declaring that their
employee(s) have achieved the agreed acceptable standard to operate the Horizon system. The
certificate will be held at the outlet and on a visit the RNM may wish to view it.

Below is a table of how training will be carried out in the event of failure to meet a competent
standard or failure to attend training :-

GRADE METHOD

Branch Manager Supported by POCL Accredited Trainer or
HFSO

Counter Clerk Local training by Branch Manager or HFSO

SubPostmaster Supported by POCL Accredited Trainer or
HFSO

Assistant Supported by Subpostmaster and/or HFSO

Trainer TBA

Auditor Additional training given locally

RNM No further training proposed

HFSO Failure of competency test will result in them
returning to their original job role

OTHERS No further training planned.

4, Reporting Process

Reports will be submitted from ICL Pathway on a monthly basis for those attending training
and in addition exception reports will be sent via e-mail informing RLMs of those individuals
failing their 1“, 2" and 3" attempts. (SU/REP/021 document refers)

5. Process for communication Pass or Failure of Competency Test

It is the responsibility of the ICL Pathway trainer to assess from the competency test results if
an individual has reached the required standard . If they have, the Horizon Achievement
Certificate will be posted to them at their outlet. Those who fail will need to be told at the end
of training so that the remedial training process can be invoked . The form of words to be
used in the event of failure at any of the stages of training is documented in a letter from
Trevor Rollason to Andy Barkham dated xxxxxxx and Titled xxxxxxx see appXXXx

7. Competency Weighting

The contractual requirement is for attendees to attain over 90% for a pass mark. POCL need
to ensure it adequately covers the individuals primary work area. For an individual whose

primary role is to serve on the counter or work within the counter environment section (B) of
table (B) is paramount and weighted accordingly. POCL proposes that for the top 4 attendees

in the table (B) they must achieve over 90% in this category as well as an overall score of over

90% and above

8. Transaction Times During Competency

There are laid down times for processing each type of transaction, as people are new to the
system they will be slower at first. It is proposed that when measuring competency that all

individuals will have 1 hour to complete the role play and questions. Pass or failure will

therefore be determined on the answers correctly completed .

ing Compliance Matrix For Outlets to Go Live

below is a guide and should be used as a suggestion to regions and ICL Pathway on how many
competent staff are needed within an outlet before go live. It is recommended the
Implementation teams from both ICL and POCL define this criteria/process to suit roll out or

release 2/ 2+. It is impossible to provide definitive guidelines due the varying sizes of outlets

and the ratio’s of staff to counter positions .

Number Of People In Outlet MTC
1 subpostmaster
2 subpostmaster
3 subpostmaster + 1
4 subpostmaster + 1
5 subpostmaster + 2
6 subpostmaster_ +3
7 subpostmaster + 3

8 subpostmaster + 4
9 subpostmaster + 5
10 subpostmaster + 5
ll subpostmaster + 6
12 subpostmaster + 6
13 subpostmaster + 7
14 subpostmaster + 7

For branch offices the MTC is branch manager and or assistant branch manager plus 50% of
the workforce, it is however highly unlikely that any MTC issues will arise at branch offices.
100% of Branch Office Staff will either have had to pass their competency test or have
additional training arranged prior to migration as ECCO offices will be swapped out
differently to Sub Offices (SeeMigration Paper)

11. Communication

POCL will develop a policy document covering steady state training which will be forwarded
to each region for delivery in a standard way across all regions. The communication of the
POCL policy will be the responsibility of each region.

12. Competency Assessment In Steady State

Once an outlet has gone live it becomes the responsibility of POCL to train the new
subpostmaster.

For Horizon this will be delivered as defined in document IM/SST/001/002. At the end of the
training the subpostmaster will be expected to have attained the required standard currently
measured by POCL in the acceptance of new subpostmasters. (IM/SST/001 - skills matrix
measure)

The subpostmaster who will be Horizon trained will in turn be responsible for training his new
staff to an acceptable standard, supported by a new POCL Horizon training guide currently
being developed by NT& DT. They will not be giving a competency test to their assistants,
but will be signing a certificate to demonstrate that they have given their employee training to
an agreed standard on the use of the Horizon system.

All new POCL counter and franchise staff will be expected to reach the required standards as
part of their counter skills training course. RNM s can monitor outlet training via the Outlet
Review Process.

13. POCL Steady State Competency Assessment

POCL will issue the documentation to assess the competency of a subpostmaster to run an
outlet. For Horizon this assessment will be introduced for Live trial and National Roll Out
