I agree with counsel. In my opinion the evidence clearly shows theft (charge 1), however, if the
defence are offering up guilty pleas to all False Accounting charges (2 - 15 on my copy of indictment),
then i would suggest we accept this on the understanding that Mrs Hamiltton agrees to repay the full
amount (£36,444.89).

Any decision in respect of whether we accept this would need to be made by Dave Pardoe.

Counsel defending has offered pleas to false accounting in this matter [I presume counts 2-9 inclusive]
and asked me to take instructions as to whether this might be an appropriate offer. My view is that
there is evidence she has taken the money, and that there is sufficient evidence to support theft, but
Royal Mail may be content with guilty pleas to dishonesty matters if she undertook to repay the

amount of the shortage at audit, ie £36,644.89. It might be worth speaking to the officers, Graham
Brander and Colin Price, to canvass their views.
