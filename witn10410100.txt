                                                                                   WITN10410100




3.     1976 to 1979, self employed as a subpostmaster managing a small retail shop

and SubPost Office.

4.     1979 to 1982, employed by the Post Office as a counter clerk, serving

members of the public with the full range of Post Office services.

5.     1982 to 1984, promoted to manager of Hartlepool Branch Post Office,

managing and supervising counter clerks, who were responsible for serving

members of the public.

6.     1984 to 1987, became manager of Counter Remitting Unit, Middlesbrough.

Responsible for staff management, overseeing the preparation of cash and stock for

delivery to Post Offices within the Post Office network in the Teesside, North

Yorkshire and County Durham area.

7.     1987 to 1990, Audit Manager, responsible for a small team, conducting cash

and stock audits of Post Offices, both Sub Post Offices and directly managed Branch

Post Offices in the Teesside, North Yorkshire and County Durham areas.

8.     1990 to 1993 I was promoted to District Audit Manager for the Newcastle

upon Tyne District. I was responsible for managing all District Audit Teams,

preparing annual audit programme liaising with retail network managers and security

managers

9.     1993 to 1995, following a Post Office reorganisation, I became Security and

Investigation Manager, based in Leeds responsible for the north east area of

England. I would advise on physical security and givae security advice.

10.    1996 to 2003 (January), a vacancy for an investigation manager arose, the

existing manager having transferred to Royal Mail. At this time, following the

disbanding of the Post Office Investigation Department (POID), almost all

investigators were ex-POID; there was nobody suitably qualified to fill the vacancy. I

                                                                                         WI TN10410100
                                                                                        WITN10410100




was asked if, subject to achieving the required standard, I would be interested in

filling the vacancy. I agreed. I believe I was the first person to be recruited as an

investigator, since the disbanding of POID. To ensure my suitability, I was

interviewed by the former head of POID and then a psychiatrist, for a psychiatric

evaluation.

11.    No formal training courses were available at this time so it was arranged for

special training to be delivered by the training team at Security and Investig\tion

Service (SIS), Impact House, Croydon. The course programme lasted several

weeks and covered; investigation techniques, interview techniques, interviews under

caution, compliance with PACE 1984, interviews of witnesses, taking witness

statements, search awareness, report writing, preparation of prosecution files,

reference to legislation regarding dishonesty (Theft Act 1968). The course was partly

classroom based, but also included the opportunities to shadow established

investigators, as an observer, eventually opening the interview, following the

progress of the cases from beginning to end_ This training was periodically

reinforced with refresher training, for the investigation community. Once trained I

was mentored and shadowed by an experienced investigator who assessed my

suitability and performance. At times I would sit in on interviews, as an observer, at

the end of the interview I would give feedback to the interviewer.

12.    As a team we held monthly meetings to discuss new legislation, work load,

case development, training and other issues arising from investigation work. The

team members would also attend periodic training arranged by the central Security

and Investigation Team_ Training topics covered; Investigation Awareness,

InvestigationTechniques standard and advanced, Search Awareness, Audit and

Investigator (Horizon). Periodic team leader meetings were held.

                                                                                       WITN10410100




13.   In 2000, following the retirement of the two officers involved with

investigations in Scotland and Northern Ireland, I became responsible for Scotland

and Northern Ireland. I also had a limited involvement with Post Offices in the north

east of England.

SECURITY and INVESTIGATION MANAGER ROLE

14.   I managed a team of four investigation managers, one based in Newcastle

upon Tyne, two based in Scotland, Glasgow and Perth and one based in Belfast,

Northern Ireland.

15.    The rules regarding case management and preparation had recently changed

in Northern Ireland, prior to 2001 investigation cases in Northern Ireland were

forwarded directly to the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Post Office was classed

as a statutory corporation and investigation cases could be submitted directly to the

Director of Public Prosecutions. Following a change of status in 2001 PO Counters

became POLtd, a public limited company, and no longer recognized as a public

corporation, a consequence of this change was that for prosecution advice all cases

had to be submitted to the respective PSNI district rather than directly to the DPP.

Investigations within Northern Ireland were submitted to the relevant Police Service

of Northern Ireland district where the alleged offence took place. The PSNI would

then advise whether they considered the case had merit, assess the evidence and

prepare a prosecution file, if considered appropriate, for submission to the Public

Prosecution Service NI. The Post Office investigation manager would be actively

involved in assisting PSNI officers to progress the case, providing information,

evidence as required. There was a steep learning curve for Suzanne Winter,

investigation manager, and myself as there were no formal training courses

available. Progressing cases at first was difficult as the PSNI was not used to



                                           4
                                                                                        WI TN10410100
                                                                                      WITN10410100




dealing with Post Office accounting cases. After a number of meetings with PSNI

officers a process was developed. Suzanne Winter became the primary contact

between PSNI and the Post Office.

16.    On a day to day basis I would discuss casework progress with each

investigation manager. Where information, regarding accounting or other

irregularities, was received, the case would be allocated to an investigation manager

who would assess the facts of the case, collect any evidence. I would discuss the

facts of the case with the respective investigation manager. Once evidence was

collected and the merits of the allegations assessed an initial decision would be

made as to whether the case could be dealt with as a disciplinary matter or

forwarded for prosecution advice. Where it was decided that the matter could be

dealt with as a disciplinary issue the circumstances would be discussed with the

respective retail network manager. They would be responsible for any disciplinary

action required and progressing a claim to recover funds, if necessary.

17.    In circumstances where criminality was suspected, a casefile would be raised

and the case allocated to a named investigation manager. Investigators in the Team

were Raymond Grant (Perth), Shirley Stockdale (Glasgow), both very experienced

investigators, Shirley Stockdale was ex-police, Suzanne Winter (Belfast) highly

trained and experienced investigator, Tony Robertson (Newcastle upon Tyne) least

experienced investigator, whose performance was regularly monitored. The

investigation manager would liaise with other departments, where necessary, to

request further information. Most common departments involved would be Post

Office Audit (irregularities identified during a routine audit), the Department for Works

and Pensions, (Pension and Allowance irregularities), Department of Works and
                                                                                          WI TN10410100
                                                                                      WITN10410100




Pensions Investigators (assist in investigating allegations made directly to DWP

Investigators), National Savings, Girobank, (suppression of Girobank inpayments) .

18.    Information regarding the alleged irregularities would be gathered, usually

from external sources, from retail network managers, from auditors. At the time of

my involvement it was not common practice to contact Horizon. Permission where

necessary would be requested, from the respective departments to intercept

pouches (paid pensions and allowances), or document envelopes, containing

transaction documents, for local scrutiny. The most common documents intercepted

were paid pension and allowance vouchers. These documents would be checked,

locally, by an investigation manager and investigation team support staff. The

investigation manager would prepare a schedule of all identified irregularities.

SPECIAL AUDIT or SCHEDULED AUDIT

19.    Where the pattern of irregularities suggested deliberate action, rather than

error, then the district audit manager would be contacted and a special audit of the

accounts of the Post Office under suspicion requested. Special investigation audits

were arranged for a Thursday morning, this being the day following the declared

weekly balance. On arrival at the office the office staff would collect the auditor and

investigators pass card and contact the Helpline to validate the identity of both

auditors and investigators. On initial entry the investigation manager would

introduce themselves and explain why the audit had been arranged. The

investigator would further explain that following the audit the Subpostmaster or staff

from a directly managed branch office would be invited to attend a formal interview,

under caution. They would also be advised that they could take legal advice

regarding the interview and have a legal representative or friend,usually a federation

representative or union representative, present during the interview.

                                                                                         WITN10410100




20.    Where accounting discrepancies were identified during a scheduled audit, the

first point of contact by the auditors, would usually be the respective retail network

manager. The retail network manager (RNM) would decide upon a course of action

which may or not involve the investigation team. Where the RNM decided to deal

with the matter as a disciplinary issue they would be responsible for pursuing any

recovery of funds. In cases where criminality was suspected the retail network

manager would usually contact the investigation team, for advice and or action. If

necessary a formal interview, under caution, would be arranged. Based on the facts

of the case and the evidence available as team leader, I would decide whether to

submit the case for prosecution advice, England, Post Office Legal Services if

prosecution was advised I would discuss it with my line manager. In Scotland and

Northern Ireland cases were referred to the Procurator Fiscal who would decide on

what action to take without further consultation with the Post Office Ltd managers. In

Northern Ireland cases were submitted, initially, to the Police Service of Northern

Ireland and ultimately to the Public Prosecution Service NI. Post Office Ltd had no

control or input into decisions to prosecute or not. The case could be returned to

the RNM for disciplinary action, I do not know what process an RNM would follow.

INTERVIEWS AND INVESTIGATIONS

21.    Being a small team, as team leader, I was actively involved with the interviews

of those accused of alleged criminal offences. I would conduct interviews as the

lead investigator but I would also take part in interviews as a second officer. All of

the team were experienced at conducting suspect offender interviews. I cannot be

certain as to how many interviews each investigator had conducted but on average it

would have been between one and two a month. Personally I have conducted in

excess of one hundred suspect offender interviews, I cannot be specific about the
                                                                                         WI TN10410100
                                                                                      WITN10410100




actual number The circumstances and location of the case would dictate which role I

would follow.

22.    Investigation interviews, in England, were recorded on tape. In Scotland and

Northern Ireland up until 2001 all interviews were recorded in writing, as Notes of

Interview. From mid 2001 authority was given to record all interviews in Scotland and

Northern Ireland on tape.

23     All investigations and interviews in England were conducted under the rules

set out in PACE 1984. In Northern Ireland all investigations and interviews followed

the rules set out in P&CE Order Northern Ireland 1989. In Scotland all investigations

and interviews were conducted under the rules of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland)

Act 1995.

PROSECUTION FILE

24.    Once an investigation was completed, a decision would be made as to how

the matter would be dealt with either as a discipline issue, actioned by the RNM or

be submitted to the appropriate authority for prosecution advice, (Post Office Legal

Service, England) (Procurator Fiscal, Scotland), (Police Service of Northern Ireland

who would forwarded it to Public Prosecution Service NI) for advice on prosecution.

The lead investigator in each case would be responsible for preparing the

prosecution file, gathering the evidence, collecting witness statements, collating all

relevant material and preparing a disclosure file. Being a small team each

investigator would be responsible for preparing the prosecution file and listing a

schedule of unused material. As team leader I would oversee prosecution case

preparation. The case papers would in England, be submitted to Post Office Legal

Services for advice and the sufficiency of evidence.

25.    Investigation in Scotland case files were submitted to one of 49 area

Procurator Fiscals, responsible for the location where the alleged offence took place.

The Procurator Fiscal would assess the evidence, request additional evidence,

where necessary, and make a decision as to whether to prosecute and charge the

suspect offender. Investigations and submission for prosecution, to the respective

Procurator Fiscal, were the responsibility of myself, Raymond Grant, (Perth), or

Shirley Stockdale, (Glasgow).

26.    In Scotland and Northern Ireland the decision to prosecute, and the charge,

was made by the Procurator Fiscal, Scotland and Public Prosecution Service,

Northern Ireland, respectively. Post Office Ltd investigators, other than providing

evidence and support, had no input in the prosecution decision. The decision as to

the charge would be that of the PF (Scotland) or PPS, NI, (Northern Ireland)

27.    Suzanne Winter (Belfast) was the investigation manager responsible for

investigations in Northern Ireland, and all submissions and liaison with the PSNI.

28.    I was not involved in disciplinary matters for either Subpostmaster, their staff

or Branch Office staff. The retail network manager responsible for the outlet, under

investigation, would be informed of the outcome of the audit and any subsequent

investigation. Based on the evidence presented, the retail network manager would

decide upon whatever course of action they considered appropriate.

29.    Regarding the recovery of funds through litigation, I was not involved, it was

dealt with centrally by a department within the central Security and Investigation

team. I had no direct dealings with civil litigation.

30.    1 cannot comment on many of the policy changes which came into force after

January 2003, as I was no longer employed by Post Office Counters Ltd.

HORIZON

31.    During 1999 Post Office Ltd began a programme to install a computerised

accounting system into Post Offices, the system is called Horizon. At this time the

Horizon system was being introduced into Sub-Post Offices, Branch Offices used a

different computerised accounting system ECCO, I cannot recall what the initials

ECCO stand for. The Horizon installation programme was such that investigations

could involve Horizon, or the paper based accounting system (being phased out by

Horizon) or the Branch Office ECCO system. In the limited time that I was involved

with Horizon I had no knowledge of any problems with the accuracy of the Horizon

system.

PROSECUTION of ALAN McLOUGHLIN

32.    In respect of the prosecution of ALAN McLOUGHLIN I can confirm; that I have

limited knowledge of this case, apart from an entry in my official notebook "see

WITN10410101" and recent sight of the tape transcript. The case was initiated by a

report from the Paid Order Unit Lisahally, Northern Ireland, regarding overclaims in

the paid pension and allowance foils submitted by Brookfield SPSO. The normal

procedure in cases of this type would be to allocate it to an investigation manager

who would arrange to intercept the paid pension and allowances and check them

locally. A schedule would be prepared listing any irregularities identified. The

checking and preparation of the schedule would have been undertaken by Suzanne

Winter, investigation manager, Belfast and support staff, if available. A significant

number of irregularities were identified suggesting that they were not the result of

error but deliberate action.

33.       Once a pattern was established, a special audit of Brookfield SPSO was

arranged. I accompanied Suzanne Winter, investigator, and members of a Post

                                                                                       WITN10410100




Office network audit team to Brookfield SPSO, Belfast on Thursday 26/07/2001. At

this audit and subsequent interview I assisted Suzanne Winter as second officer.

The audit and subsequent interview had been arranged following a number of

irregularities, being identified in the value of paid Pension and Allowance claimed in

the accounts of Brookfield Sub Post Office. During the audit the paid pension and

allowance foils on hand were checked, errors were found. Some Pension and

Allowance foils were listed but no actual foils were present_ At the conclusion of the

audit Alan McLoughlin was invited to attend a formal interview with Suzanne Winter

and myself. Alan McLoughlin was advised of his legal rights and formally cautioned.

He declined the presence of a solicitor or access to legal advice. He requested the

presence of his mother Margaret McLoughlin, as a friend, she attended the interview.

34.    During the course of the interview Alan McLoughlin made admissions that for

a period of about seven months he had been altering the cash on hand figure

recorded in the Post Office accounts to show acceptable discrepancies. He further

admitted that he had allowed errors in the value of paid pensions and allowances to

be submitted without correction, to help the account. At the conclusion of the

interview Alan McLoughlin was suspended from duty by Aiden McNeill, Retail

Network Manager. Having read the tape transcripts of the interview with Alan

McLoughlin he briefly mentioned Horizon but did not suggest or have concerns about

the reliability of the Horizon system which could have contributed to the accounting

irregularities identified. The discrepancies identified as part of the investigation could

not be attributed to failings of the Horizon system. He admitted that pension and

allowance irregularities went unchecked and also admitted that he adjusted the cash

on hand figure, in the Post Office account, to show an acceptable balance.

35.    It would have been normal procedure for me to liaise with Suzanne Winter

regarding the preparation of this case and the subsequent transfer of all case

material and disclosures to the PSNI. Based on their assessment of the evidence

the PSNI would submit the case to Public Prosecution Service NI for a prosecution

decision. I have had no contact with Alan McLoughlin since the date of the interview,

26/07/2001. PSNI had not progressed this case prior to my leaving the Post Office

service, in January 2003. However, I have now seen documents relating to the

conviction and subsequent appeal of Alan McLoughlin.

36.    Brookfield SPSO was one of the first offices in Northern Ireland, to have the

Horizon system installed, September 1999. At this time, or prior to the investigation

of accounting irregularities at Brookfield, was I not aware of any problems with the

operation of Horizon.

37.    Alan McLoughlin's application to the Court of Appeal cites the Horizon system

as being at fault by generating errors. During the interview Mr McLoughlin admitted

falsifying the Post Office accounts by not correcting pension and allowance errors

and adjusting the cash on hand figure to show an acceptable balance. He made

only a brief reference to the Horizon system but did not suggest that the system was

in any way responsible for the errors identified.

PROSECUTION of MAUREEN McKELVEY

38.    In respect of the prosecution of MAUREEN McKELVEY I can confirm; that I

have limited knowledge of this case. By reference to an entry in my official notebook

"see WITN1041002", made on the day of the interview, 04/04/2002, with Maureen

McKelvey. I accompanied Suzanne Winter, investigation manager, and members of a

Post Office network audit team to Clanabogan SPSO, Omagh. The audit and

subsequent interview had been arranged following a number of irregularities,

Pension and Allowance overclaims, being identified in the accounts of Clanabogan

Sub Post Office, Omagh. Mrs MCKelvey was advised that following the audit she

would be invited to attend a formal interview, under caution, she was further advised

of her legal rights. Mrs McKelvey contacted her solicitor at Patrick Fahy and Co,

Omagh arrangements were made to hold the interview in the offices of Patrick Fahy

at 11:00 on Thursday 04/04/2002. Mrs McKelvey's solicitor, Steven Atherton, was

present during the interview. Mrs McKelvey made no admissions. A second

interview with Maureen McKelvey was held in the presence of her solicitor, Steven

Atherton, on the 27/05/2002. Maureen McKelvey, made no admissions.

39.    I have now seen case papers relating to this case but not the interview tape

transcripts. By reference to the case papers I noted that Suzanne Winter arranged

for a pouch containing paid Pension and Allowance foils to be opened and checked

in the presence of Mrs McKelvey and her solicitor Steven Atherton. Errors similar to

those identified during the investigation were identified.

40.     It would have been normal procedure for me to liaise with Suzanne Winter

regarding the preparation of this case and its subsequent transfer to the PSNI. I had

no further contact with Maureen McKelvey. PSNI had not progressed this case prior

to my leaving the Post Office service. However, I have now seen documents

regarding the prosecution of Maureen McKelvey. I had no involvement in the

prosecution process; all action was taken by the PSNI, with assistance from Post

Office investigation manager Suzanne Winter in the prosecution of Maureen

McKelvey.
