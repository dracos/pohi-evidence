APPENDIX D RULES FOR THE PI.

1.0 Introduction

1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this document is to define the process for Problem Management of the POA
environment. For the purpose of this document a Problem is defined as:

“The unknown underlying cause of one or more Incidents.”

1.2 Objectives

The primary goal of the Problem Management process is to minimise the adverse effect on the
business of Incidents and Problems caused by errors in the PO environment, and to proactively
prevent the recurrence of Incidents, Problems and errors. Problem Management focuses on
finding the root cause of Incidents, creating Known Errors and resolving these via the Change
Management process.

1.3 Process Owner

The owner of this process is the Service Delivery Team Manager. Responsibility for individual
problems is allocated to the specific Service Delivery Manager most affected by the problem,
who will act thereafter as the Problem Manager. The table in Appendix A shows the current
scope of each Service Delivery Manager’s responsibility. Where a problem spans several
services, and relates to the customer view of the service, the Problem Manager will be the
Service Delivery Team Manager. If there is no immediately obvious Service Delivery Manager
to manage a Problem, then the Service Delivery Team Manager will nominate the individual.

2. Scope

2.1. General

The process covers both the reactive and proactive functions of Problem Management.

The scope of the reactive function is from identification of a Problem to its closure and
includes root cause analysis, initiation of change requests and the provision of management
information to Fujitsu and POL. Note that a problem may be closed without being resolved,
where the resolution is judged not to be cost effective.

The scope of proactive Problem Management includes trend analysis, subsequent identification
and resolution of Problems and management of the Problem Management process itself.

Care needs to be taken within POA to distinguish a “Problem” from a “Major Incident”, since
old procedures controlled Major Incidents by defining them as Problems. Every Major
Incident will have a Problem record raised for it but this is only to ensure that the underlying

cause of the incident is thoroughly aired and any recommendations from the Major Incident
report applied over time. Problems are handled essentially off-line and may take many days to
resolve. Incidents are handled quickly, the aim being to restore the customer’s service as soon
as possible.

2.2 Inputs
The inputs to this process are:

© Problem record initiated by the Service Desk following identification that no record exists
on the Knowledge datastore (KEL) for the specific circumstances associated with an
incident.

e Problem record raised by the Service Delivery Manager as the result of a direct request
from POL e.g. during monthly reviews or on the telephone. Note that the problem
management process interface for POL raised problems is covered in ref [1] .

¢ Problem record raised by the Service Delivery Manager as the result of a direct request
from an SDU, apart from Service Desk, who have noticed a trend which needs
investigation.

© Statistics for trend analysis

e Request for management information from Problem records

¢ Outputs from performance metrics where, for example, the SLT is at risk.

2.3, Outputs

The outputs from this process are:

A closed Problem

An entry in the KEL

A workaround

A permanent solution where commercially feasible

Contribution to a Continuous Service Improvement Plan (CSIP)
A CP and business case for proposal

A Problem referred to POL or a third party

An available Service or Component

Analysis of a trend report and recommendations for proactive change
Management Information

Proactive feedback and advice to users

Other proactive actions to reduce the number of Incidents

eoerereec ee ece ee

2.4 Control Mechanisms
The measures that apply to this service are:

e¢ Number and impact of similar Incidents occurring after a Problem is recorded before a
resolution or workaround is available

¢ Total number of Incidents reported to the Service Desk

¢ Caseload of Problem Managers.

¢ No of Problems by SDU, service and application

2.5 Service Hours

Although a problem may be identified at any time, the management of problems is essentially
conducted during office hours i.e. 09:00 to 17:30 Monday to Friday excluding Bank Holidays.

s and Dependencies

3.1 Risks

The following define the risks to the successful delivery of the process:

e Break in the communications chain to third parties. Mitigation is to invoke escalation
procedures

e Resistance by parties to carry out pro-active recommendations to reduce number of
Incidents. Mitigation is to escalate to senior management

¢ Commercial constraints. These would need to be analysed on an individual basis to decide
on the most commercially acceptable option

e Increased business and operational impact through lack of Problem progress updates to

POL.

Unavailability of sufficient support unit staff

Unavailability of sufficient tools for problem diagnosis

Non-availability of KEL or call management systems

The provision of inadequate staff training

Unavailability of systems for evidence gathering

Loss of any infrastructure component which links support systems to the live estate

eoceceee

3.2. Dependencies
This process is dependent on:

e Effective routing of Problems to SDUs and third parties

e Effective escalation procedures within Fujitsu, POL and third parties

e POL acceptance of feedback, contributing to end user education and reduced Incident
rates

e Effective collaboration diagnosis between SDU’s and third parties

4.2 Level 2 Problem Management Processes

4.2.1 Step 1a: Problems initiated from incident management
Responsible: Service Desk(IMT) and Problem Initiator (PI)

An incident is raised and there is no KEL entry for the symptoms. It is
sent to an SDU for root cause analysis. Multiple occurrences of the
incident start to occur. A call is raised against which to link all further
occurrences of the call : the Master FAD call (Detailed incident
Management procedures)

1

IMT alert Problem Initiator to existence of potential problem. N.B.
Chronologically this should occur when the call is sent to the SDU. In
practice where there are a number of calls being received on this
particular topic, the master FAD call may be raised before the problem
is alerted. There is no dependency between the Incident and Problem
Management processes. The call will be alerted as a potential
problem as soon as possible but it is the resolution of the incident
which takes priority.

Go to
Step 2

This section is not part of the Problem Management Process. It is part of the detailed
Procedures associated with the Incident Management Process. It is included to link the two

processes.

Step 2 Step 2

Steps
1.1 A Problem may be initiated by the following:

e The Problem Initiator (PI) noting that a multiple Incident has occurred.
e The IMT noting that there is no KEL entry to cover the specific
circumstances of an incident and alerting the PI

e The Service Delivery Units may identify Problems, from either noting that a

multiple Incident has occurred or that the root cause of an Incident is
required, following the restoration of a service after applying a temporary
workaround.

e Problems may be identified following an analysis of trends by SDUs, the

Service Desk, Service Delivery Managers etc., which require the underlying

cause to be found.
e Either POL or Fujitsu Service Management may become or be made aware
of situations which identify a Problem.
Tf contacted by the IMT, the PI will use the Rules to determine whether it is
appropriate to raise a problem. If in doubt the PI should contact the Service
Delivery Manager and request approval to raise a Problem by telephone. On

receipt of approval or when the issue conforms to the rules for Problem raising, the
Problem Initiator will raise a Problem record.

If POL wish a problem to be raised, they will discuss initiation with the Service
Delivery Manager and on acceptance of the problem, the Service Delivery
Manager will raise a Problem record and notify the PI that they have done so.
Alternatively they may contact the PI and request them to raise it on their behalf. .

If the SDU (including 3" party suppliers) wish to raise a problem, they will discuss it
with the appropriate Service Delivery Manager, who will create the Problem
record on their behalf or ensure that the PI does so.

Note that care needs to be taken on the definition of a problem and its title, as this will
be crucial in determining further occurrences of it. For example, ifa series of
branches have a problem where SLT targets for breakfix are exceeded due to poor
quality spares, it is important that the incident is identified as being a problem with
the SPARES not with BRANCHES failing SLT targets for speed of turnaround.

Note also that the Problem Initiator is normally co-located with the IMT team. In the
event of the PI’s illness or absence, that role will be performed someone from the
CS Administration team.

The Problem is classified by assigning a severity level according to urgency and
impact. While the Incident is open, the severity will match that of the Incident.
However, if the Problem has been raised to provide the underlying cause of an
Incident to which a temporary workaround has been applied, the severity may
be lower. Note also that “MBCTI” and “Major Incident” relate to classifications
of incidents. However they are included here, as such incidents should always
generate an examination of root cause and determination of action to prevent
recurrence.

Note that once a problem reference has been generated and is available to
attach to, HSD should attach the Master FAD call to the Problem record.
Further occurrences should continue to be attached to the Master FAD call.

There is no target for the creation of the Problem Record, attachment of the Master
FAD call to the Problem record. However it is expected that all the steps will be
completed within one working day of the problem record being created.

Severity I Importance I Definition

MBCI e System outage which prevents the supply of one or more
services to a number of post offices

Major e A system outage which has the potential, if not resolved, to

Incident lead to an MBCI

A Critical e BUSINESS STOPPED, a Post Office down, unable to
process any business.

B Major e BUSINESS RESTRICTED, a Post Office restricted in its
ability to transact business, e.g. one counter down.

Cc Medium e NON-CRITICAL, a Post Office working normally but with a
known disability, e.g. an interim solution (workaround) has
been provided.

D Low e INTERNAL, an internal HSD/SMC problem, e.g. a help desk

PC or a phone set inoperable.

Note that neither MBCI nor Major incident is reflected in Powerhelp or PEAK. Such a status
is simply the trigger for the process steps outlined in ref [5]

Problems identified outside normal office hours

The PI only provides the service 09:00 to 17:30. Any potential problems identified outside
those hours should be communicated to the PI or the SDM at the earliest possible time i.e. the
next working day.

4.2.2 Step 2: Problem Investigation and Diagnosis
Responsible: Service Delivery Managers, SDU’s, POL, third parties

From
Step 1

SDM Collects Business Impact of Problem, consulting POL,as
appropriate
SDM decides what alert triggers he/she wants and updates KEL
(Frequency provided by IMT attaching new occurrences to the Master
FAD call)

SDUs collect technical data on problem and perform root cause
analysis. This may be at the explicit request of the SDM or on their
own initiative. The SDM monitors progress on PEAK.

1

SDUs and other parties diagnose root cause and define outline
resolution

l

Go to
Step 3

Steps

2.1 The SDM identifies the initial business impact of the problem and decides what he wants
as triggers for alerting. For example, for one problem he might want to know as soon as
there was a recurrence. With another, he might only want to be notified when there were
12 in one day. The SDM should update the KEL to provide this information for the IMT.
Note that if this information is not provided, the IMT will not notify any surge in incident
occurrence. Note also that the business impact may change over time if more incidents
occur, as a direct result of the underlying problem not being fixed. IMT will continue to
link any new occurrences to the Master FAD call, as they occur. They will also contact
the PI, if the triggers set by the SDM on the KEL are tripped. The SDM will consult POL
as appropriate. In some cases, this may not be necessary (the business impact of an MBCI
is to some extent pre-determined). However the SDM should always consult POL, where
the problem has an impact on the daily working practices of Post-masters or relates to a
“Problem Branch”.

Business impact is measured against the following parameters:
e Total number of incident calls associated with the problem

e¢ Whether the problem is disabling a specific outlet or preventing it from trading and
whether there are alternatives to that branch in the locality.

e Whether the problem is disabling a high performance outlet or preventing it from
trading

e Whether the problem is disabling a nation-wide service or affecting a specific
service over a distinct geographical area

e Whether there is a workaround, which enables the Post Master to circumvent the
problem without affecting his business flow. Note that the workaround must be
acceptable to the Post Master. In this context, a workaround, which disables the
counter for 5 minutes, is unlikely to be acceptable

e Whether the problem is likely to bring POL HQ into disrepute e.g. articles in the
Press, Postmaster has contacted M.P.

Note that the above parameters are intended to provide RELATIVE Business impact. It is not
intended to imply that a single disabled outlet, where there are alternatives, can be left disabled
indefinitely. Business Impact is defined in more detail in Appendix C

2.2 Details of the Problem are gathered by the responsible SDU or third party from wherever
is relevant, e.g. Incident Management, the person logging the Incident, the CMDB, other
SDUs. The information is then used to diagnose the problem and find the root cause. If
difficulties are encountered, the SDU escalates the issue to the SDM. The work done to
establish root cause may be performed at the explicit request of the SDM, in which case,
updates may be applied directly to the Problem record by the SDM. It may also be
performed on their own initiative by the SDU, because for example, they need the
information to resolve the incident. The SDM will monitor the PEAK system to view
progress and summarise the information on the problem record on Powerhelp.

2.3 From this investigation the SDU decides what would be required for a permanent
resolution, including the following information:

© Root cause analysis of the problem
© One or more permanent resolutions to the problem

¢ Outline indications of the resource required for each resolution option,
which may be expressed in financial terms or human resource terms but
should be readily convertible to financial impact.

e Impact on the SDU to resolve the problem

e Estimated impact on the user: Note that this is not a duplicate of the
business impact already collected. It provides a technical view of what the
user will be able or unable to do.

e Estimated impact on operations

Company-in-Confidence Date: 29/07/05

e Risk of applying resolution to problem (risks identified for each option, if
there are more than one)

© Cost of not-resolving a problem
¢ Cost of conformance as opposed to non-conformance

¢ Suggested best time for implementation: e.g. in relation to releases or
operational exercises already planned with which this change could
coincide. With application code, this will always be a Release reference.

e Any other relevant information e.g. this component becomes redundant in
six months time, therefore less incentive in fixing problem.

Note that it is possible for a problem to be resolved without going through a formal process of
agreement to resolve e.g. root cause analysis is quickly established, resolution is clear and
simple, business impact is severe and a testing environment is immediately available for the
resolution to be tested. In such cases, there is no need for the SDM to do more than record
this on the Problem record.

2.4. Subject to the above, the SDM will make an assessment, which will cover the
following areas:

¢ Severity and Business impact of the problem

© Cost of the resolution

¢ Risk of the technical solution

e Impact if any on POA implementation programmes

e If relevant, long term viability of the solution e.g component shortly to
become redundant.

e Whether the problem needs to be fixed immediately or in the medium to
long term.

3.1 At this point, the SDM decides whether or not he believes the problem must be

resolved. He should take into account the business impact and in particular any
input provided by POL PM. POL PM should always be consulted where the
SDM’s judgement is that the problem needs to be resolved but should be
deferred to the next major release rather than being resolved immediately.

e The problem is entirely release independent and can be financed entirely
by Customer Services.

e The resolution of the problem requires financing by POL
e The problem requires action by POL to resolve it.

The SDM may also identify at this point, that the proposal needs the explicit
support of senior management within Customer Services. The following list is
not exhaustive but indicates where escalation is appropriate:

¢ Resolution of the problem requires capital expenditure to be allocated
e Resolution of the problem may require a delay to a release

e POL have requested urgent resolution to a problem, but indications are that
the resolution cannot be fitted into the next release

¢ POL have requested resolution of a problem but the SDM’s judgement is
that the resolution is not cost effective

e Significant investment by POL is required to resolve a problem, there is
evidence that they are unlikely to approve it and there is a knock-on effect
on POA Operations

The SDM will prepare a formal assessment of the problem, including the elements
defined at Paragraph 2.3.and pass the problem to the Service Delivery Team
Manager, who will submit it to the Problem Review Board, whose Terms of
reference are described in Appendix B. They will decide on the most appropriate
action. In addition to the above, this may include tabling the problem at the SRF
for further high-level discussion with POL.

If the SDM has a problem which requires urgent resolution and where expenditure
will need to be authorised by the Problem Review Board, he/she should escalate to
the Service Delivery Team Manager and he/she will make a decision on whether it
is appropriate to convene a special meeting of the Problem Review Board to
discuss the issue.

Steps

4.1 SDM contacts the originator of the problem and lets them know their decision (or the
Problem Review Board’s decision if it has been escalated). It is possible that this will result in
the discovery of information, which would make it more important to resolve the problem. In
such a case, the SDM may either decide to go ahead with the resolution based on the new
evidence or re-submit it to the PRB, if it was their decision not to proceed with it.

4.2 The problem will become dormant, i.e. it will be monitored but no active steps will be
taken to resolve it. The following events need to take place, before the SDM can leave it:

e Ifthe problem is also registered on the PEAK system as an error, the SDM will ensure
that the PEAK record has been updated with a progress indicating that the problem
record is now only being monitored. . No other updates should be made on the subject
of resolving it.

e The SDM will decide what frequency of incidents will cause the dormant problem to
be re-activated and ensure that this is documented on the KEL record. This is expected
to vary widely from problem to problem.

New incidents, which are occurrences of the problem will be attached to the Master FAD call
as they occur and before being closed.

4.3 Before each major release the problem will be examined to determine if it is no longer
relevant. If there are no major releases within a year, the problem should be examined at least
quarterly and assessed for closure.

Steps

4.1 SDM contacts POL Problem Manager and discusses with them the relative importance of
business impact over cost justification. If POL Problem Manager does not agree to let the
problem go unresolved, the SDM should refer it to the Problem Review Board.

4.2 Providing that POL Problem Manager agrees, the problem will become dormant ie. it will
be monitored only. No active steps will be taken to resolve it

The following events need to take place, before the SDM can leave it:

e Ifthe problem is also registered on the PEAK system, the SDM will ensure that the
PEAK record has been updated with a progress indicating that the problem record is
now dormant. No other updates should be made on the subject of resolving it.

© The SDM will decide what frequency of incidents will cause the dormant problem to

Company-in-Confidence Date: 29/07/05

Steps

4.1 If the resolution requires a change in the fundamental design of the software or the
introduction of new hardware/software/ functionality, a CP will be required. The SDM
should prepare and sponsor the CP on behalf of Customer Services , using the
information already collected.

4.2. The SDM will liaise with the Service Introduction Manager to ensure that the
resolution is included in the next release and supply him/her with all the necessary data
on the business impact of the issue. Issues associated with inclusion of the resolution in
the next release should be escalated to the Problem Review Board.

4.3 The SDM is responsible for a list of problems, relating to his/her area of
responsibility. This list should include the business impact for each problem and the
release to which it is attached. The Problem Manager has the responsibility of ensuring
that the Service Introduction Manager has access to the list.

4.4 It is the responsibility of the Service Introduction Manager to alert the SDM’s to
any potential issues with the resolution of problems being taken out of releases
Subject to the agreement of the specific SDM, the Service Introduction Manager may
negotiate on his/her behalf on the inclusion or otherwise in a release. It remains the
responsibility of the SDM to ensure that the resolution to a particular problem is
included in a release, if that is the business requirement.

4.5 It is the responsibility of the SDM to:

e Record on the Problem database, which release the resolution has been
allocated to

e Ensure that the Service Introduction Manager for that specific release is aware
that a new problem resolution has been included in the release by the
development team.

N.B. Where a problem with application code is a “late entrant” to a release, it is possible that a
later release will already be in preparation and therefore the Service Introduction Manager for
the later release will have to be notified too.

4.6 The progression and implementation of the change will follow the normal Change
Management and Release Management Processes.

4.7 While development is pending, the problem record will stay open. Any further
occurrences of the problem reported as incidents, should be linked to the Master
FAD call by the IMT before they are closed, so as to keep a frequency record.

4.8 When the resolution is implemented, the following tasks will be performed:

e KEL record will be amended to record that a resolution of the problem is
being implemented and the expected completion date of the
implementation.

e The originator of the problem (unless it has been originated by IMT) is
informed that a resolution to the problem has been implemented

e The problem record is updated to show that a resolution to the problem
has been implemented.

e An estimate is made by the SDM as to how long a problem record should
remain open before being permanently closed. As a general rule this will
be three months after the resolution has been applied. In cases where the
problem relates to a specific event e.g change of time-zones or resilience
in the event of high order comms failure due to poor weather, it may be
necessary to leave the problem open longer. It is also open to the SDM to
decide that the problem can be closed earlier.

Steps

4.1 If the resolution specifically relates to a software fault, the SDM will liaise with
the Release Management Forum to ensure that the resolution is included in the
next R release. It is expected that this will be via the SSC Team Manager, who
will present the business impact provided by the SDM to the RMF. Where the
SDM wishes to do so, they may attend the RMF in person. The SDM’s will be on
the circulation list for RMF minutes. Issues associated with inclusion of the
resolution in the next R release should be escalated to the Problem Review
Board.

4.3 If the resolution requires a change in the fundamental design of the software or the
introduction of new hardware/software/ functionality, a CP will be required. The
SDM should initiate the CP on behalf of Customer Services, using the information
already collected.

4.4 While development is pending, the problem record will stay open. Any further
occurrences of the problem reported as incidents, should be linked to the Master
FAD call before being closed, so as to keep a frequency record.

4.5 Development and implementation of the resolution will follow the Release
Management Process. The Release Manager should escalate to the relevant SDM if.
there is any issue, which is likely to prevent the resolution of the problem being
delivered in expected timescales.

4.6 When the resolution is implemented, the following tasks will be performed:

e KEL record will be amended to record that a resolution of the problem is
being implemented and the expected date of completion of
implementation

¢ The originator of the problem is informed that a resolution to the problem
is being implemented

e The problem record is updated to show that a resolution to the problem is

Steps

4.1 An example of this type of issue is where the resolution is release independent but
requires testing on a test rig, which is already fully booked for testing on a major
release and therefore the testing may impact release plans. If the resolution requires a
change in the fundamental design of the software or the introduction of new
hardware/software/ functionality, a CP will be required. It is important that any issue
affecting release is aired and resolved before substantial steps are taken to implement
The SDM may prepare and sponsor the CP on behalf of Customer Services , using the
information already collected but should not submit it into PVCS until any potential
clashes for resources are resolved.

4.2. The Service Introduction Manager will broker any issues on behalf of the Problem
Manager and/or Project Manager. Prior to the CP, it may not be possible to get a
formal commitment to resolve the issue but the change should not be proceeded with
unless the issue has been informally resolved with those people who have the power to
make the resolution work. Particularly where the resolution involves out of hours
work , the person owning the human resource must be consulted to confirm that the
resolution is acceptable to them.

4.3 The SDM will liaise with the Service Introduction Manager to ensure that the
dependency is resolved and supply him/her with all the necessary data on the business
impact of the problem. Any issues associated with this should be escalated to the
Problem Review Board.

4.4 It is the responsibility of the Service Introduction Manager to alert the SDM’s to
any potential issues with the resolution of the problem. The progression and
implementation of the change will follow the normal Change Management and Release
Management Processes.

4.5 While development is pending, the problem record will stay open. Any further
occurrences of the problem reported as incidents, should be linked to the Master
FAD call by the IMT before they are closed, so as to keep a frequency record.

4.6 When the resolution is implemented, the following tasks will be performed:

e KEL record will be amended to record that a resolution of the problem is
being implemented and the expected completion date of the
implementation.

e The originator of the problem, unless originated by the PI is informed that
a resolution to the problem has been implemented

e The problem record is updated to show that a resolution to the problem
has been implemented.

e An estimate is made by the SDM as to how long a problem record should
remain open before being permanently closed. As a general rule this will
be three months after the resolution has been applied. In cases where the

Process Details
Version: 6.0

Company-in-Confidence Date: 29/07/05

Steps:

4.1 The SDM should alert the Account Manager to the issue and agree an approach to
POL. This may involve:

e Gaining agreement with the POL budget holder via the Service Review Forum
or via the SDM’s personal contacts within POL.

e Gaining agreement with the POL budget holder via the Account Manager’s
regular contacts

Note in each case, the agreement with POL at this stage is likely to be without
prejudice, and no development work should start until POL have formally confirmed
via acceptance of the CP that they are prepared to finance the work.

4.2. If POL agrees to the expenditure, the SDM should initiate any required CP on
behalf of Customer Services , using the information already collected and following
approval, the CP will be submitted to POL for an order following the standard change
management procedure.

4.3. If POL indicates that they are not prepared to finance the work, the SDM should
refer the request back to the Problem Review Board. They may decide the following:

e Request for POL to finance should be escalated

¢ The work should be financed by Fujitsu (in which case, the problem falls into
one of the preceding categories of Step 4)

e The problem should be closed ( go to step 5)

4.4 Escalation should be to Service Management Team Manager initially and thence to
Customer Services Director. On conclusion of negotiations with POL, the
following outcomes are possible:

¢ Work should be financed by Fujitsu (in which case, the problem falls into one
of the preceding categories of Step 4)

e Problem should become dormant but be monitored for its ongoing impact.

4.5. While the financing of the resolution is being discussed, occurrences of the
problem will continue to be collected by HSD and the SDM will use the ongoing data
to inform all parties on the business impact of the problem.

and the SDM will use this ongoing data to inform the discussion with POL.

4.3. If the SDM judges that the progress made by POL in resolving the problem is slow
in relation to its business impact, then the SDM should escalate the issue to the Service
Delivery Team Manager, who will bring it before the Problem Review Board.

4.4, The SDM is the primary contact point for any POL implementation plans. If any such
plans impact POA release plans, the SDM is responsible for letting the Release Manager
or the Service Introduction Manager know (depending on the nature of the impacted
change).

4.2.10Step 6: Tracking and Monitoring of Problems and Errors
Responsible: Problem Managers, Service Desk(IMT), Lead Problem Manager

The PI raises Problem records on Phoenix on the instructions of the Problem
Managers or following rules. All open Problems are clearly visible to all
Service Desk agents to enable them to check incoming Calls against existing
Problems. In the majority of cases, a frequency pattern is expected to develop.
The IMT will monitor for an increase in frequency pattern (see Step 7) . Each
problem will have a specific trigger associated with it, for alerting to the PI. If
this trigger is tripped, the PI will alert the SDM by telephone.

In the case of changes in the frequency pattern of an existing problem, the
SDM will feed the information into the business impact rating of the existing
problem as appropriate. The SDMs are however responsible for managing their
list of Problems and ensuring that they are regularly progressed.

The Service Delivery Team Manager is responsible for the overall Problem
Management process and confirming that the Problem records are properly
managed.

4.2.11Step 7: Trend Analysis
Responsible: Service Desk
Trend Analysis is performed on the statistics obtained from Call, Incident and
Problem records. Once any of the following trends are observed, the IMT will
contact the PI to alert them to the possibility of a Problem.
e Deteriorating SLA performance
¢ Deteriorating Customer Satisfaction
e Unexplained increases in Call volume
e Change in frequency pattern of incidents associated with a specific
problem

The PI will alert the SDM. If the SDM confirms that he/she would like a
Problem created, PI then creates the Problem record.
DN: Note that the SDM’s comment on this area was that the IMT are not geared to
monitor against these parameters. Initially they will only be able to monitor against
rules defined in the KEL relating to increases in call volumes or change in frequency
pattern.

To enable the Process owner to monitor the effectiveness of the process.

To enable the Process owner to monitor that changes made to improve the
effectiveness of the process have had the desired effect.

To enable the Problem Manager to prove at need to Senior management how
the process is operating.

Report List

The list of reports to be generated specifically for the Problem Management owner
each month is as follows:

e Any problems where it has been found necessary to re-open the problem after it
was supposed to be resolved. (Report should provide a nil return if none have
been raised)

e Any problems which have been the subject of customer complaints. (Report
should provide a nil return if none have been raised.)

The Problem Management owner is expected to take the information supplied and
investigate it. This is an essential step given the potential variables, since some
problems can rightly be analysed quickly and resolved, while others require significant
effort to perform root cause analysis and these differences are not readily established
by SDM or problem type. Following investigation, the Problem Manager will
determine which items are significant and forward a reduced report to Senior
Management.

DN: It is expected over time that the analysis above will lead to the development
of targets against which performance of the SDMs and the support groups in
resolving problems (as opposed to incidents) can be measured and improved.
Once these targets are in place, it will be necessary to create a reporting
mechanism which records performance against targets and also monitors the
progress of any improvement plans.

Appendix D Rules for the PI

Routine rules are as follows. Note that the PI can be asked to ignore them and raise problems
if the SDM desires:

A Problem should ALWAYS be raised by PI for an MBCI. However note that the
Problem record is intended for examination of root cause analysis, which in the case of
the MBCI is frequently established through specific meetings e.g Technical Bridge and
War Rooms. Therefore information on the Problem record will tend to be initially at
least, a summary of the root cause plus agreed actions to prevent recurrence.

A Problem should NOT be raised by PI, when there are higher than usual failures of
hardware in the branches, except at the explicit request of the Service Delivery Team
Manager. This is because there are established procedures under Availability
Management for these statistics to be evaluated.

A Problem should NOT be raised where an incident has been sent to the SDU (term
includes SSC) because the required workaround to resolve the incident can only be
performed by the SDU. Such a problem would be a duplicate.

A Problem should ALWAYS be raised where an error record (PEAK) has been sent to
a SDU for root cause analysis. (Note that there is a possibility here that a PEAK which
was sent to a SDU to establish a WORKAROUND might be mistaken for a problem.
At this stage it is still an INCIDENT. If in doubt, raise the Problem record and check
back later. If on inspection the original incident PEAK record was permanently closed
on return from the SDU (thereby closing the Powerhelp incident record) close the
problem record down. )

Problems requested by 3" parties i.e. SDU ‘s, POL should only be raised on the system
with the explicit permission of or at the request of the SDM for that service (or their
line manager)
