Importance: High

Hi Paul cc. Andrew, Katie

Please see attached responses to Named Day PQs 12263 and 12264, which have been cleared at G5 by Richard
Callard.

These are for sign off by George Freeman but we recommend Baroness Neville-Rolfe should also be sighted on the
response. Ministers should also be aware that this issue (the Horizon mediation scheme) is due to be discussed at an
adjournment debate on 29 June and also likely to feature on BBC Panorama on the same date (29 June). I’m therefore
also copying to press office.

Let me know if you need any additional background.

Thanks

Laura
