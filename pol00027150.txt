                                               Prosecutions Policy


         Purpose

         The purpose of this paper is to:

         1.1         update the ExCo/ARC with respect to certain aspects of Project Sparrow; and

         1.2         request approval to adopt an approach to prosecutions different to that which has
                     previously been adopted.

         Background

         2.1         In the last (October) CEO report to the Board, an update was given on Project Sparrow
                     in which it was noted that ".... a paper [will be submitted] to the November ARC
                     reviewing our overall policy for investigating and prosecuting future cases." For
                     convenience, a copy of the relevant section of that report is set out in Appendix 1.

         2.2         Since that update, Brian Altman QC has prepared two separate reports, one
                     commenting on "[POL's] strategy and process for reviewing past and current criminal
                     prosecutions in light of Second Sight's Interim Report" (the "backward looking report")
                     and the other making recommendations as to the future approach to the conduct of
                     prosecutions (the "forward looking report"). This second report did not seek to
                     comment on whether continuing with prosecutions was itself a sensible course of
                     action, either from a business or reputational perspective, simply whether it was an
                     effective use of resources from a criminal law perspective, and if so, whether there was
                     scope for improvement.

         2.3         The headline conclusion of the backward looking report is that the "...review [of the
                     cases that had been prosecuted over the last few years] is fundamentally sound" and
                     that no "systemic or fundamental flaws in the review process" were detected. In
                     addition, a number of relatively small procedural recommendations were made
                     regarding matters such as document retention etc.

         2.4         The forward looking report is similarly positive in tone, with Brian Altman commenting
                     that he had          seen no evidence to suggest that Post Office Ltd exercises its
                     investigations and prosecution function in anything other than a well-organised,
                     structured and efficient manner, through an expert and dedicated team of in-house
                     investigators and lawyers, supported by Cartwright King solicitors and their in-house
                     counsel..." That said, it was noted that "Post Office Ltd's prosecution role is perhaps
                     anachronistic...", and that "POL is the only commercial organisation (albeit Government
                     owned) I can think of (apart from RMG who retains a residual prosecuting function) that
                     has a prosecution role, and it is, to that extent, exceptional if not unique."

         2.5         An important fact to emerge from the 2 reports is that Post Office does not have any
                     special statutory power to bring prosecutions, rather it brings prosecutions in a purely
                     "private" capacity further to section 6(1) of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985, which

                     gives all individuals and companies the right to bring a private prosecution, should they
                     see fit. To that extent, therefore, the decision to undertake prosecutions is
                     discretionary: no legislation or regulation requires Post Office to undertake
                     prosecutions, nor is there any legislative policy that mandates that prosecutions should
                     be brought. That is not to say that the standards of evidence are in any way reduced, or
                     that the process is less rigorous than would be the case with a public prosecution, it
                     simply that the Post Office steps in to assume a function that typically would be
                     undertaken by the CPS, after the referral to it of a case by the police.

         2.6         The reasons why Post Office developed a private prosecutorial capability are historical;
                     reasons given for its retention include:

                     •       It serves as a "deterrent" i.e. it provides a clear signal to the whole network that
                             offences of dishonesty will be taken seriously;
                     •       It assists Post Office with its relationship with insurers; and
                     •       It re-assures employees that "securing the company's assets will be taken
                             seriously".

                     No empirical evidence has been given in support of the above, though from first
                     principles it would seem doubtful that the cost of, or the terms on which, insurance can
                     be obtained would be materially impacted by the existence, or non-existence, of a
                     prosecutorial capability.

         2.7         In addition, it has been said that it is quicker and more efficient to recover debts due to
                     Post Office using the criminal process (in particular the Proceeds of Crime Act). This is
                     clearly true, though the criminal recovery process, albeit very efficient, is a fairly blunt
                     and sometimes brutal process that involves the forcible sale of assets against the
                     backdrop of a criminal conviction and possible prison sentence. In the case of sub-
                     postmasters that are in financial distress, this may well involve the sale of their main
                     residence.

         2.8         A similar outcome could be achieved using the civil recovery process, though making
                     claims through the civil courts is a more cumbersome process, and the ability to obtain
                     orders "freezing" assets ahead of trials is much more restricted than it is in criminal
                     cases (in criminal cases, a "prosecuting authority" has the right to request a judge to
                     make an order freezing the defendant's assets once the investigation has commenced,
                     but before that it has gone to court).

         Activities/Current Situation

         3.1         Typically, some 250 investigations are conducted each year into cases of suspected
                     fraud or unexplained loss. In turn, this leads to around 50 prosecutions being brought
                     against sub-postmasters, all of which result in a conviction. The most common charge is
                     "false accounting", itself a very serious offence carrying a maximum tariff (7 years) not
                     dissimilar to theft (10 years); this offence of false accounting is technically committed
                     every time the end-of-day return is made on the Horizon system declaring that the sub-
                     postmaster's books balance when the sub postmaster knows they do not. Indeed, more
                     often than not, criminal investigations are started when the books have not balanced.
                     The internal "Network Support/Audit and Training" team (a team of around 200, some
                     of whom are charged with responsibility for undertaking stock-takes in the network)
                     identifies the fact that there is an unexplained cash or stock shortfall, and that the

                     books don't balance. In turn that team then notifies the security team which mounts an
                     investigation and decides whether or not prosecute.

         3.2         Prosecutions, however, are only brought to the extent that they fit within the internal
                     prosecution policy. This policy focuses on 2 factors: sufficiency of evidence and
                     likelihood of conviction — latterly a third factor has been added, which is the quantum
                     of the loss (amounts below £5k are now not pursued). The highest "risk" group of
                     offenders appears to be those sub-postmasters who have been in post for less than 5
                     years but more than 18 months. Amounts involved are generally less than £20,000,
                     though there are a handful of high value cases involving outright theft of cash or very
                     large stock deficiencies.

         3.3         Immediately following the Second Sight report, work was done to rationalise and
                     consolidate the pre-existing prosecution policy. That said, the consolidated policy is in
                     substance no different to that which has been applied previously; in any event, it has in
                     essence been held in abeyance and no further prosecutions have been initiated.

4.       Options Considered

         4.1         At a practical level, there are a number of alternatives to mounting our own criminal
                     investigations and undertaking private prosecutions. In particular, most companies
                     when faced with theft from employees, or agents, would simply contact the police, and
                     if fraud were a persistent problem, develop processes for engaging with them.

         4.2         Alternatively, it is open to companies (effectively) to bypass the police and go directly
                     to the local prosecuting authority (e.g. the CPS in England and the Procurator Fiscal in
                     Scotland); indeed for technical reasons, this is the approach that is adopted by Post
                     Office in Northern Ireland and Scotland. The experience in those 2 jurisdictions,
                     however, is that there is reluctance to prosecute all but the most serious, or the most
                     clear-cut, cases, as it is seen as a debt recovery (i.e. civil) matter. We have been
                     advised by Brian Altman that should Post Office go down the route of referring matters
                     to the police or the CPS, there would be a limited appetite to prosecute, even if all the
                     preparatory work (witness statements, fact finding etc.) had been done by Post Office
                     in house.

         4.3         In light of the above, four broad options were considered:

                     a)      Preserving the status quo — i.e. retaining prosecutorial capability and
                             continuing with a prosecutions policy that is not dissimilar to that which has
                             been used in the past;
                     b)      Pursuing a prosecutions policy focussed only on high value cases/cases
                             involving vulnerable members of society, and engaging with the police in
                             relation to other matters;
                     c)      Ceasing all prosecutorial activities but instead actively involving the police/CPS
                             etc where it is felt that they are likely to take matters forward; and
                     d)      Ceasing all prosecutorial activities as per option c) BUT coupled with work (as
                             yet not formally defined but some of which has already started as part of
                             project Sparrow and NT):
                            •        to gather better MI from the network;
                            •        to improve the overall control framework around the branch network;
                                     and
                            •        to provide more support to sub-postmasters.

                            This option is perhaps closest to that adopted by banks and others organisations
                            facing serious losses through fraud and criminal activity.

         4.4         As part of the evaluation process, however, consideration was given to broader policy
                     factors, including:

                     •   Post Office's brand image;
                     •   Whether undertaking prosecutions is consistent with a commercial franchisor-
                         franchisee relationship; and
                     •   The overall drive to develop better stake-holder engagement and a more mature
                         working relationship with sub-postmasters.

                     In light of these considerations:

                     •   Option a) above was felt to be, at best, sub-optimal and was not explored to any
                         great extent, other than to ask the question of Brian Altman whether it was
                         "efficient" in terms of the criminal process (which it is);
                     •    Option b) carried with it the risk that any residual prosecutions undertaken by Post
                         Office would be conducted so infrequently (probably only a handful each year) as
                         to mean that it was not efficient to maintain an internal team to handle them.
                         Accordingly, it too was discounted; and
                     •    Option c) was rejected as carrying an unacceptable risk of fraud and loss given the
                         scale of the "losses" currently suffered through theft and false accounting.

5.       Proposal

         5.1         It is proposed that Option d) be adopted and that, at an appropriate point in time, Post
                     Office no longer exercise prosecutorial rights against sub- post masters. It is further
                     proposed that:

                     a) Work now commence to ascertain the scope, and estimate the cost, of any
                        additional work that would need to be undertaken to gather better MI from the
                        network, improve the overall control framework, and provide better support to
                        sub-postmasters whilst protecting public funds. Part of this work could also be
                        focussed on exploring additional (non -criminal) sanctions that could be used against
                        sub-postmasters who have committed fraud; and

                     b) An analysis be undertaken of the ways in which civil proceedings can be used more
                        effectively to reduce the financial impact once Post Office becomes unable to
                        continue to use the Proceeds of Crime Act to recover money that has been mis-
                        appropriated.

         5.2         This last piece is important. Under the terms of the sub-postmasters contract, sub-
                     postmasters are liable to Post Office for all "losses" of stock/cash etc. Accordingly, a
                     "fraud" involving the loss of stock or cash gives rise to receivable in the hands of Post
                     Office, which if not recovered leads to a bad debt. Anecdotal evidence suggests that up
                     to 75% of all bad debts are recovered via the criminal debt recovery process, and that
                     around £1.5m is recovered annually. It is likely that a civil recovery process would lead
                     to a slower, and slightly lower, recovery rate, possibly of the order of £1 to £1.2m.

6.       Commercial Impact/Costs

         6.1         See 5.2 above. There may well be an offsetting impact on the headcount in certain
                     areas, in particular the security team and the legal team, though this has yet to be
                     quantified. However, there will be additional costs associated with enhancing the MI
                     and control framework, but these too have yet to be quantified and may to some
                     extent fall within BAU budgets (for example to the extent that they form part of the
                     audit function, they may be part of that budget).

7.       Key Risks/Mitigation

         7.1         These pertain mainly to the potential increased risk of fraud, and being seen to be
                     "soft" with public money, but should be capable of being addressed by enhanced Ml
                     and improvements to the control framework etc.

8.       Long term considerations — horizon scan

         8.1         Not taking action now in relation to the prosecutions policy could lead to, or
                     exacerbate, the impact of further adverse publicity regarding Post Office's treatment of
                     sub-postmasters.

         8.2         Taking this action may assist in developing better stakeholder engagement.

9.       Communications Impact

         9.1         The communications team are already heavily involved in Project Sparrow, and it is
                     proposed to manage the communications of the above through that channel. A key
                     issue will be to ensure that any change of policy is properly positioned with MPs, the
                     JFSA and the wider Network.

10.      Recommendations

         The ExCo/ARC is asked to:

         10.1        note the update set out above; and

         10.2        approve proposals set out in paragraph 5.1 above.

8. Project Sparrow
 •     The Mediation Scheme has received 64 applications from sub -postmasters since it was opened at
       the end of August, with more expected before the deadline of 18 November. The Working Group
       overseeing the running of the scheme is now reviewing these applications to decide which should
       be accepted onto the scheme, which should be excluded and which require further information
       before a decision can be made. The aim is to get a few cases started on the mediation process
       before the end of 2013 with the majority happening between January and March next year. Sir
       Anthony Hooper has now been appointed as the Chair of the Working Group, and will lead his
       first meeting on 25 October.

 •     We are in the process of developing our internal settlement policy for the scheme, the purpose of
       which is to ensure that a consistent approach is taken to each case based on a clear
       understanding of the potential range of costs and outcomes from the process. A first draft will be
       discussed by the ExCo in November, although it will be subject to further refinement in light of
       the additional information that emerges about the caseload and our initial experiences of the full
       mediation process.

 •     Our external firm of criminal solicitors, Cartwright King (CK), has now completed a review of 301
       cases subject to past prosecution to identify whether we have a duty to disclose the findings of
       the Second Sight report and associated issues. CK has concluded that disclosure is appropriate in
       10 of these cases, and a short letter has therefore been sent to each of the defence teams to
       bring their attention to the report. It is now a matter for the defence in each case to determine
       what action, if any, they might take in light of this additional information. We are also awaiting
       an unknown number of further historical prosecution files from Royal Mail, although at this stage
       we have no reason to believe these will substantially increase the number of actual disclosures. In
       view of the potential interest from the Criminal Cases Review Commission, we have also asked
       our criminal barrister, Brian Altman QC, to conduct an independent review of the overall process
       we have taken to review past cases, reaching the conclusion that our approach is "fundamentally
       sound".

 •     We will submit a paper to the November ARC reviewing our overall policy for investigating and
       prosecuting future cases. This will be informed by a separate report that Brain Altman is
       preparing on the effectiveness of our current prosecutions approach from a criminal law
       perspective, but will also take into account wider business considerations such as value for
       money and reputational impacts.

 •     The first stage of the workstream looking at improvements to our sub-postmaster training and
       support processes will be completed in November, identifying the key gaps and shortcomings in
       our current approach, a detailed plan for delivering `quick wins' and an overarching plan for
       taking forward the more fundamental reforms to our organisational structure and culture over
       the next 6-12 months. The process will be informed by the new Branch User Forum, the
       inaugural meeting of which will be convened in November once the recruitment process for sub-
       postmasters has been completed.

•   As part of our talent strategy we aspire to develop a greater proportion of our senior
    managers internally (currently 66% of hires at grade 3A and above are external)

    This is why we have introduced a greater emphasis on talent identification as part of the
    performance management process




    These ratings were then mapped onto a 9 Box performance / potential matrix which
    Directorate teams calibrated

    From this we have now identified our °..l.bp Ialent (individuals with PDR of   4   or 5 and

                     POST OFFICE LTD EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE / BOARD

                    Approach to Performance Management — Noting Paper


1.     Purpose

The purpose of this paper is to update the Executive Committee / Board on:

       1.1       Analysis of employee turnover across management grades
       1.2       The actions in place to drive a culture of high performance

The paper was discussed at the NomCom on 6 November 2013.


2.     Introduction

       2.1       In order for the Post Office to achieve its strategic objectives and journey
                 towards a culture fit for mutualisation, it needs to create a high performance
                 culture.

       2.2       To achieve this, we must have a robust performance management approach
                 which aligns employee performance and behaviours with organisation goals and
                 objectives, differentiates and rewards great performance whilst ensuring that
                 under performance is effectively addressed.

3.     Employee Turnover Statistics — the current situation

       3.1       All data covers 12 months from September 2012 — September 2013.

       3.2       Overall turnover and employer driven turnover is highest in the SLP population
                 (16% and 12% respectively) following the assessment exercise for that group
                 over the last year.

       3.3       Below SLP, lower rates of turnover are evident for managerial and non-
                 managerial employee groups (see table 1 below). By comparison, the median
                 rate of employee turnover in the public sector was measured at 9.4% and across
                 the UK overall (all sectors) at 11.9% according to the CIPD Resourcing and
                 Talent Planning Annual Survey Report 2013.

                                  year end 2012/13, only 2% have left the business (as of 30 September 2013).

                         3.6      Of the manager grade employees who received the lowest PDR ratings at year
                                  end 2012/13, 57% of those rated with a PDR '1' and 14% of those with
                                  consecutive PDR `2 at mid-year and year end, have left the business (as of 30

                                  be done to ensure that we are adequately addressing under performance.




                        4.1       Advisor Plus (My HR Help) line manager support calls: With sponsorship
                                  from SLT members and support from HR Business partners, line managers of
                                  individuals who received a PDR rating '1' or a consecutive PDR rating of '2' wi ll

                                  calling campaign following the current Mid-Year performance review process.
                                  These calls will offer guidance and support, ensuring managers understand and
                                  can apply the options available to them to support their underperformers.
                                  Actions will be monitored and progress tracked, providing clear visibility to SLT
                                  members.

                         4.2      Improving Performance Procedure (IPP) for managers process: Following
                                  the NomCom meeting there was an additional action to review this process.
                                  Manager feedback has indicated the time required for an individual to complete
                                  the formal stages of the procedure is excessively long. The current process
                                  requires 18 weeks of formal performance monitoring (which follows at least 4
                                  weeks of informal monitoring). Guided by this feedback, along with comparison
                                  benchmarking with other organisations, a proposed shorter timescale will be
                                  outlined for the formal monitoring stages. Individuals will receive focused
                                  development plans and support, encouraging them to demonstrate an
                                  improvement in performance in a shorter, but still reasonable timeframe. The
                                  existing process was agreed with the CMA, therefore any change will require
                                  union consultation. A plan for implementation is outlined in Appendix 2.

                                  workshop wil l target selected first line managers, with the objective of building

               situations with their team members, helping address any issues immediately.
               There is a planned series of workshops that will be rolled out by 31 March 2014.


       4.4     Introduction of Discovery Day 2 for new line managers: All managers who
               are new to the Post Office, or new to the role of managing others, attend a two
               day workshop created to ensure that all their line management responsibilities
               and the associated processes are understood.

       4.5     FY 2013/14 Mid-Year focus on personal and career development: To support
               our belief that everyone in the Post Office has the potential to grow and to
               continue building a high-performing and engaged work-force, we introduced a
               greater focus on personal and career development, with targeted development
               plans in our performance management process.

       4.6     Talent development: We are able to identify managers who show potential
               through the Mid-year review process and nurture them through our talent
               initiatives. The aim is to ensure we have bench strength at all layers in the
               organisation and that we pay attention to stretching and developing talent to
               raise organisational capability.

       4.7     Crown Leadership Programme: a key part of the plan to bring the Crown
               network back to profit is investing in our managers to enable them to lead,
               inspire and transform their branches. This represents a huge investment in
               developing capability to ensure managers have the support, development and
               confidence to lead their branch as part of the back-to-profit vision. Launched
               this year, part of the programme includes managers creating their personal
               development plan, with modules focused on key aspects of leading and
               managing teams, including performance management.

5.     Conclusion

       5.1     The focus of performance management in the Post Office is to build a capable
               workforce to support delivery of business goals. This will help ensure a healthy
               turnover that supports creation of opportunities for new and existing talent in the
               business

       5.2     Our employee turnover position is slightly lower than other organisations. We
               will continue to provide direct support to those managers who are managing
               underperformers.

       5.3     Sponsorship from SLT is required for the line manager support calls campaign
               following the current half-year performance review process.


6.     Recommendations

       6.1     The Executive Committee / Board are asked to note the update and actions set
               out above.

                        People implications of cost reduction projects

1. Purpose

The purpose of this paper is to:

    1.1. Outline the proposed approach to managing the people implications of the cost
         reduction activity. This will apply to affected areas outside of the Crown Network.

    1.2. Seek agreement from the Executive Committee to implement the proposals,
         including the use of compulsory redundancy.



2. Background

   2.1 In response to the cost challenge, the cost management steering group has
       identified potential staff cost savings FY 14/15 of £9.9m, amounting to a headcount
       reduction of c.210 FTEs across the business. A detailed summary is shown in
       appendix 1.

   2.2 The following mechanisms for managing staff costs have already been put in place
       to support effective cost management:

         • No external recruitment without the approval of the HRBP and functional director

         • No additions to template without the approval of the CFO and CHRO, with the
           underlying principle of one in, one out

         • Panel review and approval of requests for new and extensions to contractors

         • Contractor Christmas Furlough

    2.3 Historically, the approach the business has taken to redundancy situations is to
        achieve it on a voluntary basis, often through a blanket preference exercise. To
        date this has been manageable; however as an independent business moving
        towards a smaller organisation, it is critical that we retain people with the capability
        and potential to drive the organisation forward and to achieve this will require the
        use of compulsory redundancy.

   2.4 The collective agreement relevant in these situations is the 'Managing the Surplus
       Framework' (MTSF). Whilst MTSF does not discuss compulsory redundancy
       explicitly, it does not exclude it as an option.

   2.5 Post Office has made compulsory redundancies within the management population,
       albeit on a limited basis.

   2.6 To ensure that any dismissals by way of compulsory redundancy are 'fair', we will
       need to demonstrate that we have consulted with the relevant union, applied
       transparent selection criteria, put in place reasonable steps to consider 'suitable
       alternative employment' for individuals at risk who wish to remain with the business,
       prior to making them redundant. The latter step can be built into the notice period
       so not adding further time onto the process.

             3. Alternatives Considered

                   3.1. Continue to effect headcount reduction through seeking volunteers only. By
                        continuing to reduce headcount on this basis the business would risk losing the
                        talent it will need going forward. (Not recommended)



                         (,Recommended)

                   3.3. Go straight to compulsory redundancy without seeking volunteers. This could
                        have a negative impact on the culture and integrity of the organisation and does not
                        support the principle of ensuring people leave the business with dignity and respect.
                        (Not recommended).

                   3.4. Avoid redundancy situations altogether by redeploying to any vacancy. This
                        could mean the business risks mismatching people to roles, meaning we do not have
                        the right people in the right roles at the right time. In addition, moving to a smaller
                        organisation in the future may mean sufficient vacancies are not available. (Not
                        recommended).




                   4.1. The purpose of the Organisation Design principles wil l be to ensure good
                        governance of any structural changes within the organisation, maintaining oversight
                        and ensure alignment of any changes. Any change that affects roles and people will
                        need to be handled appropriately, with well thought through design and
                        implementation plans to ensure that long term impacts have been properly
                        considered and ensure benefits will be realised.

                   4.2. It is important that organisation design focuses on roles not individuals. The role of
                        OD governance is to ensure

                          • A holistic view of the Organisation Design Pan-POL

                          • Structure follows strategy

                          • Long term requirements are not compromised with short term gains

                          • Grade creep/costs are properly managed

                          • Implementation (costs and process) has also been duly considered and is fit for
                            purpose

                   4.3. Further work is on-going regarding the detai l of the above and both the principles
                        and process wi ll be presented to ExCo for agreement by the end of November_

                   4.4. While the organisation design principles will guide structural change and roles, the
                        resultant people implications will then need to be considered and managed.

5. Managing the people implications

    5.1. Each functional area, working with their HRBP will be accountable for describing and
         documenting their revised organisation structure, together with supporting rationale
         prior to consultation.

    5.2. Appointments to the impacted area will be on the basis of capability. Selection
         criteria will need to be developed. Whilst talent retention is a key consideration it
         cannot itself be a selection criterion. Where roles remain unchanged the principle of
         flow through will apply'.

    5.3. We will continue to work within the parameters of MTSF, ensuring the business has
         a robust process in place to aid the realisation of efficiencies in a timely manner
         whilst retaining capability and talent.

    5.4. Line managers, supported by HR, will be accountable for communicating all
         decisions to the people impacted by the change.

    5.5. Individuals who remain at risk following the selection process will have the option of
         electing to leave the business on voluntary redundancy. If at the end of the
         consultation period, individuals remain unplaced, they will be made compulsory
         redundant. This will apply to managerial and non-managerial grades.               It is
         anticipated that the cost reduction targets will not be met without the use of
         compulsory redundancy.

    5.6. To underpin this approach HR will ensure:

         • There are clear and consistent selection for retention criteria, though detail will
           vary according to function/role (these are predetermined under MTSF for non-
           management roles)

         • A robust redeployment process is in place (see section 5)

         • We comply with collective consultation requirements in accordance with
           legislation and our union agreements

         • We have a clear and simple process for line managers to follow, ensuring we
           comply with individual consultation and notification requirements

         • There is clear and straightforward supporting documentation and guidelines for
           use by line managers

         • Appropriate support is in place for managers leading on the people implications of
           change




1 Flow through will only apply where the number of identical roles remains unchanged. Where there is
a reduction in the number of similar roles a selection criteria will be applied.

    5.7. The table below outlines the expected timings of potential redundancies as stated by
         each directorate through the cost management steering group.


                  Month        Total
                  Oct-13         1
                  Dec-13         1
                  Mar-14        31
                  Apr-14        48
                  Aug-14         6
                  Mar-14        81
                   TBC          42
                  Total         210


         These numbers will need to be fully scoped and validated by HR and Finance;
         however, where possible for the benefit of consultation with the Unions, any
         discussions around redundancies should be phased. This will provide a coordinated
         response to the Unions and will avoid the potential perception that the business is
         undergoing a continuous programme of redundancies rather than a number of small
         tranches.

    5.8. Appendix 2 outlines an indicative timeline which will need to be followed in order to
         ensure these principles are met and that our people are managed in line with our
         values.



6. Redeployment & transition support

    6.1. As part of the consultation process we will need to demonstrate that consideration
         has been given to suitable alternative employment opportunities, prior to making
         compulsory redundancies.

    6.2. The points below outline the high level approach in order to create a framework to
         support our people whose jobs may be affected by business change to find suitable
         alternative employment or leave the business.

         • Provide tools to assist our people in managing their career within the business by
           being job ready to apply for suitable alternative roles to create internal mobility
           and retain identified talent

         • Reduce the overall cost to the business of managing a surplus population by
           invoking CR whilst exploring any other options. 'At risk' individuals will be given
           access to roles. Suitable alternatives will be assessed on capability. Where a
           candidate demonstrates the requisite capability they will be appointed

         • Support exiting employees by providing a cost effective outplacement support
           service for those who volunteer to go

                  6.3. Going forward, further suggested supporting mechanisms should include;

                         • No recruitment or permanent appointments to SLP without approval of CHRO
                           and CEO

                         • Active performance management — supporting managers to address weaker
                           performers (active campaign of support for consistent poor PDR performance)

                         • No internal recruitmentlpromotions without the approval of HRBP and functional
                           director

                  7.1    In summary, following the decision to implement business change:

                         • Structural re-design and role changes agreed with the OD team

                         • Appropriate phased consultation with Unions ensuring a coordinated approach

                         • Selection criteria in place based on retention of capability

                         • A simple process in place to manage offers of suitable alternative employment
                           and voluntary redundancy

                         • Compulsory redundancy on statutory terms will be invoked at the end of the
                           consultation period for unresolved individuals



             8. Risks/Mitigation

                         • Adverse effect on Industrial relations — Trade Unions may push back against
                           the use of CR as it will be seen as the first time we have utilised it as an option.
                           This will be mitigated by early engagement with the unions and a robust
                           redeployment process, ensuring all other options are explored and exiting
                           employees are treated with dignity and respect.

                         • Lack of a co-ordinated approach to redundancy and redeployment across
                           Post Office Ltd — This will be mitigated by a communications plan supporting
                           the proposed approach, with phased consultation with the Unions.

                         • Post Office does not meet legislative requirements, leading to negative
                           reputational impact and tribunal — Mitigated by the proactive interventions of
                           the HR Business Partners, ensuring the business meets legislative regulations.

                  Where structural and roles changes mean that new roles exist, interviews would need to be
