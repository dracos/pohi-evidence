1 Introduction

This document describes the way in which the various internal and external Defect Management reports
are produced for LIVE Defects including branch impacting. It can be used as a procedural document that
can be referred to and updated in line with changes and/or improvements that are made to the Defect
Management reports as they evolve and change owing customer or internal requirements.

1.1 Overview of the Live Defect Management Reporting
approach

1.2 The Goal

e If the Live Incident or Live Defect affects, or could affect, branch operations, we share it with
POL in a weekly HDR Report and at the Horizon Defect Review (HDR) weekly meeting

1.3 Background

« The Defect Management reports are produced for internal and external distribution in order to
demonstrate Fujitsu’s management and communication of the LIVE affecting defects including
those that have a branch impact.

e The LIVE affecting defects reported to POL will have one or more of the following collections
added in order to qualify as a candidate for reporting:

o ##LiveAffectingDefect
o HDR-FIN — Horizon Defect Review — Financial Impact
o HDR-EXP - Horizon Defect Review - SPM Experience
e These Defects could be in various stages whilst reporting on them to POL:

o INVESTIGATING - A Live Defect will start out as a Potential Live Defect until sufficient
investigation has taken place

= [Fujitsu internal unless linked to a bonded Incident]

o SOLUTIONING - If a fault is confirmed then this will progress to be a Confirmed Live
Defect (if it is not a fault then the Potential Live Defect will be closed)

« [Fujitsu internal as a solution still needs to be identified and agreed]

o PROPOSED FOR - Once a solution is identified for a Confirmed Live Defect it will need
to go through the POA processes before the fix is assigned to a sensible Release

= [Fujitsu internal involving developer / feature conflict check. Counter defects are
discussed with POL]

o TARGETED AT - Releases are then managed through to deployment to Live
= [Visible to all parties as the Release work starts]

2.1 Weekly HDR Report Creation Work Instructions

To create the weekly HDR Report which is shared with POL, follow these steps:

o The criteria to be used to determine HDR reporting candidates to share with POL will be
determined by creating a list using the following logic. The resulting list allows for the HDR
candidates to be identified.

o Prepare the report to send to POL

e A spreadsheet format has been used to date so the previous week’s POL “HDR Defects
update report — dd.mm.ccyy v1.0.xlsx” submission should be used as the basis for the
new report — removing all previous week highlighting and deleting rows scored out as
POL have been told these are being removed.

= Save the file as v0.1 initially and use v1.0 for the version that is shared with
POL. As a visual reminder add WIP into cell B2

= It may be easier to create several draft versions i.e. v0.1, v0.2, v0.3 etc during
the creation of the report, so that it is in a state suitable to create v1.0 to share
with POL.

= Amend the date in F3 making sure to leave it as a text field or the title of the
section below it will not render correctly

o Create the Peak extract to build the report from

e Then, open any version of the “Peak_Defect_Management extract dd.mm.ccyy
hh.mm.xisx” spreadsheet and Enable Content and go to the Data tab
“##LiveAffectingDefect" and click Refresh All. The password to run the embedded
queries needs entering 3 times and is! Save the resulting file with the
timestamp to match when the extract was created — so it can be referred back to. Turn
off AutoSave

© Quick filtering method:

* Go to the “HDR Report Pivot” tab

e Right mouse click on any part of the filter values at the top and choose “Refresh”

Double click on the number to open a new sheet with the relevant Peak(s) listed

and rename it “HDR Report”

It is more likely that the result set largely matches the previous results showing
in the HDR Report. Alternatively, you can create v0.1 using the previous report.
Compare the previous HDR report to the new list and amend accordingly so the

new HDR report list matches what the system now shows

o To do this it is worth hiding the following columns as it makes to easier
to compare the data against the previous HDR Report:

«= B-Summary

= D- Product
= _E-—Product Group
= G-—Priority

e Any that are new should be added to the list and highlighted in red on the HDR Report
tab whilst they are checked and completed

o These then need scrutiny to ensure they look correctly tagged as HDR.
This will require the Peak to be read and checked

co If they are HDR, then the Impact tab needs checking to ensure it is
complete and reads well. Any amendments should be referred to the
SMEs for updates to be added to Peak

o When the report is ready to submit, the highlighting on the new rows
should be changed to yellow

FYI ONLY — MANUAL FILTERING
o If the HDR Report Pivot is absent or corrupted, then the manual filtering is as follows
o Go to the ##LiveAffectingDefect tab and filter as follows:
e Set the filter on Response Category [column J] to exclude the No Fault Found values
(see Appendix A)
e Seta filter on HDR Classification [column BF] to exclude blanks
¢ Seta filter on Planned Out Live [column AH] so the dates are in the future or blank (it
has not been deployed)
e Exclude closed Peaks where Status [column I] is “C” —- as these may have been fixed
outside of a release by Ingenico themselves
o Then the 1 List needs to be created that can be used to compare against the previous week's
report:
o Deferred Live Defect Peaks
e Set the filter on Deferred [column BH] to “Yes”
e These are unlikely to be discussed at HDR as they are previously approved and
understood but are provided to show the level of Fujitsu control
o Project Live Defects
e Set the filter on PBS Project [column BG] to “Yes”
e These are unlikely to be discussed at HDR as they are part of the ongoing Project
Manager regular review calls
o Non-Project Live Defects (likely originating from an Incident during normal service delivery)
e Change the filter on PBS Project [column BG] to exclude “Yes”
e These require more comprehensive information as these will be discussed at the
HDR meeting
e Extract the list as described above
o These previously were listed as individually in their own sections but is now reported all together.

Appendix A — No Fault Found Response Category values

Peaks with the following Response Categories are deemed to be No Fault Found as no action was
required to remedy the issue raised. In some cases this is because the fault is within an area of the
system that is managed using TfSNow and hence Peak is not the source of the Live Defect information.

Response Category — 68 -- Final -- Administrative Response

2.3 Updating the PIVOT Tab of the Weekly Defect Update
Report

The Pivot tab of the Weekly Defect Update report provides a table and graph that illustrates 1)
The Proposed For 2) Targeted At 3) TBC for the Defects displayed in the HDR Report - Open
Defects by Target Release and HDR collection i.e. Impact and Experience.

If no new defects are added to the report, then the table and graph can be refreshed to pick up
any changes by following the below steps:

2.4 Providing updates to POL Questions in the meeting and

additional questions

As a result of the weekly HDR meeting there maybe questions raised by POL that you will need
to read the Defect PEAK or engage the required technical resource to gain the required updates
to add to the Impact Tab so a revised HDR Extract can be provided in the next HDR Report.

Additionally, POL may send questions on HDR Defect PEAKS in order to gain clarification, that
will again need to be added to the Impact Tab so a revised HDR Extract can be added to the

HDR Report.

These actions can be performed outside of the producing of the weekly HDR Update Report in
order to be ready to add the report against the appropriate HDR Defect PEAK in the report.

2.5 Sending POL the Weekly HDR Report

e Once all the required changes have been added to the HDR Report, you are know in a position
to create v1.0 to send to POL by approximately 10:00 on a Friday morning, in preparation for the
HDR meeting with POL on a Monday morning (Usually 11:45). If you send it a little late owing to
awaiting an update from a technical resource, that is not a big issue as long as it is sent to POL

by close of play on the Friday.

o Open the latest draft version of the report i.e. HDR Defects Update Report v0.2

o Ensure that all the required updates, HDR Extracts and Screenshots have been added to
the report. This includes checking against the actions from the minutes of the previous
meeting sent by POL in order to ensure that the required information to answer POL
questions is included in the HDR Extracts for the appropriate HDR Defect PEAKS. This
will assist in confirming the status of the Fujitsu actions from the previous meeting.

co If so, remove the word “WIP” into cell B2 and save the report as “HDR Defects update

report — dd.mm.ccyy v1.0.xIsx”

o Next prepare the email to be sent to POL that the report needs to be attached to. Please

see example of the weekly email for the HDR Update Report below:

e The four updates are:
co 1 has had the Target Release updated.
o 1 has Status Update amended to reflect POL questions
o  1has RCA updated etc amended to reflect POL questions
= Already provided revised HDR to POL on Monday 26" of
September.
oc 1has the latest problem update.
e The one closed defect from last week:
o PC0302653 - Invalid session receipts printed before session settlement
& user confused as to how to settle it
= The HDR extract has been updated to reflect POL accepting
that this is not a defect and is working as per design, as result of
meeting held on Wednesday 28" of September.

There are NO OPEN ACTIONS for Fujitsu — as I have engaged technical resources and
updated the HDR Extracts for the below:

* PC0302313 DEV - PIN Pad Record Not Updated To Show When
Responsive/Non-responsive during logon or unlock
« PC0302653 Invalid session receipts printed before session settlement &

user confused as to how to settle it - (closed)
co Meeting held on Wednesday 28" of September as highlighted above.

I approve the minutes from the HDR Meeting on Monday 26/09 from a Fujitsu
perspective.

o Then add the report version 1.0 “HDR Defects update report — dd.mm.ccyy v1.0.xIsx” to the
email and send to

2.6 Saving the reports, minutes and emails to Sharepoint

In order to have an audit record of the HDR Defect Update reports, emails sent to POL and emails and
minutes of the meetings sent by POL to Fujitsu, there is a sharepoint location whereby all of these
emails and documents are held. Following the sending of the weekly report to POL, or responding to
POL emails with questions or the receiving of meeting minutes from POL please save them to the below
sharepoint location:

2.7 LIVE Defect Management Monthly Report Creation

To create the monthly Live Defect Management for POA stack owners and leadership, follow these
steps:

o Create the Peak extract to build the report from
e Then, open any version of the “Peak_Defect_Management extract dd.mm.ccyy
hh.mm.xisx” spreadsheet and Enable Content and go to the Data tab and click Refresh
fab. The password to run the embedded queries needs entering 3 times and
ave the resulting file with the timestamp to match when the extract was
created — so it can be referred back to. Turn off AutoSave
o Prepare the report

e« Aspreadsheet format has been used to date so the previous month's
“POA_Live_Defect_Management Monthly Report dd.mm.ccyy hh.mm.xisx” should be
used as the basis for the new report. To show history, copy the white box on the top left
of the Summary tab and paste it to the right as an image (you may need to delete a
previous image)

«Save the file with the same date and time values as the Peak extract created earlier so
you know which extract the report relates to

o Go to the ##LiveAffectingDefect tab and filter as follows

Then the 5 tabs are derived as follows:

Check the range of values in the Call Type column. If there are any that are neither “Live Incident”
nor “Defect Identified” then these need to be looked at to decide whether to treat them as one of
these 2 categories. There shouldn't be any, but if there are, it is most likely to be Vulnerability which
can be treated as Defect Identified. If so, amend the filtering below where ** is shown.

o Still Investigating
¢ Clear ail filters
e Filter the Planned Out Live date so it is in the future or blank (it has not been deployed)
e Filter out the No Fault Found Response Category values (see Appendix F)
e Filter Call Type to “Live Incident” ONLY **
= Consider filter on Status to exclude “C’losed — but beware the closures may be
wrong
e Extract the columns shown on the tab from the filtered list and paste the values into the
report
e Expand/contract the Stack owner column by copying/pasting the formula so all rows are
attributed to a name
o DI-Solutioning
¢ Clear all filters
e Filter the Planned Out Live date so it is in the future or blank (it has not been deployed)
e Filter out the No Fault Found Response Category values (see Appendix F)
e Filter Call Type to “Defect Identified” ONLY **
e Filter “Target Release Type” to exclude “Targeted At” and “Proposed For”
= Consider filter on Status to exclude “Closed — but beware the closures may be
wrong
= Manually add back in any that are “Targeted At’ or “Proposed For’ and Target
Release is “Re-target” if there are any
e Extract the columns shown on the tab from the filtered list and paste the values into the
