Subject: RE: Post Office Mediation Scheme

Please thank the Minister for that letter but despite all the words and the standard Post Office rhetoric, the Minister
failed to address the two direct question I had put to her, namely:- Minister, were you aware of Post Office’s actions
today? Did you approve beforehand their decision to close the Scheme?

I look forward to receiving answers to those two outstanding questions.
