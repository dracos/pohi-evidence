2.6 PINICLs
The PINICLs which have required most attention this last week:

FUJ00079162
FUJ00079162
@ 28584 concerning processing of transactions greater than 10 million pounds

28621 concerning problem with TPS Outlets File

@ 27578 Live trial OTX records for tender items having wrong value for Reversal Indicator.
Now routed to Agent Team: (but I need to keep an eye open for it)

The low priority PINICLs on my stack:

@ 23265 concerning Help Desk Transactions and Product 851: I currently propose to retain the
CSR solution for CSR+

¢ 23474 which is a placeholder in the KPR covering known issues in the Pathway to TIP
interface: some of the issues will be addressed for CSR+; some won't

@ 24350 which requires a minor wording change to the Pathway to Warehouse EPID

3. CURRENT CRITICAL ISSUES

3.1 Old issue - The requirement behind CP 2105 (Change Reference Data Delivery Performance
Measures) is going to cost whole plan a lot of work)

3.2 Old issue — CSR+ will provide Version Number of Item Transaction Mode to POCL. There are
concerns whether this will require significant support effort on Pathway resolving exceptions?

3.3 Old issue - I still have worries, concerning the data consistency between POCL TIP reference data
and Pathway reference data. (POCL TIP processes files: Pathway processes records).

3.4 Old issue - Auditors have an archive server for logging files for up to 18 months or so (including
TPS files sent to TIP). In extreme contingency situations support units may need to access this data
but Audit signal a “hands off” approach. What’s use of having an archive if no-one is ever being
allowed to use it?
