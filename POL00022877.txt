Jane
Following our recent call:
1) Neuberger QC being instructed now. Electronic bundle on the way to his clerks as I type.

2) Questions of Neuberger QC are:
a. Recusal application yes/no ?
b. If yes, thoughts on process and procedure and insight on approach of Court needed.
c. Opinion on appeal of contractual issues and implication of terms (noting this last work stream is
behind the first two, which are currently more urgent).

3) Paper files will also be with OEC today.

4) Level of "comfort" in first refusal over Grabiner QC (in the 6 week period until his next trial) to be assessed
and further e mails from me in that regard will follow when I have feedback from the clerks at OEC.

5) Ihave spoken to Mark Howard's clerk (Luke) at Brick Court. He will revert with immediate availability (next two
months) and I will update you later today.
