Summary

‘New cases halved this month (10 to 5) and included one high-risk investigation. @
A review of the low value, in-branch discrepancy cases currently on hold is underway and has led to 2 133% Increase in the

number of cases closed (14 from 6).

Increased workloads, quality assurance checks and high priority Inquiry matters mean a continuation of the pausing.

of some of the low-risk cases.
+ Eight low value in-branch discrepancy cases on hold (was 20).
+ One high value stamps investigation not started due to lack of resource.

Of the 35 open investigations, eight are PIDA related and four have identified potential misuse of SmartiD’s.

Accounting/Audit, Fraud and Theft remain the three most common investigation types. This trend can be expected to
continue or increase as people struggle to make ends meet with the rising cost of living.

Eight cases are currently being investigated in conjunction with the police as the team take on more complex and high
value cases. Additionally, support will be provided to the police in four low value cases which have been reported by PM's,
with a further four cases being reviewed with the intention of being reported by CIU if an evidential threshold is met.

The average investigation time has fallen by 7% to 143 (was 153) due to the increased number of cases closed this month.
Liaison with other departments and / or the police for their investigations is the main reason for the protracted time

scales.

resource (Lower Rd, Rotherhythe). Evidence is being gathered in the other two (New Cross, Deane}.

‘The average length for investigations has fallen to 143 days (from 153). Whilst the more complex investigations are time intensive,
may be waiting for reports from other departments or are currently with the police, this overall number has reduced due to the
Increase in cases closed this month. Work continues to review and close these at the earliest opportunity. Currently High-risk
average Is 155 days, Medium is 135 and Low is 142 ~ all show a reduction from last month.

‘Aside from the five cases opened this month, a further nine reports were received into triage. Of these, six have been signposted
‘or closed with na further action, leaving three which are undergoing initial enquiries. Indications are that all these three cases will
be low-risk, low impact investigations if accepted.

This month has seen two reports relating to the possible exchanging of Energy Bills Support Scheme Vouchers for
ceath. Transactional data is being looked at to see if these claims are substantiated. If they are, recommendations will be made for
‘Area Manager visits to confirm understanding of the scheme.

Operational

Improvements

> Quality Assurance checks began this month with a two days per week commitment by each of the

Senior Investigation Managers.
> Feedback has been received and amendments are being reviewed for the first draft of the
investigation manual,

Cultural:
> Presentation around function and constraints of CIU and Speak Up teams given to BEIS.
> Presentation received by the whole team around Data Protection issues.
> Workshops on disclosure and interviewing strategies were undertaken by the whole team

Risk Identification:
> The continued lack of a reliable, comprehensive reporting system with functionality for direct

reporting, analysis and data sharing. Mitigation: Work ongoing with procurement to gain final

costing and issue Purchase Order to supplier by end of March to use this year's budget. Expectation

will be for system to go live July / August 2023 with the option for decentralised teams to purchase

additional licences thereafter.

Difficulties around extracting and maintaining data in the current stand-alone Speak Up reporting

platform leads to potential duplication of work which is also recorded elsewhere

for ease. Mitigation: A replacement stand-alone system which can easily feed into the new reporting,

system is being investigated.

> Lack of resource - the complexity, as well as the number of cases being received or in the pipeline, is
Increasing. This, in conjunction with the apprenticeship and quality assurance commitment is
Impacting on the number of investigations that can be undertaken. Mitigation: A re-prioritisation of
Investigation criteria has been agreed, with cases falling outside of this being placed on hold until
capacity is available. Four new staff to be recruited on fixed term (1 year) contracts to support
Inquiry-related investigations. Uncertain whether additional BAU-type resource requests have been
approved, however, itis likely to be some months before the positions are filled.
