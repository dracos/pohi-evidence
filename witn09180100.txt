Background

  3. 1 started working for POL on 2r,c, April 1979, after 6-week counter training course

      I commenced working on the counter at Wigan Post Office. I performed this

     duty for 12 months and then became a TV license evasion officer. This job

     entailed visiting private households that records showed did not hold a TV

     license, interviewing people with a view to prosecution if no licence could be

     produced. The job also involved attendance at court when people pleaded not

     guilty.
                                                                                WITNO9180100
                                                                              WITN09180100




4. In October 1986 1 transferred to the Bolton Counter Remittance Unit and

   remained there until February 1992. My duties involved checking inward

   remittances of cheques, vouchers and country notes sent in by post offices. I

   also prepared outward remittances of coins and bulk cash for post offices to

   use. I also performed duty as lead cashier for 9 months during sick absences

   and other occasions during annual leave. This involved management of the




5. In February 1992 as the audit team needed someone with experience of

   completing a cash centre balance, I was asked to apply for a vacancy on the

   Manchester Audit Team. I was subsequently appointed to the position by Mr

   Dave Bainbridge, Audit Manager.



6. I was given in house training, attending audits with an experienced auditor who

   showed you how to perform the role. Post offices maintained records of

   transactions and money held daily in a daily book and once a week completed

   a balance in a weekly book. The cash and stock held on the last balance was

   our starting point when calculating receipts and payments as to the time of the

   audit and then a calculation of the value of cash, stock and vouchers on hand

   would indicate if the office had balanced. Subsequently details for items

   despatched to head office prior to our attendance, such as National Savings

   receipts and payments, telephone accounts paid etc, were checked on a

   microfiche. Crown offices were computerised first with a system called ECCO+

   and subsequently all office had the Horizon Accounting System installed on a

   date which escapes me. All auditors had to attend and pass a training course
                                                                                   WITN09180100
                                                                                WITNO9180100




   to remain in the Audit Team. I continued to perform audits using this system

   and our own computerised spreadsheet known as P32 until I retired as the end

   of September 2016.



7. Up to 2008 to Audit Team were responsible for completing audits in accordance

   with the annual audit plan, audits when robberies and burglaries occurred,

   audits when post offices changed hands and occasionally when members of

   the Investigation Branch (later Fraud Team) required them.



8. As the number of auditors were less than 40 for the whole country, we had often

   to travel long distances, so the business decided to merge the role of auditor

   with that of Training Officer to perform both roles in team. This role became

   known as the Field Support Advisor role_ We had to learn each other's jobs so

   I had to attend a refresher counter training course and accompany experienced

   trainers on site at post offices as new postmasters were assisted after their own

   counter training courses. The training covered all aspects of running a branch.

   The former trainers also attended a course on completing an audit and then

   they accompanied experienced auditors like me whilst they learned how to

   complete an audit, use the computerised P32 spreadsheet, interview the

   postmaster and staff asking compliance questions and completing the audit

   report at home after the audit.

exact date. In early 2010 my line manager was changed to Peter Jackson who

was based in Yorkshire. Our teams were approximately 12 in number, 4 former

auditors and 8 former trainers. We would meet monthly for team meetings and

annually the entire 120-person team would meet for a larger often two day

meeting each person learned the others job and was not allowed to perform the

job without experienced assistance until the line manager deemed them

competent to do so. The two teams Merged well together and after a period of

time all were professional and competent at the varying roles.




report which indicated what discrepancy if any was found at audit along with

compliance tests completed. Any discrepancies over £1000 or an amount when

theft was admitted was reported over the phone to the Contract Manager who

decided on the next course of action which would include the temporary

suspension of the postmaster and the completion of a final account at the post

office.




and on these occasions a theft report would be handwritten to be signed by the

postmaster and counter signed by the auditor for onward transmission to the

Investigations Manager responsible for the office. During the audit he would

also have been notified by phone on any occasion were suspension was

quite difficult. Up to 2008 1 did 5 audits per week and [for a two-year spell 8

audits a week], often more with robberies and transfers. Once the teams had

been merged some weeks, I would be doing on site training so no audits would

be completed. The size of offices ranged from small one man office, medium

ones with 2/3 staff assisting the postmaster, larger main offices with several

staff and multiple stock units right in to our own directly managed branches

know as Crown Offices. I also assisted in numerous cash centre offices in

different parts of the country. These offices contained bulk cash, coins and

stock (foreign currency, stamps etc) for supply to the network. My best estimate

for the number of audits completed is in excess of 5000.

  20. Once the teams merged in 2008 the former trainers attended induction training

      courses and then went out with experienced auditors as assistants on the audit.

      After a number of audits, they were expected to lead audits under supervision

      of an experienced auditors until they were deemed okay to do this without

     supervision. Refreshed training at Team Meetings was provided on a regular

      basis.

   and cash reporting as well as highlighting reported errors and losses. A profiling

   model focussing on the size of the branch, length of service and history of

   losses over the last 4 years was also examined. If the office had the same

   postmaster and had been audited previously then the previous audit report was

   examined to identify any weaknesses last time. Details of remittances received

   and despatched were examined. If the audit was a 3 month after appointment

   audit, then reference would be made to the trainers' report and any weaknesses

   identified during the one-site support. Any special audits raised by the Fraud

   to check if any transfers of cash had not been accepted. If they identified any

Audit of              Branch


           Hightown
   45. 1 first became involved in the above audit as a Field Support Advisor with

      responsibility for performing audits at post offices I was contacted by our

      scheduling team and asked to perform an audit accompanied by my colleague

      Richard Cross.



   46. At this period the Horizon Online system was being upgraded and officers

      known as Migration Support Officers were being sent to offices assist

      postmasters with the process. Part of the process was to check the cash

      recorded in the office cash declaration. Tracy Bedford, the Migration Support

      Officer had found the cash to be £13624.41 short. She therefore closed the

      office and reported the matter. An audit was scheduled as a result.


  47. We attended the office at 13.00 and introduced ourselves to Miss Hall. She had

      been expecting our visit due to circumstances of the previous day. We counted

      the cash and stock and completed an audit on the computerised P32 in the

      normal manner, comparing the figures to the office snapshot balance and the

      previous evenings cash declaration.


  48. 1 counted the cash and Mr Cross counted the stock which includes postage

     stamps and other value items. I was responsible as head Auditor for completing

     the audit balance and for speaking to Miss Hall about any reasons she felt had

     caused the overall discrepancy on the day of £14023.37.

    Horizon System as a receipt,} going back 18 months. She said the current loss

    had built up overtime and that she had inflated the cash on hand when

   completing the office balances which all showed a clear balance.


50.An examination of previous Trading Statements printed all showed a clear

    balance and Miss Hall stated these were adjusted to show clear before rolling

   over into the next accounting period. Cash declarations together with snapshots

    produced indicate the cash declaration was falsely made for some considerable

   time. For clarification for some of the lottery scratch card activations in the report

   document the Camelot instants activated receipt was found on 3 occasions not

   to have the report attached which indicated that they had not been entered on

   the Horizon System.


51. A large number of discrepancies between other stock items in hand compared

   to figures on the Horizon Snapshot balance were found. This usually indicates

   poor completing of the Trading Statement balance. I rang Product and Branch

   Accounting at Chesterfield to see if any further discrepancies were due for the

   office and was told £819.00 due mainly to activations on the Lottery Terminal

   not all being remitted on the Horizon System. Miss Hall had been accepting the

   Transaction Corrections adjusting the instants on hand back down to the correct

   figure but not putting the money in which she would have received from sale of

   the scratch cards, in to compensate.


52. I had seen other offices get into difficulty with Lottery Accounting and additional

   training was provided when this was brought to the attention of the Contract

   Advisor. I was concerned that Miss Hall had let the situation continue for a long

   time without seeking help in the hope that things would rectify.

53.A full check of al l inward and outward remittances were checked against the

   remittance advices and verified these agreed with the snapshot balance. A full

   examination of all scratch card and lottery game receipts and payments (for

   prizes paid) was made.


54. Having considered my witness statement at [POL000187 1], Ms Hall's

   concerns about the Lottery Accounting were examined at the audit and the

   printouts for Lottery Scratch cards activated were examined against the report

   sent to her from Product and Branch Accounting Chesterfield. These revealed

   3 occasions where a pack had been activated but not entered onto the Horizon

   system. A phone call to the team at Chesterfield advised that other Transaction

   Corrections were in the pipeline for £819.00 mainly for Instants not remitted in.

   Subsequent to the audit enquiries were made in depth with Mr Neil

   Thorneycroft, the Lottery Scratch card Manager in the [POBA] Section in

   Chesterfield by Christopher G Knight, Fraud Investigator.


55. Ms Halls concerns were advised to Karen Arnold, Contract Advisor and Andrew

   Daley, Fraud Team during the audit.


56.At no point during any audit conducted by me or any I attended led by anyone

   else were errors attributed to the Horizon IT System.


57.Apart from notifying the Fraud Team Manager, Andrew Daley whilst on site at

   the audit I have no recollection of any other discussions with members of the

   Fraud Team. I was subsequently asked by a member of that team to complete

   a witness statement for use in court.
