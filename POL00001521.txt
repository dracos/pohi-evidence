art of Response]

Martin & I have investigated and find there is a typo in the 8130 script (double closing
p,23) which seems to be causing the problem:

racket in two WriteRecoveryData steps

I Validation>RECOVERY (ADCScript-PORecovery-8130) )</Validation>

We are going to try it without as an Addon but POL will need to change the master source.
