Do you have any thoughts, I have not looked at this yet but we should try and get it agreed (internally) by the end of the
week.

Thanks

Gavin - could you send me the TOR so that I can take a look at it.

Re reporting to POL I will check with Paula — maybe Chair of audit Committee but I will confirm no he is not needed for
Thurs.

I have copied Andy Holt our project manager I am sure he can help with the trip to do Horizon training

Susan

Are you free for a call later today/tomorrow morning so that I can push forward on the BAQC outstanding action points? I
would like to discuss:

1. Finalising BAQC's TORs

2. Who BAQC should report to at POL and when (I assume he is not required for the Audit Committee meeting on
Thursday)

3. Who I should contact to set up BAQC's Horizon training in Newport.
Hope you found yesterday's conference useful.
Kind regards
