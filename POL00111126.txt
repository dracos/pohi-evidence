Hi Catherine,

I spoke to Pete Newsome about this yesterday and he was still of the view that it's not for Fujitsu to provide the potted
history that we are looking for. Have you been abie to speak to Garry? Our expert advises that it's an important
requirement for his report.

Kind regards

Catherine
Would you (or someone else at Post Office?) be able to help unlock Point 2 below?

Generally, FJ are being quite helpful but they are being a little bit stubbom around providing a potted history of the
development of Horizon. What we're looking to do is to give the Judge the story of how Horizon has evolved over 20
years. We're not looking for chapter and verse on every change, but at the moment the only major milestone we are
aware of is the change from Horizon to Horizon Online.

I'd be happy for this info te come from POL but I suspect that FJ might have a better corporate memory for this task.
Can you think of any other way forward or would you mind speaking to Pete to see if you can get FJ to help?

Thanks
Andy

Thanks for the email. I have produced answers to your questions below.

POL-0108732
POLO0111126
POL00111126

Point 2 — history of releases — what we are reaily looking for is a written narrative of how Horizon has evolved. What are
the key milestones and events in that evolution? When were major changes made and why? Ideally, this will be cross
referenced to the key releases. The experts need this background contextual information to set the foundation for their
reports. What I have in mind is a 10-20 page written document setting out, as best as someone can remember, the story
of Horizon. We do not have a potted history on the development of Horizon from the point of view of what changes have
been made to the system. In terms of Why changes were made we would have knowledge on those driven by technical
need e.g. Belfast Refresh but any other change for business need would be best answered by Post Office. We can supply
you with more detail on what was in the changes in the document supplied (the CP documents have more detail along
with the CR raised by Post Office) but feel any history of the solution should be driven from Post Office with Fujitsu
supplying factual information around that change from a technical perspective.

Point 5 ~ Access logs — this is urgent. When will Fu be able to give us the logs? This week? We have taken an extract of
logs from the audit store and are now examining those records to ensure they have the data on super user logins. Once

this data is confirmed as suitable we will be able to give a timetable for delivery along with dates for which the data is
available and an estimate of the volume of data.

Jonny is on holiday this week so I don't think your regular call will be going ahead tomorrow.
Just picking up a couple of points in your comments below.

Further to our call this morning and yesterday's discussion with Gareth and Torstein I have summarised the current status
of our various work streams and set out some requested additional actions in the table below.

Having spoken to Andy I'm now aware that Post Office has been ordered to disclose the privileged user logs that we
discussed yesterday by the Court. One of the requested actions below is therefore for Fujitsu to provide the logs — please
would you let me know how long this will take? Once we have them we can discuss what witness evidence (if any) we
need to prepare in relation to Issue 12 (“If [Post Office] and/or Fujitsu did have [the] ability [the ability/facility to: (i) insert,
inject, edit or delete transaction data or data in branch accounts; (ii) implement fixes in Horizon that had the potential to
affect transaction data or data in branch accounts; or (iii) rebuild branch transaction data], how often was that used, if at

all?").
Feel free to give me a call to discuss.
Kind regards

Jonny

Work stream

Current status

Requested additional
actions

1 Experts’ request for specific
Peaks.

Requested by Dave on 29
August.
[Matthew Lenton] Done

N/A

2 Experts’ request for a
summary of the major
Horizon releases (new
functionality and
fundamental bugs).

Dave to speak to someone
about how the major
releases came about.

[Matthew Lenton] Policy
agreement with POL on
how mojer releases are
formed is in PA/STR/003.

Pete to speak to Matthew
next week to work out who
is best placed to provide
the requested summary.
[Matthew Lenton] The
Release Schedule
[attached] details Release
numbers against CPs and
descriptions of the purpose
of the release. Would this
be sufficient? Some of the
information has been
archived off the sheet, but
we think it can be
provided.

N/A

3 Horizon Issues witness
evidence (Issues 2, 10, 11
and 12 as discussed
yesterday)

Dave and Pete to obtain
written answers to the
questions in paragraphs
2.54, 2.7.1-2.7.4
(inclusive), 3.4 and 3.5 of
the 28 August areas to
cover document (attached)
and set up calls with the
relevant people to discuss
the written answers with
WBD during the week

Please provide details of
their availability between
now and 28 September (the
deadline for exchange of
witness evidence).

POL-0108732

commencing 10
September.

[Matthew Lenton] 2.5.4:
The wording of 2.4.2
confuses use of the term
“Balancing Transaction” as
it states both that “there
has only been one usage of
BTs” and “BTs are used
more routinely”. Please
therefore confirm which
type of correction are we
being asked to comment
onin 2.5.4? On the
assumption that it is the
“Branch Database
transaction correction”, I
have added the answer
that it is documented in
DEV/APP/LLD/0142 and
DES/APP/HLD/0020
(section 5.6.2).

2.7.1: Yes, numbers quoted
are correct.

2.7.2: We have records
going back to January
2014 only; these contain
the names of individuals
within the NT and Unix
teams. Would it be
necessary to include the
names?

2.7.3: Jason Muir: No they
cannot. Access is
controlled by a specific
MSAD group and the
DBA’s aren’t in that group.
{Need confirmation on this
statement).

Gerald Barnes: Refer to
DES/APP/HLD/0029 and
DES/APP/HLD/0030, Audit
HLDs.

When a session is started
at the counter a special
temporary private session
key and public key are
generated using the public
keys stored on the counter
and audit server. The
public key is stored in the
audit trail and all
messages written in the

POLO0111126
POL00111126

POL-0108732
session are signed with the
private key. At the end of
the session the private key
is destroyed. in addition
each message is assigned
a contiguous JSN.

When a
prosecution ARQ is done
the audit server can check
each signature is correct
using a combination of its
public key ond the
temporary public key
stored for each session.
Now it is completely
impossible to tamper with
a message because the
signature can only be
generated with the private
session key thot was
destroyed. in addition
messages cannot be
inserted or deleted
because the audit server
checks JSNs are contiguous
and without duplicates.

itis a similar
thing to public private key
encryption. Anyone can
encrypt a message with his
public key but the only one
who can read it is the one
with the private key which
was used to generate the
public key in the first case.
2.7.4: Jason Muir has
provided one week of
sample audit data
showing those Privileged
Users that have logged
into the database, this is
now with Gareth
Seemungal and Torstein
for analysis to see if it will
provide the required
information.

Gareth mentioned that
these go to the remote
