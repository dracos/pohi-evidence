in addition I have asked Simon to make sure we have the costs accrued in this financial year and a fair
proportion of the costs are for scanning of documents rather than Second Sight.

Thought you might like to see before your 121 with Alice. This is the document I used to brief
both you and Alice and we discussed at 121s, I think the 121s were in jan not dec.

As you will see at that stage the costs were a lot less but this was the first time we made it clear
that SS did not expect to finish by the summer recess.

Alice was disappointed by this but recognised the need to let SS do the review thoroughly

So the issue now is that the costs have risen significantly, this was always likely as JFSA
engaged with the process And pushed more cases through

What this weeks exchange with Alice has shown me is we need more regular updates, we had
agreed they would be quarterly, and I need to get closer to the costs.

Hope that helps.

Ihave a 121 with Alice as well today so will discuss with her as well

Thanks
Alwen
