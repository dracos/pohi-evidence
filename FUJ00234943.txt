Schedule 16
Payment and Banking Service: Service Description
1. BACKGROUND
inl Payment and Banking Service is a set of management services and infrastructure components

that have been deployed by Fujitsu Services in conjunction with its Sub-contractor Ingenico.
The Payment and Banking Service is developed to interact with the HNG-X System to provide
the following Business Capabilities and Support Facilities:

(a) the Banking Business Capability, as described in paragraph 2.5 of
Schedule B3.2 of the Agreement;

(b) the management of payments using the Debit Card and Credit Card
methods of payment within the Payment Management Business
Capability, as described in paragraphs 2.10.4 - 2.10.8 of Schedule B3.2 of
the Agreement; and

(c) the Transaction Management Support Facility, as described within
paragraph 3.4 of Schedule B3.2 of the Agreement.

Payment and Banking Service was implemented to reduce the scope of the Card Data
Environment (CDE) within the HNG-X System, it communicates all Cardholder Data point-
to-point encrypted within the Payment and Banking Solution. As the encryption keys are
unavailable to Fujitsu Services and Post Office, all data in scope of PCI DSS (Cardholder
Data and Account Data (P2PE)) for PBS Transactions are not accessible by Fujitsu Services
or Post Office as part of the transaction process. Access to encrypted PANs within the HNG-
X System does remain in relation to reconciliation however, this shall continue until
GlobalPayments, Vocalink and American Express implement changes to mask the PANs
communicated in reconciliation data. Unless explicitly stated otherwise in this Service
Description, no other Schedule B Schedule, Service Descriptions or CCDs shall apply to this
Payment and Banking Service.

3.2.1 The PBS Transaction Service Components
3.2.1.1 Ingenico Central Platform and Related Services

The Ingenico Central Platform is a network, hardware and software infrastructure,
including the AXIS Software, and transactional databases, centrally hosted and
operated in a fully redundant environment by Ingenico, ensuring the concentration
of PBS Transaction flows from Counter Positions, their processing links with the
Acquirers’ centres and the archiving of PBS Transaction history. This includes:

a) The configuration of acceptance contracts;

b) The routing of electronic PBS Transaction flows from Branch Hardware on
IP links;

c) Aggregation of PBS Transactions' data on central servers;

d) Delivery of PBS Transaction and authorisation data to (as applicable)
Acquirer centres and/or Vocalink;

e) The creation and transmission of settlement data to the Acquirer; and

f) Protection of card data exchanged and stored on the Ingenico Central
Platform according to the PCI DSS security rules.

3.2.1.1.1 Card types accepted

The types of cards accepted by the solution are detailed in the CCD entitled “Axis
Managed Payment Service Solution - Solution Design” (DES/APP/MAN/3760).

3.2.1.1.2 Multi-Acquirer Architecture

The PBS Transaction service is based on a multi-Acquirer architecture allowing the
configuration of multiple Acquirer contracts. Routing to different acquiring hosts
can be established via provisioning configuration. However, for the avoidance of
doubt, any change to Post Office Acquirer(s) or Vocalink must be made via the
Change Control Procedure, to ensure the change is adequately configured and tested
prior to release to the production environment.

3.2.1.1.3 Connectivity

The connectivity between the C3 Software and the Ingenico Central Platform is
based on TCP/IP protocol. The dialogues are always initiated by the C3 Software
towards the AXIS Sofiware server of the Ingenico Central Platform. The link
between the Ingenico Central Platform and the Acquirer may use the X25, XoT or
IP protocols via Ingenico's dedicated access points, depending on the connectivity
requirement of the Acquirer. The detailed connectivity infrastructure deployed is
detailed in the CCD entitled “Axis Managed Payment Service Solution - Solution
Design” (DES/APP/MAN/3760).

3.2.1.1.4  P2PE
The point to point encryption (P2PE) service enables card data encryption between
the PIN Pad and the Ingenico Central Platform. To enable this, PIN Pads must first

be activated in Ingenico's PCI-P2PE certified customisation centre and deployed
according to PCI P2PE rules.

Schedule I6 V15.0
Page 3 of 35
CONFIDENTIAL

FUJ00234943

FUJ00234943

The PIN Pad is activated by means of a P2PE encryption key injected according to
a PCI P2PE certified process, transported and deployed at Post Office sites
according to the rules defined by the PCI P2PE standard. The P2PE functionality
reduces the Post Office PCI DSS certification perimeter provided that Post Office
has implemented the P2PE Implementation Manual (PIM) issued by Fujitsu
Services and set out in the CRD entitled “P2PE Implementation Manual” ([@]), and
that Ingenico is referenced by the PCI-SSC as the P2PE compliant solution supplier.
Fujitsu Services shall maintain the certification on PIN Pads and a defined
application scope.

3.2.1.1.5 Asset Tracking via Web Portal

The P2PE Asset Management Service, as described in the CCD entitled “P2Pe Asset
Management Service: Service Description” (SVM/SDM/SD/3756) is accessed via
the Web Portal. It enables Post Office to manage the deployment of its PIN Pads
over their entire life cycle, from delivery to Post Office to being scrapped. This
service allows Post Office to manage the status specified in the P2PE
Implementation Manual (PIM), and to generate inventory discrepancies as required
by the PIM.

3.2.1.1.6 I Content Remote Download

The remote download feature allows the download, to all or part of the Post Office
estate of PIN Pads, of content specific to Post Office, such as logo, image, video,
ete. Post Office shall provide content for download to PIN Pads to Fujitsu Services
and define how the download campaign should progress, as part of service requests
for campaigns to be setup and initiated. Fujitsu Services will then ensure that the
content is downloaded to PIN Pads by Ingenico accordingly.

For information purposes only, Ingenico will initiate a campaign to coordinate any
specific downloads required to the PIN Pad estate. Each campaign will be designed
to the specific nature of the downloads being pushed to the PIN Pad estate, as this
could differ from a simple screensaver update, to a new version of a component
application on the PIN Pad.

Ingenico manages campaigns so that there are no more than approximately 200
concurrent PIN Pad downloads at any single point in time; however, there can be
multiple downloads over a single night to address more than 200 actual PIN Pads.
Any PIN Pad campaigns initiated will be subject to an agreed schedule with Post
Office.

3.2.1.1.7 CRM Tokenisation

3.2.1.1.8 — For every card seen by the Payment and Banking Solution, a CRM Token is

generated and returned on the first occasion, and looked up and returned
thereafter. The original PAN can only be discovered by looking the CRM
Token up using the CRM DeTokenisation API, as described in paragraph
3.2.1.5 of this Schedule 16, there is no key or algorithm to derive it.

FUJ00234943

The C3 CPA Software provides the interface between the in-Branch components
(Counter Position and PIN Pad application) and the AXIS Software servers of the
Ingenico Central Platform for EMV Payment Transaction processing. The C3 CPA
Software connects to the Ingenico Central Platform via TCP/IP.

.2.2 Protocols and supported countries

As part of the PBS Transaction service, the following countries and Acquirers'
protocols can be supported for EMV Payment Transactions:

Country Protocol

UK APACS

2.3. Payment environments

As part of the PBS Transaction service, the following payment mechanisms are
supported:

o InBranch payments

© Host to Host Refunds from Fujitsu Services’ HNG-X System, as defined in
the document entitled Horizon to Ingenico PBS payments Undo AIS
(REQ/APP/AIS/4044)

The latter allows HNG-X Application initiated refunds and reversals. Via an
interface between the HNG-X Application and the AXIS Software server of the
Ingenico Central Platform, automated reversals or refunds of EMV Payment
Transactions can be made In respect of EMV Payment Transactions which failed
or were cancelled, either at the Counter Position or otherwise by the HNG-X
System, after the EMV Payment Transaction.

2.4 Degraded Mode

This paragraph details the functionality provided by the Payment and Banking
Solution to support a degraded mode of operation. For the avoidance of doubt,
this functionality, whilst stated here is not configured for live operation for Post
Office. If required, this could be enabled for future operation using the Change
Control Procedure.

In the event of a failure of the communication between the C3 CPA Software and
the AXIS Software server of the Ingenico Central Platform, the Payment and
Banking Service may, according to an associated parameterization, continue to
operate in “degraded” mode: the C3 CPA Software, without access to any
communication with the AXIS Sofiware server of the Ingenico Central Platform,
must then process the EMV Payment Transaction locally, with a limit of behaviour
and amount defined between Post Office and the Acquirer. Any payment options
which can only be processed “online” with the Acquirer will not be supported in
“degraded” mode.

When operating in “degraded” mode, Post Office must note that the PIN Pad may
store EMV Payment Transactions locally. In order to be remitted to the bank, said
CONFIDENTIAL

FUJ00234943

FUJ00234943

EMV Payment Transactions must therefore be sent to the AXIS server of the
Ingenico Central Platform, before any replacement, maintenance or withdrawal of
such PIN Pad(s) is performed.

Post Office must ensure that all EMV Payment Transactions performed in
“degraded” mode, and therefore stored locally on the PIN Pad, can be sent to the
AXIS server of the Ingenico Central Platform, either by Post Office or its sub-
contractors or by Fujitsu Services, as soon as possible.

3.2.1.2.5 I CRM De-Tokenisation API

Provision of and support for a CRM De-Tokenisation API, use of which will allow
the original PAN associated with a CRM Token, provided by the CRM Tokenisation
facilities described in paragraph 3.2.1.1.7 of this Schedule 16, to be recovered. The
system from which this API is invoked should be assumed to be a CAT 1 PCI system
and subject to PCI DSS compliance. Post Office shall create a clean room facility
where this API will be housed and used. No provisioning or support of the clean
room, or any user interface associated with the clean room or API is included within
the Payment and Banking Service, or the other HNG-X Services.

For Post Office to use this CRM De-Tokenisation API in a live production
environment, it must evidence to Fujitsu Services an active Attestation of
Compliance (AoC) for PCIDSS. Post Office agrees to keep this certification up-to-
date, at its cost, for the Term of the Agreement and provide a copy of its most recent
Attestation of Compliance on renewal or on request from Fujitsu Services.”

3.2.1.2.6 Offline Mode

This paragraph details the functionality provided by the Payment and Banking
Solution to support an Offline Mode of operation. For the avoidance of doubt,
this functionality, whilst stated here is not configured for live operation for Post
Office. If required, this could be enabled for future operation using the Change
Control Procedure.

In the case of failure of the communication between the Ingenico Central Platform
and the computer system of the Acquiring centres, the payment application may,
according to the payment card processing rules, accept certain Transactions. It is
said that these EMV Payment Transactions are carried out “offline”.

Cards that require an authorisation request, with a required positive response from
the Acquirer centre, cannot be accepted in this mode of operation. Cards that do not
require authorisation may be accepted.

The acceptance of a card in “offline” processing must meet the acceptance rules of
the Acquirer and the issuer of the card.

3.2.1.3 The PBS Transaction Service for PBS Banking Transactions

3.2.1.3.1 C3 BTA Software

The C3 BTA Software provides the interface between the in-Branch components
(Counter Position and PIN Pad application) and the AXIS Sofiware servers of the

Schedule I6 V15.0

Page 6 of 35
FUJ00234943
FUJ00234943

(DES/APP/HLD/4410)), to the AXIS Server of the Ingenico Central Platform
(in accordance with the document entitled “Card Present API Functional
Specification” (REQ/APP/AIS/4114))

The latter allows HNG-X Application initiated banking reversals. Using an interface
between the HNG-X Application and the AXIS Server of the Ingenico Central
Platform, via sofiware managed by Post Office in Post Office Cloud, automated
reversals of PBS Banking Transactions can be made in respect of Transactions
which failed or were cancelled, either at the Counter Position or otherwise by the
HNG-X System, after the PBS Banking Transaction.

3.2.1.3.4  Multi-Acquirer Architecture

The PBS Transaction service is based on a multi-Acquirer architecture allowing the
configuration of multiple Acquirer contracts. However all PBS Banking
Transactions will be routed to Vocalink as the processing host.

3.2.1.3.5 Degraded mode

There is no Degraded Mode to support PBS Banking Transactions. In the event of a
failure of the communication between the C3 BTA Software and the AXIS server
of the Ingenico Central Platform, PBS Banking Transactions will not be accepted as
all PBS Banking Transactions must be performed fully online to the Vocalink host.

3.2.1.3.6 Offline mode

There is no Offline Mode to support PBS Banking Transactions. In the case of
failure of the communication between the Ingenico Central Platform and the

3.4

The PBS Transaction service elements of the Payment and Banking Service shall be available
twenty-four (24) hours per day, every day of the year to support and enable Post Office
Branches in making EMV Payment Transactions and PBS Banking Transactions at any time;
subject to any agreed unavailability due to scheduled changes as described in paragraph 3.2.5
of this Service Description and within the availability Service Level Targets as documented
in paragraph 3.4 of this Service Description.

For recording and responding to P3 Incidents and Service Requests the hours of operation are
Monday - Friday (excluding Bank Holidays) 8am - 8pm, Saturday - 8am - Spm, Sunday - No
cover, Bank Holidays (excluding Christmas Day) 8am - 2pm. The Payment and Banking
Service will record and respond to P1 & P2 Incidents at all times.

All other service elements of the Payment and Banking Service will be provided between
09:00 and 17:30, Monday to Friday excluding Bank Holidays.

Service Level Targets and Remedies
All Service Levels and Key Performance Indicators will be measured over a calendar month.

The Service Level Targets in the remainder of this paragraph which relate to an Incident shall
be measured from the point at which that Incident is received by Ingenico. Fujitsu Services
shall route Incidents or other Payment and Banking Service needs to Ingenico promptly and
efficiently for Payment and Banking Service (having regard to the severity of the Incident and
relevant response and resolution times) but in any event no later than fifteen (15) minutes after
assessing that Ingenico are the appropriate party for resolution), within the usual working
practices of the other HNG-X Services.

3.4.1 Transaction Performance of the Ingenico
Central Platform

The performance of the Ingenico Central Platform shall be calculated by measuring the
transaction processing time for EMV Payment and PBS Banking Transactions. This shall be
measured as follows:

e¢ For EMV Payment Transactions. This shall be measured as transit time from receipt
at the perimeter of the network ingress point of the Ingenico Central Platform to
despatch of authorisation response to the PIN Pad from the network egress point of
the Ingenico Central Platform, minus any time taken from the Acquirer(s) to provide
a response back to the Ingenico Central Platform. This shall be measured as the
average EMV Payment Transaction processing time over a calendar month.

e For PBS Banking Transactions. This shall be measured as transit time from receipt at
the perimeter of the network ingress point of the Ingenico Central Platform to
despatch of authorisation response to the PIN Pad from the network egress point of
the Ingenico Central Platform, minus anytime taken from Vocalink to provide a
response back to the Ingenico Central Platform. This shall be measured as the average
PBS Banking Transaction processing time over a calendar month.

Fujitsu Services shall process EMV Payment Transactions and PBS Banking Transactions on
the Ingenico Central Platform within the following timeframes:

Schedule I6 V15.0

FUJ00234943

CONFIDENTIAL
Average of all EMV Payment Transactions processed over a =< 2.0 seconds
calendar month
Average of all PBS Banking Transactions processed over a =< 2.0 seconds

The transaction processing time Service Level Target for PBS Banking Transactions is an
SLT that Fujitsu Services are committed to achieving. This could not be finalised until
development, testing and piloting of the Payment and Banking Solution in a Live Production
environment was completed. This Service Level Target was reviewed and agreed as part of
progressing beyond Payment and Banking Service Acceptance.

Table I in paragraph 3.4.10 of this Service Description adds further detail to the above Service
Level Target, in which:

e SLA-EMV1.1 relates to the processing of EMV Payment Transactions against this
transaction processing time SLT.

¢ SLA-BANK1.2 relates to the processing of PBS Banking Transactions against this
transaction processing time SLT.

¢ Both SLA-EMVI.1 and SLA-BANK1.2 will be reported over a calendar month,
however only SLA-BANK1.2 will be subject to liquidated damages.

3.4.1.1 Exclusions.

The following events are excluded from measuring the performance of the Ingenico
Central Platform:

a) any failures of applications which are not maintained or provided by Fujitsu
Services or its Subcontractors that impact the Payment and Banking
Solution receiving a correctly formatted request to process a PBS Banking
or EMV Payment Transaction;

b) any failures of integration with third party components resulting from
changes that are not covered by an approved Operational Change Proposal
or CWO; and

c) any network connectivity issue resulting from any failure or degradation of
service, including the inability of PIN Pads to connect to the Ingenico
Central Platform, other than where such connectivity failure results from an
act, omission or breach by Fujitsu Services;

3.4.2 Availability of the Ingenico Central Platform

The Ingenico Central Platform will be available, to support and enable Post Office Branches
in making EMV Payment Transactions and PBS Banking Transactions (subject to any agreed
unavailability due to scheduled changes as described in paragraph 3.2.5 of this Service
Description) for at least the availability of the Service Level Target below.

The Service Level Target for availability of the Ingenico Central Platform within the PBS
Core Availability hours measured over a calendar month is as follows:

cal

Availability of the INGENCIO Central Platform over a I 99.95% Availability

lendar month

The availability will be recorded and monitored using Ingenico's Incident management
systems (Incident ticket and monitoring tools).

The availability target is applicable to the Ingenico Central Platform that supports both EMV
Payment and PBS Banking Transactions.

Schedule I6 V15.0
Page 16 of 35

3.4.2.1 Calculating Availability for EMV Payment Transactions and PBS
Banking Transactions

An unsuccessful EMV Payment Transaction or PBS Banking Transaction is a PBS
Transaction for which the Ingenico Central Platform does not, receive the
authorisation or decline (as applicable) due to an Ingenico system issue.

The current configuration of the Payment and Banking Solution does not enable
offline mode or degraded mode for EMV Payment Transactions. Hence, the
availability rate described below is a combined measure for EMV Payment and PBS
Banking Transactions. Should Post Office request to enable these features in the
future for EMV Payment Transactions using the Change Control Procedure, then
these availability rate calculations will be modified to bring this into effect.

The availability rate of the Ingenico Central Platform for successful EMV Payment
and PBS Banking Transactions, against all PBS Transactions (excluding Exclusions,
as described in paragraph 3.4.2.2 below), shall be calculated as;

A= TSH — TUDT 100
TSH

Where;
A= % of Availability over a calendar month

TSH = Total Service Hours (total time within Core Availability Hours in the
calendar month - Exclusions)

TUDT = Total unscheduled downtime (i.e. duration of all Incidents in period)
(hours)

Table 1 in paragraph 3.4.10 of this Service Description adds further detail to the
above Service Level Target, detailing it as; SLA2.1, SLA2.2, SLA2.3 and SLA2.4
for availability for EMV Payment Transactions; and SLA2.5, SLA2.6, SLA2.7 and
SLA2.8 for PBS Banking Transactions.

The following examples are based on a 229h per calendar month period, using June
2020 as an example reporting period.

Example 1:

A total of 1-hour Incident duration in a calendar month.

Total Service Hours: 229
FUJ00234943
FUJ00234943

CONFIDENTIAL

Incident Duration: I Hour

Service Availability: (229 - 1)/229 = 99.56% availability; (SLA2.3
breached)

Example 2:

A total of 5 minutes Incident duration in a calendar month.
Total Service Hours: 229
Incident Duration: 5 minutes (0.083 hours)

Service Availability: (229 - 0.083))/229 = 99.96% availability (no
applicable SLA breached)

3.4.2.2 Exclusions.

The following events are excluded from measuring the availability of the Ingenico
Central Platform:

a) scheduled downtime, which shall refer to any unavailability due to
scheduled changes made in accordance with the process as described in
paragraph 3.2.5 of this Service Description;

b) any failures of applications (other than the Ingenico Central Platform) used
by Post Office which are not maintained or provided by Ingenico and which
cause the unavailability of the Ingenico Central Platform;

c) any failures of integration with third party components resulting from
changes made by Post Office outside the Change Control Procedure and
which cause the unavailability of the Ingenico Central Platform; and

d) any network connectivity issue resulting from Vocalink or Post Office
connectivity supplier failure, including the inability of PIN Pads to connect
to the Ingenico Central Platform, other than where such connectivity failure
results from an act, omission or breach by Fujitsu Services.

3.4.3 Settlement File Generation and Transmitting

Fujitsu Services (acting via Ingenico) shall submit all settlement files of EMV Payment
Transactions to the Acquirer by the Acquirer cut off times specified in the CCD entitled “Axis
Managed Payment Service Solution - Solution Design” (DES/APP/MAN/3760). The cut-off
point for processing EMV Payment Transactions for daily settlement data generation will be
approximately 19:00, and will submit the Settlement file to GlobalPayments by 04:00 the next
day. Any change to this time or to the Acquirer will be addressed using the Change Control
Procedure.

Ingenico shall submit the settlement files to each Acquirer by such time which allows them
to re-attempt the submission if the first attempt fails. If both attempts fail Fujitsu Services will
notify Post Office of the failure in writing.

Fujitsu Service will notify Post Office on the same Working Day if confirmation of receipt of
the settlement files by individual Acquirers (where Acquirers commit to return confirmations)
is not received by 08.00hrs.
