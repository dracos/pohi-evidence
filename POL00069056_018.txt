a Subject: Gaerwen 160604 Mr H N Thomas

Just to confirm the above Spmr's contract for services has been terminated following his recent
suspension. My undwerstanding is that Mrs Amanda Rowlands the original applicant following his earlier
resignation has agreed a buyout with Mr Thomas. She is to write in to confirm this and we can then try to
make arrangements to restore a counter service to the village .
