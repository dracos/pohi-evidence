- Board Update

- _ Ask for Board’s approval on the approach for Post Office on KELs issue

- Rod W to amend the update for Board

- Legal advice — rights against Fujistu are conditional on understanding whether there is any
adverse finding on Post Office

- Board are particularly interested in the update of the KELs and our rights against FJ

- Comms position — proactive or reactive

-  PB—Following the CMC and the view that we are serious about settlement, does the comms
issue need to be re-evaluated

- AW-Board wanted to change attitude and directions for Post Office comms, are they now
satisfied we have achieved this, or do we need to say something specifically and if so, what do
we say. Something to consider at Board meeting on Tuesday 29 October

- Advice to Board is we shouldn’t be doing a proactive approach

- Can PB provide a couple of bullet points on this advice

Cost Budgeting (hearing yesterday 23.10.19)
Counsel highlighted KEL issue, J.Fraser has said 24 hour notice will be given before draft
judgment
- Large part of budget was agreed, the only outstanding issue was level of costs Post Office
proposed to spend on settlement (we proposed £700,000, they wanted to give us £300,000)
- Ultimate position is settlement is £400,000
- Comments were made such as J.Fraser surprised at costs incurred for pleadings, risk of engaging

two law firms
