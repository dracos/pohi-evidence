lPM-CS Require Formal Route to EDS/DSS via PON

pathway CS do not have a formal route through PON to EDS who operate the
IESNCS system at the DSS Washington.

Recent CHANGE to OAS.

le recently had difficulty in getting a FIX for CI4 that was required to the
AS (OBCS Access System)system that resides in the ESNCS system at the DSS
lashington. The issues were 1. The contact routes, unclear as we ended up
talking to sevearl people in DSS and EDS, eventually it was John Lees at
uyhtam who took responsibility and raised the AR (Activity Request) to
lapprove the change at the DSS and the sanction for EDS to get the change
jone. 2.The delivery method of the fix, eventually agreed with EDS to use the
lest Delivery method from the TEST Sequent box in Feltham and deliver to the
IESNCS test system NLE 019 in Washington. delivery method OK but need to
lunderstand if we need to keep this available for any future change.

n~Going Support/Opeartional issues.

ith the growth of the transaction file going back from pathway to the ESNCS
system we initially had volume size problems in that EDS had NOT made the
required File Store available to get the files across. this was resolved
after a meeting with Mike Hannon, Liz Darbon & Ijaz Bhatti- EDS made more
store available. Also there was an issue around the changing of PASSWORDs
levery 30 days, EDS change but dont inform Pathway VME support team in Belfast
jpf the change. Current issues are that the STORE is running out again as the
file has increased significantly and the passwords are still being changed
ithout notification. Actions Pathway could take are to limit the number of
lays of files held to 6 rather than the 7 by getting Housekeeping each day to
\delete the prevoius 7th day, thus making more store available........this
411 yesult in a CHANGE and would presumably suffer the same problems as
kirst listed. Pathway could take control of the PASSWORDS from EDS again this
jould require a change or AR.

[fhe other main issue that is currently effecting the OPERATION is that the
FILE size on a MONDAY night has now grown bigger than the 131mb limited set
lby VME as a file transfer, we are currently having to get a memeber of the
support team on-site at Belfast at midnight to get the file sent manually.
fhe fix for this is being developed within ICL/HPS for the fix to VME. So
hen this is ready there will need to be the change applied to the EDS Vme
system, so again we need to understand the route for the deivery and
installing of the fix.

Pathway Cs feels it has NO DEFINED ROUTE via PON to the DSS/EDS for these
issues.

jould ask PON SM to take on as a problem to define the correst route and
jprodedure asthe DSS are their customer.
