Subject: First draft Statement of Gareth Jenkins (Post Office Limited -v- Lee Castleton)

i” ‘Tom Beezer; rmorgan@

Dear Brian,

I refer to our previous correspondence and attach the first version of a draft witness statement
and Exhibit for Gareth Jenkins. This is designed to:

1. Explain what Horizon is; and
2. Comment on Mr Castleton's allegations about the Horizon system.

Iam preparing a separate statement for Ann (to follow shortly) which will deal with the call
logs.

Please can Gareth have a look at the first draft, make any changes he feels are appropriate and
also answer my questions in bold italics. Once I get feedback from Gareth, I will then revise
the statement with Counsel.

I look forward to hearing from you or Gareth as soon as possible.

Kind regards.

Stephen Dilley
Solicitor
