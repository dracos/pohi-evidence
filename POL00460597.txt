It will be important for POL to demonstrate to the Inquiry that measures have been put in place to prevent
the same issues being repeated as well as what it is doing by way of continual monitoring and improvement.

It is recognised that there is cross over between some of the topics.

a) what improvements have been made across POL from 2000 -— to date,
b) anything further that POL has put in place or intends to put in place going forwards.
c) how POLis or proposes to ensure areas to ensure that history does not

repeat itself and to test how effective the change(s) have been.
d) the commitments it has made to learn lessons and make changes

e) the work undertaken by POL to date, further work that is required in each area and identify documents that may
assist in drafting narrative documents.

Common Issues Judgement

OBJECTIVE & APPROACH

* To review the status of actions implemented to address / remediate issues
raised within the Common Issues Judgement.

+ Accritical approach applied to assess evidence from a sustainability perspective
and identify further risks or areas of improvement from a POL and/or
Postmaster lens to prevent detriment and ensure appropriate governance /
oversight.

ASSURANCE OPINION

+ Anumber of challenges had to be overcome and considerable time invested with
the Retail team prior and during the review, this however has resulted in the
following benefits for POL:

+ Single universe of actions (365), clearer ownership / risk articulation.
+ Central repository of evidence, incl. links to sites, clearly tagged to CU:

o 1,594 evidence items, and access to 53 live sites (containing policies,
processes, documents, MI, and access to live systems such as Power BI
Dashboards).

o This should now be used for continuous assurance and support Inquiry
preparati

Retail have completed majority of the Cl actions (97%). This in isolation is a
considerable achievement, given the cost challenges, changes to personnel, team
structures etc.

That said, and as mentioned above, our review has gone beyond the evidence, to

review with a critical lens whether the actions are sustainable, can demonstrate or

track the impacts on PMs, and where applicable, there is appropriate oversight
and governance. With this context we have identified a number of significant

improvement opportunities:

Common Issues Judgement — Key drivers of Assurance Opinion 1/3

« Some original actions have not been completed or partially completed, for example:
o Loss Recovery process has not been implemented
o Stock Auto Rem and Stock Auto Replenishment - due to lack of funding
o Refresher training is partially completed.

o Discrepancies from returned stock is partially complete

o Fundamental thematic themes emerge which either negate the impact of the actions completed or lead to ineffective oversight of these:

co -MI, Dashboards and Reporting (thematic across all ClJ)
+ Whilst the Retail Team have considerable data, MI and dashboards it is very challenging to assess (on an E2E basis) what the overall impact

has been of the actions delivered for ClJ.
* It is unclear how KRI’s, KPI’s and exceptions are tracked holistically or triggered for escalations to ensure timely visibility, and appropriate
governance, for example, the Complaints Dashboard does not provide qualitative information particularly in relation to Branch Assurance Reviews

and Transaction corrections, to indicate if postmasters are seeing a positive change on the ground or not or whether a positive impact in a process

is not negated by any other process (E2E view).
* The GE receive on a regular basis a ClJ dashboard, this in our opinion therefore requires a revamp and should be created with a E2E view of the

PM journeys or akin to a balanced scorecard that many consumer facing organisations have to measure their impact and protection of consumers.
o Root Cause Analysis (thematic across all ClJ)
* Whilst causes or buckets of errors is captured for Transaction Corrections, root cause analysis is not currently used and or reported to support

understanding of why issues/errors are occurring. We believe outcomes of this type of analysis could be used to improve training and support.

POL00460597
Post Office Limited - Document Classification: CONFIDENTIAL

Common Issues Judgement — Key drivers of Assurance Opinion 2/3

o Quality Assurance (QA)

* QA processed are being used/introduced to various teams within Retail such as Branch Assurance and Transaction Corrections and Disputes,
this is a positive step to provide assurance on activities completed by these teams. And should therefore be closely monitored to ensure these
are embedded.

* Scripts have been introduced to ensure a consistent approach to contact with Postmasters, and a call recording system has been implemented
allowing call monitoring to take place. However, in some instances, calls made via mobile phones cannot be recorded and therefore not able
to be monitored.

* PM Suspension payments are calculated by Finance however these are not independently checked to ensure the accuracy and or completeness

of the Remuneration components.

o Loss Recovery and Investigations
* Based on the current approach to loss recovery for losses that have been investigated and found to be genuine losses, POL is treating
postmasters differently. Some Postmasters are not engaging with POL on losses and are not repaying them whilst other Postmasters
who do engage with POL are repaying losses.
* Additionally, discrepancy cases identified following Branch Assurance reviews are not prioritised for investigation, not prioritising cases may

mean the suspension time is extended unreasonably.

POL00460597
Post Office Limited - Document Classification: CONFIDENTIAL

Common Issues Judgement — Key drivers of Assurance Opinion 3/3

o Other Thematics
+ A standardised approach to document control (incl. version control) needs to be adopted across the Retail team to ensure POL can
demonstrate changes (or no changes) and evolutions to key processes and procedures.
+ Postmaster Support policies - this action has been picked up in ClJ areas where policies are mentioned, however overall, there needs to
be a process or KPI's/metrics to assess the effectiveness and compliance to all Postmaster policies.
+ Effectiveness of Key Support roles

* Conflicts in Decision making — Retail org design

o Other Actions - In addition to the Thematics, 29 additional actions were identified from the findings in each of the individual ClJ areas:
o Onboarding - 2
o Training -6
o Branch Assurance - 4
o Central Ops - 8
o Retail / Retail Ops - 8

Postmaster Support Policies

OBJECTIVE

To understand, test and gain assurance based on
some point of control testing that the Postmaster
Support policies are working, complied with and fit
for purpose.

Whilst there is a close alignment with CU reviews,
and we have aligned both reviews where possible,
the approach of the Postmaster policy reviews was
fundamentally more myopic and did not apply a E2E
view of the POL universe.

Outcomes
eThe pol

ies themselves are generally fit for
purpose, however to demonstrate effective
compliance, significant improvements would be
needed in areas such as:

O Policy monitoring and oversight.

O KPI and or KRIs

O Clearer articulation, assessment and monitoring of

Speak Up

OBJECTIVE

The objective of the review was to assess the level of Speak Up process
compliance, when dealing with Speak Up cases.

SCOPE & APPROACH

+ Asample of 10 Speak Up cases (raised between April 2022 — January 2023)
were reviewed against Speak Up policies and procedures and focussing on:
* Security and access of ‘Speak Up’ data — especially maintaining
confidentiality/anonymity
+ Effectiveness of Speak Up communications
* Speak Up monitoring and governance
+ Effectiveness of Speak Up training

Assurance Conclusion:

The Speak Up team was established approximately 18 months ago and during this
period, the team have invested heavily in reviewing and updating processes and
procedures and have also introduced monitoring dashboards for Speak Up which is
reported to Group Executives and Board members monthly.

Whilst being a relatively new team, they are embedding robust processes and
procedures, and have a culture of continuous improvement.

Consequently, our opinion is that the overall control environment is Satisfactory.

Complex Investigation Unit (CIU)
OBJECTIVE

The core objective of the review was to assess the level of process
compliance in accordance with the Group Investigations and Co-

operation with Law Enforcement Policy (GICLE) and the Investigators
Manual.

-SCOPE & APPROACH

* Our work sampled 8 investigations performed by the CIU team (over
2022 and 2023). For clarity this review excluded the CIU Assurance
activities over Retail Investigations

Assurance Conclusion

The CIU team actively and constructively engaged with our assurance review, and they are overtly aware of the Common Issue
Judgements.

Their intent and approach in ensuring mistakes of the past are not repeated can clearly be evidenced not only in their revised set of
processes and procedures, but also in the positive behaviours and culture they are trying to embed within CIU and across POL.

Significant improvement reflects CIU to be alate to demonstrate adherence to their brocesses and cele such as:

«Evidence to demonstrate Head a a a b aintained within CIU case
files, for example, triage criteria, case closure, criminal investigation, eoniiles etc.

Meetings with CIU staff anecdotally show that review meetings are held twice a week on cases, these are not reflected in
casefile9s).

eUse and completion of key CIU documents need to be embedded consistently, such as the Combined strategy/investigation
strategy document and Investigation Control Document, or their non-use formally explained.

eCase and file structures have only recently been adopting a consistent approach therefore for older investigation (2022)
navigating case files is challenging.

Group Assurance acknowledge that this is mainly due to the fact that the team is newly formed, with processes still being created
land embedded, compounded by a heavy CIU workload.

Inquiry (Rule 9)

OUTCOME
Documentary evidence to demonstrate compliance with processes and procedures could not be
provided. Gaps related to application of POL governance and oversight, and assessment of completeness and accuracy.

Fundamental weaknesses in the control environment were identified such that management of key
inherent risks and associated design and execution of controls was unsatisfactory.

Opinion - the risk of inaccuracy or omissions cannot be ruled out for Rule 9 requests covered in our sample period.

KEY THEMATICS AND FINDINGS

Based on the Rule 9 samples:

- Lack of clear consistency and governance around storage and traceability of documentation for Rule9 requests though their lifecycle
- Roles, Responsibilities and Ownership for Rule 9 process and governance were not clearly defined.

Suspension remediation review (at request of HM Director)

POL00460597
POL00460597

OBJECTIVE

roup Assurance have performed a review of Post Office’s Suspension
Remediation Review processes and procedures to assess

he robustness of their control environment.

SCOPE & APPROACH

The Assurance Team performed a desk top review of the Historical
Matters Suspension Payment Processes to identify key inherent risk
and expected controls.

A sample of three Suspension Payments was then selected to perform
a walkthrough to assess the effectiveness of controls.

This review was performed during June 2023, and therefore our
opinions and comments reflect the state of the control environment
during this period.

RED - UNSATISFACTORY

STATUS OF ACTIONS

The status of the 10 actions identified at the time of fieldwork,
are summarised below:

+ Four resolved via Legacy team board paper

* Five changes to tightening the process completed

* One was already in place and being completed

Pause Payments

OBJECTIVE
Objectively assess whether HM Legal’s recommendation to continue to receive payments in connection to 21 PM cases deemed as low/medium
was appropriate based on the evidence available.

APPROACH
Group Assurance reviewed a sample of six cases:
e twocases were randomly selected from the three categories - Apparent Dishonesty, Apparent NCE and CC).

All documentary evidence provided by HM Legal was reviewed for the six samples selected.

ASSURANCE OPINION
The process used by the HM Legal team to complete and document their assessment to continue recoveries of losses for 21 cases involving PMs
is very methodical with good file structures and a clear application of logic to categorise the risk classifications.

That said our review has highlighted the following risks that management need to carefully consider prior to assessing whether recoveries

should continue or be paused:

+ Itis unclear whether the POL individuals involved in these cases (audit, investigation, and security teams) and the processes and practices
they adopted (dates range from 2006 to 2020) were similar to those that led to incorrect historical convictions.

+ The level of documentation varied for the cases reviewed, in two cases (both CCJ) there was significantly less documentation.

+ In cases where there was genuine theft perpetrated by third parties, it is unclear how POL discharged its duty of care to Postmasters. No
evidence exists of POL employees advising the Postmasters to contact the police and/or check if they had Business insurance to cover such
losses.

Consequently, in our opinion the associated risk in continuing to recover outstanding balances in relation to the 21 cases is extremely high.

and the reputational risk outweighs the financial benefit.

The Review consisted of:

+ Assessing responses to 95 assurance questions including
evidence; and

+ Review of 8 randomly selected claims.

Significant improvements were identified, and the report was

on the table to the right.

Whilst the ARC signed off on circa 10
areas we have gone beyond these to
ensure all interdependencies are
captured.

The universe once completed will remain

The allocation of P1, P2 and P3 classifications

will need to be confirmed by the identified by

Risk definitions

e P1- Quarterly — If no assurance is undertaken, this could have an immediate and significant material effect on operational processes
and impact the Postmaster detrimentally.

. P2 - Bi-annually — These risks are not time critical however if no assurance is undertaken, the consequence of the risk materialising may
not be immediate but could still affect operational processes and impact the Postmaster.

. P3 - Annually - These risks are not time critical and less significant, however if no assurance is undertaken, the consequence of the risk
materialising may impact on operational processes causing Postmaster detriment.

In Q4 there are likely to be reduced number of lines as we have matched actions from the ClJ review to the Universe

risks.

For example, there are 3 x P1 risks and 1 x P2 risk in CU 2 (Training) but these are aligned to actions with an end date
of 31/3/24. This means that these lines will not be included in the final Q4 numbers. Once the actions are marked as

complete, these lines will be tested in the following quarter.

Retail Universe Workplan

The workplan has been created using:

¢ Information gathered from the Retail teams (feedback from the Universe shared)

* The universe is now aligned (continue to be so iteratively) with
« AC&l team on the Quality Assurance activity we have removed duplications which they are focussed on
¢ Other assurance activities such as Compliance and Internal Audit.

How owners were identified

Collating the information provided we have allocated responsibilities as follows:
* Yellow — information to be provided by the Retail team(s)

* Pale Green - Group Assurance led activities

* Blue — Outcome of Compliance and Internal Audit assurance

* Beige - AC&l

(As defined within the Retail work plan)
