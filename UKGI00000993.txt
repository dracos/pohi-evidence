Hi Richard,

Jeremy is now seeing Tim Parker next Tuesday - the meeting got pushed back and back, but I think we should
keep it this time.

Could you provide a brief on the latest - for 3pm Monday? As well as the latest on funding, also helpful to
have context on performance etc, and any other interactions with HMG. Usual format below.

Very happy to discuss, and do say if best to go to BEIS for this overall - I can ask them to get your input on the
funding point.

Thanks,

Emily.

Hi Richard

Yes Jeremy is scheduled to meet with Tom Parker next Thursday, sadly but this meeting now clashes with a
PM meeting that Jeremy must attend. I will be rescheduling the Tom Parker meeting to later in March /
April and I will let you know once I have confirmed a date and time.

Thave cc'd Emily, the PS who will be leading on this meeting. Emily is on leave next week but will be in
touch to discuss briefing requirements on her return

Kind regards

Dear Richard

Tam covering in Jeremy's office for the next two weeks whilst Emma his diary manager is on annual
leave. As yet a meeting has not been scheduled with Tim Parker, Chair of POL but Jeremy has said it
would be good to catch up with him, so a meeting will be added to the diary in the next few weeks.

I will let you know once I have confirmed the meeting in the diary.

Kindest regards

Dear PS Heywood

I lead the Post Office Limited (POL) shareholder team at UK Government Investments. I understand that
Jeremy Heywood has agreed to meet the Chair of POL, Tim Parker, to discuss their future funding needs.

I would be grateful if you could let me know when the meeting has been arranged for, so that we can
provide an update on the funding process when appropriate. Mark Russell (CEO of UKGI) is very keen to

ensure that HMG remains joined up in our messaging to POL, particularly as negotiations between BEIS
and HMT are at a delicate stage.

Happy to discuss, kind regards
