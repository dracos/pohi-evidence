3.1. OBCS

The incident of the failure in the ICL Pathway “Maestro” Scheduling
environment which occurred on Saturday 8 November appeared to be an
isolated incident, which was not repeated on the following Saturday. OSM will
continue to monitor.

3.2 ABED

This week there has not been a repetition of files being sent with the wrong
creation date.

At this stage, it is interesting to note that the number of late pollings are .
beginning to increase, this will be monitored at the ABED interface to analyse
the effect on their’ processes. :

An item of deep concern is that ICL Pathway have reported two incidences of
duplicate payments being made, however, this has not been evident from any
reports received, and ABED are awaiting further details.

There is cause for concern regarding the number and unusual types of
incidents occurring, given that ‘Congo 4’ is rolling out to a relatively small
number of outlets and with limited functionality.
