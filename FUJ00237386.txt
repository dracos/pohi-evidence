Hi Pete,

Thank you for your time yesterday. I picked up an action to send through the extract from Second Sight’s Interim
Report- which alludes to have being 3 bugs. This is pasted below.

I realise, we are going over old ground, but I would be keen to put a line in the sand and once and for all, pull together
the definitive detail on each of these bugs.

Clearly SS have been provided information in relation to Bugs 1 & 2 — do you have a copy of what they were provided
with and how these were captured in the TFS or PEAK systems?

I have attached what I have in relation to Bug 1 & also Bug 3 (see para 23 of attachment 2). I have also attached a
prior email chain we had in relation to Bug 1 — the only question that I do not think we got to bottom of in respect of

that email chain is the Pilot number of branches in Q1 2010.

Basically what I am after is, as much information as possible about each of the 3 bugs. Do not fear, once supplied, this
information will be filed religiously so that the pain will never have to be revisisted.

Thank you for your patience!

Mark

“The first defect, referred to as the "Receipts and Payments Mismatch Problem", impacted 62 branches. It was
FUJ00237386
FUJ00237386

discovered in September 2010 as a result of Fujitsu's monitoring of system events

(although there were subsequent calls from branches). The aggregate of the discrepancies arising from this system
defect was £9,029, the largest shortfall being £777 and the largest surplus £7,044.

POL has informed us that all shortages were addressed at no loss to any SPMR.

6.6. The second defect, referred to as the "Local Suspense Account Problem", affected 14 branches, and generated
discrepancies totalling £4,486, including a temporary shortfall of £9,800 at one branch and a surplus of £3,200 at
another (the remaining 12 branches were all impacted by amounts of less than £161).

6.7. POL was unaware of this second defect until, a year after its first occurrence in 2011, it re-occurred and an
unexplained shortfall was reported by an SPMR.

6.8. POL's initial investigations in 2012 failed to reveal the system defect and, because the cause could not be
identified, the amount was written off. Fujitsu looked into the matter early in 2013 and discovered, and then
corrected, the defect.

6.9. It seems however, that the shortfalls (and surpluses) that occurred at the first occurrence (in 2011) resulted in
branches being asked to make good incorrect amounts.

6.10. POL has informed us that it has disclosed, in Witness Statements to English Courts, information about one other
subsequently-corrected defect or “bug” in the Horizon software.”
