Answers are

1. PO don't have direct access to Audit servers
2. ARQ process provides copy of data as required

Please check what was written originally so we don't contradict.

Andy,

I'll check the factfile this evening but just in case I don’t find anything would you mind asking the question
first thing tomorrow so that I have the answer before the WG meeting.

Thanks,
Angela

Do you have the original factfile doc, I am sure there was a response in there, we need to be consistent to that. I am
on my bb and its taking a while download.

I can ask Fujitsu tomorrow or John Scott as I don't know for sure what the answer is. I think the only access to this is
via ARQ requests (which you could claim is read only but is not like standard system access, which SS suggest)

Does that help at all?

Andy,

Below is an extract of what SS has put into our factfile report. Could you confirm whether this statement is
accurate.

Horizon records all data centrally in the Branch Database in the Post Office Data Centre and a copy of all
transactions is also made to a separate audit server where they are stored independently. We have been
told that a limited number of security personnel at Post Office have read-only access to this audit server.

Thanks,
Angela
