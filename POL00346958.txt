Hello all,

I have tried to call you Rod - attached a Draft Summary of actions arising from Deloittes recent piece of work on the
Horizon systems.

Clearly there is no blame attached anywhere, and this morning’s meeting with Chris Day, Chris Aujard, Lesley and
Malcolm — focussed on what we would need to put in place as an organisation to address overall assurance on all critical

systems, starting with Horizon from 1* April.

Detailing appropriate industry standards and controls our business should be following against a risk based priority
mechanism.

Rod we would be happy to come to Chesterfield, however it would be better (more cost effective) if we could have a
morning or afternoon in the next week or so at Old Street.

We 4 will need to be comfortable that we have a plan going forward including indicative costs of undertaking for Risk
and Compliance Committee on 21 July.

We will need to engage with the Exco members attached to verify and agree to support prior to the committee meeting.
Gina can you arrange a meeting between Rod Dave Malcolm and myself?

Thanks
