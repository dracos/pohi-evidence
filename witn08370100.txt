                  POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY




           FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF PHILIP GERRISH




      TRODUCTION


   I, PHILIP GERRISH will say as follows:


1, This written witness statement has been drafted in response to the Rule 9

   request dated April 14th 2023 and supplementary questions sent to me on

   May 16th 2023 regarding involvement in action taken against Sub-

   Postmasters by Post Office Ltd, as part of Phase 4 of the Post Office Horizon

   IT Inquiry ("the Inquiry").


Relevant background


2. I originally joined the Post Office as a counter clerk in the City of London in

   1980. In 1988 I joined the Post Office Investigation Department (POID) as an

   Assistant Investigation Officer. I was promoted to Investigation Officer in 1989.

    investigated suspected or detected crime across the whole business

   including, predominantly, the mail, parcels and counters networks. In 1996

                                                                                     GRO
                                                                                   WITNO8370100
                                                                                  WITNO8370100




  following the Review of Corporate Centre (ROCC) I transferred across to Post

   Office Counters (POCL) as an Investigation Manager in the South East

  Region. In circa late 1998, to the best of my recollection, I was temporarily

   promoted to Regional Security and Investigation Manager (RSIM) in the

  POOL South East Region and subsequently seconded to the Shaping for

   Competitive Success project (SCS) in the following year. In October 1999 I

   was appointed Territory Security Manager (TSM) for the Post Office Network

  (PON) East Territory. Again, to the best of my recollection, sometime in 2002

   following an internal re-organisation, I was appointed National Internal Crime

   and Investigation Manager for PON. I left Post Office Limited (POL) in 2004

   when I was appointed Head of Investigation for Royal Mail and Group. This

   role did not include any responsibilities or accountabilities involving Post

   Office Ltd or Parcelforce Worldwide (PFW) which both had their own Heads of

   Security and embedded Security and Investigation teams. I subsequently

   became Director of Investigations Royal Mail and Group. I retired in 2015.



3. Between 1996 and 1998 1 was one of three Investigation Managers within the

   POOL South East Region investigating suspected or detected crime against

   the Post Office. I covered Kent and East Sussex. As the temporary RSIM for

   POOL South East in addition to the Investigation function I was also

   responsible for 3 CM2 IDs, 3 Security Managers and the physical and

   procedural security inspections and investment for all outlets (branch and sub

   offices) within the Region. Between 1999 and 2002, as the TSM for the East

   Territory, I lead the team that investigated crime against PON/POL in that area

   and managed physical and procedural security standards inspections and

                                                                                   WITNO8370100
                                                                               WITNO8370100




   investment across that Territory. Between 2002 and leaving POL in 2004 as

   National Internal Crime and Investigation Manager I led the team responsible

   for investigating internal crime across the whole Post Office Network including

   Scotland and Northern Ireland. POL did not bring prosecutions in Scotland or

   Northern Ireland. In Scotland cases were submitted to the Procurator Fiscal

   (PF) and in Northern Ireland the Public Prosecution Service Northern Ireland

   (PPSNI) following its inception and before that the Police. I have been asked

   to consider which was the most effective system. I cannot comment. I only

   had personal experience of the English system.



The policies/practices in place relating to criminal investigation and
prosecution



4. Between 1989 and 1993 (as an Investigation Officer) and 1996 and 1998 (as

   an Investigation Manager) POOL I worked in defined geographical areas;

   formerly in East London and Essex and latterly in Kent and East Sussex,

   investigating suspected or detected crime committed against the Post Office.

   This included investigating Sub Postmasters (SPMR) and Sub Postmaster's

   assistants. To the best of my memory, policies and practices did not change

   in any significant material way during that period excepting the introduction of

   taped recorded interviews and the increased use of computers to manage

   casework processes. Policies, procedures and practices were outlined in the

   POID manual subsequently translated into Group Policy, Procedures and

   Standards and in accordance with appropriate legislation including the Police

   and Criminal Evidence Act (1984) Codes of Practice and the Criminal

   Procedure and Investigations Act (1996) when the Act came into force.

                                                                                 WITNO8370100




The rationale behind the practice of bringing private prosecutions

5. Historically there has been a two century long plus precedent of Post

   Office/Royal Mail investigating its own crime and decades of bringing private

   prosecutions. The POID and its subsequent iterations such as Post Office

   Security and Investigation Services (POSIS) was a Home Office recognised

   law enforcement agency operating under all relevant criminal legislation. The

   Police had neither the resource, the knowledge nor the desire to investigate

   Post Office/Royal Mail internal crime. The obligation to carry out these

   activities in-house would have emanated from the considerations of public

   money, public property, public trust, the breach of that trust and deterrent. I

   cannot comment on POL's rationale post separation or after 2004. On

   occasions POL/RM may have requested Police assistance in an investigation.

   This may have been because there were additional external suspects linked

   or potential physical risk. This would not preclude POL/RM still leading the

   prosecution.

Policies governing the conduct of criminal investigations by the Security team and

the organisational structure


6. I have been asked to explain my role in the development, authorisation,

   management and/or assurance of several policies (listed by reference to

   documents that have been provided to me by the Inquiry) relating to the

   conduct of criminal investigations by the Security team. I have examined the

   documents provided to me. My responses are as follows.




                                   Page 4 of 23                                      Gp O
                                                                                   WITNO8370100
                                                                                  WITNO8370100




      a. POL00104771 (2002)- I have no particular recollection of the

         document but it's reasonable to assume that I would have been part of

         its assurance at that time.

      b. P0L00030578, P0L00104812 (2007) and P0L0031008 (2010) -

         would have been part of the assurance group for such a Group policy

         from my perspective in my role as Head of Investigation for Royal Mail.

      c. P0L00104806 (2007), P0L0031004 (2008), P0L0031003 (2009) and

         POL00030786 (2011) - I can't recall these documents specifically but it

         would be normal for me to have had awareness of such documents

         and if they were being reviewed, as Head of Investigation for Royal

         Mail.

      d. POL00026573 (2010), POL00104857(2010) - These documents were

         for RM Group Security team only.

      e. I have no knowledge of any of the remaining documents which




                                                                            all
         appear to be POL specific and all created after I had left POL in 2004.

7. When I arrived at POCL in 1996 I reported to a RSIM who in turn reported to

   the Head of Human Resources and subsequently the Head of Finance in one

   of 7 POCL Regions. To the best of my recollection the team consisted of 3

   Investigations Managers, 3 Counters Managers 2 ID, 3 Security Managers

   and some administration support staff_ A Post Office Security Executive sat in

   the POCL corporate centre setting physical and procedural Security policy. In

   1999 following the Shaping for Competitive Success project PON restructured

   and merged 7 regions into 3 territories with the Security and Investigation

   functions in those territories reporting to a Head of Security. In the East

   where I became TSM I inherited a similar but larger structure. I believe the

                                                                                    GRO
                                                                                   WITNO8370100
                                                                                  WITNO8370100




   West and North Territories were similarly structured. In 2002 following an

   internal re-organisation PON/POL moved to 3 teams with national specific

   responsibilities: - An Internal Crime and Investigation Team, a Physical and

   Procedural Security team and a third team that consisted predominantly of

   admin support and Burglary and Robbery liaison. I left for RM in 2004.

8. During my period in POCL/PON/POL the individual Investigator was

   responsible for the progression and conduct of an investigation held by them

   with input and advice as required from line managers and casework

   managers.

9. I have been asked about the role of the Financial Investigation Unit, and in

   what circumstances they would become involved in an investigation. I am

   unable to answer this question as the Financial Investigation Unit was

   introduced sometime after I had left POL in 2004

10. During my time in POL no other teams within POL were involved in criminal

   investigations and prosecutions.

11. During my time in POL, the legislation, policies, guidance and principles

   governing the conduct of investigations were predominantly the Police and

   Criminal Evidence Act (1984) Codes of Practice, the Criminal Procedure and

   Investigations Act (1996) and the POID manual subsequently translated into

   Group Policy, Procedures and Standards. Policies, procedures and standards

   were generally reviewed every three years and/or at any restructuring or if

   relevant legislation changed.

12. During my time in POL there was a Group Serious Complaints policy as

   guidance for dealing with complaints about members of the team in relation to

   their conduct in an investigation.

                                                                                          WITNO8370100
                                                                                     WITNO8370100




13. I have been asked about the nature of any supervision over criminal

   investigations by Security Managers. At no stage during my period at

   POOL/PON/POL from 1996 until I left in 2004 can I recall criminal

   investigations being carried out by people known as Security Managers.

   believe it was a generic job title introduced in POL in later years. During my

   time criminal investigations were carried out by Investigation Managers and

   Security Managers conducted physical and procedural security reviews and

   inspections. Any reference to Security Managers carrying out criminal

   investigations will I believe relate to a time after I had left. I do not recall any

   Security Managers supervising or overseeing investigations carried out by

   Investigation Managers.

14. During my time up until 2004 the Post Office's approach to suspected fraud

   was in accordance with the RM Group policy. Where it was identified, it was

   to investigate and apprehend and prosecute where appropriate those

   responsible.

15. During my time until 2004 there was no difference in the approach to

   investigate a Crown Office employee or a SPMR or a SPMR's assistant.

16. Post SCS, as a separate Business Unit, POL had increasingly sought to

   develop its own identity as a Business. From around 2008 POL was

   increasingly operating very separately and independently as a Business as it

   moved inevitably to separate. Although the Group Security Director may have

   still had some reserved powers POL Security operated without any Group

   oversight and it had developed its own policies, procedures and standards,

   together with the training of its employees. Whilst my name is included in at

   the top of some kind of process map as the Head of Investigation of RM, I had

                                                                                           GRO
                                                                                     WITNO8370100
                                                                                    WITNO8370100




   no knowledge or involvement in either POL00104900 or POLO104889_ I do

   not specifically recall document POL00105098 but I do recall having

   involvement in developing a memorandum of understanding where RM and

   POL were attempting to agree primacy in cross business crime investigations.

   E.g. Where an RM postman steals cash from behind the PO counter or a PO

   counter clerk steals mail from behind the counter.




How and when the Security team became involved in an investigation

17. From my knowledge prior to 2004, audits would be conducted either as part of

   the Audit team's own risk programme, if an office was closing or transferring

   or if it was requested as part of an Investigation inquiry.

18.1 have been asked to consider POL00084813 and explain in what

   circumstances an investigator would attend an audit of a branch and what

   their role was. I have no knowledge of this document as it relates to a date

   after I had left POL in 2004. During my time investigators played no role in the

   audit itself. If the investigator had requested the audit prior to an intended

   interview then I would have expected the investigator to attend the office

   before the audit had been completed. An exception would be if there was a

   possibility that evidence could be destroyed. If an unexpected deficit had been

   discovered by the audit team, then I would have expected the investigator to

   attend as soon as he/she could depending on other commitments/priorities.

19.1 am unaware of any specific instructions for auditors but during my time prior

   to my departure from POL I would have certainly expected the Investigation



                                                                                       -------

                                                                                   WITNO8370100
                                                                                  WITNO8370100




   team to have been contacted if an investigator had requested the audit and/or

   depending on the size of any discrepancy.

20. 1 have been asked to consider POL00104929 and POL00105226 and answer

   a number of questions in relation to decision-making following a shortfall

   being identified during a branch audit. I have no knowledge of these

   documents as they relate to a date after I had left POL in 2004. During my

   time in POCL/PON/POL the decision to pursue an investigation into potential

   criminality was made by the Investigation team and based upon the evidence

   available at the time. The Security team were not involved in debt recovery at

   all. To the best of my knowledge this was conducted within the Finance part of

   the business. The local contract managers were not involved in the decision

   or otherwise to conduct a criminal investigation. I do not know if they were

   associated with in any decisions involving debt recovery. I cannot recall

   specific triggers for raising cases during my time in POCL/PON/POL. Cases

   for inquiry could be raised from many sources: client complaints, customer

   complaints, staff information, random checks, audit activity. The volume and

   frequency of discrepancies were obviously factors together with the amounts

   involved. Cases were categorised as theft, false accounting etc. depending on

   the offences committed. Fraud Act offences came in after my time in POL.



Involvement of the Security team in the suspension process

21. 1 have been asked to consider POL00104809 (2005). I have no knowledge of

   or involvement in the document but it includes references to agents and is

   likely a legacy document. I have also been asked to consider POLOO105231

   (2012). This is a Royal Mail only document and does not relate to POL.

22. 1 have been asked about the Security team's role in suspension decisions

   when a shortfall was identified. During my time in POCL/PON/POL between

   1996 and 2004 an investigator would discuss the shortfall and the

   appropriateness of a suspension with the relevant Retail Network or Retail

   Line Manager. The Retail Line/Network Manager made the final decision to

   suspend.

23. During my time at POL up to 2004 there was no difference to the decision

   process for suspension involving a Crown employee or a SPMR or agent.

   The individuals who made the suspension decision in the business may have

   been in different operational lines of the business structure depending on the

   office being a Branch Office or a Sub office.

The process followed by Security team investigators when conducting a criminal

investigation following the identification of shortfall at an audit


24. During my time at POL between 1996 and 2004 Investigation Managers were

   expected to follow the evidence and conduct their investigations in

   accordance with all relevant legislation and the RM Group policy, procedures

   and standards.

25.1 have been asked to review a 14-page document, POL 00105223; that I have

   not seen before, was evidently written at least 9 years after I had left POL and

   to explain how it differs with processes that would have been in place during

   my time in POL. I don't have a specific document to compare it with but it

   appears to be a review of POL's casework process at the time. Broadly

   speaking it appears to follow a logical casework process that I'd have

   expected to see in my time: - covering the setting up of a file, source of

   information, other information or documents required, file construction,

                                    Page 10 of 23

                                                                                 WITNO8370100
                                                                               WITNO8370100




   reporting, association of necessary evidence (inc. tape transcripts,

   statements), obtaining process. The decision to set up a case appears to be

   at the discretion of a Team Manager rather than a casework manager. There

   are a number of forms that I do not recognise including FES and ECF. There

   are also a number of actions or information reference points in a number of

   areas that I am unaware of and/or that were not around during my time.

   These are Equifax, Stakeholder notification, statements from Fujitsu, call logs,

   full rota checks, PORA, Grapevine, Financial investigators, Credence. It also

   appears that external lawyers, Cartwright King, are advising on criminal

   cases.

Decisions about prosecution and criminal enforcement proceedings

26.1 have been asked to explain my role in the development, authorisation,

   management and/or assurance of any of the polices set out in several

   documents that I have been provided with by the Inquiry. I have examined the

   documents signposted in this question. My responses are as follows:

      a. POL00030659(1997)— I have no knowledge or recollection of this

            document.

      b. POL00030800 (2011), POL00031011 (2009)-I would expect to have

            been familiar with the 2 documents as Head of Investigation in RM but

            was not involved in their creation or management as they were owned

            by Legal Services.

      c. POL00031008 (2010) - It would be normal for me to have had sight

            and knowledge of such a document if it was being reviewed, as Head

            of Investigation for Royal Mail.

       d. POL00030598 (2011)-This document relates to Royal Mail only and not

          POL.

      e. I have no knowledge of any of the remaining documents which all

          appear to be POL specific and all created after I had left POL in 2004

          and one after I had retired.

27. I have been asked to describe the Post Office prosecution policy. During my

   time in POL up to my leaving in 2004 there was a Group Prosecution Policy.

   To the best of my recollection POL did not have a separate policy at this time.

   If there was any recorded distinct POL policy document it wouldn't have

   differed in essence from the Group policy.

28. Solicitor's Office Criminal Law (later Legal Services) advised on whether the

   case was suitable for prosecution and advised appropriate charges. During

   my time in POL the decision to prosecute was then made by the nominated

   business prosecution authority.

29. During my time in POL up to my departure in 2004 the local contract

   managers (Retail Network or Retail Line Managers) played no part in the

   decision or not to prosecute.

30. During my time in POL up to my departure in 2004 the advice to prosecute

   was made by Solicitor's Office Criminal Law in accordance with the Code for

   Crown Prosecutors.

31.The nominated business prosecution authority had the benefit of the Criminal

   Law advice on each individual case. They had also undertaken a short

   training course delivered by the Solicitors Office on the legal requirements,

   the prosecution process and their role within it as the business authority to

   prosecute.

   32. Legal advice was provided by internal solicitors in Criminal Law but if a case

      went to Crown Court, then external Counsel would also further advise.

   33. During my time in POL up to 2004 no different approach to investigating was

      applied to a case involving an audit shortage than any other case of an

      investigation.

   34.1 have been asked in what circumstances were steps to restrain a suspect's

      assets by criminal enforcement methods such as confiscation proceedings

      considered. During my time at POL steps to restrain a suspect's assets did

      not take place and such action was not possible.

   35. 1 have been asked who decided whether criminal enforcement proceedings

      should be pursued and what factors they considered when making such

      decisions. I cannot answer this question as no criminal enforcement

      proceedings took place during my time in POCL/PON/POL. Financial

      Investigators were introduced sometime after I had left in 2004.

Training, instructions and guidance to investigators within the Security team

   36.1 have been asked to consider POL00104805. If I recall correctly this

      document was a distance learning module developed in Royal Mail to

      supplement classroom training.

   37. During my time in POL between 1996 and 2004 training took the nature of a

      POSIS residential induction training course, was detailed in the POID manual

      and subsequently in Group Policy, procedures and standards that developed

      as we moved to ways of working involving computer systems. During my time

      up until around 2004 all POCL/PON/POL interviews were generally led by an

      Investigation Officer/Manager at FEB (CM1) Level.

   38. 1 cannot answer beyond 2004 as detailed above.

39. I have been provided with several documents by the Inquiry and asked if any

   of those documents were provided to investigators within the Security team.

      a. POL00105225 - I have no knowledge of this document which is a POL

          document apparently from 9 years after I left POL.

      b. All of the other documents listed and detailed were developed by Royal

          Mail, intended for a Royal Mail audience, and to the best of my

          recollection circulated to Royal Mail Investigators only and placed upon

          the RM Security intranet site. By this time POL Security was operating

          totally independently and had developed its own guidelines, processes

          and procedures. I cannot recall if POL had access to our intranet site. I

          do not know what documents POL provided to the POL Security team.

40. During my time in POL between 1996 and 2004 taking witness statements

   formed part of the POSIS residential induction training course, was detailed in

   the POID manual and subsequently the Group policy, procedures and

   standards and in the P.A.C.E. Act Codes of Practice.

41. 1 have been asked if POL00104827 and/or POL00104826 were provided to

   investigators within the Security team. Both of the documents listed and

   detailed were developed by Royal Mail, intended fora Royal Mail audience, to

   the best of my recollection circulated to Royal Mail Investigators only and

   placed upon the RM Security intranet site. I cannot recall if POL had access

   to the RM Security intranet site. I do not know what documents POL provided

   to the POL Security team.

42. During my time in POL between 1996 and 2004 conducting searches formed

   part of the POSIS residential induction training course, was detailed in the

   POID manual and subsequently the Group policy, procedures and standards

   and in the P.A.C.E. Act Codes of Practice.

43. I have been asked if POL00104828 and/or POL00104849 were provided to

   investigators within the Security team. Both of the documents listed and

   detailed were developed by Royal Mail , intended fora Royal Mail audience, to

   the best of my recollection circulated to Royal Mail Investigators only and

   placed upon the RM Security intranet site. I cannot recall if POL had access

   to the RM Security intranet site. I do not know what documents POL provided

   to the POL Security team.

44. During my time in POL between 1996 and 2004, conducting an investigation

   formed part of the POSIS residential induction training course, was detailed in

   the POID manual and subsequently the Group policy, procedures and

   standards.

45. During my time in POL between 1996 and 2004 obtaining evidence formed

   part of the POSIS residential induction training course, was detailed in the

   POID manual and subsequently the Group policy, procedures and standards.

46. 1 have been asked about what instructions, guidance and training were given

   to investigators about obtaining evidence held by Fujitsu in the course of an

   investigation. I cannot recall any guidance around Fujitsu during my time at

   POCL/PON/POL and I obviously can't comment after I left.

47. During my time in POL between 1996 and 2004 disclosure obligations formed

   part of the POSIS residential induction training course, was detailed in the

   POID manual and subsequently the Group Policy, procedures and standards

   with additional specific training post introduction of CPIA.

48. 1 have been asked if any of POL00104891, POL00104848 or POL00104893

   were provided to investigators within the Security team. All of the documents

   listed and detailed were developed by Royal Mail and intended for a Royal

   Mail audience and to the best of my recollection circulated to Royal Mail

   Investigators only. They would also have been placed on the RM Security

   intranet site. By this time POL Security was operating totally independently

   and had developed their own guidelines, processes and procedures. I do not

   know what documents POL provided to the POL Security team.

49. During my time in POL between 1996 and 2004 report writing formed part of

   the POSIS residential induction training course, was detailed in the POID

   manual and subsequently the Group Policy, procedures and standards.

50. 1 have been asked if either of POL00104881(2011) or POL00104879 (2011)

   were provided to the POL Security team. These documents are RM

   documents only and intended for a Royal Mail audience and circulated to

   Royal Mail Investigators only. I do not know what documents POL provided to

   the POL Security team.

Analysing Horizon data and requesting ARQ data from Fujitsu


51. 1 have been asked to consider POL00105223 and POL00105213 and to

   address, prior to the introduction of the tool "Credence" in 2009, what analysis

   was done by Security team investigators of Horizon data when a SPM/ SPMs'

   assistant/ Crown Office Employee attributed a shortfall to problems with

   Horizon. I am unable to answer this question as I have no knowledge of the

   documents or the tools identified as they relate to dates after I had left POL in

  2004. During my time in POCL/PON/POL I cannot recall any cases where

   SPMRs/SPMRs assistants or Crown Office employees attributed a shortfall to

   problems with Horizon.

52. 1 have been asked to explain the process for requesting Horizon data from

   Fujitsu. During the period from Horizon's introduction until I left in 2004,

   cannot recall any specific process for obtaining data but I do recall that

   requests for data printouts were only allowed to be very limited due to contract

   restrictions, making them difficult to obtain if required and therefore fairly rare.

53. 1 have been asked to consider POL00105222 and answer if there was a

   formalised process for requesting ARQ data from Fujitsu prior to publication of

   this document (September 2013). I am unable to answer this question as I

   have no knowledge of this document or any process relating as it refers to a

   date after I had left POL in 2004

54. 1 have been asked about ARQ logs and their use. I do not know what ARQ

   logs are or for what they were/are used.

55. I have been asked whose decision it was whether ARQ data was requested

   from Fujitsu in a given case. I cannot answer this question for the reason

   explained above

56. I have been asked where a shortfall had been identified and the SPM/

   assistant/ Crown Office employee was attributing it to problems with Horizon

   but did not have corroborating evidence of material problems with Horizon, if

   ARQ data was requested from Fujitsu as a matter of course. I cannot answer

   this question for the reason explained above.

57. I have been asked if ARQ data was provided to a SPM as a matter of course

   when it was obtained from Fujitsu. I cannot answer this question for the

   reason explained above.

Cases against SPMs


  58. 1 have been asked about my recollections of the criminal cases in respect of

     24 named individuals. I have no recollection of any of these cases or names

     supplied. I have been asked to examine documents relating to 2 cases. Both

     would appear to have taken place after I had left POL and my name

     appearing in a box on a casework tick-list would seem to be a templated

     document that had not been amended after my departure.

  59. I have been asked if there are any prosecutions which I had a role as

     investigator which I consider are relevant to the matters being investigated by

     the public inquiry. None at all.

  60. 1 have been asked, looking back, if I have any concerns about any criminal

     cases in which I was involved. To the best of my recollection, I did not

     personally conduct any investigations into counters crime after 1998 and

     therefore I don't believe any of my cases would have involved Horizon. I have

     absolutely no concerns about any of the criminal cases that I conducted.

  The Security team's role in relation to debt recovery

  61. 1 had no role in or knowledge of debt recovery during my time in POL.

  Knowledge of bugs, errors, and defects in the Horizon system

  62. I had no personal concerns nor awareness of any concerns around the

     robustness of the Horizon system or problems with it. And therefore, I have

     none to report. I have been asked to consider POL00086845 and

     POL00088867 and to address whether the suggestion that system faults with

      Horizon were "very rare" correspond with my understanding of the position in

      2003. Yes, it would correspond to my opinion, as I was unaware of any faults.

   Other matters


   63. 1 have nothing to add.




I believe this statement to be true.
