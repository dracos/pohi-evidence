Dear Sirs

REGINA ~v- CARL ADRIAN PAGE
STAFFORD CROWN COURT - TRIAL - 4 JANUARY 2005

I write concerning unused material held by H M Customs & Excise in Birmingham which relates to

Although the material held by Customs & Excise had previously been inspected by both the writer
and the Head of Criminal Law on behalf of this office, in the light of earlier correspondence I asked
Counsel to review all the material held by H M Customs & Excise Birmingham Office.

I have very much in mind the earlier correspondence, and the contents of your client’s Defence
Statement dated 3° August, and in particular paragraph 6. However, following his inspection, it
remains the view of the Prosecution that none of this material falls for disclosure. However, in the
interests of transparency, I wish to advise you of the following, which is largely by way of
amplification of the information contained in my letter of 24" September:

(a) The Customs & Excise surveillance operation centred on

and, as previously
stated, commenced on 10" December 2002.

(b) Surveillance was carried out at varying times on 10", 11", 12", 13", 16", 17", 19", 20" and
30" December 2003, and on 2”, 8", 11", 12" and 13” January 2003.

was observed at Bureau de Change outlets on 10", 13”, 17", 28" and 30”
December and on 2™ and 13" January 2003. All were at Thomas Cook in New Street,
Birmingham, with the exception of 2” January 2003 which was at HSBC, Waterloo Street,
Birmingham.

(d) The first and only surveillance of Customs & Excise which showed
Rugeley Post Office was that on 13" January 2003, the date of arrest.

As indicated in my letter of 24" September, Mr Page was at no stage a target of either Customs &
Excise investigation, although his identity as the Sub Postmaster at Rugeley was known as from 12”
December 2002. With reference to the paragraph numbered (5) on page 2 of your letter of 20"
September, the only knowledge which Customs & Excise had of Mr P: prior to his arrest was his

identity as the Subpostmaster at Rugeley. I have to repeat that I GRO___} was the target of an

investigation into suspected money-laundering, and that there is no information save for the above
which relates to your client.

I consider that I should make the following further observations at this stage in the light of your
continuing requests concerning Customs & Excise involvement:

(a) Many hours have been spent by the Investigation Manager, two lawyers from this office and
Counsel in carefully considering your correspondence and all the documents held both in
London and Birmingham by Customs & Excise;

(b) Your expressed concerns relating to the knowledge of Customs & Excise in relation to your
client have been looked at in the light of your correspondence and your client’s Defence
Statement; *

(c) As the Defence Statement correctly points out, it is clear on the papers that there was
surveillance-by Customs & Excise, but there has never been any question of your client being
a target of that surveillance;

(d) There is no basis for suggesting in relation to your client that “the investigations of Customs
& Excise into this matter will provide vital information as to his conduct.” The disclosure
which has been given makes it quite clear that his conduct was not under investigation.

(e) It is also incorrect to assert that “on the face of the papers, the Prosecution authorities and in
particular Customs & Excise were aware of potential criminal activities and allowed them to
continue.” The references to Boyne and other cases bear absolutely no relation to an
investigation of this kind.

This office is doing its level best to respond to detailed and extensive requests for disclosure in this
case. We will continue to do so. However, a stage must come, in the interests of all concerned,
when you either accept that we are properly complying with our disclosure obligations or you take
steps in relation to the third party material which we have carefully considered. We are alive to your
concerns, but hope that you will be prepared to accept that we are dding our best to assist you
whilst not going far beyond the bounds of our obligations.

d Yours faithfully

Debbie Helszajn
