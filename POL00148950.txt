Subject: FW: CK Draft Instructions to Expert
Attachment: INSTRUCTIONS TO EXPERT (Draft).doc

Andrew and Jessica

Following the round table meeting with the experts last month, Jessica indicated that she wanted all individuals
engaged on the expert report process (whether employed by POL or ICON) to sign individual confidentiality
agreement.

At the present time there is confidentiality agreement in force, but I think it has been signed on behalf ICON.
Accordingly I would be grateful if you could review the position with regards to the confidentiality agreement and
draft such individual agreements as are necessary to fully protect POLs interests.

During the meeting itself a way forward was agreed which would entail experts receiving POL counter training
towards end of September at old street and high level lectures at fujitsu offices in October .It is therefore essential
that these matters are dealt with as soon as possible.

CK have drafted instructions and protocol for the request and provision of information, discussed during the round
table meeting. However they have not send it to the experts and will not do so until the content has been approved
and they have been given OK to go forward or OK to press send.

Can you indicate whether you are happy with these draft instructions. If you have any comments and proposals let
others on CC list know so they may be considered by everyone.

Given there are numerous people CC into the e mail . I should make it clear that under no circumstances should this
email nor the draft instructions and protocol be send to or shared with fujitsu.

Regards

Jarnail.
