4. Introduction

This document covers the implementation of HNG-X Release 2 (R2).
This release is the first major release to deliver new and changed
functionality to the Horizon Online Platform currently being deployed in
HNG-X Release 1 (R1).

5. Purpose

Purpose of this document is to provide an overview of implementation
plans and migration strategy to ensure successful delivery of all projects
into the live environment.

6. Background

Throughout the development and testing of the Horizon Online platform
currently being deployed to the counters there has been a hold on
Horizon development projects. As the first release to deliver new or
changed functionality R2 has a large number of projects that are looking
to be deployed in this first window of opportunity. Though many of them
themselves are not large projects the volume of projects makes this a
large and complex release in terms of testing and implementation.

The R1 rollout has been problematic and is not currently forecasting to
complete until mid September. To prevent delays to the R2 deployment,
the release has been re-configured to enable data centre migration to
take place while the branch estate is on a mixed environment, i.e. some
branches still on the Horizon baseline and others having been upgraded
to Horizon Online.

While the data centre migration for R2 can occur on a mixed estate,
counter code rollout must still follow the rollout of R1, lagging by 1 week
to allow bedding in before additional change is introduced to the
branches.

Therefore the product implementations for R2 can be categorised into
the following groups:
1. Enlivened by Data Centre Migration — 1% August 2010 — No
counter code delivery is required for these changes
2. Enlivened by the delivery of the R2 code and/or reference
data — 15" August to 30 September — these products will go live
as the individual branches receive the R2 code and or reference
data. Roll out beginning on 15" August.

Draft 0.3 Page 7

FUJ00097480
FUJ00097480

IT Directorate PSO Process Implementation Plan Document Template

3. Enlivened as a ‘Big Bang’ launch — 12" October — these
products require the R2 code to be in all branches across the
network and will be ‘switched on’ overnight on the 11" October via
enablement reference data.

4. PING Phased Deployment - the PING products will be
introduced across the network in pre-defined groups of branches,
aligned to the product type and branch trading periods, enabled by
the delivery of Reference Data  and__ Transaction
Acknowledgements (TAs). This will occur from the 12" October
until approximately the end of November.

7. Objectives

7.1 Critical Release Dates

The following milestones are the target dates for the R2 implementation:

Data centre migration completed by the 1% August

Model Office 9" — 12° August

Small scale pilots (product specific) 16"" — 29'" August

Rollout stage 1 (100 branches ) - 15" August

Rollout stage 2 (full scale) — 22"? August

Full rollout to complete 30" September

‘Big Bang’ product launches — 12'" October

PING phased enlivenment — 12" October to the end of November

7.2 Critical Project Dates

The following milestones are the contractual milestone dates for
individual projects that were they exist and are within the R2 timescales:

e VocaLink LIS 5-2008-1 Standard — 31/10/10 — this is scheduled to
go live post data centre migration, 04/08/10.

8.2 Out of Scope

¢ The completion of the PCI 2-Factor Authentification Feasibility
Study — This is a feasibility study only, and although targeted for
completion in R2 will not deliver any development of new
functionality within the R2 timescales.

¢ Development and deployment of the AEI Near Real Time and
POCa Card Fulfilment counter elements for these products, and
the Removal of Track 2 data for A&L, which will be delivered in
release 2.10.03.

¢ All projects that will be delivered in releases 3, 4 and future
releases.

e Camelot Cheque Reconciliation. Although this has been
developed within R2 it will be implemented later in the year subject
to further BAU APOP testing.

e Launch of the MoneyGram Loyalty Card Scheme. Though
originally planned for release within the R2_ timescales,
MoneyGram have requested that this be postponed until a later
date, to be confirmed. It will however be live in the data centre
and be proved through Model Office, though not enabled in any
other live branches at this time.

9. Software Release Deployment

The release of the R2 software (code) to the estate will be taken
forward in a phased approach to assess performance in 100
branches before its distribution is scaled up to significant volumes.
Full rollout could be achieved within 2 weeks of full rollout but will be
subject to the completion of the R71 rollout.

Implementation Plan Document Template

Note:

Where a branch is migrating from Horizon to Horizon

Online within the R2 rollout period the branch will receive the
R2 code the day after the upgrade to Horizon Online. At the time
of the R2 rollout being ramped up to significant volumes the
deployment of R1 should be coming to an end and therefore <1500
branches may be affected by this.

The software release development will be according to the following
schedule, subject to the Release Authorisation Board decision points

(section 9):
Date Stage
31/07/10- Data Centre migration
01/08/10
08/08/10 Code released to Model Office
15/08/10 Code release to 100 branches (including pilot
branches)
22/08/10 Code release begins at full capacity
30/09/10 Code in all branches (including _ tail

management)

10. Implementation of the Release Products

10.1 Data Centre Only Changes

The following changes are back end system changes and are live on

completion of the data centre upgrade, 1‘t August.

They require no

counter code delivery, with the exception of VocaLink response code
085 handling and, and have no visible effect in branch.

10.1.1 Additional APOP Host Postal Orders Reports

This introduces additional APOP Host Postal Order reports which
will become available within the APOP reporting system as of
01/08/10.

10.1.2 VocaLink LIS 5-2008-1 Standard

The implementation of the VocaLink LIS 5-2008-1 Standard will
implement in three distinct phases.

Phase 1 — Data Centre Migration

Draft 0.3,

Page 10

FUJ00097480
FUJ00097480

IT Directorate PSO Process Implementation Plan Document Template

On Data Centre migration the functionality to enable the LIS 5-
2008-1 Standard will become live. However the switch to the new
interface will not be made at this time to reduce the number of
activities occurring on the data centre weekend and de-risk the
switchover.

Phase 2 —Cutover

Cutover to the new interface will occur at 1am on the 4" August.
At this time the switch to the new interface will be instigated by
VocaLink to map to the new service and correspondingly by
Fujitsu Services to enliven the new interface. At this time an open
bridge call will be maintained to coordinate activities.

Currently VocaLink operate a mapping for response code 085 ‘No
reason to decline’ which cannot currently be handled by counters
at either the Horizon or Horizon Online R1 baselines. This
mapping will be migrated from VocaLink into the Fujitsu data
centre at the same time as the interface is switched over. There is
no visible change in branches.

Phase 3 — R2 Counter Code Roll Out Complete

On completion of the R2 counter code roll out the counters will all
be able to correctly handle response code 085 and the mapping
workaround in the data centre will be removed. There is no visible
change at the counters when this occurs.

Date Implementation Activity

01/08/10 Data Centre migration — ability to cutover to the
interface is delivered

04/08/10 Cutover

e VocaLink LIS 5-2008-1 Standard live
e¢ Mapping of RC085 enlivened in the Fujitsu Data

Centre
e Mapping of RC085 disabled in the VocaLink
domain
30/09/10 R2 code roll out complete — counters now able to
handle response code 085 correctly
01/10/10 Mapping of Response Code 085 disabled in the FS
domain

10.1.3 Streamline Rectifications —- Phase 1

Draft 0.3, Page 11

FUJ00097480
FUJ00097480

IT Directorate PSO Process Implementation Plan Document Template

On Data Centre migration the following fixes will be applied to
Streamline transactions, and as they have no counter code
dependencies will be live from this point, 01/08/10:
e Population of card issue number in settlement file —
currently not populated

e Changes to settlement file to meet the latest PCI
standards

10.2 Enlivened by the Delivery of the R2 Code and/or Reference Data

The following products will become live in each branch as and when it
receives the R2 code:

e PAF Lite

¢ Streamline (Phase 2)

¢ Card Refferals

Note: As these product go live with receipt of the R2 code, they will all
be live in the Model Office from 09/08/10 and will also go live in the
branches participating in pilots for PING Stock Adjustments) and
Improved Validation of Banking Transactions from the 16 August
(code delivered overnight on the 15" August).

The following products will be enabled through reference data:

e¢ MoneyGram Agent Lookup — This is independent of the R2 code
release and will be enlivened on 06/09/10.

e AP-ADC Date Calculation (Travel Insurance) — This is dependant
on the branches having received the R2 code and reference data
which will be released for enablement on the 23/08/10. Therefore
the product will not be enabled in the initial 100 branches that
receive the code but will go live in these branches on the 23/08/10
and in all other branches on receipt of the R2 code.

10.2.1 AP-ADC Date Calculation (Travel Insurance)

The new AP-ADC Date Diff data type that this project introduces
will be incorporated into the Travel Insurance sales transaction
and distributed to all travel insurance sales branches, c.8500.

The introduction of the product is controlled via reference data
which will be released to the c.8500 branches after model office.

Draft 0.3, Page 12

branches as they receive the R2 code

30/09/10 R2 code roll out complete — all branches live

10.2.2 Card Referrals
Card Referrals is a core product and will be enlivened in each
branch on receipt of the R2 code. As it is not possible to live
prove this product, i.e. it would be very difficult to predict or
generate a referral for a particular live card transaction, there is no
requirement for a soft launch or pilot.

Date Implementation Activity

09/08/10 Enlivened for Model Office (on receipt of R2 code) —
no live proving requirement

10.2.3 PAF Lite

The PAF Lite product will be delivered through a combination of
the reference data build for the PAF Lite product and switching
script that will recognise the code base individual offices are on
e.g. R1, R1.29, R2. Both the build and the switching script will be
released on Data Centre migration and as a result when an office

10.2.4 Streamline Rectifications - Phase 2
The following fixes require R2 counter code to be delivered before
they are live in individual branches. There is no Model Office live
proving or pilot requirements for these changes.
¢ Online check for Maestro cards failing validity checks —
currently rejected offline

e Display of referral response message — currently referred
transactions declined without displaying a message

e Cardholder receipt produced if PIN verified transaction
declined — currently no cardholder receipt produced

10.2. MoneyGram Agent Lookup

Moneygram Agent lookup has been developed such that it can be
enlivened on any of the existing Horizon or Horizon Online
baselines and as such is not dependant on the delivery of the R2
code. It can therefore be delivered to the network at any time after
data centre. To enlivenment date, controlled through reference
data delivery will be 6" September.

05/08/10 Reference Data released to Model Office
09/08/10 Enlivened for Model Office Live Proving
03/09/10 Reference Data released to the full estate
06/09/10 Enlivened in all branches

Draft 0.3,

10.3 Enlivened as a ‘Big Bang’ Launch

The following products are required to be enabled across the entire
network on the same day for either operational or training purposes.

They
them

are controlled by reference data enablement products to ‘switch’
on, and are dependant on the R2 code having been delivered to

all branches in the network (to complete by 30/09/10).

These products will all go live on the 12" October.

10.3.

1 Stock Adjustments

The Stock Adjustments product will be enabled via a reference
data soft launch product to support the need for Model Office live
proving and a controlled pilot in 20 branches. Once a successful
pilot has been confirmed reference data will be delivered to the
estate to enable enlivenment of the product in a big bang
approach across the network.

Prior to Model Office live proving there is a requirement to first test
the new Logica/FS Reference Data System (RDS) interface for
providing reference data for stock items, and subsequently provide
the full item list across this interface. This will occur in the week
between Data Centre migration and Model Office live proving.

10.4 PING Phased Deployment

PING will be implemented in a number of phases, aligned to product
type and branch trading periods. This is a relatively complex
deployment and will not be started until the R2 code deployment has
been completed.

Draft 0.3, Page 17

FUJ00097480
FUJ00097480

IT Directorate PSO Process Implementation Plan Document Template

10.41 R2- Interfacing Client Data into POL Systems (PING)

The PING product will be implemented through a cycle of activities
that will be replicated for a branch pilot and a_ staged
implementation phase aligned to branch trading periods. The
products for which PING will be implemented in R2 are,
Paystation, Post & Go and Camelot. The cycle is as follows:

e Delivery of non-core reference data to disable the
existing transactions (post-dated to enlivenment date).

e Delivery of enablement reference data for the new
transactions (post-dated to enlivenment date).

e Master Data (Credence) updated to enable transaction
acknowledgements to be issued to the selected
branches.

¢ R2 code delivery — menu items will become active but
benign until a transaction acknowledgement file is
received at the branch.

e¢ Enlivenment through the delivery of transaction
acknowledgement files.

Model Office live proving will only be possible for the Paystation
and Post & Go products as the Model Office does not have a
Camelot terminal. However this will be sufficient to prove the
functionality in the live environment prior to pilot activities, ‘test’
transaction acknowledgement files will be used in the model office.

Pilot activities will follow the same pattern as the stage rollout of
the full functionality and align to branches grouped by product and
branch trading periods. Thirty Pilot branches will be selected from
Crown offices that have already migrated to R1.

The Implementation Groups are as follows -

15.1 Model Office

15.11 Data Centre Migration
Model Office proving will commence at 3:30 am on 01/08/10. At
this point the Model Office will still be on the R1 Horizon Online
baseline and this proving activity will focus on Regression Testing
i.e. performing as many transactions as possible to ensure that
the introduction of the R2 Data Centre has not caused any
unforeseen problems.

Detailed transaction plan to be worked up outside of this
document.

15.1.2 Live Proving

The Model Office will be upgraded to the R2 baseline on 09/08/12,
for any specific reference data activities to enable individual
products see section 10 of this document.

Live proving will operate between 09/08/10 and 11/08/10,
inclusive. The first activity within Model Office will be to accept the
R2 code and then back the code out, reverting to the R1 Baseline
to prove the functionality to regress the counters if required. Live
proving of the individual transactions will then commence.

Live proving activities will cover both counter stability testing and
transactional tests derided from those developed for SV&I testing
and held in Quality Centre.
