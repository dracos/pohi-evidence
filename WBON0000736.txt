No problem. I would like to turn these spot review around much more quickly, so the more help the better.

Rodric, Simon

Would you mind if I brought Rosie Gaisford to our meeting today? Rosie is an NQ who recently joined our litigation
team from CMS. I'd like Rosie to pick up the junior level work on this project and I thought it would be helpful for her to
meet the team.

Kind regards
Andy
