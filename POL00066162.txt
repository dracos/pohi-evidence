Dear Sir
REGINA v PETER ANTHONY HOLMES

NEWCASTLE CROWN COURT
MENTION - W/L WIC 14™ SEPTEMBER 2009

Please find enclosed a copy of a letter that I have forwarded to the Defence.

Instructing Solicitors view is that a charge of theft is quite proper in this case. Should
the Defence maintain their stance then it may be that the Financial Investigator would
be in a position to obtain further financial information regarding the Defendant's
account. If this is the case then consideration could then be given to whether or not it
is necessary to instruct an Accountant.

Counsel is asked to consider whether the addition of a charge under the Fraud Act
would be appropriate in this case.

Yours faithfully

J A McFarlane
Principal Lawyer
Criminal Law Division
