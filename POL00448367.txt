Hi Nick

Hope all is well, please see below emails exchanged between myself and Martin regarding the new
ATM contracts which I briefly mentioned to you last week.

lam extremely disappointed that I have not had a response for two weeks to my most recent email,
can you look into this please.

Please give me a call if needed.

Hi Martin

Hope all is well and thank you for your email, the reason for seeking further clarity is for my own personal information
in order to understand the level at which we consult the NFSP, hence why I am asking for what proposals we made
and what we agreed on and how.

I am trying to understand how, we as a business, consult and engage with the Post Master population so that we can
get balanced feedback from all types of branches. Hence why the NFSP feedback is important because a large number
of PMs do not feel that the NFSP represents them. We need to engage with Post Masters to fully understand their
concerns and ideas if we are to move the business forward together.

POL00448367
POL00448367

As per the GLO judgement our relationship and funding with the NFSP was criticized and you may be aware many
Postmasters’ are disconnected with the NFSP as they feel they do not hold us as an organisation to account.

As per your previous email, as a business we are providing a fair competitive deal according to the current market
offerings however, I do not want Postmasters’ feeling like what ever we proposed was a done deal and there was no
negotiations from the NFSP as this is the perception about the organisation for many.

All I ask is for how did we go through the iterations with Callum and who were the other PMs and what was our initial
offer and how did we modify this?

The reason for asking about the ATM product is because it is a recent revised product offering and I have also asked
the same about MDA 2, also the question’s I have asked have been raised by PMs to me and are based on the packs
we sent out which we state all this was done.

My interest is for our business as a whole from the front line to the top and we must as a collective become more
transparent as per the GLO judgement and ensure all PMs are onboard with our decisions. As to any changes to our
proposition how we communicate these changes is crucial, and before I can understand our communication channels I
need to understand the process and discussions behind he decisions.

Hi Saf

I wonder if you could let me know more about why you seek further information to help me answer it in context
please.

We went though several iterations with key members (including Calum and other PMs who do have ATMs), and
listened, took their advice and modified our offer.

We do that with almost every enhancement across all products, so am keen to understand why this particular one has
your interest rather than a more general inquiry into ‘how involved are NFSP in helping guide feedback on REM
opportunities?’

Thanks

Martin

Hi Martin

Thank you for the information provided, this was very helpful in understanding how our deal
compares to IAD’s.

However, I would still like to know about the second part of my email as this was communicated
with PM’s in the ATM pack’s sent out:

“Regarding the NFSP also can you provide me with more detailed information on some of the

remuneration models we proposed and whom in the organisation we consulted.”

Saf

With apologies this has taken a few days longer than planned, please find enclosed a comparison of the different
types of ATM contract IADs are offering. The IAD list is based on an actual contract offer (not just market info) for
which we can’t reveal the source, so would appreciate the appropriate discretion.

We understand that Cashzone are approaching PM’s with a ‘1p more than POL’ offer on transaction REM. We are
preparing a guide to PMs to say ‘dont be dazzled by the 1p uplift and miss the £100’s of extra costs!’

For instance, IADS will not pay Business Rates, POL will. [ADs will not promise to update the machine (leaving the old
BOI one in place — even though BO! have refused to sell them so far). So there are a number of major pitfalls which - if
someone is tempted — they may miss.

Best

Martin
