BA/POCL AUTOMATION PROJECT: LETTER FROM FUJITSU TO THE BRITISH
AMBASSADOR IN TOKYO

1. This note confirms the message I asked Natasha to pass to you earlier this morning.

2. For legal reasons, should we come to litigation with ICL, we are advised we cannot
let the Fujitsu letter lie on the table unchallenged. We suggest that we send a letter of
robuttal, for the British Ambassador to forward to Fujitsu out of courtesy. ie. preserving the
Ambassador’s detachment.

3. We will be drafting something to put around early tomorrow.
