1 Purpose

This document provides a report about investigations into the Integrity of the Horizon System provided
by Fujitsu to Post Office Ltd.

It has been produced at the request of Jarnail Singh of Post Office Ltd

There are two separate reports that have been previously produced covering the integrity of Horizon

cases.

development, the Business scope and Architecture diagrams for both the original Horizon System and
the current Horizon Online system.

in various related cases that Post Office Ltd have asked me to consider.

2 The Horizon System

2.1 Timeline

Fujitsu were originally awarded a contract in 1996 to provide a Horizon System to Post Office Ltd. The
following provides some key dates and functional changes:

* Horizon Pilot 1996

e Horizon Rollout 1999 — 2002
e Network Banking 2003

« EMV 2004

* Cash Account removed 2005
e Data Centre Migration 2009
e HNG-X Rollout 2010

Horizon Online (or HNG-X) was a major re-implementation of Horizon. It was a complete re-
implementation of the business functionality at the counter and utilised a central Database to hold details
of all transactions rather than the MessageStore used by the original Horizon system.

All Post Office Branches migrated from the original Horizon to Horizon Online between January and
September 2010. Historical transactions were made visible in the new system as part of the migration
process.

2.2 Business Scope
The Business scope of Horizon is:
e Point Of Sale Application
e Transaction Recording
o All such transactions are Audited
e Posting Summary Transactions to POL SAP (Post Office Ltd's back end accounting system)

« Posting Detailed Transactions to Credence (Post Office Ltd’s back end Management Information
system)

e Posting Remuneration Data to HR-SAP (Royal Mail Group’s back end Payroll system)

* Delivering Client Data to Post Office Ltd’s Clients (ie 3% parties that Post Office Ltd acts as an
agent for such as Local Authorities and Utility companies etc)

2.3 Architecture Diagrams
DO Titeed 6 add Some words of description Wiese diagrams?

3 Horizon Integrity

This is described in the separate integrity documents [ARC/GEN/REP/0004] and [Horizon Online Data
Integrity].

| have been involved personally in a number of challenges to the integrity of the original Horizon system
and produced Witness Statements for a number of cases where the Integrity has been challenged. | am
not aware of any cases where the Integrity of Horizon Online has yet been successfully challenged in
court.

The main challenges in boththe-West -Byfleet-and-Rinkfield the cases in which | have been
involved were presented as “Hypothetical issues” and my previous Witness Statements inthe-West-
Gyllest Holst Va. tal Hoy went through each of these hypotheses and showed that

there was no specific evidence for any of them in the data presented.

In summary | would conclude by saying that | fully believe that Horizon will accurately record all data
that is submitted to it and correctly account for it. However it cannot compensate for any data that is
incorrectly input into it as a result of human error, lack of training or fraud (and nor can any other
system).
