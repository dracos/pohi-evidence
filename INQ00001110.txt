paragraph 651, the Court of Appeal, in
Hamilton -- it's their paragraphs 113 and 147 —
said that it was ‘irrational and unjust’ for the

Post Office to have required that they ‘had the
money short of theft’ and the Court of Appeal
observed that:

[The Post Office's] conduct gives a firm
impression that the condition of repayment in
return for [the Post Office] dropping the charge
of theft placed undue pressure on Mrs Hamilton.
It gives the impression that {the Post Office]
was using the prosecution to enforce repayment.”

Did you find any material that undermined
the impression that the Court of Appeal formed?
No, and the words that her plea would be
accepted on her recognition that she had the
money short of theft were words from the lawyer
in the Criminal Law Department at the Post
Office and, again ~ and that was a discussion
in advance of Mrs Hamilton pleading to false
accounting.

‘And so, on the one hand, you have

the acceptance of false accounting, rather than
theft, and yet it being a condition of that that

the individual in the criminal proceedings be
made liable for paying back money that you are
accepting they have not taken.

There may be a separate, civil discussion as
to whether, under the postmaster's contract they
were required to make good a loss that they had
not caused but this is in the criminal
proceedings, making it a condition or pursuing
criminal mechanisms in order to get money that
you are accepting they have not taken.

Thank you. Can we turn to topic 10 ~ that can
‘come down, thank you. The last topic is expert
evidence

Can we start by way of a recap of your
previous evidence to the Inquiry. You said that
a prosecutor intending to rely on expert
evidence in criminal proceedings was, during the
relevant period, subject to the following
obligations -- and this is just by way of brief
recap to the questions I am going to ask -- to
satisfy themselves that the expert had been
appropriately instructed, including by the

provision of a detailed letter of instructions
26

instructing an expert, the lawyers instructing

an expert, to communicate those duties to the
expert to make sure the expert understood them,
evolved over the period of the Inquiry but, from
quite early in the period, it was again clear

that that was what was required of them.

Yes. In the five case studies in which the Post
Office obtained evidence from Mr Gareth
Jenkins -- that’s Thomas, Misra, Allen, Sefton
and Nield and Ishaq ~

Yes.

~ forgive the use of the surnames -- did you
identify any document or evidence that
demonstrates that Post Office prosecutors or,
later, those acting on their behalf from
Cartwright King, informed or instructed

Mr Jenkins about the duties of an expert?

No.

Did you see any evidence that such prosecutors
were themselves cognisant of the existence of
any of these duties?

No.

Did you see any evidence that they complied with
any of these obligations in their dealings with

Mr Jenkins?

A. Yes, I hope so.

Q. Thank you very much. Can we turn to Mr Thomas’
case next, please.

SIR WYN WILLIAMS: Before you do, Mr Beer, can
I just understand what went on in Mrs Adedayo's.
case. Her conviction was quashed by Southwark
Crown Court; that's correct, isn't it?

A. Yes.

SIR WYN WILLIAMS: So this is purely technical but
where you write that she pleaded guilty at the
Crown Court, I don't think can be right, can it?
Presumably what happened, she pleaded guilty at
the Magistrates Court but was then committed for
sentence?

A. That must be right, yes, sir.

SIR WYN WILLIAMS: That's just a mere technicality.

But what's of more interest in her case is
that there's no real rationale, is there, in how
her conviction was quashed or why it was
quashed, because we haven't got a formal

judgment of the Southwark Crown Court; is that
53

described to me and the judge didn't determine
the issue between them?
A. No, that's right, sir
SIR WYN WILLIAMS: So am I right in thinking that
the only objective -- by which I mean
independent of Mrs Adedayo or the Post Office ~
assessment is that which we currently have, is
that which is contained in the reference by the
Criminal Review Commission?
A. Yes.
SIR WYN WILLIAMS: Yes, fine. Thank you.
Sorry, Mr Beer, I wanted to be clear in my
mind about this case.
MR BEER: Yes, thank you.
I think the document that you saw was
a transcript of the hearing at Southwark Crown
Court in front of Her Honour Judge Taylor —
A. Yes.
Q. ~of 14 May 2021. That ends ~ the hearing
starts at 10.47. Do you want to just have
a look at it? I'm not sure we're going to be
able to display this.
I think it's Volume 1 of the Rule 10
material at tab D32.

‘A. Thank you very much. Yes, thank you.

correct?

A. We have a transcript of the hearing at which it
was indicated by counsel acting for the Post
Office that, although they didn't accept the
reasons that had been advanced on Mrs Adedayo's
behalf for why her conviction should be quashed
they nevertheless considered that it would be
contrary to the public interest to seek to
uphold her conviction and so they didn't oppose
her appeal.

There was no judgment given, and I'l be
corrected if I'm wrong about it, no judgment
given by the Recorder of Westminster who
presided over that hearing, separate from that,
but -- and so the transcript is less than
helpful as to exactly why it came about that
Mrs Adedayo’s conviction was quashed.

Certainly the Post Office made clear they
didn't accept a good deal of what Mrs Adedayo's
case, as considered by the Criminal Cases Review
Commission, had been.

SIR WYN WILLIAMS: So, in effect, at court, there
was an issue which was unresolved by the judge.
Mrs Adedayo's case was presented in a particular

way, the Post Office said what you've just
54

Q. Is that the relevant transcript?

Itis, yes.

Q. The hearing starts, we can see on page 2, at
10.47. Ms Carey, I think that's Jacqueline
Carey, appears on behalf of the prosecution, and
speaks over pages 2, 3 and 4, and then
Mr Moloney, who appeared for both appellants,
says a few words, ten words or so.

>

A. Yes, he was largely inaudible, apparently.

Q._ Yes, which is no doubt due to the recording,
rather than Mr Moloney.

A. Sure.

Q. There's then a discussion or something that Her
Honour Judge Taylor said, which concerns
jurisdiction,

A. Yes, because Mrs Adedayo had pleaded guilty in
the ~ and so you're entirely right, she pleaded
guilty in the Medway Magistrates Court to the
offences and was then sent to the Crown Court,
to Maidstone Crown Court for sentence. So,
procedurally, her guilty pleas had to be set
aside before her conviction could be quashed and
0 that's the discussion at the end

Q. Then the hearing concludes with this, Judge

Taylor saying

A. Yes.

Q._ Would you agree — you'll see the reference to
the three ARQs in the first line of the cut-in

that it was the Post Office which had selected
the three specific time periods for the

A. Yes.

Q._ Would you agree that this instruction to
Mr Jenkins didn't constitute or indeed come
close to being a proper instruction to
an expert?

A. Yes.

Q._ Instead, it's a request coming from the Post
Office to the Fujitsu Litigation Support Team

MR BEER: Sir, good moming. Can you continue to

SIR WYN WILLIAMS: Yes, thank you.

MR BEER: Before I continue with the chronology in
Mr Thomas’ case, can we just return to
Ms Adedayo's case and just clarify couple of
points, in the light of the questions you asked
and the evidence that Mr Atkinson gave.

Can we start, please, Mr Atkinson, just by
explaining the different nature of appeals from
the Crown Court to the Court of Appeal Criminal
Division and from a Magistrates Court to a Crown
Court in CCRC reference cases.

Is it right that an appeal from the Crown
Court to the CCAD (sic) is, essentially,

a review of the safety of the conviction?

A. Yes.

Q. Whereas, if a person has pleaded guilty in the
Magistrates Court, there is no power to appeal,
unless the CCRC make a reference?

A. Yes.

first paragraph of that and it's dated
15 February 2013, and it reads:

“Thank you for your letter of 8 February
2013. We enclose in duplicate copies of
a Notice of Additional Evidence, the statements
of Stephen Bradshaw of 11 February 2013 and
Abdullah Patel of 13 February 2013 and
an up-to-date page count. There is no further
disclosure to be made in this case.”

Now, that's one subpostmaster, Mr Patel, and
essentially that statement simply says, "I've
had no significant shortages at there's been no
problems with the kit", and then simply says,
“and no further disclosure to be made”.

Now, the purpose of these statements was to
make the point that because subsequent
subpostmasters had experienced no significant
shortages, then there can have been no problems
with Horizon in Mr Ishaq's office at the time he
was involved with it.

Yes.

It was thus a point that the prosecution relied
on in respect of a material issue in the case
and it was therefore incumbent on the

prosecution to prove the point.
193

Now, as the reviewing lawyer, could Mr Smith —
forgive this, it may be a rhetorical question -
could he know that the data would not undermine
the prosecution case or assist the defence case
without seeing the data or asking Mr Bradshaw to
even to get the data?
I suppose it's a two-stage thing. If he had —
and it's not clear if he had from what you've
shown me — if he had the results of audits that
showed at points during that period that there
was nothing untoward, that would allow him then.
to assess whether the underlying data took
matters further but, on the face of this, they
weren't even giving any results as to audit.
Wasn't he, in essence, refusing the defence the
data to make its own checks on that point that
the prosecution wished to prove?
Certainly on what you were taking me through, it
appears that the defence were saying, in the
first instance, "Have you looked to see whether
there are any problems by looking for audits?"
That question, as far as I can see, was
never actually answered nor indeed asked by the
reviewing lawyer of the Investigator, and so the

decisions that, on the face of it, were being

I couldn't hear you, then, Mr Atkinson.

A. I'mso sorry: yes.

Q._ Having commenced on that strategy for proving
their case, it was an important part of proof of
the integrity of Horizon.

A. Yes

Q. The defence, in saying that they wished to audit
the data for that period, was indicating that it
wished to put the prosecution to proof on that
point?

A. Yes

Q._ Now, if the data for Birkenshaw Post Office,
after Mr Ishaq's suspension, had shown that
there had been shortages, that would obviously
undermine the prosecution case?

A Yes.

Q._It would mean that the prosecution couldn't
prove its point on that part of the case?

A. Yes, it would probably go beyond that, in terms
of calling the operation of the system into
question, as well as proving that their specific
point on it wasn't a valid one.

Q._ Asa natural corollary of that, it would assist
the defence case?

A. Absolutely.

knowledge, which is never the right position to

Q. And simply a bare assertion that there is no

explanation of that?

‘A. Well, making the assertion there's no further
