This is worth you all looking at. It is the note from Alex Chisholm to the SoS, following our meeting with him
this morning and his subsequent session with Tim Parker.
Hopefully it will enable us to break out of the current impasse with ministers.

While the note draws heavily on the advise that we gave him and the rest I drafted, I note that he has also put in
quite a lot of his own text, and changes the nuance of the note in places. He is evidently engaged in POL and has
his own views.

The crucial parts to note in his advice are:

- we should not ask for early sight of the the sparrow judgment and ministers should ‘stay above the fray’, not
comment on the verdict

- we should appoint Al as interim

- we should accept the retention payment but make it contingent on ‘performance conditions’ (unspecified)

- pol should appoint an interim cfo who sits on the board and the authority to appoint should be delegated to
POL

- POL has he potential to generate dividends in the ‘tens of millions’

Let’s see what ministers say in response. Please treat this as confidential - not to be communicated to POL.
Tom
