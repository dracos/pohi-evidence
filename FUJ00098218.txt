Current Horizon Network

¢ Major Milestones

* 1998 to 2000 — rolled out over 17,000 branches with ISDN dial on demand
(and satellite for those sites that couldn’t get ISDN)
Secured with VPN based on IPSEC technology

2002 moved to “always on” ISDN service to support banking
2004 Rollout of ADSL — 9,500 branches

2005 Network Backup facility for branches provided
¢ ISDN automatic backup for largest 2,000 branches

« “On demand” backup using mobile technology (engineer turns up if fault lasts for more
than 2 days)

2006 / 2007 Moving to Fujitsu Services ADSL

¢« Measures

¢ All online Transactions
* per month - 35.5 million
¢ Peak online TPS — 186
° % Failure Rate — (Approximately) 0.33
¢ DVLA Transactions
* per month - 3.7 million
Peak online TPS — 33
% Failure Rate — 0.45 (but also includes any non Horizon DVLA failures)
DVLA services use Web services technology
Feedback to Post Master when network not available

¢ Inter Campus Services
¢ SAN extension (2 G Fibre channel)
¢ IP Traffic (1 G Ethernet)
¢ Interfaces from managed shared service

¢ Resilient services based on two separate Dark Fibres between Data
Centres each terminating on separate Component (DWDM)

¢ Latency bounded as point to point services with max specified distance

¢ SAN

¢ The SAN connectivity for HNG-x will be implemented using Cisco MDS9509
Director Class fibre channel switches in order to take advantage of the
added availability and stability associated with this class of hardware.

¢ There will be a two SAN Directors deployed at each HNG-X data centre.
Both power and FC cabling will be fully resilient

HNGX Network External Interfaces 1

* Interface between HNG-X and third party
¢ Not just connection but formal interface e.g. EPAY, DVLA

* Two classes

¢ Interface is remote from data centre
¢ Examples DVLA, RMG, EPAY

« Interface is local to HNGX data centre
« Examples Streamline, Link and EDS

¢ General approach
¢ Remote interfaces;- no change to Physicals, IP routing and IP addressing
¢ Local interfaces;- Agree Interface changes to support new data centres
¢ All interfaces;- Agree operational acceptance method & criteria

¢ Data Centre Phasing
« New Data centres join network
« 4 Data centre working phase (single network)
¢ Old Data Centres leave network
« Examples of Techniques being used

¢ Traffic steering via IP Routing for Branches

¢ Subnet migration resulting from constraint on keeping IP addresses the same to
simplify data centre move
