Yes that fine. I will try and run a Royal Mail sales report on Monday and see if there are any unusual sales.
Thanks

I think this is not resolved as yet. Shall we try to get some time next week to determine what we can do. It may be as
simple as, in the absence of stock adjustments/stamp declarations, we can conclude that the only way the branch can
hold correct stock levels would be by recording phantom sales?

Hi Rachelle,
Thanks for the information.

The whole issue is not my expertise, and I could only act on the spread sheets which were sent to me.

It is a shame your one was not sent out when we originally requested information. I spent hours comparing the
spread sheets and calculating!

We have your contact number now should there be future errors.

You are correct that the branch when balancing was remming in instead of reversing to correct the figures. This has
been going on since the end of August 2013.

There has been rems from November reversed out in January, so this added to the confussion. The manager also
remmed in incorrect figures which added to the loss. A relief postmaster thought he would help and reversed other
figures out, just adding to the issues. By the time the office requested help, five months of continuous errors had
taken place . We can only get limited information from the Horizon, and once the office has completed the Trading
Statement, we are unable to correct the errors.

It is a relief to know it is now being resolved.
Kind regards

Elaine/Jacqui
Please see attached spread sheet.

¢ = On the first tab called ‘Incorrect remittances’, this shows where the branch have created a ‘ phantom rem’
that doesnt exist from Swindon. If you look at most of them they seem to be odd amounts whereas Swindon
only despatches in round. This also shows what affect it would have on the branch if they adjusted the stock
to correct.

® On the second tab called ‘Difference’, this highlights where the branch have remmed in but doesn’t match
the Swindon despatch. This also shows what affect it would have on the branch if they adjusted the stock to
correct.

¢ On the tabs ‘Balances out’, this is possibly where the branch have incorrectly remmed in and then completed
a rem reversal to put the stock correct.

. The tab ‘Corrected remittances’ , this is where Swindon despatches match off with what the office have
remmed in.

¢ On the last tab ‘Not remmed in’ this only has 4 items that have not been remmed in and also shows you the
value of the stock.

The branch have settled a loss of £7738.72 centrally but if the offices had adjusted all the errors to correct there
should be a loss of £8627.57. Has the Postmaster put sales through instead to correct the stock and if so do we know
what date?

Many thanks
