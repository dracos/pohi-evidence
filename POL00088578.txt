All,
Thanks for your input at the meeting on 8" February, hopefully we are now getting near to the finalised document.

Andy thanks for circulating the actions and the updated document reflecting the changes to the wording agreed at the
meeting.

{have now attached what I hope is the final draft version of the document. I have added several other minor changes to
the document which I have highlighted in yellow.

{have also:-
Inserted the letters in the appendices which support 6.4.7 (Dawn P I have removed the word enforce from the
title of the fourth letter as this did not sit well with the wording of this section).
- The two routes for dispute referred to in section 12 are now in the appendices (Dawn P thanks for reviewing the
text}
- I will once we submit the document for sign off embed the write off policy as an appendix.
- {have included page numbers (top right) and version control details in the footer of each document.

Please can I ask you to complete a final review before I submit for approval.
Please can you let me have any comments by close of play on Tuesday 26 February.
Thanks

John
