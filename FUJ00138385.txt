All journal messages arriving at the data centre are retained for audit. Occasionally SSC may need to ask for data to be retrieved to enable
issues which happened more than six months ago to be investigated (less than six months, there may still be sufficient and more accessible
information in BRS).

When asking for transactions for a FAD and date range, ask for the QUERY_AT\FINAL \Filteredhx.xml file which will contain all transactions
for a given date range and FAD code in XML format. These will however lack the JSN and ReqMessagelD.

The alternative is raw files containing data for all 80 or so branches in the FAD hash, which is far harder to read but does contain JSN and
ReqMessagelD.

Route the Peak with the request to Security Ops.

If you think the call may be part of a Post Office investigation into a branch that might lead to litigation, then this should not be handled by
SSC unless already authorised by the SSC manager.
