Hi Anne;

if we need the call log information from Fujitsu to help Keith, what is our process? Do we need to send the request to PO
Security? Or can we send the request to ATOS as normal?

Kind Regards;
{brahim

Please can you pick this up regarding Fleckney
Hi Andrew,

This will be picked up by the Contract Advisor not by an intervention visit.

Good morning,

We have received a call from Jay at the above branch. He has seen the BBC report concerning the system issues and is
claiming that his system is corrupt. He wants all the money back from previous discrepancies which he has put in so he
could balance. He has been to Horizon/Atos who have checked everything and can find no system issues but he is
adamant it’s a system issue. He did mention to me that he has been using official post to recoup some of his losses
which I don’t think he should have mentioned. He does this because there is a glitch with ref data and this was
confirmed in Sub Space. This glitch adds a label to his stack which is settled to cash but he cannot reverse this as there is
no label to reverse. He has not indicated an amount or a timescale of this refund that he wants. Would it be possible to
arrange an intervention visit possibly first thing so they can witness this system glitch.

If you need anything more please don’t hesitate to contact me.

Regards,
Andrew
