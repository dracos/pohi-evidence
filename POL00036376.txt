SSK — USER ADMIN — LOSS IN STOCK UNIT — LOSS IN STOCK UNIT

Branch has a loss in their Self Service Kiosk

If branches are calling to report losses in their SSK's then they must be advised to follow the end of
day and end of trading period procedures as laid out in the User Guide and on the laminated sheets
with which they were supplied. ALSO SEE SSK - USER ADMIN - END OF DAY & SSK —- USER ADMIN —
END OF TRADING PERIOD

Where a branch cannot get the SSK to balance, a suggested option from Tom Pegler, Crown
Productivity & Service Manager is start from scratch as follows:

e Run all the reports,

e Empty the kiosk,

¢ Rollover into a new BP,

e Show the discrepancy then commission the SSK with cash,

* Run the reports and rollover on Horizon again — hopefully showing a compensating +/-.

I know the above does take time but may be the only way to solve the problem.
