You will shortly receive an invitation to a Horizon Investigation Risk workshop.

The purpose of the workshop is to identify, quantify and produce mitigation plans for the risks associated with the
horizon investigation and related activities, including an improvement project to respond to the findings.

I will sent you more back ground information closer to the workshop.
Regards, Simon
