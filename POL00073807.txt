Hi Carol

Further to your email I deem this to be extrmely fair and reasonable and accept this repayment over the 6 months.

How do I go about making this good? Can this be taken direct from my salary? Do I send a payment each month to your
offices made payable to Post Office Limited? Can we set up a standing order?

Many thanks for your time, patience and understanding

Best regards

Kevin

Dear Ms Ballan

I hope this email finds you well, I have had trouble allocating a telephone number for you and after many a phone call,
I was given this email address.

I have recently received a letter dated 22nd February 2013 with regards to the recent audit at my office and the discovery
of a scratch card discrepancy for £1,840.00, relating back to April 2008.

As mentioned and I have now seen, after your discusions with Alan Lusher and Andy Winn this discrepancy will still be
held accountable to my office and that the error is proper. The letter you attach from Andy Winn explaining his findings
after my original email prognosis to him, is the first time I have seen this. I never received such communication,
otherwise I would of dealt with this before now so my apologies for the delay.

As stated I still cant believe such a huge error in a short space of time was affiliated to my office and all the paperwork I
sent across and have kept since 2008 was not enough evidence for my case. The telephone conversations I had on
those days are written down and minuted as well as exact times and dates as I was sure this would come back to me at
that this is incorrect.

However I know that this will now never be resolved in my favour. With this in point I am accepting this error on a agree to
disagree basis and do not want this email to constitute a forefiet to admittance of such incompatence on my behalf.

As the error is going back some 5 YEARS I was hoping that as per your letter I could come to some sort of fair and
reasonable payment plan in order to clear the monies and put this matter to bed once and for all. As you can imagine to
find £1,840 just like that in these climates is a big ask, however please could we come to an arrangement?

I love my job and working for the Post Office, I give my all and work very hard to protect the brand and customer
experience of using the Post Office.

Many thanks for your time
Best Regards

Kevin Palmer
