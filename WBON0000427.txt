Tom

Please find attached my first draft of the comprehensive summary. The document is pretty large and I think it may
need cutting down but please let me know any comments you may have.

I am going to proof read it tomorrow on the train tomorrow morning so will let you know if there are any substantive
changes.

Many thanks
Amy

See attached — as discussed.
Counsel has asked for someone (you) to provide a comprehensive summary of the components of each of the legal

claims, and any factors relevant to the claims as advanced. Please could you do some fairly comprehensive research
into each claim and the legal components of the same.

To date I have produced this high level table (based only on the claim form). You will need to review the Letter of
Claim , consider the current claims as made, and then seek to add meat to the bones of the documents.

I suggest you refer to PLC, Lexis, Halsbury's, and any other texts specific to the component claims.
