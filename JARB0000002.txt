Subject: Post Office threats! !

Dear Mr Arbuthnot,
My name is David Bristow, I run the Odiham Post Office in the High St.
Until 6 months ago I was the Sub postmaster, with a contract to operate the post office.

Post Office Ltd have however taken my contract away, and are demanding I pay them £42,000 +, or
they will commence legal proceedings.

My predicament is very similar to many postmasters/mistresses around the country.
You may be aware of the similar case of Mrs Hamilton at the South Warnborough Post Office.

This morning your colleague Mr David Jones MP phoned me about this matter.

One of his constituents has been subjected to the same problem.

He intends to request a public inquiry in the house of commons, concerning the Post Office and the
Horizon system.

He ask me to make you aware of my problem.

My solicitor from Tanner and Taylor will also be writing to you.

I would be very grateful to you for any attention that you can give this matter and support you can
give me and Mr Jones MP(Con).
yours sincerely,

David Bristow
