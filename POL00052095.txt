Dear Sirs,

We write in relation to the statement which was received by us on 15" July 2009. It
was previously agreed, in the confiscation timetable, that the Prosecution’s statement
would be served upon the defence by 10" July 2009.

As this statement was served later than the set timetable we therefore request that
the defence be granted an extension of time to serve the response. However, we are
unable to stipulate a specific date for the service of the defence response at this time
for the following reasons.

We note that the Prosecution are seeking to set the benefit figure to the value of
£310,460.14 on the basis that our client is alleged to have benefitted as follows:

Benefit from conviction

« Theft £43,894.15

« The gross turnover of the business £266,565.99
during the relevant period

Total £310,460.14

However, Prosecuting Counsel clearly stated in open Court at the hearing on 1°' May
2009, that the total figure you would be seeking was £44,689.82 and that
arrangements were in hand as £1000 per month was being deducted, at source from
Michael Rudkin’s salary. We would seek to rely upon this statement to limit the
benefit figure to the amount of the theft and will make representations to this effect in
due course.

August to enable us to deal with this matter before the Court. In the meantime we
