The latest draft of the note on Horizon access is attached. This describes the position as I understand it based on the
Deloitte report but this needs to go past FJ / Deloitte to confirm the position.

Hi - as ever, it is far more important that we get this right that do it quickly.
If this is the remote access point - Andy, what progress has been made with Deloitte?

A couple of Second Sight draft case reports have referenced access to the Horizon system.
lam currently putting together a note on this (just in terms of what has been said and where).

We need to formulate a response on the individual cases this week (this is urgent) and also agree how we address
this issue going forward with Second Sight.

Would it be possible for you to let me have any times you may be available tomorrow for a conference call to
discuss.

I have copied Amanda who will set this up for us. I can make myself available at any time except between 3-4.

James, please feel free to invite any others from Fujitsu as appropriate.

Best wishes
Belinda
