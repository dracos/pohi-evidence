Subject: "RE: Horizon Claims - personnel issues

Dear me. This is not good. What is driving this resistance I wonder?

As an aside, the more I read about the involvement of Rodric Williams in the guts of much of the activity
associated with the cover-up allegations, the more astonished I am that he was anywhere remotely near
the Horizon Comps or Prosecutions review schemes at all. It is actually worse than was apparent when he
have evidence.

All best

Thank you for your email and I appreciate the strong feelings on this subject.

As previously advised, this is a live issue, actions have been agreed with the Post Office Board and are being
implemented, with the next update scheduled for September. As you know I do listen very carefully to feedback from
the Advisory Board and where I can, act on the same.

Given the strength of feeling and importance of this issue, I understand that this is on the agenda for your meeting
with the Post Office Chairman when you meet with him on the 29" August.

Thank you for this update. Hope you are well.

We are not happy with the situation. The basic point that the victims and the public would want to know is that there
are no individuals who were involved in cognate roles (not just decision making) in any Horizon cases, regardless of
whether any wrongdoing is alleged, who are now involved in any compensation claims.

We do not see this as an issue of ‘balancing’. Individuals either were or were not involved previously, and outsiders’
trust will not be supported if there is not a clear binary yes/no answer or any lack of clarity.

I hope you can rethink as necessary and confirm the position.

Regards,
Chris

Chris
Trusting you are well.

I am coming back to you as advised below, following the Post Office Board of 8th July where the matter of ‘Past Roles’
was discussed. My apologies about the delay in reverting with a further update.

There are currently 73 employees working within Post Office's Remediation Unit (RU) who were also employed by
Post Office during the period currently being considered by the Inquiry. The majority of those employed during this
period were in unrelated roles, for example they were branch counter employees. A minority were employed in related
roles, such as branch auditors and trainers - Post Office required employees with these skill sets in RU because they
had the skills, experience, and knowledge necessary to stand up and run the schemes. Their knowledge of legacy
internal processes and systems were critical and remain important to the delivery of Redress.

Whilst these individuals were employed during the relevant period, there has been no suggestion that they have
committed any wrongdoing. Critically none of these employees have ever had any role in decision making on redress
outcomes. They predominantly undertake technical data gathering exercises or fulfil administrative functions. As you
know, Post Office have the independent external panel review for redress in the Horizon Shortfall Scheme and
disputed issues on Overturned Convictions cases, which adds further independent oversight over these processes.

Notwithstanding that position, Post Office are alive to the perception this creates externally. Post Office has
undertaken a full review of this issue in consideration of reasonable steps to mitigate the impact of this, whilst
balancing the need to be fair and follow due process in relation to Post Office employees and Post Office’s
employment obligations. Following this review, actions, agreed by Board on 8th July will be implemented. We can
provide further detail after the 24th of September Board noting these actions will first need to be communicated to any
potentially impacted individuals.

Separate to the exercise described above, where it is alleged that any employee was guilty of misconduct relating to
the work they performed previously, Post Office will investigate those allegations. If the allegations are proven
following an investigation, Post Office will take appropriate disciplinary action.

Simon

Thanks for the update.

We have two concerns: one is about supporting trust of the victims in the compensation arrangements (and anything
else relevant) but the other is about timing, given the extensive ongoing bad publicity emanating from the Inquiry at
the same time as the ongoing and imminent new compensation arrangements. So anything you can deliver on the
reassurance issue around the involvement of individuals, but also swiftly, would be useful.

Thanks, and best wishes,
Chris

Morning Simon
Hope you are well.

We held an HCAB meeting yesterday, at least semi-informally, and no minutes will be published until a new
Government is in place. It is interesting that there are so many issues continuing to require attention.

We noted your letter, for which we were grateful. Thank you for your kind offer to brief us further: we didn’t feel it
necessary yesterday, not least in the light of electoral purdah. But we would be grateful for a further update. We note
your ongoing review. The view was expressed that one might expect the answer in relation to individuals (about
previous involvement and hence ongoing involvement on sub-postmaster and mistress matters) to be either yes or
no, so we’re intrigued to know more about the substance of the review, and its timing.

Thanks and regards,
Chris
