Dear David,

ICL PATHWAY / POCL DRAFT AGREEMENT POC001

I refer to my telephone conversation with you of the 25th May in which we
spoke about the discontinuation of ICL Pathway’s agreement with the
Department of Social Security for the use of the benefit payment card.

This letter formally confirms what we already know. The DSS have withdrawn
from the project. There will be a transition period lasting until no later than
19th July 1999, during which time existing cardholders will have their cards
replaced by order books. Thereafter cards will no longer be used. In the
meantime no new cards will be issued to new cardholders; there might be a few
cards issued to existing cardholders who lose their cards. Should any such
replacement cards be issued during this period, we will continue to have them
made by De La Rue, despatched via Royal Mail and would like to have them
issued by yourselves. However the quantity of these will be extremely limited
if indeed there are any at all. We would of course pay you to issue them at the
rates that have prevailed until now.

Under the circumstances I therefore regret to inform you that once the
transition period has ended we do not expect to procure any further card issue
services from you.

May I take this opportunity to thank you and your colleagues for the work you
have all done as our sub-contractor for this project. It has been a pleasure
doing business with you.
