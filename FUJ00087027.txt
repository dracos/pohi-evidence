This is useful. I do think that we still need to meet with SS as the questions they have asked are broadly in line with what we
discussed.

Simon: has this been set up?
Thx

I have now received a response from lan Henderson (Second Sight) clarifying the specific line of enquiry in their
current investigations into the POL Bracknell site.

lan’s specific questions are listed in his email below. They primarily concentrate on Horizon system data access
capabilities and controls rather than procedures. To provide greater context, also attached is the spot review that
outlines the specific allegation.

As a matter of urgency, could you provide a response to each of lan’s points and feed these back to me asap. I
suggest your responses are clear paragraphed statements rather than a provision of further information via
attachments etc.

I will then collate and formally feedback to lan.

Please also note the potential that a further line of questions may be created from Second Sight’s ongoing review of
the information they have recently received.

Thanks as always for your co-operation.

I’m sorry for the delay in replying. There’s a lot going on at the moment...
I attach a copy of Spot Review 5 which describes the allegations that have been made.

The emails that have been forwarded to you appear to describe matters that may be relevant to the allegation. Please
note that we are primarily interested in finding out the following:

1. What capabilities did the POL Bracknell team have? (As far as TC or Rem Out type transactions or Journal
adjustments are concerned)

2. What were the PHYSICAL or LOGICAL controls over their use of the systems available to them?

3. What audit trail is available to show the extent that they posted TC or Rem Out type transactions, or Journal
adjustments?

4, Can we reply of the COMPLETENESS of the audit trail? i.e. does it record all transactions or just transactions
meeting certain criteria? Is it protected from user manipulation?

5. What USER ID was used if TC type transactions or journal adjustments were posted?

Could the POL Bracknell team log on with either super user or SMPR credentials?

7. How would TC, Rem Out or Journal Adjustment type transactions executed by the POL Bracknell team be
seen by SPMR of Branches affected by those actions?

2

There are probably other questions / issues that will arise after you have had a preliminary look at this.

Please note that we’re not really interested in what the procedures manual says about any of this. We need to look at
whether it would be possible for a rogue employee to do what is alleged and what log files would be generated to
record that activity. Please note that I have now been provided with a second batch of employee email and I may find
other emails that are potentially relevant to this matter.

Thank you for your help with this

Hi lan

I’ve been forwarded the email stream below however having not been party to prior conversations or spoken to
Susan as she is formally off-work I just need to understand the context of the enquiry as the email pdf’s attached are a
collection of individual instances rather than a clear line.
My perception of what I think you need is;
1) Aclear documentation/articulation of the end-to-end Transaction Corrections process, how it is applied and
the sign-off authorities that are in place (e.g. subpostmaster acceptance etc.).

2) An understanding of how the attached email instances relate to that process and authorities.

Let me know if I’m on the right lines or not.

Thanks
