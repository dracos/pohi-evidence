THEORY SESSION

While one Tutor is going through the theory session the other is to “load” himself
ready to be searched in the clothing search practical exercise that follows
immediately afterwards.

Stress to the delegates that we are going to go through the theory session very
quickly as the points are covered in the module and handout - this is very much a
refresher session only.

Tutors to be aware that this theory session is on general matters — at the start of
each session during the day there is time allocated to discuss the practicalities of
how each type of search is carried out.

To consider the following issues in general questioning and discussion (all areas will
have been covered in the search e-learning module, the search handout and
general questioning earlier in the course):
