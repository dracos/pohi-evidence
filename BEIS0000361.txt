HORIZON: REPORT TO MINISTERS

Please see the attached submission and DTI text (you already have a hard copy of
the draft Treasury report to which it refers) which represents where we have got
to so far this afternoon. I will minute further this evening/over the

weekend once the next (?final) version of the report has emerged from the
Treasury. However I have just been told that the Treasury have now accepted
that the additional factors I have been banging on about - the greater potential
for POCL to earn commercial revenue under Option B because of the early
deployment of the smartcard; and the underestimate of the true costs of
termination - should be looked at again over the weekend By KPMG and the
parties. There may therefore be last-minute (and perhaps significant) material
to be fed in and commented on immediately before the 12.15 meeting on Monday
morning. I will of course be available for briefing if needed.
