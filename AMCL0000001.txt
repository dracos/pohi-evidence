Dear Sirs,
RE: Our Client: Alan McLaughlin

We refer to the above client and to our letter to you dated 23 December 2021 which we
enclose for ease of refence.

As you are aware, this matter has been listed to be mentioned before the Court of Appeal on
Monday 12" September 2022.

To date, we have not received a formal response from you regarding this letter. We note that
Vivienne O’Neill of PPS had contacted our office by phone on the 23" August 2022, however
no formal response has been forthcoming. We would ask for a response as a matter of
urgency.

Further to this, we have taken instructions from our client who has advised that in or around
November 2004, Mr McLaughlin along with his solicitor and McClure Watters (forensic
accountants) had met with head Post Office prosecutor, Suzanne Winters, senior POCL
management representatives and, our client believes, a representative of the PPS to reveal
evidence of how Horizon had systematically generated a series of transactions independently
of him or his staff.

Our instructions are that this meeting occurred at Tomb Street, Royal Mail HQ in November
2004.

In light of the above we would ask for disclosure of all notes, records and documents in
respect of this meeting.

We ask for this as we are aware that the prosecutions against postmasters brought by the
PPSNI were formally outside the scope of the Post-Conviction Disclosure Exercise and also
the notifications by mail to Potential Future Appellants as they were not prosecuted by Post
Office.

Nevertheless, we are aware that Post Office have shared all the data that they had on Northern
Ireland prosecutions with the PPSNI and this disclosure request is on that basis.

Yours faithfully
