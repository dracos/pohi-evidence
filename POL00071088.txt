I had a telephone conversation with Cheryl Woodward. This was a catch-up call to discuss
progress on the case. Cheryl is based at Chesterfield and works on the business side.

Summarising the Claim and the Defence to her. Explaining that what initially started as a
debt recovery matter has now turned into a much broader point given the horizon type
Defence of Mr Castleton and that Post Office Legal consider that if they are seen to settle on
this Case, or walk away, then that will open floodgates for lots of other Sub-Postmaster
claims given that they are all talking to each other on blogging websites, however explaining
to her the costs given 7-10 days in Court and ten or more witnesses could well be two or
three hundred thousand pounds. Accordingly, if you look at the Case in isolation it is
completely nonsensical, especially given that Mr Castleton’s asset position suggests that he
would be unable to pay. However, the PO have taken a broader view.

Also explained to Cheryl that I will need to take a Witness Statement from somebody in
Chesterfield and interview them next week. Statements have got to be exchanged in
September. Explaining that I need somebody from the Cheque Team who cancelled all the
cheques. She will speak to her Manager and will get a Manager to call me and give me an
idea of who to speak to. She also confirmed that Girobank were based in Liverpool.

We agreed that I would hear from her Manager later today.

Time engaged - 24 mins.
