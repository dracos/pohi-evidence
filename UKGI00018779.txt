Subject: POL settlement authority

Ben

Further to your confirmation of your understanding that the mediation authority EEE did
not include the 5.5m for ClJ costs it is worth recording that from our perspective we thought the
authority did include those costs i.e. it was to cover POL’s total liability for the Group litigation
claim not including its own costs.

On further reflection we don’t think the various papers and advice were as clear as they could
be on this. Hopefully the point will be academic in the sense that any settlement figure reached
with the claimants will be below even including the £5.5m ClJ costs but if settlement is not
achieved we will want to bear this in mind when it comes to levels of Part 36 offers etc.

Kind regards

Richard
