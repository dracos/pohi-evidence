Have received a defence statement today, despite the telephone conversation yesterday. A hard copy
has been put in the post today.

At point 2 the Defence allege that any discrepancy was as a result of the Horizon system. There is also a
challenge to the initial missing figure of £18,000 which was reduced according to the Defence statement
in a matter of minutes. The statement also maintains that further investigation by the auditor “would have
discovered the whereabouts of the alleged missing sum’.

Clearly if there were to be a plea to false accounting but on the basis that the Horizon system was at fault
that would not be an acceptable basis of plea for the prosecution.

Have spoken to defence solicitor who indicated that the Defendant may be willing to plead to false
accounting and pay money back. Taken instructions from Chris who has confirmed that he would be
happy to proceed on this basis. The defence have now said that it I highly likely that she will plead to false
accounting. The matter is in defence counsel's hands and the likelihood is that the case may be listed
early. Will let agents know the position.

Kind regards,

Rob
