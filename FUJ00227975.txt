All,

1. ARQ 295: This is OK

2. ARQ 297: This is OK

3. ARQ 298: Probably not an issue. However it is worth getting SSC to check that the CASEPOSSImpact
events are benign. These all occur about 19:00 and seem to happen most days so they may cause a problem
(but not necessarily one that affects audit). Rest are OK

Regards

Gareth
