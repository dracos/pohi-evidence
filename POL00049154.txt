REGINA v JOSEPHINE HAMILTON
(SOUTH WARNBOROUGH}
WINCHESTER CROWN COURT
MENTION - 19™ NOVEMBER 2007
CASE NO: POLTD/0506/0685,

I refer to previous correspondence regarding this matter.

As you know there has been some discussion as to whether or not pleas to false
accounting would be acceptable. I note this would be agreeable providing that
Mrs Hamilton were to repay the full amount.

On Counsel's request this matter has been listed for Mention on the 19" November
2007. The purpose of this is to see whether or not the trial can be vacated. It is
possible that Mrs Hamilton may wish to enter pleas to false accounting. I understand
however that she is not yet in a position to repay and has not given a date as to when
this can be done.

One option would be for the theft count to be left on file pending payment by the date
of trial or some later date.

Ged

Could you let me have your views as to confiscation in this matter, and if appropriate
the prospect of recovery under such an order. A copy of the Indictment is attached.
