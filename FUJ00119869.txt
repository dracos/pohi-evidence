The following were agreed:

e Pathway would write up the results of the last 100-cover laboratory tests and submit a report to POCL.

e Pathway and POCL would conduct data analysis to validate the DSS proposition that there has been a higher level of impound
rates on OBCS compared with ESNS yet, as they were all valid books, there must therefore be a higher rate of false rejection
(impounds) on OBCS than on ESNS. Pathway will conduct the data analysis and validation work for OBCS; POCL will
conduct the work for ESNS.

¢ Pathway will set up field validation of actual rejects occurring in outlets. The validation tests will determine the cause of the
rejects as between scanner, user, paper, ink, damage, condition etc. This activity is expected to require a mobile laboratory
facility.

¢ POCL will seek observation of the field validation tests by DSS observers.

© POCL will request the DSS to provide the covers off books rejected during field validation &/or historically rejected books to
Pathway for laboratory testing.

© POCL will check training course material for the adequacy of scanner user training and/or instructions.

¢ POCL will obtain the DSS’s buy-in to the above approach to the resolution of this AI.

It was expected that Karen Rogers would co-ordinate this activity for POCL and that John Dicks would initially do so for
Pathway.

occur. Target is for the lab to be in operation on 7" and/or 9" Sept. Pathway will attempt to provide bar-code evaluation

4. 73 POCL to escalate with DSS the need to be involved in the activities (a) providing impounded books for further testing and (by 3% Sept I 6" Sept

Workshop 4 Update: DSS (Steph Fowler) has noted that their concern with the proposal to provide impounded books is (a) 9M Sept 9 Sept
getting agreement from DSS Security and (b) concerns around the delay in returning books. POCL (Bruce MeNiven via John
Meagher) to escalate this with DSS (Ken Davenport and Vince Gaskell) to try to get their agreement.
Workshop 5 Update: Vince Gaskell no longer involved in this area. John Meagher to speak to Ken Davenport to determine 13" Sept
appropriate operational contacts in DSS to be involved with on-going issues around the service.

5. 3 Pathway reported that about 90% of books not scanned were from 4 or 5 offices. Pathway will undertake root cause analysis of 6" Sept
these offices.
Workshop 4 Update: Analysis of single office with 50% of failures indicates incorrect procedure being used in outlet. POCL 9 Sept
(Dave McLaughlin via John Meagher) to telephone to determine reason for high failure rates in the other cluster offices.
Workshop 5 Update: Ring around cluster offices has identified a number of causes of user problems with system. There is 13" Sept
some justifiable confusion with the procedures (having to do different processes in similar, but different circumstances). A
reference data change will help with one misleading icon, John Meagher to action change.

6. 15 POCL (John Meagher) and Pathway (John Dicks) to develop a joint rectification plan for presentation to DSS. This rectification I 15" Sept 17" Sept
plan to include the targeting of cluster offices (Pathway providing the MIS/POCL to determine and manage the process for
