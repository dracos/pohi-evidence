SOLICITOR NOT REQUIRED AT THIS TIME.

Basically what happened on 3 February which is the
Friday just gone the investigation team received a
telephone call from the audit team who was at your office
with is The Grange in Rayleigh and they'd reported that
there was an audit shortage of just under £15,000.

SP OK.

LA And you’re the sub postmistress of that post office.

SP Yeah.

LA You are yeah? How long have you been there Sue as
sub postmistress?

SP September — 15 months.

LA 15 months right OK.

SP I’ve been in charge you know when Mr Patel left he left

me in charge there for the last 13 months. I’ve only been
5.21 the postmistress for; I've been charge of it for 3’ years.
LA Right OK. Now the result of this audit was made up
basically of £5,100 that you said was in an ATM and
£9,845 which related to instants scratch cards.

SP Right.

LA Yeah do you wanna tell me,

SP Do you wanna breakdown?

LA Do you want to tell me about the ATM machine first of all?
SP OK. What happened was because the PO only deals with

certain banks -

SP - we thought it would be a good idea to have an ATM
installed so that people who couldn't use the post office
they still had the facility -

LA Right.

SP - to draw cash ‘cos obviously they'd leave the shop and
then obviously go somewhere else. So we had that
installed but I wasn’t prepared for how much cash it took.

So-

LA When did you have that installed?

SP Right oh I should’ve looked at the date shouldn't I?
January.

LA Beginning of January?

SP Yeah, can I show, NOT AUDIBLE

6.26 LA I’ve got some sheets here that you gave me on Friday -
SP OK. NOT AUDIBLE
LA If I can just for the purpose of the tape just explain these

are A4 sheets of paper that are listed from Thursday to
Wednesday and then we've got a breakdown of all the
notes and coin it’s written in pencil and there are -

SP Yeah.

LA 1, 2,

SP They're just as we do them every evening. The top here
is scratch cards

LA Your pointing to S&M

SP Scratch cards.

So on this particular sheet which is, it’s not dated or
anything, you’re pointing to -

That is scratch cards.

Scratch cards and then it says 2,500.

Yeah.

Right.

That was in error note and they told me I had to put them
through.

Right.

And I didn’t agree with them but she said they had to go
through the system. So I just wrote them as odds
because I wanted somebody to come and sort it out with
me.

Right OK.

But that’s been going on a little while.

How long’s that been going on?

I can’t think. Because I haven’t been in the post office I
couldn’t think how far it went back, but it’s -

Has it gone months or weeks?

Yeah months.

Months.

What they were they were error notices they said that had
been activated. Then they sent me reams of paper and I

obviously they’re only there 9 ‘til 5 when I’m in the post
office and I’ve got all the, I know it sounds stupid NOT
AUDIBLE.

No that’s all right. Yeah.

I just can’t believe that this sorry, so I just wrote it as
though oh it’s written, it’s all

So have you brought the error notices to account, is that
what you’ve done?

I bought them to account because they told me I had to.
Right so -

So it wasn’t NOT AUDIBLE so I just put them through.
Right.

Not trying to but there is nobody to contact now. When
Nick Kerr came, he’s our -

Yeah.

He’s, I used to speak to Deidre South.

Yeah.

She used to, but then they said she doesn’t deal with that
anymore. There is actually nobody. You have to dial
through to the -

Helpline.

Helpline or NSBC

Yeah and then they couldn’t help me. Like when the
office was closed for a week we had no online or anything
and I kept saying to them you know I need some help
here. Nobody did anything. I couldn’t get anybody down

to come and see me. I mean there was a loss that week
which obviously I put in, you know but they’ve never
explained to me what happened. You know I feel I don’t
know. So that’s that.

LA So 2500 -

SP NOT AUDIBLE cash that I put in.

LA So this is £2,500 this is scratch cards that you brought to
account -

SP Yeah.

LA - and you're basically carrying that as a cash figure -

SP Yeah.

LA - because you’ve not put the £2,500 cash in to account for

the error notice.

SP No.

LA Right OK. So underneath we’ve got 900 and what’s 900?
SP That’s cash.

LA And what cash is that?

SP That I put into the ATM machine.

LA Right that’s outside of the post office?

SP Because if you look on all these, I don’t do it, like I did it,

that’s the carry figure. Unfortunately my accountant. I
cant believe I’m saying this myself. Right because my
books had to go and she had my cheque book and
everything to go with my ‘cos we’re like doing end of year
accounts and that, I didn’t have a cheque book to put it in
but I suppose NOT AUDIBLE. OK but if you look here,
see it’s not here. This is just that NOT AUDIBLE and

these are odd amounts that we have, you know mutilated

9.34 LA Right OK so these -
SP So the ATM is oh from there.
LA That’s the 8, £900.
SP And that’s where I’ve put cash, where I’ve put it in the
ATM. See where I've listed it all?
LA Right yeah. So you've got, this is the 3" sheet prior to

front one. You've got £900 and you carried forward
£900and that’s just £900 in the ATM machine is it?

SP Yeah that’s just a changed figure because -

LA So that’s all you putting in the ATM machine you say is
£900?

SP Well and then I, like there, oh no I didn’t do that, that’s no,

what's that? You see sometimes people bank late and
then we add the figures -

LA Right you carry them forward and you hold them -

SP If we’ve done the cash dec -

LA Right yeah.

SP - then if say Swallow Aquatics or somebody else bank
late -

LA Yeah.

SP - then we would just add that figure to there, but the 9 is
where I have listed it as cash that I have (over speak)

LA Right so basically you’ve not put the £900 in each day?

SP Oh no, no, no.

LA It's just one lot of £900?

SP Yeah. It’s just where I did, what happened was the
machine breaks, the machine breaks and then I had the
engineer out and then he said about filling it up. I didn’t
have cash on me.

LA So what did you do then when the engineer said about
filling it up?

SP I just borrowed, used Post Office money

LA You used the post office money? How much?

SP I wrote it on the

LA Right OK so how much do you use at the PO to put into
the ATM machine?

SP That's all that 900.

LA Just £900?

SP And then, I wasn’t there Thursday I have Thursday’s off. I

11.12 don’t know what without asking Mo -

LA Does anybody else have access to the ATM machine or is
it -

SP No only I’ve got, my husband and myself -

LA Just yourself.

SP ‘cos it’s part of the shop.

LA Right.

SP Although it’s in where the post office is -

LA Yeah.

SP - it’s not in the post office.

LA It's not post office business is it? It’s your own private
business.

How much did you put in the ATM machine originally
then?

A 1000. We just hold a 1000 in there because I didn’t
know how much it would use.

Right so that £1,000 has that come from the post office
originally?

No that was my money. It’s just where it keeps chewing
the money and then obviously we have to empty it ‘cos it’s
and then as I say when the engineer came out and he
sorted it out then that’s when I’ve put the money in.
Right because the understanding that I had from the audit
shortage was that £5,100 of it was related to the ATM
machine.

No I said to them that’s scratch cards and no.

Right so -

I know I’ve, but then I panicked.

Right OK.

You know when they came I sort of, but this, I’ve all the
documentation for this.

Right OK. You're pointing to the 2,500 for the scratch
cards.

This 14 20 I can’t believe I did this. Is erm, somebody
wanted me to do some specials, 2 special delivery and I
did specials and I should’ve just -

Right that’s, OK. So basically -

It's all written down.

Yeah so we're £2,600 adrift somewhere then aren’t we?

Version 3.0 11/02
POL00053009
POL00053009

Record of Tape Recorded Interview (continued)

SP Why?
12.37 LA Because the audit shortage was £14,700 and the instants
were 9,845 and they’ve got down as the ATM machine
was 5,100.
SP Right what happened is on my cash decs -
LA Yeah.
SP - right -
LA Which I’ve got some here.
12.53 SP - there’s a £250 over, but I never take it out.
LA Yeah that’s right.
SP So I offset one against the other.
LA That’s only £247 wasn’t it? That was your surplus.
SP Yeah haven't they taken that, I don’t know.
LA But basically your audit shortage was £14,700.
SP I don't, I didn’t, I didn’t, I just wrote the cheque for it.
LA Right OK.
SP I mean they’ probably, I’m not making excuses they

probably did explain it to me and I’ve -

LA Well on the day they’ve asked you the breakdown and
you’ve said you’ve used £5,100 to fill the ATM machine -
13.28 SP Oh I’ve, when they, ‘cos when they came obviously and
they said what's this I said oh it’s, that’s the ATM and then
they said the other I said it’s scratch cards, but whether
they, it’s my fault.

LA Right OK. So if they’re saying you’ve got £5,100 to do with
the ATM but 2,500 of it -
SP That’s the scratch cards.

SP They’re error notices I'd received.
LA Right we're £2,600 adrift then aren't we? If you take off
your 900 then we’re about what, yeah
SP NOT AUDIBLE
LA - with 17, so this NOT AUDIBLE £1700 what's this 1700?
SP No that is, that’s the ATM money that’s what I said I
haven't put it in.
LA So it’s 900 and 1700 on that day?
SP Yeah.
14.14 LA So right.
LC Which is your 2 6.
LA So that’s your 2 6.
SP Sorry I'm getting, yeah.
LA So right OK. So on that, on the Thursday prior to the
balance you've borrowed £2,600 -
SP Yeah.
LA - from the post office to put in the ATM machine?
SP Yeah.
LA OK. When the auditors opened the ATM machine was
there any money in there?
SP I don’t know I didn’t open it. There isn’t any money.
LA There isn’t.
SP They didn’t open it
LA Right.
SP - it, it, it’s, because again it was chewing the notes it’s
empty again

So there was nothing in there. So where was the £2,600
that was supposed to be in the ATM machine, where -
It's been used.

It’s all been used?

Yeah that’s what I said. I don’t know, I didn’t realise how
much has been used.

Right OK. So how did you get paid then? How do you
get the money back then?

It goes into my bank account.

And when does it go in? How soon does it go in?

3 days after, depending on what day. Every night you
have to log it off and then it’s transferred.

Right.

And that’s why then I write, I was gonna write a cheque
once it'd gone through.

Right so basically to fund the machine you can’t actually
write a cheque up 3 days after it’s gone through because
you’d need to take the money out again to keep
replenishing it ‘cos it’s using so much money is that what
you’re saying?

Yeah well see sometime, I don’t just use the post office
and that. If I’ve got a 1,000 in the shop then I'd put my
own money in, well, yeah.

Yeah.

I’m getting confused. Right what happens is, can I start
again?

Yeah go on.

put that in and then it’s used that and we've refilled that -
Right by your own money.

By our own money, when I’ve had the money.

Right.

Then the machine, I can’t think of dates, but like it goes
wrong and it chews the notes and then I’ve had the
engineer out and they’ve looked, or we've sorted it out
ourselves and put it through and just a couple of times I
haven't had the cash on me to refill the machine.

Right.

So stupidly -

Yeah.

- I've because I’m at the post office so I've NOT AUDIBLE
Right and you’ve been doing that for would you say the
last 4 weeks since you've had it installed?

No only for a couple of NOT AUDIBLE. Yeah that’s odds,
that’s odds, you see that’s the odds

That's a scratch card.

Yeah. There’s nothing there. It’s just the last, since I -

money from the post office to put into the ATM machine -

16.59 SP Yeah.
LA - to keep -
SP I didn’t intend to -
LA But how was you gonna pay the money back?
SP Because I write a cheque for it. But I didn’t have a cheque

book that’s what I’m trying to say to you. I'd have just
written a cheque, but obviously now they’ve explained to
me I can’t actually do that.

LA Right yeah.

SP So I realise that, my error there, although I know it sounds
stupid but I just thought if I account -

LA But how would you account, say on the Thurs,
Wednesday when you come to balance how would you
have accounted for that money?

SP Just that’s where we've written it down.

LA Right OK so on your, I’ve got -

SP I counted it as odds. I never put it in with my everyday
cash ‘cos I know it’s not -

LA So like this cash declaration here that I’ve got it was
printed on 4 January -

SP Yeah.

17.39 LA - You've got unusable notes down there, you’ve got 2575.
SP Yeah it says £75.

- that'll be written.

Right OK and then 18 Jan it says 2705 so that’s only £205 -
Yeah.

Yeah? OK. Now on 25 January it goes up, it goes up to
3562.

That’s probably where I’ve put, that’s 25 Jan which is
about a week and a half ago which would include like
where I've -

Right.

- I've used the money and I’ve written the cash dec.
Right yeah OK. So that would account for that then
yeah? So you've got £900 left according to your sheet
you've got 2,500 which you've inflated the cash to
account for the error notices for the scratch cards.

Yeah.

And £900 that you’ve put into the ATM machine.

Yeah.

So that 3, 4 so it’s a £162 that you actually got on hand
for miscellaneous spoilt notes or -

Yeah that, and that it’s all written NOT AUDIBLE

OK and that’s the same, the cash declared that day which
was 25 Jan which was £71,175.42. It’s the same figure
that’s on your final balance NOT AUDIBLE

shouldn't but I’ve always accounted for it. I’ve never just
thought oh I can just take it out and not -

Yeah but what you're doing you're -

I know.

- you're producing something and saying in the post office
is X amount of money where in fact it’s not there.

have you been holding -

SP A few months.

Lc A few months.

SP Yeah.

LC What are we talking about sort of November, October

November time maybe?

SP It might've been before that. What happened was they
sent me loads of error notices over scratch cards that
have, and I’ve got reams of paper that they just sent me
things through and the lady, I’ve tried to ring her and I said
to her I don’t agree with, I can’t make out what is here. I
can’t understand it.

LA Right.

Mmm.

- trying to sort it out and she said they have to go, you
know you have to bring them to account. So, but I’d
never been able to, so I yeah I just put them through and
then I thought I’d be able to sort it out at some point. Not
quite in this way but -

So you was holding them in the hope that something
would come back?

Yeah I mean its’ like with I know it’s a larger amount but
it’s like the £253, like they said to me I could that out
because -

It was surplus for the week.

Yeah. I mean I just never touch it. I know it isn’t mine, I
know that something’s gonna come back somewhere. It’s
like when, that’s what I said, when we had the week
where the whole system went down, it took them a week
to fix it, but they had no online, but they still said that I had
to keep the post office open, I’m still taking in giros. I
couldn’t put them through the system I couldn't do
anything. I was holding a whole week’s, and I kept ringing
them up and saying I’ve got over a 100 odd thousand
here. You know I want it noted that this is what, and
that’s what I said I've never had any back up here.

When was it this happened then do you remember?

That was August and is it Nick Kerr?

Nick Kerr.

He even sent e-mails to whoever, you know, lots of them

way and they just said oh you know you've got to put that
in which obviously I just did. I mean, and I just said surely
these errors will come back.

LA Right.

SP I mean the system went wrong on Saturday. I rang the
helpline straight away. They said they’d get somebody
out Monday. They sent somebody Monday who didn’t
have the right box part

LA Right.

SP He went away and came back with the wrong part and
then they, they even said what do we do, they said just
carry on taking and I said what about Swallows, you know
Swallow Aquatics and all the business men I said I’ve got
no online banking. I can’t do any off reports, I can’t do

anything.
LA Right.
SP So and I had to carry on for a week and then on

Wednesday they finally brought me the right box for the
computer but didn’t bring didn’t bring a printer that was
compatible with it so I couldn’t even do the office balance.
So they made me shut on the Thursday, when he came
with the printer on the Thursday they said they’re not
allowed to carry the ink with the printer. So I was a whole
week and I kept ringing people saying to them you know I
need help here. Somebody’s got a, I’ve got all this
money, I’ve got all these giro’s not going through the

account, everything is a mess and that’s what I said. I
sort of and it might be after and I’ve forgotten where I was
going now rambling on. But that’s what I’m saying here
like that’s what I said, but when the 5, I’m not sure if it’s 5
or £600 there was in error that week. But! kept thinking
well the errors are gonna come back. You know like they
send you an error notice and like with these I thought
they’ve sent me an error but it will come -

You’d think it’d compensating one.

Yes that’s what

But normally error notices are sent to you because you've
made mistakes in previous weeks. Error notices are
normally generated because you've made mistakes.
There about 8 weeks aren’t they behind.

Yeah sounds about right

Something like that yeah.

Yeah so then I’m thinking if that’s what I said like with the
surplus they said well you haven't taken it out, but I said I
know it’s not mine. It’s not my money I know that.

But for that 2,500 had you had 2,500 worth of surpluses in
the sort of months prior to receiving those error notices?
No that’s what I said.

You haven't?

That’s what I said to you I thought, I mean I still have
these NOT AUDIBLE you've got it all in the post office.

like a -

LA A bit up and down are they?

SP They're a little bit, yeah they’re a bit erratic. They’re, but it

seems to like last 3 weeks ago we balanced and all week
I haven't got the figures here, but we were like running a
£100 wrong and I said to Mo look we count all the money
again that we'll unbag all the money that we’ve done up to
rem out and count it all again and then just on the
Wednesday I suppose it could’ve been in the stamps
couldn’t it, but it then comes back are you with me? It’s
sort of like one over takes the other. So like whereas
that’s £250 over and they said to me I should’ve taken
that out to make my balance correct.

LC Yeah that’s what you should do.

SP But I never touch it because I just know that when the
errors come back -

LC Well all you do is you take that money out, put it in a pot
or a bag -

what I’m saying.

SP Like when we get to the instants, Milan who I took over,

he they’re pots, everything was in pots and I used to, well
the first thing I did was did away with the pots to start with
and I got a till we’d be able to lotteries, scratch cards and

NOT AUDIBLE now if we can go onto the scratch cards.
The scratch cards are sold in your private business yeah
the shop?

Yes.

Yeah OK.

Then what I do is -

What happened?

- every few months and then I'd put the money and as I
said to them on Friday nobody’s, I’ve done it before I’ve
got my cheque book with me that shows you where I've
written cheques for like 3,000 of the scratch cards and
then before I took over Milan I think he came in and put
about 9 or 11 and that’s the way it’s always, and I’ve
known any different way to doing that.

So how often, you sell the scratch cards in the shop -
Yeah.

- yeah and how do you get a total of how many scratch
cards you've sold that day?

They’re put on my till. I’ve got -

You’ve got a separate button on your till for the scratch
cards.

Each day

What?

The scratch card money?

It’s in the till. The post office is shut when the post -
Right so that night you take the day’s takings -

I just take it all home.

Right.

NOT AUDIBLE and I never sort it out there I just take it
home with me.

Right OK, so when do you bring that back to the post
office the scratch card money?

Well I just write a cheque and write a cheque for it. We
bank it and then NOT AUDIBLE we put it in our Nat West
account and then I write a cheque for it.

Wouldn't it be simpler just to bring the cash back into the
post office ‘cos that’s where it’s gonna go to be accounted
for in the post office?

Well yeah I know that now. That's what I said I just
followed on doing -

But wouldn’t that seem the simplest way of doing it
anyway? If for argument’s sake at the end of the day -

you?

Yeah.

When Basker went and then his brother in law, no his
Jay’s brother in law took over didn’t he?

I didn’t know that.

Yeah.

Right OK.

He bought it and then obviously I didn’t want to be
associated with Basker and I went to work for Mr J Patel
at Bridgewater Drive

Yeah.

And then he said to me, the one I worked at before was
up for sale did I wanna buy it with him?

Right.

And I didn’t really think that was such a good idea but ‘cos
l'd worked there and I lived like 2 roads away and I’ve
lived there all my life my husband and I decided to buy it
and from the day I said I'll buy it Mr Patel left. And that
was it and run the, and I’ve never and I’m self-taught
through doing that. Andy was there for a while.

Who’s Andy?

I can’t think of his surname, but he was -

He took over temporarily didn’t he?

He was there with Milan and with Basker

SP - ‘cos obviously it was still Milan’s business although I run
it for him, that’s what I’m saying, although I was there for a

while
LA Yeah.
SP - still his business and everything, it was like his, and then

as I say when I had a letter to say I was taking over 10
September, he came down he put all the scratch card
money you know in But it was always the money, the
money was always in a pot, it was in the post office.

LA Right.

SP It was never put, I can, I understand what you're saying,
but that pot so I mean there was no way I was gonna
leave pots of money all over the shop.

LC No, no we wouldn’t expect you to do that.

SP But I, no, I’m, don’t get me wrong I’m not making excuses
I’m just trying to explain.

LA Yeah.

SP You know I know what you’re saying and like since then
Friday, Saturday, Sunday every night I’ve counted the
scratch cards and I’ve left Mo a note with the money which
is the way it’s done.

I do that every time. It’s stupid.

But why do you do that every day, but you don’t do the
scratch cards everyday?

Because we take that home and then we sort that out. It’s
sort of separate. The lottery money right -

So you take the lottery money home as well? The
national lottery money home? The online game you take
that home as well?

No we sort that out there and then I leave that there do
you know what I mean, ‘cos I’ve go the print outs. I get the
two printouts.

Right.

But if you went there today you’d see that Saturdays and
Sundays is sort of left there. That's separate money.
When you get the print out for the online do you also get
the print out for the scratch cards at the same time?
Payout, the payouts, not anything else.

Not the sales?

You only get the scratch card sales when the shop closes
is that what you’re saying?

Yeah.

When does the shop close then?

6 o'clock.

So that’s half an hour after the post office.

Oh yeah, but that’s what I’m saying I could, now I realise
that that’s the way it should be done every night or

night?

It's locked in the post office?

You lock the lottery money in the post office but you don’t
lock the scratch money in the post office?

No ‘cos I don’t sort it out ‘til later, well NOT AUDIBLE
OK so you take the scratch card money home because
it’s part of the shop takings if you like, but you know that
night how many have been sold?

Yes.

But you still don’t take that money back to the post office
the next day to be put through -

I now know that is really bad.

How often do you look at it then?

Well we, my husband does that side of the accounts and
then we put them on our computer and then we add up
and then I put the money in for the scratch cards.

And how often do you put the money in for the scratch
cards?

national lottery instants cards.

Yeah. Saturdays is.

Right because you started off with this figure 8,480 in 23
November and then 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, the following week sorry,
you ordered some more scratch cards in.

That's right yeah.

But why would you need more if you've got that many on
hand to begin with?

I haven't have 1. 1 I’ve sold them.

Well exactly so how many do you actually hold on hand
really at anyone time ‘cos you’re showing nearly 9,000
and you're ordering 1700, but in fact that figure’s probably
quite a lot less.

We hold we've got a full dispenser then I’ve got another
dispenser like full, ready. When they go low then I -

If we say at the audit on hand there’s £755 -

But I already had others there that hadn’t been activated.
Although I’ve loaded them in we don’t activate them until
we use them.

Right. So you have plenty on hand?

I’ve got -

you’ve got on hand?

If they’re activated then I’ve put them on the system.
Right. OK. So the activated ones when the auditors
come in on the first or they come on the 3° -

Yeah.

- but on Wednesday night when you balanced you
showed that you had £10,600 on hand where in fact on
the Friday you only had £755 so basically 9,000 odd
pounds you wouldn't have sold those would you.

So when we do our total we look at that and then I put
that when we’ve added up NOT AUDIBLE we put that in
and the obviously there’s obviously still some outstanding
‘cos we've used them since that period of time.

Right so how often you say you wouldn't put a cheque in -
I wouldn't say I do it regularly no.

No you wouldn't, so when you balance the figures that
you’re showing on your balance -

Are wrong

- they’re all wrong. They’re all inflated because that’s not
actually true figure of what you’ve got on hand.

As I say when if you, if you, I know that’s not -

‘Cos we're not selling them and putting the money in your
bank account effectively the post office money is in your
bank account. That can’t be right.

would you ‘cos it doesn’t go in the bank it’s got to go back
