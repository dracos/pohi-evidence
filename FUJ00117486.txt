Executive Summary

Fujitsu Services are contracted with the Post Office to replace the current infrastructure used in
12000 branches across the UK. The project involves rolling out a (non Oracle) financial application
using Oracle RAC database and tools products. Oracle Streams is used to provide a reporting
database environment

The migration onto the new platform started at the end of 2009 and is currently rolled out live to 600
branches.

Post Offices taking part in the pilot have been complaining about intermittent hangs which are having
huge impact on over the counter services as the system hangs for 5 minutes or longer and users are
unable to complete their financial transactions.

Fujitsu have been unable to reproduce the hangs in any test environment despite numerous attempts
to inject the system with heavy load to simulate the production situation.
The focus of this escalation is to resolve the system wide hangs.

This document outlines the investigations which have been carried out by Oracle support and
development to establish the root cause for these hangs and make recommendations on how to
resolve the issue as per Service Request 3-1610271271.

Root Cause Analysis

The root cause of the hang was a defect in Oracle code that meant the LCK process did not clear the
memory up efficiently,

The application's extensive usage of dal to truncate database partitions has exposed the Oracle
defect . Altering the ddl usage will drastically reduce the chance of the problem occurring. However,
the Oracle defect would have still required resolution longer term.

This usage causes heavy growth of the database's shared memory pool. The hang is caused by Ick
inefficiently attempting to clear down this pool due to excessive growth in the “mvobj part des” region
The root cause of the Ick process's behaviour is an Oracle defect.

Corrective Actions

The two defects (5618049 and 8528171) attribute growth in this region to large amounts of partition
DDL taking place. These have been applied on Thursday 20th May.

Improved shared memory usage after patch application has been observed through analysis of data,
this has shown the average free memory improve and the "mvobj part des” allocations reduced to
750mb compared to 2GB prior to patch application but Ick issue still occurred on Saturday 22” May.

Defect 7306915 resolves a memory leakage issue, this is proved to be occurring in Fujitsu's
environment after analysis by support. This was applied 30" May and initial results are promising but
further monitoring is required

Further application changes required to reduce dal operations are scheduled for the 6" June by
Fujitsu. These are critical and a key action to resolving the critical business impact of this issue as
they will reduce shared memory usage. It is not possible to completely remove all dal operations and
we will be focused on continuing to resolve issues in this area to ensure long term stability of the
service.

Oracle have identified an issue with multi-versioned objects acquiring instance locks and are working
on a fix to free this object in RAC rather than being queued up by LCKO. The current best estimate

FUJ00117486
FUJ00117486

for an official patch for 10.2.0.4.3 and 10.2.0.4.4 is Wed 9" June (end of US time). A revised version

Formatted: Superscript

of the patch for defect 8528171 will be released.

Oracle and Fujitsu are both able to reproduce the issue although not to the full extent of the live
occurrences. This is sufficient to provide Oracle’s Engineering team with a high level of confidence
that the fixes will resolve the service hang issue. However due to the complexity of the environment
Oracle are unable to 100% guarantee that no further issues will occur, based on experience with
hundreds of other customers and the diagnostic information gathered, we believe this is the correct
technical plan to lead to resolution of the current hangs being experienced by the Post Office.

Mitigation

The problem is shown to be related to the time the database instances are running. Regular re-
cycling of the database instances is a proven method to prevent shared memory fragmentation

An alternative approach of flushing shared memory has been recommended to Fujitsu as an
alternative. This is documented in Service Request 3-1610271271.

This recommendation was reviewed and deemed not appropriate due to scheduling
constraints.

Recommendations

By following the actions plan below we believe the issue will be significantly resolved. This is
however, a complex issue and ongoing investigation may lead to other recommendations

SR No: 3-1610271271: Receiver is waiting for a latch dumping latch state for receiver

1. Set _object_statistics=false. This is to enable the fix for defect 6001617 which is a common LCKO
CPUIload fix. Overall LCKO load will be reduced with this parameter setting. (Completed -
14/05/2010)

2. Set event 14532 at level 1 to enable the fix for defect 5618049. This fix frees up "mvobj part des"
heaps faster. (Completed — 20/05/2010)

3. Apply fix for defect 8528171 (provided in patch 9668554). This fix specifically addresses over
allocations of "mvobj part des" heaps and reduces the number of library cache handles that LCKO
would need to free. (Completed - 20/05/2010)

4, Shared poollibrary cache tuning activity, being led by Adrian Turner from Oracle consulting

Aud§$ Table and RA2605.2 Resource Manager)

5. Apply patch for defect 7306915. Delivered to customer on Friday 21st May as merge patch
9734573. This is aimed at further improving shared pool usage after reoccurrence of LCK issue on
22” May... (Completed - 30/05/2010)

This contains the following fixes:-
9668554 (applied 20th May, as discussed in point 3 above) + 7306915 ( fix for 7445
[kalhdgn()+1101] )

6. Until point 4 is complete, Oracle recommend customer continues to regularly recycle database
instances. Based upon current pattern of incidents, a daily recycle would be optimum but depends
upon customer's business requirements

7. Oracle to deliver revised patch for defect 8528171 to free multi version objects. Current ETA is

Wednesday 9 June. -( Formatted: Superscist

Additional Recommendation:

Following the changes outlined above a period of close monitoring is recommended. For other
application related recommendations, see onsite report provided by Adrian Turner.
See attached document below:-

Ste Visit Report
20100514 FINAL (3).

Oracle would also recommend that further investment is made into the Load Testing environment, so
that we can be confident that the architecture will support the additional load of further branches
being rolled out. Oracle have offered to be involved in reviewing the testing strategy in further detail
to ensure adequate load testing is carried out

Use of Oracle Real Application Testing (RAT) should be considered — which combines a workload
capture and replay feature with an SQL performance analyzer to help you test changes against real-
life workloads, and then helps you fine-tune the changes before putting them into production

The database replay feature would require upgrade of the DB to 11g. RAT also includes SQL
Performance Analyser which is available on 10.2 and allows you to analyse the entire SQL workload
for performance degradation in a fraction of the time it would take to do manually

To mitigate the high CPU run queues it is recommended that Fujitsu implement Database Resource
Manager. Resource Manager only steps in when the server is 100% busy and throttles sessions,
making them wait on "RESMGR: CPU QUANTUM" event. Under CPU starvation this will have the
added benefit of preventing the database from impacting Clusterware and operating system
processes. There is a known defect which must be reviewed prior to implementation (Oracle
reference 4147766).

Appendix: Defect descriptions

The following gives technical detail on the underlying defects and what they are designed to fix
Defect 8528171

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
Customer is doing thousands of add/exchange partition operations per day.
These operations cause too much shared pool memory to be allocated

for partition descriptor objects (mvobj part des). Because of this problem,
customer is having several issues on shared pool related operations.

These objects should be cleaned up more quickly when they are no longer
needed

Typically in the AWR report, "mvobj part des" objects are

the largest portion of the shared pool

WORKAROUND:

Restarting instance or flushing shared pool clears up the objects but these workarounds are not
acceptable for the customer. Because they have a 24x7 system and flushing shared pool takes hours
to complete

FIX DESCRIPTION

This problem is addressed as follows:

1) Obsolete and invalid KGL objects are placed on the cold end of the KGH Iru so they are freed
faster.

2) Extent size for partition operations has been increased from 1k to 4k, this decreases
fragmentation
3) Multi-versioned objects now do not acquire any instance locks, obsoletion is instead done
manually in kkpox. This allows for these objects to be freed more quickly in RAC as they can
be freed immediately rather than being queued up by LCKO.

Defect 6001617
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:

LCKO consumes CPU Spining on ksrbwait reading an ever increasing list of messages in "obj stat de!
channel" and holding "channel operations parent latch”. ORA-4031's are also possible as messages
are stored in the shared pool

FIX DESCRIPTION:

This fix is activated by setting STATISTICS_LEVEL = BASIC
(or by setting "_object_statistics"=false) in the init.ora
Setting this means the space advisory will not be available
for use as there will be no statistics for it to measure.

Defect 5618049

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:

Db Leaking memory allocated for "mvobj part description" -- the versioned partition descriptor. It
seems that this happens for both ADD PARTITION and DROP PARTITION (probably for other PMOs
as well), and is not IOT specific.

kgh was unable to free memory because of a latching issue. In this case we had a number of
versioned objects and were unable to free them.

The basic problem is that kgl is sometimes unable to free handles when called from kgh. This
happens when we free one handle, realize this allows us to free a new object (since the ref count is
now zero), but find this new object is protected by a second latch. Since we already hold a latch (to
free the first handle) we are unable to free the second one.

FIX DESCRIPTION:

The fix tries to be proactive about freeing memory and will be enabled under an event 14532. The
10.2 fix tries to free memory proactively.

Defect 7306915
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION

ORA-4031 / KGL HANDLES MEMORY LEAK OF MVOBIND / MVOBTBL FROM PARTITION DDL
Repeated EXCHANGE PARTITION against a partitioned table with local partitioned indexes can
cause a number of obsolete (OBS) unfreeable MVOBIND library cache handles in the library cache.
ie: ALTER SYSTEM FLUSH SHARED POOL will not flush the library cache entries. For high
numbers of exchanges this can lead to shared pool pressure and subsequent ORA-4031 errors.

FIX DESCRIPTION
Merge patch 9668554 has been provided to customer to resolve leaks. Workaround is to reduce the
number of exchange partition operations
