                                                                                     POL001 08851




17. 1 started to run the office from 22 May 2007 and dedicate my all time to
    put the office in shape and proper run. I transfer my kids to sale local
    school, and we the whole family spent our all time to put the office office.

18. Starting from my first balance up to TP 7 every thing was fine.

19. The problem started when I tried to create a stock BB for other cashier. I
    was advised by the help line that only the Crown Office use different stock
    as it could create lots of problems.

20.The purpose of stock BB is to run a separate counter for another cashier
   to keep the check upon staff but it started to create problems showing
   negative stock and surplus cash.

21.0n my TP 8, the balance on stock AA was fine but the balance on stock
   BB was 1, 24.000.00 was gain. I tried to contact help line but could not
   get through. The time was about 9, 45 pm, I tried to resolve the gain
   during an attempt to resolve the horizon asked me to transfer the gain in
   to local suspense which I did.

22. Next day I had a phone call from Chesterfield inquiring the gain, I explain
    to the gentleman what has happened and he advised me that on my next
    balance declare the same amount as loss which I did.

23.                                                          After that I
      stop to use stock BB and phoned to helpline to delete Stock BB they
      advised me that I have to wait at least 5 weeks then I will be able to
      delete so I left as it was.

24.On my TP 10 again my Stock AA was fine and as I try to roll the office
   over the system did not let me do roll over and asked to do the balance
   on stock BB as soon as I balance the stock BB ,it declare 78000.00 lose,
   I transfer the figure in to local suspense and rolled the office over.

25. Again I received a phone call from chesterfield inquiring about the loss

26- 1 explain everything to them. they said there is some error and they will
    send it to upstairs

27. After a day or two I received a phone call from post office ltd saying that it
    is a problem with Stock BB and that 78, 0000 needs to removed, they
    asked me do you know how to do it I said no I just took over the office,
    they said that they will arrange a trainer to clear and delete the stock BB.
                                                                                        POL00108851
                                                                                      POL001 08851




28. After that I had a phone call from help line who explained me how to clear
    that and told me to do through the house keeping and ram out the loss.

29. Next day I received a phone call from a trainer called Marina Slade to
    book a day and time to clear the figure.

30. On 17 January 2008, Marina Slade visited the branch, she checked all my
    cash and some of the stock and find every thing ok, she also checked
    Stock BB the loss was still in there Marina advised me that I have too
    much stock and some of that is obsolete and needs to go back. She told
    me and wrote down every thing on a piece of paper that count every
    single stock , Phone help line to find which stock is obsolete , put them in
    ram bags and get the things ready for my TP balance due on 23 January
    Wednesday

31. She will call again before roll over .it was just co incident that I was in the
    middle of resolving the problem the auditors visited on Monday just a day
    before it all would have been clear and resolved.

32. None of tie matters has been hide or kept in dark and will never be.

34. Since I took over the office has never been run out or requested any
    additional cash some time we were not send the cash remittance and did
    not need the cash.


35. I concentrate only on Post Office and even could not start the shop as I
    have not got extra funds, the funds I had for the shop spent on post office.
   This is the only my living, livelihood and source of income

    in a limited time period with forth coming Christmas and New Year festive
    period definitely was not a perfect working atmosphere and caused a

 k :I

investigation and to support the understanding of the matter.




Before my appointment , we( me & Mrs. )worked very hard along with two little
kids' put every effort from financial arrangements to funds and from application
to selection . It took us hardship sacrifice and dedication.

                                                                                        POL00108851
                                                                                      POL001 08851




HARDSHIP & DIFFICULTIES

After the transfer I came across a number of problems and difficulties such as

Out going sub postmaster who promised to stay and help me to understand the
operation and training disappeared and left me alone in the office.

No disability access
Broken tiles floor/damage floor
Old safe plate and hole in the main entrance
Leaked ceilings
Front door broken
Old safe and rubbish in the office
Lots of obsolete stock
Toilet seat broken
Flush not working
Faulty phone line
Date stamp broken
Rear yard ful l of rubbish and bushes
No legal or public notice of transfer or new management
Empty shop with no fixture and fitting, no business

My trainer was also concerned and called it a bad transfer

I and my Mrs. were left alone to face and handle the situation.


I started to run the office from 22 May 2007 and dedicate my all time to put the
office in shape and proper run. I transfer my kids to sale local school, and we the
whole family spent our all time to put the office office.

starting from my first balance up to TP 7 every thing was fine.

the problem started when I tried to create a stock BB for an other cashier, I was
advised by the help line that only the Crown Office use different stock as it could
create lots of problems.

the purpose of stock BB is to run a separate counter for another cashier to keep
the check upon staff but it started to create problems showing negative stock and
surplus cash.
                                                                                          POL00108851
                                                                                        POL00108851




On my TP 8, the balance on stock AA was fine but the balance on stock BB was
1, 24,000.00 was gain. I tried to contact help line but could not get through. The
time was about 9, 45 pm, I tried to resolve the gain during an attempt to resolve
the horizon asked me to transfer the gain in to local suspense which I did.

Next day I had a phone call from Chesterfield inquiring the gain, I explain to the
gentleman what has happened and he advised me that on my next balance
declare the same amount as loss which I did.

After that I stop to use stock BB and phoned to helpline to delete Stock BB they
advised me that I have to wait at least 5 weeks then I will be able to delete so I
left as it was.

On my TP 10 again my Stock AA was fine and as I try to roll the office over the
system did not let me do roll over and asked to do the balance on stock BB as
soon as I balance the stock BB it declare 78,000.00 lose . I transfer the figure in
to local suspense and rolled the office over.

Again I received a phone call from chesterfield inquiring about the loss
  explain every thing to them, they said there is some error and they will send it
to upstairs

After a day or two I received a phone call from post office ltd saying that it is a
problem with Stock BB and that 78, 0000 needs to removed , they asked me do
you know how to do it I said no I just took over the office, they said that they will
arrange a trainer to clear and delete the stock BB.

After that I had a phone call from help line who explained me how to clear that
and told me to do through the house keeping and ram out the loss.

Next day I received a phone call from a trainer called Marina Slade to book a day
and time to clear the figure.

On 17 January 2008, Marina Slade visited the branch, she checked all my cash
and some of the stock and find every thing ok, she also checked Stock BB the
loss was still in there Marina advised me that I have too much stock and some of
that is obsolete and needs to go back. She told me and wrote down every thing
on a piece of paper that count every single stock , Phone help line to find which
stock is obsolete , put them in ram bags and get the things ready for my TP
balance due on 23 January Wednesday

She will call aga°n before roll over it was just co incident that I was in the middle
of resolving the problem the auditors visited on Monday just a day before it all
would have been clear and resolved.

None of the matters has been hide or kept in dark and will never be.
                                                                                         POL00108851
                                                                                       POL001 08851




During the audit I did explain and acknowledge them the whole situation and was
in understanding that its all nearly dealt with but I have been suspended and
office has been closed. It seems that there has been a miscommunication
between the different departments as I believe a suspension was inappropriate
however the deficiency would have been resolved by Wednesday 23 January
2008 on TP balance and settled centrally. Any out outstanding query or issue
could still be investigated while I could keep the office up and running.




the facts are as I am a family man and me my Mrs. invest all our money and
spend and dedicate all our time and struggle . sacrifice, to built the business and
always committed to provide the service to the community , in last six months the
office has never been closed for any reason not even for lunch. my mother died
last month in my home country, my little boy has been very ill but the office never
closed.

In last six months since I took over the office has never been run out or
requested any additional cash some time we were not send the cash remittance
and did not need the cash.

Even on Monday (audit day) my cash was 12,000.00 pounds over due to a
transaction correction sent on Thursday 17 January 2008. I have never ever
removed any extra or surplus cash.

I concentrate only on Post Office and even could not start the shop as I have not
got extra funds, the funds I had for the shop spent on post office. This is the only
my living, livelihood and source of income




From the day one from application to selection ad from incoming to service we
committed, dedicated, sacrificed, honest, and did my job with the depth of my
heart fair and honesty. this is our only bread and butter keeping our family
survive and living as far as deficiency concerned it's a complex of computer
error insufficient training , human error as no body perfect I don't say I am
perfect but have always been proactive concerned ,vigilant, we are educated
a well to do small family and can never think of any wrong doings, our honesty is
our prestige our character is our pride and will never risk any of that at any cost.
As I have no other means or source of income have a family with little kids to run

Time: 10:30 A.M    12:25

Interviewer: Glenn Chester (Agent Contract Manager)

Interviewee: Azfar Syed

Notes taker: Chris Senior

                               MINUITES OF THE MEETING

Time                        Statement

10:27   I arrived in the building and lead to interview room by Donna

10:42 Glenn Chester accompanied with a colleague entered in the room
      and introduced his colleague as Chris Senior (notes taker) and the
      purpose of interview.

10:45 Glenn Chester read out the statement of Mr Steve Bradshaw based on
      four points

          1) Transfer of cash from stock BB to stock AA
          2) Discrepancy of surplus
          3) Discrepancy of shortage
          4) Financial statement of the total office cash

10:50 I replied to those points as under
      Transfer of cash from stock AA to stock BB, on the advise of help line
      to clear stock BB to delete. I was told I can't delete it until I clear out
      every thing from stock and cash and transfer it to the main stock AA
      and leave the stock BB for five weeks,
                                                 5
                                                                                            POL00108851
                                                                                          POL00108851




       Chris Senior was agreed to the course of action advised by helpline

       and told me it does not delete itself automatically 1 have to do it.

       No response to financial statement as it was prepared by the auditors
       and has not been signed or agreed by me.



       I explained that to keep the record of individual cashier and to make sure
       that if any thing goes wrong in my absence the serving cashier or
       assistant will be responsible for the discrepancies.


11:05 Glenn Chester asked a question did I separate the stock as well.

       I replied no.
       We were using and sharing only stock AA

11:08 Glenn Chester started to look into trading statements and analyse the
      discrepancy, I explained and show him the trial and final balance report
      of the horizon for trading periods TP8, TP9, TP10 which were
       photocopied later by Chris Senior.

11:18 1 also told Glenn Chester that discrepancy over was in local suspense
      and I have a telephone Call from chesterfield who directed to declare the
      amount as loss an next trading Period which I did.

       The discrepancy short was also transfer into local suspense same again
       phone call from chesterfield enquiring about the shortage they told me
       there is some mistake in account they will send it upstairs to senior.

        1 refer the matter to the help line who initially tried to tell me how to clear
        that and then arranged a trainer called Marina Slade.

11:22 Glenn Chester read out the statement of Marina Slade visit.

11:25 1 told Glenn Chester that cash management centre were not receiving

        cash declaration from December because of some problem in my
        system and advised me to call help line which I did.
        All activities were going through proper channel; I did not do any thing
        with out help line, chesterfield and training department from creating the
        stock BB to discrepancy
                                                   6
                                                                                      POL00108851
                                                                                    POL00108851




11:28 Glenn Chester asked me how 1 settled the other previous discrepancies.

       I told make good cash and settled centrally through local suspense.

11:30 Glenn Chester asked me do you take the money out of the safe when it's
       over.

       I replied no 1 always left the money in the safe and never took the money
       out I refer the audit day when there was 9000.00 extra because of the
       transaction correction. I could take that money out but I did not.

11:33 Glenn Chester challenges my answer and said no it does not go through
       the local suspense and local suspense icon does not appear.

11:35 I asked Glenn Chester if the discrepancy is not transferred in to local
        suspense, how come the Helpline, Chesterfield and the Trainer
        communicating to me became aware and got Involved to clear it. I also
        mentioned the phones calls and course of action to take directed by the
        chesterfield staff colleague who phoned me on three occasions

       Glenn Chester replied, I don't know you tell me you are in the spot light.

        I also told Glenn Chester that I tried to find the name of the gentleman
        spoken but was told that they (chesterfield )don't keep or logged the
        calls record).


               • - r    - •          r       • •o       r       -•   r    • •



                        -r -r    r       r   s              •            ••   •


        Glenn Chester stressed that the system showing shortage against stock.

        Again Glenn Chester referred the trading statements

        I asked Glenn Chester does he think is it possible that 78,000 can be
        missing in 6 months time.

        Glenn Chester replied yes, by changing some figures

        I disagreed and represent an example as under:
                                              7
                                                                                       POL00108851
                                                                                     POL00108851




      For example if I receive a remittance of about 78,000 in December and
      when the auditors came they found 73,000 cash physically, in safe the
      total cash comes to 151,000.00, if 78,000 taken away leaving 73,000
      means that I have not serve any customer for a month and the office has
      been closed.

      The Friday cash declaration of denomination figure was matched to cash
      figure in the safe on Monday by the auditor were found correct not
      altered , falsified, or different .

      With an insufficient training and short office term with no friends in post
      office field it is not possible.

      Glenn Chester did not comment or question.




11:45 Glenn Chester asked me do you think some body else lift the money.




11:46 Glenn Chester asked me I was subpostmaster is there any way you can
      pay the money.




       Chris Senior asked me about the lottery money and the method of
       lottery transaction entered in to the hoe izon


11.50 I replied that at the end of the shift the shop assistant handed over the

       lottery sells report and cash to post office assistant over the counter who
       enters the lottery game and scratch cards sell and prize figures in to the
       horizon and cash in to post office drawer every day after closing day
       business.
                                                  8
                                                                                     POL00108851
                                                                                   POL00108851




12:00 Glenn Chester asked have I used the stock BB




         I reply yes

12:02 Glenn Chester asked crystal is on maternity leave,

         I replied no, she was on voluntary training and was not employed.

12:04 Glenn Chester asked why did me not registered Krystal with Post office?

         I replied because she was on voluntary training and making mistakes
         and was Not offered job. I also mentioned that I was in the process of
         recruitment staff Through job centre Wythenshawe and taking
         interviews

12:08 Glenn Chester asked does crystal knew about recruitment

         I replied yes.

12:10 Glenn Chester asked your colleague I think I don't have any more
      question do you want to asked any question he replied no

12:15 1 told Glenn Chester that I have discussed the matter with senior
       subpostmaster Who has about 25 years experience working on horizon
       who told me that there is no way of possibi lity in 7 months time period
       78,000 discrepancy can be generated by falsifying or taken the money
       out

     i                 a     sr     •     a   -•   as   rr   r        t•



         Chester asked me to name those subpostmaster, whether they from
         federation.

         1 replied no they are retired.

 12:25 Finally Glenn Chester told me as enquiries are still going on , and after
       today I will be making my own enquires., that's why I gave you an
       opportunity to tell me every thing .


                                                   0
                                                                                     POL00108851
                                                                                   POLOO1 08851




 The interview ended my closing words saying that I have told you every

 thing truth, I am a family man, I have two little kids one 2 years and other

 5 years old, I also show you my mortgage and financial commitments,
 and the told Glenn Chester about my Mrs workingt               GRo




                                                                           --
 and  my mother's   death where  I could not see her  or attended her funeral,
 but did not close the office and leave the office to any body else showing
 how much I am responsible, dedicated, sacrifice
 and care about the office.

 I also told Glenn Chester how much I care or precaution about the
 customer's money that I use to call old people with large transaction, I
 always took in side the office to count and handed over the money to
 them and advised them to keep the money safe and lead to the door
 making sure they don't get robbed outside the shop by gang of youths
 hanging outside the shop.

 I also said that that money is nothing it could be here and tomorrow there
 but my character is everything I don't want to loose my character for some
 thing I have not done

 Finally Glenn Chester said me if you have told me the truth and nothing
 wrong come to light otherwise I will charge you.

 I told Glenn Chester be assured I have not done any thing and I will never
 ever do anything wrong, it is a paperwork remittance scanned mistake but
 nothing else. I worked very hard to get the office and will not risk my
 character at any cost , my kids my future and you interviewed me you
 appointed me I will never breach your trust , and never ever put you in
 such position. If I made such mistake I would have come to you and told
 you and ask for the help. l also offer Glenn Chester to interview my Mrs
 individually she is a shy , honest decent lady will tell you straight away if I
 would have done any thing wrong.

  I told Glenn Chester that I wanted to take oath or swear on my
--- ' --GRO    ;but I did not request for as it will make you think that
  I am guilty.

 I asked Glenn Chester that how long it will take to resolve and was told
 normally 3 months but due to the complexity it will be more in this case,
 Glenn Chester thanked me for coming and lead me to exit saying will
 contact me shortly after further enquires.

A trainer called Marina Slade visited the branch on Friday 17 January 2008 and
checked my cash in safe ,balance snap shot and confirmed that every thing is ok
she also checked the balance snap shot of stock BB. She wrote down what to
on a piece of paper. My TP 10 roll over was due on Wednesday 23 January 2008
She also said she will be back in 2 days and sort the problem on TP roll over.

The chesterfield , helpline were aware and helping me to clear local suspense.

After first deficiency over the stock BB was stop to use,

I contacted helpline who advised me to transfer the all the cash stock to main
stock AA and leave the stock BB for 5 or 6 weeks then I can delete it.
r




The situation, the circumstances , the evidence suggest that in the light of the
facts surrounding the action taken does not recommend or justify their action

As far as the deficiency or shortage concerned it is very unrealistic can not be
accommodate or falls in to any jurisdiction or contrary to any act of regulatory
compliance or contract for services.

It is only a paper work , remittance , transaction entry, double declaration or a
computer mistake / error but certainly no falsification or cash lift.




The material of this document is true at the best of my knowledge.

Further to our telephone conversation on Friday, I managed to find some of the
daily transaction work, enclosed are the documents requested and I am pleased
to refer highlighted SU AA and SU BB, figures which very clearly indicates the
error office deficiency.

As in my various letters and telephone calls I have expressed my serious
concerns over the suspension and office closure in my previous correspondence.

Despite my over all circumstances and situation pictured, describe in my
previous letters its now 3 week, nothing seems to be done and the office is still
closed. I am trying my all utmost efforts to bring the business back to normal.

Me and my family is extremely concerned over the suspension and the office
closure, as before the auditors visit under the activity carried on ti the related
department from Helpline to chesterfield and the proper channel to delete and to
clear the SU BB the suspension was not permitted.

Even on audit dayL. before Janet Holding start the audit I told and explain about
problem and the deficiency to be resolved and clear I also handed over the sheet
of action and procedure of removal and to resolve the issue qLynJrne b y
trainer Marina Slade who was due to come back after 2 days on my TP balance
day on 23 January 2005.

Under the situation and on going procedure of removal and to resolve the
deficiency my suspension was undue, inappropriate and unjustified.
                                                                                         POL00108851

It's nearly over 3 weeks and as I have already acknowledged my mental financial
and physical condition of stress, strain and financial pressure and difficulty. More
over all other available options has also been declined. Now time to time as the
matter is prolonging it's getting bad.

I request you to look in to the matter as urgency and reinstate me please, in the
interest of the Post Office Ltd ,the community service and of course for my living
and livelihood. I have done my best to assist you as I have arrange an interview
with your investigating team I will also assist and supplement the clarification of
the matter to them.

However if you still need any further assistance please do not hesitate to contact
me.

                      period

IN THE LIGHT OF THE ABOVE FACTS, IT IS VERY OBVIOUS AND CLEAR THAT THERE HAS

BEEN NO DEFICIENCY OR CASH SHORTAGE, THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND SITUATION DOES

NOT DIRECT       A SUSPENSION.



A VERY APPROPRIATE AND RIGHT COURES OF ACTION AND CODE OF PRACTICE WERE

EXCERCIED.
                                                                                       POL00108851

I AM SURE AND BELIEVE     THAT IN REALLITY THERE IS NO DEFICINCY AN ERROR

OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF WRONG ENTRY , OR COMPUTER ERROR , BOTH AMOUNTS

OF DISCREPENCIES DOES NOT FIT OR ACCOMMODATE ANY WHERE IN THE WHOLE

TRADING PERIODS OR ANY TRASACTION,



LOOKING IN TO THE WHOLE MATTER, THE INVOLVEMENTS OF THE DEPARTMENTS

IDENTIFYING THE ERROR AND THEIR EFFORTS TO PROCESS            REMEDY, AN EIGHT

MONTHS BUSINESS ACTIVITY OF SUCH A SMALL OFFICE     NEITHER REQUIRED A LENTHY

 This summary is very brief and based on 11 main point of the issue and is the heart

 Investigation.



     1)   The investigation manager Mr Steve Bradshaw confirmed that there were no problems for

          the TI' 2, 3, 4, 5. 6, 7, and absolutely fine.
                                                                                                  POL00108851
                                                                                                POL001 08851




2)   Mr Bradshaw was sure and confirmed that cash holding for the sale circle branch can

     never be 100,000.00 or over.



3)   Mr Bradshaw questioned me over a multitransfer of first discrepancy over 126,000.00 from

     AA to BR and BB to AA. his analyses suggest that the office balance was fine and there

     were no discrepancy , a multi transfer is not beneficial , so why such transfer were

     performed , my response to that question was same as his and replied that why I should

     I have not done it every action has been done on advice of telephone helpline.



4) Mr Bradshaw was told that all there was only two consecutive discrepancy

     Discrepancy over 126,000.00

     Discrepancy short 78,000.00

     The course of action to clear and resolve was advise and directed by the

     Chesterfield and helpline.




      Because the discrepancy were not exist physically , no cash was over or

      short so both were left unresolved transfer into local suspense I represent

      the training book branch trading transition and refer page 26 of the book

      to verify and support the action.



      since then chesterfield, helpline and trainer were notified and involved to

     clear the discrepancy error and the process was arrange by the training

     department underway to clear the discrepancy by the TP roll over due on

      23`1 January 2008

     and Steve makes odd mistakes. I said everybody makes mistake, I am not

     perfect.

6) After a detailed dialogue and analyses of some documents prepared by Mr

      Steve. The discrepancy was found quite      unrealistic, and absolutely un

      Natural and un accommodate unclassified.




r)    During the interview Mr Bradshaw stressed, shouted and tried to put the words in to my

      mouth that 'I stole the money, that was very offensive and un acceptable but I replied and

      rejected his attempt to make me take the words and answer no never.




 8)   Mr Bradshaw remarks (tape recorded)        to create a separate stock BB was as to defraud

As its nearly over 2 months , since suspension I have been constantly in touch       explain , and

assist you honestly and truthfully and have provided you a very high level of written information

trustworthy any more than that.




As I have already said repeatedly and reiterate again and again from the day one of the problem

raised that the discrepancy shortage is a genuine paper work mistake, remittances, computer error

or a human error by staff.



Under the circumstance where an error or mistake has been identified previously by

appropriate department who were aware and involved to rectify it, why a suspension was

directed , and remuneration was ceased even after the suspension the evidence, enquiries,

investigation has failed to support the discrepancy, under the light of the office cash

remittances history, cash in safe , office cash holding history, office pay out history and over

all performance, regular communication with the related dept such as helpline , training,

chesterfield   does not permit a physical cash shortage and falls in to a paperwork, a

declaration, key entry mistake and error.




 Theoretically it's not applicable to falsify or alter such a big number by transferring just one

figure from one stock to another stock in just no of hours with in a very short intervals of time,

a mistake or erroe takes a second or a minute to happen or exist but a falsifications or

           I will be very thankful and grateful to you, if I can have an appointment to see you, your few

           to seeking a fair, justified, impartial consideration of the decision.

Failure to make good losses without delay and falsification of office account.



On 19 December 2008 the cash declared was 126507.55



On 19 December 2008 the final balance was      126507.55



EVIDENCE B ENCLOSED



On 24'" Nov 2007 an unexplained discrepancy error over 126000 occurred,



On 251h Nov 2007 a telephone call was made to chesterfield and notified the problem of another

stock BB showing 126, 0000 over on 24th Nov 2007



An advice was directed to declare a loss of 126,000 on next TP 8 by chesterfield.



EVIDENCE C ENCLOSED



On 19" December 2007 a stock BB which has not done any transaction showed a discrepancy

error shortage of 78,000.



On 20 December the stock BB was stopped to use completely.



On 215` December a telephone call was also made to helpline to delete stock BB because of the

problem.



Training department and help line were involved to look in to resolve.



As both discrepancies were not genuine and physically not there, I did not settle them and

transferred in to local suspense for further advice on what and how to do.
                                                                                                        POL00108851
                                                                                                      POL001 08851




All necessary and appropriate course of action were I placed.



As you said in your letter dated 19`" April 2008 that the discrepancy was settled cash and if I

settled them as good cash how come the departments were aware of local suspense figures,

identified the problem and involved and made arrangements to clear it.



The representative from the chesterfield department mislead and misguide me advising a wrong and

inappropriate course of action as to declare the loss on next TPB, If he would advised me to settle

centrally, the issue of discrepancy should have not been born and same on second time 78,000

under, should have been settled centrally the branch will still be over in cash.



On 23 December the problem was notified to helpline who arranged a trainer to clear and was

engage in the process of clarification.



On 21s' January 2008,befor the audit starts, the auditor Janet Holding was acknowledge and

notified of the discrepancy and the aalsction being under process , jennet holding made the phone

calls to trainer Marina Slade and helpline training supervisor who confirmed the problem with stock

BB but no losses or falsification.



As you mentioned in the charge an unexplained, of course it is unexplained because actually there

is no deficiency and comparing the office financial holdings, capacity, mathematical statistics and

customer's financial services it is not possible.



SO NO LOSSES WERE FOUND OR REPORTED



During the office term especially between Oct 2007, November 2007 and December 2007, no

extra cash was requested, no cash shortage was reported, all the cash figures and remittance were

monitored and arranged by cash management team,

No queries and question was raise or received.

The cash figure declared were spot checked by trainer Marina Slade on 17th January 2008 and the

cash figure declared on 19`" January checked by auditors on Monday 21      were fcund accurate no

falsified or altered.

I always said to you that my character Is every thing , I have lived with pride and prestige and I

have invested the last penny of my family money, not only money but the time , effort , devotion

,care , sacrifice, honesty, risks, and not had any reward or reap from the business yet.



We live in an imperfect world and makes mistakes, the pilot crashes planes, the computers

crashes, the trains collides, people killed in accident, the buildings collapses, the high security fails.



 During our telephone conversation I also told you that I have a complete faith and trust in you and

wants to resolve the issue by harmony, mutual understanding and negotiation rather aggressions.



Though I have got an insurance policy for legal expenses but I do not intend to make the issue

bitter, controversial by passing it to the solicitor to start legal battle and war.



Although I am not under obligation or principally and legally not supposes to offer you any

reimbursement for an unexplained, unproved and non existed discrepancy or money which has

never been remit or taken away however just to show my decency and in an attempt to save

my character and prestige in the best interest of both parties and as a gesture of good will:-



As you have already taken 10,000 , which was my money, in addition to that amount I am

willing to pay another half of the deficiency 33,000 in instalment deducted each month from my

salary provided I get reinstate immediately. I will assume that that I have bought the office very

expensive.
