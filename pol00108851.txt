school, and we the whole family spent our all time to put the office office.

18. Starting from my first balance up to TP 7 every thing was fine.

19. The probiem started when | tried to create a stock BB for other cashier. |
was advised by the help line that only the Crown Office use different stock |
as it could create lots of problems. 1

20. The purpose of stock BB is to run a separate counter for another cashier
to keep the check upon staff but it started to create problems showing
negative stock and surplus cash.

21.On my TP 8, the balance on stock AA was fine but the balance on stock
BB was 1, 24.000.00 was gain. | tried to contact help line but could not
get through. The time was about 9, 45 pm, | tried to resolve the gain

to local suspense which | did.

22.Next day | had a phone call from Chesterfield inquiring the gain, | explain i
to the gentleman what has happened and he advised me that on my next i
balance declare the same amount as loss which | did.

23. After that |
stop to use stock BB and phoned to helpline to delete Stock BB they
advised me that | have to wait at least 5 weeks then | will be able to
delete so | left as it was.

24.On my TP 10 again my Stock AA was fine and as | try to roll the office
over the system did not let me do roll over and asked to do the balance
on stock BB as soon as | balance the stock BB , it declare 78,000.00 lose .
| transfer the figure in to local suspense and rolled the office over.

25. Again | received a phone call from chesterfield inquiring about the loss

POL00108851
POL00108851

28. After that | had a phone call from help line who explained me how to clear
that and told me to do through the house keeping and ram out the loss.

29.Next day | received a phone call from a trainer called Marina Slade to
book a day and time to clear the figure. |

30.On 17 January 2008, Marina Slade visited the branch, she checked all my
cash and some of the stock and find every thing ok, she also checked
Stock BB the loss was still in there Marina advised me that | have too
much stock and some of that is obsolete and needs to go back. She told
me and wrote down every thing on a piece of paper that count every |
single stock , Phone help line to find which stock is obsolete , put them in
tam bags and get the things ready for my TP balance due on 23 January

. She will call again before roll over .it was just co incident that | was in the
middle of resolving the problem the auditors visited on Monday just a day
before it all would have been clear and resolved.

32. None of the matters has been hide or kept in dark and will never be. |

33. During the audit | did explain and acknowledge them the whole situation
and was in understanding that its all nearly dealt with .but | have been
suspended and office has been closed. It seems that there has been a
miscommunication between the different departments as | believe a
suspension was inappropriate however the deficiency would have been
resolved by Wednesday 23 January 2008 on TP balance and settled
centrally. Any out outstanding query or issue could still be investigated
while | could keep the office up and running.

34. Since | took over the office has never been run out or requested any
additional cash some time we were not send the cash remittance and did
not need the cash. |

35.1 concentrate only on Post Office and even could not start the shop as |
have not got extra funds, the funds | had for the shop spent on post office.
This is the only my living, livelihood and source of income

36.From the day one from application to selection ad from incoming to
service we committed, dedicated, sacrificed, honest, and did my job with
the depth of my heart, fair and honesty. this is our only bread and butter
keeping our family survive and living as far as deficiency concerned ,it's;a
complex of computer error insufficient training , human error as no body
perfect

37. Being a new sub postmaster with no previous experience, limited training
in a limited time period with forth coming Christmas and New Year festive
period definitely was not a perfect working atmosphere and caused a
complex error.

Enquiry

Suspect Aztar SYED
Offender

Solicitor

* Audit in January 2008 revealed a shortage of £69,932.04

* At the audit Mr SYED had understated his cash by £10,000+

* Ona balance snapshot there was a discrepancy in excess of
£80,000 ~ the shortage of £69,000 is arrived at by the
understated cash and he was due a correction notice of approx.
£2500.

* Mr SYED became sub postmaster in May 2007.

* Mr SYED could not explain if he physically counted the cash in
the Post Office how he did not discover the shortage in the cash.

« Mr SYED said that he used one stock unit (AA) and the others used
stock unit BB. He then said that they served out of one stock
unit but used the cash in another. If this was the case then
there would be a surplus of cash in one stock unit and a
corresponding shortage in the other. Mr SYED could not explain
why this did not occur.

* During one trading period Mr SYED declared that he had in excess
of £200,000 in cash at the post office but during the interview
he said that he had never declared this amount nor had he ever
had this amount in the Post Office.

RESTRICTED

FOR CICA X/09/223970-2A,

. eee said that he had little training and did not know how to
october 2007 ve from one stock unit to the other. However on 24
2 @ made a number of transfer’s between stock units
in 8 mintues.

* Mr SYED said that he did not trust the clerk who worked for him.

¢ Mr Syed could offer no explanation to why large amounts of cash
were continually transferred between AA and BB stock units.

* Mr Syed stated that he did not receive sufficient training.

* Mr Syed admitted that he shared his password.

* Mr Syed incorrectly created an additional stock unit, which has
gone someway to causing these problems.

* Mx Syed states that everything he has done has been on the advice
of the helpline.

* Mr Syed maintains that these discrepancies are the result of
errors.

Mr Syed was the person responsible for completing the Branch Trading
Statement balance and the possibility existed of a prima facia case
for false accounting being established against him. However when all
circumstances of this enquiry are considered at this present time,

the evidence was not sufficient to ensure a realistic prospect of a

successful prosecution.

Mr SYED currently still owes the Post Office in excess of £100,000
(the shortage plus interest) and Post Office Ltd are in the process

of taking CCJ out against him.

17/7/2008 - debarred from working at the Post Office

directed by them.

Glenn Chester replied | don’t know you tell me you are in the spot light.

Glenn Chester stressed that the system showing shortage against stock. |
Again Glenn Chester referred the trading statements

tasked Glenn Chester does he think is it possible that 78,000 can be
missing in 6 months time.

Glenn Chester replied yes, by changing some figures

| disagreed and represent an example as under:
7
POL00108851
POL00108851

For example if | receive a remittance of about 78,000 in December and
when the auditors came they found 73,000 cash physically, in safe the
total cash comes to 151,000.00, if 78,000 taken away leaving 73,000 }
means that | have not serve any customer for a month and the office has
been closed.

The Friday cash declaration of denomination figure was matched to cash
figure in the safe on Monday by the auditor were found correct not
altered , falsified, or different .

With an insufficient training and short office term with no friends in post i
office field it is not possible.

Glenn Chester did not comment or question.

1 was so upset and emotional that my eyes burst into tears I did not
know what | was saying because the words were not coming from
my mind but from the depth of my heart and that was the pure truth

41:45 Glenn Chester asked me do you think some body else lift the money.

| replied, | don't think so. it's such a big amount, if it's two or three
hundred or thousand it could be possible but not 78.000.00.

11:46 Glenn Chester asked me | was subpostmaster is there any way you can
pay the money.

\ replied , | have got no money and offer you to enquire my bank account
| also told you that my shop is empty because | have not got any extra

money for the stock and show you the mortgage and security documents
to enable you to understand my financial situation and condition. |

Chris Senior asked me about the lottery money and the method of
lottery transaction entered in to the horizon

11:50 | replied that at the end of the shift the shop assistant handed over the

lottery selis report and cash to post office assistant over the counter who
enters the lottery game and scratch cards sell and prize figures in to the
horizon and cash in to post office drawer every day after closing day

business.

but my character is everything | don’t want to loose my character for some
thing | have not done

nothing else. | worked very hard to get the office and will not risk my
character at any cost , my kids my future and you interviewed me ,you

| told Glenn Chester that | wanted to take oath or swear on my
‘but | did not request for as it will make you think that

guilty.

| asked Glenn Chester that how long it will take to resolve and was told
normally 3 months but due to the complexity it will be more in this case,
Glenn Chester thanked me for coming and lead me to exit saying will
contact me shortly after further enquires.

POL00108851

In the 29 week of January | received a telephone call from cash management
centre telling there is some obsolete stock or cash figure in the system and
because of that they are not receiving daily cash declarations from 23rd
December 2007.

| contacted the help line and explain the problem.

They initially asked , tried to tell me how to do it and then decided to arrange a |
trainer to clear obsolete stock ,cash and local suspense.

A trainer called Marina Slade visited the branch on Friday 17 January 2008 and
checked my cash in safe ,balance snap shot and confirmed that every thing is ok
she also checked the balance snap shot of stock BB. She wrote down what to
on a piece of paper. My TP 10 roll over was due on Wednesday 23 January 2008
She also said she will be back in 2 days and sort the problem on TP roll over.

The chesterfield , helpline were aware and helping me to clear local suspense.
After first deficiency over the stock BB was stop to use,

| contacted helpline who advised me to transfer the all the cash ,stock to main
stock AA and leave the stock BB for 5 or 6 weeks then | can delete it.

While the departments were in the middle of process to resolve the problem , the
auditors named Jennet Holding and Mr Jeff turn out , they were told and
explained about the problem,

Personally Jennet Holding made phone calls to the people and the department | |
told were processing clearance they confirmed the problem and action taken
but she did not listen, called Julie Pollard (BDM) and refer the suspension to Mr
Paul William.

| was shocked and surprised over the suspension.

The situation, the circumstances , the evidence suggest that in the light of the
facts surrounding the action taken does not recommend or justify their action .

As far as the deficiency or shortage concerned it is very unrealistic can not be

accommodate or falls in to any jurisdiction or contrary to any act of regulatory
compliance or contract for services.

It is only a paper work , remittance , transaction entry, double declaration or a
computer mistake / error but certainly no falsification or cash lift.

The record of interview and the minuets of the meeting documents has
been prepared with extreme care and saturated details of interview with out
concealment of material facts.

Dear Glenn

Further to our telephone conversation on Friday, | managed to find some of the
daily transaction work, enclosed are the documents requested and | am pleased
to refer highlighted SU AA and SU BB, figures which very clearly indicates the
error office deficiency.

As in my various letters and telephone calls | have expressed my serious
concerns over the suspension and office closure in my previous correspondence. |

Despite my over all circumstances and situation pictured, describe in my
previous letters its now 3 week, nothing seems to be done and the office is still
closed. | am trying my all utmost efforts to bring the business back to normal.

Me_and my family is extremely concerned over the suspension and the office
closure, as before the auditors visit , under the activity carried on by the related
department from Helpline to chesterfield and the proper channel to delete and_to
clear the SU BB the suspension was not permitted.

Even on audit day, before Janet Holding start the audit | told and explain about |
problem and the deficiency to be resolved and clear | also handed over the sheet
of action and procedure of removal and to resolve the issue given to me by i
trainer Marina Slade who was due to come back after 2 days on my TP balance j
day on 23 January 2008.

Under the situation and on going procedure of removal and to resolve the
deficiency my suspension was undue, inappropriate and unjustified.

Respected Dear Allan Cook

| refer above and would like to draw your attention towards the above subject May | take an

opportunity to launch an official complaint to approach you to seek Help, Justice as | have a strong

faith and believe in your judgement and British Justice.

Please let me introduce myself first, my name is Azfar Syed | was Sub postmaster of the above

branch during from 5" may 2007 -21" January 2008.

We (Mr & Mrs) were running the branch successfully and devoted our money time, hard work and
supplement efforts, sacrificed to improve the branch presentation and post office services and

business.

A discrepancy error was erupted on 19” December 2007, reported, assessed identified and was

under rectification process by the appropriate departments of the Post Office Ltd.

The chesterfield was aware of the error and the course of actions directed by the chesterfield and

help line were act upon to clear it.

Head of the help tine arranged a trainer to visit the office to clear the error, the trainer came and
checked the office cash and paper work found absolutely spot on, balanced and confirmed the

error.
An audit was performed by the auditors on 21" of January 2008, the auditors were satisfied of the
cash present on the premises and were aware of the discrepancy in advanced before the audit, no

breach of contract or compliance were found or reported in the report.

But Mr Paul Williams incorporate an unfair, unlawful, wrong exercise and confirmed the suspension

and passed the matter to Mr Glenn Chester.

Mr Glenn Chester since then dealt and carried out an extensive and lengthy process of
assessment, analysis, interviews activity, investigations, premises search but failed to find a single
piece of evidence of any thing wrong doings either professional, criminal contractual fault or breach
of contract or cash shortage or discrepancy there were no negative revelations , but carried out
unfair, unjustified, unlawful practice and exercised taking pecuniary advantage of his position and

did not reinstate me.

| have received a letter from HRSC farnwoth confirming that nothing has been revealed that could

prevent me working in the office.

From the day one of the suspension | maintained the statement of affairs and submit multiple

documents of explanation of error,

Request were put through to reinstate me or install Novera Syed (branch Manager) as temporarily
sub postmistress who is working in the branch since last

48 months and to keep carry on enquiry till conclusion.

A suspension or termination could be directed on completion and findings of the enquiries and

investigation.

But Mr Glen Chester and Deviyn Cumberland did not respond to request and letters and closed the
office causing inconvenience to the community and customer and financial and business losses to

the branch.

POL00108851
POL00108851

A number of illegal acts, unlawful code of practices have been exercised, false accusation by two of

the contracts manager Paul Williams and Glenn Chester.

| have been a victim of unlawful suspension, illegal, constructive dismissal professional misconduct
discrimination, my living, bread and butter has taken away and the whole family has been put

through a nightmare , suffers ,pain and struggle.

The Branch Manager Mrs Novera Syed has also been subject to contravention of equal opportunity,
branch transfer, discrimination and unlawful blockade obstacles and resistance to her appointment

as interim or permanent sub postmistress of the branch

The whole issue is subject to its legality ,its validity , handling and resolution,

| would be very pleased if | can have few minuets of your precious time with an appointment to see
you and handed over the necessary documents and case file
for your kind anticipation and consideration to get justice, | think very high of you and you are my

only hope.

| have got a family with two little kids to provide, Me my Mrs worked very hard to make living , we
both have done a lot for this office and saved the Post office property and cash on two occasions

from the armed robberies.

What we have been put through it Is very hard to express in words, mentally financially, they have

ruined our lives.

Unlawful suspension, inappropriate course of action, wrong exercise of power and code of practice,
closure of the office, discrimination, caused a disaster financial, custom loss and was not in the

interest of the Post Office Ltd.

POL00108851

As its nearly over 2 months , since suspension | have been constantly in touch explain , and

assist you honestly and truthfully and have provided you a very high level of written information ,

interview , investigation assistance ,house search and can not be honest , fair , Justified ,

trustworthy any more than that.

As | have already said repeatedly and reiterate again and again from the day one of the problem

raised that the discrepancy shortage is a genuine paper work mistake, remittances, computer error

or a human error by staff.

Under the circumstance where an error or mistake has been identified previously by
appropriate department who were aware and involved to rectify it, why a suspension was
directed , and remuneration was ceased even after the suspension the evidence, enquiries,
investigation has failed to support the discrepancy, under the light of the office cash
remittances history , cash in safe , office cash holding history , office pay out history and over
all performance, regular communication with the related dept such as helpline , training,
chesterfield does not permit a physical cash shortage and falls in to a paperwork, 4

declaration, key entry mistake and error.

Theoretically it's not applicable to falsify or alter such a big number by transferring just one
figure from one stock to another stock in just no of hours with in a very short intervals of time,

a mistake or error takes a second or a minute to happen or exist but a falsifications or

alteration of numbers takes years time and practically a Cabin trolley or suite case required to

lift or to take such amount of money out.

More over the 78,000.00 is two weeks remittance and removing and taking that amount of cash

means the branch will have an empty safe and will not permit any pay outs and customer service.

The matter of this document has been prepared with extreme care and has been consulted with

legal and general bodies.

The high profile document will only be sent to the authority as named in this documents who will

look in to the matter and proceed as determined by them.

SUMMERY OF THE GROUNDS AND CHARGES: i

Failure to make good losses without delay and falsification of office account

Failure to maintain a standard of security sufficient to ensure the safe custody of cash and

stock of all kinds and other post office Itd property.

Failing to register a sub office assistant with Post Office Ltd

Failure to comply with operational instructions governing the correct use of horizon passwords

| am very surprised and astonished reading the grounds and the charges brought forward that has

neither raised or been brought in to the case during all enquires and interviews from the day one

21" January 2008 to up to now.

On Monday 21“ January the auditors started the audit 9.00 am and finished 8.00 pm (11 Hours)

but did not briefed me any thing exactly why | have been suspended, no concern or issue was

questioned, no copy of the audit /survey report or any kind of paper work was signed or handed

over to me or left at the premises.

POL00108851
POL00108851

The letter issued_on 24% January 2008 by Paul William (Agent Contract Manager) confirmed

the suspension precautionary and did not identify the auditor's findings or any other

contraventions. |

EVIDENCE A ENCLOSED

As | am already under an enormous stress, being ill health and financial and living struggle, it is

very upsetting, disappointed and under impression that as nothing has been found in three months

enquiry to summarised the termination. |

| was shocked and concerned, | phoned you on two occasions Thursday and Friday just to discuss

the summery charges of termination and my view and intentions for the future course of action.

Based on the whole matter careful assessments of the history of the facts, events and chain of the
course of direction from the chesterfield, helpline, trainer involvement, interview, audit, investigation
and three months enquiry it is evident that the matter was already in the hands of the appropriate
department and arrangements were made to resolve and clear unexplained , deficiency was due to
be completed on TPO on 23” January 2008 , the auditors were confirmed over the phone by
training department head and trainer herself, therefore a suspension was undue, unfair , illegal and

should have not been directed.

| disagree, and reject the claim of the charges completely as | believe the evidence does not

support the charges.

My version and evidence for rejection as detailed under.

GROUND1
POL00108851
POL00108851

|

Failure to make good losses without delay and falsification of office account.

On 19 December 2008 the cash declared was 126507.55

On 19 December 2008 the final balance was 126507.55

EVIDENCE B ENCLOSED

On 24" Nov 2007 an unexplained discrepancy error over 126000 occurred.

On 25" Nov 2007 a telephone call was made to chesterfield and notified the problem of another

stock BB showing 126, 0000 over on 24” Nov 2007

An advice was directed to declare a loss of 126,000 on next TP 8 by chesterfield.

EVIDENCE C ENCLOSED

On 19" December 2007 a stock BB which has not done any transaction showed a discrepancy

error shortage of 78,000.

On 20 December the stock BB was stopped to use completely.

On 21* December a telephone call was also made to helpline to delete stock BB because of the

problem.

Training department and help line were involved to look in to resolve.

As both discrepancies were not genuine and physically not there, | did not settle them and

transferred in to local suspense for further advice on what and how to do.

All necessary and appropriate course of action were t placed.

As you said in your letter dated 19" April 2008 that the discrepancy was settled cash and if |
settled them as good cash how come the departments were aware of local suspense figures,

identified the problem and involved and made arrangements to clear it.

The representative from the chesterfield department mislead and misguide me advising a wrong and
inappropriate course of action as to declare the loss on next TP8, If he would advised me to settle
centrally, the issue of discrepancy should have not been born and same on second time 78,000

under, should have been settled centrally the branch will still be over in cash.

On 23 December the problem was notified to helpline who arranged a trainer to clear and was

engage in the process of clarification.

On 2i" January 2008,befor the audit starts, the auditor Janet Holding was acknowledge and
notified of the discrepancy and the aalsction being under process , jennet holding made the phone
calls to trainer Marina Slade and helpline training supervisor who confirmed the problem with stock

BB but no losses or falsification.

As you mentioned in the charge an unexplained, of course it is unexplained because actually there
is no deficiency and comparing the office financial holdings, capacity, mathematical statistics and

customer's financial services it is not possible.

SO NO LOSSES WERE FOUND OR REPORTED

During the office term especially between Oct 2007, November 2007 and December 2007, no
extra cash was requested, no cash shortage was reported, all the cash figures and remittance were
monitored and arranged by cash management team.

No queries and question was raise or received.

POL00108851
POL00108851

POL00108851
POL00108851

The cash figure declared were spot checked by trainer Marina Slade on 17" January 2008 and the
cash figure declared on 19" January checked by auditors on Monday 21" were found accurate no

falsified or altered.

SO NO FALSIFICATION WAS FOUND OR REPORTED.

GROUND 2

Failure to maintain a standard of security sufficient to ensure the safe custody of cash and

stock of all kinds and other post office Itd property:

Under this ground the statement you provided does not exist , | have got the copy of auditors report

sent by chesterfield to me , in that report it is confirmed that no compliance or regulatory test or

checks were performed and no such concerns or question or remarks were noted down or

commented. |

The cash was well secured and kept in the solid metal drawers which were locked _,located

under the 3“ counter which is not in use and out of sight and reach and not accessible and was

due be sent back on Monday.

Legally and ideally a copy of the auditor’s report or site survey documents must be signed by

the sub postmaster and a copy of the forms or related paper work or activity report should have

been handed over at the end of completion of audit.

As far as standard of security concerned, the branch has been visited by the BDM Julie Pollard

on several occasions and the branch security features were shown and briefed as three new jail

POL00108851
POL00108851

door electronic motorised remote controlled shuttered, occupancy of the flat above the office new

DVR Camera system were fitted and installed after taking the office over.

No such issues has been reported or brought to attention by any Post Office Ltd representative

at the vi

During the whole enquiry and investigation no issues or concerns were questions declared,

raised or questioned.

In the last six months al! other offices in my territory namely Northenden post office, Hall lane post

office, Wendover post office, Sale post office has been subject to robberies, burglaries, not my

office.

GROUND 3

Failing to register a Sub Office assistant with Post Office Ltd.

In the office there were only me , my Mrs working the third one Krystal Lomas was only the
Voluntary Trainee not employee any voluntary trainee does not subject to registration until employed
, | was registered with employment office and in the process of recruitment , a number of

candidates were interviewed and under the process of selection.

EVIDENCE D ENCLOSED

Krystal lomas was not appointed ,selected or offered any kind of employment and never entered in

Previously | have already written you the history of the personal affairs, my struggle, efforts,
interest, and my journey to become a sub postmaster. However | would like to give you some detail

of points to consider.

This is the story of my hardship to become a sub postmaster.

We the whole family shared the supplement efforts to get this office.

| and my Mrs were suitable to run post office as a small family business.

We are a small family with two little boys belongs to a good well to do family. Before | become a
sub postmaster we were in a good respectable profession and referred with a good personal and i

professional reference.

To purchase this office we all our savings, loans, my kids saving, my mother in law also sent me

some money

| had a business loan of 175,000 from the bank.
| had an additional foan of 10,000 from Bolton business venture

My kids saving of 5,000 were invested.

My mother in law sent 8,000 from Pakistan

A second charge was taken over for our house as security.

EVIDENCE G ENCLOSED

| did a lot of search and preparation for the process of selection and interview.

It took me a lot of guts and hard work to get appointed.

After appointment, only 12 days training was provided and a bad office transfer was under taken.

POL00108851
POL00108851

Since then my whole family including little kids dedicated and devoted to the office, the boys were

transfer to a school and nursery near to the office.

J and the Mrs worked all day, 6 days a week, some time seven days.

The customer was very happy with a family run office, the atmosphere, the service and care, the

presentation of the office. i

We worked very hard to put the office in the right shape and to build the business. {

It. was just the beginning, with in four months time my mother was very ill_ and requested me to

visit her before she is dead, | knew the responsibility of my position and did not go, she died in

October still could not go because of the festive season and office high peak business time, |

cared about the post office services and sacrificed for it.

| maintained a high performance and good office business with out any complaints or issues.

{ and my Mrs worked very hard spent most of the time to improve the office and neglect our home

or social life

standing behind the counter all the day which

We came into post office business because we have a good family background, education, honesty,
enthusiasm and motivation and knew that it was the most appropriate profession for the people like

us who wants to work and live with respect, character, pride and prestige.

Considering the all above | believe that while a probiem was already identified and under the
process of rectification by the end of TP10 Why a suspension was imposed and changed into a

dilemma and complex issue.
POL00108851
POL00108851

| trust and believe, | should not be put through all that and now no physical or theoritial evidence {

has been found, nothing revealed therefore | should not be terminated.

‘Taking into consideration your position in this mater. |

As up to now | have been very honest, reasonable, fair, justified, | want to resolve the matter by

understanding, mutual, bilateral talks.

Since the issue raised | have assisted you and the investigation team a step forward, and never

lied, mislead or concealed any material of fact.

As far as the discrepancy concerned, you or investigation team or auditors, trainer, cash

management team, helpline. have not revealed any misconduct, irregularity, suspicious activity,

lies or any kind of contravention.

During my office term | have been visited by BDM Julie Pollard, trainer Marina Slade, Paul

Hayhurst, None of them has revealed or reported any failure of duty or breach of contract for

the service or negligence.

| really appreciate and thankful to you for giving me an opportunity to put forward my version to

charges.

From the day, the problem began with the stock BB, the concerned department were aware and
involved, the cash management team and the chesterfield knew the office remittance, and office
cash holding figures, cash declarations were correct and does not certify or permit the shortage. I
kept explaining and written to Steve Bradshaw and you a number of statements and explanation

about the problem has recorded and been sent to you step by step previously.

| always sald to you that my character Is every thing , | have lived with pride and prestige and |

have invested the last penny of my family money, not only money but the time , effort , devotion

,eare , sacrifice, honesty, risks, and not had any reward or reap from the business yet.

|

We live in an imperfect world and makes mistakes, the pilot crashes planes, the computers

crashes, the trains collides, people killed in accident, the buildings collapses, the high security fails.

During our telephone conversation | also told you that | have a complete faith and trust in you and

wants to resolve the issue by harmony, mutual understanding and negotiation rather aggressions.

Though | have got an insurance policy for legal expenses but | do not intend to make the issue

bitter, controversial by passing it to the solicitor to start legal battle and war.

Although i am not under obligation or principally and legally not supposes to offer you any

reimbursement for an unexplained, unproved and non existed discrepancy or money which has

never been remit or taken away however just to show my decency and in an attempt to save

my character and prestige in the best interest of both parties and as a gesture of good will:- |

As you have already taken 10,000 , which was my money, in addition to that amount |_am

willing to pay another half of the deficiency 33,000 in instalment deducted each month from my

salary provided | get reinstate immediately. | will assume that that | have bought the office very

expensive.

OR

Transfer the office to Novera Syed immediately.

POL00108851
POL00108851

In both cases the half of the deficiency will be paid as agreed, if the business is sold while we

are the sub postmaster / sub postmistress we will pay the remaining amount of the payment in

full.

Acceptance of any of above will benefit for both parties, | will save my character and my family

livelihood and bread and butter for my kids, and you will get sufficient cash back of an

anonymous and unexplained non existed unseen discrepancy and the matter will be resolved

happily rather becoming more bitter, difficult complicate , inconvenience and court battle.

with_ this letter as my resignation | clarify that in the event of resignation or none transfer to

Novera Syed the guod will offer will be withdrawn and no payments offer will be applicable .

Any dispute or claims will be forward to my solicitor who will endeavour the next course of |

action and dealt accordingly. |

As far as office concern it is over three months now and has been managed and run by interim sub
postmaster, under the current situation and circumstances {am not happy and in total loss, under
duress and financially struggling and behind the mortgage payments and not In a position to let it

be continued, as it is not viable or worth while, | will notify you of his exit very soon.

If you compare the business done in my office term with current level of business you will notice a

drastic business loss and foot fall and its only because of our hard work , customer care ,

relationship , personality , presentation, atmosphere and friendly and excellent service.

| believe that | have done very best to resolve the matter.

| don’t know what else to say apart from that no body is perfect, we all makes mistakes and learn.

the logic, statistical figures, mathematical calculations and circumstantial evidence suggest no

discrepancy or contravention.
