OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE

Please find attached a submission (and annexes) on the Post Office’s Long Term Vision, thanks to the
Post Office policy team, UKGI, BEIS Finance, legal and analyst colleagues. Unfortunately share point is
playing up so I have been unable to send you the link.

We would be grateful for Kelly’s steers by 30" October if possible. The submission was sent to SpAds
for information and they confirmed they did not have any comments.

Kind regards
