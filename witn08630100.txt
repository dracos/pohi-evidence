POST OFFICE HORIZON ENQUIRY

FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF IAIN MURPHY

|, lain Murphy, will say as follows...

1. This witness statement is made to assist the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry (the
‘Inquiry’) with the matters set out in Rule 9 Request dated 14 April 2023 (the

‘Request”).

Background
2. _|amasecurity professional with over 25 years security experience, mainly in Physical

& People Security management.

3. | worked at the Post Office for a very brief period in my career over 10 years ago.

Given the passage of time, | may struggle to remember/recollect but will try to answer

the questions as accurately as | can where | can.

4. | started employment with the Post Office on 14 Jul 2008 as a Senior Security
Manager. | left on 26 Feb 2011, still as a Senior Security Manager having taken

voluntary redundancy. So, | spent two and a half years employed with the Post Office.

5. | was brought in by John Scott (Head of Security) to lead the ‘Security Crime Risk
Team’ which | did for the first year. The Security Crime Risk Team was a small team
of security analysts and our role was to develop a risk-based methodology to the
external crime threat facing the Post Office. Essentially, directing the wider security
teams to where we thought crime was most likely going to happen. Crime as in

external crime — robberies, thefts, etc from malicious outsiders.

6. | think it was around August 2009 that John Scott asked me to lead his Fraud Team,
taking over from David Pardoe who | believe had led this strand for a number of years
previously. For note, | was surprised that John asked me to take this role on as |
believe | was the least qualified and the most junior of his Senior Managers. There
were far more experienced and qualified senior managers he could have chosen. |

also do not recall being given any training to prepare me for the role.

7. | decided to take Voluntary Redundancy and left the business in Feb 11. So, | would
estimate | led the fraud strand for approx. one and a half years. During this time, |
relied heavily on a Senior Security Manager called Andrew Hayworth (he was
essentially my deputy), who | recall delegated a lot of the running of the Team too.
Andrew was a seasoned Fraud Team Senior Manager and had far more experience

than me to manage the team, so | was happy to delegate to Andrew.

Given my brief spell with the Fraud Team and my experience and understanding of its

activities, | apologise in advance for my limited responses to your questions below.

The role of the Security team and the policies/practices in place relating to
criminal investigation and prosecution

| have been asked to provide an account of the role which the security team played,
for the period of time | worked within it, and the policies / practices in place relating to
criminal investigation and prosecution of SPMs/Crown Office employees. Including
where the role / policies / practices changed over this period of time and in particular

to address the rationale behind the practice of bringing private prosecutions.

My recollection was that the Security Team played a key role in the investigating and
prosecution of SPM’s and Crown Office staff on behalf of the Post Office. It certainly
felt like it was a key objective of John Scott to investigate crime and prosecute where

evidence of criminality was found.

| do not recall the policies or any change to policies. | also do not recall any changes

to the practices of investigating crime.

| also do not recall any private prosecutions. | was only aware of cases being submitted
to criminal courts and where applicable, assets recovered back to POL (from crime)

by the Fraud Team's specialist Financial Investigators using the POCA.

| have been provided with the document entitled “A Brief History of Investigations,

Prosecutions and Security in Royal Mail” URN LCAS0000124 and asked to explain

Page 3 of 22
14.

WITN08630100
WITN08630100

why Royal Mail Group Ltd (before the separation of the Post Office) and later POL
(after the separation) had a practice of bringing private prosecutions against its agents
/ staff where they were suspect of financial crime, rather than referring the matters to
the police / the CPS. | do not recall any private prosecutions. | also do not recall any

policies relating to this.

Policies governing the conduct of criminal investigations by the Security team
and organisational structure
| have been asked to consider the following documents and explain my role in the
development, authorisation, management and/or assurance of any of the policies
listed below.
i) “Royal Mail Group Ltd Criminal Investigation and Prosecution Policy” (1
December 2007) (POL00030578, which appears to be substantially the same as
the policy of the same date with a variation on the title at POL00104812) (see, in
particular, section 3);
ii) “Royal Mail Group Security — Procedures & Standards — Standards of
Behaviour and Complaints Procedure” (version 2, October 2007)
(POL00104806);
iii) “Royal Mail Group Crime and Investigation (S2)” (version 3.0, September
2008) (POL00031004);

(POL00030786).

| do not recall having any input, development, authorisation, management and/or

assurance of any of the policies listed above.

The organisational structure of the Security team including the different divisions within
the Security team and their respective functions when | held relevant roles | have
outlined, to the best of my knowledge. My recollection was that the Security Team was
split into 4 x specialist teams. A Security Crime Risk Team, a Fraud Team, a

Commercial Security Team and a Physical Security Team.

The Security Crime Risk Team was tasked with developing a risk based security

strategy and looking ahead for threats and trends.

The Fraud Team was tasked to investigate crime, interview suspects, prepare case
files for criminal court and support POL lawyers with prosecutions. It also had a small
team of financial investigators who would try and recover assets for the company that

were gained from the Proceeds of Crime (using POCA legislation).

| cannot recall what the Commercial Security Team did.

The Physical Security Team were responsible for implementing physical security
controls like CCTV, Alarms across the POL estate. In an effort to detect and deter

crime.

| cannot recall any major changes to this structure whilst | was there.

| do not recall who within the investigation team determined how a criminal

investigation would be conducted.

| believe the role of the Financial Investigation Unit was to recovering assets via the

Proceeds of Crime Act, where someone had been found guilty.

| do not recall which other teams within the Post Office were involved in criminal

investigations and prosecutions, what their roles were in the process and how the

Security team worked with them in this area.

| do not recall specific legislation, policies or principles or any changes that governed
the conduct of investigations conducted by the Security team during the period |

worked within it.

| do not recall what the process was for dealing with complaints about the conduct of
an investigation by the Security team. | would assume any complaint would have been

directed to POL Legal and/or John Scott.

My recollection is that Andy Hayward performed a supervisory role to the fraud

managers (and their case files) and John Scott having oversight of all investigations.

| have been asked to explain the Post Office’s approach to suspected fraud and the
responsibilities of the Security team in combatting fraud. | believe Fraud was an
important risk area for the Post Office and the Security Team was tasked to reduce

fraud where possible.

| do not recall how Post Office policy and practice regarding investigation and
prosecution of Crown Office employees differed from the policy and practice regarding
investigation and prosecution of SPMs, if at all. | do not recall if this changed over the
period of time | held relevant roles within the Security team. | do not recall how and

when the Security team became involved in an investigation.

| have been asked to explain the circumstances in which an auditor would be sent to

conduct an audit at a Post Office branch. | do not recall.

| have been asked to consider the document “Condensed Guide for Audit Attendance”
(version 2, October 2008) (POL00084813) and to explain in what circumstances would
an investigator attend an audit of a branch and what was an investigator’s role on

attendance. | do not recall.

| do not recall who an auditor would report a shortfall or discrepancy to if a shortfall

was identified during an audit of a branch.

| have been asked, where a shortfall was identified following an audit of a SPM’s
branch: i) What and who determined whether an investigation into potential criminality
was conducted by the Security team or the case was taken forwards as a debt
recovery matter by the Financial Services Centre and / or the relevant legal team?
And did this change during the period | worked within the Security team. | do not recall
this information. | also do not recall whether the SPM's local contract manager had
any input into this decision-making process. Nor do | recall whether this changed

during the period | worked within the Security team.

| have been asked to consider Appendix 1 to POL00104825. | do not recall what were
the triggers / criteria for raising a fraud case following the identification of a shortfall /
discrepancy in a SPM’s branch. | do not recall if the triggers / criteria for raising a theft
or false accounting case were different and whether they changed during the period |

worked within the Security team.

| have been asked to consider the memo dated 15 December 2009 at POL00104825

and answer the following questions:

Page 8 of 22
WITN08630100
WITN08630100

a. What was the rationale for conducting cash verification exercises in all branches
“(except Crowns)” ahead of the migration to Horizon online? | do not recall.

b. To your knowledge, what was the impact of this requirement and the migration to
Horizon online more broadly on the work of the Fraud team? | do not recall.

c. Appendix 2 within POL00104825 sets out three levels of officer status for
members of the Security team. Did the requirement that cash verifications be
carried out at all non-Crown branches impact upon the decision making around
what level of officer should be involved in potential fraud investigations? | do not

recall.

36. | do not recall how decisions about suspensions were linked to decisions about

whether to raise a fraud case.

Involvement of the Security team in the suspension process

37. | have been asked to consider the following documents: i) “Royal Mail Group Security
— Procedures & Standards — Suspension from Duty” (version 1, November 2005)
(POL00104809); ii) “Royal Mail Internal Information — Criminal Investigation Team —

7.11 Suspension from Duty” (version 1.0 final, May 2012) (POL00105231).

38. | do not recall what was the Security team’s role in suspension decisions where a

shortfall was identified by an audit.

39. | donot recall how the decision-making around suspension differed as between Crown

Office employees and a SPM at an agency branch.

conducting their investigations once a decision had been made to conduct a criminal

investigation and | do not recall what the process was.

| have been asked to consider the documents referred to in paragraph 14 of my
statement above and URN POL00105223 which is from February 2013 and sets out

POL00008515, POL00010929, POL00010488 and POL00010039 and address the
following queries.

i) Please explain what a “DAM Authority” was; | believe DAM stood for ‘Duty
Authorisation Manager’. | have very little recollection of what my ‘DAM’ role was,
however | can see from the email’s that | approved (to proceed) some cases
based on legal recommendations.

ii) Was there a time when you were responsible for all “DAM Authorities”?;

| do not recall. Based on the files, it looks like | approved 4 x DAM authorities
during my time leading the fraud strand, although | have no recollection of doing
these. | can see that Andy Hayward also approved DAM’s.

iii) When and why did you take on this role?; | do not recall. | don’t even
remember taking this role on to be honest. | assume it was part of being a Senior
Security Manger and we all had to take our turn?

iv) What training (if any) were you given to assist you in making decisions on
“DAM Authorities”? | don’t recall any training being provided to me to support me
with this responsibility.

(v) Did you ever deviate from the legal advice on whether to prosecute an
individual? | do not recall. If | did, it would not have been intentional or deliberate.
| can see in the files that | approved based on legal recommendation. If Legal

hadn’t recommended | believe | wouldn’t have approved these DAM authorities.

50. | do not recall whether the legal advice on prosecutions was provided by internal or

external lawyers, or both.

Analysing Horizon data and requesting ARQ data from Fujitsu

| have been asked to consider the last heading on page 6 of the document entitled
“Security Operations Casework Review” (February 2013) at POL00105223. Prior to
the introduction of the tool Credence (which the Inquiry understands to have been
introduced in 2009), and to answer what analysis was done by Security team
investigators of Horizon data when a SPM / SPM'’s assistant / Crown Office employee
attributed a shortfall to problems with Horizon. | have also been asked to consider

72. | have been asked to consider the email chain from 2010 at POL00004708. | have
been asked what action | understood the Post Office to have taken against the SPM
in question and which teams had been involved by this point. | do not recall. It looks
like | had very little involvement in this other that asking one of the investigators ‘to

take a look’.

73. | do not recall what | understood or whether | agreed with Mark Dinsdale’s comment
that sending in an auditor who sat with the SPM in question “clearly made matters

worse”.

74. | do not recall whether | considered that an auditor “corroborating” a SPM’s account

that there were problems with the operation of Horizon equipment at the branch was

supportive of her assertion that the shortfall was caused by the Horizon system.

be. | do not recall What other logs there were and how they differed.

76. | do not recall whose decision it was whether ARQ data was requested from Fujitsu in

assistanUCrown Office employee was attributing the shortfall to problems with
Horizon, where the SPM / SPM’s assistant / Crown Office employee did not have
corroborating evidence of material problems with Horizon, was ARQ data requested

from Fujitsu as a matter of course and if not why not. | do not recall.

79. |donotrecall why, when ARQ data was obtained from Fujitsu, in circumstances where
a shortfall had been identified and the relevant SPM was attributing the shortfall to
problems with Horizon, why this data was not provided to the SPM in question as a
matter of course. | have been referred to (the emails from Mark Dinsdale dated 24

June 2010, timed at 17.37 and 6 August 2010, timed at 17.43). URN POL00004708

80. | do not recall what (if any) bearing this had on the fact that this SPM had joined with
other SPMs in challenging the integrity of Horizon (publicly) or on the Post Office

decision-making about this case.

Challenges to the integrity of Horizon and their impact on prosecutorial
decisions

| have been asked to consider the email chain from August 2010 at POL00012537. |
do not recall how the rise in the number of “Horizon Integrity” challenges impacted
upon the way such cases were investigated and decisions about whether to proceed

with or maintain a prosecution.

The Security team’s role in relation to debt recovery

| have been asked to consider the document entitled “Former Subpostmaster End to
End Debt Review” and dated December 2009 at POL00084977 and the Terms of
Reference for the “BOEP Debt Review” at POL00085009. | have been asked to

| do not recall whether | had, or were aware of, any concerns regarding the robustness
of the Horizon IT system during my time working for the Post Office. In this context,
the term “robustness” includes (a) the accuracy and integrity of the data recorded and
processed by the Horizon IT System (b) the extent to which deficiencies in the Horizon
IT System were capable of causing and / or caused apparent discrepancies or

shortfalls in the branch accounts (c) the ability of the Horizon IT System to identify

errors in data and discrepancies or shortfalls in branch accounts and the cause of the
same and (d) the ability of the Horizon IT System continue to operate satisfactorily in

the presence of adverse conditions.

| do not recall reporting any concerns | had with Horizon or whether if | did, anyone

responded.

| have been asked to consider section 6 of the “Post Office Ltd — Security Policy:
Accounting losses policy for agency branches” (version 1, February 2003) at
POL00086845) and the same section in the “Post Office Ltd - Security Policy: Liability
for losses policy (for agency branches)” (version 1.7, September 2003)
(POL00088867). | have been asked whether the suggestion that system faults with
Horizon were “very rare” corresponded with my understanding of the position in 2003.

I do not recall.

Other Matters

There are no other matters that | wish to bring to the attention of the Chair of the
