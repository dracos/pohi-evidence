                                 POST OFFICE HORIZON ENQUIRY




                         FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF IAIN MURPHY




I, lain Murphy, will say as follows_ . .



1.    This witness statement is made to assist the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry (the

      'Inquiry') with the matters set out in Rule 9 Request dated 14 April 2023 (the

      'Request")



      Background

2.    I am a security professional with over 25 years security experience, mainly in Physical

      & People Security management.



3.    1 worked at the Post Office for a very brief period in my career over 10 years ago.

      Given the passage of time, I may struggle to remember/recollect but will try to answer

      the questions as accurately as I can where I can.

                                                                                        WITN08630100




4.   I started employment with the Post Office on 14 Jul 2008 as a Senior Security

     Manager. I left on 26 Feb 2011, still as a Senior Security Manager having taken

     voluntary redundancy. So, I spent two and a half years employed with the Post Office.



5.   I was brought in by John Scott (Head of Security) to lead the `Security Crime Risk

     Team' which I did for the first year. The Security Crime Risk Team was a small team

     of security analysts and our role was to develop a risk-based methodology to the

     external crime threat facing the Post Office. Essentially, directing the wider security

     teams to where we thought crime was most likely going to happen. Crime as in

     external crime — robberies, thefts, etc from malicious outsiders.



6.   I think it was around August 2009 that John Scott asked me to lead his Fraud Team,

     taking over from David Pardoe who I believe had led this strand for a number of years

     previously. For note, I was surprised that John asked me to take this role on as I

     believe I was the least qualified and the most junior of his Senior Managers. There

     were far more experienced and qualified senior managers he could have chosen. I

     also do not recall being given any training to prepare me for the role.



7.   I decided to take Voluntary Redundancy and left the business in Feb 11. So, I would

     estimate I led the fraud strand for approx. one and a half years. During this time, I

     relied heavily on a Senior Security Manager called Andrew Hayworth (he was

     essentially my deputy), who I recall delegated a lot of the running of the Team too.

     Andrew was a seasoned Fraud Team Senior Manager and had far more experience

     than me to manage the team, so I was happy to delegate to Andrew.

8.   Given my brief spell with the Fraud Team and my experience and understanding of its

     activities, I apologise in advance for my limited responses to your questions below.



     The role of the Security team and the policies/practices in place relating to

     criminal investigation and prosecution

9.   I have been asked to provide an account of the role which the security team played,

     for the period of time I worked within it, and the policies / practices in place relating to

     criminal investigation and prosecution of SPMslCrown Office employees. Including

     where the role I policies I practices changed over this period of time and in particular

     to address the rationale behind the practice of bringing private prosecutions.



10. My recollection was that the Security Team played a key role in the investigating and

     prosecution of SPM's and Crown Office staff on behalf of the Post Office. It certainly

     felt like it was a key objective of John Scott to investigate crime and prosecute where

     evidence of criminality was found.



11. I do not recall the policies or any change to policies. I also do not recall any changes

     to the practices of investigating crime.



12. I also do not recall any private prosecutions. I was only aware of cases being submitted

     to criminal courts and where applicable, assets recovered back to POL (from crime)

     by the Fraud Team's specialist Financial Investigators using the POCA.



13. I have been provided with the document entitled "A Brief History of Investigations,

     Prosecutions and Security in Royal Mail" URN LCAS0000124 and asked to explain



                                            Page 3 of 22

                                                                                          WITN08630100




     why Royal Mail Group Ltd (before the separation of the Post Office) and later POL

     (after the separation) had a practice of bringing private prosecutions against its agents

    I staff where they were suspect of financial crime, rather than referring the matters to

     the police / the CPS. I do not recall any private prosecutions. I also do not recall any

     policies relating to this.



    Policies governing the conduct of criminal investigations by the Security team

     and organisational structure

14. I have been asked to consider the following documents and explain my role in the

     development, authorisation, management and/or assurance of any of the policies

     listed below.

          i) "Royal Mail Group Ltd Criminal Investigation and Prosecution Policy" (1

          December 2007) (POL00030578, which appears to be substantially the same as

          the policy of the same date with a variation on the title at POL00104812) (see, in

          particular, section 3);

          ii) "Royal Mail Group Security — Procedures & Standards — Standards of

          Behaviour      and      Complaints     Procedure"   (version   2,   October   2007)

          (POL00104806);

          iii) "Royal Mail Group Crime and Investigation (S2)" (version 3.0, September

          2008) (POL00031004);

          iv) "Royal Mail Group Crime and Investigation Policy" (version 1.1, October 2009)

          (POL00031003);

          v) "Post Office Ltd — Security Policy — Fraud Investigation and Prosecution Policy"

          (version 2, 4 April 2010) (POL00030580);

          vi) "Post Office Ltd Financial Investigation Policy" (4 May 2010) (POL00030579);



                                               Page 4 of 22
                                                                                            WITNO8630100
                                                                                          WITN08630100




          vii) "Royal Mail Group Security - Procedures & Standards — The Proceeds of

          Crime Act 2002 & Financial Investigations" (version 1, September 2010)

          (POL00026573);

          viii) "Royal Mail Group Security - Procedures & Standards — Initiating

          Investigations" (September 2010);

          ix) "Royal Mail Group Ltd Criminal Investigation and Prosecution Policy" (version

          1.1, November 2010) (POL00031008);

          x) Post Office Ltd Financial Investigation Policy (version 2, February 2011)

          (POL00104853);

          xi) Post Office Ltd Anti-Fraud Policy (February 2011) (POL00104855);

          xii) "Royal Mail Group Policy Crime and Investigation S2" (version 3.0, April 2011)

          (POL00030786).



15. I do not recall having any input, development, authorisation, management and/or

     assurance of any of the policies listed above.



16. The organisational structure of the Security team including the different divisions within

     the Security team and their respective functions when I held relevant roles I have

     outlined, to the best of my knowledge. My recollection was that the Security Team was

     split into 4 x specialist teams. A Security Crime Risk Team, a Fraud Team, a

     Commercial Security Team and a Physical Security Team.



17. The Security Crime Risk Team was tasked with developing a risk based security

     strategy and looking ahead for threats and trends.

                                                                                        WITN08630100




18. The Fraud Team was tasked to investigate crime, interview suspects, prepare case

     files for criminal court and support POL lawyers with prosecutions. It also had a small

     team of financial investigators who would try and recover assets for the company that

     were gained from the Proceeds of Crime (using POCA legislation).



19. I cannot recall what the Commercial Security Team did.




20. The Physical Security Team were responsible for implementing physical security

     controls like CCTV, Alarms across the POL estate. In an effort to detect and deter

     crime.



21. I cannot recall any major changes to this structure whilst I was there.




22. I do not recall who within the investigation team determined how a criminal

     investigation would be conducted.



23. I believe the role of the Financial Investigation Unit was to recovering assets via the

     Proceeds of Crime Act, where someone had been found guilty.



24. I do not recall which other teams within the Post Office were involved in criminal

     investigations and prosecutions, what their roles were in the process and how the

     Security team worked with them in this area.

                                                                                           WITN08630100




25. I do not recall specific legislation, policies or principles or any changes that governed

     the conduct of investigations conducted by the Security team during the period I

     worked within it.



26. I do not recall what the process was for dealing with complaints about the conduct of

     an investigation by the Security team. I would assume any complaint would have been

     directed to POL Legal and/or John Scott.



27. My recollection is that Andy Hayward performed a supervisory role to the fraud

     managers (and their case files) and John Scott having oversight of all investigations.



28. I have been asked to explain the Post Office's approach to suspected fraud and the

     responsibilities of the Security team in combatting fraud. I believe Fraud was an

     important risk area for the Post Office and the Security Team was tasked to reduce

     fraud where possible.



29. I do not recall how Post Office policy and practice regarding investigation and

     prosecution of Crown Office employees differed from the policy and practice regarding

     investigation and prosecution of SPMs, if at all. I do not recall if this changed over the

     period of time I held relevant roles within the Security team. I do not recall how and

     when the Security team became involved in an investigation.



30. I have been asked to explain the circumstances in which an auditor would be sent to

     conduct an audit at a Post Office branch. I do not recall.

31. I have been asked to consider the document "Condensed Guide for Audit Attendance"

     (version 2, October 2008) (POL00084813) and to explain in what circumstances would

     an investigator attend an audit of a branch and what was an investigator's role on

     attendance. I do not recall.



32. I do not recall who an auditor would report a shortfall or discrepancy to if a shortfall

     was identified during an audit of a branch.



33. I have been asked, where a shortfall was identified following an audit of a SPM's

     branch: i) What and who determined whether an investigation into potential criminality

     was conducted by the Security team or the case was taken forwards as a debt

     recovery matter by the Financial Services Centre and / or the relevant legal team?

     And did this change during the period I worked within the Security team. I do not recall

     this information. I also do not recall whether the SPM's local contract manager had

     any input into this decision-making process. Nor do I recall whether this changed

     during the period I worked within the Security team.



34. I have been asked to consider Appendix 1 to POL00104825. I do not recall what were

     the triggers / criteria for raising a fraud case following the identification of a shortfall /

     discrepancy in a SPM's branch. I do not recall if the triggers / criteria for raising a theft

     or false accounting case were different and whether they changed during the period I

     worked within the Security team.



35. I have been asked to consider the memo dated 15 December 2009 at POL00104825

     and answer the following questions:



                                            Page 8 of 22

                                                                                           WITN08630100




       a. What was the rationale for conducting cash verification exercises in all branches

           "(except Crowns)" ahead of the migration to Horizon online? I do not recall.

       b. To your knowledge, what was the impact of this requirement and the migration to

           Horizon online more broadly on the work of the Fraud team? I do not recall.

       c. Appendix 2 within POL00104825 sets out three levels of officer status for

           members of the Security team. Did the requirement that cash verifications be

           carried out at all non-Crown branches impact upon the decision making around

           what level of officer should be involved in potential fraud investigations? I do not

           recall.



36    I do not recall how decisions about suspensions were linked to decisions about

      whether to raise a fraud case.



      Involvement of the Security team in the suspension process

37_   I have been asked to consider the following documents: i) "Royal Mail Group Security

      — Procedures & Standards — Suspension from Duty" (version 1, November 2005)

      (POL00104809); ii) "Royal Mail Internal Information — Criminal Investigation Team —

      7.11 Suspension from Duty" (version 1.0 final, May 2012) (POL00105231).



38.   I do not recall what was the Security team's role in suspension decisions where a

      shortfall was identified by an audit.



39.   I do not recall how the decision-making around suspension differed as between Crown

      Office employees and a SPM at an agency branch.

     The process followed by Security team investigators when conducting a

     criminal investigation following the identification of a shortfall at an audit

40. I have been asked what process did the Security team investigators follow in

     conducting their investigations once a decision had been made to conduct a criminal

     investigation and I do not recall what the process was.



41. I have been asked to consider the documents referred to in paragraph 14 of my

     statement above and URN POL00105223 which is from February 2013 and sets out

     a process for Security team investigators to follow and to comment on how this

     process differed prior to this date but I do not recall.



     Decisions about prosecution and criminal enforcement proceedings

42. I have been asked to consider the following documents:

          i) "Post Office Internal Prosecution Policy (Dishonesty)" (December 1997)

          (POL00030659);

          ii) "Royal Mail Group Policy Prosecution (S3)" (created September 2008, version

      of any of the policies listed above. I do not recall having any input, development,

      authorisation, management or assurance of any of the policies listed above.



44    I have been asked to describe the Post Office prosecution policy, the rationale behind

      it, its aims and any ways in which it changed during the period you held relevant roles

      within the Post Office. I do not recall this policy.



45.   I do not recall who, following an investigation, made the decision as to whether a SPM

      or Crown Office employee should be prosecuted by the Post Office or what

      considerations would determine whether a prosecution was brought.



46_   I do not recall whether the SPM's local contract manager had any input into the

      decision-making process or whether this changed during the period I worked within

      the Security team.



47.   I do not recall, when a decision was made to start a prosecution, what test was applied

      or what factors were considered at the public interest stage.



48.   1 do not recall what advice, legal or otherwise, was provided to those making decisions

      about whether to prosecute.

      following queries.

          i) Please explain what a "DAM Authority" was; I believe DAM stood for 'Duty

          Authorisation Manager'. I have very little recollection of what my `DAM' role was,

          however I can see from the email's that 1 approved (to proceed) some cases

          based on legal recommendations.

          ii) Was there a time when you were responsible for all "DAM Authorities"?;

          I do not recall. Based on the files, it looks like I approved 4 x DAM authorities

          during my time leading the fraud strand, although 1 have no recollection of doing

          these. I can see that Andy Hayward also approved DAM's.

          iii) When and why did you take on this role?;          I do not recall. I don't even

          remember taking this role on to be honest. I assume it was part of being a Senior

          Security Manger and we all had to take our turn?

          iv) What training (if any) were you given to assist you in making decisions on

          "DAM Authorities"? I don't recall any training being provided to me to support me

          with this responsibility.

          (v) Did you ever deviate from the legal advice on whether to prosecute an

          individual? I do not recall. If I did, it would not have been intentional or deliberate.

          I can see in the files that I approved based on legal recommendation. If Legal

          hadn't recommended I believe I wouldn't have approved these DAM authorities.



50.   I do not recall whether the legal advice on prosecutions was provided by internal or

      external lawyers, or both.

     Analysing Horizon data and requesting ARQ data from Fujitsu

69. I have been asked to consider the last heading on page 6 of the document entitled

     "Security Operations Casework Review" (February 2013) at POL00105223. Prior to

     the introduction of the tool Credence (which the Inquiry understands to have been

     introduced in 2009), and to answer what analysis was done by Security team

     investigators of Horizon data when a SPM / SPM's assistant / Crown Office employee

     attributed a shortfall to problems with Horizon. I have also been asked to consider

     document at POL00105213 and its relevance to this question and if I can assist with

     the likely date of the document. I do not recall.



70. I do not recall for the period of time I held relevant roles within the Security team, the

     process for requesting Horizon data from Fujitsu and how that process changed over

     time.



71. I do not recall whether prior to the publication of "Security Investigations Data Handling

     Process (Fujitsu Horizon Data Request)" in September 2013 (see POL00105222),

     there was a formalised process for requesting ARQ data from Fujitsu.

72. I have been asked to consider the email chain from 2010 at POL00004708. I have

     been asked what action I understood the Post Office to have taken against the SPM

     in question and which teams had been involved by this point. I do not recall. It looks

     like I had very little involvement in this other that asking one of the investigators to

     take a look'.




73. I do not recall what I understood or whether I agreed with Mark Dinsdale's comment

     that sending in an auditor who sat with the SPM in question "clearly made matters

     worse".



74. I do not recall whether I considered that an auditor "corroborating" a SPM's account

     that there were problems with the operation of Horizon equipment at the branch was

     supportive of her assertion that the shortfall was caused by the Horizon system.



75. I do not recall what ARQ logs were and do not recall what I understood their use to

     be. I do not recall What other logs there were and how they differed.



76. I do not recall whose decision it was whether ARQ data was requested from Fujitsu in

     any given case.



77. I have been asked why the decision was made to obtain ARQ data in the case referred

     to in the email chain from 2010 at POL00004708 and I do not recall this information.

78.   1 have been asked where a shortfall had been identified and the relevant SPM / SPM's

      assistant/Crown Office employee was attributing the shortfall to problems with

      Horizon, where the SPM / SPM's assistant l Crown Office employee did not have

      corroborating evidence of material problems with Horizon, was ARQ data requested

      from Fujitsu as a matter of course and if not why not. I do not recall.



79    I do not recall why, when ARQ data was obtained from Fujitsu, in circumstances where

      a shortfall had been identified and the relevant SPM was attributing the shortfall to

      problems with Horizon, why this data was not provided to the SPM in question as a

      matter of course. I have been referred to (the emails from Mark Dinsdale dated 24

      June 2010, timed at 17.37 and 6 August 2010, timed at 17.43). URN POL00004708



80.   1 do not recall what (if any) bearing this had on the fact that this SPM had joined with

      other SPMs in challenging the integrity of Horizon (publicly) or on the Post Office

      decision-making about this case.

     Challenges to the integrity of Horizon and their impact on prosecutorial

     decisions

84. I have been asked to consider the email chain from August 2010 at POL00012537. I

     do not recall how the rise in the number of "Horizon Integrity" challenges impacted

     upon the way such cases were investigated and decisions about whether to proceed

     with or maintain a prosecution.



     The Security team's role in relation to debt recovery

85. I have been asked to consider the document entitled "Former Subpostmaster End to

     End Debt Review" and dated December 2009 at POL00084977 and the Terms of

     Reference for the "BOEP Debt Review" at POL00085009. I have been asked to

     explain a) my role and b) the Security team's role in relation to recovery of debt from

     current and former SPMs. I do not recall.



86. I do not recall how the 2009 review into agent debt and the work of the Back Office

     Efficiency Programme impacted upon the approach of the Post Office to the pursuit of

     current and former SPMs for debt owed to the Post Office.



     Knowledge of bugs, errors and defects in the Horizon system

87. I do not recall whether I had, or were aware of, any concerns regarding the robustness

     of the Horizon IT system during my time working for the Post Office. In this context,

     the term "robustness" includes (a) the accuracy and integrity of the data recorded and

     processed by the Horizon IT System (b) the extent to which deficiencies in the Horizon

     IT System were capable of causing and / or caused apparent discrepancies or

     shortfalls in the branch accounts (c) the ability of the Horizon IT System to identify

     errors in data and discrepancies or shortfalls in branch accounts and the cause of the

     same and (d) the ability of the Horizon IT System continue to operate satisfactorily in

     the presence of adverse conditions.



88. I do not recall reporting any concerns I had with Horizon or whether if I did, anyone

     responded.



89. I have been asked to consider section 6 of the "Post Office Ltd — Security Policy:

     Accounting losses policy for agency branches" (version 1, February 2003) at

     POL00086845) and the same section in the "Post Office Ltd — Security Policy: Liability

     for losses policy (for agency branches)" (version 1.7, September 2003)

     (POL00088867)_ I have been asked whether the suggestion that system faults with

     Horizon were "very rare" corresponded with my understanding of the position in 2003.

     I do not recall.



     Other Matters

90. There are no other matters that I wish to bring to the attention of the Chair of the

     Inquiry.
