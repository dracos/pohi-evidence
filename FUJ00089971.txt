2 Introduction

This section describes the objective of the document, any history of its production and other background
information, but excludes material that is already contained in the preceding document control sections.

2.1 Purpose

This document is intended to detail Post Office requirements for the IMPACT Release 3 Branch Trading
project. It is intended to act as the baseline reference for those involved in the various stages of design,
development, deployment and support for the component parts of the Branch Trading project. It is also
intended to support the concurrence and approval process required for the solutions that are to be
implemented to meet the specified requirement.

2.2 Scope

The Requirement Analysis Stage for Release 3 of the IMPACT Programme has been partitioned to
front-end Branch Trading and back-end aspects of the requirement.

This document concerns the provision of revised Branch Trading processes at post office branches and
Post Office central facilities that are to be supported via Horizon. as part of the IMPACT Release 3
Programme. The document defines Post Office requirements for these revised processes.

Post Office requirements for IMPACT Release 3 relating to back-end processes are defined in the
companion document entitled PO Ltd Financial Systems Release 3 Conceptual Design (Post Office
ref. PSO/IND/E2E/STR/023)

2.2.1 Exclusions

None

2.3. Background

This document has been produced by Post Office Ltd with the assistance of Fujitsu Services and Prism
Alliance.

The IMPACT business case authorised by Post Office resulted from a Feasibility Study that evaluated
opportunities for simplifying Post Office end-to-end processes throughout the business. The programme
was formerly known as the End-to-End (E2E Programme). The business changes that are to be
introduced by the IMPACT Programme are to be delivered in three stages that have been aligned with
Horizon releases S60 (Release 1), S70 (Release 2) and S80 (Release 3).

This document is produced as part of the Requirements Analysis stage of Release 3 of the IMPACT
Programme.

2.4 Document Explanations

2.4.1 Creation Process

Details of the Business Proposition and Requirements have been provided by representatives of the Post
Office™ Business Sponsor, Product Deployment Representative and the Business Architecture
Representative.

The High Level End-to-End Solution Architecture and Architecture principles have been provided by the

Post Office™ Technical Architect, who has also supplied the Technical Requirements, Supplier Domains
and the required Supplier Deliverables.

2.4.2 Business Process Models

Post Office's functional requirements are represented in the form of Process models using Process
objects and supporting descriptions and information flow definitions. The tool used for creating these
Process Models is Popkin Systems Architect The models have been created according to the IDEFO
modelling standard. An example of the high level process map for the Branch Trading aspects of the
Programme is shown below.

Accounts and Settlement [IDEFO]

The example depicts a number of process boxes and related information flows. Where appropriate, each
process box has been decomposed to a lower level process as part of the IMPACT Release 3
Requirement Analysis activities and are described within this document. Systems Architect has also been
used to capture and manage the inter-dependencies between processes from which the data attributes
required to create systems interfaces will be derived.

Boxes depicted in red are part of the overall process but deemed out of scope for this particular part of the
IMPACT design.

Boxes depicted in black are processes which needed to be shown because of their relationship but are
delivered elsewhere eg. Royal Mail Group

These requirements together with the non-functional requirements are also represented as individual
statements to enable compliance and acceptance processes to verify that the delivered solution meets the
Post Office requirements. Each requirement is individually numbered using the following syntax: -

3 Overview

3.1 Business Proposition

The Accounting and Cash Management Programme Conceptual Design [CR/CDE/006] identified a
number of areas for the business proposition of the programme of which only some will be achieved by the
completion of this project. The business proposition section of the programme is copied below (Section
3.1.1 in this document is copied as section 3.3 from the programme CD). These aims of the programme
were considered to develop the principles identified in Section 3.2.1 to scope this project.

3.1.1. Accounting, Reconciliation and Settlement, including Debt Recovery and Branch

Control

3.1.1.1 Scope
Interface of data to RMG financial systems (including for data passed to HR-SAP)
Management of PO Ltd Bank Accounts

Capture, Validation, Verification and Correction of client transaction data from any channel where
applicable

@ Provision of validated client transaction data to internal and external recipients (though some of this is
done via POL FS and MI

Responding to client/branch enquiries conceming transaction data (Enquiries to allow response)
Accounting at branches

Branch control

Recovering debt from branches, clients etc (inc non-transaction) debt

ecee

3.1.1.2 Key Priorities

Make the identification of debt easier

Reduce the amount of reconciliation required

Increase the amount of debt recovered

Put the emphasis on clients and customers to validate the data
Simplify branch processes by reducing the amount of paper
Centralise/consolidate agents debt

Enable matching of cash at branches with settlement with client

3.1.1.3. Business Drivers/issues
e@ Re-focus on Debt Recovery (financial recovery of money), target 95%
© Only 10% of discrepancies are actually debt
e Establish a central debt monitoring environment to enable the identification of debt with a high
degree of accuracy.
To report Business and Client information separately and accurately.
To increase accounting control in branches
Alignment of management and accounting information
Establish an appropriate and flexible accounting hierarchy
Performance measures of throughputs and the actual financial debt.
Rationalise systems in place to report client and business information.
To modify the method of recovering debt e.g. using payroll for agents.

——________e___ Enable proper accounting of cash and stock

Improve timing, accuracy, granularity and summarisation levels.
Avoidance of losses from remittances and client settlement
Accounting and settlement on our data, not clients

Manual journal documents and human intervention produce errors
Accounting period alignment — branch Wednesday, business Sunday.
Settlement estimating can produce positive or negative interest position

Cash centre accounting is manual, weekly, therefore no through view from transaction to
settlement.

3.2.1. Overview

The specification of the requirement detailed in this document, including the descriptions of the new
Branch Trading processes, where relevant and practical, have taken the following principles into account:

1. Flexibility should be provided for each Branch to manage their own affairs to fit with local requirements, subject
to the retention of appropriate Post Office retail line and business monitoring and control measures.

2. The balancing of Stock Units at the branch, for the purposes of rolling-over to a new trading period, should take
place on a monthly basis, instead of the current weekly process. Prior to completing the monthly balance, all
discrepancies should be brought to account and all business settled. There should be flexibility within the
balancing period to manage local branch affairs, including more frequent “interim” balancing if required at a
local level. There should also be the opportunity to compare and/or balance, on a daily basis, the Horizon
generated cash figure against physical cash held at the Branch (See 4).

Management and Control and
COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Transaction Management

As indicated in principle 2 above, the branch trading period should be 4 weeks. It is intended that the branch
balance period should continue to end on a Wednesday. This schedule should be arranged to optimise the
phasing of central support requirement for branch processes. This may mean that the schedules for branches
may be offset, i.e. groups of branches will have different balancing schedules to smooth the support
requirements.

To support local branch management processes, there is a continuing requirement to declare physical cash
holdings on a daily basis. Improved local branch reporting should be provided to cover individual Stock Unit
positions and the overall branch position regarding:

Q_ The Horizon generated cash position
Q_ The cash position declared by branch office staff
Q Any +/- variance between the generated and declared positions

This information should be provided to support local branch management and is not incorporated in
central accounts.

At the end of each branch trading period (which will end on a Wednesday mid-month (on a 4-4-5 week basis),
local branch management should be required to produce a Branch Trading Statement that will be comprised of:

Q~ asimple summary of business aligned to the trading period that is expected to be printed on one
A4 sheet of paper

Q asummary of the branch stock in hand position reporting stock volumes held.

The statement should be generated, signed and retained at the branch to be available to support
branch and retail line management processes. Horizon should notify Post Office central systems when
the production of the statement has been completed at the branch. The Branch Trading Statement
should report on the branch trading position at the end of each trading period once all Stock Units have
been balanced and rolled-over to the next trading period. Completion of the statement should require
confirmation by the local branch management that position reported represents an accurate account of
the branch position. Confirmation should be evidenced by production of a signed copy of the
statement that should be retained at the branch. There is not a requirement to forward an electronic
version of the statement to Post Office central systems.

It should be possible to obtain a report on a branch’s trading position at any time within a trading period
to help support effective branch management and retail line monitoring and control.

It is an objective to reduce requirements to produce daily and weekly reports at the branch to those required to
support mandatory daily despatch processes, and to introduce greater flexibility for reporting and despatch
requirements for all items that are not time critical and do not have to be despatched daily. Consideration
should be given to aligning reporting requirements with the differing business needs of the various branch types,
e.g. it may be practical for Directly Managed Branches to continue to despatch weekly whilst Rural Branches
despatch monthly. The ideal future state would be that daily despatch should be restricted to time critical items
such as cheques, application forms, etc only. It is recognised that the extent to which this principle can be
realised by IMPACT will be constrained by client requirements and it is therefore recommended that it is carried
forward for further consideration and action by the Post Office Sales & Marketing Product Re-Engineering
Programme.

Processes concerned with checking and confirming stock holdings at the branch should be aligned to the
monthly trading period. The completion of these processes should be a mandatory part of the process
responsible for producing the end of period Branch Trading Statement.

Stock in hand held at the branch should be reported and managed by volume and not value until sold or there is
reason to adjust the stock in hand figure, e.g. following detection of lost stock. When stock is sold or adjusted,
the associated transaction will include the value of the sale or adjustment and this value will be reflected in the
branch trading position and reflected in Post Office ledgers. The unit of measure for all stock reporting on
Horizon will be the retail sales unit of measure, i.e. the units in which the stock is sold.

. The existing differentiation between value and non value stock within Horizon should be removed. It is

proposed that all stock handled by Horizon should be controlled, i.e. stock deliveries/dispatches to the branch
should be remmed in and out.

. Within the monthly trading period, branches should have facilities to identify and the flexibility to manage local

variances between system generated and actual cash holding positions , in line with Principle 1 above.. These
variances will be identified through one of three mechanisms:

Q  Acash declaration

Q = Astock declaration

Q Balancing the SU

All local variances identified at the branch must be actioned within the monthly trading period, i.e.
Stock Units should not be allowed to roll-over at trading period end with an outstanding local variance.
Prior to balancing the Stock Unit at period end, any outstanding variances should be forwarded to the
branch manager/supervisor’s Stock Unit as local suspense items that should be addressed locally at
branch level before the branch rolls over into the next trading period.

12. By the end of a monthly trading period, branches should be required to make good discrepancies between
Horizon generated cash and stock positions and the actual physical position determined by branch office staff.
To help facilitate this, existing Horizon facilities that permit branch staff to post cash discrepancies to a cash
suspense account will be removed. Remaining branch suspense accounts should only be used following prior
authorisation via Post Office central processes and will be restricted to use by branch staff with Horizon
manager/supervisor roles.

Suspense values can be cleared in several ways, namely through:
Q Cash made good

Q Transaction Corrections forwarded to the branch via POL FS (previously known in their manual
form as Error Notices) which create pre-defined transaction to clear suspense and move to the
authorised product line

Q = Arrangement made for subpostmaster to pay via salary or credit card (handled via Transaction
Corrections)

Q DMB reverse suspense item to clear value into central write off (posting should be handled via a
new Horizon transaction)

This principle would remove the requirement for the use of vouchers to move losses into the centre.
Consideration should be given to the use of this facility to replace the need for paper vouchers that are
currently used in conjunction with TP to handle requirements such as re-imbursement for postage
costs.

13. Central accounting and control functions should operate from information based on the daily transaction stream
delivered from the branch.

14. Reference data should be implemented more robustly to optimise the use of validation and range checks that
are applied against transactions at the point of sale in the branch, helping to simplify existing central control
processes. The objective is to identify potential errors more quickly, reduce discrepancies and improve the
accuracy of branch accounting without introducing increases in main path Branch activities.

15. The capture of bulk data should not be linked to the production of the trading account and should be
addressed, where practical, by daily processes to facilitate timely inclusion in Post Office ledgers.

16. The capture of non accounting data should not be linked to the production of the trading account and should be
addressed, where practical, by periodic processes for data capture.

17. Additional data currently captured manually at the time of a transaction should, where practical, be captured
and electronically reported via Horizon. It is recognised that the extent to which this principle can be realised by
IMPACT may be constrained by client requirements and it is therefore recommended that it is carried forward
for further consideration and action by the Post Office Sales & Marketing Product Re-Engineering Programme.

18. The manual Error Notice based process currently operated to handle variances identified centrally or at the
branch should be automated using a Transaction Correction handling process controlled centrally via POL FS
to help facilitate the clearing of discrepancies within a Branch Trading Statement period.

19. An enhanced Sales Report should be available to Branches to enable review of sales activities over a user
specified period. For example, Agents should be able to produce a sales report covering a calendar month to
help estimate their expected remuneration for the period. It is recognised that any such estimate would only be
for guidance and would represent an approximation of the Agent entitlement.

20. It should not be possible to complete the production of the period end Branch Trading Statement until all items
covered by dockets (e.g. Redeemed Savings Stamped, Redeemed Postal Orders, encashed benefit foils)
have been cleared. This principle applies to items such as cheques, and consideration should be given to
opportunities to automate the whole associated process, including cut off, dispatch and zeroing of volumes held
on Horizon.

21. Consideration should be given to the introduction of improved processes that enable the removal of the need
for using manual vouchers and error notices through the use of Transaction Corrections together additional
automation support.

3.4 Potential for Change

The design of the solution to these requirements should be based on a generic approach which will allow

future additions to the functionality.

At the time of writing the most significant changes being considered by the business, that may have an

impact on this requirement are:

« Movement of central handling of stock of Foreign Exchange products from Hemel Hempstead
stock centre to handling via Cash Centres, and any consequential requirements to manage
Foreign Exchange stock like Cash.

* Implementation of a new stock management system within the Hemel Hempstead stock

centre.

6 Functional Requirements

In order to analyse and assess the functional requirements across the scope of this project the following areas were
identified and analysed separately, initially, and then as a whole. The findings of the overall study are summarised
here by these area groupings for ease of reading.

6.1 Overview —- Local Verification

The main purpose of the Local Verification function is to ensure the quality of the data being captured within Horizon
by the Branch. This is to ensure that it reflects reality and is sufficient to feed the subsequent processing based
upon it. This is an important part of the overall Branch Trading design, and has allowed other changes such as
monthly account.
The three main functions within this area are:

« — to validate the data captured, at the point of capture to ensure that the data is as accurate as possible

to perform range checks on reported data, at a summary or sample level, to highlight areas for further

investigation and potential corrective action

* to reconcile the data with other available sources i.e. client data.
The requirements discussions agreed Horizon currently has the functionality to verify data entered at the branch.
The only change required will be to the ranges specified through reference data. This will then meet the objectives
of controlling the quality of data captured at the branch.
It was agreed that functionality to perform range checks on data were not required at the branch. These will be
provided by Management Information type reporting systems, which are not within the scope of this part of the
IMPACT programme.
Much of this function currently takes place within Transaction Processing, so by moving these checks earlier in the
chain, this should pro actively eliminate the errors. This will also reduce processing work throughout POL.
A review of system-based reconciliations has been made to identify those that support business requirements for
managing data accuracy, and thus must be reproduced in new/enhanced systems, and those that can be
eliminated by system redesign.
MacDonaldD2 Sounds as though this requirement will be met by tightening existing capability and is not really within
the scope of Impact. If this is so, suggest it is removed from the CD for clarity.

6.2 Overview — Other Data Capture

The purpose of the functions within Other Data Capture are to ensure that as much of the data that is captured at
the Branch is communicated in the most efficient and effective manner. This will involve more data being
transmitted electronically to recipients, for example POL Clients. This will also meet the programme objectives of
simplifying the work required at the Branch.

The three main functions identified within this functional area are:

« to input non-accounting data, which is data regarding levels and proportions of various classes of
transaction. This data does not have a financial effect but is required for further processing, often related to
remuneration;

« to input bulk data, which is data generated from transactions that have been carried out through
mechanisms other than Horizon terminals within branches, including Lotto terminals and ATMs;

« to capture additional data related to customer transactions which must be reported to the client, but which
is currently captured manually at the point of transaction for example.

The requirements discussions concluded that the existing facilities for entering non-accounting and bulk data within
the Horizon system will continue to meet the requirements to capturing such data.

The requirements analysis also identified opportunities, within the procedures for administering various products, to
capture customer data at the point of transaction and reduce the post transaction processing of this data. However,
it has been recognised that changing these procedures would require negotiations with the clients. As such this is
best altered as part of the Product Re-engineering programme currently being implemented within Post Office Ltd.
In spite of this being out of scope, the opportunities have been identified, and these have been taken into account
when designing a generic Branch Trading process. Following further business as usual product re-engineering
work, this should release additional benefits for POL.

MacDonaldD2 Again out of scope so suggest removing

6.3 Overview — Produce Reports

This functional area has the purpose of producing various reports from the data captured within Horizon. This
allows data to be communicated directly from the branch to various sources. As part of the requirements analysis,

3 March 2004 Version 1.0 Page 21 of 120

© Post Office™ 2004
FUJ00089971

FUJ00089971
Doc Ref: BTRMC&TM-001 Conceptual Design Project: IMPACT - Branch Trading Reporting,
Management and Control and
COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE. Transaction Management

the various product summaries that are produced on a daily or periodic (usually weekly) basis have been reviewed.
Opportunities to eliminate the production of some of these summaries have been identified, though it has been
recognised that such elimination would require negotiations with the POL clients. Again, this is part of the Product
Re-engineering programme. Again, in spite of this being out of scope, this has been taken into account when
designing the Branch Trading process, so additional benefits can be realised for POL. Where it has been possible
to remove manual summaries and replace them with ones from Horizon, this has been taken.

This analysis considered requirements for improved control over dockets sent from the branch and identified that
this would return little benefit over the existing cut-off mechanisms, which it was decided would remain unchanged.
The analysis has also reviewed the content of other reports produced at the branch and revised the content of some
of these reports to enhance the information they provide.

MacDonaldD2 Needs to be confined to whatever is deemed in scope for Impact

6.4 Overview — Daily Trading

The purpose of these functions is to support the Branch Managers in performing a regular (probably daily) set of
processes to give them the information and controls to adequately manage their business. In reviewing this area the
requirements study identified benefits from utilising the current daily cash declaration process. The cash declaration
data compared to the system generated figures for cash, can be used as an indicator as to the likely state of
balance within the Branch. This is based on the assumption that a cash variance/discrepancy would be the first and
best place to identify a potential error.

The variances won't be reported centrally because they are local pieces of information, for the Branch to deal with.
It was agreed that to report, monitor and control these would be too large a scale exercise for it to be beneficial. In
particular because the variances will be available for every Stock Unit. This report should be used as a flexible tool
for Branches to make the best use to manage themselves on a day to day basis. This is particularly relevant within
a longer trading period.

The requirements discussions identified requirements for a new report to be produced by the Horizon system, the
Cash Variance Report. This report will summarise by day and by stock unit the following data for the Branch
Manager:

« the system generated cash holdings
the declared cash holdings, if made (indication will be shown when cash was not declared)
any variances between these figures
any values held in suspense
the numbers of any outstanding Transactions Corrections (correction actions generated from the Post
Office Ltd. accounts system).

eo eee

This report will be produced and retained within the Branch, but can be reviewed by the Retail Line Manager
and/or Auditors on visits. Again, these roles will view the report as an indicator as to whether or not the Branch
Manager is effectively using the managerial controls available.

6.5 Overview — Produce Branch Accounts

This area of functions has the purpose of providing all of the mechanisms for the branch to produce a balanced set
of accounts, which accurately reflect the result of all of the trading for the period. The requirements discussions
agreed to move Branches from settling their accounts on a weekly basis, to a monthly basis. This recognises that
the creation of regular Cash Variance Reports should provide the Branch Manager with the ability to manage the
Branch on a day to day basis, within this extended period. It will also give an early indication of any potential errors
in the accounts. Existing mechanisms to correct such errors will be available to be used within the accounting
period (i.e. the Branch Manager will not have to wait till the end of the accounting period to make such corrections).
With the data quality (verification) work discussed above, this should improve the transaction stream of data,
potentially reduce errors, and hence simplify the overall branch trading (accounting) process.

The new Post Office Ltd accounting system (POL-Financial System (POL-FS)) will base its information directly on
the daily stream of Transaction Data being provided by Horizon, rather than the current Cash Account summaries.
There will no longer be a requirement for the branch accounts to be posted into the Post Office Ltd. Accounts
systems.

A requirement will remain for branch accounts to be produced and on a regular basis (monthly on a Wednesday,
mid-month, on a 4-4-5 week basis) but they will be produced for local accounting purposes and so will be retained
within the branch. Requirements were agreed to support the management of conformance to these requirements,
by reporting the production (and non-production) of branch accounts to the Management Information system(s).

Doc Ref: BTRMC&TM-001 Conceptual Design Project: IMPACT - Branch Trading Reporting,
Management and Control and
COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE. Transaction Management

The analysis has also devised a new branch accounts report (Trading Statement Report) to ensure that it displays
the required accounting information that the Branch Manager needs in a simpler more summarised format The
design has retained elements of the current balancing and accounting process which are simple and understood,
but has attempted to rationalise processes to a degree. There has also been a separation of processes where
there is no strict requirement for them to be finalised together. This should mean a more streamlined process, both
daily and weekly.

6.6 Overview — Stock Control

This area identifies a group of functions that support the control of stock around the Post Office Ltd. business. In
branch trading terms the functions have the purpose of providing appropriate information as to movements of stock
items within the branch, whether through delivery (rem in or out), sale or adjustment. The overall purpose of the
Stock Control function is to ensure that the business has visibility of its stock holdings across the Post Office
Network, to accurately account for that stock which is held on the balance sheet,and to effectively control all stock
(whether balance sheet stock or not).

It has been agreed to remove the notions of value and non value stock, and just have Stock. This will bring effective
system control to managing stock, and to remove the reporting of stock by value within the branch accounts and
reports. In Branches stock will only be associated with a value when it is sold or adjusted, value indicated stamps
are a notable exception to this. This will remove the need for stock revaluations.

6.7 Overview — Discrepancy Management

This area of functions has the purpose of providing mechanisms to make adjustments to branch accounts, to
correct errors and ensure Branch accounts align with the Post Office Ltd. Accounts within POL-FS. Various
mechanisms are available to identify errors that require adjustments, and the discrepancy management functions
may be initiated from various places across the business. The main areas will be from within the Branch, from POL
Clients or centrally via distributing electronic transaction corrections. These corrections will replace the current error
notice processes and should not involve any manual paperwork or processing. They will be received and actioned
via Horizon, and will be distributed more quickly, potentially only days after an error is recorded.

The analysis has also identified requirements to more tightly control and police the use of the suspense account
within the branch accounts, only a limited subset of the existing suspense account products will be retained. The
contractual requirements for branch managers to make good unknown errors in branch accounts will be used
instead.

6.8 Overview — Transaction Management

This functional area has the purpose of summarising the data regarding transactions to the appropriate levels for
onward communications to the central systems

The requirements discussions have identified the needs to support the various data feeds currently fed into, and out
of, OPtip and CBDB and to identify mechanisms for the acceptance, and delivery, of the information on those feeds
by the replacement systems.

In doing this the analysis has identified all opportunities to eliminate future development and testing costs, within the
transaction management systems.

7 Exclusions

A number of facilities or implementation methods are described in the overall requirements analysis. Post
Office confirms that that the following items are not required in the Branch Trading Reporting,
Management and Control and Transaction Management solution: -

Comment

Management Information

Itis confirmed that reporting of management information
across transaction data, identifying trends and providing
mechanisms to analyse transactional data is excluded from
the scope of these requirements.

Product Re-engineering

It is confirmed that, though many of the benefits sought
through elimination of off-system data capture and reporting
could be achieved by changing the way that this data is
captured (on-system), that such changes are out of scope
of these requirements. Since such changes would require
negotiations with the clients for which these product are sold
and so would best be altered as part of the Product Re-
engineering programme.

Description

Description

This process entails automated reconciliation of data streams within the
Fujitsu domain. Current examples of this are the Banking DRS
reconciliation and APS to TPS reconciliation. It is suggested that the future
process remain as current although the changes to the TMS domain may
have implications on the current process.

Trigger

Receipts of electronic files as described below.

Automation

There are a number of areas for potential reconciliation checks:

¢ Between the Branch and TMS

« Between APS Transactions sent to Clients and Transaction

Summaries passed to POL FS
¢ Between Financial Institutes views of on-line Transactions and the
Branch / TMS's view

«Integrity of individual data flows
Proposed reconciliation mechanisms in these areas are discussed below.
Between the Branch and TMS
There is a potential danger in that messages harvested from that Branch
and the summaries might not match. This is currently addressed, by
generating a “reconciliation total” at the branch and checking that all
harvested transactions at the Data Centre match this total.
In addition, the POL FS interface will check that all Summaries passed to it
add up to zero, thus ensuring that no summaries are missing.
It is proposed that such reconciliation checking is sufficient.
Between APS Transactions and Summaries
It is proposed that transactions are harvested once to TMS rather than
separately for OpTIP and AP Clients. This means that the set of
Transactions summarised for TMS and those passed to the AP Clients will
be the same (section 0 describes the checks that the transactions match
the summaries passed to POL FS).
Note that Transactions are not necessarily passed to the AP clients on the
day that they are received by TMS, however the CTS file will account for
any differences in this.
It is proposed that the existing reconciliation between TPS and APS is
removed thus simplifying the TMS processing.

Between FI and TMS view of on-line Transactions

It is proposed that the current 3 way reconciliation carried out by DRS
between the Fis view, the real-time transaction flow from the Branch and
the EOD flow (which in turn is matched to the summaries passed to POL
FS) is retained as it is.

Integrity of individual data flows

All File interfaces will ensure that they include appropriate Trailer records

which contain totals of financial data within the file, thus ensuring that any

Description

Description

Enhance the transaction data stream with data required within the
transaction data for particular clients/products.

Additional client data in this context refers to the current
process whereby additional data fields relating to transactions,
that re not captured within Horizon, are captured using the
manual summaries within the branch.

Process drivers for capture of additional data items are:
= Contractual requirements with clients
= Validation of settlement figures (specific evidence)
= — Responding to customer and client enquiries
= Investigating exceptions/discrepancies

Product re-engineering has been defined as out of scope, but ADC and
PAF functionality could be utilised by applying NRDS functionality.

It is therefore suggested that for transactions where evidence is provided,
details are then recorded and the evidence is returned to the customer —
these details could be captured using Horizon ADC and PAF functionality at
the point of transaction capture driven by NRDS. This would result in no
additional work for the branch as they will effectively replace the manual
recording of information on paper summaries for these products and enter
the details directly into Horizon.

This process would result in the following benefits:

e Removal of some of the current manual processes within the
branch

e Allow validation rules to be applied to the additional data capture
fields

* Allow data to be sent electronically direct to the client

« Remove the need for some additional work and legacy systems
within the centre

Where we are keeping supporting documents, currently various activities
may be undertaken within the centre for these. For example they may be
keyed into a legacy system and then matched against client transaction
data. As matching will not take place in the future, the supporting
documents could be despatched direct to the client. The client would then
be responsible for customer enquiries and would also need to provide
evidence when raising queries. There would be a dependency on Sales
and marketing to agree the relevant changes with the affected Clients to
enable us to do this.

Trigger

Transaction will be user inifiated, trigger for additional data capture items
will be driven by parameters defined within NRDS

Automation

Relevant data items for additional data capture will be prompted by the
system and verification rules applied as defined within NRDS (mandatory
business rules)

Changes to be designed and implemented by the Product Re-engineering
Programme. No changes are required within this project.

Current process and functionality for such data entry are to be retained as a
result of this project.

Frequency

At a transaction level as frequently as the need arises for the capture of
additional data items

engineering and undertake contractual negotiations with clients

Description

Description

This process allows for action to be taken on the cash or stock variances
highlighted at stock unit level. Any variance identified for any reason other than the
limited number of known error reasons (see below) must be made good before
the stock unit can balance, though when the stock unit is not the last to balance
discrepancies can be transferred to another stock unit as part of balancing.

Taking this action to correct the stock of Physical Cash for the stock unit is to be
informed to the Horizon system which should record that this action has been
taken.

A Branch Trading Statement can not be finalised for a trading period (although it
will be possible to roll over a balance period) until all variances are made good.
(Note that this is different from the current process where making good must take
place in the next period.)

Trigger

This is a user driven process

Automation

It is proposed that two new “buttons” are introduced onto the Horizon system:
* Make good a loss

« Remove excess cash

Detailed design will decide where these buttons will be added to the system. These
buttons will be available for any clerk to record the “making good” event. Such
“make good” events will be recorded in the audit trail. The last cash declaration for
the Stock Unit would also be updated to record that the value of cash declared has
now been corrected by the amount made good.

Directly Managed branches don't make good, instead Button to move variances to

It should be noted that, there are consequences of the principle:

's that “Stock will be held by

sales unit of measure.” and that “All products will be remmed in and
excluded.” , which have some far reaching implications. These are:

¢ The principles don't fit with the detailed requirements for the handling of stamps. It has been agreed

that “Other Stamps” will need to be managed by Value rather than by

Volume.

There is a consequential requirement to convert all current non-value stock to Value Stock, in order to
bring them under system reported control. Stocks of Motor Vehicle Licenses (MVLs) will be controlled

in a way that movements (including remittances in, sales, stock adjus'

stments and remittances out) of all

MVLs of different types (months) will be reported to POL-FS as a summation of movements for all the

different types (months).This means that the stock control system

within POL-FS will have only a

combined total of all MVLs within the branch. Requirements for any further information for other
purposes (e.g. requirements planning) will be reviewed and implemented under another stock control

adjustment transaction for the amount of the difference — by volume. In shared
stock units an alternative approach is for all parts of the stock unit to perform a
blind declaration of stock, part declarations are summed up and the overall
declaration investigated by reviewing discrepancies or producing a trial balance.
Stock adjustments will result in corresponding changes to the system generated
cash level. Declarations resulting in Discrepancies will result in an automated Cash
Discrepancy being recorded rather than adjusting the system generated cash level.
For “Other Stamps” (special stamps and 1st & 2nd class are currently handled as
Stock) the user will be presented with a screen against which he can key in the
quantities of stock items for each denomination of stamp that he has. On
completion the system will compare this with the system calculated sales value for
Stamps, any differences will then automatically, on request of a trial balance,
create an adjustment transaction to reflect the difference as a cash discrepancy.
For Foreign Currency and Travellers Cheques a declaration will be entered into a
screen by currency for the amount held, in the foreign currency. (i.e. as at present)
All of the above is current process and functionality for stock checking on the

stock volumes held figures.

Trigger The process should follow on directly from the Trial Balance process.

Automation The user will select the appropriate function, the system will rollover the stock unit

into the next balance period or trading statement period (chosen by the user) and
produce a report which he/she can check, sign and store.

As part of the Stock Unit Trial Balance process, any variances between Declared
figures and Systems Generated figures will be recorded as Discrepancies (as at
present). However a new check is to be introduced after producing the Trial
Balance (ie when the “rollover” button is pressed prior to producing the Final

1. If it isn’t the last Stock Unit to rollover, the clerk will be advised that the
Discrepancy is to be posted to a “local adjustments” account. They have
the option of accepting or rejecting this action.

a. Should they accept it, then a pair of transactions will be
generated resulting in the Discrepancy being reduced to zero and
a corresponding amount being put into a ‘local adjustments
product”.

b. Should they reject it, then the rollover is aborted and the clerk is
free to do whatever they wish to balance the Stock Unit and will
then need to balance the Stock Unit again at a later time.

c. The “local adjustment” is not associated with any Stock Unit (as
with a Suspense account). Items can be added to it by any clerk,
but only as part of the Balancing Process. Managers /
Supervisors will be able to move items from it into cash in their
SU to be Made Good.

2. If this is the last Stock Unit to Rollover an additional check will be
performed to ensure that the net total of transactions, within the Trading
Period, in the “local adjustment” account has a net value of zero.

3. If this is the last Stock Unit to Rollover, then the user will be informed if the
Stock Unit has a Discrepancy and that this must be resolved before the
last Stock Unit can be rolled over.

Local Adjustment will behave in a similar way to existing Suspense Account items,
namely the values will not be associated with any Stock Unit, but is considered as
part of the overall Branch balance.

There is an existing report that shows the state of all suspense accounts and all
Transactions associated with the suspense accounts during the Trading Period,
indicating which Stock Unit carried out the Transaction. It is proposed that Local
Adjustment transactions are included in this report as with any other Suspense
transactions — the only difference being that a Branch Rollover will not be permitted
if the carried forward figure for the Local Adjustment Account is non-zero.

Since this is a Local Adjustments item, it is assumed that there is no need for any
movements into and out of it to be visible centrally (ie to POL FS) and any values
held in it should be considered as part of the Branch’s Cash Holding.

Note it is understood that Horizon should be changed such that only Supervisors
and Managers (etc) will be allowed to carry out Suspense Transactions. The only
exception to this will be the automatic posting of Discrepancies to Local

Adjustment.

Frequency Potentially daily, more likely weekly but definitely monthly.

Constraints Existing constraints: All relevant declarations (cash, stamps, bureau cash, bureau
travellers cheques) made, all mandatory reports produced, if last SU to balance
then Parcel Traffic Report produced.

New constraints: all dockets and vouchers have been remmed out (i.e. no stock of

10.2 Business Data
10.2.1 Business Data Model

The Conceptual Design Product Description requires that a Business Data Model is included in this section. The
model will be created in System Architect and is to show the logical model for the data that will be used in the
physical design. The model will be a subset of the POL Corporate Data Model and be integrated with the POL
master model repository. The model will be generated from a function/ activity to entity matrix captured in System
Architect, which is to reference the Process Models developed during the Branch Trading workshops. The ‘first cut’
data model should be verified with the business representatives to ensure that the business rules and logic
embodied within it are appropriate to the solution.

MacDonaldD2 Any chance of including this data model in the CD ?

NRDS to be the only source of Types A and B reference data to Horizon domain. Type A reference data is

11 Non-Functional Requirements

This section describes the non-functional characteristics that the Impact Programme and its supporting
infrastructure must support. These include volumes, service and support management and failure
recover and training.

11.1 Volumetrics

The volumes to be supported are specified in the Application Interface Specifications

11.2Sizing Assumptions
The following assumptions are to be made when assessing the impact of the Branch Trading facilities:-

= There will be no significant changes to the numbers of Transactions taking place within the branch
=" The data retention period will be increased such that all trading data is available within the Branch for
a minimum of 42 days. Note that this will have implications on the central data storage requirements.
MacDonaldD2 The accounting period is increased from 7 to a maximum of 35 days so is increasing data retention
to 42 realistic. Does it need to potentially be much higher ?

= Summaries of all Transactions that take place in a branch need to be passed to POL FS on a daily
basis.

= Summaries of all Transactions that take place in a branch need to be passed to HR SAP on a monthly
basis.

= The size of each file is defined in the respective interface documentation (AIS)

11.3 Service Levels

Reviews of this service will be held at agreed intervals, typically monthly. The review will be attended by
the service managers from POL and Fujitsu Services, together with appropriate operational and technical
managers. The review will consider the service performance against the OLA and SLA; the impact of any
forecast service changes; open problems and any service improvements.

Availability
The new solution should be consistent with the current service levels as set out in {REF SLA}.

Reliability
The new solution should be consistent with the current service levels as set out in {REF SLA}.

Data Delivery Times
It is envisaged that the data delivery times will align with current LFS delivery times, although needs to be
confirmed.

Help desks
Helpdesk support for issues between Horizon / SAPADS will be required as outlined in the current LFS
OLA (appendix A)

Helpdesk support between Horizon / POL FS will need to be agreed.

Service level reports
Service Level reports should be produced in line with current LFS reports, and should be discussed as part
of the current Logistics feeder service, operational review forum.

NB The resulting solution should not significantly impact the run times of the current batch process, and
Current operational achievements should still be met

16 Acceptance

Acceptance takes place upon determining that the solution is fit for purpose. Acceptance for each
Requirement will be conducted by one or more of the following methods: -

« 1. Supplier Test

o This method will comprise tests that are run and managed by Suppliers. The method
of testing will be specified in the IMPACT R3 test plans, and the mapping of each
Requirement to one or more test cases will be managed by Suppliers. The
assessment of these tests will be by inspection of test results carried out by
Suppliers or jointly with Post Office.

¢ 2. Document review
o This method will comprise a document review by Post Office Ltd. of the relevant
section of a document or documents. The classification and contractual status of
any documents used for this purpose will remain unchanged.

* 3. Post Office Test

co This method will comprise tests that are run and managed by Post Office Ltd. The
actual method of testing, which may utilise the Post Office Ltd. End-to-End test
environment, will typically be used for those aspects of the solution that can only be
verified as part of an overall Post Office End-to-End environment. The Post Office
Test could also include document review.

« 4. Statement of fact or obligation
0 This classification will be used for those Requirements that represent an existing
Fujitsu Services obligation, or where the solution to a Requirement is self-evident
and does not lend itself to formal proving.
« 5. Not part of Supplier Acceptance
o This classification will be used against Requirements that are not part of Post Office
Ltd’s acceptance activities.

The Acceptance Method for each Requirement is indicated against it in Appendix A

17 Testing
Refer to Testing CCD VI/STR/064

NB: E2E references within this section refer to end-to-end (E2E) testing and not the E2E Programme
(former name for IMPACT).

17.1.1 Testing Statement
The testing plan will be based around the following PO Ltd testing statement
Testing will be able to confirm the acceptance criteria for some requirements have been met during the
various test phases. The criteria and the targeted test phase for the requirements statements (as detailed
in this section) will be added at a subsequent release of this document. The testability of the acceptance
criteria should be assessed by the testing team during the Requirements reviews.

An appropriate Test Strategy will be developed to reflect the release contents.

This will include some or all of the following testing phases.

Internal Functional Testing

Gaining assurance of main suppliers internal functional testing via :-
o Review suppliers internal test plans/ scripts for completeness
o Review suppliers internal test results / progress reports
o Review suppliers internal testing fault logs for impact

Non Functional Testing

Due to the nature of this type of testing the aim would be to achieve this via engagement with the supplier
in:-

Supplier document reviews

Review of supplier test plans / scripts for completeness

Witness specific key tests during a supplier testing cycle

Review supplier test results

Review supplier test fault logs for impact

00000

Interface Testing

Lead or Support Suppliers through the execution of Direct Interface testing between two suppliers e.g.
Lead Horizon to SAP/ADS

Review or develop and agree Interface scripts between two supplier domains

Support or co-ordinate set — up of test environments

Support or co-ordinate the provision of Required Ref. Data

Support or execute where appropriate the tests

Review the test results including any faults

00000

E2E Integration Testing

This phase is where POL would lead, supported by suppliers, in demonstrating the successful connection
of all the appropriate systems (test versions) in the releases E2E solution including carrying out some E2E
test transactions to confirm the readiness to enter the POL E2E functional testing cycles.

E2E Functional Testing

This phase is where POL would lead, supported by suppliers, in demonstrating through short “days in the
life of the POL business” cycles that the revised systems interact correctly in an E2E manner and with the
revised business process and procedures.

This is also to assure POL that the changes to current systems and the introduction of new systems has not
impacted upon the businesses operation including E2E financial aspects (accounting, reconciliation,
settlement, remuneration) have been and can maintained during live operation. E2E Management
Information is maintained or new information reflects the requirements and business needs.

Successful completion of this phase would lead to the introduction into the live environment via one or more
of the following:-

© a pre-pilot (transactions carried out in the passive Post Office)

o pilot (small number of outlets)

© go-live.( rolled out to the full estate)

Pre-Pilot

This final testing phase is whereby a “live” Post Office is used to test that the connectivity of the live E2E
systems has been achieved and that a small number of transactions representing the changes can be
carried out and report correctly in accounting and management information terms.

Completion of this final phase should be the point of hand-over to the Implementation team / phase.

18 Implementation & Migration

18.1 Migration Principles

The following principles define the overall migration approach:
Final Accounting CAP on Wednesday before end of final accounting period on CBDB
+All branches start to feed POL-FS on same trading day (i.e. the next day)
«Stock in hand and Suspense in hand migrates at day following final accounting CAP
*CBDB balances migrate to POL-FS completely as at the period end

18.1.1 Migration Timeline

The diagram below shows the major events within the migration.

This shows three separate phases during the migration process:

= A: This is the time from when the branch migrates to include support for the functionality described in
this CD until the final Cash Account that is to be processed by CBDB. The diagram shows that as being
23/3/05, however the exact date will be decided nearer the time. It is required to be a Wednesday
(since Cash Accounts change on a Wednesday) and it should also be the Wednesday immediately prior
to a Post Office Ltd Month End.

= B: This is the period when POL FS will be providing the central support for the Financial systems,
however the branches will still be operating most of the current processes

= C: This is when the braches switch to using Branch Trading statements rather than the current Cash
Accounts.

Other points to note from the diagram:
= During period B, the first time that the Summarisation process operates to pass data to POL FS, it is
necessary to ensure that the Opening Position is correctly passed across to POL FS. This Opening
Position should be based on the closing levels reported in the Final Cash Account sent to CBDB. All
transactions from the point at which the Final cash account was taken must be identified and their effect
passed to POL FS even if they took place in earlier Trading Days so that there are no Transactions not
accounted for in either CBDB or POL FS
= During period B there will still be cash account information coming from some branches (following non-
polling) which will need to be sent to CBDB. In order to support this, the existing interface to OPTIP will
need to be maintained during this period. Once all Final Cash Accounts have been sent through, it is
then possible to switch off the feed to OPTIP and to seule it with an enhanced data feed to MIS
itoring required? What about really late

= The switch from phase B to phase c need not take place at the same time in all branches. This will
allow the new processes to be piloted. A “soft launch” mechanism is required to enable the rolling over

of a Cash Account to result in the migration of Stock Units and the branch into the new way of working
(ie moving from phase B to phase C).

= CBDB will pass data to HR SAP covering the period up until the final Cash Account (ie the end of phase
A). This means that the first run of data from TMS to HR SAP will probably be nearly 2 months after the

move from Phase A to Phase B.

BT — 038 Fujitsu A new check is to be introduced after producing the Trial 183 ]
Services Balance (ie when the “rollover” button is pressed prior to I
producing the Final Balance). This check will act as follows: I
4. If it isn't the last Stock Unit to rollover, the clerk will be I
advised that the Discrepancy is to be posted to a “local I
adjustments” account. They have the option of I
I
accepting or rejecting this action. I
d. Should they accept it, then a pair of I
transactions will be generated resulting in the I
Discrepancy being reduced to zero and a I
corresponding amount being put into a “local I
I
adjustments product”. I
e. Should they reject it, then the rollover is I
aborted and the clerk is free to do whatever I
they wish to balance the Stock Unit and will I
then need to balance the Stock Unit again at a I
later time. I
f. The “local adjustment” is not associated with I
any Stock Unit (as with a Suspense account). I
Items can be added to it by any clerk, but only I
as part of the Balancing Process. Managers / I
I
Supervisors will be able to move items from it I
into cash in their SU to be Made Good. I
5. If this is the last Stock Unit to Rollover an additional I
check will be performed to ensure that the net total of I
transactions, within the Trading Period, in the “local I
adjustment” account has a net value of zero. I
I
6. If this is the last Stock Unit to Rollover, then the user will I
be informed if the Stock Unit has a Discrepancy and I
that this must be resolved before the last Stock Unit can I
be rolled over. I
I
Local Adjustment will behave in a similar way to existing I
Suspense Account items, namely the values will not be I
associated with any Stock Unit, but is considered as part of the I
overall Branch balance. I

carried out the Transaction. It is proposed that Local Adjustment I

The content within this report is unchanged by the IMPACT requirement though the period of reporting and thus the
information provided at the head of the report will be changed. The order in which things are presented is also likely
to change as a result of the changes to the accounting hierarchy resulting from the move to not holding stock by
value. In particular Stamps will be split into different parts of the report.

20.7 Trial Balance Report & Final Balance Report (Stock Unit Balance:
Report) & Office Balance Snapshot

These reports are the same apart from the headings and the values [ffelaleiies) below. Any value in the Nett
Discrepancies lines at the trial balance will, if nothing else is done, be adjusted to the Discrepancy Shortage
Transferred or Discrepancy Excess Transferred lines as part of moving from the Trial Blance to the Final Balance.
The Office Balance snapshot will differ, in the detail at the top and bottom of the report (for example it won't have
the EXAMINATION bit at the bottom) and in the reporting of discrepancies and variances transferred, depending
upon the state of the stock unit at the time of producing the report.

20.14Office Daily Revalued Product List & Counter Daily Revaluation
Session Slip

Since all stock items (which are subject to revaluation, other than Foreign Exchange which is subject to “continual”
revaluation) are held by volume there is only requirement to report which products are to have their price changed
imminently. Assume that the Counter Daily Revaluation Session Slip will be removed and that any functionality at
the counter will allow the production of the Office Daily Revalued Product List.

20.16 Office Weekly Suspense Account

This will need changing to handle the changes to suspense accounts and to include the Local “suspense” account
used to transfer variance out o stock units to enable them to balance.

20.17 Return Advice Note

This will need changing since it includes stock values

20.18Reports proposed to be deleted.

The following reports are considered no longer necessary with these other changes and so are proposed to be
deleted.

¢ Office Weekly Counters Revenue Schedule

* Declaration and Confirmation — Non-Value Stock

« Counter Daily Cash on Hand (there is a separate report for Cash Declaration which is nearly identical, and

it is just the cash Declaration report that we need to retain)
« Office Weekly Cash Flow(this is replaced by the Variance report)

20.19 Other reporting considerations

Though remaining unchanged in content and structure there are many more reports for which consideration
must be made in the move from the weekly cash account to the monthly Trading Period accounting cycle.
Business procedures will be developed to identify which of these should be produced on what periodicity.

It is recognised that those which re-produce transactions that have happened during the period will increase
in size, when produced for these longer periods. It is also recognised that the time taken to produce the
reports, for these longer periods, will increase whether they reproduce transaction details or summarise
them.

A number of reports can be re-printed at a later time, a review of which reports are required to be re-printed
in this way must be made. It is assumed that there are no requirements for reports to be re-printed for
periods outside of the period of data-retention periods previously defined.
