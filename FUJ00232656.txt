1 Introduction

1.1 Background and Purpose

There is a need to control the assignment of Peaks to maintenance releases in order to ensure the
following factors are considered:

e Severity - business impact and priority

e Development impact to the release

e Test impact to the release

e Deployment impact to the release

e Overall project impact (i.e., timeframes, cost, quality) to the release
« Overall risk to the success and business objectives of the release

¢ Cost of resolution versus workaround

This Terms of Reference establishes governance and process designed to ensure that the above factors
are duly considered before a Peak is formally included into the approved scope of maintenance content.

1.2 Scope

The scope of this document relates purely to Peaks intended for maintenance releases. Major Release
Peaks are dealt with by another forum (the QFP).

2 Governance

2.1 Business Impact Forum / Peak Targeting Forum

The Business Impact Forum (BIF) convenes primarily to agree if a Peak can be fixed and brought into
the Forum. The Peak Targeting Forum (PTF) convenes primarily to agree a target release for a Peak
brought into the Forum.

Any peak being routed to BIF or PTF needs an action placed on it.
The forum will consist of nominees from each required delivery team and the Peak initiator.

Mandatory attendance is from Release Management (Chair), Application Development, Counter
Development, Test, Test (SV&I), Integration, SSC, Service Delivery, MIS Infra Service Operations,
Problem Management and the initiator of the Peak to be discussed.

Mandatory attendance should also include a representative from HNS.

In the event of one of the usual mandatory attendees not being available, that team should be
represented by a suitable replacement nominee from their business area or by their manager. It is the
responsibility of the delegate to ensure that a replacement attends. If the Peak initiator is unavailable to
discuss the Peak then a suitable replacement nominee should attend or the Peak will not be discussed.

An agenda including a list of Peaks to be discussed will be sent with a calendar invite every Thursday
and updated on the Monday morning prior to the meeting.

It is essential that each Peak to be discussed has a business impact and a justification statement
included within the Peak prior to it being discussed. This is to ensure the Peak is fully understood so that
it can be accepted by the PTF / BIF to progress to a solution. The problem must be fully explained in the
progress narrative, and any development or testing fix timescale estimates should be identified. Where
this is not provided the Peak will be routed back to the initiator for further update; once the information is
provided the Peak will be discussed in the next available PTF / BIF.

The agenda will refer to the list of Peaks proposed for that day. Release Management creates the list
and makes it available within Peak shared searches.

The minutes are distributed by the Release Management (Chair).

2.1.1 Schedule

The forum will be held weekly each Monday at 11:00am and will be chaired by Release Management.

2.1.2. Membership and Representation

A mandatory lead may elect to allow a delegate to attend for them at any given instance of the forum.

2.2 PEAK assignment guidelines
The forum will determine the ultimate vehicle (release) for a given PEAK.

PEAKs which introduce business change associated with approved Change Proposals.

3 Process

3.1. Business Impact Forum (BIF)
A list of Peaks for consideration in the BIF will be circulated prior to the meeting.

e Any request for maintenance content to be included in a release must be represented by a ‘Peak
Incident’.

e The request should be made, or sponsored, by a recognised stream lead and placed on the ‘BIF’
stack

e Detailed justification for the Peak to be included in the release

e The requester should attend the BIF session considering the Peak

« The forum will consider the dependencies, effort, timescales and risk of resolving the issue.

e For each PEAK being considered there should be one of the following outcomes:
1. Approved — to be targeted in the next part of the meeting (PTF)
2. Request further information (from originator or other) and defer to a subsequent BIF
3. Add to the Known Error Log (KEL) and close the Peak.

3.2 Peak Targeting Forum (PTF)

A list of Peaks for consideration in the PTF will be circulated prior to the meeting.

e Peaks set to Approved status in the BIF will go on to be targeted to a specific maintenance
release in the second part of the meeting (the PTF).

e Peaks will go directly to the PTF stack (missing out the BIF approval) only for very specific
circumstances, i.e. MSC catch ups — where the defect has already been resolved in Live via an
MSC change request.

3.3. Emergency Peak Targeting Forum (E-PTF)

At any time, if a fault Peak is an ‘A’ priority and deemed business critical, the Release Manager should
be advised so that an immediate fix may be considered and an Emergency PTF convened to discuss
and agree the need and progress the Peak.
