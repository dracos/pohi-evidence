POL has asked that Swiss Cottage and Willsden helpdesk calls be returned first; the requirement is:-

I also need a statement from Fujitsu (Andy Dunks) confirming that Horizon was working correctly at Swiss Cottage (020
005) between 10/07/06 &

07/10/09 and at Willesden (024 005) between 01/01/06 & 12/04/06.

Could you please allow for Andy to work on this request today and tomorrow; I need an estimated timeframe for
completion today to return to POL.

Kind regards
Penny

I will let you know the order of the other 3 tomorrow as Mark and I still need to have the conversations with the

I can find no requests 0809 or 0910 for transaction data for Rinkfield — we-re looking at another 13 ARQs here!

It was good to talk yesterday; let's summarise all of the helpdesk call requests.

A Summary of Helpdesk Call Requests:-

Newsome - we have provided transaction data for Feb — Jun 2008 Helpdesk Call Requirement — Jul 05 to Jun 08

2005 - 6 months
2006 - 12 months
2007 - 12 months
2008 - 1 month -
31 months

West Byfleet - no transaction data was requested — Helpdesk Call Requirement — Jun 05 to Dec 09
55 months

Swiss Cottage - ARQs cover Mar to May 06 and Jul 08 to Oct 09 Helpdesk Call Requirement - Jul 06 to Oct 09
2006 - 6 months

2007 - 12 months

2008 - 6 months -

24 months

Rinkfield — no transaction data was requested Helpdesk Call Requirement — Jun 08 to Jun 09
13 months

Have I overlooked any?

In summary, and by my calculation, if we fill all of these requests for helpdesk calls 123 ARQs will be required!
FUJ00154879
FUJ00154879

To date we have received 434 ARQs — you have 286 to end 0910.
Please call and we can discuss further.

Kind regards
Penny

Penny, can we set up a process for these requests, because we are getting more and more of them.

Would you be able to provide the information Steve has requested (Rinkfield
252 4128 for the period June 2008 to June 2009 for a court case).

Cheers

Thanks for the logs.

I was wondering if you could help me further, I require logs of all calls in relation to Horizon problems, am i right in
thinking the attached log is due to transactional queries?

So the question is how do i obtain any call logs in connection with Horizon problems?

If you wish to discuss please give us a ring on the numbers below.

Thanks
Steve
