Introduction

POL00095329

POL00095329

In this module you will look at three further aspects of theft, that
is, deception, handling stolen goods and going equipped to steal.

In the first section on deception you will look at what the term
deception actually means, and then look at the two particular
crimes involving deception:

+ obtaining property by deception;

+ obtaining services by deception.

In the section on handling stolen goods, you will look at what
handling stolen goods is and how the offence can be committed.
As a Security Manager you will need to understand what points
need to be proved within the offence if you are required to deal
with this type of crime.

In the final section you will look at what going equipped to steal is
and how you would prove the offence if you were required to deal
with it.

Section 1:

Various Acts of Parliament created a number of offences of dishonestly
getting something by cheating. Security Managers commonly refer to
these offences as deception, or criminal deception.

In this section we will consider two particular crimes involving
deception:

+ obtaining property by deception;

+ obtaining services by deception.

This section considers these two offences as outlined in the Theft
Acts of 1968 and 1978. Here is the wording for the offences:

Section 15 (1) Theft Act 1968

A person who by any deception dishonestly obtains property
belonging to another, with the intention of permanently
depriving the other of it shall on conviction or indictment be
liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years.

Section 1 (1) Theft Act 1978

A person who by any deception dishonestly obtains services
from another, shall be guilty of an offence punishable on
indictment to a term of imprisonment not exceeding 5 years.

Section 1:

Check your answer with the following:

QI. Read the definitions of the offences on the previous page.
Work out what features are common to both, and list them
in the box provided.

The features common to both offences are:

* deception

FEEDBACK

* dishonestly

* obtains

The definition of the term deception is provided by Section 15 (4) of
the Theft Act 1968 which states that:

Section 15 (4) Theft Act 1968

Any deception (whether deliberate or reckless) by words or
conduct as to fact or as to law, including a deception as to the
present intentions of the person using the deception or any
other person.

This fairly intricate definition applies to both offences of obtaining
property and services by deception. We will look at each of the
elements individually and provide some examples.

Deception can be described in the following way:
‘To deceive is ...to induce a person to believe that a thing fs true
which is faise and which the person practising the deceit knows

or believes to be false.

(These words have judicial approval.)

Consider the following scenario, and then answer the question that
follows:

A suspect has used a metal disc in a vending machine.
The machine accepts it as a real coin and accordingly
delivers a can.

Q2. Has there been a deception?

POL00095329
POL00095329

Section 1: I

Check your answer with the following:

Q2. Has there been a deception?

No. The suspect has in fact committed theft. For a deception
to take place a person has to be deceived; you cannot deceive

ve a machine.

FEEDBACK The law sees no difference between the case of the suspect

who uses a screwdriver to steal from a machine and one who
uses a coin or disc of some sort to achieve the same result.

We now move on to Deliberate or Reckless:

A deception is deliberate if the accused knows that their statement is
false, and may be accepted as true by the victim.

A deception is reckless if the accused is aware that it may be false,
and may be accepted as true by the victim.

The buyer asks:

“Is it definitely made of gold?”

The seller replies, “Of course it is, 9 Carat. Would I lie to you?”

know that”.

Q3. Is this reckless or deliberate deception?

POL00095329

Section L:

Check your answer with the following:

Q3. Is this reckless or deliberate deception?

This illustrates reckless deception as he did not know or care if
the statement was true,

Deceptions can be carried out by:

« words alone;
* conduct alone;

« words and conduct.

‘An example of a deception by words alone wouid be if a person who
had bottles of cold tea, told a buyer of the bottles that they were in
fact whisky, when they knew all along that they were cold tea.

An example of a deception by conduct alone would be if'a person
who knows that the pools coupons and money are collected every
Thursday night on a particular road, decided to dress the same as the
pools collector and knocked at the houses, following which the
occupants handed over the pools money without any actual
conversation.

An example of deception by words and conduct would be the same
as the previous scenario, except that the occupants of the houses
asked the person if he was the official pools money collector and he
said yes.

well that he has no money. He nevertheless orders a meal intending
to slip out afterwards when the waiter is not looking. After
consuming the meal and a bottle of wine, he tries to sneak out.

He is detained by the waiter and the manager calls the police.

Q4. Has there been a deception? If so, what kind of deception has
taken place?

POL00095329
POL00095329

Section 1:

Check your answer with the following:

Q4. Has there been a deception? If so, what kind of deception has
taken place?

Yes, there has been a deception implied by the person’s
conduct.

FEEDBACK It is now established in law that someone who enters a
restaurant and orders a meal implicitly represents that
they intend to pay for the meal before leaving.

Jt is important to note, however, that if the suspect does not admit
they had a dishonest intention from the outset, it is very difficult to
prove a deception.

This anomaly has been overcome to a large degree by the
introduction of a further offence under Section 3 of the 1978 Theft
Act, “Making Off Without Payment”. This however is not an offence
you come across in your duties as a Security Manager.

‘The phrase as to fact is fairly straightforward. Note that a
misrepresentation as to fact is to be contrasted with a genuinely
held opinion. For example, if the seller of the watch described
previously genuinely believed the watch was a gold one, then he
would not have been practising a deception.

The phrase as to law covers the situation where members of the legal
profession (such as Barristers and Solicitors) make false statements
as to the content of legal documents.

tons
Present intentions is shown in the definition as:

‘including a deception as to the present intentions of the person
using the deception or any other person.’

This sounds more complicated than it really is and can be explained
in the following examples:

Chris promises to paint the exterior of Peter’s house. Chris intends
to do the work. Peter pays him an advance of £200. Chris goes
bankrupt and is unable to do the work.

‘This is merely a promise which has not been kept. Chris did not
deceive Peter as to his present intentions.

Chris promises to paint the exterior of Peter’s house, He asks for
and receives a deposit of £200. Chris has no intention of carrying
out the work and does not do so.

‘This is different from the first case because Chris practised a deception
as to his present intention at the time he made the promise.

Chris is Dave’s business partner. Chris promises that Dave wiil
paint Peter’s house. Chris knows that Dave will not actually do the
work. Peter pays a deposit of £200. Dave does not carry out the
work.

This illustrates another possibility. Chris has practised a deception
as to the present intentions not of himself but of another person ~
Dave. This is covered by the definition of deception.

Section 1:

Dishonestly has not been defined for these deception offences.
However, it can be given its normal everyday meaning as judged by
the standards of ordinary decent people. The Court of Appeal has

alike, and is mentioned in the Theft I module.

The term obtains is fairly self-explanatory.

‘4a person is to be treated as obtaining property if they obtain
ownership, possession or control of it’.

Ownership, possession and control can be given their ordinary,
everyday meaning.

‘,..obtains includes obtaining for another or enabling another
to obtain or retain’.

The important point for you to remember is that obtaining has quite
a wide meaning. It is not restricted to cases where suspects obtain
merely for themselves.

The terms property belonging to another and intention of
permanently depriving the other of it, have the same meaning
as mentioned in the Theft 1 module.

Cheek your answers with the following:

Q5. Has Norman committed an offence contrary to Section 15 of the

No. Norman practised his deception after he had obtained
the property. The deception did not cause Sharon to part
with the property.

FEEDBACK
If you go through the points to prove one by one, you find

them all satisfied apart from number 3.
Q6. What offence if any has been committed by Norman?

Theft. Norman has dishonestly appropriated property
belonging to another with the intention of permanently
depriving the other of it.

Remember that appropriation in theft includes the case where a
person has come by property innocently (as here) without stealing it,
then subsequently assumes a right to it by keeping it as owner.

POL00095329

A person’s labour is something of economic value. It is the main way
by which most people acquire property. It is not itself property. As
such, the delivery of mail or transactions at a Post Office amount to
services.

‘To cause someone by deception to do certain work is not an offence
of obtaining property. It can, however, constitute an offence under
Section I of the Theft Act 1978.

Section 1 (1) Theft Act 1978

A person who by any deception dishonestly obtains
services from another shall be guilty of an offence (arrestable).

Again, a key feature of this offence is that the obtaining must be

by deception. When you investigate the offence, you must establish
each of the points to prove, ensuring that a deception has occurred
prior to the services being dishonestly obtained. These points are:

i. The accused practised a deception.

2. The accused was dishonest.

3. There was a service which it was understood had been or would
be paid for.

4. The deception operated on the mind of the victim and caused
that person to confer the benefit in question.

Deception, dishonesty and point number 4 have already been
considered earlier in this section.

There was a service.
states:

is explained in the 1978 Theft Act which

Section 1 (2) Theft Act 1978

it is an obtaining of services where the other is induced to

FEEDBACK

Q8. Has Mrs Jones committed an offence against Section I of the

Yes. This illustrates the case where the benefit has been
paid for (by Evans, the owner of the card).

Q9. Has Debbie committed an offence against Section 1 of the

Yes. This illustrates a case where it is understood that the
benefit has been paid for. Yet in actual fact it has not, as the
stamps have already been used, so they are no longer valid.
You would, however, have to prove that the Post Office was
deceived into accepting and delivering the mail, and this may
not be easy.

The victim conferred a benefit on someone?

For the purposes of the Act, a person confers a benefit

+ — doing some act (e.g. providing a postal service to the suspect); or

* — causing some act to be done (e.g. telling someone to repair the
suspect’s car); or

+ permitting some act to be done (e.g. being induced to let the
suspect into a football ground to watch a match).

Section 2:

POL00095329
POL00095329

It has been said that if there were no handlers there would be no
thieves. Whilst this may not be strictly true, there can be little doubt
that if the thief could not find a market for the ill-gotten gains, there
would be little point in stealing them in the first place. This view may
well explain why this offence carries a longer maximum sentence of
imprisonment than theft itself.

Handling stolen goods is covered in Section 22 of the Theft Act
1968. It states:

Section 22 Theft Act 1968

A person handles stolen goods if (otherwise than in the
course of the stealing) knowing or believing them to be stolen
goods he dishonestly receives the goods, or dishonestly
undertakes or assists in their retention, removal, disposal or
realisation by or for the benefit of another person, or if he
arranges to do so.

Next we will look at some of the key points of Section 22. They are:

« otherwise than in the course of the stealing
* knowing or believing

« dishonestly

This is here to prevent the thief from being charged with two
offences at the same time, i.e. Theft and Handling Stolen Goods.
Although the thief may physically handle the goods, they would not
normally be charged under this Section.

At the time of the handling, the person must either know the goods to
be stolen or believe them to be stolen.

POL00095329
POL00095329

Section 2:

The person must act dishonestly. Take, for example, the situation
where a person receives goods which they knew to be stolen, with
the express intention of returning them to the owner or the Police.

In this case, whilst they fulfil the element of “Knowing or Believing”,
they de not act dishonestly, therefore both necessary mental
elements would not be present. If, however, the person retained the
goods without the intention to return them, this would be dishonest.

The knowing or believing combined with the dishonesty is often
referred to as guilty knowledge. This guilty knowledge is generally
proved by circumstantial evidence.

Ifa person bought goods from an unlikely seller in an unlikely place
at an unlikely time and for an unlikely price, then the inference
would be that the accused believed the goods to be stolen,

Other factors which could assist the Court to determine guilty
knowledge could be one or a combination of the following:
I + direct evidence, ¢.g. admission of the accused;

* concealment of property;

* property found after denial of possession:

+ removal of identification marks;

a FP Tee EE EK EEN SE EE OE OF

* immediate disposal of the goods:

+ furtive or secret disposal of the goods. ”

None of the above is absolute proof; they all require explanation. =

Section 2:

The obvious meaning of stolen goods is goods obtained by theft.
Section 24 (4) of the Act extends that considerably and includes:

1. Goods which have been stolen, contrary to Section I
(Theft Act 1968).

Nv

Goods which have been obtained as a result of blackmail,
contrary to Section 21 (Theft Act 1968).

i 3. Goods which have been obtained by means of deception,
I contrary to Section 15 (Theft Act 1968).

4. Goods which have been stolen abroad, contrary to the law
of that land.

In Handling Stolen Goods, the word goods has been used instead of
the word property. However, they basically mean the same thing.

Let’s look at the definition of goods as given by the Theft Act 1968.
Section 34 Theft Act 1968

Goods includes money and every other description of
property except land and includes things severed from
the land by stealing.

You can see that the definition of goods states that it includes
every description of property. Therefore the phrase shows us
that real, personal, things in action and other intangible property
also fall within the definition.

POL00095329
POL00095329

Section 2: I

Goods cease to be stolen if:

« they have been returned to the owner or person from whom they
were stolen;

+ they are in other lawful possession (e.g. the Police);

» the owner has abandoned, or ceased to have, any claim on the
goods.

When dealing with a case of handling stolen goods, the following
four points must be proved if a conviction is to be obtained.

1. The goods were originally stolen or dishonestly obtained.

2. The goods were still stolen goods at the time of the alleged
handling.

3. The accused dishonestly received the goods or dishonestly
undertook or assisted in their retention, removal, disposal or
realisation by, or for, the benefit of another person, or arranged
to do so.

4. The accused knew or believed the goods to be stolen at the time
of handling.

On conviction the maximum punishment is 14 years imprisonment.

Section 3:

Theft 2

POL00095329
POL00095329

This section deals with people who equip themselves for committing
offences as outlined in the Theft Act.

Section 25 (1) Theft Act 1968

A person shall be guilty of an offence if, when not at his
place of abode, he has with him any article for use in the
course of or in connection with any burglary, theft or cheat.

Although the maximum penalty is only 3 years imprisonment, this
offence is one of those deemed as an arrestable offence in Section
24 (2) of PACE. (Arrestable offences are dealt with in another
module.)

In order to prove that a suspect was going equipped, the following
points must be proved:

1. The accused was not at his place of abode

N

He knowingly had with him
Any article

ey

For use in the course of or in connection with any burglary,
theft or cheat

The phrase place of abode simply means where the person lives.
It would, of course, include any gardens, sheds, etc., which form part
of the property. A person who is living rough in a car is at their place
of abode when on a site with the intention of abiding there, but not
when the vehicle is in transit from one site to another.

POL00095329
POL00095329

Section 3:

From a practical point of view, this offence can be committed as soon
as the accused leaves their home. You do not have to prove they were
in a public place.

It could therefore include any of the following:

+ place of work;
+ the street;
* a public house;

* in their car (when not in the garage at their home or on a site).

The expression with him is worth considering for a moment. It
doesn’t just mean that the suspect was carrying the goods in their
hand, it also includes articles in the suspect’s possession or control.

For example, it includes where the goods are in the suspect’s vehicle,
or even where some other person (frequently an innocent friend) is
carrying them. However, if that other person is clearly acting
together with the suspect, then both “had with them”.

The articles do not need to be in anyone’s possession.

For example: If a suspect enters a Sub-Post Office yard and leans a
ladder up against the back of the office for a moment, then moves
away to see if the coast is clear, they would still be deemed to have
the ladder with them.

Remember that you must also prove that the accused knew they had
the articles with them, and that they intended to use them for one of
the specified purposes.

Section 3:

Any article means exactly what it says. So the ladder our suspect is
carrying is just as much an article as, for example, a hammer and
chisel for a burglary or a self-addressed label for overlabelling and
stealing postal packets.

The article does not have to be as sinister as a hammer. A person who
decides to steal something from Tesco’s supermarket and deliberately
takes a Tesco’s carrier bag with them to put the goods in is going
equipped for theft.

This point includes offences of theft and burglary (Sections 1 and 9 of
the Theft Act 1968) and the word cheat in this context means an
offence under Section 15 (1) of the Act. Any intention to commit the
offence of obtaining property by deception will effectively entail guilt
under this Section, provided the other elements can be proved.

This module focused on three areas relating to theft, ie. deception,
handling stolen goods and going equipped to steal.

In Section 1 we explored the meaning of deception. We then looked
at obtaining property by deception and obtaining services by
deception as defined in the Theft Acts of 1968 and 1978.

Section 2 looked at the offence of handling stolen goods. We looked
at how this offence can be committed and what a Security Manager
would have to prove within the offence.

Finally, in Section 3, we dealt with the offence of going equipped to
steal. We looked at the four points you would have to prove to
establish this offence.
