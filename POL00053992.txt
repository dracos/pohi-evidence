1.3.2

Hypothesis: The User Interface gives rise to incorrect data entry

Source of problem — training and support: full and complete training
materials and training records have yet to be provided. In addition a log
of calls and response to the NBSC would provide further evidence as to the
understanding of the users at the West Byfleet branch.

Source of problem — user interface: there has not been an opportunity to
conduct a usability review to date; in addition, the logs included in Andy Dunk
2". witness statement refer to problems with the touch screen which require
the screen to be calibrated. It has not been possible to test whether this
could give rise to incorrectly captured user actions.

Hypothesis: The Horizon system fails to properly process transactions

Source of problem — End to end EPOSS transaction flow: the equipment
failure user guide provided identifies at subsection 14 a process for identifying
lost EPOSS transactions. The implication is that EPOSS transactions can be
lost due to equipment failures. Without access to the sub post office data
records and the intermediate data records in the end to end process it will
not be possible to identify the extent to which this may explain the accounting
discrepancies.

Source of problem — Poor integration: the helpdesk reports provided in Andy
Dunks 2™ statement identify a series of problems with the network, printer
and the pin terminal. It has not been possible to test whether this could give
rise to inconsistent data capture and transmission at the sub post office.

Source of problem -— systems issues causing incomplete/inconsistent
processing of transactions between sub post office and central systems: the
reports provided in Andy Dunks 2™ statement identify a number of cases in
which the user was required to ‘re-boot’ the terminal. It has not been
possible to test whether this could give rise to inconsistent data records in the
sub post office.

Hypothesis: Errors in operator data entry are not properly reconciled by
the Post Office finance function or by the Horizon system: without access
to the system files it is not possible to determine whether this is the case.

Source of problem — lack of reconciliation of EPOSS transactions end to end:
without access to the system data files it is not possible to determine
whether this is the case.

Source of problem — lack of reconciliation of other transactions end to end:
without access to the system data files it is not possible to determine
whether this is the case.
