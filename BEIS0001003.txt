Morning all,

You may have seen this on twitter:

Minister Hollinrake has asked for an update on interim payments before he meets with Nick Read on
21 January (I’m sure you were planning to include lines on this in the briefing anyway, and there are
also lines on this in the BEIS Committee update which he is yet to review).

You'll see that the Minister asked those still awaiting interim payments to contact the ministerial
email address — we’ve received 2 emails so far this morning — see attached. Please could you let me
know if you’re happy to take these forward?

Many thanks,
Cora
