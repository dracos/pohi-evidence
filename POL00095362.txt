Dear Tim

Further to our recent telephone conversation regarding Cleveleys SPSO.

As you will recall Cobap initiated the accounting checks which have revealed two under claims.
Please find enclosed details that the Paid Order Unit sent to us substantiating the errors.

When Chesterfield have completed their enquiries, will you please let me know the outcome.

Yours sincerely,

Lisa Crabtree
