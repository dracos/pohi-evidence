Dear Mr Palmer
Re Lottery Seratechcards

Andy Baker has asked me to investigate and respond to the points you
have raised in your e mail of 8" October. I’m sorry to learn that incorrect
scratchcard holdings have been declared at your branch for such a long
time.

It is important to understand what an auditor does in a branch. They will
run a balance snapshot report which produces a view of the branch’s
status at that point. The auditor will then compare actual holdings of cash
and stock against the balance snapshot.

Back in April 2008 they determined that Horizon was recording
more scratchcards more than was physically on hand, Horizon
ratcheard holdings were then adjusted down to actual levels. This
created a cash shortfall on Horizon which was cleared through cash held
in the safe ~ presumably though sales that had not been recorded on
Horizon,

Horizon records at the time of audit would only show scratchcards that
had been remmed in on Horizon. The auditors would not have assured all
the Camelot activations against Horizon remittances. This exercise is
carried out in Product & Branch Accounting. The transaction correction
you refer to was issued to correct a number of discrepancies between
activations and remittances ~ see attached sheet.

POL00105278
POL00105278
POL00105278
POL00105278

As these scratchcards were not physically held in your branch it feels
reasonable to assume they had been sold, but the sales had not been
recorded on Horizon.

The transaction correction will have been accepted in AA stock unit,
This replicates the missed remittances and created a stock balance, As
they were not physically there but had been sold, the sale should have
been recorded on Horizon. This would have corrected your scratcheard
stock position but would of course have required the cash from the sales
to be input to the Horizon cash to remain in a balanced position.

As this was not carried out in 2008 the incorrect stock has remained on
Horizon and does need to be corrected now,

Ican only see one scratchcard transaction correction being issued in 2011
(others have possibly been archived). I’ve also sent the
activations/remittances recorded over the relevant period to illustrate why
this transaction correction (September 2011) needed to be issued.

Alan Lusher would not know why a transaction correction would have
been issued. He does not agree that he would have told you that it would
be resolved in house and was nothing to concern you.

The transaction corrections have been issued because Horizon

remittances have not been recorded to align to Camelot activations. I

have no reason to suggest they were not correct to be issued. To instigate

a further investigation I would need to see Horizon remittance slips that
=

align to Camelot activations ¢.g. remittances totalling £720 as opposed to
the £480 in my records on 25" or 26" Pebraary 2008.

I can’t see any documentation relating to 3 October 2012 and am not
sure if any investigation is needed here.

I hope this has clarified why audit sign off does not mean that transaction
correction will not be subsequently issued. I have also covered off the
reason why scratcheard stock will be held on your AA stock unit.

lam afraid the stock levels do need correcting as described above.
Whilst I appreciate this will be painful, the cash should already have been
in the branch back in 2008 when the sales were made.

Yours sincerely

Andy Winn

The PDF files may seem hard to expiain on here but basically the dates on the top show when I was audited, when the
error not arrived, who sent the error notice and when I queried it.

There was another 3 instances of error notices received in and again these were queried due to the fact that all the
entries that were meant to bs on my system actually were and I have all the paperwork for them too, these dated in April,
May and June 2011, a co incidence that I would make an error 3 times in a row over 3 consecutive months, bearing in
mind there were no error notices prior too or since, I attach the file showing the cross reference but havent scanned
every transaction at this point.

From the AA stock unit @ 3rd October 2012 and the Trading Period report it shows a disrepancy to my OOH stock of
quite a few scratcheards. Any error notice I receive I always drill down before hand and query if I feel its wrong or make
good where necessary. As far as I am concerned there shouldnt be ANY scratchoard figures on AA stock unit.

this can resolve this issue and if you need any further information from me then please do not hesitate
nappy to co operate fully, At this moment in time I have 2 members of staff on holiday and have few
time, herice the late response for which I apologise.
