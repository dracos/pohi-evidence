Colin,
I've done a bit more to this but if I continue I fear I might call him a git, or something worse.

I'll be in CREO2 and have access to email tomorrow up to 2:00pm so if we want to progress it and send it to Jim Cruise we
will need to do something tomorrow am.

Should we be involving Mason's at this stage?

Cheers,
