We've got our marching orders from POL to look into the point around remote access of Horizon as I mentioned the
other day on the phone. POL have decided to stick with Deloitte doing this for now but I'm not convinced this will work
and we made need to step in.

The plan is to:

Get up to speed on Deloitte's work to date

Re-instruct Deloitte so that they are instructed on a privileged basis by BD rather than an arguably non-
privileged basis by POL

Meet with Deloitte to discuss further ways to investigate this point.

Likely meet with Deloitte and FJ to investigate the issue further

Use the information found to draft a section for our Letter of Response to the Letter of Claim (first draft due on
28 June).

MPO NS

This is all pretty urgent as Counsel has identified this as the key point to be addressed.

Question is — are you able to help? It'll need to be top of your to do list for the next couple of weeks if we're to get this
done on time. Feel free to say no / not possible.

Paul / Rich —shout if you have Jonny lined up for something else.
