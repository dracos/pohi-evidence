Purpose/Summary of Change: (Define why the CP is required and what it seeks to achieve)

The SSC require a standardised configuration for SSC users to have the required levels of
write access to non-BRDB databases which enable them to perform their contract
obligations, and to remove the variants that currently exist across the team.

Any granted role that provides an SSC user with write permissions to a database should
NOT be set by default - so the user has to switch to the write access role.

The SSC simply require write access to specific database tables, and NOT DBA privileges.

Description of Change Proposed: (Provide a full description of the change unless detailed in attached
documentation):

The SSC users will be re-aligned to have both ‘SSC’ and ‘RESOURCE’ granted with default
set to YES. This is to provide the SSC User with read access to the tables when they logon

Any other default write access is to be revoked from the SSC users for the following
databases.

Anew role of ‘SSC_RW’ is to be introduced and granted to the SSC users with default set
to NO (so the user has to switch to the role).

The ‘SSC_RW’ role will be configured to provide the SSC user with write access to the
database tables owned by the application schema(s), but it will not provide any of the DBA
type privileges that the SSC do not require.

Fujitsu will continue to follow the ‘Horizon Data Change’ process
SVM/SDM/PRO/4293 - HORIZON DATA CHANGES PROCESS WORK INSTRUCTION.

Note:
For the BRDB database, use of the APPSUP role will remain the same, requiring approvals
and Unix to add the role on a temporary basis.

All associated process documentation is to be brought up to date and into line to describe
the revisions.

SecOps require that all ‘SSC_RW’ actions taken are logged and audited as this provides the
assurance to POA that Fujitsu Services can provide evidence if required to do so - this

Testing:

It is assumed in the impacts that this will be tested once in LST utilising two Test resources,
and then the changes will be retro fitted back into SV&I as part of its monthly top up.

It is assumed that this will speed up the delivery and reduce the testing impact on SV&I test
resources assigned to HNG-X functional changes and support of P2C migration projects .
The testing would be conducted over 5 elapsed days with 2 additional days for regression
testing.

Scope:

This change relates to the named systems Fujitsu own and operate and to which POA
determines access configuration. As such this is only applicable to Belfast as POC is for
Post Office to set rights and access on.
