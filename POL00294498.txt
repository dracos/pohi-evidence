1). These pleas were acceptable to the prosecution and the case was
adjourned for sentence to 6"" April 2010 when he was sentenced as
outlined in paragraph 1 above. A confiscation hearing was listed for 2"¢
July 2010 and the section 18 prosecution statement was served and a
POCA timetable set. Payment in full of the balance was then made by the
defendant in April of the outstanding amount. Solicitors for the Post
Office notified the court but the defendant was still produced on the 2"!

July. In the event the confiscation proceedings were not proceeded with.

Prosecution case

5. The defendant had been employed by St Mary’s Bay Post Office since
October 2005 as a sub-postmaster. On 26" August 2009 officers arrived
at 0820 hours to perform an audit. At 0855 hours a preliminary cash
check revealed that the branch was approximately £50,000 short. The
defendant arrived at 0910. He was invited to do an independent count of
all the cash on hand but declined and said he would accept the audit. He
made the following admissions:

“It started with approx. £8K of shortages due to errors made processing
Alliance and Leicester business deposits. Not at the office but at
processing at Alliance and Leicester. Then got into some financial
difficulty. Whenever there was a shortage, I would make a deposit into my
Alliance and Leicester Account through Horizon to cover it but not
actually put the money into the till. This shortage is cumulative over
approx one year. There were also other customers’ Alliance and Leicester

deposits that were processed but somehow caused shortages”.

The audit resulted in a shortage of £47,920.22.

A spreadsheet of all deposits made to the defendant’s Alliance and
Leicester account was prepared between 3™ March 2009 and 25th August
2009.

. The defendant was interviewed under caution on 1* September 2009. He
said as follows:

i. In February or March 2008 a local business customer said she had
made 2 deposits totalling £8,000 into her Alliance and Leicester
Account;

ii. Both the deposits were entered onto HORIZON and she had date
stamped receipts. However, the money was not in the system.

iii. As she had receipts he had to make good the £8,000, leaving the till
£8,000 short;

iv. He inflated the cash in hand figure to cover the shortage

v. He got into financial difficulties consisting of arrears in his mortgage
payments for the Post Office;

vi. Around April 2008 he started to put Post Office cash into his A and L
account so that he could pay standing orders and direct debits;

vii.

The way he would take the money would be, for example, if he had

£1,800 in direct debits and only had £1,500 in the account he would

enter £1,800 on the HORIZON making a shortfall of £300.

viii. I He would do this weekly. The majority of the deposits were done
on Tuesdays as the payments came out of his account on Wednesdays;

ix. He used the shop takings to pay staff wages and bills rather than
paying the shop takings into his A and L account;

x. He would log on under staff member’s user identifications;

xi. He could not obtain loans as his credit history ‘was not good enough’

xii.

He did not speak to anyone at the Post Office personnel about his

financial position or obtain permission to use Post office funds.

xiii. He confirmed that between April 2008 and December 2008 he
would have used approximately £17,000 of Post office funds;

xiv.He was shown the spreadsheet mentioned at the end of paragraph 3
above and said that in 2009 his financial situation worsened as a
tenant on his buy to let property failed to pay his rent;

xv. £40,000 was paid into his A and L account by him;

xvi.A lot of the shortage in the audit was because he paid Post Office funds

into his own account.

xvii. He required £8,000 per month to cover his outgoings.

xviii. He was shown trading statements for 5° March - 9" April 2008,
12" November - 10'" December 2008 and 8" July - 12™ August 2009
and confirmed that all those Final Trading statements were false
accounts;

xix.He had been false accounting since 5" March 2008 until the audit on

26" August 2009.

Defence case

7. The defendant pleaded guilty to the 3 counts of false accounting at his
plea and case management hearing. In his interview he accepted that
£40,000 of the £47,920.22 shortfall was paid into his own account for his
own use and the spreadsheet of his bank account was available showing
the payments in. I can find no record of his contesting the amount averred
in the indictment, apart from a document headed “Schedule of Sensitive
Material”, where the officer in the case, Natasha Bernard, refers to the
defendant supplying her with an article relating to the integrity of the

HORIZON system, with an accompanying letter from the defendant.

Discussion

8. The defendant raised, by inference, what he would call an ‘error’ in the
workings of the HORIZON system when he made reference to the
‘disappearance’ of £8,000 deposited by a business customer in his
interview under caution. The interviewing officer pointed out that, had
£8,000 been deposited but not entered onto the system, the Post office till

should have shown an £8,000 surplus.

9. This is a case where the defendant was lucky that the Crown accepted the
pleas that they did. His admissions in interview were easily sufficient to

mount a strong case on the Theft count. He admitted false accounting over
17 months in interview. I cannot see how any disclosure of the issues in
raised in the Second Sight Interim Report could assist in the mounting of
an appeal against either sentence or conviction. In this case we would not
have disclosed the material had we had it at the time as the defendant had

pleaded guilty at the PCMH before any defence statement was served.

Conclusion

7. In this case I can see no requirement to disclose anything to this

defendant's lawyers.
