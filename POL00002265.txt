Dear Mr Moore
Re Branch Discrepancies

You may have been aware of 2 unexplained discrepancies that have
impacted your branch.

I can confirm that gains totalling £11.55 declared at both TP9 in 2011/12
and 2012/13 were not proper to your branch. This problem was created
by a specific set of circumstances dating back to actual gains you
declared in 2010 (TP8).

In brief the stock unit that cleared the gain of this value was deleted on or
before 10 December 2010. The related Local Suspense entry should
also have been removed, but this did not happen.

The impact of this was that the declaration of the gain of 2010 was picked
up again at the beginning of TP9 the next year in Horizon. At the end of
TP9 the branch was forced to clear this along with current discrepancies.
The Local Suspense ledger in the Post Office Finance System was
impacted in the same way.

This scenario was then repeated at the same point the next year.

Both TP9 discrepancies recorded at your branch were of course made
good at the point of branch trading. Post Office Ltd will not seek to
recover these gains. You may not have been aware of these discrepancies
but I felt it to be important to make you aware of the problem.

Changes to Horizon in 2011 prevented this problem for stock units
deleted after mid-December 2010, and the old Local Suspense entry has
now been removed from the system.

I do apologise for this problem being allowed to occur and impacting
your branch.

Yours sincerely
