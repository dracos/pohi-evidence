FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF TERENCE PAUL AUSTIN

THIS STATEMENT IS PROVIDED IN RESPONSE TO THE RULE 9 REQUEST
NUMBER 1 DATED 7 JUNE 2022 FOR INFORMATION PURSUANT TO PHASE 2
OF INQUIRY: HORIZON IT SYSTEM: PROCUREMENT, DESIGN, PILOT, ROLL
OUT AND MODIFICATIONS.

|, Mr Terence Paul Austin, will say as follows:

INTRODUCTION

1. | have over 40 years’ experience in the Information Technology sector leading
large complex government and commercial programmes from the business
requirements definition stage through to system implementation. In addition to
ICL Pathway, projects included the UK Customer Billing system for Severn

Trent Water, Branch Network System for Eurodollar/TSB, Corporation Tax and

WITN04190100

the Self-Assessment system for the Inland Revenue and a complete technology

refresh programme for the National Trust.

BACKGROUND

2.

| joined the Fujitsu ICL bid team as Programme Director in 1995 to help
formulate the proposal to deliver an automated benefit card system and
electronic point of sale system for DSS/POCL. Following successful selection,
| became responsible for delivering the IT Pathway Solution. As the system
grew in size and complexity, | was appointed Systems Director as part of an
organisational restructure. | left the programme in October 2000 shortly after
rollout had commenced, because my experience and knowledge were no
longer required following formal POCL acceptance of the system. The
programme moved naturally from what was primarily a development
organisational structure into a structure focusing on service management and
operational support which required different managerial and technical

expertise.

The aims and objectives of the £1b programme were two-fold, for the DSS they
were to replace the paper-based methods of paying social security benefits

fraud free with a magnetic stripe payment card and for POCL they were to
automate the national network of post offices and introduce an electronic point
of sale system (EPOSS). For ICL Pathway, the objective was to be awarded
the DSS/POCL PFI contract and to deliver it successfully. In parallel, the
company would also explore all opportunities to sell the solution to other post

offices worldwide.

PROCUREMENT

4. My involvement in the procurement process was to evaluate the system
requirements specified in the Invitation to Tender document (ITT) and
determine the ICL resources necessary and third parties needed to deliver the

solution in the timescales defined.

5. The delivery schedule for the solution was extremely ambitious and, in my
opinion, could only be achieved by implementing what was known in the
industry as a ‘turn-key’ or ‘off the shelf system. The time available from award

of contract in May 1996 to the first implementation was only 18 weeks and
only 10 months to carry out a fully functional live trial. This was only possible
by integrating several existing products and interfacing with existing DSS and
POCL systems. There was limited scope for any bespoke software
development. With the benefit of hindsight, DSS/POCL seemed blissfully

unaware that this was a consequence of the timescales set and gave the

impression that they expected to specify their detailed requirements during

the months running up to the live trial in March 1997.

6. It was essential for ICL Pathway to have a baseline functional specification of
their solution which had been demonstrated during the latter stages of the
procurement activity. This was produced and a clause in the contract stated
that this document must be signed off by DSS/POCL within 30 days of the
award of contract. In addition, ICL Pathway assumed that the 289
‘agreements to agree’ would be resolved within 3 months as these included

many essential non-functional requirements such as system security.

WITN04190100

WITN04190100
However, neither of these critical milestones were achieved placing the
project at significant risk of failure.
7. A comprehensive and detailed history of the procurement process is described

in the report on ‘The Cancellation of the Benefits Payment Card project’
produced by the National Audit Office published 18 August 2000 RLITO000001
[WITNO419_01/1]. All the relevant people in ICL Pathway, the DSS and POCL
contributed to this report which in my opinion was accurate and well researched
although it didn’t address the obvious tensions between the DSS and POCL
regarding the continuing use of the post office network to pay benefits. The DSS
were trying to reduce the costs associated with benefit payments whereas
POCL, an expensive option, needed the benefit business to sustain their
network. The NAO concluded that there were various complex factors which
contributed to the card project's failure and that Government should heed the

lessons to be learnt.

INITIAL GO LIVE (IGL)

8. Itis important to understand that the first two versions of the solution to be made
available i.e. IGL & IGL2 were predominantly releases for the Benefit Payment
Card aspects of the system and involved 10 Post Offices in Stroud paying Child
Benefit only, this was subsequently increased to 205 offices in the north and
south of the country. | do recall that during this time, very few software defects
were identified, and we were surprised that the project was subsequently
cancelled. There was very little functionality introduced for POCL consequently
it has limited relevance to ‘The Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry’. In fact, when the

DSS made the decision to cancel the project in May 1999, all the relevant card

4of 20

WITN04190100

WITN04190100

software was removed from the ICL Pathway solution. The POCL Horizon
project only came into existence in the spring of 1998 and a new agreement
with Post Office Counters Ltd signed in July 1999. Essentially, the first half of
the development focused on the DSS requirement and the second half on the

POCL functionality.

It became clear during the weeks following award of contract that the
DSS/POCL required significant additional functionality which had not been
previously specified. This meant that in many instances manual ‘workarounds’
were introduced rather than enhance the software because there was
insufficient time available. It also became clear that the DSS CAPS interface
was immature and poorly defined and subject to constant change. A CAPS
Interface definition document should have made available shortly after award
of contract, but this did not happen. There was no doubt that the DSS were
the dominant partner, and the benefit payment functionality took precedence
over the POCL EPOSS functionality which would be developed in parallel over
a longer period using an iterative development approach. On the plus side,
the initial go live system was delivered on time, and it worked well, containing
very few software defects. In addition, the installation processes and the
training for post masters was well received albeit it was on a much smaller

scale than the forthcoming national rollout.

The lessons learnt from IGL from an ICL Pathway perspective are described in
document FUJ00058278 [WITN0419_01/2]. Other issues which came to light
were that there was no single DSS/POCL business requirements authority,

agreed change control process or effective management of system interfaces.

WITN04190100

WITN04190100

The Programme Delivery Authority (PDA) set up by DSS/POCL was unwieldy,
ineffective and communication was haphazard and inconsistent. It was also
crucial that the working relationship and transparency between the parties
improved, particularly with the DSS. Their attitude was guarded, secretive and
confrontational at times, this made developing a successful solution much more
difficult, but | cannot shed any light on the reasons behind this behaviour. This
conduct continued until DSS withdrew from the programme following
‘cancellation’. As time progressed in the early days it became apparent that
neither DSS or POCL were ready managerially or technically and their systems
were not prepared for the solution they had procured, in particular the DSS

CAPS system.

SUBSEQUENT RELEASES AND SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT

11.

12.

Following on from IGL, | believe that two more releases were planned known
as NR1, NR2 but after the DSS cancellation and the birth of Horizon these were
renamed CSR and CSR+. There may have been other interim releases, but |

would need to inspect the high level plans to be certain.

The process for developing the ICL pathway element of the Horizon system
was described in the Software Engineering Process document supported by
various stage process documents such as design, development and testing
which have not been made available to me. However, in my opinion these
represented the very best in the industry and conformed to international
standards at the time. It should also be noted that POCL approved all the
software functional specifications and test plans and in many instances also

witnessed the actual tests and the results achieved. The POCL personal

WITN04190100

involved in the approval process would depend on the knowledge and skills
required and the individual nominated would be listed in the relevant section of
each document. Once approved a document would be maintained under formal
change control. Tracking the original customer requirements through the
design, development, testing and acceptance stages, was the most thorough

and detailed process of its kind | had ever seen.

A comprehensive and sophisticated process for managing change to the

solution was agreed by all parties whether the change was to the contract,
approved documentation, software or baseline delivery plans. This was a

critically important process because it enabled the programme to quantify the
impact that change was having on the solution and the delivery schedule. A
change could be instigated by the DSS, POCL or ICL Pathway (CCN, CR
and/or CP) and would only be implemented if the implications were fully
understood, costed and approved by the appropriate Change Control Board.
ICL Pathway would assess the request in detail and estimate the costs and
timescales involved. This would then be passed back to DSS/POCL who
would decide whether to authorise the work. If approved, ICL Pathway would
amend the various specifications and other supporting documents, amend
and test the code and make it available in a future release. In some cases,
the cost in manpower would be considerable. There was a_ fast-track
procedure for urgent and critical change but even taking the time to evaluate
a change could divert valuable resources. Coping with the number of
essential software changes requested became a major issue for the
programme in the latter stages but | was not party to how change was

managed within the POCL domain.

DELAY

14.

15.

16.

There were many technical challenges encountered during the development of
the solution, but this was not unexpected with a system of this magnitude.
These issues would be discussed, and resolutions agreed at the numerous
architectural, design, performance, scalability and development forums and/or
meetings created for this purpose. | cannot be specific without reviewing the
various progress reports and issues log available at the time. What | can be
certain of is that that the solution grew in size and complexity exponentially from
that defined in the Invitation to Tender (ITT) and this presented a major

challenge for ICL Pathway and its ability to maintain the delivery schedule.

System interfaces were well known in the industry for creating difficulties
especially across ownership boundaries and Horizon was no exception e.g.
Pathway to DSS systems and Pathway to POCL systems were certainly
problematic. There is a view that the problems encountered with the ICL
Pathway to CAPS interface were the main reason why the card project was

cancelled.

The ICL Pathway Architecture comprised of four layers and the middleware
which linked the front-end Microsoft based systems with the back-end Oracle
based systems proved troublesome due to their differing architectural
principles. This was a bit like trying to interface between Apple’s iOS and an
Android device in today’s world. Additionally, providing acceptable desktop
response times, managing the huge transaction volumes predicted, delivering
state of the art back up & recovery capabilities, satisfying ground-breaking

security requirements, and building the numerous hardware configurations to

8 of 20

17.

18.

19.

WITN04190100

WITN04190100

handle the variety of testing requirements were all formidable challenges
which had to be overcome. Other difficulties included the large number of post
office staff required to be trained, the incredible speed of rollout and
developing the ability to remotely install new software updates on the tills in
the post offices overnight. Although the latter is commonplace nowadays, it

was cutting edge technology at the time.

Inevitably, slippages and delays did occur, and it was not always evident who
was responsible. There were lots of interdependencies and opportunities to
misunderstand a requirement which would require rework or certain software
functions would be underestimated. The ICL Pathway plan comprised of
thousands of activities linked via many levels of detail, so slippage on one
task wouldn't necessarily mean slippage to the overall schedule unless it was
on the critical path. Whatever the case, actions would be taken to recover the
situation, or to utilise the contingency built in at various points within the

plan.

Having said that, | do not believe that ICL Pathway management was made
aware of the extent of the problems that DSS and POCL were experiencing
with their obligations and their IT systems throughout the development

process.

| cannot remember whether the key milestones (e.g.start of live trial) for CSR
or CSR+ were delayed, to determine that | would have to review the progress
reports and delivery plan updates. The documents made available to the
Inquiry are only a snapshot in time and it is necessary to follow an issue

through to its closure to reach any meaningful conclusion.

WITN04190100

WITN04190100

There was a ‘Risk Management Plan’ FUJ00077883 [WITN0419_01/3] which
was reviewed and updated on a regular basis. This was an attempt to predict
what events could happen during the course of development, estimate the cost,
probability of it occurring and identify the mitigation actions. | do recall one such
event which was caused by the Intel Corporation updating its chip technology
(firmware) before all the desktop tills had been manufactured and delivered by
Fujitsu. If this had not been addressed successfully, it would have resulted in a
complete retest of the ICL Pathway solution and significant delays would have
resulted. Fujitsu managed to obtain enough of the original chips worldwide and
kept their production lines open until the required number of desktops had been

delivered, a remarkable achievement.

The impact of any delay would depend on the party involved. For DSS it may
undermine their Business Case as described in ‘The Cancellation of the

Benefits Payment Card project’ produced by the National Audit Office, referred
to earlier in this statement: RLITO000001 [WITN0419_01/1]. For ICL Pathway
it would be increased cost in terms of additional resources either manpower or
hardware equipment resulting in a worsening of their business case. For POCL,

it would increase the time taken to automate their post office network.

ROLL OUT AND DEFECTS/SYSTEM ROBUSTNESS

22.

As Systems Director | was aware of all the bugs, errors and defects within the
ICL solution but only to the extent of ensuring that they were identified and
documented at the earliest opportunity and that the highest priority issues were
analysed and fixed as quickly as possible. Through this process, | did become

aware of a quality issue with the early versions of the EPOSS product which

10 of 20

23.

24.

WITN04190100

WITN04190100

was created using a Rapid Application Development technique (RAD). This
agile methodology was in its early stages of development in the 90’s and was
adopted when there was no detailed business requirement specification and
the application had to be delivered quickly via a series of iterations with the end
user. Due to its immaturity, it was rarely used for large systems where the
requirement and design specifications had to be signed off before any work
commenced, otherwise known as the ‘waterfall approach’. The supporting
documentation would instead be produced as the application developed. The
absence of a detailed business requirement specification for EPOSS meant that
this was the only way this functionality could be produced. A consequence of
the RAD approach was that the design specifications had to be ‘reverse
engineered’ from the code. Not ideal, but if done properly there should be no

lasting implications.

In July 1997 the ICL Pathway Chief Architect and senior members of Escher,
one of our partners who were experts in Microsoft messaging technology,
concluded that the EPOSS application was not sufficiently robust and should
be re-engineered by Escher to utilise the features offered by the Riposte
software. Following the return of the product in November 1997, more functional
changes were implemented, and a large number of fixes applied, but certain
aspects of the software still appeared to be unstable. Consequently, in the
autumn 1998 | asked for a Task Force to be created to establish the nature and

cause of the outstanding defects and to fix them..

The Task Force comprised of seasoned IT professionals in multiple disciplines

and some members of the team were concerned that the code may have

11 of 20

25.

26.

WITN04190100

WITN04190100

decayed due to the scale of the changes that had been applied since the
product had returned from Escher, but others did not believe this to be the case.
The Task Force did not achieve its primary objective to reduce the errors to
near zero for a variety of reasons, but it did provide an invaluable insight into
the root causes of the issues we were experiencing which were not all code

related.

Acorrection action plan was then devised which adopted the recommendations
which emerged from the Task Force report FUJ00080690 [WITN0419_01/4,
introduced more intensive testing at all levels and changes in personnel to
improve the skill and competence of those involved in the corrective action

activities

An internal audit report published in September 1999 recommended that we
consider a re-design and re-write of EPOSS and this was reiterated in a
Development Audit published in October 1999 FUJ00079782
[WITN0419_ 01/5], the reasons given was the level of outstanding issues was
still too high. This option was debated at length by senior members of the ICL
Pathway management and technical teams and the outcome was that we
should embark upon a major exercise to target the specific areas known to be
source of most (circa 80%) of the issues identified which were error handling
and printing. If this approach was unsuccessful, then a rewrite would be the
only option available. However, the product did become stable, and the number
of outstanding defects did fall within the levels defined in the acceptance

criteria.

WITN04190100
WITN04190100

| cannot be certain whether the internal quality concerns were communicated
to POCL but they were aware of the number of software errors (PinICL’s) being
detected, fixed and those still outstanding at particular point in time. In fact, they
did raise an acceptance incident 298 to reflect this issue but this was formally
closed by POCL late 1999. They were also aware of the functional shortcomings

noted midway through the development and helped to address them.

Subsequently, the functional and design specifications, the test plans and
results of the testing were subsequently signed off by POCL and formal
acceptance was achieved following successful completion of the operational

live trial in the spring 2000.

All the errors and defects identified in the ICL Pathway solution, their severity
and their status were documented at every stage of the testing and release
processes. It was accepted in the industry that the number of system defects
would be commensurate with number of lines of code and their complexity. To
that end, ICL Pathway conducted program specification and code reviews
followed by rigorous and comprehensive testing. This comprised of unit and
link testing, system testing, technical and non-functional testing, integration
and end to end testing (E2E), model office testing (MOT) and rehearsals and
finally live trials, all these were designed to progressively sift out errors and
defects and confirm that the solution was robust and satisfied the customer
requirements. Any areas of concern raised within the ICL Pathway solution
would be evaluated by the technical teams, discussed at the appropriate

management levels and addressed accordingly.

WITN04190100

Occasionally, the number/type of outstanding incidents would be a serious
cause for concern. One such view is documented in POL00028429
[WITN0419_01/6] and is related to the interface with the POCL TIP system, but
this simply reflects an uneasiness shown by those present that they may not all
be satisfactorily resolved in the timescales required. If that had been the
outcome, the system would not have achieved ‘acceptance’ and resulted in the

inevitable delay to the start of rollout.

A decision to ‘workaround’ an issue would be made if a defect could not be
fixed in time for the next scheduled software release. However, if it was not
possible or acceptable to develop a manual workaround then the release
would be delayed until the software could be fixed and the outcome verified.
All ‘workarounds’ were agreed with POCL and fully documented at each

release.

| was not aware of the bugs, errors and defects in the POCL systems, or the
processes adopted to manage them unless it was an interface issue with a
ICL Pathway module. On the other hand, POCL were made aware of every

defect in the ICL Pathway solution and its progress through to resolution.

Turning to rollout phase, Mike Coombs was responsible for the ICL/Fujitsu
elements of the actual rollout, | was responsible for developing the software to
support the process and | left many months before rollout was completed.
However, the rollout was technically and logistically extremely challenging, over
19,000 locations were involved and over 30,000 desktop terminals (Tills) to be
installed at a rate of approx. 300 post offices per week. It demanded meticulous

planning and preparation, rapid escalation of incidents and their resolution and

14 of 20

35.

36.

WITN04190100

WITN04190100

purpose-built software to satisfy this requirement. The timing and pace of rollout
was defined in the contract and as far as | can remember this never changed. |
was not privy to the factors which influenced the speed of deployment, but |
understand from the NAO report RLIT0000001 [WITN0419_01/‘] that it was

driven by the DSS Business case for card payments.

The rollout of Horizon commenced once formal acceptance of the ICL Pathway
system had been achieved. To do this it was necessary to provide evidence
that every functional requirement had been met, that all the necessary system
documentation had been produced, that every priority defect had been
resolved or an acceptable ‘workaround’ was available and that all the system
engineering processes were documented and had achieved ISO 9001
standards confirmed by independent verification and certification. _ POCL’s
success/acceptance criteria was defined in POL00029137 [WITN0419_01/4]
plus later revisions, and had these not been met at the time, rollout would not

have commenced.

POCL were certainly aware of all the outstanding issues in the ICL Pathway
solution, but | cannot confirm that they were aware of all the issues within the
Horizon system. Any concerns raise by POCL would have been addressed and
resolved, had this not been the case, rollout would have been delayed until they
were. A Release Notice and Known Problem Register (KPR) would have been

published for the ICL Pathway software version used for the rollout.

| was not aware of any political pressure to commence roll-out when it did, this
was determined simply by the readiness and robustness of the software. As

far as | can recall, that during the period before | left the programme, it was

15 of 20

WITN04190100

WITN04190100

considered a huge success. That is not to say that it was without incident, but
these were dealt with promptly and effectively to enable rollout to continue at

the required pace.

This was one of the largest IT systems in the world and ICL Pathway was set
up by Fujitsu/ICL to specifically manage, develop, integrate and rollout their
solution. In addition to using their own resources they recruited specialist

expertise where necessary.

Throughout the programme ICL and Fujitsu senior management were
appraised of progress, risks and issues on a regular basis. In addition, all the
partners met monthly at the Suppliers Forum to review progress,
dependencies and issues, each company represented by their Managing
Director or Chief Executive. Any areas of concern would be evaluated by the
various technical teams, discussed at the appropriate management levels and
addressed by devising a detailed corrective action plan followed by close

monitoring of the outcome.

In the months prior to rollout, Fujitsu personnel came over from Japan to help
with testing and defect management and reported daily back to senior Fujitsu

personnel.

Resourcing for ICL Pathway was a constant issue due to the large staffing
numbers and skills required but where shortfalls did arise every effort was

made, including long hours and weekends, to ensure that the critical
milestones were still achieved. In addition, the manpower was a mixture of
permanent and contract staff which enabled the team to respond quickly to
demands. However, there were occasions where specific activities were

16 of 20

41.

42.

43.

WITN04190100

WITN04190100

adversely impacted by unexpected resignations and shortages in the

marketplace causing the lower-level tasks to be replanned.

The talent and expertise in most disciplines in the very large ICL Pathway team
was exceptional and, in some instances, the best available in the IT industry.
Where specific knowledge and skill was required, ICL Pathway joined forces
with companies (partners) who were experts in their field. Oracle UK for
database systems, Microsoft for Windows based expertise, Energis for network
communications, CISCO, Fujitsu, EMC, Sequent/IBM for Hardware, Tivoli/IBM

for systems management and WTplc for post office surveys and preparations.

The company adopted best IT practice, processes, products and tools for
reporting, planning and progress monitoring, to manage risk, to control change,
for configuration management, to assist testing and introduced a transparent
internal audit process to enhance the quality control and assurance procedures.
| have worked with other major IT integrators such as EDS, BT, IBM and CSC
and in my opinion, they were no more equipped to take on a programme of this

magnitude.

| am not able to say whether the oversight from Government or senior POCL
management was sufficient for a system of this enormity and significance, but
I can say that the level of POCL intervention and assurance activities in the ICL
Pathway processes and deliverables was considerable in the second haif of the
programme as shown in an early version of the Horizon Plan for Acceptance

POL00029137 [WITN0419_01/4).

GENERAL

44.

45.

Over 20 years have elapsed since | left the programme, so it is difficult to recall
aspects that Fujitsu/ ICL may have done differently. In hindsight, taking on a
project without an agreed functional requirement, with such a large number of
‘agreements to agree’ and with so many customer contractual obligations to
fulfil (CARs — Contracting Authorities Responsibilities), was high risk. The level
of ‘requirements creep’ was substantial, causing ICL Pathway to be reactive,
constantly recruiting more resources and continually evolving. The final

solution which achieved customer acceptance bore little resemblance to the

original requirement defined in the Invitation to Tender (ITT).

| do believe that there was an overriding sense of achievement and pride
amongst the majority of those who were involved in the ICL Pathway solution.
It required great deal of technical expertise, commitment, determination and
sheer hard work to overcome all the obstacles and challenges that were faced
by the team but at no stage did | feel that we would deliver a poor quality
product. All the known defects were listed at the start of rollout and these were
scheduled to be fixed in later releases. The system architecture and complex
functionality was impressive and would bear scrutiny by any external
organisation at the time. The acceptance process was both comprehensive and
demanding and the quantity and quality of the system documentation produced

was exceptional.
