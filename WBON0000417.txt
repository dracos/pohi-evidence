Thanks Andy — are BD available to speak with NBSC (Kendra?) to obtain the necessary info for the cases your have
highlighted? Kendra was interviewed by Jonathan Swift QC as part of the Review so should be up to speed with
what is going on. I can however arrange a call if that would help?

In terms of the cases you have highlighted, I also wondered whether we should / are able to investigate:

@ M001: The calls logs that detail a “Complaint” of which there are one - do we know what that complaint
was in respect of?

MO35: the call handler who took the call on 23 Dec 2003 — this is the call cited as having caused the
discrepancy to have doubled?

M042: Similar to M035, there is an allegation that mis advice led to the doubling of discrepancy. This is
said to have occurred on 01.06.2011. Are we able to identify this call & the call handler?

MO80: Does the letter of 5 May 2009, details the calls in which he received “conflicting advice”?

M143: Are we able to identify the call handler that took the call on 03 June 2009?

Patrick

Please find attached the updated schedule of helpline complaints which now includes (i) comments on helplines from
the POIRs and CRRs and (ii) NBSC call refs where available.

I think the cases to focus on are M007, M045 and M144 where there are direct allegation of incompetence in the
helpline staff (allegations are highlighted in green).

The next step is to identify the call handlers at NBSC from the call ref numbers. The call logs I have seen don't show
the name of the call handler. I suspect this info needs to be pulled from the call logging system in NBSC. If we can
help with this, please let me know but I suspect that this is probably an internal job for POL.

Kind regards

Please find attached a schedule showing those cases where a specific helpline complaint has been made.

16 of the cases provide sufficiently detailed information to allow a further investigation (highlighted in green).

11 more cases elude to a call happening in a particular week or month from which one could probably try to find the
details of the call from the POL call logs but this could require a lot of extra work (highlighted in yellow).

I would just look at the green cases as the yellow ones will require a degree of guesswork to identify the exact call. I
would also only look for calls to NBSC as I suspect POL will not have access to the HR records of employees on the
HSD (as this was operated by Fujitsu; now ATOS).

In terms of next steps, my suggestion would be:

1. Review the NBSC call logs for each green case to try to identify any relevant NBSC call reference ID numbers.

2. For each identified call, review the POIR and CRR to determine what has been said about these calls / issues
already.

3. From the call ref number POL should then be able to identify the call handler at NBSC and can make enquiries
about those call handlers.

I can offer some paralegals to help conduct 1 and 2 above if that would help.

Kind regards
Andy

Hi Andy,
I just tried to call but went through to your voicemail so, in the first instance, I thought I would send you a note.

As I think you are aware, the Chairman has now received the report from Jonathan Swift QC. This report contains a
number of recommendations, including for us to:

“cross reference specific complaints about misleading advice from NBSC call-handlers with the possible employees
who provided that advice and consider their personnel files, where available, for evidence as to the likelihood that
the complaint may be well founded”.

Our proposal to address this, as agreed with Jonathan, is for those Applicants who raised complaints in respect of
helpline:

e — Identify those who have particularised their complaint e.g. given a specific date
Cross reference these calls against the call handler who would have taken the call

eCheck these call handlers PDRs to see if they had had any complaints made against them, in respect of the
advice they were providing.

Where we need your help, or rather your team of paralegal’s, is for them to trawl through the 107 cases that make
complaints in respect of the helpline (see column N of the attached spread sheet) and identify those which have
actually made particularised complaints rather than just generic ones.

As this is for the Chairman, we would like this done ASAP. When do you think you would be able to provide this
analysis by?
