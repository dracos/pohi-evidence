SCHEDULE B1.3

BRANCH HARDWARE IMPLEMENTATION SERVICES

DEFINITIONS

In this Schedule B1.3 the term Branch shall have the same meaning as set out in
Schedule1 (Interpretation), save that where Implementation activities occur in respect of
other premises such as, without limitation, CTOs, the term Branch in this Schedule B1.3
shall, in respect of such Implementations, be read to include such premises.

INTRODUCTION

This Schedule B1.3 sets out provisions and governing principles regarding the
Implementation of Branch Hardware and Stand-Alone Hardware.

HARDWARE IMPACT ASSESSMENT

Where Post Office wishes to carry out the Implementation of Branch Hardware it shall
procure a Hardware Impact Assessment from Fujitsu Services.

Where Post Office wishes to carry out the Implementation of Stand-Alone Hardware it
may procure a Hardware Impact Assessment from Fujitsu Services.

Where Hardware Impact Assessments for Branch Hardware or Stand-Alone Hardware
are procured in accordance with paragraphs 3.1 or 3.2 of Schedule B1.3, such
Hardware Impact Assessments shall be carried out by the Parties jointly.

IMPLEMENTATION OF BRANCH HARDWARE AND STAND-ALONE HARDWARE

Where following Hardware Impact Assessment Post Office decides to proceed with
Implementation and procure the applicable Branch Hardware or Stand-Alone Hardware
Post Office shall either:

4.1.1 procure the entire Implementation (other than elements specifically reserved to
Post Office) from Fujitsu Services; or

4.1.2 procure certain of those elements of the Implementation from Fujitsu Services
and either carry out the remaining elements itself or contract with third parties to
do so.

The table set out in the Annex to this Schedule sets out a non-exhaustive list of those
elements of the Implementation of Branch Hardware or Stand-Alone Hardware which
may be carried out by Post Office, Fujitsu Services and third parties.

Where Fujitsu Services is intended to carry out the whole, or any element, of the
Implementation of Branch Hardware (including a Hardware Impact Assessment and
related planning activities) the Work Ordering Procedure shall be used for the relevant
Work Package Elements and the provisions of paragraph 5 of this Schedule shall apply

to such Implementation in addition to the Commercial Terms agreed as part of the
relevant Work Order. In the event of any conflict between such Commercial Terms and
the provisions of this Schedule, the Commercial Terms shall prevail.

Where Fujitsu Services is intended to carry out the whole, or any element, of the
Implementation of Stand-Alone Hardware, the Work Ordering Procedure shall apply and
the provisions of paragraph 5 shall apply as though references to “Branch Hardware”
were to "Stand-Alone Hardware".

Where any third party carries out the whole, or any element, of the Implementation of
Branch Hardware or Stand-Alone Hardware, the provisions of paragraph 6 of this

Schedule shall apply to such Implementation.

PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO ELEMENTS OF IMPLEMENTATION PROVIDED BY
FUJITSU SERVICES

Charges
Fujitsu Services’ prices for Implementation, or any element of Implementation, shall be

based, unless otherwise agreed by the Parties, on the principles set out in paragraph
13.4 of Schedule D1.

Liability, Risk And Title

Where Fujitsu Services (or its chosen third party supplier) carries out Installation it shall
be liable for any damage to:

5.2.1 physical property (including, for the avoidance of doubt, damage to the
Infrastructure) together with any reasonable costs incurred by Post Office in
repairing such damage (including the cost of work involved); and

5.2.2 data (in which case Fujitsu Services is responsible for retrieving such data),

which occurs at a Branch as a direct result of such Installation work.

Non-technical support

For each Installation Post Office shall provide non-technical operational support (e.g
access to Branches).

PROVISIONS APPLICABLE WHERE ELEMENTS OF IMPLEMENTATION PROVIDED
BY POST OFFICE OR A THIRD PARTY

Commercial/Contractual Relationship

The commercial/contractual relationship between Post Office, Fujitsu Services and any
third party supplier, including the charges payable to Fujitsu Services by Post Office,
shall be agreed on a case by case basis for each Implementation. The parties may
adopt whatever commercial/contractual structure is appropriate for the particular

circumstances. However, the commercial/contractual arrangement must take into
account the impact on the systems and services provided to Post Office by Fujitsu
Services. Fujitsu Services shall not unreasonably refuse to accept proposed
commercial/contractual terms for the Implementation of Branch Hardware or Stand-
Alone Hardware. Fujitsu Services may base its decision to reject proposed terms on
commercial and/or an adverse outcome of Hardware Impact Assessment.

Branch Hardware Procurement

Until 31st March 2015, where Post Office procures Branch Hardware from a third party, a
warranty clause (the terms of which shall be agreed with Fujitsu Services, such
agreement not to be unreasonably withheld) must form part of the purchase agreement
for the Branch Hardware between the Post Office and the third party. Until 31st March
2015, prior to physical transfer of the Branch Hardware to Fujitsu Services or
incorporation of the Branch Hardware into the Infrastructure (whichever is earlier) Post
Office shall use reasonable endeavours to transfer to Fujitsu Services the benefit of and
right to the third party warranty provisions.

Installation

6.3.1 Fujitsu Services shall not unreasonably refuse to give Post Office, or its
designated supplier, the authority to disconnect and reconnect elements of the
Infrastructure at Branches as part of an Installation.

6.3.2 Where Post Office (or its chosen third party supplier) carries out Installation it
shall be liable for any damage to physical property or data which occurs at a
Branch (including, for the avoidance of doubt, damage to the Infrastructure) as
a direct result of such Installation work.

6.3.3 Notwithstanding paragraph 6.3.2, where Post Office or its third party supplier
carries out Installation work, Fujitsu Services shall be liable for any damage to
the Infrastructure or data in accordance with paragraph 5.2 where:

6.3.3.1 such damage occurred as a result of the Post Office or its chosen third
party supplier carrying out such Installation work in accordance with
installation specifications provided by Fujitsu Services;

6.3.3.2 the damage would not have occurred if the Fujitsu Services installation
specifications had not been followed; and

6.3.3.3 Post Office or its third party supplier acted in the manner of a
reasonable and skilled provider of Installation services in following the
installation specifications.
