Hi David
As just discussed, please see below the line we have reissued on the Horizon queries

from the BBC. I/ll talk to George once he’s back about our issuing an updated statement
later in the week, in response to the BBC’s ongoing requests for a further NFSP response

to some of their specific claims.

Speak soon!

We have complete confidence in the Horizon system, which carries out hundreds of
millions of transactions every week at 12,000 Post Office outlets across the country.
The NFSP has seen no evidence to suggest that Horizon has been at fault — we believe it
to be robust, as does Post Office Ltd, with whom we have regular discussions on the
system.
