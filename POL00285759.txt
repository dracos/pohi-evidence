Dear Sirs

Post Office Group Action
Horizon Issues Trial - Defendant's Stage 3 Disclosure

We refer to your letter of 19 September 2018.

As an overarching response to your letter, Post Office has undertaken its disclosure exercise in a
transparent manner and sought to assist the Claimants by providing additional information and
assistance where possible.

In contrast, the Claimants have failed to engage with the concerns that Post Office has raised about the
methods by which the Claimants’ have undertaken their disclosure, which have included the application
of redactions, the multiples rounds of delayed disclosure and the scope of Stage 3 Disclosure. Those
concerns have now been raised on numerous occasions, and most recently in our second and third
letters of 12 September 2018 to which we are yet to receive a response.

We note that the majority of the queries in your letter of 19 September 2018 could have been answered
without assistance from Post Office, simply by using the facilities available through your e-disclosure
platform to search the documents and metadata we have disclosed. We have been able to respond to
your queries on that basis. Before raising concerns and queries about the disclosure provided by Post
Office, please analyse the information, data and documents which have already been provided. The
time and effort required to respond to your queries is a matter which will be raised when the costs of
disclosure fall to be considered.

4. DATE RANGES FOR STAGE 3 DISCLOSURE

$1 Your letter raises concerns that a limited number of documents have been disclosed by Post
Office within the relevant date periods and sets out, by reference to the various tranches of
disclosure, the date periods in which you believe limited disclosure has been provided. We have
addressed below each of the document sets with which you raise concern.

Known Error Log ("KEL") (disclosed on 10 May 2018)

12 As explained in our letter of 9 May 2018, the KEL entries are stored in Fujitsu's proprietary
database. Fujitsu extracted the documents from this database, which were then uploaded to our

e-disclosure platform. None of the KEL entries which were extracted by Fujitsu and provided to
us were withheld from disclosure on the basis of privilege or relevancy.

1.3 Your letter states that fewer than 30 documents in this category have been disclosed in each
year from 2000 — 2003. Using the document dates of the KEL entries, the data below has been
extracted from our e-disclosure platform, which shows that a far greater number of documents
between these date ranges have in fact been disclosed. For completeness, we have included a
full list of date ranges. The metadata containing the document date was provided to you during
disclosure and is readily available for you to analyse in your e-disclosure platform.

1.4 As brought to your attention in our letter of 9 May 2018, due to the nature in which the
documents are stored, it was not possible to extract the creation and revision dates. However, to
ensure that the dates of the KEL entries were available for analysis, Post Office incurred
additional expense in extracting the document dates contained within the KEL entries and

overlaying this information onto each of the documents metadata in the data room. Post Office
took steps to ensure that the Claimants were able to undertake their own analysis of the date
ranges and we expected such analysis would be undertaken before issues are raised with us.

Claimants’ request for Horizon Technical Documents (disclosed on 10 April 2018)

The documents disclosed within this batch were the 100 documents selected by the Claimants
pursuant to paragraph 7 of the Third CMC Order. Post Office provided disclosure of the specific
documents sought by the Claimants and did not therefore control the date ranges which these
fell within. Having disclosed to you the documents you requested, we do not understand what
legitimate criticism you can make. Nevertheless, if the Claimants wished to be provided with
documents within the 1996-2003 date range, they could have requested them six months ago.

Horizon Technical Disclosure (disclosed on 18 July 2018)

Your letter confirms that 47 documents were disclosed on 18 July 2018 which were part of the
Horizon Technical Disclosure. As explained below, the Horizon Technical Disclosure Post Office
provided on this date was formed of documents sourced from Dimensions that had previously
been withheld from inspection on the concern that they contained privileged material.

As explained in our letter of 17 May 2018, through keyword searching it was identified that
10,758 (32,702 when families are included) of the documents stored within Dimensions (which
was the source of the Horizon Technical Disclosure) may contain privileged material and
inspection of these documents was not provided. However, a list of the documents withheld was
provided to you at that time. By way of our letters of 17 May, 17 July and 23 July 2018 an
invitation was given that if there were a small number of non-disclosed Dimensions documents
which the Claimants’ Expert wished to review, then we would be open to reviewing these on an
individual basis. This same opportunity was also open to Dr Worden.

In relation to the 47 documents disclosed on 18 July 2018, Dr Worden had identified a small
number of the Dimensions documents which fell within the above pool and which were of
interest to him. As per the open invitation to the Claimants’ Expert, following Dr Worden's
request for these documents, they were reviewed for privilege and provided to Dr Worden. To
ensure equality of information between the parties' experts these documents were then provided
to you by way of further disclosure.

Whilst the disclosure provided on 18 July 2018 was a small number of documents from a limited
date range, this disclosure cannot be taken in isolation from the wider class of Horizon Technical
Disclosure of which it was part (being technical documents regarding Horizon stored by Fujitsu in
its Dimensions system). Post Office has provided disclosure of approximately 112,000
documents within this class spanning from 1995 to 2018, as follows:

Stage 3 Disclosure (disclosed on 3 July, 18 July, 2 August and 28 August 2018)

1.10 The remaining document sets which you raise concerns with form part of Stage 3 Disclosure.
Your letter seeks to consider each disclosure list in isolation from the other disclosure lists by
raising concerns that limited documents from particular years were provided in each list. These
stages of disclosure cannot be considered in isolation from each other. For example, whilst one
Stage 3 Disclosure list may contain no, or limited, documents from 2003, these documents may
be included within another Stage 3 Disclosure list.

1.11 Your letter asks for us to set out the process of identifying, reviewing and disclosing relevant
documents for Stage 3 Disclosure and confirm why there appears to be such a limited number of
documents disclosed in each stage during relevant periods. In our letters of 22 June, 1 August
and 10 August 2018 we have already provided detailed explanations of the steps taken in
relation to each class of document. We will not repeat in this letter information already been
provided to you.

2. THIRD PARTY REPORTS
241 Since the requests in your letter for disclosure of third party reports refer to particular documents

within an identified date range, Post Office will take steps to locate these documents and provide
disclosure of them. It should be noted that the scope of this disclosure will be to the reports

AC_151922725_2 4

POL-BSFF-0123822_0003
POL00285759
POL00285759

which you have specifically referred to in your requests and not a broader search for all third
party reports which have been produced. We anticipate that locating and reviewing these
documents will take a couple of weeks and we will provide an update shortly.

3. FURTHER DISCLOSURE

3.4 Your letter requests disclosure of documents which relate to the incidents and issues referred to
in POL-0171024 and POL-0217341. As currently drafted, your requests for disclosure do not
enable Post Office to make targeted searches for documents that would relate to these matters.
So that Post Office can understand and consider the further disclosure which you now seek,
please provide your requests in the form of a Model C request, specifying either a particular or
narrow class of document relating to a particular Issue for Disclosure, as required under the
Disclosure Pilot for the Business and Property Courts.

3.2 We note your comments on the redaction of POL-0171022. As explained in section 3 of our
letter of 5 September 2018, some of the documents disclosed in Stage 3 Disclosure were reports
to Post Office's Board of Directors and Group Executive and the minutes arising from their
meetings. POL-0171022 was one of these documents. The documents submitted to these
groups and committees (and the minutes and actions arising therefrom) cover a multitude of
matters which are being brought to their attention, only one of which is Horizon. The non-relevant
information contained within such documents was therefore redacted on the basis that it was
irrelevant to any issue in these proceedings and was confidential. Further, some of the contents
of these documents would also be covered by legal privilege.

4, FUJITSU ADVICE

441 We note that your request for disclosure relates to the operation of POLSAP. We shall be writing
separately on this topic shortly.

5. DOCUMENT VERSIONS

6.1 As previously expressed in our letter of 28 June 2018, the claim being brought against Post
Office spans a period of 20 years and touches upon the majority of Post Office network
operations. It would neither be reasonable nor proportionate for Post Office to undertake a
disclosure exercise which would necessarily locate every document (and versions of that
document) which has ever been created over that 20 year period.

5.2 The Disclosure Pilot was in large part adopted for that reason, which required Post Office to
undertake a reasonable and proportionate search for specified classes of documents. Post
Office has done so. For Post Office to locate all versions of every document would require it to
search an enormous number of sources where drafts / previous versions of documents could be
stored (for example, it would require the extraction of email accounts for numerous individuals
who may have circulated for comment draft documents which may have not been saved to a
shared location).

5.3 Nevertheless, in relation to your 37 requests for disclosure of all versions of a document, 33 of
your requests relate to documents which were sourced from Dimensions (Fujitsu's technical
document repository). For these documents there are a number of methods by which the
Claimants’ could have undertaken their own analysis and confirmed that disclosure of all
versions had been provided.

5.3.1 An index of the documents within Dimensions was provided to you on 21 November
2017 (Dimensions Index). The Dimensions Index contained a list of the documents
stored in Dimensions, but importantly also confirmed the different versions of each
document that were stored in Dimensions. The Claimants have therefore been made
aware of the versions of these documents that exist.

5.3.2 Each document sourced from Dimensions has a unique reference code (ie.
CS/PRO/144) which is also part of the file name metadata (ie. CSPRO144_0.1.doc). A
search in your e-disclosure platform for documents which have a name similar to

AC_151922725_2 5

POL-BSFF-0123822_0004
POL00285759
POL00285759

"CSPRO144" would have brought to your attention all versions of this document that
had been disclosed.

5.3.3 Each document sourced from Dimensions contains a version number. This can be
located in either the file name (ie. "CSPRO144_0.1.doc" — this is version 0.1 of the
document), or within the contents of the documents. Each of the documents contains
a document control / document history section which lists the versions which have
been produced. A brief review of this section would have allowed you to confirm
whether there were any versions which have not been disclosed.

5.3.4 As explained in paragraph 1.7 above, a number of the documents sourced from
Dimensions were not provided for inspection. A list of these documents was however
provided and there remains an open invitation to request inspection of these
documents if required by the Claimants’ Expert. If there were particular versions of a
document which were not provided for inspection, then it was open to you to review the
list and request inspection. 6 of your 37 requests fall within this category and it was
known to you why inspection of these documents had not been provided.

5.4 As shown from the above, the knowledge of the versions in existence and the versions which
have been disclosed / provided for inspection was openly provided to you. Post Office and the
Claimants have access to the same information and are able to undertake the same analysis.
From an analysis of the documents disclosed and the Dimensions Index you could have easily
confirmed whether any versions which were stored within Dimensions had not been disclosed.

5.5 In responding to your requests, we have been required to undertake this analysis on your behalf.
For 26 of your requests, Post Office has already provided disclosure of all versions listed within
the Dimensions Index and there was no basis on which to make requests for further disclosure.

5.6 it should be kept in mind that Post Office was required to provide disclosure of "technical
documents regarding Horizon stored by Fujitsu in Dimensions systems". \f a version of a
document sourced from Dimensions systems is held in an alternative source (ie. attached to an
email), then Post Office was not ordered to search and give disclosure of such documents.

57 Before making further requests of this nature, please confirm that you have conducted
appropriate searches and checks of the documents and metadata which has already been
disclosed (and describe such searches and checks), and taken into account the requirement for
Post Office to have undertaken a reasonable and proportionate search for documents. Post
Office is willing to assist in the event that your queries cannot be answered on the basis of the
information already provided. However, if it later transpires that adequate documents / metadata
were available then Post Office reserves its rights to recover the costs incurred in responding to
your queries.

5.8 In this instance, we have considered each of your requests and our responses are contained at
Schedule 1 to this letter.

Yours faithfully
