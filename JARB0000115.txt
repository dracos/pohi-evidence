If Post Office refuse to send you copy of the Second Sight Part 2 Report, you need to write
back to the post Office asking them to state reasons why they have refused. Once you
receive this, if you disagree or wish to challenge their decision, you need to follow
instructions on the Information Commissioner's website.
