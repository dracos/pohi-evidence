      1. This witness statement is made to assist the Post Office Horizon IT inquiry (the

         "Inquiry") with the matters set out in the Rule 9 request dated 28 November

         2023 (the "Request")



      2. 1 can confirm I was assisted by the Post Office Limited ('POL") in confirming

         insurance coverage for support in preparing my statement. I have also been

         assisted by DAC Beachcroft LLP in the preparation and drafting of my

         statement.


p:!    1.u.1iIirop




         previously worked in a Sub-Post Office as a Sub-Office Assistant for

         approximately 4 years.     I was recruited following an entrance exam and a

         face-to-face interview.   My previous experience working in a Sub-Post Office

         meant that when I joined POL I already had transaction experience. As part
                                                                                 W ITN08480100
                                                                               W ITN 08480100




   of my induction I attended a 1-week training course that was bespoke for Sub-

   Office Assistants.   This was shorter than the normal induction due to my

   experience working in a Sub--Post Office.



4. Following my induction, I worked on the counter within the Crown Office

   Network for approximately 3 years.       During this time I worked mostly in

   Belfast Post Office but also provided cover in Bangor Post Office and

   Shaftesbury Square Post Office.     This role was as a Postal Officer grade

   performing counter duties.



5. In around 1990/91 I moved to the Belfast Audit Team where I worked as an

   Auditor. I initially worked in the team on a temporary basis providing cover for

   annual leave before I moved into a permanent role. This role was again a

   Postal Officer grade.


6. 1 spent the majority of my career working as an Auditor and although the job

   title changed through various reorganisations the role remained relatively the

   same.   I did receive several promotions during this time and also moved into

   a training role when a reorganisation brought the Training and Audit Team

   together. I cannot recall the exact dates when I changed roles, but I have

   contacted the POL HR team who have assisted with some of the dates.            I

   have listed below the specific roles I had during this time and a brief

   explanation of each role:
                                                                              W ITN08480100
                                                                          W ITN 08480100




a. 1991 to 1996 (approx.) — Auditor/Network Auditor — Responsible for

     conducting asset verification and compliance audits at Post Office

     Branches as determined by the audit schedule.



b. 1996 (approx.) — Retail Network Manager — This was a temporary

     position covering maternity leave.    I was the point of contact for a

     section of Post Offices in Northern Ireland. After 9 months I returned to

     my substantive Audit role which I held until 2002.


c. April 2002 to July 2002 — Performance Advisor — I was promoted to a

     CM3 grade and was responsible for approximately 80 Community

     Offices in Northern Ireland.


d. 2002 — mid-2010 — Senior Auditor (CM3 grade) — I was responsible for

     assisting and leading asset verification and compliance audits at Post

     Office branches as determined by the audit schedule.


e. Mid-2010 — Dec-2010 — Field Support Team Leader (Grade 2A) —

     Responsible for Auditors in Northern Ireland. I also had responsibility

     for Auditors in other geographical areas during this time including

     Liverpool, Manchester, Glasgow and Edinburgh.            I still actively

     completed audits in addition to having line management responsibility.


f.   Jan 2011 — Audit and Training Team Leader (Grade 2A) — Following a

     reorganisation a new team was created based in Northern Ireland and

     Scotland which amalgamated the previous Audit Team and Training

     Team. I was responsible for the delivery of the audit and training
                                                                                W ITN08480100
                                                                              W ITN 08480100




          programme to branches.      This was mostly a line management role

          which I recall was for a team of approx. 10 to 12 people.        Duties

          included Quality Assurance Reviews for Audit activity and onsite visits

          at branches during a Subpostmaster's initial training.      My job title

          reverted back to Field Team Leader in October 2012.


      g. October 2012 (approx.) — Area Manager (Grade 3B) — This was a

          unique role in Northern Ireland. The role was essentially Field Team

          Leader but also provided additional capacity during the Network

          Transformation programme.



7. l left POL in October 2016.



8. The Inquiry has asked about my role in relation to disciplinary matters. As an

   Auditor I did not get involved in any branch disciplinary matters. Disciplinary

   issues or concerns that were highlighted at a Sub-Post Office audit would be

   escalated to the Retail Network Manager or the Contract Manager (these titles

   changes during the years) for action. For Crown Offices this would be the

   Crown Area Manager.       My only role would be in providing information to the

   relevant persons following an audit, but I would not be involved in any

   discussions or decisions regarding disciplinary action.


9. The Inquiry has asked me about any involvement I had in interviewing those

   accused of a criminal offence and my role in litigation case strategy. I cannot

   recall any involvement I had in either area.     From memory I would expect

   interviewing to be conducted by the Security and Investigation Team. I have
                                                                                  W ITN08480100
                                                                                W ITN 08480100




   no recollection of litigation case strategy and do not know what was required

   by POL in this respect or who was responsible for it.



10. The Inquiry has asked me about my role in disclosure in criminal and civil

   proceedings.   I am not sure what is meant by disclosure and 1 do not recall

   having any involvement in disclosure during my time at POL. I do recall I was

   asked to make statements following an audit which I understand were for the

   purpose of criminal proceedings.     I was also sometimes asked to provide

   documents to other POL teams, for example the Investigation Team or

   Contracts Manager may request a copy of an audit report.


11. The Inquiry has asked me what role I had in liaising with other POL

   departments in respect of the progress of cases.        I would liaise with other

   teams as part of my role within the Audit Team. In particular I would liaise

   with the Security and Investigations Team who may have an interest in the

   result of an audit and require a statement from me for their investigation.     I

   would also liaise with Contract Advisors and provide them with details of the

   audit and the audit report as requested.      There may be other teams that

   would ask for similar information, but I can no longer recall any specific

   details.




12. As noted above, my role changes during my time in the Audit team and at

   various times I held the job title of Auditor, Senior Auditor, Audit Manager and

   Field Team Leader. During an audit my role would either involve assisting or
                                                                                   W I TN08480100
                                                                                 WI TN 08480100




   leading an audit of a Post Office branch.      In essence the process would

   involve ascertaining what assets were held at the branch and comparing this

   to the reported cash, stock and vouchers. The Auditors would also complete

   a series of compliance checks to ensure that the Post Office procedures were

   being adhered to.



13. Whilst there were a number of processes and policies in place, I can no

   longer recall their details or when they changed.    I do recall that when I first

   joined the Audit Team there was a manual system in place which later

   changed to a computerised system with the implementation of Horizon. The

   processes followed by the Auditors were updated to reflect this new practice.




14. The Inquiry has asked me to consider the following documents:

      a. "Assurance Review - Recruitment (Vetting & Training)" (version 1.0, 27

          October 2009) (POL00032698);

      b. "Network      auditing   approach,   methods   and    assurance"    (2013)

         (POL00086765);

      c. "Training & Audit Advisor" (undated) (POL00088453);

      d. "Audit Advisor" (undated) (POL00088557).



15. In regard to the Assurance Review (POL00032698), I do not recall seeing this

   document previously.     I also do not recall the document "Network auditing

   approach, methods and assurance' (POL00086765).            They may have been

   considered by Senior Management rather than my grade. I do not recall ever
                                                                                W ITN08480100
                                                                              W ITN 08480100




   being involved in the external recruitment process and I believe this would

   have been completed by the HR Team.

16. The other two documents, POL Training & Audit Advisor" (undated)

   (POL00088453) and "Audit Advisor" (undated) (POL00088557) are both job

   adverts. I do not recall seeing these documents previously, but the contents

   look to describe the key elements of each role.


17. From what I can recall Auditors tended to be recruited internally following an

   internal job advert.     From memory it was usually Postal Officers who worked

   in Crown Offices that were recruited to the roles. There was no specific audit

   qualification required but a working knowledge of POL transactions and

   procedures would be listed as a requirement on the job advert.


18. When in the role an Auditor would receive training in various forms.     New

   Auditors would initially shadow other team members and would be allocated a

   buddy to support their development.      I remember when I was a line manager

   I would develop a training plan for a new team member which would introduce

   them to different aspects of the role and allow me to monitor their progress

   and ability to complete each task.


19. Auditors would        receive further training as significant changes were

   introduced.   For example, when car tax moved from a paper based to

   computerised system specific training was received. This training could take

   different forms depending on the requirements and included classroom

   training, workbooks, videos and various policy and process documents. I do

   not recall any refresher training that was provided to Auditors and the

   fundamental process remained relatively the same. I recall that when Horizon
                                                                                W ITNO8480100
                                                                              W ITN 08480100




   was introduced the Auditors were provided with specific training.     I do not

   recall the exact details but from memory there were two courses rolled out

   across the business. There was a 1-day course for individuals working on the

   counter and a 2/3 day course for individuals with back-office responsibilities.

   The Auditors would have attended the longer course.


20. The Inquiry has asked me if I considered then and now whether the Auditors

   had the necessary training and experience during my time at POL. I do not

   have any concerns and believe the Auditors had the necessary training and

   experience for the requirements of the role.




21. 1 remember there were a number of different types of audits. This included

   planned audits, for example, where a branch was closing or transferring to a

   new Subpostmaster, and unplanned audits, for example, where there had

   been a robbery or burglary, or the Investigation team required an audit of a

   specific branch.   These types of audits remained relatively consistent during

   my time in the team.



22. However, I can recall that the way in which other audits were scheduled

   changed during my time in the Audit Team.        When ! started in the team

   branches were audited on a calendar-based system. This meant each branch

   would be audited on a set frequency which would be determined by their size,

   products and how busy they were.      Under this system some branches may

   be audited annually whereas others would be every two years.
                                                                                 W ITN08480100
                                                                               W ITN 08480100




23, 1 can see from the document Audit Plan & Scheduling, Chapter 1 of the Audit

   Process Manual" (Version 8.0) (2010) (POL00084650) that the method of

   planning changed in May 2004 when the Financial Branch Performance

   Profile was introduced. This was a risk-based system which meant branches

   would be audited based on their risk rating, which took into consideration

   specific factors, rather than a set schedule.


24. By the time I left in 2016 1 can remember the risk-based audits involved two

   parts:


      a. A Financial Assurance Audit (FAA) — This was an audit of all cash,

            selected stock items and vouchers which would be counted by the

            Auditor. If this showed any discrepancies the audit could be upgraded

            to a Tier 2 audit which would include all stock items.



      b. A Compliance Audit — This would check the branches compliance with

            the Post Office procedures and following up on any gaps from previous

            audits.


25. How an audit was scheduled depended on the type of audit that was

   required. Audits for transfers and closures of Post Offices were scheduled in

   advance with the agreement of the incoming/outgoing Subpostmaster.

   Special audits were usually instigated by the Security and Investigation Team

   and would be arranged for a specific date.          Risk audits were determined

   based on the availability and resources in the Audit Team.          Compliance

   audits and follow up audits would usually be completed as a second audit of
                                                                                 W ITNO8480100
                                                                               W ITN 08480100




   the day.    All audits would be scheduled as soon as it was operationally

   possible.



26. The frequency a branch would be audited would be dependent on the type of

   audit and the performance of the branch, i.e., the number of error notices,

   transaction corrections, cash and stock holdings etc.



27. The Inquiry has asked me to describe any enquires or investigations that

   were conducted before a branch visit. I cannot recall the exact details, but I

   do remember that before a special audit there would be a pre-audit meeting to

   make arrangements for the audit and to understand the reason for the audit.

   There would also be a discussion on the previous audit results for the branch

   in question.


28. The Inquiry has also asked me to describe any variation between the

   scheduling of audits in respect of Crown Office branches and other branches

   and to explain the reason for any differences. I do not recall if there were any

   different scheduling criteria based on the different branches.




29. When completing an audit, I would consider specific information which

   included the branches previous audit findings.   I would also be able to access

   specific information on the branch, for example, how much cash they were

   holding.       I believe an auditor could also access information on any

   transactions corrections that were due.   I recall there was a branch database

   which Auditors could access to view this information. It would be important to
                                                                                     W ITNO8480100
                                                                                  W ITN 08480100




   view and understand this information to aid with the planning and preparation

   of an audit.   I recall this would have been the case for any audit and would

   not have differed based on the type of branch.

30. If a discrepancy was discovered at an audit the Auditor would have an initial

   conversation with the Subpostmaster or their staff to determine if any items

   had not been produced and therefore still needed to be counted.        I recall that

   I would also check if any transaction corrections were due to be issued but I

   cannot now recall who provided this information.     Where a discrepancy was

   over £1000 I would also report this to the Contract Advisor.


31. The Inquiry has asked me whether I was aware of a practice in which

   Auditors asked Subpostmasters to make good discrepancies on the day of the

   audit. From what I now recall if I was completing a transfer audit and a

   discrepancy was found the Subpostmaster would be asked to make good the

   discrepancy so the new Subpostmaster could start with a clear balance. I do

   not recall asking a Subpostmaster to make good a shortage on other audits.

   If there was a small shortage I believe I would have had a conversation with

   them to make good the discrepancy on completion of their own balance/cash

   account/branch trading statement. If there was a significant shortage I would

   report this to the Contracts Manger or Crown Area Manager as would be the

   process.


32. The Inquiry has asked me whether I was aware of Auditors being given

   instructions on taking payments from Subpostmasters.           I do not recall this

   process, but I do recall that Auditors carried without prejudice receipts.       In

   some audits a Subpostmaster would request to make good the shortage.
                                                                                   W ITNO8480100
                                                                                 W ITN 08480100




   They would usually provide me with a cheque. In return I would provide a

   without prejudice receipt.   I believe this would be used in the event of a

   Subpostmaster receiving a precautionary suspension due to a shortage where

   they wrote a cheque for the discrepancy.    I cannot recall the exact wording,

   but I believe it explained that the cheque was accepted without prejudice to

   any further action taken by POL.


33. The Inquiry has asked me whether, on discovery of a shortfall, the

   Subpostmaster was able to and/or permitted to provide their own information

   or undertake their own investigation.    From memory I recall that when the

   audit result was provided to the Subpostmaster they were offered the

   opportunity to check the audit figures.           I would expect any further

   investigation on their part would be discussed with the Investigation Team.


34. During the course of an audit the Auditors would provide information to the

   Subpostmaster. On arrival the Lead Auditor would discuss the type of audit

   and would discuss how best to set up for the audit within the branch.    They

   would advise the Subpostmaster that all cash, stock and vouchers would

   need to be produced and that the office could not open until permission was

   provided.   The Lead Auditor would also advise the Subpostmaster on the

   completion of each stage of the audit, informing them when the financial

   aspect was complete and then when the compliance checks had been

   completed, reporting the results at each stage.


35. A closing meeting was held with the Subpostmaster where the audit findings

   would be discussed.      The Subpostmaster was given the opportunity to

   discuss any concerns and raise any issues.        Where an issue was raised by
                                                                                 W ITN08480100
                                                                               W ITN 08480100




   the Subpostmaster it would be highlighted in the audit report, a hard copy of

   which was posted to the branch a few days after the audit. The Contract

   Advisor would receive a copy by email.       A feedback form would be left for

   completion at the end of the audit.


36. The Inquiry has asked me if it was possible to conduct a branch audit in

   circumstances in which it was not possible to access the Horizon IT system. I

   do not recall if this was possible, but I note from the document `'Post Incident

   Auditing without Horizon (POL00084003) that there is a process for auditing

   branches without access to Horizon. I can remember one audit I was involved

   in where a fire following an overnight burglary had damaged the Horizon

   equipment. In this audit we attempted to construct a balance within Belfast

   Cash Centre but could only count what was left and in the end we couldn't

   really construct a full balance.


37. I have also been asked by the Inquiry to describe any variations between the

   audit process in Crown Office branches in comparison to other branches and

   the reasons for those differences. I recall that in a Crown Office branch a

   minimum of 50% of stock was checked along with all dormant (non-assigned)

   stock and any stock held by the Branch Manager.          Also, in Crown Office

   branches where there was a loss in excess of £1,000, this would be escalated

   to the Crown Area Manager. A loss of £10,000 would also be escalated to the

   Security Manager. For audits outside the Crown Network, depending on the

   Audit Type, they would be subject to a Financial Assurance Audit, a Tier 2 or

   a Compliance Audit as mentioned above. An audit shortage of £1000 or more
                                                                                 W ITN08480100
                                                                               W ITN 08480100




   would be escalated to the Contracts Advisor while the Auditors were still

   onsite.


38. The Inquiry has asked me to consider two documents, the "Audit Trail

   Functional Specification" (version 8.0, 18 October 2004) (FUJ00001894) and

   Global User Account (September 2016) (POL00002841).             I cannot recall

   seeing these documents previously, but I do recall i had a Global User

   Account issued to me.     I cannot remember ever using it, but this may be

   because I was usually the Assistant Auditor rather than the Lead Auditor who

   would have taken on this responsibility.       As far as I can recall the Audit

   Global User Account would allow an Auditor access to log onto the Horizon

   system where they could be identified as a user. This would be used when

   there was nobody in branch with "Manager Access" to Horizon and would

   allow the reports to be sourced and printed. I do not recall the audit measures

   that were in place but note that POL00002841 explains the process for who

   would be given an account and the actions that were required. I cannot recall

   this process from my time in the Audit Team.


39. The Inquiry has asked me what involvement Fujitsu had in the audit process.

   I cannot recall any interactions with Fujitsu in the Audit process, and I am not

   aware of any involvement they had in completing an Audit.


40. The Inquiry has also asked me whether Auditors had access to any

   information which was not available to Subpostmasters.          I cannot recall

   anything from memory although I do remember that at one point Auditors

   were able to ring and check if any error notices or transaction corrections

   were imminent which I do not believe was available to Subpostmasters.

                                                                                W ITN 08480100




Audit and Investigation


   41. The Rule 9 Request has asked me to consider the document "Condensed

      Guide for Audit Attendance (version 2, October 2008) (POL00104821).          I

      understand from the Inquiry that the reference is incorrect and this should

      refer to document POL00084813.

   42. The Inquiry has asked me to consider the circumstances when an

      Investigator would attend the audit of a branch and the role they had at an

      audit.   From memory I can recall that special audits were requested by the

      Security team.    An Investigator may attend but not always and it may be

      sufficient for the Auditor to make them aware of the result or provide them

      with a copy of the audit report.


   43. There were occasions where an Investigator did attend the audit as part of

      the investigation they were conducting.      They would usually introduce

      themselves to the Subpostmaster and explain why they had requested an

      audit. The Investigator did not get involved in the audit and would usually

      remain in the back office with the Subpostmaster. At the end of the Audit the

      Lead Auditor would provide the results to the Investigator before the Auditors

      left.



   44. During my employment with POL, I worked with the Security Team in relation

      to requests for special audits they had requested. They may have been onsite

      during those special audits and they would also be my point of contact should

      witness statements be required as part of their investigation. I would also
                                                                                   W I TN08480100
                                                                                 W I TN 08480100




   have liaised with Security Team on an ad hoc basis with questions regarding

   Security procedures and equipment.




45. The Inquiry has asked me to provide a full account of my involvement in and

   recollection of the prosecution of Alan McLaughlin. The Inquiry has also asked

   a number of specific questions in relation to Mr McLaughlin's prosecution. I

   have endeavoured to answer these questions to the best of my knowledge

   and have considered the documents provided to me by the Inquiry. However,

   as the events are over 20 years ago, and I have not worked for POL for over 7

   years, I do not recall these events clearly.         I have provided as much

   information as possible in order to assist the Inquiry.



46. As noted above, the Inquiry has provide seventeen documents relating to the

   audit, prosecution and appeal of Mr McLaughlin. I have reviewed these

   documents and considered them in my response.             I note that the document

   named "The audit report p.176 to p.188 — Appendix L (AMCL0000031) does

   not appear to relate to the events of Mr McLaughlin's prosecution. This audit

   report is provided to Mrs L Archer, not Mr McLaughlin.          It is also dated 3

   September 2004. The Interview Transcripts (AMCL0000014) are dated 26

   July 2001; therefore, it appears that the Audit report which I have received

   (Audit Report p176 to p188 AMCL0000031) relates to a later audit. To clarify

   I was not the Lead Auditor or the audit dated 26 July 2001. This audit was

   led by Ina Crawford, and I was there to assist. Although I have not seen the
                                                                                W ITN08480100
                                                                              W ITN 08480100




   Audit Report from 26 July 2001, I expect this would have been written by the

   Lead Auditor, Ms Crawford.



47. 1 can no longer recall but expect I would have been requested to assist at the

   audit by the Audit Scheduling Team.         Based on the size of the branch it

   would have required two auditors present.


48. On 26 July 2001 I attended an audit at Brookfield Post Office with my Line

   Manager, Ina Crawford. Ms Crawford was leading a special audit which had

   been requested by Suzanne Winter.        Ms Winter accompanied us into the

   branch, with her colleague Leslie Thorpe, where she explained the purpose of

   our visit. (List of Witness Statements p262 to 293 (AMCL0000031)).     I do not

   recall having any involvement prior to attending the audit.


49. I assisted with the audit under the direction of Ms Crawford. There was a

   standard process which we would follow. Ms Crawford would have taken the

   lead, but we would both of worked on counting the cash, stock and vouchers

   as required. I also note that the pension dockets were counted as part of the

   audit.   There would have been a process of counting the cash, stock and

   vouchers and recording this on a sheet which would then have been collated

   by Ms Crawford on her laptop to provide the overall balance.


50. On completion of the Audit Ms Crawford provided Ms Winter with the results.

   The audit examined cash, stock and vouchers and highlighted an error within

   the paid pension dockets with an overstatement of £381.60 (Group 13 -

   £92.15, Group 7 - £206.60 and Group 11 - £82.85) (List of Witness

   Statements p262 to 293 AMCL0000031).
                                                                                  W ITN08480100
                                                                                W ITN 08480100




51. On completion of the audit and once the findings had been reported Ms

   Crawford and I left the branch.    Ms Winter and Ms Thorpe remained at the

   branch to interview Mr McLaughlin.       I did not have any involvement in the

   investigation outside of the audit but was later asked to provide a statement to

   the Investigation Team in regard to the findings of the audit.


52. The Inquiry has asked me if I was aware of any allegations made by Mr

   McLaughlin in relation to the reliability of the Horizon IT system.    I do not

   recall being made aware of any allegations.       As the Assistant Auditor my

   involvement was limited, and I would expect any allegations would have been

  shared with the Lead Auditor or the Investigators.


53. As noted above, I was asked by the Investigation team to provide a

  statement. I am aware the case progressed to Court and note that document

  AMCL0000034 lists the charges against Mr McLaughlin on 26 April 2004. 1

   attended court as a witness but whilst wating in the witness room was told I

  would not be needed as Mr McLaughlin had pleaded guilty.          I left the court

   and was not aware of any further details regarding Mr McLaughlin's

   prosecution or his sentencing.


54. The Inquiry has asked me what my reflections are on the way the

   investigation and prosecution of this case was conducted by the Post Office.

   The Inquiry has provided me with the Judgment of the Court of Appeal at

  AMCL0000037.        My knowledge of Mr McLaughlin's prosecution is limited to

   my knowledge of the audit and therefore I cannot give a view on the way the

   investigation and prosecution was conducted.        My understanding was the
                                                                                  W ITNO8480100
                                                                                W ITN 08480100




   audit identified discrepancies which were reported by my Line Manager, Ms

   Crawford to the Investigation Team.     I understood that this formed the basis

   of the case against Mr McLaughlin but have a limited knowledge of the

   subsequent investigation and prosecution which I have set out above.




55. I have been asked by the Inquiry to what extent (if any) I considered a

   challenge to the integrity of Horizon in one case to be relevant to other

   ongoing or future cases.     If a Subpostmaster raised an issue I would include

   this in the audit report which would be provided to the relevant parties.       I

   would expect any issues would then be picked up and investigated as

   required.



56. The Inquiry has asked me if there are other matters I consider to be of

   relevance to Phase 4 of the Inquiry that I would like to draw to the attention of

   the Chair.    Having left POL over 7 years ago I have had no further

   involvement in POL and do not recall anything further that may be of

   assistance to the Inquiry.
