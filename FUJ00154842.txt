Anne,

I'm happy that they can be excluded if you are. My approach was always to leave events in if I didn’t understand
them, so if you're happy they are all benign, then they may as well be excluded.

Regards

Gareth

Penny,

We need to check counter 9, 27th Jan 2009, around 17:39. If anyone was logged on to that counter
then, I'll need to look at the messagestore.

Gerald, if Gareth agrees, I don't think we need any of the events from any of the EMV routines (e.g.
EMVValidate, EMVInputBanking, EMVLaunch).
