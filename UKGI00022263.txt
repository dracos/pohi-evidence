Subject: Meeting with the Minister

Gavin and I had a very good hour+ session with the Minister this afternoon. I’m hoping Sam will do a more detailed note
but there are quite a few actions:

- Briefing on the possible outcomes of the ruling on the first Horizon trial

- Verbal briefing on the second Horizon trial (needs to happen before 11 March)
- Shareholder involving between the Minister, Tim Parker and Al Cameron

- Some follow up on
