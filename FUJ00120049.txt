FUJITSU COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE

1. Introduction

1.1 Process Objective and Scope

The objective of this document is to define the process for Problem Management in the POA
environment. For the purpose of this document a Problem is defined as the unknown underlying root
cause of one or more Incidents.

The Problem Management Process covers both reactive and proactive functions of Problem
Management.

The scope of Reactive Problem Management is from identification of a Problem through to closure and
includes root cause analysis, identification of Known Errors, initiation of any necessary Change Requests
and the provision of management information to POA & POL. Problem Management is responsible for
ensuring that resources are prioritised to resolve Problems in the appropriate order based on business
need.

The scope of Proactive Problem Management includes trend analysis and investigation to identify
potential Problems, which are then progressed through the Problem Management process to be removed
from the estate.

For clarity it should be noted that individual Problems are owned by the Service Delivery Manager
responsible for the Service most affected by the Problem. In the event that multiple Services are
impacted, the Service Delivery Team Manager / Head of Service Management will appoint an SDM as
Problem Manager, who will remain in this role until the Problem has been resolved.

1.2 Process Rationale

The primary goal of the Problem Management process is to minimise adverse impact of Incidents and
Problems on the Post Office Estate, and to proactively prevent the re-occurrence of Incidents, Problems
and Errors. Problem Management focuses on finding the root cause of Incidents, creating Known Errors
and permanently removing Errors from the estate through the Change Management Process.

Although a Problem may be identified at any time, the management of Problems is essentially conducted
during office hours; i.e. 09:00 —- 17:30 Monday to Friday, excluding Bank Holidays.

1.3. Roles and Responsibilities

1.3.1 Process Owner

The owner of the process is the POA Service Delivery Manager responsible for the Service most affected
by the Problem. The Process Owner, otherwise known as the Problem Manager, is appointed by the
Service Delivery Team Manager. Process owner responsibilities include:

e Overseeing Problem Management Process

e Investigating potential resolutions

e Assessing if and when to resolve

e Defining target effectiveness metrics

e Ensuring Reports, Audits and Reviews are carried out regularly and effectively

1.3.2 Problem Resolver

The Problem Resolver is responsible for finding a resolution to the problem, and is assigned by the
Problem Manager.

1.3.3. Knowledge Manager

The Knowledge Manager is responsible for the information held in the Knowledge base and KEL, which
is updated by the HSD. The Knowledge Manager should be appointed by the Service Delivery Team
Manager.

1.3.4 Service Delivery Team Manager

The Service Delivery Team Manager is responsible for appointing a Problem Manager and Knowledge
Manager, ensuring Reports, Audits and Reviews are carried out regularly and effectively, and organising
and chairing Problem Review meetings. Meetings should be held as problems arise on an ad hoc basis,
but at least once a month.

e.g. during monthly reviews or on the telephone.

« Problem record raised by the Service Delivery Manager as the result of a direct request from an
SDU, apart from Service Desk, who have noticed a trend which needs investigation.

e Outputs from performance metrics where, for example, the SLT is at risk.

2.2 Process Outputs

Outputs from this process include:
e ~=Anentry in the KEL

3.1

Risks & Dependencies

Risks

The following define the risks to the successful delivery of the process:

3.2

Insufficient time and resource to build and maintain a Knowledgebase

Break in the communications chain to third parties. Mitigation is to invoke escalation procedures
Resistance by parties to carry out pro-active recommendations to reduce number of Incidents.
Mitigation is to investigate and address any issues, before escalating to senior management
Increased business and operational impact through lack of Problem progress updates to POL.
Unavailability of sufficient support unit staff

Unavailability of sufficient tools for problem diagnosis

Non-availability of KEL or call management systems

The provision of inadequate staff training

Unavailability of systems for evidence gathering

Loss of any infrastructure component which links support systems to the live estate

Dependencies

This process is dependent on:

Effective use of the process by IMT and SDUs

Effective routing of Problems to SDUs and third parties

Effective escalation procedures within Fujitsu, POL and third parties

POL acceptance of feedback, contributing to end user education and reduced Incident rates
Effective collaboration diagnosis between SDU's and third parties

4.1.1.1 A Problem Record is opened following a Major Incident, in relation to trend analysis, or as
the result of an Incident for which there is no existing problem record being received through
contact (see definition in Section 2.0 above) with the HSD from:

Users

Fujitsu SDUs

POA IT Service Management

Third Parties

Fujitsu Service Delivery Management

4.1.1.2 lf a Problem Record already exists, it should be updated and the new Incident should be
attached as a Child. If a KEL or workaround exists it should be implemented at this stage, but
the Problem Management process should still be followed to ensure that a resolution is found
if possible.

4.1.1.3 The Problem Manager should understand and define the scope of the problem.

4.1.1.4 The Problem Manager and Resolver should identify and record the problem and proceed to

step 1.2.1.

Matrix (see Appendix A)

5 The Problem Management allocates ownership of the problem to the Service team whose
area is most affected by the problem, and assign resources for dealing with the problem.

4.1.2.6 The Problem Manager assigns ownership of the Problem Record to a particular SDM within
the service team, and proceeds to step 4.1.3.1

There are eight possible outcomes to this.

4.2.3.4 The resolution is release-connected and can be included in the next major release.

next major release.

4.2.3.10 If the Problem Manager decides that a permanent solution is not justified, the Problem

original record and the problem can be reassessed for future resolution.

A Appendix: Priority Generation

Incident / Problem Priority generation

Accriticality value will be assigned by the account to each of their Classifications, as per the table below:

Criticality Value (1-5)
Critical 1
High 2
Medium 3
Minor 4
(Cosmetic — Incident only) / Change (Incident & Problem) 5

Based on the value selected by the Agent for the number of users affected, and the Criticality assigned to
the Classification they have chosen, an Impact value will be calculated using the table below. For
example, if the account has decided that the 'Security.Firewall.Install' Classification has a Criticality of 2,
and the number of users affected is 10% - 40%, an Impact value of 2 will be generated.

The agent will manually select an Urgency value from the drop down list, based on the following criteria:

1 e Has a significant adverse impact on the delivery of service to a large number of
end users.

e Causes significant financial loss and/or disruption.

e Results in any material loss or corruption of customer data.

For example, incidents with this urgency may affect the COMPANY

2 e Has a moderate adverse impact on the delivery of service to a large number of
end users

e Causes a financial loss and/or disruption to the customer which is more than
trivial but less severe than the significant financial loss described in the
definition of an Urgency level of 1.

. For example, incidents with this urgency may affect a VIP SITE
3 « Has a moderate adverse impact upon the delivery of service to a small or
moderate number of end users;

For example, incidents with this urgency may affect ALL COUNTERS IN A MULTIPLE
COUNTER BRANCH or a SINGLE COUNTER BRANCH

e Has a minor adverse impact upon the delivery of service to a small number of

end users
For example, incidents with this urgency may affect a SINGLE COUNTER IN A
MULTIPLE COUNTER BRANCH
5 e Has no impact upon the delivery of service
For example, incidents with this urgency may affect a SINGLE PERIPHERAL IN A
MULTIPLE COUNTER BRANCH

The Priority is then automatically calculated behind the scenes using a combination of Impact and
Urgency, as per the table below.

For example, if the agent decides that the Urgency value is 3, and the Impact has been calculated as 2,
then from the Priority table, the final Priority will be automatically generated as 2. The assigned priority
can be overridden if the problem is serious and discussed with the Service Delivery Team Leader, but the
Problem Management process must be followed.
