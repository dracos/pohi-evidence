FYI - there are some key issues here about our systems that could potentially impact relations with POL if mishandled - so
I am keeping close to it for a while!

This is an email that I received earlier from Gareth. You will see that he is clear that in order to answer Counsel's
question about any issues he needs to be able to check the underlying transaction logs to be able to say whether there
were any issues. On the specific issues you raise Gareth's view is:

            2.     He needs information and time to research the background to this case before providing any response;

            3.      He is not currently in a position to make a clear statement. It is possible for there to be problems where
            transactions have been "lost" in particular circumstances due to locking issues. When this happens then we have
            events in the underlying eventing logs to indicate that there was an issue. Whenever we provide transaction logs
            to POL we check for any such events. In the case of West Byfleet we have not been asked to provide any
            transaction logs and so have not made these checks.

            4.      Gareth has reviewed the statement by Eleanor Nixon. There is nothing technical there for him to
            comment on. If POL are able to expand on exactly what they did to resolve the issues and what they found to be
            the issues there, then he could comment on that. At first glance it is purely a case of incorrect use of the system
            and clearly with any system if incorrect information is input then incorrect results come out.

I hope that helps.

David / Penny,

Brief responses as follows, but not sure that I should put them in a Witness Statement:

2.    I need [Jones David M] information and time to research the background to this case
before providing any response

3.    This is where I'm reluctant to make a clear statement. I am aware of one problem
where transactions have been lost in particular circumstances due to locking
issues. When this happens we have events in the eventing logs to indicate that there was
an issue and whenever we provide transaction logs to POL we check for any such
events. In the case of West Byfleet we have not provided any transaction logs and so
have not made these checks.

4.    I have reviewed the statement by Eleanor Nixon. There is nothing technical there
for me to comment on. If POL are able to expand on exactly what they did to resolve the
issues and what they found to be the issues there, then I could comment on that. At
first glance it is purely a case of incorrect use of the system and clearly with any
system if incorrect information is input then incorrect results come out.

If you fee's it OK to pass this onto POL then that's fine by me, but I'm reluctant for it
to go further without POL's agreement and understanding of the potential implications.

Dear David and Penny,

On first glance points 2 - 4 have not been answered which I reproduce
below.

2)   My barrister telephoned me yesterday evening and requested that I find
out any information that Fujitsu may hold in relation to an office called
Callender Square in Falkirk. Apparently, Anne Chambers a Systems
Specialist employed by Fujitsu was cross examined and it is said that she
had full knowledge of an error in the Horizon system at this Post Office.
Our barrister would like Gareth to deal with this matter and expand upon
whatever issue Anne Chambers raised at court within his witness statement.

3) When Gareth completes his statement could he also mention whether there
are any known problems with the Horizon system that Fujitsu are aware of.
If none could this be clarified in the statement.

4) Could Gareth read the statement from Eleanor Nixon attached below and
respond in his statement to the points raised by Eleanor Nixon about
Horizon.

(See attached file: Eleanor Nixon Statement.rtf)

Could you please give this matter your urgent attention and look forward to
hearing from you.
