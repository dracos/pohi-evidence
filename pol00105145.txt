have actively engaged with members of the Private Financial Sectors and Police Scotland through Physical and
‘Vulnerable Adults at Financial risk forums.&#160; These meeting are designed to minimise risk to our business

through sharing best practice and information,

Thave prepared and submitted an article for the SBRC quarterly newsletter introducing Post Office Ltd to the

‘members explaining our evolvement as a Security team and promoting Grapevine.

‘There is massive potential to promote Grapevine and POL. within this group and intelligence sharing

opportunities are currently being considered with this group with the support of Dave Wood, Grapevine.

Thave regularly attended SBRC meetings and I am working on a project relating to Vulnerable Adults at
Financial Risk £160, The aim is to reduce crime against Vulnerable Adults from Bogus Workmen and Cold
Callers. The main gap being criminals can drive vulnerable people to various Post Offices to withdraw money

over several days.

‘My proposal is to makeStaff aware of vulnerable people through a &:ldquo;Know Your Customer&rdquo,

‘communication to all branches.

Post Office staff will need to be directed as to how we need to address them if they suspect customers are being
scammed. #160; Grapevine is the obvious outlet for the branches..&#160; In tum Grapevine needs to know who

they pass the information on to

Success at the end of the project will measured on quality and quantity. #160; To do this we need to know the

numbers of vulnerable people affected, reduce them and enhance their protection.

Solicitors Sendash; Scottish casework has been operating without appointed legal support for many years. I
hhave had to progress many cases without legal support unlike my UK colleagues South of the border. In 2013
Trealised that Scottish casework deserved the same legal support and I set about obtaining that support. In full
consultation with Jamail Singh I have recently secured the services of Brechin Tindall, Oatts to advise on all
casework within Scotland, &#160; This is of great support to me and to my colleagues who operate in Scotland in

support of me. [ nominated this company as they employ former Procurator Fiscals.

Since coming on board with POL I have organised and overseen Horizon Training for the Solicitors taking them.
through Post Office Ltd processes to ensure they understand our systems and that they are fully conversant with
‘current issues surrounding Horizon.&#160; This development would never have happened without my personal

input

have engaged extensively with the aforementioned Solicitors. This consultation has resulted in a considerably

authorities within Scotland. ‘This has never been mentioned by POL lead team level and it is something that I
have progressed extensively with the support of my direct Line Management. There is now a completely revised

are any agreed protocols conceming other Government bodies utilising POCA powers. This is an issue that has
never been progressed like the rest of the UK and { am determined to progress this as far as possible to ensure

POL Scotland have the same recovery procedures and support as in the rest of the UK.

‘This continues to be a work in progress and SBRC are making enquiries to assist POL. #160; I have discussed
‘with BTO Solicitors regarding running a Civil case alongside the criminal case to ensure POL are at the forefront
of Creditors. A draft is being worked on by BTO to be put to POL for consideration. &#160; f am taking all steps
