Please set out the process that your client undertook in identifying, reviewing and disclosing relevant
documents for Stage 3 Disclosure, pursuant to these categories of documents, in particular, confirm
why there appears to be such a limited number of documents disclosed in each stage during relevant
periods (as highlighted in the table above).

Third Party Reports

We note that your client has disclosed a number of audit reports produced by Ernst & Young, from
2011 (POL219214 / POL219218), 2012 (POL-0219403) and 2016 (POL218775), presumably
pursuant to paragraph 53(6) of the Generic Defence.

We note that the 2011 report in fact states “the main area [Ernst & Young] would encourage
management focus on in the current year is improving the IT governance and control environment’
and sets out the “risk [in relation to Horizon specifically] that users may inappropriately or accidentally
use the access leading to loss of application or data integrity’. The 2016 report prioritises
“reconciliation of Horizon and IPSL” to help to deal with fraud, relating to which it is stated there is a
“strong possibility’ of reoccurrence.

We would be grateful if you could now disclose the annual reports, produced by Ernst & Young or
otherwise, for each year since the introduction of Horizon, so that the experts and the Court will be
able to consider how the system developed over time.

Whilst reviewing document POL0171022, we note at page 38 that there is a reference to a KPMG
report addressing the “strategic architectural review of the risks and resilience of [Post Office’s] key
IT Services (including but not exclusive to Horizon)” that was to be made available in late June 2012.
Please disclose a copy of this report, which is likely to be relevant to these proceedings, and falls
within the categories of disclosure orders made against the Defendant. Please also disclose any
further audit reports conducted by KPMG (or other professional body) that relate to the architecture
and integrity of the Horizon system.

We note that document POL-0096436 (Business Data Model Guidance) refers to a Detica Report
dated February 2006, which highlights “the need for an approach to meta-data management and
data mystery’. In the event that this document is relevant to the Horizon Issues, please provide
disclosure of the same, or confirm why it is deemed to be not relevant.

Document POL-0219403 (KPMG report) refers at page 53 to a report by Qinetiq of January 2011.
Please disclose a copy of that report.

Document POL-0171022 refers on page 143 (to reports by Cisco and EMC, the findings of which
had been shared with Post Office. Please provide disclosure of those reports. We would also record
the fact that of the 222 pages comprising POL-0171022, 218 pages have been redacted, leaving
only 4 pages readable. You have previously refused our request to reconsider your approach to
substantial redactions across broad parts of the Defendant's disclosure.

Further disclosure

We note from document POL-0171024 that the counter capability experienced five “major incidents”
in the previous 12 months. Please provide disclosure of documents related to these incidents.

Document POL-0217341 refers on page 2 to “800 issues” being investigated. Please provide
disclosure of documents relating to the nature and extent of those issues.

Fujitsu Advice

We note that document POL-0216236 records that Fujitsu advised Post Office for several years to
upgrade POLSAP, which was declined by Post Office as a result of budgetary considerations. Please
provide a copy of this underlying advice from Fujitsu.

Document versions

Please find the enclosed schedule of documents disclosed by the Defendant which fall within the
various categories of disclosure orders made. Each of these documents has a version number
associated with it. It appears that in most cases, there are a number of versions of these documents,
and not all have been disclosed.

Please now provide disclosure of all outstanding versions of the documents listed in the enclosed
schedule.
