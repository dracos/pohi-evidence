Dear Zubeir
Re Branch Discrepancies — Bowness Road

I am aware that you have communicated previously with our Current
Agents team in relation to 2 unexplained discrepancies that have
impacted your branch. Thanks for alerting us to the issues.

I can confirm that gains totalling £3,186.70 declared at both TP9 in
2011/12 and 2012/13 were not proper to your branch. This problem was
created by a specific set of circumstances dating back to actual losses
cleared by the former subpostmaster in 2010 (TP8).

In brief the stock unit that cleared the relevant discrepancy was deleted on
or before 10" December 2010. The related Local Suspense entry should
also have been removed, but this did not happen.

The impact of this was that the loss clearance of 2010 was picked up
again at the beginning of TP9 the next year in Horizon and treated as a
gain. At the end of TP9 the branch was forced to clear this along with
current discrepancies. The Local Suspense ledger in the Post Office
Finance System was impacted in the same way.

This scenario was then repeated at the same point the next year.
Both TP9 discrepancies recorded at your branch were settled centrally at

your branch at the time. Post Office Ltd has settled the gains through pay
and will not be looking to recover these gains.

Changes to Horizon in 2011 prevented this problem for stock units
deleted after mid-December 2010, and the old Local Suspense entry has
now been removed from the system.

I do apologise for this problem being allowed to occur and impacting
your branch.

Yours sincerely
