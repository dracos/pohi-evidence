2 What hypotheses could support the Defendant’s claim
that the Horizon system was the source of the accounting
discrepancies?

2.1 Background

2.1.1 Accounting systems are usually designed around a ‘double entry’ booking
keeping principle. The double entry book keeping principle means that for
every entry into the system there is an equal and opposite entry that should

maintain the ‘halance’ hetween the accounts.

2.1.2 So, for example, if somebody at the till sells a stamp for £1 paid in cash then
the stock account would be reduced by £1 value of stock and the cash on
hand account would be increased by £1 — overall the balance between the
accounts would be unchanged.

2.1.3 As part of the process of financial control, it would be normal for the value of
stamps to be physically counted and recorded (stock value) and the value of
cash on hand physically counted and recorded (cash value) and these two

values compared (‘reconciled’) to what is recorded in the accounting system.
2.2 Hypothetical issues with the Horizon system

2.2.1 The User Interface gives rise to incorrect data entry: poor user experience
design and inadequately user experience testing can give rise to poor data
entry quality. In cases that users are working under pressure, insufficiently
trained or are using a system presented in a language different from their first
language the problems of data entry can be exacerbated. .

Yard House, Basingstoke, RG21 7NX

2.2.2 The Horizon system fails to properly process transactions: accounting
systems are usually carefully designed to ensure that accounts balance after
each “double entry” transaction. In particular, a database technology referred
to as ‘two-phase’ commit is used to ensure that either both entries or neither
entry is recorded on the system.

3 What evidence needs to be provided in order to
determine the merits of the Defendant’s claim? = -

3.1 The User Interface gives rise to incorrect data entry

3.1.1 In order to identify whether this is a possible cause, it would be necessary in
the first instance to sit alongside a user operating in normal Post Office
conditions that had only recently completed the standard systems training’and
who represented the kind of user engaged by the Defendant.

3.1.2 If there is a pattem of incorrect data entry then it would be necessary to
conduct a detailed examination of the kinds of incorrect data entry that occur
and the implications for failure of accounting.

, 3.2 The ‘Horizon system fails to properly process transactions

3.2.1 _ In order to identify whether this is a possible cause, it would be necessary in
the first instance examine the operations in normal Post Office conditions
where there is an experience by the branch manager of what they believe to
be incorrect transaction processing,

3.2.2 Further, if there is prima facie evidence of incorrect transaction processing, it
would be necessary to review the technical documentation of the Horizon
system and interview key individuals responsible for the system within the
Fujitsu team in order to understand the potential source of the incorrect
transaction processing.

3.2.3 Ifthe potential source of the incorrect transaction processing can be identified
then it would be helpful to be able to reproduce the problems under controlled
test conditions in a consistent and reproducible manner. This would require
the assistance of Fujitsu in providing access to the test environments
maintained in support of the Horizon system.
