Dear Tim,

Attached is a letter from Baroness Neville-Rolfe which was received late on Friday evening. As expected, and as we
believe has previously been flagged to you, the Minister requests you to review personally the issues relating to the Post
Office ‘Horizon’ system and determine whether any further action should be taken.

We are currently considering the best way to provide you with an introduction to the issue, such that you would then be
able to focus most effectively on those areas which you believe are of greatest concern. I have a meeting with you on
25 September and would like to use some of that time to outline our suggestions for a series of briefings, and to seek
your input on those proposals. in the meantime if you have any concerns or questions, please do not hesitate to contact
either me on the details below, or Mark Davies, Communications and Corporate Affairs Director Post Office Ltd
i being the Post Office executives responsible for ‘Project Sparrow’ as it is known internally.

Otherwise, I look forward to meeting you on 25".
Kind regards,
Jane
