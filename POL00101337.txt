We have also spoken to the Editors of RS and R4, plus the journalist who's filing the copy for BBC
online. All are fully aware of our position and have agreed to ensure future reporting will be “a fair
reflection" of the Report.

we're awaiting any further transcripts or coverage. We'll let you know if there are any further
developments.

Hi
please specifically challenge suggestion that we ‘acknowledge’ there were faults with Horizon - this is
straightforwardly inaccurate as below:

POL-0100920

POL00101337

"It wasn't dishonesty by people like Noel, so the Post Office, at least in this independent report that
they commissioned, acknowledging here that these, around 100, 150 sub-postmasters who are now pursuing
claims against the Post office may not have been at fault. "

Hi Mark
The transcript reveals BBC are claiming:
1. "the thrust of this report is that it was faults in that computer system"

2. 3s wasn't dishonesty by people (like Noel)". which could suggest that the criminal convictions are
unsafe.

3. “there were issues with the computer system (and the way it talked to over devices in the PO, the bank
machine, the lottery machine, it was the interaction of those bits of technology".
