1. ‘Introduction

This report is produced by the POCL Service Management team and provides a high :
level “in-flight” assessment of any threats to overall business continuity in the Congo 4
live service environment. The primary purpose is to identify any issues (actual or
potential) that might threaten the Congo 4 roll-out or regression from ICL Pathway
services. It should be noted that this report may have an operational bias.

For ease of reference, the report utilises a traffic light system with the following keys -

Immediate Threat to Business Continuity

Potential Threat to Business Continuity

The next full Horizon Service Report is scheduled for 29 May 1998.

No Threat to Business Continuity

4. End to End Business Continuity

Overall there are no major threats to business continuity, however the ‘lost transaction’
trend continues which is the key reason for the ‘BPS and Transaction Processing’
domains being on ‘amber’ status. The associated problems have now been promoted to

priority 1 level, to increase their importance and highlight to ICL Pathway, the concems ~

within POCL.

NB: This section of the report should be viewed and interpreted from the ‘end user” perspective and how
it will impact their environment.

5.1 Infrastructure

Post Office Relocations /Refurbishments

Identified improvements have been placed in the service description document and"
will be presented by ICL for comment by POCL Service Management on 15 May. A
walkthrough of the processes will be arranged with invitations extending to RLMs to
facilitate full understanding.

Printer Firmware
Printers being retuned from repair had not been configured with the correct firmware

settings. Resetting was necessary with SPMRs being advised by the Horizon System
Help Desk.

5.2 Benefit Payment System
Lost Transactions
+ ICL state that the system is satisfactorily operating within the contract constraints.
However confidence needs to be established by seeing a reduction in the actual number

of lost transactions. ICL have been requested to provide further detail i.e. memory store
log, audit trail and keypress log. Any conformance issues will be cascaded to outlets.

Frozen Half Screen

* Some post offices were affected. This was caused by memory leakage. A fix is oa %. :

forecast to be in place by April 1998

5.3 Transaction Processing & ICL Pathway Interface
Lost Transactions
Lost Transactions are perceived to be exhibiting a worsening trend and remain a serious
concern for Transaction Processing. Despite an increase in the overall transaction levels
lost transactions are showing an increase.

5.4 Fraud & Security
Authentication of Users to Helpdesks - One Shot Passwords
Discussions between Pathway and Fraud and Security (F&S) have brought
agreement on a procedure close. F&S have requested a Change Proposal to cover this
process and activity is in hand within Pathway to produce this CP.

5.5 Accounting & Reconciliation
Appendix ‘A’ details an agreed summary of accounting & reconciliation for the
March period.

6. BES: Volumetrics
Definitions for the purpose of this report.
A transaction is a broad description of a customer session. (the term ‘transaction’ is
more rigorously defined in the contract).
A payment is the Child Benefit allowance money due for one week, or for four weeks
(in the case of a four- weekly allowance).
An encashment is a measure of the work effort in a customer session from the clerk
accepting the payment card to returning the card with monies, i.e. one customer is paid
all due Child Benefit allowance. Thus, a customer may save several payments before
visiting their PO. During such a transaction there will be one encashment of several
payments.

Though the number of lost, stolen and damaged cards has increased, it still remains at
a consistent 0.33% of the cards issued.

6.2 BES Encashments against Forecast since Release 1c

BES: Actual Encashments Against Forecast

Volume

Actual encashments are now exceeding the original forecast due to a quicker than
estimated acceleration of the use of payment cards in all (bar three) of the 204 Ric Post
Offices performing card transactions.

Payment Card Calls by Customers to PCHL

It was anticipated from BA that payment calls (103 in number) were not and are not
proper to the PCHL. Calls of this type are better suited to a local Benefit Agency office.

There was an increase of 48% in the level of transactions during this reporting month
over the last period. Performance levels of reconciliation work therefore remain
good.

¢ Improvements

This period - ratio of incidents to transactions were 1:977 (last period 1:704).

¢ Concerns

Lost transactions hold steady with no signs of decremental improvement. This may
be a cause for future concern. This is being closely monitored by PSM.
