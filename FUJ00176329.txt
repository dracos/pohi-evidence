RE: Duplicates

L Denbali,

The reason behind the 2014 duplicates will be different to this case. Can you check what happened to the ARQ Andy

Hi Alan,

As discussed, please see attached emails. Looking at the reason for the duplicate records in
2014 from Gerald’s email, it seems this is a different reason to why we have duplicates this
time around is that correct?

Looks like we never highlighted the duplicates to them back in 2014 and I don’t recall they ever
queried it.

This time around I think probably best we do highlight although we do run the danger of opening
a ‘can of worms’ should POL decide they want to investigate further.

We will also complete the check Gerald suggested back in 2014: you need to confirm that you have
not got duplicate transactions which are not identical because that would be a new issue of
concern.

Can you think of anything else we need to cover off?

Gerald is on leave at the moment.
There a couple of approaches we could take to work around this and get the ARQ completed, but I think that it is
better that we wait until Gerald comes back on Monday and check what we did last time so we can adopt a consistent

approach.

This problem is going to occur again for any ARQs that overlap the date range 23"? ~ 25" Oct 2015. It would be a good
idea to add this, and the eventual workaround, to your list of ‘problem cases’ for reference the next time it crops up.

Farzin - Your problem with duplicates in an ARQ is another occurrence of the problem detailed below.
Andy — Can you remember if/how this was worked around last time?

Alan,
This was the issue.

Gerald subsequently told me “It turned out that the share on which they sat was migrated that day and the audit
configuration file was modified by hand with two separate paths to the same migrated share which caused the files to
be copied twice. It was incorrect procedure to modify the audit configuration files by hand.”

Hi Andy,

Yes it is something to be concerned about. Please raise a PEAK. I am copying all the transaction files to the
local disk of an audit workstation right now.

I have already got on a USB stick two files which contain the first set of duplicates so that can be examined by
FUJ00176329
FUJ00176329

anyone who wishes right now.

I have studied the first message, 5026965, in detail and it looks like the complete and same transaction is in
both files.

Gerald Barnes
