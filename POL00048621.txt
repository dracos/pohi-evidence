REGINA v HUGHIE NOEL THOMAS
GAERWEN POST OFFICE
PROCEEDS OF CRIME

Michael Matthews the Financial Investigator has asked me to write to you about
Mr Thomas’ pension.

He may now be aware that Mr Thomas was made the subject of a Restraint
Order on the 7" November 2006 in connection with the proceedings under the
Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. By virtue of the Restraint Order he was prohibited
from disposing of his assets including cash. He would however have been
entitled to draw a reasonable sum in living expenses on due notice to the
Post Office. Although notice was not given it is agreed that his pension should
continue to be paid.
