Dear Alice,

It was good to see you yesterday and thank you for sharing your helpful thoughts on a range of issues. I will
definitely follow up with a ( decent!) cup of coffee in the late summer as you hand on the baton. You have an
unusually comprehensive perspective on much that is relevant to ShEx and I would like very much to hear your
thoughts in more detail.

In the meantime pasted below is the link to the NYU professor I mentioned - it's a whistle stop tour of the major
U.S. Tech companies and quite an interesting view not least on its proposed acquisition by Amazon of the U.S.
postal service!

With best regards

Robert
