     Purpose

     The purpose of this paper is to:

     1.1   Request approval for the Information Technology and Change (IT&C)
           Transformation Programme which will increase IT&C's capability to support Post
           Office business transformation during 2.012-15, whi lst restructuring the Post Office
           IT supplier base.

     1.2   Seek authorisation to spend £1 3.38m of OPEX to deliver the programme, which wi ll
           be incurred from FY11/12 through to FY15/16 (summary financials provided at
           Appendix 1).



     2.1   IT&C has a pivotal role in supporting Post Office business transformation. A
           significant increase in capability and capacity is necessary to provide the volumes of
           skills and resources to deliver the business programmes and IT enablers to drive the
           business change. At the same time Post Office is faced with the imminent expiry
           and re-procurement of the majority of its IT supplier contracts, e.g. Fujitsu in 2015
           for Horizon counters.

           In addition, as part of the Post Office Strategic plan, IT&C has committed to a
           considerable cost challenge. Whilst business transformation activities will add to the
           IT&C cost base, the FY2015-16 target is to maintain the FY2012-13 cost base
           (approximately £120m). This is a significant chal lenge given the level of business
           transformation planned_ More details can be found in Appendix 1.

           The programme has defined a strategic approach for IT&C to address these
           challenges covering the IT supply chain" and IT&C operating model=. The proposed
           models adopt industry standards and good practice whilst remaining pragmatic to
           best meeting Post Office needs. They are recognised across the IT industry and,
           along with the alternate options considered, have been validated by Gartner.



     3.1   The strategic approach and business case have been reviewed and agreed by the
           Programme Board, all individual members of the ET, and by Finance.

     3.2   ET and POLIC have approved the programme and associated investment.

     t.. '.r   •s

    4.1        The programme has two major activities which will be undertaken over the next
               three financial years.

    4.2        IT supply chain re-configuration

               The programme wil l move Post Office from over 60 individual IT supplier contracts
               to an industry standard that has prime suppliers providing services through a
               simplified tower' 4 model. IT services wi ll be structured into four primary 'towers' of
               Service Desk, Workplace, Networks and Applications/Data Centre/Infrastructure
               (see Appendix 2 for details). All prime suppliers will be managed by a Service
               Integrators operating across the tower structure.

               In addition, the programme is establishing several IT Frameworks6 (see Appendix 2
               for detai ls) to allow the efficient sourcing of ad-hoc specialist IT services for Post
               Office. This approach offers speed to market for new products and services,
               provides the opportunity to transform Post Office services, and ensures value for
               money.

               Procurement and service transition will be phased to minimise impact on business
               transformation activities (as detailed in Appendix 3):

                     The Service Desk tower will be bundled with the Service Integrator and
                     targeted for 01 2013 award. This will offer optimum appeal to potential
                     suppliers in terms of scope of the requirement and value, and will align IT
                     service del ivery with the first line support functions
                     Workplace, Network and Application s/Data Centre/Infrastructure towers will be
                     targeted for Q3 2013 award
                     Following award, phased transitions will occur to minimise exit costs and
                     impact on Post Office separation activities

    4.3        IT&C operating model implementation

               The programme has identified a number of areas where there is a requirement to
               uplift the capability of IT&C. In particular managing current Post Office IT service
               delivery has been identified as a critical area to the success of maintaining current
               services, supporting the transition to the new IT supply chain and one where the
               required capability upl ift is significant.

               To address this challenge, an external' Service Integrator will be procured to
               manage the performance and deliveries of Post Office IT suppliers. A number of
               IT&C colleagues wi ll be transferred to the Service Integrator which will avoid
               knowledge loss. Contract award is targeted for 01 2013.

 IT Tower -- a group of related -T services, delivered by a prime supplier
either directly or through sub-     contracting, e.g. Data centres
 Service Integrator - an organisation to whom the current Post Office IT
service delivery function will transfer to manage the IT Supply Chain,
standardise services and implement cost-effective business operations.
 IT Framework - a group of pre-contracted suppliers through which IT services
and products can be competed and procured, without requiring a full OJEU
exercise.
External Service Integrator - the approach to achieving the requ-red Service
Integrator capability through an outsourced model has been independently
challenged by Berkeley Partnership (Post Office SPMO consultants) and
determined to be strategically appropriate to the proposed IT Supply Chain
model and timing within the context of the wider Post Office transformation
agenda.

                                                                                                 POL00103334



                                Post Office Ltd — Strictly Confidential


              The Service Integrator will support the creation of a post-transformation IT&C
              organisation that is business focused, responsive and flexible. It will enhance the
              quality of services provided by IT&C to its customers, provide a catalyst for the IT
              supply chain to transform how services are delivered (e.g. new technologies,
              standardisation, off-shoring), and deliver increased value for money.

              Robust terms of engagement will be established to make certain Post Office
              achieves optimal utility while minimising costs with the Service Integrator. IT&C will
              realign its structure, grades and capability to ensure that we have adequate
              assurance and governance in place for the management of the Service Integrator.

              Investment will be made to up-skill the retained IT&C organisation 8, change ways of
              working and leverage the Service Integrator to augment IT&C project resources
              where appropriate. This approach will deliver a step change in the maturity and
              skills of IT&C.

5       Costs

        5.1   The costs for implementation of the programme are £13.38m (as detailed in
              Appendix 1).

        5.2   The programme has established a baseline IT&C cost base through detailed
              evaluation of the current year spend and projected transformation impact. This
              baseline has been reviewed and agreed with Finance and aligns with the exit level
              used as part of the strategic plan submission to Government in 2010.

        5.3   The programme's business case expected scenario targets a return to an IT&C cost
              base of £120m by FY2016/17, following an intervening increase due to the Post
              Office transformation agenda.

        5.4   Following Post Office Board approval , the expected scenario will be baselined as
              the operating plan IT&C cost target.

6       Benefits

        6.1   The IT supply chain and operating model reconfiguration will:

                •   Deliver an expected financial benefit of £57.1 m (cumulative until 2016/17) and
                    a sustainable IT operating run rate reduction of £1 5.5m (11.5%). These will be
                    derived through: competitive re-procurement, service transformation, Service
                    Integrator efficiencies, economies of scale, and a fit for purpose operating
                    model
                •   Strategically (versus tactically) re-procure key contracts
                •   Implement fit for purpose commercial models
                •   Provide financial transparency and variable costing
                •   Introduce industry standard solutions
                •   Provide a catalyst for IT supply chain service delivery transformation
                •   Provide leverage over the current suppliers
                •   Provide the opportunity to introduce innovative solutions
                •   Enable IT&C to deliver and support the Post Office strategic plan
                •   Enhance IT&C capability (e.g. improved demand management)

    Retained Organisation - IT&O will retain the core teams for Programme and
    Project Delivery/Assurance, Architecture, Resource Management and Vendor
    management. These teams will undergo significant up-skilling through
    training, recruitment, and collaboration with the Services integrator.

                              Optimised baseline - the baseline IT&C cost base has been optimised to reflect an assumed level of tactical
                              contract negotiation and minor transformation with incumbent IT suppliers (the true 'do nothing' scenario)
                        •     Expected scenario - this is the target IT&C cost base and level of savings for the programme
                        •     Potential scenario - this represents a stretch target for the programme given appropriate execution and risk

BACKGROUND AND CONTENT:
IT&C provides the skills and resources to deliver business programmes and IT enablers
required to drive business change. Post Office is embarking on a significant
transformation agenda over the next three years which will substantially increase the
demands placed on IT&C_ At the same time we are faced with the imminent expiry and re-
procurement of many of our key IT supplier contracts. Furthermore, as part of the Post
Office Strategic Plan, IT&C has committed to maintaining its FY12/13 cost base whilst
supporting the business transformation.

In response to these challenges, IT&C has defined a strategic approach to re-positioning
its IT supply chain and Operating Model. Post Office Board approval is requested to
progress with the implementation of this approach and to the supporting business case.

     Purpose
     1.1 The purpose of this paper is to update the POL Board on the Network
          Transformation Programme. Specifically, it will provide:
         • An update on our implementation approach.
         • An update on our approach to prioritisation.
         • An update on Programme budget through 2012/2013.
         • An update on pilot activity, including lessons learnt and a summary of results
             obtained from customer and operator research.

2.   Approach to Implementation
     2.1 Implementation plans for the Network Transformation Programme have been
         developed and can be categorised into six key stages. This process will enable
         the implementation of 6000 activities by the end of March 2015.

     2.2 High level engagement with all Agents - A communications campaign, in place
         since October and designed to provide Agents with information on the
         Programme, operating models and the choices available to them. The campaign
         has included Network Live events and an Agent survey, responses to which have
         been encouraging.

     2.3 Preparation for rollout — enabling the programme to achieve a state of
         readiness to engage with Agents in April . Preparation includes recruiting and
         training new staff and finalisation of necessary terms and conditions,
         documentation and contracts, working closely with the NFSP.

     2.4 Validation — Over 3000 Agents have expressed an interest in change, via the
         estate survey. From early April, face to face conversations will take place with
         these Agents regarding the options available and possible impact of change.
         Following this initial meeting, POL will validate propositions and establish the
         Agents interest in the option and/or operating model that POL is recommending.

     2.5 Prioritisation of individual branch activity - All branches will be prioritised
         using a number of criteria and then released to the field team, as projects, to
         progress through to implementation. The financial impact to POL will be taken
         into account (see section 3) as will the overall Agent proposition and customer
         impact.

     2.6 Detailed engagement with volunteer Agents - Agents converting to a new
         operating model will complete and submit a business plan for approval and
         individual contract terms and conditions will be provided. For potential leavers',
         advertisement and recruitment for new operators will commence, in line with
         normal business processes.

     2.7 Implementation of branch changes will commence once conditional contracts
         are signed. Consultation activity will be required for relocations — POL is in
         discussions with Consumer Focus regarding the new Code of Practice which will
         determine the approach to consultation and communication activity. An MOU
         between POL and Consumer Focus will govern working practices through the life
         of the programme.

Approach to Prioritisation
3.1 Our approach to prioritisation needs to ensure alignment with the strategic plan;
    to deliver 6000 activities (4000 Mains and 2000 Locals over the funding period).
    One fifth of activities will be delivered in the first year of the programme (800
    Mains and 400 Locals), with two fifths delivered in years two and three (1600
    Mains and 800 Locals in each year).

3.2 Financial prioritisation has been undertaken to assess the net benefit/cost of
    conversion at branch level for the current, known volunteer on-site population.
    Net benefit has been calculated as the change in the agent's total pay.

   •   Circa 2,000 Agents have expressed an interest in on site conversion, via the
       estate survey_ These branches have been used in this financial assessment.
   •   An IRR based on net benefit, expressed as a percentage of the investment
       level is used to establish a financial prioritisation.
   •   For Main branches the saving in fixed payments is offset by the estimated
       increase in variable pay of 27%.
   •   For Local branches, the same method has been used but without increases in
       variable payments which are not appl icable to this population.

    Overall results are £21.3m investment, £11.1m annual net benefit at an IRR of
    52.36%. This is based on the circa 2,000 potential on site conversions, as
    detailed above. For Main branch conversions, we have agreed with the NFSP
    that for a period of up to three years, the remuneration received under the new
    contract will not fall below the levels that would have been received under their
    existing contract. As a result, realisable benefits for Mains wi ll be lower in the
    short term, excluding the positive impacts that conversion will have on customer
    numbers and potential new business.

3.3 Based on programme level financial analysis, the Network proposes to give
    priority to all on site Locals, followed by on site Mains, before consideration is
    given to off site Locals and off site Mains.

3.4 When financial analysis was extended to look at those branches that have
    expressed an interest in leaving the network, 47 branches were identified as
    providing a greater IRR than the minimum achieved (3.64%) within the on site
    population. Therefore, this subset will be prioritised ahead of the bottom on-site
    conversions for activity in 2012/2013. The results of this subset are £470k
    investment, £388k annual net benefit at an IRR of 82.58%.

3.5 In addition to the above, separate processes for the approval of compensation
    payments will be implemented in order to manage this spend to a necessary
    minimum.

3.6 As this is a voluntary programme and, in light of the other prioritisation criteria,
    highlighted below, network selections may vary. Financial assessments will be
    made on an ongoing basis to ensure that an overall understanding of the
    economic impacts of change remains understood.

3.7 As mentioned above, the financial impact to POL is only one criteria to be used in
    the selection and prioritisation of branches. Other factors will be taken into
    account in order to ensure implementation of 1200 activities next year. These
    include:

   •   Quality of the agent and future business proposition — including overall retail
       offer and willingness to extend opening hours
                                                                                              POL00103334
                                                                                            POL001 03334



                           Post Office Ltd — Strictly Confidential

             Exceptional circumstances — prioritisation of potential leavers' with ill health
             for example.
             Customer impact — branches that would del iver the greatest customer benefit.
             Geography - some regional prioritisation wi l l need to take place in order to
             smooth workloads and ensure change is being delivered with equal
             consideration in each of the devolved administrations.

     3.8 Branches that are currently perceived as being unsuitable for conversion or
         relocation at this stage will be de-prioritised. For example, branches with less
         than 400 customer sessions, those in high risk locations and those with low
         conformance ratings will be pushed back until corrective action/solutions have
         been found or actioned.

4.   Update on Programme Budget for 2012/2013
     4.1 The business case for 2012/2013 states full budget required of £144.5m — this wi ll
         be presented at March POLIC_ Spend wi ll enable the programme to deliver the
         targeted 1200 activities next year (with funding to achieve stretch at 1345). Key
         areas of spend include:

         • £21m staff and non staff costs.
         • £59m compensation payments to branches.
         • £33m investment payment to branches.

     42 Robust controls wi ll be in place to monitor programme spend throughout
        2012/2013 at an individual branch level through to a strategic programme level.

     4.3 A programme scorecard will be in place from the beginning of April . Key
         Performance Indicators include:

         •   Number of branch conversions, opening hours.
         •   Benefits tracking — contribution, fixed/variable pay ratios.
         •   Programme spend, compensation and investment levels.
         •   Customer and agent satisfaction, including waiting times.

     Update on Pilot activity
     5.1 176 pi lot branches are now live throughout the UK. Conducting pilot activity has
         allowed us to gauge the attractiveness of the models to Agents. 38% of the
         Agents engaged with have withdrawn from the pilot process for a number of
         reasons:

             Contractual reasons such as the requirement for Mains operators to register
             as a company, the need to obtain three quotes for fit out works and the need
             to open extended hours.
             Financial reasons such as lack of cash flow to invest in retail or compensation
             levels perceived as being too low.
             Personal reasons — timing not right for the agent.

     5.2 In some cases, we will implement mitigating actions to make conversion to the
         new models more attractive: Making voluntary, rather than mandatory, the
         requirement to adopt company to company status; reducing quotes for works
         from three to two; and providing £1 Ok investment to Mains branches upfront to
         enable linked investment on their retail side. If these mitigating actions had been
         applied to the pilot group, the withdrawal rate would have been reduced to 231®.

     5.3 Customer and operator research has also taken place across our pilot estate:
                                                                                          POL00103334
                                                                                        POL001 03334



                     Post Office Ltd — Strictly Confidential

        1216 customer surveys in Local pilot branches.
        Operator surveys in Local branches.
        Pre and post conversion research in recent Local and Main pilot branches.

5.4 Headline results from the surveys include the following:

    •   Average weighting time in Post Office Local branches stands at 41 seconds.
    •   96% customer satisfaction with the overall level of service in Local branches.
    •   98% customer satisfaction with the overall level of service in Main branches.
    •   63% of operators surveyed believed that the Post Office helped to increase
        their retai l sales. The average retai l sales uplift is 9%.
    •   67% believed the Post Office helped the sustainability of their branch.
    •   Some concern amongst operators regarding the level of support from NBSC
        this is being addressed through additional training.
    •   Some concern amongst operators regarding the level of training provided — a
        new training package has been developed which addresses these concerns.
    •   91 % of PO Local operators surveyed stated that they had received requests
        from customers for products to be added to the Local product set. A review of
        PO Local product set has been undertaken with some additional products now
        added. These include enveloped cheque deposits, BFPO transactions and gift
        cards. On demand Bureau de Change will also be included but only at on site
        conversions where the service would not otherwise be available in the
        community. MVL transactions will also be available at on site Local
        conversions but only by exception.
    •   81 % customer satisfaction in Locals with the range for products and services
        available.

1.   Purpose
     1.1 This paper updates the POL Board on the Crown Transformation Programme. Specifical ly, it
         will cover:
         • A re-cap on the background to the Crown Transformation Programme;
         • An update on the refreshed Crown strategy and the 3 year transformation plan;
         • An update on the new Premier Branch model trial at Birmingham.

2.   Background
     2.1 The Crown network is currently losing £64m and a condition of the funding agreement with
         Government requires Post Office to ensure Crowns breakeven by 2015.

     2.2   The strategy agreed with BiS [September 2010] to return the Crown network to a break-
           even position by Mar 2015 recommended that POL should maintain, in direct ownership, a
           small number of Premier (flagship) branches circa 90 and about 50 service hubs.

     2.3   The key enablers to deliver the original strategic approach were:
           • `Buy Down' of Crown staff pay by 24%;
           • Divesting c.180 large directly managed branches through franchising and re-siting a
              further 50 into 3rd party sites.

     2.4   Due to the radical and unpalatable nature of the 'buy down', the current economic climate
           and TUPE regulations, which taken together, impede POL's ability to franchise its biggest
           branches. A new strategy has been devised.

3.   Refreshed I New Strategy:
     3.1 The revised strategy, when fully deployed, should improve the Crown P&L by approx £61 m
          (see appendix 1) by the end of the planned period. This includes additional income of
          £19.2m, staff cost savings of £17.7m and real ising benefit of £4.2m through property
          initiatives. An additional £6.0m is achieved through some Crown divestment, with £13.7m
          del ivered from recurring benefits forecast in the 2011/12 P&L, and accounting policy
          changes.

     3.2   The strategy is based on applying a segmentation to the existing estate which results in the
           recommendation:
           • To retain 300 — 320 Directly Managed Crown branches, these wi ll typically be in excess
              of 3000 customer visits per week. About 30 branches will be flagships and anchor the
               network in high profile locations such as capital cities and prominent retail locations;
           • To divest 50-70 smaller / worst performing branches and where the impact on focus
               product income will be minimised. The Crown network will be reduced through a mixture
              of mergers (two branches into one where locations allow), maximising benefit through
               hosted models and through franchising to an agency main model.

     3.3   The segmentation was determined by assessing each branch against a number of weighted
           criteria:
           • Potential for staff savings through use of technology to improve the customer journey
                (mails products);
           • Size of branch based on weekly customer numbers;
           • Meeting customer and cl ient requirements for future Financial Services (FS) and Front
               Office of Government (FOoG) income projections;
           • Average P&L loss per customer session;
           • Staff cost to income ratio.
                                                                    1                  Final Version
                                                                                                     POLOO103334
                                                                                                   POL001 03334




     3.4   The plan shows an overall reduction of 1190 staff over the 3 years. This is comprised of:
           • 230 staff in 2012/13 as a result of the duties review, now agreed with the CWU;
           • A further 420 staff across years 2 and 3 as a result of the rollout of the new Crown model
              (based on mails automation only);
           • A review of the Crown Area Management (CAM) and Branch Manager (BM) structure
              will deliver a reduction of 40 managers;
           • The exit of c.50 branches will reduce staff numbers by a further 500 (based on an
              average of 10 staff per branch).

     3.5   The key enablers of the new Crown Transformation strategy are:
           • New income streams del ivered through a new branch design;
           • Increasing automation serving customers more effectively whi lst improving service;
           • Increasing staff engagement and focus on a personal face to face service;
           • A voluntary redundancy package to reduce headcount;
           • A culture and model that gives branch managers and their teams the ability to take more
              control of their branch (e.g. flexible working etc);
           • The abi lity to re-configure POL's Crown property portfolio to improve space utilisation,
              disposals and hosted models;
           • Collaboration with the CWU and Unite/CMA.

     3.6   Underpinning this strategy, there is a dependency on:
           • Implementation of the FS contract (Eagle);
           • Real ising the benefits of new FOoG contracts;
           • The opening up of Horizon to other peripherals and a suitable supplier of improved
              automated equipment;
           • Real ising the benefits through optimisation of property portfolio;
           • £124.4m of investment (see 5.5 below).

     3.7   The critical path of the Crown plan centres on the IT roadmap for the development and
           procurement of automation that will handle a larger proportion of the product set including
           mails products, bill payment and POCA. The current plan shows the proof of concept launch
           by autumn 2012 enabling ful l roll out from April 2013.

     3.8   We are working collaboratively with both CMA Unite and CWU to develop a plan that is built
           with maximum co-operation. Since December continued progress has been made:
           • Constructive consultation meetings have been held to agree the overal l plan;
           • Unite/CMA has agreed to the re-structure of the Crown Area Management team;
           • CWU have agreed to a full staff duties review that will identify the opportunity to remove
               230 staff from the network in 2012/13;
           • As part of current negotiations with the CWU on pay, POL is insisting upon key time
               workers and more flexible working practises as integral to any agreement.

4.   Branch Design / Pilot Sites
     4.1 The optimum Premier branch design will focus on improved customer experience through:
         • Bright, welcoming branches zoned to ease customer flow and maximise space

      hol istic approach to overall branch design and to deliver a customer centric, future proofed
      design for Premier branches.
4.3   Of the current product set, c.89% has potential for a self service solution. Deploying Post &
      Go enables 40% automation of the total volume. Further analysis is underway to identify the
      level of automation that will provide the optimum business benefit.

4.4   Birmingham was selected as the first pilot site due to its high mails volume and a history of
      below average queuing times.

4.5   The agreed objectives for this pilot were:
      • Redesigned branch layout to improve customer flow and focus on customer needs;
      • The introduction of additional Post and Go (P&G) kiosks to improve customer
         experience and reduce waiting times;
      • Greater emphasis on Customer Hosts to manage sales and service;
      • Improved staff capability and behaviours;
      • Improved sales and service following implementation of a new model.

4.6   Next Steps for Birmingham:
      • Complete the ful l duty review to identify and realise staff hour savings from additional
         Post & Go kiosks (March);
      • Agree transition timelines and identify key individuals who could become ambassadors
         for the Crown Transformation Programme (March);
      • Commence Phase two activities (Apr-Jun) to further develop the model including:
         ■ Full post implementation review and learning's from phase one;
         ■ Refresh signage, point of sale and product categorisation including preparation for
              pilot of FOoG initiatives
         ■ Introduction of flexible / key time working;
         ■ Opening hours extension to 6.30 p.m;
         ■ Addition of internal POCA ATM's;
         ■ Introduction of open plan travel desks creating an internal 'sales conversation' area.

4.7   Further Pilots
      Two additional Premier pi lots are being scoped at Chester and New Malden to further test
      the economic model and optimum branch design. Both branches have been shortlisted as
      typical 1 mid range branches to ensure findings are replicable across the wider network.

     4.8   Automation development.
           To accelerate our understanding of customer behaviour we are investigating the triall ing of
           card payment (only) Post and Go as they bring benefits of lower cost of acquisition and
           improved service levels (some cash P&G kiosks will be retained in trial branches).

5.   The 3 Year Plan
     5.1 In view of the critical path constraints of IT and automation development, year 1 of the plan
          (2012/13) contains initiatives that deliver P&L improvements and allow POL to further test
          new models before full rollout commences in 2013/14. Year 1 includes:
          • A staff duties review across the network impacting 230 staff;
          • The review of the CAM and sales support structure impacting 10 managers;
          • A review of the BM structure resulting in a reduction of 30 managers;
          • Develop the HR framework to prepare staff for the Premier model, developing the new
             training model, agreeing VR package with CWU / Unite CMA and staff exit programme;
          • Delivery of new income from UKBA work and improved FS sales;
          • Delivery of additional pilots: Currently shortlisted are Chester & New Malden;
          • To final ise the end to end branch design, ensuring alignment of the self service rollout;
          • Pi lot and roll out of Financial Services strategy enabling achievement of additional FS
             income:
          • Review of internal accounting principles that impact the network: FS joint venture
             renewals income and parliamentary branches.

     5.2   The full rollout of the Premier model to the remaining crown estate is planned to start in year
           2 (April 2013), with the objective of opening one new office per working day (excluding
           Christmas 2013) until completion in September 2014.

     5.3   The plan to divest 50-70 branches is anticipated to take place throughout years 2 and 3 but
           will be driven by opportunities to franchise and locate to hosted sites.

     5.4   A summary of the schedule of activities and initiatives that contribute to the P&L
           improvement is shown below:

6.   Top 3 Risks and Mitigation
     6.1 Union engagement. We are working collaboratively with CMA Unite and CWU to ensure
          understanding and buy in to the Crown transformation plan;
     6.2 II availability and speed of delivery. We are working with IT to understand and seek
          accelerated timescales;
     6.3 Certainty of future income growth. As roll out of the transformation strategy does not
          commence until April 2013, POL will have greater confidence in the certainty of future
          income growth before investment in branches begins.



     7.1   Note and approve the refreshed Crown strategy.

         The paper "First Impressions of the Financial Services Business" tabled at the
         September 2011 Board meeting (the Paper) highl ighted various issues facing the Post
         Office as it seeks to develop its financial services business; critical in this assessment
         was the conclusion that the extensive branch network, sales processes and brand do not
         "deliver an effective FS sales and service capabi lity".

         1.1.     This paper sets out the high level sales and related strategies to deliver a step
                  change to build and sustain a financial services capability. The value created wi ll
                  generate long term revenues to Post Office and assist del iver Crown
                  transformation. While some of the initiatives mentioned are already under-trial ,
                  others require planning, business case finalisation and assessment of
                  alternatives before proceeding. It is tabled for noting.



2.       The Paper highlighted a number of inter-linked issues in the current financial services
         sales model , in particular:

         2.1.     The Post Office is not associated with financial services, with customers normally
                  coming to a branch to conduct other product services. This is reflected in very
                  low scores for spontaneous awareness of the Post Office for general financial
                  products' at savings 25%, insurance 34%, credit card 6% and mortgages <1%.
                  Customers are not considering the Post Office on their 'list' of potential providers;

         2.2.     The current sales model using dedicated financial services representatives
                  (FSRs) in selected Crown branches and referrals elsewhere, is not del ivering
                  sustainable results, with low sales numbers and customers each holding less
                  than 1.1 product' is
                       ■     Of c360 FSRs 190 del iver fewer than seven sales per week (versus a
                             breakeven target of 11 5); in 2011/12 the average sale per FSR is 7.396;
                       •    Overall FSRs account for only 40 percent of sales, with 37 percent
                            generated from agencies and 22 percent direct;
                       •    The FSRs generally do not have the appropriate sales and product
                            skills, with most transferring from a branch counter and few (c50) holding
                            a relevant qualification (eg CeFA and CeMAP)7. FSRs receive 35 days
                            of induction training (25 is the classroom and ten in branch$); there is no
                            classroom training thereafter;

                       ■    FSRs are prohibited from offering advice. While this could allow a
                            simplified process with reduced compl iance risk, it actually provides
                            unclear boundaries as to what constitutes "advice" and significantly
                            reduces sales effectiveness;
                       •    The sales (and marketing) approach is largely `individual product push' -
                            pushing products at customers each time they enter the branch; this
                            risks raising a certain product in every customer conversation
                            irrespective of the likely need — this leads to wasted opportunities and a
                            negative customer reaction;
                       •    FSR remuneration is well below that of comparable bank sales staff,
                            reducing the ability to attract and retain the best talent. Incentive
                            payments do not encourage sales activity and the failure to meet targets
                            has not traditionally resulted in performance management action 10;
                       •    Branch (BM) and Crown Area managers to, and through, whom FSRs
                            report are generally not qualified to provide the necessary support,
                            oversight and compliance. Further BMs often use the FSR as part of the
                            general branch compliment and delegate general tasks (for example
                            general queue hosting 11 or supporting the Post & Go appliance);
                       •    FSRs are targeted on a number of sales across the key products
                            irrespective of the size12 and the local market dynamics;
                       •    The layout and lack of a `professional' feel in branches does not provide
                            an environment conducive to discussing personal financial matters.
          2.3.   At present FSRs are only located at Crown branches, significantly reducing the
                 scale and scope of sales opportunities in agencies.

          2.4.   While the un-promoted "propensity to try" is low, the latent opportunity is
                 confirmed though Post Office's own surveys of prompted consideration; this is
                 reflected in the 2011 YouGov Brandindex survey that ranked the Post Office as
                 the number one "destination for savings" institution in the UK13 based on
                 prompted responses. Furthermore those that do purchase are strong advocates,
                 reflected in high product Net Promoter Scores (NPS)14



3.        To underpin the delivery of financial services in the Post Office, the business has
          establ ished a long term vision:

                     "To be a recognised financial services brand and a serious alternative
                     to the major UK institutions (the "un-bank");
                     That a majority of the UK population is aware that the Post Office has
                     a wide range of financial service products and would genuinely
                     consider Post Office on their `shopping list';
                     To generate an increasing profit, supporting ongoing investment in
                     long term capability and market positioning".

     3.1.    The Financial Services Sales & Business Development strategy will deliver a
             step change in capabi lities and focus by fundamentally changing many of the
             structures and processes undertaken to deliver fi nancial services in Post Offices.

     3.2.    The specific initiatives set out in section four (below) draw extensively on the
             financial services sales models of successful postal operators15 as well as best
             practise banking sales management. These are based on:

                   ®    Clear and strong financial services branding;
                   •    Separate sales management structures within the branch network;
                   •    Dedicated, knowledgeable and focused sales and service staff;
                   ■    Active sales and performance management;
                   ■    Strong referral relationships and hand-off processes from the counter;
                   ■    Professional sales environment.
     3.3.    This change program wi ll be largely funded from the £4.0 million annual
             investment committed by the Post Office to build financial services capabil ity and
             agreed as part of Eagle.



4.   The Plan comprises a number of initiatives to build a sustainable and growing capability,
     covering the chal lenges raised in paragraph 2, in particular regarding branches, people,
     processes, skills and brand. It should be read in conjunction with the Eagle program
     (which inter alia will generate significant additional income to Post Office and a
     concomitant commitment to invest £4.0 million per annum), Project Polo (aiming to
     launch a current account) and Network Transformation (NTP).

     Staffing, Capability and Skills
     4.1.    To build the long term sales capability a program will be initiated to assess the
             capability and performance of all current FSRs; this wi ll likely result in a
             exit/redeployment of a significant number and their replacement with experienced
             financial services sale and service representatives.

     4.2.    An opportunity has been identified to transfer c60 poor performers to support
             NTP, reinvesting the savings (c£1.5 million) into recruiting experienced sales staff
             and building the capabi lity of the remaining staff.

     4.3.    It is anticipated that most future recruits will be sourced externally from banks etc
             with their profile should reflect the customers that they will target. A critical
             component of their induction training will be to spend an extended time with
             counter colleagues to understand the customer and process challenges as wel l
             as a significant induction training program (see 4.6).

     4.4.    FSRs should be located in both Agency as wel l as Crown branches, based on
             the market opportunity and the physical capacity of the branch.

     4.5.    At present under 15 percent of FSRs have a fi nancial services qualification. In
             the future every FSR will either be qual ified or will be in the process of gaining
             qualification — it will be a requirement of the role.

     4.6.    To support this, discussions have commenced with specialist financial colleges
             and training institutes to develop a "Post Office Finance Academy" to provide


       In particular Kiwi Bank (New Zealand Post), Post Finance (Swiss Post) and la Banque Postale (la Poste).

                                                                                                         POL001 03334




             entry, intermediate and advanced level training to all staff involved in financial
             services, enhancing their skills, knowledge and marketability. It is hoped that
             through this focus on skills development financial services in general, and being
             an FSR in particular, will be seen as an aspirational role in the Post Office.

     4.7.    Once an FSR gains an external qualification their reward and bonus potential
             would increase to rates comparable with the external market.

     4.8.    Under Eagle, the Bank of Ireland has committed to fund 40-50 sales
             effectiveness managers (BEMs)_ These will report to the Bank and provide
             ongoing training and support on financial services productst 6.

     Branch structure
     4.9.    To support and focus the FSR and create a financial services team focused,
             dedicated and measured on building the financial services business it is
             proposed that FSR reporting structure wi ll be realigned with FSRs reporting
             through to a dedicated area/regional structure17 to a Head of FS Salesl 0. This
             reflects best practise structures and enables the development of a base of skilled
             expertise and knowledge. Financial services training and sales management
             activities will also report into the Head of FS Sales;

     4.10.   The FSRs wil l continue to source sales through proactive approaches and
             referrals from counter staff requiring the FSR to maintain close relationships with
             counter colleagues19.

     4.11.   Removing the reporting line and training and development responsibil ities from
             the BM will release significant BM time, increase the effectiveness of the support
             and enhance overall risk and compliance.

     4.12.   To ensure that the maximum number of branches (agency and Crown) have a
             financial services capability, relevant surrounding branches should operate in a
             "hub and spoke" structure"', referring leads to the FSR21.

     4.13.   To enable inter-branch referrals and support the area manager assessment of
             the FSR pipeline, an effective sales management tool will be critical. Under the
             Customer Management Strategy the Post Office is trialling specialist software -
             Salesforce; this will enable inter- and home branch referrals and diary setting and
             the monitoring of pipeline and sales plans by area managers. The second phase
             of the trial should allow a single-view of the customer to be available to FSRs
             eventually including propensity modelling and next "likely product" prompting.
             Following the trial, this tool wi ll be rolled out to all FSRs22.

     4.14.   The branch environment will be enhanced through the NTP, creating Premier
             branches (with a strong focus on financial services) and Mains branches where
             face-to-face financial services sales will be provided via a resident FSR, a hub
             and spoke relationship or referrals to specialist contact centres.




16    A similar model (although on a smaller scale) operates very successfully with First Rate (FRES).
17
      Eg for sales management, pipeline overview and performance management; assumed ratio of 1:15.
18    To be filled by an experienced financial services sales executive likely through an external search.
19
      A referral fee would be payable to the `providing' branch with future sales linked to the branch.
20
      Iiu some cases the FSR may be based in different branches through a week; this will be known in advance
      to allow the branch and FSR to pre-arrange client meetings.
21
      The hub and spoke model is standard practice in retail banking.
22    Initial results from trial area confirm a 120 percent increase in sales.

                                                                                                            POL001 03334




     Sales Process and Targets
     4.15.   FSRs are unable to provide advice; it is difficult, however, to ensure compliance
             and very easy for the FSR to inadvertently cross the line while talking with a
             prospective client. Post Office is launching a trial to assess the benefit and
             compliance processes of providing "assisted sale" support; this does not result in
             advice being given, but will enable the FSR to have a wider discussion on the
             client's needs and the benefits of the products offered. This approach is
             consistent with that followed by UK retail banks.

     4.16.   Sales targets are set centrally and then cascaded down, with FSRs and branches
             being targeted with a mix of products. These targets are set with no assessment
             made against local market dynamics and opportunity potential. Targets should be
             nuanced to reflect local opportunities, ensuring that their aggregation delivers the
             overall target.

     4.17.   Historically the Post Office has had a weak direct marketing and email-marketing
             capability resulting in a very poor cross-sell rate. Direct cross-selling, based on
             segmentation, propensity modelling, cohort analysis and bundled offering is a
             cornerstone of successful retail banking customer growth strategies. The recently
             established Customer Manager Strategy is building a program to establish such a
             capability. The initial stages will be to:

                  •    Build integrity and completeness in the database;
                  •    Understand customer segments, profiles and behaviours;
                  ®    Develop contact strategy (direct and on-line) to ensure that appropriate
                       customers receive timely and relevant messages (and not too often);
                  ■    Implement propensity models to support face-to-face sales.
     4.18.   At present product processes are inconsistentZ3, complex and time consuming.
             To enhance the customer experience a process re-engineering review wi ll
             assess the end-to-end processes of all financial services products to establish a
             simple and consistent process. A review of mortgages has commenced.

     4.19.   At present the Post Office web-site does not effectively support the product
             proposition. In conjunction with the new on-line team, it is important that the on-
             line presence reinforces the branch capability, providing customers an
             understanding of product and service benefits as well as an alternative channel.

Brand and PR
     4.20.   To ensure that prospective customers are aware of the products and services
             available at a Post Office and to re-enforce Post Office as a credible provider, it is
             anticipated that Post Office will launch a financial sub-brand 24. This will be
             displayed on all relevant advertising/marketing as well as strongly in
             Premier/Main branches, providing a clear message and "call to action" that the
             Post Office is an active and relevant player in financial services.

     4.21.   The financial services brand will also be supported by an active PR program
             promoting financial services and confirming Post Office executives as "thought
             leaders". This program will commence once Eagle has been concluded and
             bedded-down and will support the wider Post Office Communications strategy.

21    For example there arc at least four different Anti Money Laundering product limits.
      To establish the Post Office as a credible financial services provider there is a need to re-position the
      overall Post Office brand. Therefore it is anticipated that the launch of financial services branding will
      follow the re-launch of the Post. Office brand in Q3 and will coincide with the roll out of a current
      account (subject to the conclusion of the trial).
                                                                                                                    POL00103334
                                                                                                                  POL001 03334




          4.22.   To support establishing the Post Office as a financial services destination it is
                  proposed to develop a branded banking index presenting the Post Office as the
                  thought leader in a particular market25 (for example on UK savings)_

          New Product Opportunities
          4.23.   As the FSRs are trained and become qualified and remunerated on delivery,
                  there will be an opportunity to expand the available product set, including inter
                  alia investment-linked ISAs, simple investment products, critical illness cover and
                  stakeholder or other pensions.

          4.24.   This would also allow Post Office to capitalise on the changes being implemented
                  from January 2013 under the Retail Distribution Review (RDR)26. The changes'
                  are expected to lead to a significant decline in the advice sought from 'mass
                  market' customers and a concomitant reduction in the number of financial
                  advisers in the market75.

          4.25.   It is anticipated that there will be significant growth in the demand for non-advised
                  solutions for the 'mass market', providing a major long term opportunity for a Post
                  Office model based on trained, qualified and capable FSRs.

          Program management
          4.26.   The delivery of this major long term program of change will require clear project
                  management. This will be establ ished by the team currently working on Eagle.



5.        The initiatives and long term change program set out above represent a fundamental
          step change in the capability, focus, behaviours and delivery of financial services,
          establ ishing the Post Office as a credible and competitive provider.

          5.1.    Critical to achieving this vision wi ll be the completion of Eagle, Network
                  Transformation and the establishment of a program management approach. The
                  benefits generated will support Crown transformation.

          5.2.    The paper is tabled for noting

           Many advisers are not expected to obtain the new qualifications, with those that do likely to target high
           net worth customers who are more likely to be willing to pay for advice.

1.   Paula Vennells asked for a formal referrals policy to be agreed with Junction ensuring no active encouragement of personal injury referrals unless requested by the
     customer. At present the following policy statement has been agreed between POFS and Junction:

     "Post Office Insurance will always seek to provide our customers with the most relevant advice and support whi lst making a claim and will not take any steps to
     encourage or incentivise fraudulent Personal Injury Claims.

     Further the Post Office Insurance will:
         1.    Not pass any Customer Data to Third Party organisation to proactively create Personal Injury Referrals.
         2.    Not Claims Farm closed claims with the potential for personal injury claims.
         3.    Never provide any additional incentives to customers to pursue a personal injury claim.
         4.    Never call a customer after notification of a claim without their express consent with the objective of making a personal injury claim referral.
         5.    Never contact third parties with the intention of encouraging a personal injury claim referral."

2.   Nick Kennett would also investigate the flow of fees to ensure that there is no inducement for wrong behaviours.

     The following are the details of the staff incentive program for the claims team - although a component of the incentive relies on an appropriate introduction for a PI
     referral this is part of a balanced score card approach. Inappropriate referrals would count against the agent's incentive.

     "When conducting a First Notification of Loss call, the cal l centre operative is incentivised around the understanding of the customer's needs. A balanced scorecard
     approach is used and if the contact centre operative does not meet the required standard, then they will not achieve their monthly bonus.

     The key metrics that sit within the balanced score card are as follows:

         •   Time taken to answer the call
         •   Number of cal ls abandoned
         •   Was the liability decision correct
         •   Did the customer require a replacement vehicle and was a hire referral made
         •   Was the customer injured and if they were, did they want representation and if so was an injury referral made

     The call centre operative is also measured on their soft ski lls and this is done by cal l listening( both live and recorded). The reviewing manager will focus on the
     following:

         •   Listening skills
         •   Empathy
         •   Building a rapport with the customer

     Our [Junction] FNOL providers wi ll monitor under and over performance and, if required, further training will be given to any advisors not meeting the required grade.
     In addition to this, ACM also listens to a sample of calls each month and the qual ity scores are reported into board on a monthly basis.

3.   Front Office of Government
     • The Pre Qualifying Questionnaire for the DVLA Front Office Services was submitted
        to the DVLA on the 9 March.
     • The DVLA has confirmed that all Post Offices offering the car tax transaction must
        accept cheque as a method of payment. This causes an issue where branches have
        been converted to the locals model, allowed to retain the car tax transaction but not
        accept cheque as a method of payment. If they are now required to take cheques,
        this compromises the associated cost savings. The issue has been escalated to the
        Network Transformation Programme Board and a compromise solution is being
        sought.
     • Our week of presentations and exhibition in reception at BIS is proceeding well.

C         r
     The Efficiencies Programme for 2012/13 is currently being planned. It is envisaged that
     a company-wide programme will be implemented which (1) takes account of efficiency
     targets already embedded in most supplier contracts, and (2) applies specific focus to
     evidencing value for money in our Network Transformation spend in line with National
     Audit Office "best practice". Indicative targets for business as usual' and major
     programme spend efficiencies will be reviewed by the ET in April before being submitted
     to the Board for ratification.

5.   Separation
     Work with the directorates on the definition of their desired target operating models for
     an independent Post Office is progressing. The phased cessation of services is on
     schedule with the first 66 services planned to cease by 31 March 2012. Final plans for
     the cessation of the remaining services across FY 2012/13 and 2013/14 wil l be available
     by 31 March 2012 as required by the MSA. Initial estimates of the costs associated with
     the programme continue to be revised downwards as detailed planning progresses.
     One-off costs have been re-estimated to be £22m to £27m (down from £30m to £40m).
     Recurring costs post-separation are likely to be in the range £102m to £109m (the FY
     2011/12 inter-business charge from RMG is £11 Om). The core roles for the programme
     team will be in place by mid-April 2012 and there continues to be a good working
     relationship between the teams from POL and RMG.

     Pay Negotiations
     Managers 2011 Pay Review: A further meeting took place on 28 February and Brian
     Scott stated he would accept our offer. The revised mandate has been approved by
     Group and a formal offer submitted to the CMA, which will now go out to ballot. The
     offer is as outlined previously and within budget - £2.2m (average 1.5% with some rates
     varying for certain grades/functions).
     In summary the main benefits are:
     • Engagement and delivery of Crown Transformation and Supply Chain strategy (hard
         wired to deliver tough changes within the programme)
     • £400k annual cost saving by removing overtime
     • Greater amount of pay deal is cash which aids reduction in fixed costs in Crown
          P&L.
     • Greater flexibility re management structures in Crowns.

2.   Pay Deals
     CWU 2012 — 2015: We are exploring an agreed partnership approach which wil l deliver
     a three year pay agreement and a new agreement on flexibility as follows:
     • Enabling seasonal to daily variation in staffing levels to more accurately meet
         customer demand. This also to enable extended opening hours at no extra cost.
     • Review of roles to ensure efficiency and sufficient skilled capacity to deliver growth in
         range of services. This could involve changing how old payments such as
         'substitution pay' (this is where colleagues step up to cover in the absence of a
         Manager) are paid in order to become more value-adding.
     • Improving our "host and sell" offer in branches. "Host and sell" is how we operate in
         branch and is being trialled in the Premier in Birmingham. (A "host" is similar to a
         meeter greeter and "sell" is looking at how we improve the selling of our products.)
     • Working to support more automation, some of which has been piloted in the
         Birmingham Premier trial .
     • Introduction of profit related pay.
     The mandate and options are currently being worked on to take into account the above.

     Quarter 4-. 11/12 Product Campaigns
     Telephony: The quarter 4 telephony campaign is proving extremely popular with
     customers and our branches: colleagues have been driving exceptional levels of sales.
     After 8 weeks of the campaign, we have processed in excess of 40,000 applications,
     with around 20,000 customers already live. With 5 weeks still to go, we will exceed the
     59,000 applications required to deliver the 44,000 live customers targeted.
     Insurance: The Post Office, in conjunction with POFS, has continued to roll out a
     number of pricing, incentive and marketing initiatives to ensure that the Policy in Force
     (PIF) numbers for general insurance remain above 300,000. As at 1 March, PlFs have
     risen from a low point of 335,000 in December 2011 to almost 358,000. Management is
     confident that growth can be maintained in the forthcoming period.

engaged with the RM team in developing the joint business plan for collections and
returns and ensuring that all of the remaining MDA requirements are delivered.
Separation: From a commercial perspective the Mai ls team is ensuring that the
relationship with RM commences in a positive way. Meetings have taken place to agree
the successful 'on boarding' of the MDA. The first customer forum was held on
21 February and both parties are committed to working in partnership to develop a
positive commercial relationship.
Mailwork negotiations have commenced with Royal Mail . Initial discussions have been
focused on understanding each party's position and common ground. We expect
negotiations to continue at pace through the next three weeks.
The Data working party has also met for the first time to understand how POL and RMG
will use data and MI in the future relationship. The joint working party will continue this
work over the next few weeks.

The purpose of this paper is to:

        1.1          Provide an update on safety performance.
        1.2          Outline risk reduction activities.

2.      Current Situation

        2.1          Total number of injury accidents, year to date, is better than target at 15.1%
                     down on last year and accidents involving absence are also better than target
                     at 40.6% down on last year. The per 1000 staff in post comparison indicator,
                     which takes account of head count fluctuation year on year, is showing a
                     similar decrease for absence accidents. Both Crowns and Supply Chain are
                     showing significant progress in embedding the safety management system
                     and thereby reducing accidents. The ratio of absence accidents to number of
                     heads remains significantly higher in Supply Chain than in Crowns, this is an
                     indicator of the different risk profiles associated with the activities and tasks
                     undertaken. The ratio of absence accidents to all accidents has improved from
                     1 in 4.5 to 1 in 6.5. This indicates that, in general, injuries from accidents are
                     becoming less severe, accepting that there were three exceptions that
                     resulted in long absences.

        2.2          The number of days lost due to accidents is now showing a decrease of 6.7%,
                     year to date, improving from a 2.7% increase last month. The previous
                     adverse spike in performance was due to 3 long term absences related to
                     accidents at work compared to one long term absence during the same year
                     to date period last year. Al l three have now returned to work fol lowing active

      2.3    Reporting of Injuries. Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations
             (RIDDOR) accidents are down 27.8% year to date from 36 to 26. Crowns and
             Supply Chain continue to perform favourably against the two bench mark
             metrics — the retail sector for crowns and a comparable CViT organisation for
             Supply Chain.

      2.4    The number of road traffic collisions (RTCs) year to date is currently showing
             an improving trend although having increased by 1.8% on last year from 214
             to 218 with the percentage of at fault' collisions showing a neutral trend over
             the past 3 periods although up from 38.8% to 52.7% on last year. (Table 3)
             While road traffic collisions account for less than 3% of the overall number of
             injury accidents they have the potential for high impact. The activities to
             improve performance are identified in 3.1 below.

Table 3 Road Traffic Collisions (cumulative)




      2.5    Robberies on Post Office Cash and Valuables in Transit (CViT) crews are
             down 52% on last year from 53 to 28, year to date. Physical injuries during
             robberies, of which there have been 14 year to date compared to 20 last year,
             remain relatively minor in severity. Fire arms have not played a significant part
             in the majority of robberies with 3 robberies, year to date, being enabled by
             the presence of fire arms compared to 18 last year. The activities that are
             considered to be having a positive impact on the robbery risk are listed at 3.2
             below.

          2.6       Robberies on the Post Office network are 14.6% down on last year, year to
                    date, from 116 to 99. Burglaries are up 9.6% on last year, for the same period
                    year to date, from 115 to 126. Physical injuries sustained during these
                    incidents have increased from 29 last year to 36 this year to date but remain
                    predominantly relatively minor in severity.

          2.7       The majority of accidents currently fall into three main categories: lifting and
                    handling, stepping and striking and outdoor falls, these are high frequency
                    events with, in the majority, relatively low impact. However the lower
                    frequency types of incident can carry the potential for very high impact, for
                    example, assaults and road traffic collisions.

3.        Activities

          3.1       Road Risk — Current activities to mitigate road risk are:
                •   Analysis of effectiveness of face to face training given to high risk drivers - top
                    50 -has indicated that accidents amongst this community have reduced
                    significantly
                •   Eye sight checks for operational drivers in place
                •   Technical accident reduction interventions on new vehicles e.g. Reversing
                    aids
                •   Analysis and evaluation of data (e.g. risk profiles) to determine further
                    accident reduction interventions
                •   Safety team input to vehicle specification
                •   Weekly case conferences to ensure consistent approach to accident
                    investigation, follow up activity and sharing of best practice

          3.2       CViT Robbery and Injury — The following factors and activities are considered
                    to be having a significant impact on mitigating the robbery risk:
                •   Active liaison activities with the police and increased police support activity
                •   Significant arrests - reducing the number of criminals involved in CViT crime
                •   Introduction of new deterrent technologies e.g. Smartwater — a solution that
                    contains a unique identifier that is released automatically in the event of a

                                                                                       3

               robbery, spraying those involved and enabling identification of the individuals
               involved in the robberies
               Reduction in opportunities for duress type robberies linked to the introduction
               of single person vehicles
               Rigorous training/refresher training programme
               Migration to services that Post Office is less exposed to e.g_ ATM robberies.



Driving activities have the potential for high impact/loss and remain a risk however the
actions identified above are aimed at mitigating that residual risk.



The POL Board is asked to:

       51      Note the overall improvement in safety performance
       5.2     Note the risk reduction activities.

BACKGROUND AND CONTENT:

Year to date operating profit of 78.4m was £41.5m favourable against the budget of
£36.9m, mainly due to,
  • Higher net income of £17.6m includes Mails £13.3m and FS £11.4m favourable, offset
    by Telephony £3-7m and Supply Chain £3-0m adverse,
  • Lower non staff costs of £18.6m includes write back of WHS Tupe claim provision
    £2.4m, computer costs £5.3m from negotiation and some timing with prior year.

Full year forecast is expected to outturn at £65m (£29m favourable to budget)


The YTD casliflow at Period 10 was an inflow of £54m which was £186m favourable to
budget, (Period 9: £89m favourable). This variance was mainly due to:
  • Net cl ient balances were £1 50m favourable and were predominantly driven by: the
    £39m benefit from the contract amendment with Santander for °Day C' settlement,
    £24m benefit from Bank of Ireland settlement amendment and network cash £57m
    favourable.
  • Profit £41m favourable.

Full year forecast is expected to be an outflow of £1 Om (£49m favourable to budget).

Headlines- as reported                         Royal Mail Group against Q2 Forecast
January 2012

Headlines
• External revenue of £70.6m was £1.9m favourable to forecast in the period.
• Operating loss of £2.6m in the period was £2.Om adverse to forecast, driven primarily by higher non people costs and lower JV income.



 Key Messages:
 • Cumulative Cashflow was £172m favourable to forecast and is expected to be closer, but still to outperform forecast at year end.
 • Period 10 profit was adverse to forecast by £2.0m due primarily to £0.8m higher than forecast non people costs and £1.4m adverse JV income.

 Profit Target
 Year to date operating profit was £78.4m against the forecast of £57.1m, giving a favourable variance of £21.3m.
 • Net Income was £879.5m which was £6.7m favourable to forecast.
 • YTD people costs were £2.1m favourable primarily due to continued unfilled vacancies.
 • YTD non people costs were £5.2m favourable of which the main variances are; £1.8m from reduced spend on IT contractors. Marketing and Legal fees. £1.6m from Staff &
 Agent related plus consumables and £0.9m is property and facilities related.
 • YTD share of Joint Venture profits were £0.1m adverse so broadly in line with forecast.
 • YTD IB expenditure was £3.3m Favourable.
 • Project costs remain under spent YTD by £4.0m, but the period was £0.8m overspent, showing signs of a ramp up.

 Year on year the profit is £46.6m favourable mainly due to higher net income of £37.3m (which includes the higher Network Subsidy Payment of £25.4m). £1.1m lower
 people costs, £4.6m lower non people costs (including IB), £6.8m higher share from Joint Ventures profits and £1.4m less spent on projects YTD.

 Cashflovcr.
 The YTD cashflow at Period 10 was an inflow of £54m against a forecast outflow of £118m, favourable by £172m (Period 9: £106m favourable).
 This variance was primarily due to:
 • Network Cash was £72m favourable, with cash holdings being £67m below forecast levels due to continuing focus on cash management, particularly ATM cash management.
 f=or information, branch cash for January 2012 was £432m (forecast £499m), January 2011 was £490m.
 • Client balances were £30m favourable due to timing as they have benefited from a higher than anticipated Santander creditor due to January's inflow of tax receipts.
 • A. contract amendment effective in P10 reducing the receipt of the ATM debtor by one day contributes £24m toward the overall variance, this was not forecast.
 • Other variances include; profit £21m favourable, working capital is £16m favourable due to higher trade payables and pay balances than forecast, and finally capital spend ',s
 behind forecast, a further £9m favourable.

 Focus _Pro rk_ les.LvsBsadgetl..
 YTD focus product sales are adverse by £1.3m driven mainly by Travel Insurance and Bureau where the budget assumed a flat market but tough trading conditions and
 competition are depressing volumes. There is also below budget performance on Telephony and in Life Insurance which had an ambitious growth target and, although there is
 small growth year on year, it is not at budgeted levels.

 Headcount

The Board is asked to note the resignation of Les Owen as Non Executive
Director effective 15 March 2012 and to authorise the Company Secretary to
file the necessary TM01 form with Companies House.

1.1   The purpose of this paper is to seek Board approval to the 2012-13 budget.




2.1   The Board was taken through the budget in detail at a review session on 8 March
      2012 and was given the opportunity to ask questions and chal lenge assumptions.
2.2   The budget meets the strategic plan operating profit of £84m (net deficit £126m).
2.3   The broad shape of the budget was supported following the review but there was a
      key area of challenge regarding the increase in the staff cost base between 2011-12
      and 2012-13.



3.1   The following action will be taken to address the concern regarding the increasing
      staff cost base:

      •   To revisit the Organisational Review principles to ensure that there has been no
          dilution of best practice;
      •   To use the Quarterly Performance Review (QPR) sessions booked for 26 and 27
          March to challenge the directors on the increasing staff cost base;
      •   To issue a top down challenge to all areas allocating the £5m non staff efficiency
          (already in the base budget) and a £5m staff efficiency (not in the base budget
          and creating contingency to be held centrally against income risks).



4.1   The POL Board is asked to

      •   Note the actions being taken in response to the chal lenges given on 8 March
          2012 and, on that basis:
      •   Approve the 2012-13 budget.




                                                                                 Chris Day

ANNEX A

1.    Strategic Plan Context

1.1   The three years of the Strategic Plan to 2014-15 have been reviewed and
      updated and the shape of the budget set out below delivers the foundation for
      hitting the 2014-15 exit rate as set out in the Strategic Plan. This is consistent
      with the strategic objective of reducing the Network Subsidy Payment to £50m
      pa in 2017-18.

1.2   There is currently a gap of £30m in the 2013-14 PBIT compared with the
      Strategic Plan but this gap is considered to be within an acceptable tolerance.

1.3   The cumulative cash flow is c£8m higher than the funding agreement which is
      considered a modest variance and well within the £200m headroom included
      as a contingency.

2.    Background

2.1   This is the second year of Strategic Plan but the first year with additional
      funding. It includes:
      •       An increase in Network Subsidy Payment of £30m to £210m;
      •       Additional funding of £200m.

2.2   The budget delivers the Strategic Plan profit of £84m (net deficit £126m).

2.3   This budget del ivers income ambition, while maintaining cost control and a
      significant level of strategic activity including:
      •       Roll out of the new network models;
      •       Pursuing Front Office of Government pi lots/operations;
      •       Delivering Eagle;
      •       Mails — developing SME opportunities and product simplification;
      •       Delivery of the new telephony supplier;
      •       People — building the 'can do attitude' and increasing strength for
              independence; and
      •       Financial Services prepaid card platform.
                            «




                                .n




3.1   The proposed budget Profit and Loss Account is set out in Table 1 below.

3.2   The key objective to del iver operating profit of £84rn as set out in the Strategic
      Plan has been met, however, there are some changes to the way it is
      delivered. The baseline plan includes:
      •      Challenge to the income line together with the anticipated impact of a
             Mails tariff increase and Eagle results in higher income of £37m;
      •      Changes to the approach to Crowns, Eagle, independence,
             strengthening and pay deals result in higher staff costs by £45m but
             these are partly offset by lower agents' costs by £8m;
      •      Challenge to mitigate non staff cost increases with efficiencies results
             in lower non staff costs by £7m and charges from Royal Mail have not
             increased as predicted resulting in lower costs by £14m;
      •      The improvements above release funds to invest more in project opex
             activity by £16m.
                                                                                        POL00103334
                                                                                      POL001 03334

3.3    The operating profit of £84m is £19m higher than the quarter 3 forecast for the
       2011-12 outturn driven by a £30m increase in Network Subsidy Payment. The
       net deficit of £126m is £11 m higher than the 2011-12 forecast. It should be
       noted that 2012-13 is a 53 week year which results in higher net income of
       £11 m and higher costs of a simi lar level.

3.4    The key changes from the 2011-12 forecast (excluding project one off costs)
       are:
       •     Net income has increased of £34m with particular growth in Personal
             Financial Services (Eagle) of £20m and increases in Mails income of
             £14m from RPI, tariff (net of volume decline) and 53rd week. The
             growth areas are partially offset by decl ine in traditional business
             including DWP exceptions (green giros), NS&I, payment services and
             DVLA.
       •     Operating costs (excluding project one off costs) have increased by
             £32m including staff costs £18m, agents' pay £6m, non staff costs
             £10m offset by savings in interbusiness costs with Royal Mail £2m.
       •     Staff costs are planned to increase by £18m including £6m for
             separation/strengthening, £6m for pay awards (Supply Chain already
             agreed and Managers/Admin not yet agreed), £6m for Eagle staffing,
             staffing of vacancies and other new services, £2m for pension rate
             changes and £3m for the 53rd week. These increases are partially
             offset by savings of £6m from the Crown Programme. This plan
             already includes a centrally overlaid savings task of £4m reflecting an
             expected restriction to strengthening requests and underlying level of
             vacancies remaining. In addition, and in response to the Board Review
             discussions on 8 March, it is planned to task the business with a further
             £5m efficiency saving to create a £5m contingency to be held centrally.
             The £4m already embedded in the budget and the £5m additional task
             represent a 3% efficiency against the requested budgets.
       •     Agents pay is planned to increase by £6m reflecting alignment to the
             sales plan and the anticipated new mails tariffs.
       •     Non staff costs are planned to increase by £10m mainly driven by
             £6m separation/strengthening costs, £.10m IT related costs and £4m
             Eagle commitment. There is a £15m efficiency task embedded in the
             non staff budget. £10m of this is owned by the Operations Directorate
             and delivery will be through various activities including increased
             challenge of suppliers. £5m is to be tasked to the business and
             supported through an Efficiency Programme. The £1 5m efficiency task
             represents 8% of the budget requested.

3.5    The costs of implementing projects (project one-off costs, POOC) have
       increased significantly from £23m forecast for 2011-12 to £38m for 2012-13.
       These are explained further in section 3.7 below.

3.6    The exceptional items include impairment of capex, redundancy, agents
       compensation and major transformational change costs. The anticipated
       grant income from Government funding is also included as exceptional. The
       increase reflects the significant extra strategic programme activity arising from
       the implementation of the strategic plan with the Network Transformation
       Programme forming the largest single activity with £141 m of this planned
       amount.

4.2                     The budget has been prepared in greater detail than the Strategic Plan which
                        has resulted in some changes across headings and a net improvement from
                        this position to a cash outflow of £85.3m. The redundancies, provisions and
                        exceptionals variance is driven by Network Transformation Programme cost
                        being less than anticipated in 2012-13 but this is expected to catch up in later
                        years.

4.3                     The redundancy, provisions and exceptionals cost is entirely driven by NTP
                        and the Crown Programme.

4.4          The capex plan includes NTP £45m, Technology (programmes £22m and
             required upgrade activity £13m) and Supply Chain vehicles £8m. There is
             also £18m included at this stage for a North West Cash Centre. Alternative
             options for the North West Cash Centre are being investigated.

   2.1 The Post Office Staff Superannuation Scheme (POSSS) was establ ished on
       1 October 1969 when The Post Office separated from the Civi l Service and
       was established as a statutory corporation. The scheme was replaced by
       the Post Office Pension Scheme (POPS) for new joiners from 1 April 1987.
       The two schemes merged to become the Royal Mail Pension Plan (RMPP)
       on 1 April 2000. The POSSS is now Sections A and B of RMPP and POPS
       is Section C. The membership of Sections A, B and C are as follows:
                •   Section A — applies to joiners up to 30 November 1971. Members
                    retain rights similar to the Civil Service Pension Scheme and were
                    unaffected by the Pension Reform changes in 2008.
                •   Section B — applies to joiners between 1 December 1971 and 31
                    March 1987.
                •   Section C — appl ies to joiners between 1 April 1987 and 31 March
                    2008.
   2.2 The key terms of the sections are set out in Appendix 1.




   3.1 The Postal Services Act, Parliamentary discussions and Civil Service
       discussions make the following statements in relation to the future of the
       existing RMPP scheme:
         •     That the RMPP will be ful ly funded as at the "cut-off date" (currently
               planned as 31 March 2012).
         •     That the RMPP will be left with residual assets to cover the cost of the pre-
               1 April 2008 final salary link at a rate of RPI+1 %.
         •     That a new section of RMPP (the "POL Section") is established to hold
               POL members of RMPP.
         •     That it is possible to transfer the POL Section into a mirror image
               independent pension scheme, with the consent of the RMPP Trustee at
               some point in the future.

   4.1 A breakdown of membership of POL section by job area and age for each of
       Section AIB and Section C is shown at Appendix 2.

RMPP employee contribution rate

   5.1 The RMPP employee contribution rate is 6% and has been at this level since
       1 December 1971.
   5.2 There have been anecdotal promises by historic Royal Mail Group senior
       executives to maintain (what is now) RMPP employee contributions at 6%.
       The first time this was explicitly communicated to the RMPP membership
       was in the member communications immediately prior to the merger of the
       Post Office Staff Superannuation Scheme (POSSS) and the Post Office
       Pension Scheme (POPS) to create the RMPP in 2000.
   5.3 The contractual status of this promise was questioned by Royal Mail Group
       when considering the Pension Reform of 2008. Legal advice obtained by
       Royal Mail Group states that, because of the member communication in
       2000, the RMPP 6% employee contribution would likely be viewed as a
       contractual promise by the Courts.
   5.4 This rate is therefore not irrevocably fixed into the future but has been
       deemed as a difficult change to make in the past.
   5.5 POL employees wi l l have their employment rights protected via the Transfer
       of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations, commonly known
       as TUPE. TUPE prohibits making any changes to the terms and conditions
       of employment if the sole or principal reason for the variation is the transfer.
       This adds a further layer of complexity to increasing the employee
       contribution rate.
   5.6   It should be noted that the RMG pension plans do not currently operate on a
         salary sacrifice basis. Operating on a salary sacrifice basis would allow POL
         and RMPP members to save on National Insurance Contributions. This
         saving could be used to help offset the cost of an increase in employee
         contributions.
   5.7 Based on information in the Towers Watson Pension Scheme Database and
       two general surveys (the NAPF Annual Survey carried out in 2011 and the
       2010 Occupational Pension Schemes Survey carried out by the Office for
       National Statistics - ONS - in 2010), the average contribution rate paid by
       members is around 5.0% to defined benefit schemes (i.e. final salary and
       career average).
   5.8   Restricting this to different sectors does suggest different average member
         contribution rates. For example, restricting the Towers Watson database to
         retai l clients suggests an average of more like 5.3% whereas those that
         could be viewed as former public sector organisations appear to have an
         average more like 5.8%.
   5.9 Towers Watson's database (which covers around 300 defined benefit
       schemes, almost exclusively private sector, of which 28 are career average)
       suggests an average career average rate of around 6.1% (this group
       includes the RMPP) and the ONS survey suggests 5.4%. This difference is
       likely to reflect the different coverage of the Towers Watson database and
       those who responded to the ONS survey.

6.1       Pension Reform was implemented in order to reduce the ongoing costs to
          the Group due to concerns over affordability. The employer ongoing rate
          was 20% prior to the reform and was expected to fall to cl 1 % but adverse
          investment market conditions and changes to actuarial assumptions meant
          that this level of reduction was never seen and the rate implemented after
          the 2009 actuarial valuation was 17.1 %.
6.2       Pension Reform made the following changes:
      •     the RMPP closed to new members from 31 March 2008;
      •     all pensions and benefits earned before 1 April 2008 are still linked to final
            salary at the time of leaving the RMPP;
      •     from 1 Apri l 2008, benefits accruing for RMPP members do so on a career
            salary basis;
      •     the normal retirement age increased from 60 to 65 for benefits accrued
            from 1 Apri l 2010, however benefits accrued prior to 1 April 2010 retain a
            normal retirement age of 60; and
      •     from 1 Apri l 2010 it is possible to draw benefits with a normal retirement
            age of 60, and continue working while still contributing to RMPP so as to
            accrue benefits with a normal retirement age of 65 until the maximum level
            of benefits has been achieved.
      •     A new defined contribution plan (Royal Mail Defined Contribution Plan)
            was launched in April 2009. New recruits joining from 31 March 2008 are
            able to begin paying contributions to the new plan after they have worked
            for the company for a year. This is administered by Zurich Assurance Ltd.
            Employees may pay 3%, 4% or 5% of pensionable pay and attract
            employer contributions of 5%, 6% or 7%, respectively.
6.3 The change introduced was not as severe as the original proposed change
    as this included severing the final salary link for pre-1 April 2008 service (this
    element of pension benefit would be revalued as if the employee had left
    service on 1 April 2008) and the closure of RMPP to new entrants as at 31
    January 2008.
6.4 The changes were successfully implemented following union and employee
    consultation.
6.5 There was a roll ing programme of industrial action by CWU members in
    2007 caused by changes to working patterns, pay rises and Pension
    Reform.
6.6       It should be noted that the change made by the Government to the method
          of increasing pensions via the move to CPI indexation from RPI indexation
          resulted in an actuarial gain £3.4bn in Royal Mail Group's 2010-11 accounts
          and no industrial action from the Trade Unions.
6.7       It may be of interest to know that the averages suggested by the surveys
          are:
      •     Accrual rates: around half of schemes accrue benefits on 60ths, as per
            RMPP Section C. The other half of schemes have a variety of accrual
            rates, with the public sector predominantly on 80ths accrual (as per RMPP
            Section A/B).
      •     Normal retirement age: The majority of private sector schemes now have
            a normal retirement age of 65 (around 75% of private sector schemes)
            with the others mainly having a normal retirement age of 60. In the public
                                                                                       POL00103334
                                                                                     POL001 03334

            sector, there is a roughly even spl it between 65 and 60, with a small
            minority (less than 10%) using a different age.
      •     Please note that the above features should not be taken as indicating that
            a typical scheme has the average contribution rates, normal retirement
            age and member contributions. Identifying such links can only really be
            done by a fuller benchmarking exercise.




7.1 The measures that the Postal Services Act puts in place are concerned with
    past service only, and do not bind participating employers in RMPP to any
    future course of action.
7.2 There are a number of stakeholders with whom POL should discuss further
    pension reform prior to the launch of a formal member consultation, such as
    the Shareholder Executive, Royal Mail Group, Royal Mail Pensions Trustees
    Limited, the Trade Unions and the Pensions Service Centre.
7.3 The POL Board could consider a number of options, all of which will affect
    the POL Section funding risk in a different way. Actuarial advice wil l be
    required to quantify the impact of these options. These options could
    include:
      •     Changing the employee contribution rate;
      •     Severing the final salary link to pre-1 April 2008 service;
      •     Changing the accrual structure;
      •     Changing the normal retirement age;
      •     Capping pensionable pay rises;
      •     Changing the revaluation rates to the statutory minima;
      •     Closure of the POL Section to future accrual
7.4       In order to make these sorts of changes to the POL Section the following will
          be required:
      •     a consultation with scheme members must take place over a period of at
            least 60 days, as per The Occupational and Personal Pension Schemes
            (Consultation by Employers and Miscellaneous Amendment) Regulations
            2006.
      •     RMPP Trustee consent will also be required if the change to the POL
            Section requires the POL Section Rules to be altered.
7.5 It is important to note that The Occupational and Personal Pension Schemes
    (Consultation by Employers and Miscellaneous Amendment) Regulations
    2006 require only that a consultation takes place. An agreement over
    pension changes does riot need to be reached.
7.6       Introducing salary sacrifice to the POL Section (assuming no change to the
          employee contribution and no other material changes to benefit accrual were
          made) would not trigger a 60 day consultation, but would need to be
          discussed with the stakeholders mentioned in 7.2. Also RMPP Trustee
          consent would be required to change the POL Section Rules to permit salary
          sacrifice.
7.7       Furthermore, it has been considered appropriate when considering RMPP
          scheme design issues in the past to ensure that any material changes
                                                                                            POL00103334

             applied to the RMPP are also applied in a consistent manner to the Royal
             Mail Senior Executives Pension Plan.

Immediate next steps

   8.1 The Trustee is obliged to carry out a triennial actuarial valuation of RMPP as
       at 31 March 2012. Although the POL Section will not have been created on
       this date, it is likely that the Trustee wil l seek to carry out an actuarial
       valuation of the POL Section over the course of the 2012-13 Financial Year
       as one must take place within one year of the creation of the POL Section.
   8.2 As the Trustee has not been informed of any changes to the RMPP scheme
       design, it will assume that there would be no material changes to the benefit
       structure and wi ll base its actuarial assumptions on this basis.
   8.3 It should be noted that the actuarial valuation process wi ll provide POL with
       a significant amount of data as to what the future cost of funding the POL
       Section wi ll be. Providing accurate funding data at present is very difficult
       due to the fundamental change in membership since the previous actuarial
       valuation in 2009 (caused by the Pension Solution) as well as the fact that
       POL has never undergone a covenant assessment as a separate entity to
       RMG.
   8.4 The Trustee's initial requirements of Post Office Limited will therefore be:
         •     Sign an interim Schedule of Contributions which detai l the employer and
               employee contribution rates, as well as the timing of payments to the
               Trustee, which will be in effect until the actuarial valuation
         •     Access to senior management and strategic plans in order to review the
               strength of covenant;
         •     A view from the company on its appetite for risk which will steer the
               proposed investment strategy and likely ongoing contribution rate.




   9.1 There are 5 POL employees who are members of RMSEPP.
   9.2       POL is able to be admitted as a participating employer in RMSEPP on the
             following terms:
         •     RMG agrees to POL participating in RMSEPP from 1 April 2012, or such
               later date that POL becomes the employer of RMSEPP members.
         •     POL will delegate RMG to carry out negotiations with the Trustees on
               funding, investment strategy, etc, on its behalf. RMG wil l liaise with POL
               to obtain its views on such issues (as is currently the case).
         •     POL will pay future service contributions in respect of its members at the
               rate applicable to the Plan membership as a whole (as is currently the
               case).
         •     POL agrees to pay 7% of any deficit payments to the Plan (as is currently
               the case) in respect of benefits accrued both before and after 1 April 2012.
         •     POL agrees to pay 7% of any other expenses incurred by RMG in relation
               to the operation of the Plan as a whole, such as actuarial advice to the
               Company during valuation negotiations with the Trustees. In 2012/13 this
               figure is estimated to be £650,000, meaning that POL would pay £45,500.
               A breakdown of these estimated expenses can be provided, if requested.

   •   POL agrees to pay the whole cost of any work carried out purely at its
       request or relating purely to it. For example, any analysis it asks to be
       carried out of its members, or work generated by it ceasing to be a
       participating employer.
   •   RMG will consider any request from POL for a POL employee to be
       appointed as one of the employer nominated trustees when a vacancy
       arises, if POL puts forward a candidate with the appropriate background
       and qualities, but any appointment would always be based on ensuring
       that the Board's overal l balance of skills and experience was maintained.
   •   RMG will prepare the documents required to bring about POL
       participation, and POL will assist in completion of such documents where
       necessary.




10.1 There are currently 809 POL employees who are active members of
     RMDCP. This represents 6% of the RMDCP population.
10.2 POL is able to be admitted as a participating employer in RMDCP on the
     following terms:
   •   RMG agrees to POL participating in RMDCP from 1 April 2012, or such
       later date that POL becomes the employer of RMDCP members.
   •   POL will delegate RMG to carry out negotiations with the Trustees on
       investment strategy, etc, on its behalf. RMG will liaise with POL to obtain
       its views on such issues.
       POL will reimburse RMG for its share of the Plan's running costs that are
       not met by deductions from the members' accounts. These costs shall be
       split between POL and RMG in proportion to each company's active Plan
       membership as at each 1 April, and will be payable quarterly in arrears.
       These costs include, for example, Trustees' advisers' fees, independent
       trustee fees, Plan Secretary costs, and levies. In 2012/13 this figure is
       estimated to be £470,000, meaning that POL would pay approximately
       £28,200. A breakdown of these estimated expenses can be provided, if
       requested.
   •   POL will reimburse RMG for its share of the Plan's life assurance
       premiums. This cost shall be based on POL's actual membership, as
       calculated by the insurer. A figure for life assurance premiums is already
       charged back to POL from RMG, and it is expected that there will be no
       material difference in cost.
   •   A new POL "employer reserve" wi ll be set up from its participation date, to
       receive the employer contributions released when non-vested POL leavers
       take a refund of their own contributions. The existing employer reserve will
       remain under the control of RMG.
   •   POL agrees to pay the whole cost of any work carried out purely at its
       request or relating purely to it. For example, any analysis it asks to be
       carried out of its members, or charges generated by the setting up of
       bespoke POL communications channels, or work generated by it ceasing
       to be a participating employer.
   •   RMG will consider any request from POL for a POL employee to be
       appointed as one of the employer nominated trustees when a vacancy
       arises, if POL puts forward a candidate with the appropriate background
       and qualities, but any appointment would always be based on ensuring

                that the Trustee Board's overall balance of skills and experience was
                maintained.
            •   RMG will prepare the documents required to bring about POL
                participation, and POL will assist in completion of such documents where
                necessary.


11.   POL participation in the Insured arrangements

         11.1 POL employees who do not contribute to a pension scheme are currently
              eligible for a life assurance benefit and an income protection benefit through
              an Insured III-health arrangement provided via RMG. The life assurance
              benefit is provided through an insurance policy held by a trust called the
              Royal Mail Group Life Assurance Scheme (RMGLAS).
         11.2 POL employees who contribute to RMDCP are currently eligible for an
              income protection benefit through an Insured III-health arrangement provided
              via RMG.
         11.3 POL employees who have their pensionable salary capped are currently
              eligible for a death in service benefit from outside their pension scheme to
              ensure that a 4x basic pay death in service lump sum is paid to their
              dependents. This is provided via RMG through an insurance policy held by
              a trust called the Royal Mail Supplementary Life Assurance Scheme
              (RMSLAS).
         11.4 POL is able to be admitted as a participating employer to the above insured
              arrangements on the following terms:
            •   RMG agrees to POL participating in RMGLAS, RMSLAS, and the Insured
                III-health arrangement from 1 Apri l 2012, or such later date that POL
                becomes the employer of members in those arrangements.
            •   POL will delegate RMG to carry out any negotiations with the Trustees or
                the Insurer on its behalf. RMG wi ll liaise with POL to obtain its views on
                any issues under negotiation.
            •   Currently, the running costs of these arrangements are minimal , and POL
                membership relative to that of RMG is small. While this continues to be the
                case RMG does not intend to ask POL to reimburse it for any of these
                costs. RMG does, however, reserve the right to amend this pol icy in the
                future.
            •   While the above "no reimbursement of costs" policy appl ies POL agrees
                that the RMGLAS "employer reserve' built up from insurance claim
                amounts not paid out to beneficiaries remains whol ly under the control of
                RMG.
            •   POL will reimburse RMG for its share of the premiums of these
                arrangements, based on POL's actual membership, as calculated by the
                insurer. A figure for premiums is already charged back to POL from RMG,
                and it is expected that there wil l be no material difference in cost.
            •   POL agrees to pay the whole cost of any project type work carried out
                purely at its request or relating purely to it. For example, charges
                generated by the setting up of bespoke POL benefit categories,
                communications channels, or work generated by it ceasing to be a
                participating employer.
            •   RMG will consider any request from POL for a POL employee to be
                appointed as one of the employer nominated trustees of RMGLAS or
                RMSLAS when a vacancy arises, if POL puts forward a candidate with the
                                                                                     POL00103334

          be based on ensuring that the Trustee Board's overall balance of skills

      •   RMG will prepare the documents required to bring about POL
          participation, and POL will assist in completion of such documents where
          necessary.




The POL Board is asked:
   12.1 To note the above.
   12.2 To delegate authority to Chris Day to sign the RMPP POL Section Schedule
        of Contributions.
   12.3 To delegate authority to Chris Day to extend Alwen Lyons' appointment as
        an Employer Director of Royal Mail Pensions Trustees Limited to 31 July
        2012.
   12.4 To confirm whether it has received enough information to articulate a view
        regarding POL's attitude to investment risk. If so, the POL Board is asked to
        delegate authority to Chris Day to negotiate investment strategy for the POL
        Section with Royal Mail Pensions Trustees Limited.
   12.5 To agree to POL participation in RMSEPP, RMDCP and the insured
        arrangements, and to delegate authority to Chris Day to sign the
        documentation that wi ll affect this.

(a)     The Chair reported that:

        Royal Mail Holdings plc (RMH), the Company's parent company, and certain of
        its group companies including the Company are undertaking a proposed
        reorganisation (the Transaction);

        it is proposed that, among other things, the Transaction include the transfer of the
        entire issued ordinary share capital of the Company from Royal Mail Group
        Limited (RMG) to RMH and the issue of one special rights redeemable
        preference share of £1 in the capital of the company (the Special Share) to one
        of Her Majesty's Secretaries of State; and

 iii.   the purpose of this meeting was to consider and, if thought fit, to approve certain
        actions in respect of the Transaction.

(b)     The Board acknowledged the Transaction and resolved that it is in the best
        interests of, and for the proper purpose of, the Company to undertake certain
        actions in respect of the Transaction, as far as they relate to the Company, and
        that the Transaction would promote the success of the Company.

(c)     A draft of a secondment termination agreement to be entered into by the
        Company and RMG (the Secondment Termination Agreement) was presented to
        the Board. It was explained that this document recorded the fact that the existing
        secondment arrangements were coming to an end and that the termination of
        this arrangement would be a TUPE event, so that all staff currently provided
        under this arrangement would transfer from RMG to the Company. The Board
        noted that the agreement also included express wording to allocate liabilities for
        the transferring staff between RMG and the Company. The Board approved the
        terms of the Secondment Termination Agreement and authorised any Director of
        the Company to execute the Secondment Termination Agreement on behalf of
        the Company in the form tabled or with such amendments as the person signing
        the agreement may, in such person's sole discretion, approve (such signature to
        constitute approval of any such amendment).

(d)     The Board noted that the Articles of Association of the Company would need to
        be amended to reflect the changes to the structure of the group pursuant to the
        Transaction, as well as to reflect the implementation of the Companies Act 2006
        and the Postal Services Act 2011, among other things. The Board also noted that
        it was proposed that the Company remove its objects clause together with all
        other provisions of its Memorandum of Association in accordance with the
        Companies Act 2006. A draft of the proposed new Articles of Association of the
        Company (the New Articles) was presented to the meeting, together with a note
        explaining the principal changes. The Board acknowledged that the adoption of
        the New Articles by the Company and the deletion of the provisions of its
        Memorandum of Association would require a special resolution to be passed by
        its sole member.
                                                                                                POLOO103334
                                                                                              POLOO103334




                          Post Office Ltd — Strictly Confidential


(e)    The Board noted that it was proposed that, in accordance with the New Articles,
       one special rights redeemable preference share of £1 in the capital of the
       Company (the Special Share) be issued to the Secretary of State. A draft
       subscription letter to be signed by the Secretary of State in respect of the Special
       Share was presented to the Board. The Board acknowledged that the issue and
       allotment of the Special Share by the Company to the Secretary of State would
       require that the Company's sole member pass an ordinary resolution to give
       authority to allot the Special Share and a special resolution to disapply pre-
       emption rights.

(f)    The Board discussed the shareholder approvals required to effect the steps
       referred to above and it was resolved that written resolutions of the sole member
       of the Company to approve these steps be recommended. A draft of the
       proposed written resolutions of the Company (the Written Resolutions) was
       presented to the Board. The Board approved the Written Resolutions and
       instructed the Secretary to send the same to RMG (as the sole member of the
       Company) for execution and to send a copy to the Auditors.

(g)    The Board resolved that, subject to the Written Resolutions being passed, the
       terms of the Subscription Letter be approved and that, upon the receipt of a duly
       executed Subscription Letter from the Secretary of State:

       the Special Share be issued and allotted to the Secretary of State;

       the Secretary be instructed to register the Secretary of State as the holder of the
       Special Share in the Company's Register of Members and to prepare a share
       certificate in respect of the Special Share; and

iii.   any two Directors or any one Director and the Secretary be authorised to execute
       a share certificate in respect of the Special Share in the name of the Secretary of
       State.

(h)    A draft stock transfer form to effect the transfer of the 50,003 ordinary shares of
       £1 each in the capital of the Company (the Ordinary Shares) from RMG to RMH
       was presented to the Board. The Board resolved that, subject to the receipt of
       the duly executed and stamped stock transfer form and the presentation of such
       document for registration in accordance with the provisions of the Articles of
       Association of the Company:

       the transfer of the Ordinary Shares from RMG to RMH be approved;

       the Secretary be instructed to register the transfer of the Ordinary Shares in the
       Company's Register of Members and to prepare the necessary new share
       certificate, following cancellation of the existing share certificate; and

iii.   any two Directors or any one Director and the Secretary be authorised to execute
       the new share certificate in respect of the Ordinary Shares in the name of RMH.

 (i)   The Board resolved that Paula Vennells and Chris Day be and are hereby
       severally authorised on behalf of the Company to sign and/or despatch all
       documents and notices to be signed and/or despatched by it under or in

       connection with, and to take any additional actions as are necessary or incidental
       to carry into effect the Transaction, the purposes of the resolutions referred to
       above or the transactions contemplated thereby.
(j)    The Board resolved that al l actions taken by any Director, officer (including the
       Secretary) or agent of the Company in connection with the Transaction prior to
       the date of this meeting be authorised, approved, ratified and confirmed in all
       respects as acts of the Company.

(k)    The Chair instructed the Secretary to take the following steps, subject to receipt
       of the duly executed Written Resolutions:

       file the amended Articles of Association of the Company and a print of the
       Written Resolutions with the Registrar of Companies;

ii.    prepare, sign and deliver to the Registrar of Companies a statement of
       company's objects (Form CC04) and a return of allotment (Form SH01);

iii.   update the Register of Members of the Company to reflect the issue of the
       Special Share to the Secretary of State and the transfer of the Ordinary Shares
       to RMH; and

iv.    make all such other fil ings as are required in relation to the resolutions passed at
       this meeting.

The purpose of this paper is to explain the steps required and resolutions to be passed
relating to the forthcoming group restructure which will result in POL becoming a directly
owned subsidiary of Royal Mail Holdings Limited (RMH) and a sister company to Royal Mail
Group (RMG).


2.     Background

There are a number actions to be taken and documents to be signed in order to effect the
separation, which will require Board approval. In brief summary, these are:

2.1    The transfer of the entire issued share capital of POL from RMG to RMH and the
       issue of one "Special Share' to a Secretary of State (currently, in practice, BIS).

2.2    Signing of a secondment termination agreement to end the current secondment of
       RMG staff to POL and enable them to be permanently transferred (under TLJPE)..

2.3    A new set of Articles of Association, taking account not only of the change of
       ownership but also various changes arising from the Companies Act 2006 and the
       Postal Services Act 2011. The new Articles will also include the delegated authority
       levels, which have recently been agreed with BIS (attached as Appendix A).

2.4    Secretary of State to sign a subscription letter in respect of the Special Share.

2.5    A number of agreements, yet to be finalised, (e.g. Trade Marks & Domain Name,
       Swindon Agreement etc), for which the board will be asked to delegate authority to
       sign to Paula Vennells and Chris Day as and when they are in agreed form.

2.6    Various formalities to be carried out by the Company Secretary after all the relevant
       steps have been completed.

Items 2.3 and 2.4 wil l also require Shareholder resolutions, the wording of which the board
will be asked to approve.

Attached as Appendix B, is a set of draft Board minutes which serve to give a more detailed
explanation of the above requirements.


3.     Recommendations

The POL Board is asked to delegate to a sub committee of the board the right to pass the
resolutions substantially in the attached form together with any other documents required to
give effect to the transaction.

Purpose

The purpose of this paper is to seek the Board's approval to revise the delegated
authority to authenticate the fixing of the Company's seal.
          •




2.1       The company seal is affixed to documents executed as a Deed (most
          commonly property documents). According to the existing and proposed new
          Articles of Association, unless otherwise authorised by the Board, the seal
          must be authenticated by two Company directors or one director and the
          company secretary.

2.2       Previously, by authority of a board resolution, the POL seal has only required
          the authority of a single Director or the Company Secretary or another named
          individual. It is proposed that POL continue with this model going forward_




The Board is therefore asked to approve that the affixing of the company seal may be
authenticated by any current Director of the Company or the Company Secretary or
Assistant Company Secretary or the following signatory:

1.     Purpose

The purpose of this paper is to:

1.1    advise the Board of Al ice Perkins' proposed appointment as a director of RMH

1.2    seek the Board's agreement that this proposal is in the best interests of the business,
       notwithstanding any potential conflict of interest which may arise from such
       appointment.


               ♦

2.1    Under the forthcoming re-structure, the proposed RMH Board will comprise only the
       relative "Chairs" of the two sister companies — Royal Mai l Group and Post Office
       Limited.

2.2    For the purposes of section 175 of the Companies Act 2006 an appointment as a
       director of both the holding company and one of its subsidiaries, could be regarded
       as a situation which is reasonably likely to give rise to a conflict of interest and
       therefore must be notified to and requires the approval of each relevant Board.




       The POL Board is asked to consider the proposed appointment and, if agreed, to
       pass a resolution substantially in the form attached as Appendix A.
                                                                                                  POL00103334

                                                  ...

It was noted that Alice Perkins had notified the Board in accordance with article 89(B) of
the Company's Articles of Association that she was proposing to take up a position as a
director of Royal Mail Holdings plc (RMH") and that this could be regarded as reasonably
likely to give rise to a conflict of interest for the purposes of section 175 of the Companies
Act 2006 (the "Act"). The Board considered this interest and position and noted the
potential for certain situations to give rise to a conflict of interest or confl ict of duty. The
Board also noted the terms of the [Letter Agreement from the Department of Business,
Innovation and Skills to Alice Perkins dated [•] regarding the structure of the RMH group,
corporate governance arrangements and the Crown indemnity in favour of Al ice Perkins].

It was resolved that it would promote the success of the Company for Alice Perkins to
remain a director of the Company notwithstanding her position and interest as a director
of RMH and accordingly that such position and interest shall be authorised for the
purposes of section 175 of the Act and in accordance with article 89 of the Articles of
Association, and that such authorisation shall extend to any actual or potential confl ict
which may arise out of the matter so authorised.

The Board may notify Alice Perkins from time to time of any additional obligations or
restrictions that it considers appropriate for her to observe in order to manage the confl ict
situation.

In respect of a matter to which this authority relates, Alice Perkins shall not be obliged to
disclose to the Company any information in respect of which she owes a duty of
confidentiality to a person other than the Company.

This authority may be terminated by the Board at any time.

Subject to any duty of confidentiality, Alice Perkins shall be required to notify the Board
as soon as reasonably practicable if there occurs any other material change of
circumstances of which in her reasonable opinion the Board should be aware if it were
considering granting or renewing any such authorisation.

It was noted that, pursuant to Article 89 and section 175(6) of the Act, the meeting was
quorate without counting Alice Perkins and Alice Perkins did not vote on the foregoing
resolution.

                          by Prosser in June 201_, but
                          POL only made aware in
                          October 2011. POL applied to

                          for procedural error in

1.1      Provide an update on the current status of the Post Office London Games
         2012 Programme.

I:!TL.,l.1IITIt.l


2.1      The overarching aim of the Post Office London Games 2012 Programme is to
         ensure that Post Office Ltd is prepared for the operational challenges it will
         face and take advantage of the Royal Mail Group commercial opportunities
         that the London 2012 Olympic & Paralympic Games (the Games) will offer.
2.2      The Post Office London Games 2012 Programme is a discrete strand of the
         Royal Mail Group (RMG) Olympic Programme. The Post Office London
         Games 2012 Programme operates within the governance of RMG and Post
         Office Ltd's Operating Board.
2.3      All Post Office Ltd activities must be undertaken within the stipulations
         provided by the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic
         Games (LOCOG).

Activities

The following activities feature within the current plan.

Activities to leverage the commercial opportunities of the Olympics
3.1     Support Royal Mail's aim to sell Gold Medal Special Issue Stamps in Post
        Office branches on the day following the Gold Medal being awarded.
3.2     Invite c.500 branches to open on Sunday's during the Games to enable Gold
        Medal Stamps sales from the following day.
3.3     Enable branches to sel l additional licensed Olympic themed items during the
        Games.
3.4     Extend opening hours in key strategic branches.
3.5     Refurbish branches in select locations.
3.6     Offer a Post Office presence in both the athlete's vi llage and the media plaza.

Activities to maintain normal operational activities during the games
3.7     Implementing countermeasures to off-set the impacts arising from the Olympic
        Road Network closures i.e. by changing opening/delivery/collection times.
3.8     Implementing increased branch security arrangements, such as upgrading
        alarms, modifying the safe and alarm settings and increasing the number of
        ATM fogging kits. This is being done where there's increased risk of attack —
        currently this is at circa 100 branches.
3.9     Incorporating Business Continuity within the project to ensure that we have
        plans prepared for the main scenarios and/or threats. The scenarios, which
        include risks such as the failure of the mobile phone network, are being
        determined at cross sector groups of businesses and the Metropolitan Pol ice.
        Post Office Ltd is represented by the Head of Security.
3.10 Publish communications in line with the Communications Plan at the
        appropriate points to both internal and external audiences.
                                                                                            POL00103334
                                                                                          POL001 03334

4.   Current Position

     4.1 _   The core project team, incorporating key stakeholders for each strand is in
             place to enable collaborative delivery of each activity. Roles and
             responsibilities/accountabilities are understood within this team.
     4.2.    The strands are: Business Continuity, Gold Medal Stamps (commercial), HR,
             Network, Security, Supply Chain and Communications. Plans are in place to
             cover the delivery of each strand.
     4.3.    All activities across the strands are expected to be delivered in time for the
             start of the Games.
     4.4.    The Post Office London Games 2012 Programme has a regular feed into the
             RMG Programme Board and into the Post Office Operating Board for progress
             reporting and validation.
     4.5.    The LOCOG stipulation in terms of branding and restricted products are
             extremely challenging and work is in progress to address these areas.
     4.6.    The communication of HR related information concerning attendance at work
             during the Games (reduction in BAU travel demands by 30%) has been
             absorbed within this programme.



     5.1.    Existing Business Continuity Plans may not be adequate for the challenges
             presented by the Games. This is being investigated within the Business
             Continuity strand.
     5.2.    Additional work is required to assess our partner's levels of preparation. These
             assessments will determine their readiness to support our operations, as well
             as identifying good practices that Post Office Ltd could readily adopt.
     5.3.    The mechanism by which the reduction in attendance at 148 Old Street will be
             delivered has yet to be fully defined. A separate piece of work is being
             commissioned to address this and progress wi ll be reported into the Operating
             Board.
     5.4.    There is a risk that Royal Mai l will be unable to produce and distribute the
             Gold Medal Special Issue Stamps in time to go on sale the day following the
             award of the Gold Medal. Royal Mail will be running tests to ensure that they
             have the abi lity to deliver against this activity.

     The Board is asked to:

     6.1.    Note the current status of the Post Office Ltd London Games Programme.

The purpose of this paper is to outline the key elements of an effective privacy compliance
strategy, to be implemented over the coming financial year.
               •




       2.1    Post Office Limited has not previously had a defined strategy to deliver
              compliance with privacy legislation, although significant progress has been
              made in the last six months in establishing basic elements of governance,
              delivering training and ensuring that projects fully take account of privacy
              requirements and concerns.

       2.2    The identified activities are designed to both deliver compl iance and to assist
              in developing a broader culture of compliance'. To support the latter, the
              strategy is based on three 'pil lars':

              •    Ownership and responsibility (people): ensuring senior ownership of
                   compliance obligations, real commitment to achieving compliance, and
                   allocated roles and clarity of responsibil ities, reporting and accountability.

              •    Standards and policies (process): developing an appropriate set of
                   accessible, coherent and consistent standards and policies which
                   document compliance.

              •    Effective implementation (delivery): implementing procedures for putting
                   the standards into practice, including staff training and guidance for those
                   with the relevant responsibilities, and putting in place ongoing monitoring
                   to ensure standards are met.

       2.3    The privacy laws affecting the handling of personal information or privacy of
              individuals by POL principally comprise the Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA)
              and associated regulations; and the Privacy & Electronic Communications
              (EC Directive) Regulations 2003. The UK regulator in this area is the
              Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) which has wide-ranging powers to
              investigate, seize data and levy fines, if it believes that a business is not
              complying with the DPA or PECR_

       2.4    European privacy legislation is changing: it is proposed that the EU Directive,
              which is the basis of current UK legislation, wi l l be repealed and a new
              general legal framework for data protection wil l be contained in a new, directly
              applicable regulation. It is unlikely that the new regulation wi ll be adopted
              before early 2014 and EU Member States will then have a two year transition
              period before it becomes effective. A draft new regulation has already been
              published which sets out changes to almost every area of law relating to data
              processing. Whilst it is likely that there will be changes to this draft, the ICO
              has already indicated which areas of the draft it actively supports; this
              provides some indication of the areas which organisations should focus on.
              Ignoring the potential changes at this stage could lead to costly amendments
                                                                                       POL00103334
                                                                                     POL001 03334



                    Post Office Ltd — Strictly Confidential

      to any new pol icies and procedures once the changes in law come into effect.
      It is therefore recommended that as part of the proposed gap analysis, current
      practices are measured against both existing and proposed legislation.



3.1   In 2006, the ICO received a complaint about the inappropriate disposal of
      confidential waste at a franchised Post Office branch in Southampton. As a
      result, the ICO made an adverse assessment against POL. By way of
      resolution, POL gave an undertaking in February 2007 in relation to a number
      of actions to ensure future DPA compliance. The ICO and POL also agreed
      on an inspection to establish whether branches were acting in line with the
      undertaking. This inspection was completed and the September 2008 report
      on it included ten recommendations to mitigate against future breaches. Since
      a further review in 2009, there has been little or no follow-up activity to ensure
      these actions are sti ll effective.

3.2   Given this background, if the undertaking were breached, the ICO might be
      expected to instigate a further investigation and give serious consideration to
      issuing an enforcement notice. This might require POL to cease processing
      personal data immediately; and/or to take specific steps within a set period of
      time. The ICO also has power to fine organisations up to £500,000 for
      significant DPA breaches.

3.3   In October 2011 a similar data protection incident occurred at a franchised
      (agency) branch in Hove. POL conducted an investigation and identified that
      six client business partners' product lines were involved and that more than
      130 customers' details were potentially compromised. Corrective actions
      have been implemented, including the deployment of data protection training
      across the entire Network in March 2012. Additionally, branch audits now
      include specific questions about the disposal and retention of confidential
      waste. POL reported this incident to the ICO and although the ICO confirmed
      that it intended to investigate the incident, no action has yet been taken.



4.1   Several data protection driven compliance initiatives are already under-way,
      however these are not currently part of a cohesive strategic approach to
      privacy compliance. From a compliance perspective, this creates a risk that
      work may be duplicated, some key compliance activities may not be
      addressed, and that POL may still have significant gaps in its compliance
      infrastructure. These activities are as follows:

4.2   Data audit/Data Strategy Programme: POL has recognised that its privacy
      compliance is immature and that the lack of a consistent approach to
      customer data ownership and use exposes POL to risk of DPA non-
      compliance. This also affects POL's ability to fully utilise customer data and to
      effectively protect POL's position when entering into commercial relationships
      with business partners. At the end of 2010, a data audit initiative was set up to
      review existing client-facing contracts and customer terms and conditions,
      identifying their current status and the steps necessary to address any
      deficiencies. The first stage (reviewing the current position on fair processing
      notices and contract clauses) was completed at the end of 2011. Phase 2 will
      deliver a `house position' including data protection standard clauses for client-
      facing contracts, and new fair processing notices which will allow us to use our
      customer data fairly and lawfully, and in a way that supports our customer
      data strategy.
                                                                                                 POL00103334
                                                                                               POL001 03334



                             Post Office Ltd — Strictly Confidential


       4.3     Defining POL's Data Strategy: There is also a need to identify POL's
               approach to client and business acquisition, and the type of client/customer
               relationships we want to develop in the future. This needs to take account of
               the strategic direction of the business and identify what compliance support is
               required. This work has begun but is still in its early stages.

       4.4     Separation driven compliance activities: RMG currently provides some DPA
               and Freedom of Information Act (FOI) support to POL (primarily relating to
               DPA subject access requests and responding to FOI requests) but from
               October 2012 this support will cease and POL will take on these activities in
               full . POL is now working towards setting up its own FOI and DPA
               infrastructure to manage these activities.

       Proposed strategy

       5.1     The POL Risk & Compliance team proposes to implement a cohesive
               programme of activity to support compliance with privacy laws and to prepare
               for the new privacy regime. This wi ll bring together the existing activities
               outl ined above, and those compliance deliverables which are riot currently
               being addressed.

       5.2     The first step will be to undertake a high level gap analysis to identify the
               current level of privacy compl iance across POL against an agreed set of legal
               and regulatory requirements. Even though we already know, to an extent,
               where we need to focus our attention (eg establishing a governance and
               compliance infrastructure, training, policies, processes and procedures etc) -
               based on previous work, including the 2009 internal audit report on data
               protection - this analysis will more effectively engage the business, provide
               hard evidence to support the need for the action, and define the budget and
               resource required.

       5.3     Fol lowing this, the team will develop an action plan, broken down into work-
               streams, based on a risk assessment and taking account of the cost of risk
               mitigation, to close the gap between the current situation and an agreed
               standard of data protection/privacy compliance. The plan will include
               stakeholder communication, resource required and appropriate timeframes.
               The work-streams likely to be included in the plan to achieve an acceptable
               standard of privacy compliance are as follows: fair processing notices;
               ensuring legitimacy of data processing; regulatory notification; security
               training; data quality; individual rights; disclosures and legal contracts; data
               transfers and export; and governance arrangements. It should be noted that
               an 'acceptable standard' of privacy compliance will differ between different
               organisations and depend upon factors such as business sector, types of
               processing activities undertaken and the risk appetite of the organisation.



The 2007 Undertaking means that POL has a higher risk profile in relation to privacy. If POL
is investigated again by the ICO the current lack of a robust compliance programme and
infrastructure would leave POL exposed. Additionally, the changing regulatory landscape
means that POL will inevitably need to demonstrate a much higher level of compl iance than
historically required. Failure to comply with privacy laws can, of course, lead to substantial
fines, damage to reputation, affect our ability to effectively use customer data and ultimately
win new business. The strategy set out in the paper seeks to address this situation, and to
allow POL to develop its commercial strategy around data on the basis of greater confidence
in its privacy compliance.

At the January Post Office Board, the Board endorsed the decision to move suppliers
from BT Wholesale to Fujitsu Services for the provision of our telecoms services
(HomePhone and Broadband).

This noting paper is intended to provide an update on the contractual negotiations that
have been ongoing with Fujitsu Services since the January Board meeting.

      •    The negotiations are progressing well
      •    There are 4 areas that are still to be agreed:
                    Parent Company Guarantee
               o




                    Limitations of Liability

               o




                    Number porting arrangements
               o




      •    The financial position has improved by c. £10m over the course of the contract due
           to a regulated price reduction implemented by Ofcom
      •    It is our intention to be in a position to sign a contract at the end of March post
           Separation.

        Purpose       The purpose of this paper is to:
        1.1   update the Board on progress with the Fujitsu Services contract negotiations
              for the provision of our fixed line and broadband telecoms offerings, and
        1.2   seek authority to sign the contract with Fujitsu Services at the end of March
              subject to al l contractual issues being resolved.

2.      Background
        2.1  The decision to switch suppliers from BT Wholesale to Fujitsu Services for the
              provision of our telecoms services was endorsed at the Post Office Board
              meeting in January (POLB12/10).
        2.2  Contractual negotiations have been ongoing with Fujitsu Services since they
             were selected as our preferred bidder and progress is such that we will plan to
              be in a position to sign a contract at the end of March.

        Current Situation
        3.1   There are a number of key areas where solutions still need to be agreed:
              • Parent Company Guarantee — Negotiations are continuing at pace to
                 secure a PCG. The issue has been escalated within Fujitsu Services.
              • Limitations of Liability — Fujitsu Services' proposal limits their liability to
                 125% of our charges' which equates to -420m in year 1 and —F28m by
                 year 5. We are seeking to increase the limit to 150%_
              • Benchmarking and continuous improvement — TalkTalk, Fujitsu
                 Services' network subcontractor, are resisting any form of contractual
                 mechanism relating to benchmarking. Fujitsu do accept that there are
                 benefits for them and their partners in maintaining price alignment with the
                 marker and they have already accepted benchmarking mechanisms in
                 relation to the provision of their contact centre services. We are working
                 through a number of options with the prospective suppliers that would give
                 us a similar level of comfort in relation to network services.
              • Number porting arrangements — TalkTalk do not currently have a number
                 porting agreement with Virgin Media (meaning we would struggle to target
                 Virgin customers as they would have to change their phone number in
                 order to switch). This has been escalated with Fujitsu Services and they
                 believe such an agreement will be in place by April 2013.
              • The financial position presented in January has improved by —£1Om over
                 the 5 year agreement. This change is due to benefits driven by Ofcom price
                 controls (regulated products) being passed through to POL.

4.      Conclusion & Recommendations
        4.1   Negotiations with Fujitsu Services are progressing well and despite a handful
              of issues still to be resolved, we plan to sign the contract on schedule.
        42    The POL Board is asked to note that negotiations are progressing as planned
              and to agree that, subject to reaching agreement on the areas identified in
              paragraph 3, we should sign the agreement with Fujitsu Services.




 Network charges are excluded from the liability calculation.

     Purpose
     The purpose of this paper is:

     1.1    To inform the Board of the implications of a pending RMG tariff increase.

2.   Background
     2.1  Each year RMG undertake a price (tariff) change in quarter 1, subject to
          Postcomm approval. This covers the following services offered via POL; 1 S'
          and 2 „d Class stamps, the Special Delivery family (by 9am and by 1pm
          delivery), Recorded Signed For, Parcelforce products and International
          Services.
     2.2  The price increases this year will be higher than in previous years with an
          average increase of 33% compared to 12% in 2011. The main key increases
          are set out in the table below.

                     Service         Weight        Price Increase
                     1 c Letter      Up to 100g          30%
                     2c Letter       Up to 100g          39%
                     Special
                     Delivery        Up to 100g           8%
                     1 c Packet      Up to 100g          71%
                                     Up to 250g          38%
                                     Up to 500g           9%
                                     Up to 750g         -11%
                     2c Packet       Up to 100g          65%
                                     Up to 250g         28%
                                     Upto500g             2%
                                     Up to 750g         -16%

     2.3    These annual price changes create ever growing gaps between what is
            charged in competing SME mails payment channels (Franking and RMG
            accounts) and what POL charges its customers for similar services.
     2.4    Tariff increases tend to attract a degree of consumer discontent which is
            usually focused around the increases in 15t and 2111 Class stamps. This could
            be particularly pronounced as the increases are significantly higher than in
            previous years.


     Points to Note
     3.1    POL has conducted a review of the above and has concluded the following
            key points:
            • RMG has informed POL that it expects to see a decline in postage labels
               volumes as follows; 19% 1 St class and 17% 21d class. If these declines are
               accurate then POL would lose up to £18m in labels income next year. This
               would be partly offset by an upside in stamp income of £7m. (POL
                receives postage label income at a flat rate which increases annual ly by a
               factor of RPI-1 and a percentage of total revenue for stamp sales, this
                                                                                                  POL00103334
                                                                                                POL001 03334




                           Post Office Ltd — In Strictest Confidence


                  explains why stamps income would increase and labels reduce in this
                  scenario)
               • However, at the outset of financial year 11/12 RMG expected to see a
                   labels decline of 10% for 1st class labels and 10% for 2 class labels over
                  the year. The actual results were a 3% decline in 1 5t class labels and a
                  23% increase in 2n" class labels. This suggests that RN1G have not been
                  accurate at forecasting market activity to date, and that the real ity is that
                  there is an element of down trading to 2nd class which is likely to continue.
                  Overall this would suggest that POL volumes are relatively resilient to tariff
                   increases.
       3.5     The full impact of a large tariff increase on the rate of volume decline remains
               uncertain for a number of reasons:
               • there is no UK precedent for a mails price increase on the scale of this
                  year
               • the level of press interest, consumer groups and small business interest
                  groups in the tariff change is uncertain and wi ll drive customer behaviour
               • there is a risk of aggressive advertising by the franking industry aimed at
                  small business and eBay customers
       3.6     A large tariff increase in 1 5t and 2nd Class, especially in the event of broad
               media interest, would increase pressure on POL to del iver on plans for
               improving our small business proposition.

4.     Conclusion
       4.1 Overall, the extent to which POL volumes are impacted by price increases wi ll
           depend to some degree on the avai labi lity of credible retail alternatives for
           customers and at present these are very marginal. The proposed tariff
           increases for 12;13 are unlikely to change this situation_
       4.2 The risk that POL will lose business customers to the franking industry is
           minimised by the proposed packet price increases. The planned increase for
           the franking industry this year is higher than that proposed for POL customers in
           most weight steps over 250g (Appendix 1 shows a comparison between POL
           and franking industry proposed tariff changes for 12/13). POL wi ll remain
           competitive as 70% of its 1st class, and 71% of its 2nd class packet volumes
           weigh 250g and above.
       4.3 The POL mails team will continue to monitor the impact of tariff increases. While
           RMG expect volumes to decline and mix to change we do not believe that this
           will play out as past history has shown POL volumes to be resilient. The table
           below shows how POL volumes have reacted to price change over the last four
           years. POL therefore expects its 12/13 Mails operating plan to remain whole.

1. Purpose

The purpose of this paper is to:

   1.1. Brief the board on the Horizon service.
   1.2. Update the board on the recent major incidents on Horizon.
   1.3. Outline the actions being taken to prevent further failures.




   2.1. The recent incident on Horizon was the fourth significant service failure of this
        system in nine months. Briefly summarised, they are:
           • 27th July 2011 — Pin pad failure caused by a change activity
           • 12th December 2011 — Horizon service failure caused by a hardware failure
           • 1St February 2012 — Card account failure caused by a change activity
           • 1St March 2012 — Horizon service failure caused by a hardware failure
   2.2. When the Horizon service was initially constructed it was based across two data
        centres, both of which were fully operational; providing an active/active resilient
        service arrangement.
   2.3. As part of the move to Horizon on Line, the contract was renegotiated and the
        architectural design changed in order to reduce Post Office's operating costs by
        £50m p.a. (excluding VAT). One of the design changes which contributed
        significantly (circa £5.5m p.a.) to the savings was moving to an active/passive data
        centre arrangement. Consequently the resilience is now housed in one data centre
        with the second data centre primarily being used as a test environment, but available
        for disaster recovery if required.
   2.4. As a consequence of moving to the active /passive design, when hardware issues
        arise they will result in network wide service disruption.
   2.5. The previous active/active data centre arrangement would have prevented an impact
        to customers for the incidents of the 12th December and the 1St March, as the
        hardware would still have been working in the other data centre.
   2.6. The level of risk associated with this design is being challenged in light of our future
        business strategy.


3. Current Situation — Incidents

   3.1. The incident on the 1St March was caused by a network router within the data centre
        restricting the flow of transactions to the data centre. As it was in effect still working,
        the device advertised itself as available and no alert was raised.
   3.2. The router started failing just after 11 am and from that point on branches would have
        seen transactions going through the system much slower than normal. Many
        transactions were going through so slowly that they timed out. From around 11:10
        we were seeing less than a fifth of the expected volume going through the system;
        and the situation continued to deteriorate.
   3.3. By 14:15 Fujitsu had identified the component causing the issue and was
        subsequently removed from the live service. The service was restored at 14:25.
                                                                                                 POL00103334
                                                                                               POL001 03334



                             Post Office Ltd — Strictly Confidential

   3.4. In terms of the two hardware failures, these related to different components within
        the Horizon data centre. Whilst backup devices were available in both cases they
        didn't activate due to the way in which the failing hardware acted.
   3.5. With regards to the two incidents that were caused by change activities. Both of
        these relate to updating our product reference data on Horizon. July's incident was
        due to the correct processes not being followed. Whereas February's incident was
        due to the test processes for reference data changes and changes del ivered through
        a programmed release not being ful ly cognisant of each other.
   3.6. All of the above incidents are subject to ongoing operational investigations. A
        number of changes have already been made to both the reference data processes
        and to the hardware. See section 6 for further details about the proposal for a
        strategic review to complement the actions that are already underway to prevent
        recurrence.


4. Service Levels

   4.1. The availability service level is measured across the network of counter positions
        where they are able to perform al l transactions. The Counter Availability metric is
        defined as the number of counter position hours available as a proportion of the
        maximum number of counter position hours available based upon the Post Office
        Core Day (08:00hrs — 18:00hrs Mon — Fri , 08:00-13:00 Sat).
   4.2. Liquidated damages (£3.50 per unavai lable counter hour) are payable if the
        unavailable counter hours per month exceed the equivalent of 2.37 hours per
        counter in the month.
   4.3. If the cause of unavai lability is a network wide failure event then the contract allows
        Fujitsu to cap the damages at £400k for that event.
   4.4. This has resulted in the following in respect of the four incidents:
            • July's incident — a settlement of £250k was agreed
            • December's incident — no Liquidated Damages are due as the total
                unavailability in the month did not exceed 2.37 hours per counter
            • February's incident — yet to be confirmed but looks unlikely that Liquidated
                Damages will be due as the availability in the rest of the month was good and
                overall unavailability in the month did not exceed 2.37 hours
            • March's incident — the amount of Liquidated Damages due is dependent on
                the performance in rest of the month.




   5.1. Since the move to Horizon on Line the disaster recovery service has undergone
        several tests, incrementally these provide a level of assurance. A full data centre
        failover is the only test which hasn't yet been proven and is an outstanding risk which
        we aim to address at the end of the month.
   5.2. The data centre failover which provides the end to end test assurance means failing
        over from the active data centre to the passive data centre and is scheduled for the
        weekend of 31st March/1 St April. This will be the first of its kind since the move to the
        active/passive data centre set up.
   5.3. Credence is also hosted in the Fujitsu data centre. Last year Credence had no
        disaster recovery service and was involved in the process of del ivering transaction
        files to clients. Therefore had we conducted the end to end disaster recovery test at
        that time it would have meant holding back client transaction flies for 3 days. This
        risk was deemed unacceptable.
   5.4. Business cases have been approved and action taken to move the delivery of client
        files from the Credence environment. This service moved from February and enables
        the data centre failover test to take place without the risking the delivery of files to
        clients.

   6.1. We will continue to conduct the operational investigations into each incident and
        make the improvements required to ensure the short term stability of the service.
   6.2. In recognition of the recent performance history, the media attention this has drawn
        and our business transformation plans, we have proposed a fundamental review of
        the service and strategy. Within this review we wil l draw out whether the current
        technical design is correct for our future business needs and plans. The review will
        run in conjunction with the operational investigations.
   6.3. We are proposing that the review will be conducted by Fujitsu and Post Office Ltd
        with involvement from independent partners. The review will run under the
        governance of a steering board consisting of the Executives from both organisations.
   6.4. The review will as a minimum cover:
           • The technical design of Horizon
           • All forms of testing
           • Monitoring and alerting
           • Best practice in retail and financial service markets
           • Future requirements of our business strategy that may influence the technical
               environment of which Horizon is a critical part.
   6.5. The POL Board and the POL Executive Team will be invited to visit the data centres
        and receive regular updates on the progress and findings of this review.

The purpose of this paper is to:

       1.1     Appoint Yorkshire Bank as Bankers to Post Office Limited.

2.     Background

       2.1    Post Office Limited has signed a contract with Yorkshire Bank Merchant
              Services to process credit and debit card payments. In order to continue to
              receive cleared funds into our account the day after the transaction, Post
              Office is required to open a bank account with Yorkshire Bank.
       2.2    This account is to be operated under the same principles as currently in
              operation for the all other bank accounts. There are two appointed signatory
              groups:
              • The Control Panel is responsible for the maintenance of the account, can
                  open and close accounts with Yorkshire Bank, change signatory groups,
                  and can approve changes to both signatory groups.
              ■ The Signature Panel operates the account on a day to day basis, and
                  approves payments.
              No person can be a member of both panels. The current list of panel
              members is shown in Appendix 2.



The POL Board is asked to:

       3.1    Approve the appointment of Yorkshire Bank as Bankers to Post Office Ltd.

            Extract from the minutes of a Board meeting of Post Office Limited held at
                       148 Old Street, London EC1V 9HQ on 15t—" March 2012



"It was resolved that a Sub-Committee be formed to give effect to the legal requirements
necessary for the Transaction to move Post Office Limited to become a sister company of

               (a)   Nick Kennett gave the Board an oral update on the Eagle
                     negotiations. He explained the problems with the valuation of
ACTION:              the future portfolio which would be sold when the contract
Les Owen             expired. Les Owen suggested an alternative proposal and the
                     Chairman asked that Les Owen and Nick Kennett convene after
ACTION:              the meeting to discuss. Nick Kennett to send a note round to the
Nick Kennett         Board to summarise the discussion;

               (b)   Nick Kennett reported that the Bank had re-opened discussions
                     on FSR numbers, an area which they had previously dropped in
                     the Heads of Terms. The Chairman told Nick Kennett to relay
ACTION:              the Board's disappointment that this issue, which they thought
Nick Kennett         had been settled, was now being re-opened.

POLB12/28                INFRASTRUCTURE (IT AND PROCUREMENT)

                   (a)   Lesley Sewell explained the IT Strategy for the next 3 years which
                         will support the wider business activity, procure circa 60 IT contracts
                         and deliver the cost reduction challenge. The Board discussed the
                         Strategy which involves the proposed introduction of a Service
                         Integrator (SI) to manage IT providers. Les Owen asked if the SI
                         would be allowed to provide any of the work towers in the
                         framework of suppl iers. (POL(12)28 Appendix 2). Lesley Sewell
                         explained that the SI would only supply the service desk but no
                         other tower;

                   (b)   Lesley Sewell emphasised that the business lacked the capability
                         and maturity to manage the changes required to deliver the future
                         IT infrastructure. This work was not a core competency and it made
                         more sense to outsource. She stressed the importance of getting
                         the SI contract terms correct and getting good governance in place
                         to manage that contract;

                   (c)   Chris Day assured the Board that the SI and contracts would
                         include efficiency targets which were already assumed in the
                         budget;

                   (d)   Neil McCausland had suggested at a pre-meet that the SI approach
                         be tested to give the Board some assurance that it was the best
                         solution. Lesley Sewell reported that Berkeley Partnership had
                         reviewed the SI strategy and were supportive of the approach
                         agreeing that the SI would bring the required capabilities to the
                         business;
                                                                                            POL00103334
                                                                                          POL001 03334




                (e)   Paula Vennel ls questioned whether the SI would in fact raise
                      capability, as the same POL staff who were currently working in this
                      area of the business would be TUPE'd over to the SI. Lesley
                      Sewell assured the Board that the contract would insist on raised
                      capability and people would not be retained if they did not achieve
                      the required level. Paula Vennells flagged to the Board that the
                      redundancy cost could return to POL under TUPE rules;

                (f)   Les Owen asked the business to ensure that POL retained the
                      procurement decisions for the tower contracts. Lesley Sewell
                      assured him this was the way the SI contract would be structured.
                      She emphasised that the SI contract negotiation was vital and the
                      business would need to buy-in consultancy support for this work;

                (g)   Lesley Sewell assured the Board that the business would retain and
                      strengthen its in-house resource which would focus on the IT
                      changes needed for new products and services;

                (h)   the Chairman understood that Berkeley Partnership had challenged
                      the concept of the towers within the framework, Lesley Sewell
                      explained that the Berkeley Partnership have suggested other
                      solutions and proposed that the framework could be structured
                      around the business applications. She would take a further look at
ACTION:               a different approach but thought it would be too radical a change for
Lesley Sewell         the business in one go. However, Lesley Sewell assured the Board
                      that changes could be made to the proposal as it developed and the
                      team would keep an open mind;

                (i)   Les Owen asked if the model had been successfully deployed in
                      other organisations. Lesley Sewell reported that she had visited
                      Rolls Royce who were currently moving to the model. She agreed
ACTION:               to find a business who are already successfully using the SI and
Lesley Sewell         similar structure to benchmark. She would look at retail / services
                      sector as well;

                (j)   Neil McCausland asked for an explanation of the Financial overview
                      (POL(12)28 APPENDIX 1) and why the costs were so high for
                      13/14 and 14/15. Lesley Sewell explained that the optimised
                      baseline was based on existing contracts including RP I increases
                      and also included the projects involved in business transformation.
                      Neil McCausland chal lenged the additional costs. He agreed the
                      expenditure of £13.38m to implement the programme, but stated
                      that this did not mean he agreed the targets for subsequent years.
                      The Chairman clarified that the Board were not being asked to
ACTION:               approve the IT Budget for subsequent years and asked Lesley
Lesley Sewell         Sewell and Chris Day to provide a breakdown and explanation of
Chris Day             the optimised expected cost scenarios for the Board;

                (k)   the board endorsed the proposed strategy subject to the points
                      made and authorised expenditure of £13.8m for the implementation
                      of the programme.

                            POST OFFICE LIMITED (THE "COMPANY")

               EXPLANATORY NOTE OF PRINCIPAL CHANGES TO THE
                    COMPANY'S ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION

It is proposed that the Company adopt new articles of association (the "New Articles") in order to
update the Company's current articles of association (the "Current Articles"). The changes
proposed are primarily to reflect the change in the shareholding structure of the Company after
separation from Royal Mail Group Limited ("RMG") but also to take account of the Companies Act
2006 and the Postal Services Act 2011. Please note that the New Articles will need to be further
amended prior to mutualisation.

The principal changes introduced in the New Articles are summarised below:

        Special Share (Articles 10, 11 and 12):
        It is proposed that one special rights redeemable preference share of £0.001 in the capital
        of the Company (the "Special Share") be issued to the Secretary of State (the "Special
        Shareholder"). The New Articles sets out the rights attaching to the Special Share which
        include the fol lowing:

        (a)     consent rights in relation to certain actions of the Company, for example, in relation
                to the appointment or removal of directors, the Chief Executive Officer or
                Chairman, the adoption of a strategic plan and any material variation to it, the
                incurrence of a commitment or liabil ity in excess of £50 mil lion and the incurrence
                of borrowings over £75 mil lion;

        (b)     the right to attend and speak at shareholder meetings of the Company but no right
                to vote at such meetings;

        (c)     the right to repayment of the capital paid up on the Special Share on a distribution
                of capital in a winding-up of the Company in priority to any repayment of capital to
                any other member but no right to a dividend or any other right to participate in the
                capital or profits of the Company; and

        (d)     the right to request information on the affairs of the group and meet with directors
                and senior managers of the Company.

        The rights attaching to the Special Share are exercisable only for such time as the Special
        Shareholder beneficially owns the special share in Royal Mail Holdings plc ("RMH") and
        the special share in RMG.

2       Strategic Plan
        The New Articles provide that the Company must prepare a Strategic Plan for the
        Company's group for the following five financial years each year and agree this with the
        Special Shareholder in accordance with the consultation and approval provisions set out in
        Article 71 of the New Articles.

3       Updates to take account of the Companies Act 2006

        The New Articles reflect changes implemented by the Companies Act 2006, including:

        (a)     the removal of the requirement for the Company to have an authorised share
                capital;

        (b)      removal of the ability for the directors to suspend the registration of share transfers;

        (c)      updates regarding proxy voting on a show of hands;

        (d)      removal of the Chairman's power to a casting vote in general meeting;

        (e)     insertion of provisions allowing companies to communicate with their shareholders
                by electronic means;

        (f)     changes so as to ensure consistency of the directors' indemnity and insurance
                provisions with the new wording of the Companies Act 2006; and

        (g)      updates for adjournment fora lack of quorum at a general meeting.

        Please note that provisions in the Current Articles which repl icate provisions contained in
        the Companies Act 2006 have (for the most part) been removed from the New Articles (e.g.
        notice of general meetings). This is in line with the approach advocated by the Government
        and is also consistent with the approach being taken in the new RMG and RMH articles.




        The Companies Act 2006 significantly reduces the constitutional significance of a
        company's memorandum of association and abolishes the need for companies to have an
        objects clause because, without one, a company's objects are unrestricted. For this
        reason the Company is proposing to remove its objects clause together with al l other
        provisions of its memorandum which, by virtue of the Companies Act 2006, are treated as
        forming part of the Company's articles of association as of 1 October 2009.

        The written resolution to be signed by the Company's sole shareholder wi l l confirm the
        removal of these provisions for the Company. As the effect of this resolution wil l be to
        remove the statement currently in the Company's memorandum of association regarding
        limited liability, the New Articles also contain an express statement regarding the limited
        liabil ity of shareholders.

5       Directors' fees

        Article 77 has been amended in the New Articles so as to provide for an increase in the
        aggregate amount of directors' fees from £300,000 to £400,000 p.a. (excluding salaries).

                           Chairman of the Audit & Risk Committee.



                   (a)     The Board approved the minutes of the meeting held on the 30 th

                           previous meetings.



                   (a)     Paula Vennells provided a business update to the Board on a
                           number of matters including progress with business separation,
                           State Aid, Network Transformation and the recently announced
                           new 10-year commercial agreement between POL and RMG.
                           Des Crowley updated the board on some recent changes to the

                   (a)     CEO Business update for January 2012: POFS continued
                           ahead of budget at the end of December. Profit before
                           Shareholder Distributions for POFS in December was £1.3m -
                           £0.1 m ahead of budget due to higher fixed rate savings
                           breakage fees, lower savings clawbacks partial ly offset by lower

      insurance sales and lower Onl ine Saver balances. Profits before
      Shareholder Distributions YTD at the end of December were
      £15.3m - £3.4m ahead of budget and £172m ahead of last
      year;

(b)   Management were proposing an increase of £0.2m in the year
      end forecast to £19.7m - £2.5m ahead of target; details of risks
      and opportunities to this forecast were included in the Finance
      update. If achieved, this annual profit would be the highest
      underlying profits achieved by the business since start-up;

(c)   Sales YTD to mid-January were at 102% of target — up from
      85% of target at the end of August. The major concerns on
      sales were increasing life insurance sales, maintaining the
      strong momentum on car and home insurance sales and
      mortgage applications. The latter would be helped by new
      pricing proposals in February;

(d)   Average weekly sales in the Crown office network YTD were 9.2
      per branch (week 42) — down from 9.6 sales at end week 33,
      primari ly due to the reduction in Savings sales and the impact of
      the Christmas period. Close management of the FS population
      had increased sales in Credit Cards, and the Home
      Insurance and Car Insurance re-launch had had a positive effect
      to date. Life Insurance sales performance was strong to end
      December but sales in January to date were well behind target;

(e)   Policies in force were at 344,000 by mid-January with an
      increase of 1,300 policies for the first time in two years in
      December and a further 6,600 growth in the first two weeks of
      January. This continues to be closely monitored and a detailed
      paper was presented to the Board later on in the meeting;

(f)   The savings book reached £16.2bn at the end of December -
      with net growth of £2.4bn since the end of March 2011 _ This
      was £2bn ahead of target. However, the business had seen a
      net reduction of £1 67m in January MTD due to lower rates on
      our product range and increased withdrawals from the Onl ine
      Saver product. The forecast for the end of March is £15.9bn and
      the position was being monitored on a dai ly basis to ensure that
      the business achieved the target;

(g)   Mortgage completions were only £40m in December - £45m
      behind target. The impact of applications being well below target
      in the first three quarters of the year was likely to continue to
      affect completions negatively for the rest of the financial year.
      Lower sales were being partially offset by average completion
      values at £173k, 8% higher than target. A re-price of sub-75%
      LTV mortgages would be launched in February to improve the
      overall position. Des Crowley asked the business to make every
      effort to increase the level of mortgage lending;

(h)   there had been 2,383 POFS complaints in December 2011, a
      decrease of 31% compared with November 2011 volumes. The
      overall decrease in complaints in December was driven by a

                        67% (105) decrease in Onl ine Bond Savings complaints, 62%
                        (220) decrease in Cash ISA complaints and 58% (402)
                        decrease in Growth Bond. Paula Vennells asked that the team
ACTION                  consider sending this MI out to the Branch network. Patrick
Patrick Waldron         Waldron would discuss this with Nick Kennett.

                  (i)   Des Crowley thanked Patrick Waldron for the report noting that
                        it had been a good trading period for the business.

                  (a)   POFS' Operating Plan highlighted the importance of retention in
                        FY 2011/12 with circa £10.8bn maturing or coming to the end of
                        a bonus period in the year. Prior to FY 2011/12, retention
                        activity had focused on Growth Bond; however with the
                        introduction of new products during FY 2010/11 (Online Saver
                        and Online Bond) focus on retention had expanded to include
                        the new products and this had been reflected in FY 2011/12
                        balance targets;

                  (b)   the Board would consider Savings retention at its meeting on
ACTION                  the 22 March. Patrick Waldron was asked to add an
Patrick Waldron         assessment of the competitive threat of Virgin Money to the
                        agenda as well.



                  (a)   The Board noted the BRB sales report and AOP summary
                        tracker.

                  (a)   Rob Clarkson joined the meeting and provided an update in
                        relation to Post Office Car and Home Insurance combined
                        policies in force (PIF);

                  (b)   In December the portfolio experienced a net growth in PIF,
                        increasing by 1,318 to 337,703 policies. This continued to
                        improve with net growth of a further 6,607 policies recorded
                        between the 1 ' and 15`"' January. With an historic focus on
                        fourth quarter marketing, the next three months represented a
                        risk of further PIF decline, with over 30% of the current portfolio
                        falling due for renewal. In order to build portfolio momentum
                        through 2012/13, the business had implemented further tactical
                        and strategic initiatives;

                  (c)   POFS had implemented a series of trading actions to maximise
                        the Network's opportunities to succeed, including enhanced
                        propositions, improved pricing, additional incentives and up-
                        weighted marketing. Aggressive aggregator pricing had been
                        deployed and had successfully reversed the declining trend
                        resulting in growth at a rate significantly beyond the original
                        projections. Year-on-year retention performance across both
                        Car and Home was both showing signs of significant
                        improvement also helping accelerate the book growth (January

                        2011 versus January 2012, 52% versus 62% Car, and 66%
                        versus 74% Home). Management were currently considering
                        further actions to ensure that the PIF stabilisation was sustained
                        whilst seeking to protect the short term financial impact;

                  (d)   the Board approved the approach outlined for PIF until the end
                        of March 2012 noting the £500,000 adverse impact on the
                        POFS results, noting that the agreed strategy helped mitigate
                        the financial risk to the business and further enhanced the
                        relationship with Junction.

                  (b)   December YTD of £15.3m PBD was some £3.4m ahead of
                        budget. Strong sales of GILB, savings interest variances and
                        lower marketing spend partially offset by lower car, Home and
                        Life sales and bonus provision;

                  (c)   the key issues for 2011112 remained PIF, sales shortfalls,
                        Online Saver retention and SEM costs. The Board noted a
                        number of risks and opportunities;

ACTION            (d)   Des Crowley asked that the Project Polo costs of £0.7m be
Mike Scott              taken in to account for forecast purposes. The Board agreed the
                        forecast proposed for 2011/12 of £19.7m before Polo costs;

                  (e)   The Board thanked Mike for his report.



ACTION            (a)   Home Insurance Optimisation: The Board noted the update on
Rob Clarkson            Home insurance and asked for a further update on tactics,
                        taking into account the market view, at the March Board;

                  (b)   Commercial Vehicle Contract: The Board noted an update on
                        progress made on establishing the Heads of Terms between
                        BOI and Aviva in respect of extending the exclusive Van
                        Insurance distribution agreement. POFS would conclude the
                        Heads of Terms and work on re-stating the full agreement.

                  (a)   The Board noted an update on Project Polo and agreed to
                        continue with the pilot and to work to develop the business case
                        — based on a range of customer assumptions, consider the
ACTION                  commercial risks and take into account the wider business
Patrick Waldron         strategy. The Board would consider the business case at the
                        March Board.

                              In Strictest Confidence




                  (a)   Patrick Waldron explained that the BRB had recently
                        undertaken an effectiveness exercise with most of the
                        recommendations being agreed and implemented.

ACTION            (b)   Patrick Waldron advised that a recent Yougov Brandlndex
Patrick Waldron         survey had placed the Post Office as the leading brand in
                        banking and financial services. Paula Vennells asked that POFS
                        consider how best to promote this achievement.



                        The next meeting of the Board would be held on Thursday 22nd
                        March 2012.

                        However, the AOP and Sales targets would be discussed at a
                        special meeting to be held after the FRES Board meeting on
                        23 February.

11:U :iplfi:

                  (a)   Kevin Seller circulated a paper (attached as Appendix A to the
                        minutes) showing the estimated contribution for known FOoG
                        opportunities. The Board noted the relative importance of winning
                        the DVLA and Passport contracts. Les Owen asked if Network
                        capacity planning had been undertaken to ensure the business
                        could cope with all the initiatives. Kevin Seller explained that
                        detailed capacity planning was underway, but that many of the new
                        propositions did not use traditional counter time. The Chairman
                        asked how the tensions between Network Transformation and the
                        introduction of new products were being managed. Paula Vennells
                        assured the Board that the Network Director and Commercial
                        Director were both involved in the respective Steering Groups set
                        up to ensure these issues were aligned.

                  (b)   In Neil McCausland's view the biggest commercial opportunity lay in
                        continuing to develop identity checking services and he suggested
                        that the Business should focus on this area as a core strength. He
                        asked why the commercial returns for new contracts were
                        significantly lower than those which were already in place. Kevin
                        Seller explained that the historic contracts with returns of circa 75%
                        were not won through competitive tendering and were not
                        sustainable. He pointed out that the paper POLB(12)17 showed
                        forecast returns from new contracts with a 25% contribution. In
                        reality POL is winning new contracts at between 30 and 40%
                        contribution. Chris Day said that pricing was key to winning these
                        contracts and that although the recent contract wins were small,
                        they would be used to showcase the Business to different
                        Government departments.

                        The Chairman stressed the importance of presenting opportunities
                        to Government departments which facilitated cost savings and
                        assisted digital inclusion.

                                                                                            POL001 03334




                  (c)   DVLA Tender
                        Kevin Seller assured the Board of the strong relationship with DVLA
                        and explained that the main competitor for the tender was likely to
                        be a consortium, possibly with Capita, and Paypoint as its network
                        provider. There seemed to be little appetite for the work from the
                        major banks or supermarkets despite the fact that the competitor
                        analysis showed them as being the most credible network partners.

                        The Chairman asked how the Board could support the tender
ACTION:                 process. Paula Vennells suggested that the tender stakeholder
Kevin Seller            communications plan be circulated to the Board highlighting the
                        Ministers and Officials involved in the decision making processes
                        and detailing how the Board could support this.

ACTION:           (d)   Neil McCausland asked for a more detailed DVLA project plan and
Kevin Seller            resource plan and the incentives in place for the team. Kevin Seller
                        was asked to organise a meeting with Nei l McCausland to take him

                        Chris Day explained that the red status in the Midasgrange Board
                        Minutes related to the migration of N11 databases. The status was
                        currently amber, moving to green as the majority of products had

Pauline Holroyd         Les Owen acknowledged the rigour applied to the PDR scoring
                        system. Chris Day commented that he had also been impressed by
                        the process used by the Business. Paula Vennells stressed that the
                        Post Office was a very honest organisation but that the scores
                        highl ighted a concern with the low number of high achievers. Les
                        Owen explained that he was used to a two-dimensional matrix
                        rating performance and potential. Paula Vennel ls suggested the

POLB12/21               MANAGING DIRECTOR'S REPORT

                  (a)   Pay Review
                        Paula Vennel ls reported that RMG are working with the
                        Communications Workers Union (CWU) on a 3-year profit share
                        payment in return for a no strike deal. She highlighted the CWU's
                        expectation for a similar offer from POL and the potential risk to the
                        plan. Chris Day emphasised that the financial headroom this year
                        did offer an opportunity to the Business if it wanted to offer a
                        payment to help deliver the plan which assumed a pay freeze over
                        the next 3 years. However, such headroom would not be available
                        in FY 12/13. The Chairman challenged whether there was time to
                        negotiate a deal. Neil McCausland stressed that the Business was
                        still under an obl igation to get the Crowns back to break-even, so
                        any solution needed to be sustainable.
ACTION:
Kevin Gilliland         Kevin Gilliland would be asked to provide a cost benefit analysis
                        paper to cover all the options available on Crown pay and their
                        associated risks.

ACTION:                 An additional Board meeting may be required to consider the pay
Aiwen Lyons             mandate in detail.

                  (b)   Budget Meeting — 8 t1 March
                        The Chairman asked that the pre-reading for the meeting should
                        start from the requirements for achieving the strategic plan;
                        highlighting areas where there is scope to exceed the plan;
                        documenting the risks and assumptions in order to demonstrate
                        that the targets have sufficient rigour and stretch.

                        Chris Day explained that work had already taken place to reconcile
                        the original strategic plan back to the budget and that he would be
                        using the meeting to get agreement that the plan contained the
ACTION:                 appropriate stretch and risk. The Chairman asked that key
Chris Day               elements in the plan be highlighted such as Mails and methodology
                        of approach explained.

                  (c)   Quarterly Performance Reviews
                        Paula Vennel ls reported to the Board that Quarterly Performance
                        Reviews were being introduced with individual Directors.

                  (d)   Stamp Pricing
                        Paula Vennel is explained that RMG were planning a significant
                        increase in stamp prices. She assured the Board that Alana
ACTION:                 Renner, the Acting Communications Director, was working closely
Martin Moran            with her counterpart in RM to deal with any adverse PR. Martin
                        Moran to circulate a note covering the effects of the RM price
                        increases on Post Office revenues and margin.

                  (e)   Collections and Returns
                        Paula Vennells reported that a joint presentation had been made at
                        RMH Board which had been very well received.
                                                                                         POL00103334
                                                                                       POL001 03334




               (a)   The Health & Safety Update (POLB(12)20) was noted.



               (a)   Chris Day reported the strong performance in Period 9 had
                     continued in Period 10. He assured the Board that the investment-
                     spend was now on track and that he was ensuring it was being
                     spent appropriately. He explained that a provision of circa £6m may
                     be made in this year to cover the General Insurance Policies in
                     Force risk.

ACTION:              Neil McCausland requested a change to the presentation of the
Chris Day            Insurance Policies data to make the trend information clearer.

POLB12/24            EAGLE UPDATE

               (a)   Nick Kennett explained the twelve workstreams in place to ensure
                     Eagle is achieved. The most challenging of these being: the
                     valuation of Midasgrange; ensuring the correct termination terms
                     are enshrined in the contract and the wider HR effects of the
ACTION:              change. He has a target date of early March for signing the contract
Nick Kennett         and will bring the final agreement to the March Board.

               (b)   Insurance
                     Nick Kennett presented the negotiations mandate to the Board.
                     The Chairman asked how far the proposal would reduce the
                     bureaucracy inherent in the current relationship. Nick Kennett
                     agreed that the current proposal had not been his initial desired
                     outcome but was confident it would work. Les Owen urged the
                     Business to retain as much control as possible over product design
                     and marketing. Paula Vennells explained that the relationships
ACTION:              between the two businesses would be very important.
Alwen Lyons
                     Nick Kennett said that Government concurrence to the contract
                     extension had not been received. Les Owen expressed concern at
                     the potential impact on signing Eagle. Nick Kennett did not
                     anticipate any issues but confirmed that the delay in BIS sign-off
                     risked the achievement of the critical path as the Bank would not
                     proceed on other matter's until the extension was confirmed.

POLB12/26            ANY OTHER BUSINESS
               (a)   The issue of aggravated robbery and burglary had been raised at
ACTION:              RMH Board and the Chairman asked that future Health & Safety
Alwen Lyons          reports include a report on any incidents.

                  The risk would also be raised with the Audit, Risk and Compliance
                  Committee for future monitoring.

            (b)   Separation
                  The Chairman updated the Board on the likely agreed structure for
                  the Group post separation. POL would sit as a sister company to
                  Royal Mail Group under a very thin TopCo consisting of the
                  Chairmen of both Companies. Responsibility for the businesses
                  would sit with the respective Boards.

            (c)   The Chairman informed the Board of several Non-Executive
                  Director candidates under consideration and three possible
                  candidates for the Chair of Audit.

11:U :iplfi:

                  (a)   Kevin Seller circulated a paper (attached as Appendix A to the
                        minutes) showing the estimated contribution for known FOoG
                        opportunities. The Board noted the relative importance of winning
                        the DVLA and Passport contracts. Les Owen asked if Network
                        capacity planning had been undertaken to ensure the business
                        could cope with all the initiatives. Kevin Seller explained that
                        detailed capacity planning was underway, but that many of the new
                        propositions did not use traditional counter time. The Chairman
                        asked how the tensions between Network Transformation and the
                        introduction of new products were being managed. Paula Vennells
                        assured the Board that the Network Director and Commercial
                        Director were both involved in the respective Steering Groups set
                        up to ensure these issues were aligned.

                  (b)   In Neil McCausland's view the biggest commercial opportunity lay in
                        continuing to develop identity checking services and he suggested
                        that the Business should focus on this area as a core strength. He
                        asked why the commercial returns for new contracts were
                        significantly lower than those which were already in place. Kevin
                        Seller explained that the historic contracts with returns of circa 75%
                        were not won through competitive tendering and were not
                        sustainable. He pointed out that the paper POLB(12)17 showed
                        forecast returns from new contracts with a 25% contribution. In
                        reality POL is winning new contracts at between 30 and 40%
                        contribution. Chris Day said that pricing was key to winning these
                        contracts and that although the recent contract wins were small,
                        they would be used to showcase the Business to different
                        Government departments.

                        The Chairman stressed the importance of presenting opportunities
                        to Government departments which facilitated cost savings and
                        assisted digital inclusion.

                                                                                            POL001 03334




                  (c)   DVLA Tender
                        Kevin Seller assured the Board of the strong relationship with DVLA
                        and explained that the main competitor for the tender was likely to
                        be a consortium, possibly with Capita, and Paypoint as its network
                        provider. There seemed to be little appetite for the work from the
                        major banks or supermarkets despite the fact that the competitor
                        analysis showed them as being the most credible network partners.

                        The Chairman asked how the Board could support the tender
ACTION:                 process. Paula Vennells suggested that the tender stakeholder
Kevin Seller            communications plan be circulated to the Board highlighting the
                        Ministers and Officials involved in the decision making processes
                        and detailing how the Board could support this.

ACTION:           (d)   Neil McCausland asked for a more detailed DVLA project plan and
Kevin Seller            resource plan and the incentives in place for the team. Kevin Seller
                        was asked to organise a meeting with Nei l McCausland to take him
                        through the FOoG communications plan.

ACTION:           (e)   The Chairman informed the Board that the DVLA tender would
Paula Vennells          return to the July Board meeting but if any significant changes
                        arose in the interim they would be reported to the Board.

                  (a)   The minutes of the meeting of 12 January 2012 were agreed;

                  (b)   the minutes of the Health & Safety Sub-Committee (POLBSC-
                        HS(12)1st) were noted.



                  (a)   No. 5d (POI._.B12/02/(b))
                        Chris Day explained that the red status in the Midasgrange Board
                        Minutes related to the migration of N11 databases. The status was
                        currently amber, moving to green as the majority of products had
                        now been successfully migrated. ACTION CLOSED

Chris Day               Chris Day confirmed that POL's Going Concern status would be
April                   covered within the RMG consolidation for this year, and that a
                        paper would be provided to the Board in due course on the
                        proposed Going Concern process/external audit for FY 12/13.

Pauline Holroyd         Les Owen acknowledged the rigour applied to the PDR scoring
                        system. Chris Day commented that he had also been impressed by
                        the process used by the Business. Paula Vennells stressed that the
                        Post Office was a very honest organisation but that the scores
                        highl ighted a concern with the low number of high achievers. Les
                        Owen explained that he was used to a two-dimensional matrix
                        rating performance and potential. Paula Vennel ls suggested the
                        inclusion of potential ratings for the Top Team in the succession
                        planning paper at the April Board (subsequently changed to May).

POLB12/21               MANAGING DIRECTOR'S REPORT

                  (a)   Pay Review
                        Paula Vennel ls reported that RMG are working with the
                        Communications Workers Union (CWU) on a 3-year profit share
                        payment in return for a no strike deal. She highlighted the CWU's
                        expectation for a similar offer from POL and the potential risk to the
                        plan. Chris Day emphasised that the financial headroom this year
                        did offer an opportunity to the Business if it wanted to offer a
                        payment to help deliver the plan which assumed a pay freeze over
                        the next 3 years. However, such headroom would not be available
                        in FY 12/13. The Chairman challenged whether there was time to
                        negotiate a deal. Neil McCausland stressed that the Business was
                        still under an obl igation to get the Crowns back to break-even, so
                        any solution needed to be sustainable.
ACTION:
Kevin Gilliland         Kevin Gilliland would be asked to provide a cost benefit analysis
                        paper to cover all the options available on Crown pay and their
                        associated risks.

ACTION:                 An additional Board meeting may be required to consider the pay
Aiwen Lyons             mandate in detail.

                  (b)   Budget Meeting — 8 t1 March
                        The Chairman asked that the pre-reading for the meeting should
                        start from the requirements for achieving the strategic plan;
                        highlighting areas where there is scope to exceed the plan;
                        documenting the risks and assumptions in order to demonstrate
                        that the targets have sufficient rigour and stretch.

                        Chris Day explained that work had already taken place to reconcile
                        the original strategic plan back to the budget and that he would be
                        using the meeting to get agreement that the plan contained the
ACTION:                 appropriate stretch and risk. The Chairman asked that key
Chris Day               elements in the plan be highlighted such as Mails and methodology

                                                                                       POL001 03334




               (a)   The Health & Safety Update (POLB(12)20) was noted.



               (a)   Chris Day reported the strong performance in Period 9 had
                     continued in Period 10. He assured the Board that the investment-
                     spend was now on track and that he was ensuring it was being
                     spent appropriately. He explained that a provision of circa £6m may
                     be made in this year to cover the General Insurance Policies in
                     Force risk.

ACTION:              Neil McCausland requested a change to the presentation of the
Chris Day            Insurance Policies data to make the trend information clearer.

POLB12/24            EAGLE UPDATE

               (a)   Nick Kennett explained the twelve workstreams in place to ensure
                     Eagle is achieved. The most challenging of these being: the
                     valuation of Midasgrange; ensuring the correct termination terms
                     are enshrined in the contract and the wider HR effects of the
ACTION:              change. He has a target date of early March for signing the contract
Nick Kennett         and will bring the final agreement to the March Board.

               (b)   Insurance
                     Nick Kennett presented the negotiations mandate to the Board.
                     The Chairman asked how far the proposal would reduce the
                     bureaucracy inherent in the current relationship. Nick Kennett
                     agreed that the current proposal had not been his initial desired
                     outcome but was confident it would work. Les Owen urged the
                     Business to retain as much control as possible over product design
                     and marketing. Paula Vennells explained that the relationships
ACTION:              between the two businesses would be very important.
Alwen Lyons
                     Nick Kennett said that Government concurrence to the contract
                     extension had not been received. Les Owen expressed concern at
                     the potential impact on signing Eagle. Nick Kennett did not
                     anticipate any issues but confirmed that the delay in BIS sign-off
                     risked the achievement of the critical path as the Bank would not
                     proceed on other matter's until the extension was confirmed.

               (a)   Les Owen challenged the statement made at the January Board
                     that POL could be certain it was not involved with any injury referral
                     fees. Paula Vennells explained that data was only passed to a third
                     party if the customer asked for this action to be taken. Les Owen
                     explained he had two fundamental issues that we should be mindful
                     of; TCF in a growing FS Business, and also the possible bad PR if
                     we are shown to be involved in referral fees.
ACTION:
                     Paula Vennel ls asked for a formal referrals policy to be agreed with
Nick Kennett   (b)   Junction ensuring no active encouragement of personal injury
                     referrals unless requested by the customer. This would be copied
               (C)   to the Board as a future noting paper.
ACTION:
Nick Kennett         Nick Kennett would also investigate the flow of fees to ensure that
                     there is no inducement for wrong behaviours.

POLB12/28                INFRASTRUCTURE (IT AND PROCUREMENT)

                   (a)   Lesley Sewell explained the IT Strategy for the next 3 years which
                         will support the wider business activity, procure circa 60 IT contracts
                         and deliver the cost reduction challenge. The Board discussed the
                         Strategy which involves the proposed introduction of a Service
                         Integrator (SI) to manage IT providers. Les Owen asked if the SI
                         would be allowed to provide any of the work towers in the
                         framework of suppl iers. (POL(12)28 Appendix 2). Lesley Sewell
                         explained that the SI would only supply the service desk but no
                         other tower;

                   (b)   Lesley Sewell emphasised that the business lacked the capability
                         and maturity to manage the changes required to deliver the future
                         IT infrastructure. This work was not a core competency and it made
                         more sense to outsource. She stressed the importance of getting
                         the SI contract terms correct and getting good governance in place
                         to manage that contract;

                   (c)   Chris Day assured the Board that the SI and contracts would
                         include efficiency targets which were already assumed in the
                         budget;

                   (d)   Neil McCausland had suggested at a pre-meet that the SI approach
                         be tested to give the Board some assurance that it was the best
                         solution. Lesley Sewell reported that Berkeley Partnership had
                         reviewed the SI strategy and were supportive of the approach
                         agreeing that the SI would bring the required capabilities to the
                         business;
                                                                                            POL00103334
                                                                                          POL001 03334




                (e)   Paula Vennel ls questioned whether the SI would in fact raise
                      capability, as the same POL staff who were currently working in this
                      area of the business would be TUPE'd over to the SI. Lesley
                      Sewell assured the Board that the contract would insist on raised
                      capability and people would not be retained if they did not achieve
                      the required level. Paula Vennells flagged to the Board that the
                      redundancy cost could return to POL under TUPE rules;

                (f)   Les Owen asked the business to ensure that POL retained the
                      procurement decisions for the tower contracts. Lesley Sewell
                      assured him this was the way the SI contract would be structured.
                      She emphasised that the SI contract negotiation was vital and the
                      business would need to buy-in consultancy support for this work;

                (g)   Lesley Sewell assured the Board that the business would retain and
                      strengthen its in-house resource which would focus on the IT
                      changes needed for new products and services;

                (h)   the Chairman understood that Berkeley Partnership had challenged
                      the concept of the towers within the framework, Lesley Sewell
                      explained that the Berkeley Partnership have suggested other
                      solutions and proposed that the framework could be structured
                      around the business applications. She would take a further look at
ACTION:               a different approach but thought it would be too radical a change for
Lesley Sewell         the business in one go. However, Lesley Sewell assured the Board
                      that changes could be made to the proposal as it developed and the
                      team would keep an open mind;

                (i)   Les Owen asked if the model had been successfully deployed in
                      other organisations. Lesley Sewell reported that she had visited
                      Rolls Royce who were currently moving to the model. She agreed
ACTION:               to find a business who are already successfully using the SI and
Lesley Sewell         similar structure to benchmark. She would look at retail / services
                      sector as well ;

                (j)   Neil McCausland asked for an explanation of the Financial overview
                      (POL(12)28 APPENDIX 1) and why the costs were so high for
                      13/14 and 14/15. Lesley Sewell explained that the optimised
                      baseline was based on existing contracts including RP I increases
                      and also included the projects involved in business transformation.
                      Neil McCausland chal lenged the additional costs. He agreed the
                      expenditure of £13.38m to implement the programme, but stated
                      that this did not mean he agreed the targets for subsequent years.
                      The Chairman clarified that the Board were not being asked to
ACTION:               approve the IT Budget for subsequent years and asked Lesley
Lesley Sewell         Sewell and Chris Day to provide a breakdown and explanation of
Chris Day             the optimised expected cost scenarios for the Board;

                (k)   the board endorsed the proposed strategy subject to the points
                      made and authorised expenditure of £13.8m for the implementation
                      of the programme.
                                                                                               POL00103334
                                                                                             POL001 03334




                  (a)   Agency
                        Les Owen asked if the business had the necessary skills to assess
                        Subpostmaster business plans submitted for Network
                        Transformation. Kevin Gilliland assured the Board that the
                        business was experienced in these assessments as 10% of
                        branches change every year and the business plans for all these
                        changes were put through a retail assessment and then a financial
                        assessment led by Chris Day's team;

                  (b)   the Chairman emphasised the importance of the selection criteria
                        used to prioritise branches and the need for them to be fairly and
                        robustly applied. Neil McCausland suggested a further criteria to
                        look at the benefit for the Subpostmaster as this could provide
                        advocacy for the change;

                  (c)   Kevin Gilliland explained that most of the negative press for
                        Network Transformation was focused on locals and a previous
                        `down-grading' of service. He reported that ' locals could carry out
                        98% of the core business carried out by the whole Network which
                        would move closer to 100% once a manual solution was in place
                        for business banking;

                  (d)   Crowns
                        The Chairman congratulated Kevin Gilliland on the progress being
                        made. Neil McCausland encouraged the business to push for more
                        trials. Kevin Gill iland explained that the most difficult area of the
                        plan was the staff savings and that achieving the targets would rely
                        on engaging the front line staff. This was why more time had been
                        spent on the initial trial at Birmingham. Some of the staff at this
                        office are now being used as advocates in the next trial offices. The
                        Chairman reiterated that the Board was pleased with what it had
                        seen and understood that cultural change was needed, but
                        encouraged the business to keep pushing for faster deployment.
                        Paula Vennel ls agreed and suggested that six to ten pilots are now
                        needed instead of the couple which are planned;

ACTION            (e)   Neil McCausland asked for a reconciliation between the numbers in
Kevin Gilliland         the paper and the Crown P&L.
Chris Day



                  (a)   Nick Kennett explained the suggested management structure and
                        the importance of the relationship between the financial services
                        representative (FSR) and the branch staff. Neil McCausland asked
                        what incentives would be in place for the FSR. Nick Kennett
                        explained that a qualified FSR would earn circa £25k with an
                        incentive of an additional £10k available if reaching sales targets.
                        Kevin Gilliland reported that the structure of the branch staff
                        incentive was still to be agreed;
                                                                                               POL00103334
                                                                                             POL00103334



                        Post Office Limited — Strictly Confidential


                  (b)   Neil McCausland suggested that the new FSR model be built into
                        the Crown Trial, including branch incentives. Kevin Gilliland
                        accepted this would be a good place to trial new concepts. Nick
                        Kennett reported that the Birmingham trial had already seen an up
ACTION:                 lift in sales which if replicated through the Network would bring a
Kevin Gilliland         £1 m additional profit;

                  (c)   Les Owen asked for clarification as to whether the proposed FSR
                        role could give advice. Nick Kennett confirmed that although the
                        FSR would be qualified they would not give advice but would
                        perform an assisted sale;

                  (d)   Les Owen highlighted the potential opportunity as other financial
                        organisations' advisors move to charging a fee post RDR (Retail

                        given free financial services advice and this presented an
                        opportunity for the Post Office.



                  (a)   The minutes of the meeting of 9th February 2012 were agreed;

                  (b)   the Minutes of the POFS Board Meeting (POFS(12)1st) were noted.

POLB12/32               MATTERS ARISING — Status Report

                  (a)   POLB11/62/(c) Appendix A
                        Les Owen asked for a report of the number of personal injury
ACTION:                 referrals made by Junction. Neil McCausland agreed it would be
Nick Kennett            good to track these especially as they are part of an incentive
                        scheme. Because of her potential conflict of interest on this issue,
                        the Chairman asked Neil McCausland to take ownership of it to
ACTION:                 ensure the business was getting the required information and
Neil McCausland         challenging Junction to ensure that the Post Office was beyond

POLB12/33               MANAGING DIRECTOR'S REPORT

                  (a)   Paula Vennells updated the Board that cheques would now be
                        acceptable at locals' as a new manual process had been agreed;

                  (b)   Paula Vennells told the board about the successful BIS week where
                        500 Senior Civil Servants attended meetings and seminars with the
                        Front Office of Government (FOoG) team with very positive
                        feedback.

POLB12/34               HEALTH AND SAFETY UPDATE

                  (a)   The Health & Safety Update (POLB(12)34) was noted.

               (a)   Chris Day presented the period 10 performance which continued to
                     show strong sales in FS and Mails as well as accelerated spend in
                     key investment expenditure. He also reported that period 11
                     continued the strong performance. The Full Year interim forecast
                     was now £65 - £70m "profit" including the network subsidy payment
                     of £1 80m. Les Owen asked if there was a risk that the Government
                     would reduce the Network Payment because of the good
                     performance. Chris Day reported that this had been a concern
                     especially around cash flow, but was unlikely because the business
                     had already made the case for next year.



               (a)   Nick Kennett gave the Board an oral update on the Eagle
                     negotiations. He explained the problems with the valuation of the
ACTION;              future portfolio which would be sold when the contract expired. Les
Les Owen             Owen suggested an alternative proposal and the Chairman asked
                     that Les Owen and Nick Kennett convene after the meeting to
ACTION:              discuss. Nick Kennett to send a note round to the Board to
Nick Kennett         summarise the discussion;

               (b)   Nick Kennett reported that the Bank had re-opened discussions on
                     FSR numbers, an area which they had previously dropped in the
                     Heads of Terms. The Chairman told Nick Kennett to relay the
ACTION:              Board's disappointment that this issue, which they thought had
Nick Kennett         been settled, was now being re-opened.



                     The Board noted the resignation of Les Owen as Non Executive
                     Director effective 15 March 2012 and the Company Secretary was
                     authorised to file the necessary TM01 form with Companies House.
ACTION:              The Chairman thanked Les Owen for his contribution to the Board.

POLB12/38            BUDGET AND OPERATIONAL PLAN 2012-13

               (a)   Chris Day took the Board through the budget and operating plan.
                     He explained that he had incorporated the feedback from the
                     budget workshop into the adjusted budget figures. He stressed that
                     the business was not building in costs for independence without
                     due scrutiny, but recognised the concern about the existing base
                     costs. He explained that the non-staff costs already included a
                     considerable stretch challenge of £15m unidentified savings and
                     suggested a stretch of £8m in the staff and agents costs to be held
                     centrally as a contingency;

               (b)   Neil McCausland chal lenged the increase in staff costs and Les
                     Owen supported his challenge as the 12/13 staff cost budget was
                     above the strategic plan agreed with SHEX. Chris Day explained
                     that the increase in costs driven by separation had been shared
                     with SHEX who accepted them but obliged the business to find a
                     way to cover the costs. Les Owen suggested that the business
                                                                                             POL00103334
                                                                                           POL001 03334




                       consider using a cost reduction firm to look at the staff costs in the
                       business. The Chairman agreed that the business should look hard
                       at its costs but noted that it would need to balance this work against
                       the importance of delivering Network change and revenue growth;

                 (c)   Chris Day emphasised the need for short term increases in costs
                       but also acknowledged the requirement for an efficiency agenda
                       with forward looking productivity measures. He explained that a
                       company called Vanguard are looking at working practices and re-
                       engineering processes in the Network;

                 (d)   the Chairman suggested that Paula Vennells and Chris Day discuss
                       the medium term cost reduction challenge with the Executive Team
ACTION:                to decide how they will improve productivity without jeopardising the
Paula Vennells         major transformation programmes, and report back to the Board.
Chris Day              Neil McCausland supported this approach;

ACTION;          (e)   Chris Day to circulate to the Board the updated budget figures
Chris Day              including contingency;

                 (f)   the 2012-13 budget was approved.



                 (a)   Chris Day introduced the Pensions paper which had been produced
                       to provide background for the Board. Sarah Hal l and Martin Lacey
                       were on hand to give additional information.

                       The Chairman mentioned the issue of increasing employee
ACTION:                contribution rate and asked Martin Lacey to start a piece of work on
Martin Lacey           what POL's options are re employee contributions.

                       Les Owen asked whether POL intended to take independent advice
                       with regard to the comments made in pare 5.3 as to the legal
ACTION:                standing of the promise — Susan Crichton confirmed that she
Susan Crichton         thought that POL should take independent legal advice.

                       Les Owen also commented on salary sacrifice stating that although
                       this was common in the private sector, it may not be acceptable in
                       the POL context.

                       Chris Day then asked Sarah Hall to outline the increased POL
                       contribution rate. She explained that the RM guidance for this year
                       was that the P&L pension rate should be increased from 17.1 to
                       18.2%. Sarah Hall also mentioned that this flowed through into
                       cash assumptions. This assumed a stable population but the reality
                       might be different. Les Owen asked about the risk that the
                       contribution rate could increase up to as much as 24%. Sarah Hall
                       responded that this would equate to a cash risk of cE9m per annum
                       which should be manageable within the context of POL's cash
                       flows.

                       Following a question with regard to the POL section of the RMPP it
                       was explained that POL would have a separate section of the
                       pension fund but would use the same trustees as RMG until one of
                                                                                             POL00103334
                                                                                           POL001 03334




                       two things happened: either that there was a sale of RMG to the
                       private sector or it became apparent that the strategic objectives of
                       POL and RMG ceased to be aligned. It was concluded that for time
                       being and provided the interests of both companies were aligned
                       and that the RMPP governance arrangement was satisfactory and
                       cost effective.

                       The Chairman mentioned that one of the Non Executives who
                       would shortly be joining the board had a particular interest/expertise
ACTION:                in pension matters so suggested that Chris Day should engage with
Chris Day              her regarding POL's pension issues. The POL Board will avoid
                       taking any unnecessary long-term irrevocable decisions until the
                       new NED has been fully engaged.

                       It was thought that three months would be required to develop the
                       work with respect of risk appetite and looking at the financial impact
ACTION:                of the various options. This work will be deferred unti l the new NED
Susan Crichton         has been fully engaged.

                       There was a brief discussion with regard to the RMSEPP scheme
                       where Les Owen informed the board that RMG is seeking a final
                       legal interpretation of the RMSEPP pension revaluation rule. Martin
                       Lacey outlined a proposal that RM is considering regarding a lump
                       sum contribution to the RMSEPP Trustees in return for certainty of
                       future contributions until March 2018_ POL has the option to
                       participate in this arrangement this year. The Chairman suggested
ACTION:                that the Board were not in a position to make a decision on this
Martin Lacey           proposal and that a paper should be circulated

                       The board agreed to delegate authority to Chris Day as set out in
                       the board paper.



                 (a)   Susan Crichton reported that the European Commission are likely
                       to approve the UK Government's notification that the aid to be given
                       to POL is State Aid in accordance with the EU SGEI Framework on
                       28th March and that SHEX have sent an email expressing comfort
                       that they are confident that this will happen to that timetable. The
                       UK Government's application is going through inter service
                       consultation and no issues have been raised. Chris Day having
                       reviewed POL's financial position was content with the support from
                       SHEX_ The Board took comfort from the assurance and deemed it
                       was not necessary to write to SHEX at this point;

                 (b)   Susan Crichton explained the stages the business needed to
                       complete before separation took place on the 2 Apri l; all the
                       activities were contingent on Royal Mai l Pension Solution State Aid;

                 (c)   Susan Crichton reported that the new POL Articles of Association
                       were not yet finalised as additional tax clarification was required. At
                       the request of the shareholder the Articles are aligned with those of
ACTION:                RM Group, apart from the section on Delegated Authorities where
Chris Day              POL wi ll have to get SHEX approval for spend of over £50m.
Susan Crichton         Susan Crichton and Chris Day were asked to update and circulate a

                                                                                               POL001 03334




                        proposal for Delegated Authorities below SHEX level ;

                  (d)   the Articles also require SHEX sign off of a 5 year roll ing Strategic
                        Plan. Paula Vennells pointed out that the operational intention of
                        the Articles was different to the actual words and wanted comfort
                        that this would not cause problems. Susan Crichton explained that
                        a ways of working document would be put in place between SHEX l
                        BIS and POL with read across for the Articles to ensure they

Susan Crichton/         Crichton and Paula Vennells to come to a working accommodation
Paula Vennells          on this with EIS;

                  (e)   the Board resolved that a sub committee be formed to give effect to
                        the legal requirements necessary for the Transaction to move Post
                        Office Limited to become a sister company of Royal Mail Group

                        Vennells and Chris Day would execute the documents required to
                        give effect to the Transaction including, but not limited to, the
                        secondment termination agreement; the new Articles of the

                        Susan Crichton advised the Board of the need to revise the
                        delegated authority to authenticate the fixing of the Company's seal .

                        The Board approved that the affixing of the company seal may be
                        authenticated by any current Director of the Company or the
                        Company Secretary or Assistant Company Secretary or the

                        The Board noted the appointment of Alice Perkins to the RMH
                        Board;

                        it was noted that Al ice Perkins had notified the Board in accordance
                        with article 89(B) of the Company's Articles of Association that she
                        was proposing to take up a position as a director of Royal Mai l
                        Holdings plc ('RMH") and that this could be regarded as reasonably
                        likely to give rise to a conflict of interest for the purposes of section
                        175 of the Companies Act 2006 (the `'Act"). The Board considered
                        this interest and position and noted the potential for certain
                        situations to give rise to a conflict of interest or conflict of duty. The
                        Board also noted the terms of the Letter Agreement from the
                        Department of Business, Innovation and Skills to Alice Perkins
                        dated 15th March 2012 regarding the structure of the RMH group,
                        corporate governance arrangements and the Crown indemnity in
                        favour of Alice Perkins;

                                                                                             POL001 03334




                       it was resolved that it would promote the success of the Company

                          (a)   Susan Crichton updated the Board on the progress of the UK
                                Government's notification for approval of the proposed state aid to
                                fund the Post Office's transformation programme and network
                                subsidy. She explained that POL's notification is the first to be
                                considered under the European Commissions' new framework for
                                the review of Services of General Economic Interest (SGEI). In this
                                context the Commission is focused on Article 19, which requires
                                that all SGEI contracts are procured in compliance with EU Public
                                Procurement law. The Government has been told that a favourable
                                decision has been drafted but the UK Government are required to
                                provide two undertakings. Firstly, that the re-procurement of the
                                POCA contract would be in compliance with EU public procurement
                                law when it expires. Secondly that the UK authorities will review by
                                the end of 2017 the processes under which all public contracts to
                                provide the SGEIs have been awarded and ensure their compliance
                                with obligations under Union public procurement rules_ The UK
                                authorities' assessment under this review will be made available to
                                the Commission.

                          (b)   Susan Crichton explained that this would mean the MDA would fall
                                within the latter category, and provided that RMG is not privatised
                                by end of 2017 would be one of the contracts reviewed by the UK
                                authorities. It has been suggested that Royal Mail (RM) and the
                                Post Office (POL) should sign a side letter to the MDA to the effect
                                that if, following the review by the UK authorities and discussion
                                with the Commission, the Government request RMG to re-procure
                                the contract and if the Post Office do not win the contract from
                                Royal Mail then the MDA will terminate any claim for loss of
                                earning from POL. Neil McCausland asked that the shareholder
                                should request this on the basis that such undertaking would
                                facilitate in BIS's State Aid notification.

                                The Chairman asked that BiS's advice be captured alongside the
                                                                                              POL00103334
                                                                                            POL001 03334




ACTION:                 side letter for future reference.

Susan Crichton
ACTION:
Paula Vennellsl         The Board agreed to delegate authority to either of the Executives
Chris Day               Directors to sign the side letter.



                  (a)   Matthew Starks took the Board through the proposed LTiP
                        structure. The Board discussed the different measures which could
                        be used and the difficulty of setting the revenue/sales targets so far
                        in advance. Three measures were highlighted as appropriate;
                        absolute profit (deficit reduction); sales revenue; and Network
                        Transformation conversions.

                  (b)   Neil McCausland and the Chairman argued in favour of using deficit
                        reduction rather than profit because they thought the latter was a
                        misleading term given the continuing existence of the NSP.

                  (c)   Neil McCausland proposed that deficit reduction be the only
                        measure in the LTiP_ Chris Day asked if it was right that successful
                        sales and conversion results should get no reward if deficit
                        reduction was missed by a small amount despite the business
                        showing good growth in the year. The Chairman agreed that this
                        could lead the business to drive cost cutting to achieve the budget
                        instead of focusing on growth. Neil McCausland agreed that the
                        three measures were important but still wanted deficit reduction as
                        the prime target.

                  (d)   Chris Day reminded the Board that the business also has a short
                        term bonus scheme which uses profit (deficit reduction) as a
                        primary measure and that he would want to guard against
                        rewarding individuals twice for the same performance.

                  (e)   Paula Vennells and the Chairman stressed the importance of hitting
                        the Network Transformation target as this was agreed with
                        Government as part of the funding and was also a contractual
                        requirement of the MDA and suggested that this could be the
                        gateway measure. This would also help with the transition from the
                        current scheme which includes Network Transformation
                        conversions as a gateway.

                  (f)   The Board discussed the range over which the LTiP would be paid,
                        agreeing that it would pay a relatively small amount for performance
                        marginally below target, the agreed payment if the target was hit
                        and a significantly higher level if a stretch target was achieved.

                  (g)   The Board ga reed that the LTiP scheme should have a gateway of
                        5400 Network Transformation conversions. If this number was not
                        achieved there would be no payment. The LTiP would then be split
                        50:50 between deficit reduction and sales growth. The payouts for
                        these two bonuses would range from slightly below target to a
                        significant stretch target. and it was acknowledged that the two
                                                                                                 POL00103334
                                                                                               POL001 03334




                          scales would need to be different.

ACTION:             (h)   The Board asked Matthew Starks to provide a paper setting out the
Matthew Starks            detail of the Board decision with some worked scenarios using the
                          numbers in the plan as an example to show the LTiP which would
                          be paid for different levels of performance.

                    (i)   The Board agreed the percentage of salary to be used for each
                          category covered by LTiP. Paula Vennells and Chris Day left the
                          meeting and the Chairman and Neil McCausland agreed the
                          differentiation for the CEO and CFO as laid out in the paper to be
                          appropriate.

                    (j)   The company secretary was asked to clarify which roles within the
                          Business require Ministerial authorisation for LTiP and if 'senior
ACTION:                   executives" LTiP should be reviewed by ShEx to fulfil the
Alwen Lyons               requirement in the funding agreement. (See footnote)



                    (a)   There being no other business, the Chairman closed the meeting.

  I   e1iT

      shareholder has confirmed that salary changes including bonus and LTIP for executives
  on the Board - ie CEO and CFO wi ll need Ministerial and Chief Secretary of the Treasury
  approval.

  Under clause 10.1 of the funding agreement ShEx should also have sight of incentives for
  the `senior executives' (defined as the ET) to ensure they are aligned to the Strategic
  Plan. These would not go through the formal Ministerial approval process that applies above.
