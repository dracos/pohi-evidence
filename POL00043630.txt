The minutes of the last meeting were agreed.
2. Letter from JFSA

Alan Bates said that he had written to the Chair to set out JFSA’s concerns about the
Scheme and the Working Group. He had done so for the record. The following points were
made in discussion:

e  itremained JFSA’s view that it was not the role of the Working Group to decide
whether a case was suitable for mediation or not;

e JFSA considered that no further CRRs should be released in draft until Second Sight
had completed their Part Two report;

e although a number of cases made reference to the Part Two report, it was important
that progress continued be made in those cases where Part Two was not relevant;

¢ Post Office confirmed that it fulfilled all its duties relating to prosecutions;

e JFSA felt that insufficient weight was given to wider issues relative to the cause of
losses in branch and where the money went. There were cases in the Scheme
where there was no loss and issues beyond the cause of losses had caused
applicants significant concern;

* mediation would allow for a discussion of those wider issues and concerns,
especially in cases where the data available was limited;

e Post Office had addressed all claims raised by applicants in their investigation
reports;

« Second Sight’s most recent reports had sought to cover the range of issues raised by
applicants and their Part Two report would address a significant number of the issues
raised too; and

« the assessment of cases had highlighted some very common misconceptions on the
part of applicants.

JFSA reported that one applicant had withdrawn from the Scheme owing to Post Office’s
approach to mediation. Post Office said that they could not share details of any mediation
but that no applicant whose case had been recommended for mediation had (thus far)
withdrawn from the process prior to mediation taking place. The Chair said that it was not
possible to evaluate the utility of the mediation process until feedback was received. This
would not be until after 25 cases had passed to mediation and even then, feedback would
be highly generalised.

Action: It was agreed that Second Sight should continue produce draft CRRs and
seek comments within the existing timescales. However, if the final CRR is likely to
make reference to the Part Two report, the CRR should not be released until the
completion of the Part Two report. Second Sight should inform the Secretariat so that
they may inform the applicant of progress with their case.

3. Progress on the Part Two Report

lan Henderson updated the Working Group on progress with finalising the Part Two Report.
Following a discussion with the Secretariat a plan had been drawn up to facilitate the
completion of the report. This contained 3 broad stages:

e The identification of questions that remain to be answered in a more granular form —
by 9 December.
« Post Office to respond - by 6 January.
POL00043630

POL00043630

« A face to face meeting, facilitated by the Secretariat at the beginning of January,
where any necessary clarification of Post Office’s response can be sought.

This was likely to be a complex exercise and there may be further questions that arise during
the process. However, the aim was to produce an evidence based document that facilitated
mediation and closure for applicants. The plan was based on providing a draft version of the
report to the Working Group by the end of February and completion of the report by the end
of March 2015. Belinda Crowe circulated a hard copy of the plan to members of the Working
Group and said that the Secretariat had offered on-going support to Second Sight in order to
meet the timetable set out in the plan.

The Chair said that the plan and final report needed to cover questions that had arisen in the
Working Group’s discussions, specifically:

e the position in Crown Offices
suspense accounts; and
«where there was a loss, who were the most likely beneficiaries.

The Chair asked Second Sight to ensure that their questions were put simply and that their
reports allowed applicants to know where losses were most likely to have gone.

Post Office said that it would be helpful if questions could be categorised by subject and
prioritised to allow cases to proceed through the Scheme. In addition, if Second Sight would
like to work in Post Office’s headquarters for a period of time to aid completion of the report
this could be arranged.

Action: Second Sight to finalise their Part Two report in line with the plan and
timetable circulated to the Working Group; and to address the points made by the
Chair in discussion.

The Secretariat said that there were a growing number of cases that had been considered
by the Working Group but where decisions on suitability had not been reached pending
further information. They recommended that a standard letter be sent to applicants affected
to provide an update on progress. This was agreed.

Action: Secretariat to draft a letter for the Chair to provide an update to applicants
where consideration of their case has been delayed or further information has been
sought.

4.6 Cases where the Working Group has made mediation recommendation

Cases with CEDR awaiting mediation:

M002, M006, M014, M019, M048, M054, M143

Cases where either party have declined to mediate:

M015, M030 (both Post Office)

Cases where WG did not approve mediation:

M057, M076
POL00043630
POL00043630

Cases mediated:

M009, M022, M028, M079, M127, MO66
4.7 Any other queries raised by Applicants / Advisors
Requests for extensions

Extensions had been requested for comments on draft CRRs on M091 and M116
respectively owing to illness. This was agreed.

Action: Secretariat to inform the applicants that their request had been agreed and to
agree a new deadline for comments in each case.

Conditional Leavers Payment

The Chair had received a letter from the applicant's advisor in case M114 objecting to the
condition that they leave the Scheme in order to receive a conditional leavers payment.

Post Office explained that this was in line standard practice and they had modified their
approach to allow the applicant to transfer their branch immediately but have sufficient time
to have their case fully investigated and to make an informed decision on whether they
wished to stay in the stay in the Scheme or take the conditional leavers payment.

The Chair suggested that the two processes ought to be separated, allowing the applicant to
receive their payment and stay in the Scheme. Post Office agreed to this approach.

Action: Post Office to amend their offer to the applicant in case M114.
4.8 AOB
Frequency of Working Group Calls

At the last Working Group call, it had been suggested that calls be moved on to a fortnightly
basis now that the focus has moved on from scheduling. This was agreed.

Action: Secretariat to schedule calls on a fortnightly basis going forward.
M061 & M149

Post Office reported that they had reflected further on the discussion at the last Working
Group and decided that despite being ineligible for the Scheme, cases M061 and M149 may
exceptionally proceed given the issues of eligibility were only spotted after the cases had
made significant progress through the Scheme. The applicants and their advisors have
been informed.

5. Cases for Decision
M003, M005, M013, M018, M021, M039, M063, M078, M126

Post Office reported that they were content to mediate case M126 and that the papers had
been passed to CEDR.

Post Office were similarly content to mediate case M005. However, papers had not been
sent to CEDR as Second Sight had recommended deferring mediation until the Part Two
Report had been finalised. It was suggested that the applicant be informed that their case
POL00043630
POL00043630

was judged as suitable for mediation and that they be given the choice as to whether to
mediate now or wait for the Part Two report. This was agreed.

Post Office were content to treat cases M021 and M078 in the same way as M005.

Action: Secretariat to draft letters to the applicants in cases M005, M021 and M078
informing them that the Working Group had decided that their cases were suitable for
mediation and offering them the choice of mediating now or when the Part Two
Report had been finalised, in the knowledge that this was not likely to be before end
March 2015.

Second Sight asked to revisit the remaining cases in the light of the earlier discussions. This
was agreed.

Action: Second Sight to revisit the CRRs in cases M003, M013, M018, M039 and M063.
Date of Next Meeting

Monday 8th December, Noon.
