RE: Duplication of Transaction Records on ARQ Returns

Graham,
I’m not sure how acceptable the workaround will be to POL.

There is a separate email exchange with Guy who is suggesting we don’t tell POL about the issue until the HNG-X programme (he’s
included Alan and Geoff) have a chance to consider things to ensure it doesn’t impact acceptance next week (see attached email
trail)

Thanks Alan,

Then | suspect neither will get targeted until post R2 as Gareth has identified a workaround | believe.

The fix for PCO200468 is a Audit server application change. Gerald is currently producing a fix to the R1 code, this will
need carrying forward to R2.

PC0194639 will require a change to the workstation applications only. It would also conflict with the R2 version. We have
worked out how to handle this, but | don't think Andy has started any code changes for this as yet (he is on leave at the
moment). If we get the PC0200468 fix in, | think that we can leave this for the time being.

Thanks Andy,

Is this fix on the Audit Workstation ONLY? And does it conflict with any R2 changes for Audit?

If the answers are Yes and No we should be able to push this through for Penny even if Penny has to test it on LST herself?
Alan, Gareth, views?

Graham,
PC0200468

Gerald has prepared and started testing a fix for this problem that will remove the duplicate messages from the Horizon
FUJ00097036
FUJ00097036

transaction data. It should take him about 1 day to complete the testing and handover a new baseline.

(We have seen cases of duplicate message numbers — not duplicate messages themselves — in HNG-X data. These will
not be removed by this fix so there will still be a need for PCO194639 to highlight the duplicates.)

This Peak was proposed for release 01.23 and is currently with RMF for targeting.

PC0194639

This Peak is probably less serious. The information that shows that duplicates have been found in the data is displayed to
the user but may be hard to spot in large output. The purpose of the Peak is to highlight more clearly that duplicates have
been found.

We do not yet have a fix - it will take 2 - 3 man days.

The Peak is currently proposed for release 02.11 and is with RMF for targeting. (We may want to propose/target this for an
earlier release if Penny considers it to be important.)

Hi All,

Do we have fixes for these peaks? If not how long to have them ready; presuming they actually get targeted?

All,

Please see below and attached FYI. | n essence we have a problem with the ARQ extraction tool. Under Horizon this would inhibit the
duplicate transactions held from the Audit Server and thus supply evidence for Court etc without duplicated records.

However the HNGx tool does not and thus duplicate records that can not be differentiated are supplied as evidence. Thus could
allow for legal challenge to the integrity of the system.

Penny,
| will add to CS Prayers but your chances of getting it fixed before R2 is deployed are not good.
Can | suggest that you explain the urgency to Graham and get him to raise it at management prayers?
Can you also add a business impact to the peak using the Impact button?
Adam,
Pleaes can you get your guys to take a look at this and let me know where the fix might be?

Hi Pat

We have a very significant problem which has been recorded in PEAK PC0200468. In a nut shell the HNG-X
application is not removing duplicate transactions (which may have been recorded twice on the Audit Server) and
they are appearing in the ARQ returns. For the old Horizon application Riposte automatically removed duplicate
entries. An initial analysis shows that one third of all ARQ returns (since the new application has been in play)
have duplicated transactions.

Also, we have a PEAK PC0194639 which would highlight any duplication of records (this obviously isn't happening
now).

Kind regards
Penny
