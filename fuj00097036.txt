 Graham,



 There is a separate email exchange with Guy who is suggesting we don't tell POL about the issue until the HNG-X programme (he's
 included Alan and Geoff) have a chance to consider things to ensure it doesn't impact acceptance next week (see attached email
 trail)

              Thanks Alan,

              Then I suspect neither will get targeted until post R2 as Gareth has identified a workaround I believe.

Graham

The fix for PCO200468 is a Audit server application change. Gerald is currently producing a fix to the R1 code, this




                                                                                                                                                     will
need carrying forward to R2.

PCO194639 will require a change to the workstation applications only. It would also conflict with the R2 version. We have
worked out how to handle this, but I don't think Andy has started any code changes for this as yet (he is on leave at the
moment). If we get the PCO200468 fix in, I think that we can leave this for the time being.

Thanks Andy,

Is this fix on the Audit Workstation ONLY? And does it conflict with any R2 changes for Audit?

If the answers are Yes and No we should be able to push this through for Penny even if Penny has to test it on LST herself?

Alan, Gareth, views?

(We have seen cases of duplicate message numbers — not duplicate messages themselves — in HNG-X data. These will
not be removed by this fix so there will still be a need for PCO194639 to highlight the duplicates.)

This Peak was proposed for release 01.23 and is currently with RMF for targeting.




This Peak is probably less serious. The information that shows that duplicates have been found in the data is displayed to
the user but may be hard to spot in large output. The purpose of the Peak is to highlight more clearly that duplicates have
been found.

We do not yet have a fix - it will take 2 - 3 man days.

Subject: PCO200468 - Duplication of Transaction Records

Hi Pat

We have a very significant problem which has been recorded in PEAK PCO200468. In a nut shell the HNG-X
application is not removing duplicate transactions (which may have been recorded twice on the Audit Server) and
they are appearing in the ARQ returns. For the old Horizon application Riposte automatically removed duplicate
entries. An initial analysis shows that one third of all ARQ returns (since the new application has been in play)
have duplicated transactions.

Also, we have a PEAK PCO194639 which would highlight any duplication of records (this obviously isn't happening
now).

Kind regards
Penny
