Dear Richard,
Many thanks for your e-mail.
The draft CRR and CRR Response have been considered in detail by Mr. Simon Clarke of

Counsel who has previously reviewed the Misra case for the purposes of our File Review
Process.
POL00067067
POL00067067

Mr. Clarke has made the following comment:-

“T have considered the M012 CRR and POL’s response thereto. I am not happy with the silence,
both in the CRR and POL’s Response, on the topic of Balancing Transactions.

In the CRR, SS report the Applicant as having asserted that “....figures on the system can be
changed remotely by POL without my knowledge or authority.” Had this issue arisen at trial, and
had the information CK is now possessed of then been known, that material might have been
disclosable to the defendant. That is not to say that the information would have made any difference
to the outcome of the trial, particularly given the then defendant's repeated changes of defence and
admissions to false accounting, but rather the point is that disclosure is never about what effect the
material might have but merely whether or not the material meets the test for disclosure.

Ihave therefore determined that I must consider fully the import of AP’s response to my questions
on the topic of BT’s and advise on the M012 Response in the light of my conclusions on the BT
issue.”

I will revert to you once Mr. Clarke has considered the position further.

Kind regards,

Martin.

POST OFFICE RESPONSE TO CRR ON M012
[TO GO ON POST OFFICE LETTERHEAD]
Second Sight
By email only

[DATE]
Ref: M012

Dear Sirs
Post Office’s Response to Second Sight’s draft Case Review Report on case M012

This letter sets out Post Office’s response to Second Sight’s draft Case Review Report dated 11 April
2015 for application M012 (the CRR).

At the outset, Post Office notes its firm disagreement to the CRR’s conclusion that the case is suitable for
mediation, given the Applicant's conviction for theft and false accounting.

Not only did the Applicant plead guilty to producing false accounts, she was found guilty of theft by a jury
following a contested criminal trial at which she was legally represented. Although the CRR refers to
issues such as the Applicant's suitability for the role and inability to learn the basic skills as matters which
are capable of being addressed at mediation, none of those issues have anything to do with the
Applicant's decision to: a) steal from Post Office; and b) knowingly falsify her accounts to conceal losses.

The appendix to this letter has Post Office's line-by-line comments on the CRR.
Summary

1. As acknowledged by the CRR, there is compelling evidence that the losses incurred at the
Applicant's branch were caused by theft on the part of the Applicant (and potentially her staff).

2. Inthe event that part of the losses were not caused by theft, the CRR accepts that they are likely
to have been caused by operator error.

3. It appears to be accepted by Second Sight (although not expressly) that there was no fault on
the part of Horizon. However reference is made in the CRR to the fact that the expert witness
used by the Applicant to defend her prosecution was unable to rule out errors with Horizon as
one possible explanation for the losses. Since a jury faced with that expert evidence found the
Applicant beyond reasonable doubt to be guilty of theft, the evidence of the Applicant's expert
that suggested Horizon was a potential cause had been considered and dismissed by the jury in
deciding that the Applicant was guilty.

4. The CRR challenges Post Office's appointment of the Applicant on the basis that she was
unsuited to the role and overly dependent on her existing staff. Post Office does not accept that
the Applicant was necessarily unsuited to the role and Post Office took all reasonable steps to
satisfy itself that she was capable of operating as a subpostmaster.

5. In any event, it was the Applicant's responsibility to ensure that she was capable of operating as
a subpostmaster and was capable of taking responsibility and exercising appropriate control over
her employees. Post Office disagrees entirely with any suggestion that subpostmasters are
somehow ‘trapped’ in the role once they have entered into the subpostmaster contract in the way
that the CRR suggests. Any subpostmaster can resign on 3 months’ notice and in exceptional
circumstances Post Office could agree to waive that notice period. Arrangements can be made
for temporary or relief subpostmasters to run the branch whilst a purchaser for the business is
found, thereby enabling the subpostmaster to preserve the value of their investment. There

4A_29482981_1 1
POL00067067
POL00067067

have been a number of cases where subpostmasters have given up the role after discovering
that it was not for them.

Conclusion

Post Office does not consider this case to be at all suitable for mediation for the reasons detailed at the
beginning of this letter.

If you have any questions about this response, please do not hesitate to contact me.
Yours faithfully

Appendix

Line by line comments

Paragraph I Post Office comment

in Draft

CRR

1.5(b) The CQR does not include any complaint regarding: i) transactions seemingly not entered
by the subpostmistress or her staff; iii) power failures; or v) MVLs.

1.5(f) The CQR does not include any specific complaints regarding process issues at the end of
each Trading Period.

1.5(h) Paragraph 1.5(h) of the CRR notes that the Applicant has raised consequential losses
“which may be raised if the case progresses to mediation’, but does not recognise the fact
that the Applicant has by and large failed to quantify the additional sums claimed.

As stated in the CRR, it is outside the scope of the Scheme and Second Sight's role for it
to assess or comment on any consequential losses claimed by an Applicant.

1.7 This paragraph fails to note that the Applicant resigned in April 2008, some months after

her suspension.

3.1-3.13 I Whilst Post Office does not disagree with paragraphs 3.1 — 3.13 as an accurate summary
of the Applicant's position in respect of the points of disagreement, this section of the
report is completely unbalanced as it focuses entirely on the detail of the Applicant's
position and fails to include any level of detail as to Post Office’s position in response to
each issue, save for a broad summary at paragraph 3.13 in which Post Office's overall
conclusion is stated.

Although much of the Applicant's position comprises un-evidenced assertions, the POIR
does respond to each issue raised and Post Office's position in respect of each issue
should be made clear in this section.

45 Although a voucher is mentioned by the trainer, that does not necessarily mean that he
considered at the time that grounds may have existed for Post Office to agree to write off
that loss. In any event, it is clearly recorded that the AIM subsequently made it clear to the
Applicant that a TC would not necessarily be generated and if that was the case, the
Applicant would have to make the shortfall good.

47 Post Office strongly disagrees with the conclusion reached in this paragraph. In keeping
with any business owner, it was the Applicant’s responsibility to ensure that she was fully
conversant with the business she was running, as agent of Post Office. Although
employment law requires staff to be transferred to her employment, at the point that they
became the Applicant's employees she became responsible for their actions. Whilst
incompetent or dishonest staff may well have increased the Applicant's difficulties in
keeping the branch under control, it was nevertheless her duty as employer to be satisfied
that they were competent and trustworthy employees and put effective controls in place.
Ultimately, if any employees acted in breach of the terms of their employment, the
Applicant could have terminated their employment.

48 Post Office disagrees with the implication in this paragraph that little or nothing in the way
of written instructions or other communications regarding balancing procedure was.
provided to the Applicant. The Applicant would have been provided with handouts during
the course of her training both in the classroom and on-site. A comprehensive office
manual would also have been available in branch from the beginning of her tenure.

4A_29482981_1 3
POL00067067
POL00067067

4.9, 4.20 Post Office would question what, if any, weight can be given to the Applicant's expert
witness in circumstances where she lost the case against her and was found guilty of theft
by a jury. Post Office would remind Second Sight that a higher standard of proof is
required in criminal cases than in civil cases, which is all the more reason why that expert
evidence should be disregarded.

The expert's conclusion that a ‘persistent system failure’ was one explanation for the
losses should in any event be disregarded in its entirety as by the expert's own admission
he did not properly scrutinise that claim.

4.10 and Post Office considers that the appointment process and training programme it follows is
4.11 appropriate and compliant with all duties it owes to prospective subpostmasters.
Ultimately the decision to invest in a subpostoffice and become a subpostmaster is a
commercial one. The relationship between Post Office and subpostmaster is a
commercial contract and categorically not an employer / employee relationship.

Post Office entirely disagrees with Second Sight's conclusion that there is “no easy way
out of the job”. The subpostmaster contract gives subpostmasters the option to resign on
3 months’ notice for any reason. Furthermore Post Office would consider each resignation
request on its own merits and may agree to a shorter notice period depending on the
circumstances. Any investment made to buy the property / business is irrelevant to
Second Sight's conclusion as a temporary or relief subpostmaster could be appointed in
the Applicant's place who would assume the Applicant's duties and responsibilities to Post
Office. This happens regularly throughout the network, for example in cases where a
subpostmaster has a long term or terminal illness and has to cease his/her role suddenly.

4.14 Post Office disagrees with the conclusion reached in the final sentence of this paragraph.
It should have been obvious from the very fact that the Applicant was called to an
interview with the Security Team that tighter controls needed to be in place at the branch.
Furthermore, the need for better controls would have been specifically discussed at the
interview and the Applicant would have had the opportunity at that interview to seek
clarification on anything that she did not understand.

4.17 It is not the case that the Applicant would have to fund a shortfall themselves whilst a TC
credit was awaited. All subpostmasters have the option of settling discrepancies centrally
which covers situations where TCs are awaited. This would have been explained to the
Applicant during her training. The premises of the analysis of CRRs in this paragraph is
therefore flawed.

4.21 -4.26 I Under the terms of the subpostmaster contract, it was the Applicant's responsibility, not
Post Office's, to investigate any potential theft on the part of her employees and to raise
any such concems with the Police. The fact that theft was mentioned by Post Office as
one possible explanation for the shortfall discovered at audit should have resulted in the
Applicant taking precipitate action. Single tills were in place by that stage which would
enable the Applicant to detect whether or not theft was taking place and to take whatever
action was necessary to stop it. As noted in the CRR, there is no evidence that the
Applicant made any reports to the Police regarding theft by her employees.

As noted in the POIR, the Applicant's own theft from the branch presents a compelling
reason why she did not pursue suspicions that her staff members were engaged in theft.

4.23, 4.24 I The Applicant's false accounting meant that the branch's cash declarations were incorrect
as more cash was stated to be in the branch than there actually was.

As a result, it was impossible for Post Office, and will have been very difficult if not
impossible for staff in the branch, to have identified the days on which there was a cash
shortfall and / or the amount of the shortfall.

A consequence of not accurately recording a cash shortfall on any given day was to
deprive the Applicant of the ability to immediately review that day's transactions for errors
by branch staff that could have been the cause of the shortfall. Had a review been

4A_29482981_1 4
POL00067067
POL00067067

undertaken on each day where there was a shortage of cash, it is likely that many errors
would have been identified and remedied at the time as the day's trading would have been
fresh in the Applicant's mind.

Put another way, the Applicant's false accounting may have caused potentially remediable
accounting and transaction errors in branch to become actual losses.
