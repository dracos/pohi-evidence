Hi Angus,

CCI no proceedings:

“1. The circumstances of this case do suggest fraudulent activity and money
laundering.

2. It must be acknowledged that there are fundamental problems with proof of a
criminal charge. There appears still to be fatal doubts surrounding the reliability
of the Horizon system which would form the basis of any prosecution. It appears
evidence that the accused did make payments of in excess of £300,000 to the
branch which are unrecorded on this system. It is likely that the picture
presented at any prosecution would be wholly unreliable.

3. The Post Office appear unenthusiastic about the prospect of a prosecution. In
addition over two and a half years have passed since the audit. Although these
factors are not decisive they nonetheless are relevant alongside the issues at
paragraph 2 when considering prosecution in the public interest.

4. Having regard to the issues in this detailed note to Crown Counsel there ought
to be no further proceedings”

thanks,

Mairi
