Dear all, a pretty frantic day for many of us for different reasons. I share this to keep everyone in the loop. And am
grateful to Nina for an excellent summary. We are fortunate to have such an engaged and committed comms team -
they have spent hours ensuring as much misleading coverage as possible was pulled.

I will also send over a summary of Jo Swinson's statement in the HoC. She was good and fielded difficult questions well

for us.

However, the profile is now heightened as a result and we are now carefully considering how we respond.

Any questions, please ask any of the sub-group (Mark, Lesley, Alwen, Susan, Martin E).

Paula
