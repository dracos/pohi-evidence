POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY

FOURTH WITNESS STATEMENT OF SIMON GEOFFREY OLDNALL

ON BEHALF OF POST OFFICE LIMITED IN THE POST OFFICE

HORIZON IT INQUIRY

I, Simon Oldnall, of 100 Wood Street, London, EC2V 7ER, say as follows:

INTRODUCTION

1

I am the Branch Technology Director at Post Office Limited (“Post Office’).
I have been employed by Post Office since September 2020 in this role.
This is my fourth witness statement to the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry
(‘the Inquiry”). In my third witness statement to the Inquiry, I outlined my
career experience and responsibilities as Branch Technology director
[WITN03680300]. In particular, I noted that, in my role as Branch
Technology Director, I am responsible for working with third party suppliers
involved in the Horizon IT system and other related branch technologies
("Horizon"). This includes Fujitsu Services Ltd ("Fujitsu"). In particular I
am responsible for managing the contractual relationship between Post

Office and Fujitsu.

2 The facts in this witness statement are true, complete and accurate to the
best of my knowledge and belief. Where my knowledge and belief, as set
out in this witness statement, has been informed by another person or by
documents, I acknowledge that it has been informed in that manner. I have
been assisted in preparing this witness statement by Burges Salmon and

Fieldfisher ("BSFf"). BSFf is assisting Post Office in the Inquiry.

3 This witness statement has been prepared in response to a request by
email from the Inquiry, dated 4 October 2024, that Post Office provide the
Inquiry with a statement from an appropriate individual to speak to the
contents of a letter from BSFf sent on behalf of Post Office and dated 1
October 2024 regarding the process for and cost of making ARQ requests

to Fujitsu. That letter is [POL00460623] (the “Letter”).

4 As outlined in [POL00460623] at paragraph [1.1] and [1.2], I understand
that the request from the Inquiry relates to Rule 9 (58) question 30(b), which
was addressed in the first witness statement of my colleague Melanie Park
(Central Operations Director) ("Ms Park") [WITN11600100] from

paragraph 160 to 163 and, in particular, paragraph 162.

5 Further, I understand that the Inquiry had asked for the current cost of an
ARQ data request for a 1-month period (in a letter dated 19 August 2024
responding to the draft first witness statement of Ms Park). I understand
that my colleague Ms Park explained that her department has never had a
budget allocated for ARQ requests and that it makes the ARQ requests to

the Security Team.

6 In my role as Branch Technology Director, I am responsible for managing
Post Office's contractual relationship with Fujitsu. As part of that
contractual relationship, Post Office is entitled to make ARQ requests. I
am not involved in the day-to-day practicalities of making individual ARQ
requests to Fujitsu (the process is managed by the Network Crime and
Risk Support Team ("NCRST"), formerly the Security Team), however,
when the NCRST makes ARQ requests to Fujitsu they are exercising Post
Office's rights under the contractual relationship with Fujitsu that I (and my
team) manage. If required I may have input into the processing of an
individual ARQ request (typically if questions arise from the NCRST) and if
significant issues arise with the ARQ request process, or broader decisions
need to be made regarding that process, I am involved in managing the
discussions with Fujitsu. An example of this is the decision by Fujitsu to
reimburse Post Office for previous ARQ request costs (as outline below at

paragraph 10(a)).

7 For those reasons, I assisted BSFf by providing information required for
the Letter which outlines the ARQ request process and the cost of an ARQ
request for a 1-month period [POL00460623]. I also reviewed the Letter
before it was sent and was satisfied that it was accurate. To the extent that
colleagues who work on this process on a day-to-day basis were better
placed to assist BSFf by providing the content required for the Letter, they
have done so but I confirm that the Letter represents my understanding of
the ARQ request process at Post Office to the best of my knowledge and

belief. In accordance with the request from the Inquiry for a statement from

WORK\54246157\v.2 3 65113.3
Classification: Confidential
WITNO03680400
WITN03680400

an appropriate individual to speak to the content of the letter, I set out the

contents of the Letter in this statement.
8 In particular, in relation to the current process for making an ARQ request:

(a) I To make an ARQ request, currently, a requestor must complete an
ARQ form and send it to the NCRST (the template ARQ form has

been produced to the Inquiry as [POL00448281]).

(b) I A member of the NCRST checks that all boxes on the form have
been filled out and submits completed ARQ forms to Fujitsu via
email to process. Fujitsu will securely send the output data to the
NCRST and the NCRST then transfers the data securely onwards

to the requestor.

(c) Fujitsu’s typical response time for an ARQ request is 2-6 weeks.
However, there is a fast-track process for requests from the
Remediation Unit, pursuant to which responses are provided within

two weeks.

(d) As I explained in paragraph 84 of my third witness statement
[WITN03680300], Post Office is currently updating and amending

this process.
9 Further, in relation to the cost of making an ARQ request:

(a) Post Office’s contract with Fujitsu provides for Post Office to make
720 ARQ requests on a rolling annual basis for no additional cost
above the base contract cost. Post Office is only additionally
invoiced for requests above that level.

(c)

WITNO03680400

WITN03680400

Post Office typically uses and exceeds the full annual allowance of
requests for ARQ data. The cost of any ARQ request additional to
the abovementioned annual allowance is £225 (it is a flat fee and
does not vary depending on the period for which data is requested).
Accordingly, the current cost of an ARQ data request for a 1-month

period is £225.

Fujitsu invoices Post Office for additional ARQ requests beyond the
current allowance under the contract and those costs are met by the
cost centre for the Horizon Shortfall Scheme within Post Office’s
Remediation Unit (the additional demand is driven largely by the
Horizon Shortfall Scheme as in order to assess claims Post Office
often requires access to data dating back further than the previous

12 months).

10 For completeness I also note that:

(a)

Fujitsu recently provided a rebate to Post Office for all additional
ARQ requests made between July 2020 and December 2023 in
recognition of those requests having been made to support Post
Office in resolving queries from Postmasters and, going forward,
Fujitsu has told Post Office it will not charge Post Office for any

additional ARQ requests that relate to the Horizon Shortfall Scheme.

It is not necessary for Post Office to make ARQ requests for data
that is 12 months old, or less. I refer to paragraph 161 of the first

witness statement of Ms Park [WITN11600100].

require further information.
