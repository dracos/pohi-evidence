I hope that this is helpful rather than inappropriate â€” I've bashed out a "starter for 10" speaking note for the board next

week.

Feel free to amend, delete or totally disregard as you see fit, but I hope this gives you a flavour of what I think is
needed. If anything, this might too much detail.

One to discuss next week perhaps.
