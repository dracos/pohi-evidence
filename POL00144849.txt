Dear Zubeir

Re Branch Discrepancies — Bowness Road

I am aware that you have communicated previously with our Current
Agents team in relation to 2 unexplained discrepancies that have impacted

your branch. Thanks for alerting us to the issues.

1 | In light of these discrepancies Post Office has thoroughly investigated your

branch's records and, whilst undertaking this investigation, we have
ensured that any known discrepancies have not been charged to your
account. I write now to confirm the outcome of our investigations.
I can confirm that gains totalling £3,186.70 declared at both TP9 in

2 | 2011/12 and 2012/13 were not proper to your branch. This preblem-issue_
was created by a specific set of circumstances dating back to actual losses

3 | cleared bythe former-subpostmasterin 2010 (TP8).

In brief the stock unit that cleared the relevant discrepancy was deleted on
or before 10" December 2010. The related Local Suspense entry should
also have been removed, but this did not happen.

The impact of this was that the loss clearance of 2010 was picked up again
at the beginning of TP9 the next year in Horizon and treated as a gain. At
the end of TP9 the branch was forced to clear this along with current
discrepancies. The Local Suspense ledger in the Post Office Finance
System was impacted in the same way.

This scenario was then repeated at the same point the next year.

Both TP9 discrepancies recorded at your branch were settled centrally at
your branch at the time. Post Office Ltd has settled the gains through pay
and will not be looking to recover these gains.

4 | Changes to Horizon in 2011 prevented this preblentissue for stock units
deleted after mid-December 2010, and the old Local Suspense entry has
now been removed from the system.

Yours sincerely
