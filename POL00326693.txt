Subject: Re: TC and BT and the 42 week issue

Sorry I cannot really comment not having seen the franchise manual.

I am preparing a comms(for the IMPACT team) which Colin Baker asked for at
a recent meeting to share the new DR processes.

This will show the debt recovery process at a lower more detailed level (
including disputes and discrepancies where a TC is due) than the training
manual/ videos etc.

Not sure if this would help you to assess any potential changes required
for your manual.

Let me know if you need a copy.

I would have thought we need to look at the accounting section to ensure

that references are to Branch Trading and not Cash Account.

The franchise agreement can only be changed at renewal stage but would not
need a change anyway as the agreement is very general and indicates that
they have to maintain and operate the accounting system provided by the

Franchisor

However, I would suggest that it is a communications issue; prior to and
at the time of introducing Branch Trading, partners need to be advises
that this is a mandatory change to the branch accounting system provided
by the Franchisor and all instructions should be clear and not open to

interpretation.

Subject: Re: TC and BT and the 42 week issue

The issue is around the branches responsibility to roll branch trading at
the appropriate time. I think we need to be clear that failure to do so
will lead to the corrective action process in the service teams ( where
warnings are given and ultimately suspension).

Is it necessary for a contractual reference or is it sufficient to use
existing processes for managing this non conformance?

Vicky,
Is the contractual issue, what action we take if a sbpmr refuses to make
good a loss? I£ so, under the contract the sbpmr is obliged to make good
losses without delay. However, we may want to make this clearer ie.
demonstrating that we will act responsibly by eg. providing evidence where
applicable; and spelling out that the loss must be made good within x time
period.

Paul will be the main contact from my team for this - with Lesley feeding

in on the franchise contract.

Kevin,

Please see the email below which I have sent to Lynn following a meeting
we had last Wednesday. I think we could do with looking at the contract
situation with Postmasters again once IMPACT has been implemented

especially in relation to my final bullet point which I have highlighted
below. Could you let Jen and I know what you think and we wiull be more
than happy to assist in reframing the contract to reflect the changes in

processes.

Thanks and regards

Vicky

Subject: TC and BT and the 42 week issue
Lynn,

Firstly, thanks for the talk through yesterday. I think it helped to
clarify things in both our minds as well as raise a number of questions

which we need to progress.

The following is an attempt at a "brief" summary of what we agreed in
order to allow us to move forward on the process for when a postmaster
does not roll his BT due to having outstanding TCs which he has an issue

with.

The summary of what we agreed is as follows: (as discussed there will be
some nuances around this)

investigation in P&BA identifies a difference that requires a TC to be
sent to a branch (this has to be done to a standard that allows the branch
to understand the basis for the TC and how to action it appropriately).
Branch receives TC and actions appropriately via the following options
"accept and make good", "request more evidence"(if this option is
available) or "accept and settle centrally".

If the branch does nothing - it may be followed up by P&BA if it is high
value (though this process has yet to be discussed and defined)

Branch has TCs outstanding - (for whatever reason) at the time it is due
to do the BT and therefore does not roll his BT

NBSC identify branches that have not rolled their BT and contacts them ask
why

NBSC contacts P&BA if the reason branch has not rolled is due to
outstanding TC

if it is identified that the branch is querying a TC then it will be
referred to P&BA to resolve and the service line to put them on stand by
if a visit or other action is required

P&BA will investigate and at this point (or at the point when the BT is
due to roll) if there are still TCs outstanding then as a matter of
EXCEPTION only we can agree that the TC is actioned by the "settle
centrally" option with an agreement on how to resolve, and by when, and
the investigations required to agree the final action.

if P&BA cannot resolve and there is still an issue that means the branch
refuses to roll the BT then it has to become a point of escalation to the

service line to action.

I think we need to be clear about a number of points here to provide
direction to our teams on roles/responsibilities and accountabilities so

we don' trip over each other or have gaps:
we do not at this stage know what the Postmaster behaviours are going to
be so it will be difficult to estimate resource required for this

the Service team are responsible for acting as an escalation point only
and NOT to chase up outstanding TCs which are outside of this process -
(this is to free you up to support the Sales teams, and we see this as our
role in support of the Sales teams)

these processes will need to be reviewed in the light of experience post
implementation of IMPACT

that we should set up a joint working party with all key parties from
Service line, NSBC and P&BA to work through the issues arising and make
recommendations for future changes etc., as well as day to day working
that the processes for informing and resolving Service team and P&BA of
issues where branches have not rolled their BT has to be slick (a few days
only) especially during a 5 week period when the BT will be run on day 35
leaving only 7 days till day 42

That we consider in the P&BA processes not to issue TCs in the week in
which a branch is doing its BT (i.e. Mon/Tue/Weds/Thurs)

that we still need to agree what we intend to do if a branch (after

intervention of the Service line) still refuses to accept a TC.

I think this covers everything Lynn, and that we can move forward with
this and get it implemented, understanding that it will most probably need

some refining once we get to using it and have more experience.

Can you confirm to Steve Grayston your acceptance of this so we can close

it as an issue and talk to the NFSP on the lith July.

Thanks and regards
