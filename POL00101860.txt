It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the
doer of deeds could have done them better

The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and
blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort
without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms,
the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph
of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his
place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.

Hi Alice

Thanks for this.

I agree about the disability story. Overall it was balanced and our messages came across. It is very
frustrating that they didn't warn us about when they planned to broadcast (as they had promised to). It
meant we were unable to warn Exco and the Board in advance. We will be taking this up with them.

> On Horizon, it is a fine balance. The team and I have been working pretty much all weekend on the
parliamentary debate and (frankly) duelling with the BBC over their plans for a further round of
broadcasts on Wednesday. A legal letter will go in the morning. Our approach will be to answer any
specific points outside confidentiality - they are very serious (such as alleged failure to follow due
process) so we must. But I so think we need to maintain confidentiality for the Scheme applicants. I

called the BBC editor on Friday to make this point - with every broadcast they are putting a risk in the
way of applicants having their cases heard.

> I am calling my team this afternoon to discuss our next steps and will certainly have your points in
mind, Part of the challenge here is that the BBC are playing games: and it may well be that if we can't
provide a spokesperson they can't broadcast as it would lack balance.

tomorrow. We are working with BIS to understand what it is and how it might impact the Post office

of course with POCA and the CwU strike it is not so much coming in threes as fours and fives!!

>> Hi there,

>> Thanks for your time yesterday.

>> The disability story came over much better at midday - good PO line about listening to our customers.
Also helpful that it was positioned as part of a wider campaign involving other service providers.

>> On Sparrow, the FT piece is obviously unhelpful. It made me think about whether it is in our best
interests to maintain confidentiality. It probably is but if we haven't already, perhaps we should just
ask ourselves that question? As long as we stick by our rules and they don't, we will not be able to
respond to their allegations about the process. On the other hand, it's binary. So if we start to play by
their rules we could find ourselves giving a running commentary about it.

>> My Blackberry has been playing up so I'm not sure if I've missed anything about other coverage
(Sunday) but please don't bother to reply to this if you don't need to.
