1 MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

The Service Review Book this month shows that Fujitsu’s performance across the majority of service level targets has
continued to remain consistent in spite of the continuing challenges of the rollout of both Branch Router and the HNGx
pilot.

Please note also that separate numbers for the Horizon Online targets have been introduced to the Book where
appropriate. In addition, numbers for the remaining targets which can be reported separately are being developed and
should be included from next month.

The Horizon Service Desk received a total of 14,774 inbound calls which is an increase of 550 from January. The
rolling six month average is now at its highest since April 2009. A total of 7% of all incoming calls in February were
from Horizon on-line branches which currently make up just over 1% of the current estate. Currently the main issues
that PMs are logging calls for are being investigated in order to achieve a ratio more closely aligned to that of the
Horizon estate.

The desk has increased headcount to cope with the additional volumes of calls expected and have improved on the
First Time Fix rate, achieving 90.76% for February as opposed to 90.45% in January.

The important indicators of Branch and Counter availability continue to be achieved. In Februray, Branch Availability
was recorded at 99.78% against a 99.33% target and overall Counter availability resulted in an achievement of
99.53% against the 98.92% target.

In February there were no Major Incidents, although there were four service affecting incidents that were within the
Fujitsu domain. Two VIP branches had service affecting incidents - East Ham (194002) and Brighton (261907). There
was one (A&L blank file) incident that was service affecting, however this was outside the Fujitsu domain. Please see
the Incident Management section below for more details.

February was a difficult month for Engineering. The first week was particularly challenging with a high number of calls
carried over for Base Unit faults. This resulted in lower than normal conformance from which we were never in a
position to recover in order to achieve the monthly targets — although the final three weeks were delivered at - or very
close to - the overall monthly targets. However, there has been a steady improvement of between 5%-6% in the
overall numbers compared with the start of the month.

Our conformance against the peripheral A priority SLAs was much more positive, achieving all three major targets: our
best performance since October 2009. It remains a key objective to not only maintain the Engineering Service
throughout the rollout but to also work closely with both our suppliers and Post Office Limited to deliver improvements
where we identify opportunities to do so.

There were no Day J failures in February.

There were 99 incidents in Reconciliation during February, all of which were cleared within the agreed contractual
targets agreed. We have successfully introduced a fix to bulk F99 exceptions which was introduced in two stages.

The Operational Business Change Service (OBC) have now completed a total of 57 Luggable to PHU conversions but
did for the first time see an increase in the number of failures for varying reasons. These failures are described in
Section 5.4 below. Following the problem at the opening of Chesham - a Horizon site — we have since introduced a
manual workaround and are now in the process of introducing an automated fix.

A very successful meeting with the Post Office Live Service Team was held in February. We analysed our end to end
escalation and incident management processes to ensure that they would provide what was required during the main
rollout. We to collectively agreed an approach on how we can ensure that the right level of confidence can be provided
where we are required to act swiftly and professionally in response to an issue at a branch, regardless of where that
escalation has come from. This reduces both duplication and overall response times.

It is one of our combined strengths in service that we are able to work together to deliver improvements even during
the difficult times and this relationship will stand us in good stead along the journey to delivering HNG-X.

2 Incident Overview
Summary: Within the Fujitsu Services domain for February 2010 there were no Major Incidents.
There were 4 service affecting incidents within the Fujitsu domain.

There were 2 incidents affecting VIP sites.

There was 1 (A&L Blank Files) service affecting incident that was outside the Fujitsu
domain.

Major Incident: None

Other incidents inI Thursday 11th February. VSAT Branches over threshold reporting 19 of the 51
Fujitsu Services branches unavailable at 09:03 to 09:29. This incident was due to an issue within the BT
domain: domain, at their base station in Turin. Call 2015192 refers.

Friday 19th February. High call volumes at the HSD, this indicated that there were Debit
Card and E-Top Up transactions failing. Calls started at 12:03. Investigations took place
and DC Agent 4 was identified as requiring a reboot. Reboot took place at 14:20 under
OCP 25641. Authorizations began going through OK and calls to HSD stopped at 15.44
hrs.

Although incoming calls to the HSD had ceased, SSC third line continued investigations.
This was because 25% of DC transactions should have been going through to DC Agent
4, however only 1% was going via this route, the remainder were being shared around the
other 3 DC Agents. SSC and Networks then identified an issue between Correspondence
Server 4 and its dual Correspondence Server 14. This necessitated a Network card to be
replaced on Correspondence Server 14. This full and final resolution occurred overnight
and therefore totally resolved by 08:00 20" Feb. Call 2044831 refers.

Tuesday 23 & Sunday 28" February. There is currently a counter issue in the HNGX
domain (152 Branches) when clerks are scanning and using the F11 button (recalculate)
a zero amount transaction £0 is entered before the correct amount transaction. We have
identified the problem and the fix is in the next release of counter code 25_08 which will
be released in 2 to 3 weeks. We are currently looking at ways to inform clerks of the
actions or to disable the F11 button until the release has been issued to Live. A&L have
assisted us in removing the extra zero transaction to allow the AP file to be processed.
The main PEAK covering this is PC0194848.

VIP sites affected Wednesday 3m February. VIP site East Ham (FAD 194002) Gateway had blue
this month: screened, causing no on-line services. Branch required an engineer to site to replace the
Gateway. Branch services were unavailable from 09:40 to 12:39. Call 1986542 refers.

Friday 12th February. Brighton VIP site FAD 261907 loss of Gateway at 09:28 no
services available. An engineer went to site to replace the gateway, but the unit failed on
fit at 12:00. A second engineer visit was required to replace Gateway. Engineer arrived at
18:10 (Post Master stayed on site) and replaced Gateway and left site re-building
overnight. The CMT and engineer checked the PO was health checking Saturday
morning and Branch was available and working from 08:00 Saturday morning.
Unfortunately the Branch could not open to the Public as the PM had insufficient staff.
Issue escalated to the POSD Duty manager. Call 2019946.

Incidents outside — NB: A working group has been set up with POL, CSC, Logica and Fujitsu, re the issues of
the Fujitsu the delivery of the AP client files regarding delivery times, and issues around empty files.

Domain: CSC have now put in place an automatic email response to Fujitsu which is generated

when an empty file is received and Fujitsu will then automatically resend the file via the
SMC and Unix team, this eliminates the need to involve the Duty Managers from both
POL & Fujitsu.

Week ending 07/02: There was 1 blank A&L file failure during the week and this was
escalated via the new Automatic Process and resent. This has been the only incident of
blank A&L files in the month.

3 Business Continuity

3.1 Business Continuity Testing

No Business Continuity testing was performed in February. Instead the focus was on updating the campus
DR test plan ready for the walkthrough test in March. This included major enhancements relating to POL FS/
SAP.

3.2 Forthcoming Testing

22nd and 23rd March — Business Continuity walkthroughs including IRE11 campus DR and central database
fail-over.
1st April — Loss of STE04 (HSD) walkthrough

The proposal for 2010 Business Continuity testing has been submitted to POL and is pending review.

3.3. Business Continuity Incidents and Issues

On Friday 19” February debit card agent 4 required a reboot to resolve an issue with debit card and E-Top
Up transactions failing. After the transactional issues had been resolved a network card was swapped on
Correspondence Server 14 to return the utilisation of debit card agent 4 back to normal. As a result of this
issue some debit card and E-Top Up transactions failures were seen between 12:03 and 15:44 (as per calls
to HSD). See incidents in section 2 for further information.

4 Complaints

During February, 52 complaints were made to the NBSC about Fujitsu Services. This is 20 complaints more
than received last month. 15 have been categorised as “other” and included “duplicate”, “PM not happy with the
agreed SLA” and complaints against other 3% parties leaving 37 complaints received this month within the
Fujitsu remit: this represents 0.34% of all calls logged at HSD, or 1 in 291 incidents.

Of the 37 complaints, 20 were logged against Engineering; of those 2 were to do with Branch Router install
times being missed. 11 were regarding Equipment failure; no trends were found but the complaints have been
fed back to Repairs for further investigation.

2 complaints were logged against Horizon online sites, both due to screen freezes. We are aware that more
complaints were raised but they did not go through the correct channels. This has been fed back to the
programme teams and processes are being put in place to capture these in the future.

There were also 4 complaints due to no online services and 2 due to HSD call handling.

5 Service Summary
5.1 Horizon Service Desk

HSD had another challenging month receiving a total of 14,774 inbound calls - an increase of 550 calls
compared to January. 1,026 calls were received from Horizon on-line sites. Software and Network call types
increased the most, Software by 354 calls and Network by 142. The increase was seen across all call types
apart from Hardware calls which decreased by 236 on last month.

Service related incidents impacted 11 days in February — the majority of these incidents were reported between
9am-10am, during the peak part of the normal working day. On the 12" February, high call volumes increased
the call duration to 7.31 minutes, due to information being gathered to help resolve the issues being reported.
On the 15th, 248 calls were offered within an hour and a half ; 94 were coded as service unavailable. On the
24th, 130 software calls were logged due to “failing transactions”. 5 days were impacted due to Horizon online
sites receiving error messages on their counters.

HSD has increased its agents by 8 new starters this month to manage the increase of calls received.

FTF is still above target being 90.76% for February. This is a measure on a repeat call for the same site, for the
same piece of equipment having a fault re-logged within 24hours.

5.2 Engineering Service

February was a challenging month for the Engineering Service. We encountered snow and associated weather
conditions throughout much of the UK, which caused hazardous driving conditions for engineers trying to reach
sites, as well as an issue building base units at the beginning of the month.

We entered the month with approximately 40 Base Unit issues at which we were unable to build new counters.
Attending these sites would have meant that the engineers were held on site with nothing to do until the issue
was resolved; because of this, engineers were advised not to attend until a fix had been declared. This led to a
high level of SLT failure, as by the time a fix was declared and engineers had attended sites, SLTs had already
been surpassed. Once these calls had been resolved, the focus around Base Unit calls was then moved to
delivering the rest of the month successfully in order to recover SLTs and provide good service to Post Masters.
During the latter three weeks of the month, we were able to recover between 5.5 and 6% on each of the SLTs.
for 3 hour response, 6 hour incident to fix and 8 hour end to end fix, and 9.5% on the 3 hour subsequent
response target. Whilst the performance achieved was not at the SLT, the level of recovery managed during a
difficult month from a challenging starting position was admirable and reflects the hard work put in by the HSD
and Engineering teams.

The Peripheral SLTs for 3 hour on site response, 4 hour end to end fix and 8 hour end to end fix were all
achieved. One out of 5 subsequent response calls failed the SLT, due to the fact that the call in question was at
a site which took longer than the SLT time to reach but is not classed as remote, meaning that we achieved
80% against this target.

C priority SLT achievement was lower than recent months; this was again due to the difficulties experienced
with base unit builds and reaching sites through deep snow. Force Majeur was not claimed for a number of calls
due to the fact that they were not updated in a sufficiently timely fashion; the teams involved have had this fed
back to them and processes have been put in place to ensure that timely updates are provided in future in order
to keep PMs as up to date as possible.

The volume of screen and PSU incidents logged returned to normal levels during February, largely due to the
fact that despite the snow, the weather wasn't particularly cold. A high number of PinPad incidents were logged,
partly due to a bad batch of PinPads released into the spares loop at the end of January. Some of these
PinPads failed on fit, and some were early life failures: as soon as the problem was recognised they were
recalled. The increase in calls related to Other Items is due to the fact that the Branch Router is currently
included in the total, and BAU engineering have attended some sites in order to reprovision routers and ensure
the maximum effectiveness of the equipment is reached. This part will be split out on the next month's report.
PHU calls are described below.

Details of PHU 1.5 Repairs

The number of calls logged by PHU branches in February saw an increase of 38 from 136 in January to 174.
When compared with previous months figures the ratio of calls logged to PHUs in the estate has remained
consistent. The luggable to PHU conversion programme means there are now 16 more PHUs in the estate
making a total of 319, leaving a total of 120 sites that still require the upgrade to a PHU 1.5.

We had anticipated an increase in calls during the luggable to PHU conversion given that PMs are using an
entirely new piece of kit; and the HSD received seen calls from PMs who require further advice and guidance on
the set up and connection of the kit following the install. To reduce the level of these calls in future and ensure
the PMs know the correct procedure we are currently working with POL to produce a laminate which as well as
providing the correct numbers to call and Branch code to log calls under. The laminate will also feature hints and
tips for resolving common faults and ways to prevent them, as well as information on the store and serve
addresses and access times for these sites. This address and access time information will enable us to keep up
to date on PMs serving patterns, in order for HSD to reduce call duration and prevent repetition and confusion.

Work with Repairs on the problems experienced with hard drives is encouraging and has meant that we now
have a better understanding of possible causes of failure as well as a proven link to incorrect power-offs. We are
now working closely with Geller in order to provide a resolution going forward.

Investigating a correlation between the number of PHU movements and calls logged has identified a number of
branches that regularly log a more than average number of hardware calls and by arranging for senior
engineers to proactively attend these sites we hope to reduce the calls logged at these sites.

During January, 961 network calls were completed by HSD (a 761 decrease from the previous month. 97% of
these were resolved within 4 hours against the 95% target and 98% resolved within 6 hours against the 100%

target.

The following table is a summary of the Weekly Dashboard in January:

Those branches that were solid down for more than 6 days:

Burwick Post Office

The antenna at this VSAT branch had become damaged in the extreme weather conditions. BT were unable to

attend sooner due to the weather causing issues with travelling across to Orkney.

Hindringham SAS

The branch did not have sufficient coverage for a GSM modem and no PSTN line was available fora PSTN
modem solution. An engineer was initially sent to swap the kit however this was unsuccessful; a fault was then
raised with Cable & Wireless when it was found that the line had an issue. C&W sent BT to the exchange to fix

the fault. Once this fault was fixed, the engineer was re-sent to swap the kit and this resolved the issue.
Feedback has been given to CMT as to how this could have been resolved more quickly.

Old Alresford SAS

The kit was eventually swapped at this branch following several unsuccessful attempts; there was insufficient

GSM signal for the branch to trade on this backup solution.

COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE

The average age of solid down has been a little higher than usual due to the issue at Welling Post Office proving
to be difficult to trace. The branch is currently trading out of a portakabin in a Morrison's car park with the wrong
BT line, the correct BT line is currently inside the Morrison's building. POL are currently having difficulties in
getting BT to move the line and this is currently being escalated.

As reported in last month’s SRB, CMT are now posting out GSM modems to branches with agreement with the
Postmaster that they can install themselves. During February, 13 were sent out and only 2 branches required a
follow-up visit from an engineer to assist. This activity allows the engineering resource to be available for other
calls they have for Post Office branches.

CMT have taken on a new process where they remove CLI (Caller Line Identification) from the Post Office line
when a branch router is either being installed or re-provisioned. CLI is found on occasion and prevents the
branch router from being installed/re-provisioned; CMT in the past would ask a 3” party within Fujitsu to do this,
however taking on this process makes the branch router quicker to install.

5.3.2 Central Network Service

Fujitsu Central Network
There were no Service Affecting faults within the Central Network raised during February.

None Service Affecting Faults.

On the 12" February, there was a fibre connection break on one of the major connections provided by Cable
and Wireless which supports test and support functions from Bracknell. As part of the circuit infrastructure all
traffic should failover to a secondary route. Due to a configuration error on the Routing not all of the network
traffic was being diverted correctly and we experienced loss of connection. Service was restored to all following
a configuration change on the Routing (a2" February) and C&W resolved the fibre fault on 13" February. Live
Service was not affected by this fault.

On the 21% February, we were advised of a connection failure on one of the two circuits to the Northern Data
Centre (Huthwaite). As part of the investigation we were informed that there had been a flood and one of the
Cable and Wireless Customer Edge Routers had sustained water damage. This incident was reported to C&W
who attended site on the 22” and resolved the failure by replacing the Router. Service was not affected as
there is a secondary circuit which is used for resilience.

BT VSAT Se:
During February there were no major network faults affecting the VSAT service.

Cable and Wireless ISDN Service
During February there were no reported incidents affecting this service within the Cable and Wireless domain.

BT/Core ISP ADSL Service
During February there have been no issues affecting the central DSL or ADSL network.

Summary and Management Information
BT has continued to progress 21CN across the Branch Infrastructure which has not resulted in additional faults

being reported.

The RMGA network team are still working closely with the project team to ensure seamless transition into HNG-
x and are still involved in validating and testing, plus physical and logical connections of the infrastructure,
including Branch Router and WWAN. The network team are also involved in validating and negotiating the
decommissioning of service out of the Wigan and Bootle data centres.

Project Acti

We are working with C&W, CSC and Post Office to deliver the upgraded circuits into the NDC and Sungard, and
expect completion by end of March.

We are also working with a project team to deliver a solution for Bio-Metric data carrier services from the Branch
over to a Cogent data centre.

All SLTs were achieved in February.

499614 — Pensarn. — Discovery of Asbestos delayed the project.

Information & Actions

PSTN line faults aren't generally determinable ahead of configuration although we do already employ a process
which whoosh tests the service on the line and this will always capture any obvious fault prior to our attendance
so that it can be rectified in time.

Errors in the VPN feeds for Greenfield Openings is a new complication. Root cause analysis has been carried
out and a fix identified which can be manually deployed if further instances occur. An automated fix is also in

construction.

The Luggable to PHU1.5 exchange programme continues and up to week ending 26" February 57 sites in total

have been converted.

5.5 Service Integration Service

5.5.1 Post Shops

All Geller Tills have been removed from Post Offices.

5.6 Data Centre Operations Service / Data File Transfer

5.6.1 Day J Failures

There were no Day J failures in February.

5.6.2 Reconciliation Service

99 reconciliation incidents were cleared during February. This is 24 fewer than reported in January.

There were 28 priority incidents cleared within the 8 hour SLT. Of the remaining 71 incidents, all 71 were
cleared within the 5 day SLT.

Reconciliation issues in February

There are a small number of branches that are not rolling over their stock units within the 42 day period. With
the support of the NBSC, these branches are being contacted and roll over shortly after. The number of non-
rolled branches has decreased again in February.

The failure of the delivery of the Streamline file on the 29/01/2010 caused circa 40,000 error messages on the
Streamline Reconciliation report. A call was sent to Development to write a script to bulk F99 the exceptions,
which was successfully run in two stages, one on the 12/02/2010 and the other on the 17/02/2010.

There were around 15,000 State E11 exceptions on the Network Banking reports from the 19/02/2010. A call
has been sent to Development to write a script to bulk F99 the exceptions, and Development are still
investigating the root cause of these exceptions.

There has been a large increase in the number of State 4 exceptions on the Network Banking reports, for both
Horizon and HNGx branches. These transactions are not completing and P&BA are authorising MSU to set
these transactions to F99, as well as having to manually reconcile the customer accounts, as the accounts are
being incorrectly debited/credited. A call is currently with Development to work on a fix to reduce the number of
these exceptions.

5.6.3 Transaction Corrections Delivered to Branch

Delays with the overnight scheduler are resulting in corrections files being delivered the next day. This is
affecting the SLT performance and is being investigated.
