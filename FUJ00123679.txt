Jon, thank you for sending through Andrew Bayfield's witness statement from Misra. It's very helpful.

I attach the key witness statements from Castleton which address a number of the questions Shoosmiths have
raised. Please can you have someone (in P&BA?) confirm that the contents of these statements are still accurate,
and, if not, how things have changed.

With many thanks.

Kind regards
Helen
