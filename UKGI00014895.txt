Subject: RE: REGINA v SEEMA MISRA - CRM/258932/JSX GUILDFORD.
CROWN COURT MENTION - 1ST FEBRUARY 2010

03/02/2010 23:41

Dear Sirs,
R V Misra

We refer to HHJ Critchlow's order on 01/02/10 to serve a further disclosure
request by 4pm today.

Due to an office system failure causing our email and case management to go
down, we contacted the court who, effectively, gave us an extension of time
until midnight tonight. This extension was communicated by defence counsel
to prosecution counsel earlier this evening.

We now enclose our third request for disclosure together with our expert's
third interim report.

We note that your response of 27/01/10 makes suggestion that our Expert
meets with your investigating officer and representatives of Fujitsu. Can
we endorse that and emphasise that,we have, since July last year, been
requesting that our expert has access to data records, a request that has
been repeatedly rebuffed on grounds of cost and work involved.

You have indicated that you do not propose to rely on an expert but on the
employees of Fujitsu. For the first time, at the hearing on 01/02/10, you
identified that witness as an employee named Jenkins. However, not only
have you not served his evidence prior to suggesting a meeting, you accept
that you haven't even yet taken a statement.

We very much doubt that our expert will now be able to carry out the
testing required and then report in time for the trial. However this is
dependant on further disclosure and possible discussions between experts.
If we cannot prepare the report we will, in these circumstances, as already
notified to the court on 01/02/10, seek to make application for the
indictment/count to be stayed for abuse of process.

Even if we our ready for trial, we would point out that our expert has now
provided three interim reports which would have been avoided had you
provided us with access to the data records as first raised in July last
year. In addition we have also had an aborted s8 hearing on 20/11/09/ a
mention hearing on 01/02/10 through lack of disclosure and the production
of a third request of disclosure tonight, much of which is requesting that
you comply with the requests raised in our document of 30/11/09.

We put you on notice that we will, in any event, be applying for wasted
costs against the Post Office for the work involved by Counsel, Expert and
ourselves in the above hearings, reports and requests.

As you can see, we have copied this message to both Prosecution and Defence
Counsel and have faxed this message together with enclosures to the Court.

Yours faithfully
