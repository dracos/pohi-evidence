Thanks Tom.

In short the BBC are effectively accusing us of:

- breaching PACE
- wilfully allowing miscarriages of justice

Surely this falls into defamation territory? It smacks of the worst kind of journalism: get a taking head to say
something with no evidence, we reject it, they broadcast both sides and yet the damage to us as a party is
significant.

Grateful for urgent advice.

Hi Tom

Thanks for this.

I have made a few changes in the attached. If you and copied colleagues are content, I am and would
like it to go asap.

On the wider defamation point: my concern is that the BBC suggests in its programme, without
evidence, that we do not follow legal procedures correctly. This strikes me as a very serious allegation,
which would have the potential to lower our reputation with third parties, unfairly. I am not, however,
up to date with media law developments.

Perhaps it is an issue for a separate communication to the BBC as a warning shot?

Dear Mark

Susan is away from the office today so she has asked me to send this out. However we
have been in close touch with her by phone and email this morning and had her input on
this letter.

With regard to the implications of the BBC making these allegations, the recent change in
law has made it much more challenging for a business to succeed in a defamation action.
In particular, it can be difficult to show the serious financial harm that is required. This
letter therefore does not refer expressly to defamation, and instead emphasises concepts
from the BBC editorial guidelines such as the right to reply and a fair and appropriate
deadline for a response. However, do let us know if you would like us to consider this
further.

Kind regards

HI Susan

I'm sending you below the long email chain I have had with the BBC over the weekend. As
discussed we would now like to send a legal letter citing Ofcom guidelines. I think we are in a
very reasonable position.

Given the questions posed by the BBC (which are at the end of this letter) I would very much
welcome your view also as to the implications of the BBC making these allegations - my own
media law view is that they are stepping into dangerous territory if some of these allegations are
made.

Subje ost Office interview

Hi Ingrid
Iam aware of the complexities of making a programme. I remain perplexed,

however, as to why you require a further 2.5 days after today to do so and are not
prepared to incorporate a Post Office interview in that time.

POL00150242

Our spokesperson, as I have said, is involved in Mediation Scheme work all day
today and tomorrow. I am not prepared to jeopardise that work to accommodate

Dear Mark,

lam sure you are aware that making a programme involves far more than
merely filming. As I have said it is not practically possible for the team to
accommodate an interview after today.

As you maintain your designated interviewee cannot possibly accommodate
an interview at any point today — despite our offer to be available either
before or after their normal working day (though the former is clearly now
redundant) then we too are in a difficult position.

If this person is the only person within the Post Office who is appropriate for
interview, then I’d be grateful if you could ask them to consider being

interviewed at the end of their working day today.

Failing that, then as I’ve said, we will fairly reflect the post office’s position
within the film whether or not you are on the sofa.

Regards

Ingrid

Dear Ingrid
You have singularly failed to set out why you need two full days to

prepare your film and why the interview you requested must happen
today. This is not reasonable.

POL00150242
POL00150242
We stand ready to take part yet you refuse to budge from a self imposed
deadline and are unable to explain why you require more than 48 hours
to prepare a film, having presumably shot most of it, including several
interviews designed to traduce the Post Office's position. I note from his
Twitter feed that Nick was filming for 10 hours on Thursday.

While we would like to appear in your film we reserve the right to
ensure that, given the range of issues you are raising, we make the most
suitable person available. She is not available today due to work on the
Scheme. I am therefore stuck - do I place the Scheme and the interests
of applicants ahead of your request? The answer here is obvious.

We will send you a statement and a very full document setting out the
answers to the questions posed by Mr Wallis. I would request that given
your refusal to accommodate a full and proper Post Office interview the
statement is used in full.

We did indeed suggest that we have a slot on your sofa. I didn't imagine
for a moment this would mean a scenario where our points would not be
reflected through interview in your film. It provides no real opportunity
for the Post Office to respond to the serious and unfounded allegations
you plan to make.

Hi Ingrid

Thanks for this. I am struggling to understand
why it "needs" to be on Monday, particularly
as, for the reasons set out in my earlier emails,
we are unable to provide a suitable
spokesperson on Monday due to competing
business priorities related to the Scheme and
applicants. It would be ironic indeed if we were
to relegate these responsibilities.

As I've also said, and as Nick has
acknowledged, your sofa slot will not provide a
suitable forum for the Post Office to respond to
the very serious and unfounded allegations you
plan to make in what will now inevitably be a
film which does not present a full and rounded
picture. It would be extremely unfair to suggest
as you do now that a minute or two in the
studio will provide suitable opportunity for the
Post Office's position to be fairly reflected.

Given the circumstances therefore we could not
appear in the studio.

Task you again to please reconsider your
refusal to accept a Post Office spokesperson
for your film on a more reasonable deadline.

Many thanks

Mark

Dear Mark,

As I've said if you or a colleague
wish to be interviewed for the film
then it needs to be on Monday.
You may feel late Tuesday is
reasonable but as i've made plain
from the outset, beyond Monday is
not possible for us. As i've also
said any monday interview can be
as early or as late as you wish.
Should neither you nor your
colleague be available for a filmed
interview tomorrow then we are
content with a statement for the
film as we had last week. As things
stand, you yourself will be on the
sofa on wednesday and able to
reflect the Post Office's position.

Hi Ingrid

It isn't about your

disappointing us at all,
it is about our

to provide an

reasonable timescale.

It is a little baffling
that you are not
prepared to allow us
reasonable time to
respond with an

to offer an interview

Tam sure it is

Without Post Office
input by interview into
the film and the

detailed points and
allegations made it
will clearly be
impossible, as Nick
has accepted, to
respond fully in the
studio in a two or
three minute slot. I do
not think in those
circumstances we
could appear in the
studio: the film will be
very skewed without
our voice in it.

Given the work my
colleague must
undertake on behalf of
the Scheme and
applicants this week, I
will have to check
with her, but I think it
might be possible to
conduct an interview
in the late afternoon
on Tuesday.

I think she will be out

sure this can be
overcome. Do let me

would be suitable and
I will confirm a

Hi Ingrid

That is very disappointing. To stress we would like to
offer a spokesperson for your programme's pre-
recorded film and are able to but not in the timetable
you suggest.

Our position is very reasonable. I assume the
programme will return after Christmas. What is the
urgent reason for being unable to give us the time we
need?

You plan to make a series of complex and very serious
allegations about Post Office Ltd, all of which can be
answered in detail. I do not understand why your
timescales are such that you cannot accommodate an
interview for a film 24 hours before broadcast. You are
asking for 48 hours for your own internal processes.

Nick has himself suggested that a sofa slot would not
really give us the opportunity to answer the very
complex range of allegations he is making. We agree
and clearly would be unable to take part in the studio if
our position is not reflected in the pre-recorded film.

It cannot be fair to feature a series of other interviews
in the film, all of which were presumably filmed last
week in good time for your deadlines, without giving
Post Office, which is very firm in its position, the
opportunity to respond. There are two sides to every
story, as you know.

In that case please can I formally request

is no urgency or need to broadcast this
item on Wednesday, especially as the
Mediation Scheme is continuing. Due to

Many thanks for your email.

As you will appreciate you
have raised a broad range of
issues which range across
legal, IT and network
support. We are very keen to
be able to respond to all these
issues in detail, particularly as

POL00150242
POL00150242
there are some really
fundamental points raised in
your questions.

To that end we are working
to ensure that we can provide
you with the best possible
response. As mentioned in my
previous email, as well as
input from the suppliers of
our IT system and a legal
view on the serious points
you raise, we need (and I
think this is reasonable) to
provide you with a
spokesperson who can speak
across this range of issues.

We are dealing however on
Monday and Tuesday with
mediation scheme matters
which relate to applicants. So
we can absolutely be available
later on Tuesday or on
Wednesday morning.

I do appreciate the challenges
you have around filming and
editing of course but I am
sure you will appreciate the
challenges from our side as
well.

I suggest we speak first thing
Monday morning and
hopefully you will be able to
come back to me on the
timescale above and I will be
able to update you too on
where we are - please be
assured we will do everything
we can to ensure we give you
the opportunity to interview
the Post Office on these
important matters.

Hi Mark

Thanks for your email. I
am delighted you are
inclined to offer studio
live and pre-recorded
filmed interviews.

As Ingrid (cc'd) has
confirmed the planned
transmission date for
both would be Wed 17
Dec, to coincide with the
planned Westminster Hall
adjournment debate on
the Post Office called by
James Arbuthnot MP.

As Jane (cc'd) explained
to you on the phone and
as I am sure you
understand, we need to
set a time for the pre-
recorded interview well in
advance of the planned
transmission date as the
interview will have to be
edited and go through all
the usual processes
before being delivered to
the One Show for
broadcast. It is in no
one's interest to rush
this.

As Ingrid may have
mentioned (and I defer
to her on exactly how
things may be happening
on Wednesday), any
studio guest you
nominate will most likely
be allotted around three
minutes interview time,
but with Victoria Wood,
Michael Ball, a children's
choir already booked on
Wednesday and the
unpredictability of a live

POL00150242
POL00150242
studio environment, the
interview might get
curtailed, or the
discussion itself might
veer off topic, despite
everyone's best efforts.

Could I therefore urge
you to fix up a date and
time as soon as possible
to film a pre-recorded
interview where we can
ask you, and give you
the opportunity to
answer, a series of
questions on the subjects
raised below in a calm
and controlled
environment.

The interview will, of
course, be edited, but we
will be scrupulous in our
duty of fairness towards
the interviewee and the
answers they give.
Furthermore, whether
either, both or no
proposed interviews end
up being broadcast, we
will be taking all
reasonable steps to
ensure the Post Office's
perspective on the
serious matters below is
properly represented.

T hope all that makes
sense. Just to ensure you
are clear on the internal
division of labour
surrounding the two
proposed interview
opportunities, Ingrid will
deal with you re the
arrangements re the
possible live interview on
the One Show sofa,
whilst Jane and I can
work with you to arrange
a pre-recorded interview
at a location of your
convenience.

T hope to hear from you
soon re a proposed pre-
recorded interview
location/date/time and
interviewee. I am happy

that the

would

the
Opportunit

and in the

the very
serious and
detailed
allegations
being
made in
the email
we
received
from Nick
Wallis
(copied
below for
ease of
reference).

I

from

evening.
This
comes as a
surprise as

POL00150242
POL00150242
you

Either
way, given
the very

the
requiremen
t to give us
reasonable
time to
respond,
we do not
believe we
can meet
your

of noon on

Monday
for an
interview
to be
conducted.

We are
inclined to
offer an
interview
but our
spokespers
on, who is

ons
process on
the matters
you

is involved
in

scheme

and
Tuesday.
Tam sure
you will

She could

as she is

knowledge
of the
specifics N
ick has

to. I would
also stress
again,
however,
that Post
Office
cannot
comment
on
individual
cases.

The
Ofcom
guidelines
on matters
like this
make clear
that we
should be
given
reasonable
time to
consider
and make
our
response
to requests
such as
this. What
constitutes
a
reasonable
time must

POL00150242

into

There is no

in the light
of your

and the
ongoing
nature of
the
mediation
scheme,
not to
mention
the point I
raised on
the phone
about
potential
compromis
e of cases
going

the
scheme.
Given that

Dear

1) Thank
you for
your help
with The
One Show
item
transmitted
on
Tuesday
9thDecem
ber. We
are now
preparing a
second
film which
is due to
go out on
The One
Show on
BBC] at
around the
same time
next week.
We would
be most

POL00150242
POL00150242
grateful if
the Post
Office
would be
prepared
to offer an
interview
expressing
its point of
view in the
continuing
dispute
with some
Subpostma
sters over
Horizon
and
associated
issues.
This would
need to be
recorded

by noon on

Monday b
ut we
would be
able to
meet you
at your
location of
choice and
we can do
it over the
weekend if
that is the
only
option.

2) The film
we are
broadcasti
ng once
again
refers to
concerns
over
Horizon.
This time
it features
the story
of Steve
Phillips

POL00150242
POL00150242
from
Nelson in
South
Wales who
is having
problems
with the
system, as
well as
interviews
from a
group of
former
subpostma
sters
including
Noel
Thomas,
Jo
Hamilton,
Julian
Wilson,
who say
they felt
under
pressure to
sign off
incorrect
accounts
even
though
they did
not
understand
how sums
could be
missing.

Mr Phillips
says he
and other
Subpostma
sters live in
fear of
being told
to pay
back losses
neither you
or they can
explain,
and he
adds that

POL00150242
POL00150242
he and
other
Subpostma
sters do
not trust
Horizon.
This latter
point of
trust in
Horizon by
Subpostma
sters is one
which has
come up
many times
with other
former
Subpostma
sters we
have
spoken to.

3) In our
film former
Postmaster
S say it is
difficult to
investigate
the causes
of
shortfalls
for which
they are
held liable,
because of
the way
Horizon
and
associated
POL
processes
and policy
function.
They say
in order to
open for
business
the day
after the
close of a
trading
period they

POL00150242
POL00150242
had to
agree to
pay back
alleged
shortfalls
(either by
settling to
cash or
settling
centrally,
which
implies
payment
later).
They say
this put
them in a
very
difficult
position.

4) We ask
one former
Subpostma
ster why
she
pleaded
guilty to
false
accounting
in court
when she
believed
herself to
be
innocent.
She tell us
she felt she
couldn’t
defend
herself
because
she didn’t
have
proper
records,
that the
Post Office
had taken
some
potentially
useful

POL00150242
POL00150242
items and
paperwork
away
during
their
investigati
on and she
felt she
would be
prosecuted
for theft as
well as
false
accounting
if she had
not
pleaded
guilty to
the latter.

5) We
understand
from the
Subpostma
ster
contract
and from
speaking
to former
Subpostma
sters who
have been
through
the process
that
Subpostma
sters are
not
allowed a
legal
representat
ive when
they are
interviewe
d under
caution by
Post Office
investigato
rs. Instead
they are
allowed
one

POL00150242
POL00150242
companion
who must
be a Post
Office
employee,
who is not
allowed to
speak.
Does this
still
happen? If
so, why
does the
Post Office
think it is
fair? Also,
we are
aware that
Post Office
conducts
PACE
interviews
at which
Subpostma
sters are
allowed
legal
representat
ion. Could
you
explain in
what
circumstan
ces you
think it
appropriat
eto
interview
someone
under
caution but
with legal
representat
ion, and
why this is
not
available
to
Subpostma
sters in the
interviews
which

POL00150242
POL00150242
usually
precede
them?

6) We
would also
like to put
to you
some
opinion
about the
Post
Office’s
approach
to
investigati
ng and
prosecutin
g
subpostma
sters. We
are in
possession
of expert
opinion
from a
professor
in criminal
justice
which
implies the
Post
Office’s
dual
function as
investigato
rand
prosecutor
, and its
300 year
cultural
history of
using it
against its
agents is
unique.
That’s not
to say he
thinks you
are the
only
organisatio

POL00150242
POL00150242
n with
prosecutin
g powers,
but that
you have a
unique
culture of
prosecutin
g your
agents. He
implies this
approach
lacks the
checks and
balances of
a typical
prosecutio
n by the
CPS. In his
opinion
this creates
a situation
where
miscarriag
es of
justice are
more likely
to occur.

The Post
Office has
assured us
ina
Freedom
of
Informatio
n Act
request
that it uses
the Crown
Code for
Prosecutor
s. Can you
please
explain
how this
code was
applied in
the
following
cases:
Jackie

POL00150242
POL00150242
McDonald,
Damian
Owen and
Tom
Brown. In
these cases
the Post
Office
pursued its
own
prosecutio
n despite
no
prosecutio
n having
been
brought by
the CPS
after police
investigati
ons. If you
are unable
to unable
to
comment
on
individual
cases,
please
comment
on cases
like this in
general.

7) There is
also a
point
raised by
Geoffrey
Sturgess, a
business
contract
expert. He
believes
Subpostma
sters
should be
told about
the history
of known
problems
with

POL00150242
POL00150242
Horizon
(such as
the
Calender
Square
issue and
others
raised in
Second
Sight’s
Interim
Report)
which have
led to
shortfalls
in
Subpostma
ster
accounts
and the
history of
other
allegations
against
Horizon
before they
are
allowed to
sign the
Subpostma
ster
contract.

8) We will
also
include
opinion
from
Sandip
Patel QC
who
specialises
in areas
including
business
fraud and
cyber
crime. He
will say he
believes
that
innocent

POL00150242
POL00150242
people
might have
been
wrongly
convicted.
He will
also say
there may
be grounds
for arguing
that the
Horizon
system
(incorporat
ing the
business
processes
around it)
is not as
reliable as
the Post
Office
believed it
to be. He
goes on to
say that if
the PO had
failed to
carry out a
proper
inquiry in
circumstan
ces when
they
should
have, then
some of
the
conviction
s of some
of the
Postmaster
s in the
mediation
scheme
might be
unsafe.

9) With

more than
a hundred
MPs now

POL00150242
POL00150242
saying they
have no
confidence
in the
mediation
scheme we
would like
to ask the
Post Office
what it
thinks is
the correct
way to
move
forward
and find an
equitable
resolution
to the
concerns
of
subPostma
sters up
and down
the
country.

10) In
summary,
we have
found a
number of
experts in
their field
who have
concerns
about the
Horizon
system, the
PO’s
investigati
ons and
prosecutio
ns function
and the
fairness of
the
Subpostma
ster
contract. It
suggests
there is the

POL00150242
POL00150242
possibility
that the
way the
Post Office
goes about
its business
or did go
about its
business
needs
some
proper
explanatio
n. One MP
described
the nature
of the
relationshi
p between
the Post
Office and
SPMRs as
“feudal”,
yet you
call them
your “life
blood”.

The
content of
the
proposed
programm
e is not set
in stone.
This is an
opportunin
ty for the
Post Office
to respond
to the
widesprea
d criticism
it is
currently
facing. I
am seeking
a senior
member of
staff from
the Post
Office who

POL00150242
POL00150242
can explain
everything
from the
Post
Office’s
perspectiv
eso that
we can get
to the
bottom of
what has
happened
to these
people. If
you will
not appear
on camera
then we
ask that
you
provide a
substantive
response
to the
issues
raised
above by
noon this
coming M
onday 15
Dec

Thank you
