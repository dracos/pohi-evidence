Having just read through there is a gap in terms of stakeholders in that we have presented the problems faced, but
not the handling we would deploy, which is the obvious question.

I’m also concerned about the way we have said no deficiencies in Horizon but improvements in training and support
without distinguishing between the two (very separate) issues.

We also need to be aware of BIS being on the sub committee.
I mentioned a next steps slide earlier — is David working on that?

I’ve made some changes in the attached but the stakeholder slides need to have a column with handling proposals
next to them.

I can review again at 2pm.

Hi David,

Please find attached the key messages and stakeholder concerns for the sub-committee pack. Let us know is there is
anything else that you need.

Next steps:

- Mark, Belinda, Chris to review full slide deck with David so that changes can be made and pack can go to sub-
committee COP today

- Brunswick meeting is taking place at 4.30 today in Mark’s room. Could you confirm whether you can attend please.
- we are hoping Brunswick will provide a strategic comms overview by COP Wednesday. Is everyone available at 9am
on Thursday to review this?

Thanks
