POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY

PHASE 4: ACTION TAKEN BY POST OFFICE Ltd AGAINST
SUBPOSTMASTERS

FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF DAVID MELLOWS-FACER
I, MR DAVID MELLOWS-FACER, will say as follows:

Background

This statement responds to the Rule 9 request dated 5th May 2023 from the Post
Office Horizon IT Inquiry. This statement refers to my early involvementin relation to
Marine Drive Post Office.

1. I have been asked by the Inquiry to set out my roles within Post Office, my
qualifications, what training I received and my career progression within Post
Office. I joined Post Office in November 2001.

2. I was originally employed as Head of Area for the North East of England
responsible for all types of offices including Crown, Company Franchise and
individually owned.

3. In May 2002 the area was extended to include more of Yorkshire and Lincolnshire,
but then limited to commercial urban offices. In March 2005 my area was extended
again but limited to the responsibility for sales and no contractual issues.

4. As an Area Manager, my role involved managing a team of line managers,
ensuring standards were maintained or improved in Crown offices and setting

goals for the improvement of sales and standards in sub Post Offices. After March
2005, my role was solely to improve sales in Urban sub Post Officers.

5. I retired from Post Office in July 2008.

Early involvement in relation to Marine Drive Post Office

6. Dueto the passage of time and having retired from Post Office in 2008, I have very
sketchy memories of any dealings with Marine Drive Post Office.

7. I had no dealings with Marine Drive Post Office prior to Mr Castleton being
appointed.

8. I cannotcategorically say when I was first made aware of the issue of shortfalls at
Marine Drive Post Office.

9. Catherine Oglesby was the Retail Line Manager for Marine Drive Post Office. I
cannotsay when I was made aware of the shortfalls. Any discussions would have
included myself, Catherine Oglesby and Lesley Joyce. Lesley Joyce was the
Contract Manager.

10. I have no memory of my first contact with Mr Castleton.

Audit of 23 March 2003

11.1 would have discussed the audit report at POL00082391_004 with Catherine
Oglesby and Lesley Joyce. Every possible check had been carried out to ascertain
possible causes.

12. I have been asked to consider POL00082391_002. I would have been involved in
the decision to suspend Mr Castleton, although I cannot recall the conversation.

Appointment of Temporary SPMs

13. I had no involvement in the appointment of the temporary SPM at Marine Drive.

14.1 cannot recall any shortfalls reported by Ruth Simpson on her first day as the
temporary SPM at Marine Drive. I also cannot recall any further discrepancies
reported by Ruth Simpson, Dorothy Day or Greg Booth.

15. I am not aware of any details relating to these shortfalls.
Dismissal

16.1 have been referred to page 7 of POL00081995. I am not aware of this
conversation with Mr Franks, Mr Castleton’s father-in-law.

17. I could only surmise whatwould have been discussed. I have no actual recollection
of the discussion between myself and Catherine Oglesby following my
conversation with Mr Franks.

18. As above, I have norecollection of any discussions I had with Catherine Oglesby
or Lesley Joyce following Mr Castleton’s interview

19. I have been referred to POL00082391_009. I would have been made aware of the
decision that had been made to dismiss Mr Castleton.

20. Again, I cannot categorically say I had any telephone discussions with Mr
Castleton following the dismissal decision.

21. My view would have been that a computer fault was highly unlikely. Throughout all
my working life performance measures had been based around computer
generated information which was trusted.

22. I have been referred to POLO0082569. I attempted to have Mr Castleton’s appeal
heard as soon as possible.

23.1 have been referred to letters from Mr Castleton to me dated 24 May 2004 in
POL00081995 and 1 June 2004 in POLO0082569. Although I cannot remember if
any other individuals assisted me in responding to Mr Castleton’s letters, the letter
would have been written with input from Lesley Joyce.

24.1 addressed Mr Castleton’s concerns as much as I was able to in my letter of 2
June 2004 in POL00082569.

25. I have been referred to letters from Mr Castleton to me dated 3 June 2004, 8 June
2004 and 18 June 2004 in POLO0082569.

26. I have been referred to page 6 of POL00082569. I have norecollection of the letter
from Mrs C Train dated 8 June 2004.

27.1 had no involvement in Mr Castleton’s case after his dismissal but before
proceedings were commenced against him by Post Office Limited.

28. I have been referred to WITN0O3730100. I have no recollection of Mr Castleton’s
statement that I “would keep pushing and pushing for a sale”.

29. Much effort was made to have regard for Mr Castleton’s wellbeing during the
dismissal process. Catherine Oglesby in particular tried to get to the bottom of
these losses. Many suggestions were made to try and help Mr Castleton identify
any issues that could have contributed.

Post Office Limited -v- Lee Castleton

30.1 have been referred to POLO0070512, LCAS0000609, POL00070841 AND
POL00070477. I was not involved in the case against Mr Castleton, or any other
cases relating to the Horizon IT system.

Knowledge of bugs, errors and defects in the Horizon system
31.1 had no reason to doubt the integrity of the Horizon system.
