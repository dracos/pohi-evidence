For the record, my reply confirming I am happy with your answers below. I have also confirmed the outstanding point to
Amy re employees/temps in DMBs so all signed off from my perspective.

Thanks

Tom

Tom
Thanks for the comments. I've set out below a few explanations for the approach taken on some of your comments.

4. We've (including Rodric ~ cc'd) taken an intentional deci to refer to Crown branches rather than Directly
Managed branches because this mirrors the wording in the GPOC. We considered trying to change terminology
but decided it could become confusing if we refer to DMBs through the litigation and Freeths refer to Crowns. A
judge would just get irritated by this and would likely end up using "Crown" because its shorter to say! I
appreciate that this is not the currently used Post Office terminology but we believe this is the best
approach. Hope that’s ok? - YES FINE BUT GOOD TO KNOW FOR REFERENCE INTERNALLY, PLEASE
NOTE TO MARK D/MEL C FOR FUTURE.

2. The word "embarrassing" has a particular legal meaning in Defences. It's a signal to the Judge that a bit of the
Claim has been very poorly written to cover up for the fact that the Claimants don't believe it to be true. - GOOD
EXAMPLE OF WHAT WE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING, FINE.

3. The word “typically” has been used to mirror the language in the GPOC. In a normal defence, you would never
say “typically” something happens, but give a definitive view on the subject. Due to the generic nature of the
Defence that definitive approach would create hostages to fortune so we've used “typically” to soften certain
points. This is the same word used by the Claimants and so by using their language we cannot be criticised.,
AGAIN, FINE.

4. Ata number of points you ask whether we can positively frame the case. Although I understand why you would
want to do this, it would then create an evidential burden on Post Office to prove that positive case. For exampie.,
f we say that people were instructed to behave honestly, we would then need to adduce evidence of those
instructions (which may mean trawling through thousands of documents and producing witness statements for
dozens of people}. If we say that people were not instructed to behave dishonestly, then the absence of any
evidence proves our point and it is Freeths that need to find the evidence to support their allegation. - AGAIN, I
APPRECIATE THE LEGAL DISTINCTION RE EVIDENTIAL BURDEN AND ACCEPT THIS IS THE RIGHT
APPROACH.

Kind regards
Andy

All

Please find attached the draft Defence for your review and comment. As discussed earlier, if possible please provide
comments rather than amendments to the actual text. f've also attached the Claimants’ Generic Particulars of Claim for
reference.

You'll see a few paints where input from Deloitte and Fujitsu is needed — we expect to get this today.
