Rodric, Mark

Please find attached the draft defence from Tony.

There are lots of minor points chase down - many of which are already with Kath / Shirley and FJ.
The key ones that would be good to discuss tomorrow are:

1. Paras 28, 35 and 55 - these relate to the process for disputing shortfalls. We're struggling to get to the
bottom of those processes and how those disputes are resolved.

2. Para 50(2) - do we say that POL previously relied on incorrect statements from FJ in relation to remote
access? This is basically dropping FJ in it.

The other points I have on my mini agenda for tomorrow are:

1. Prep needed for the GE meeting.

2. Comms lines around the defence and addition of more claimants.

3. Second Sight protocol. We've had a proposal (attached) from Freeths that I can explain tomorrow.
4, Debt team protocol - next steps.

Kind regards
Andy
