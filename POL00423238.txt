2. Background

This is a project that supports separation from Royal Mail Group, enabling self sufficiency for the Post Office.

A disclosure line provides employees and agents with a safe route to report concerns about serious wrongdoing
in their workplace. Encouraging disclosure of wrongdoing by providing a secure way to report it helps Post
Office to:

. detect and deter wrongdoing;
. give managers information needed to improve compliance and control risk;
. demonstrate to stakeholders and regulators that it is serious about good governance;

DISCLOSURE LINE PID - INTERNAL USE ONLY Page 2 of 16
POL00423238
POL00423238

. reduce the chance of anonymous or malicious leaks externally (including to the media);
7 help protect the Post Office brand; and
. reduce the chance of legal claims against Post Office.

Post Office currently has the use of Royal Mail Group’ s disclosure line (the ‘Speak Up Line’ ) provided under
a Transitional Service Agreement (TSA). The TSA ends on 31 March 2013 and Post Office needs to procure and
set up a new line by this date. Over the past three years usage of the line by Post Office employees and agents
has been very low and once the new line is in place communications are planned to raise awareness of the line.

3. Options

1. Do nothing — accept the risk that there is no disclosure line — rejected.

2. Use a third party provider with specialist knowledge of the confidentiality requirements — preferred.

3. Use existing internal resource — no current resource available 24/7 and possible lack of confidentiality —
rejected.

4. Customer Journey/Marketing Consideration
Employees, agents and their assistants will need to be made aware of the new disclosure line/service and the
project will need to ensure carefully targeted communication reaches every level of the business.

The provision of a disclosure line helps to promote the Post Office values as it shows our employees and agents
that we care when things go wrong and that we are committed to finding out when they do. This encourages
trust in the Post Office brand. Although the line is not targeted at external customers, they may see it advertised
in branches or copies of Subspace. A disclosure line forms part of an organisation’ s Corporate and Social
Responsibility (CSR) and anti-bribery corruption framework, and may be asked about by customers and suppliers
as part of CSR or anti-bribery and corruption due diligence.

5. Benefits
The benefits of providing and publicising a confidential, trusted disclosure line include

e Providing employees, agents and their assistants with a mechanism to highlight wrongdoing, supporting both
their integrity and that of the business.

¢ practical embodiment of the Post Office values of care, challenge and commit
¢ ability to investigate problems before they come to public or regulatory attention
e protecting Post Office’ s reputation and brand

¢ minimising regulatory fines.

6. Key Risks And Dependencies

There will be a key dependency on procurement and external testing resources to achieve the implementation
date .

There is a risk that employees use the current shared disclosure line/service in the future, to be mitigated by a

removal of the existing number and replacing it with the new number where it is currently listed.

10. Investment Appraisal (IA) Commentary

POL does not have a dedicated disclosure line (whistle blowing) in place and currently makes use of the RMG
disclosure line ‘Speak Up Line’ .

The £45k request in 12/13 FY includes an annual fee of £30k for the 13/14 FY.

The disclosure line fulfils part of POL’ s CSR objectives and also forms part of the separation of dependencies
on RMG.

Section 2: Project Description

12. Change Description

12.1. Scope and Exclusions

The scope of this project is to procure a new disclosure line to replace the line currently provided by Royal Mail
Group, to implement internal processes to receive reports and forward them for investigation, and to define and
deliver necessary training and communications.

There are already many existing processes in the business for dealing with instances of wrong doing and
misconduct, and they do not fall within the scope of this project.

The supplier will be available to take calls and web reports from employees, agents and agents’ assistants at
any time of day throughout the year. Calls and web reports will be securely forwarded to Post Office in an
agreed format and under agreed timescales to be agreed as part of the contract.

A team in Post Office, within the HR Service Centre will receive the reports and forward them to the appropriate
business area for investigation.

12.2. Constraints

Time — service needs to be in place 31 March 2013. Go-live is Easter Monday, typically there is reduced resource
around this period.

12.3. Acceptance Criteria

The project must ensure the provision of a dedicated Post Office disclosure line on 31 March 2013.

The service line and inter-related supplier and business processes to be tested prior to Go-live.

The supplier must maintain the quality and caller experience of the current line as a minimum.

The supplier must comply with data protection and information security requirements as stated in the service
specifications.

12.4. Impact Analysis

Business areas impacted to deliver this project are: Procurement, HRSC and Comms.

HRSC will need to The fleet service has historically been fully provided by RMG. POL will need to adopt some of
the processes currently carried out by RMG in relation to receipt of reports.

13. High Level Plan
This activity is in three parts

1) Procurement of a third party service to replace the one currently provided by Royal Mail. The initial
analysis for this service has already commenced with informal meetings with potential suppliers. The
target date for issuing the request for proposals is 19 February 2013. Specialist advice has been taken to
include information security and data protection requirements and members of the Info Sec and Data
Protection teams will be involved in reviewing suppliers’ responses. External testing resource will be
utilised for any vulnerability testing required. The service must be in place by 31 March 2013.

2) Development of an internal process in the HR Service Centre for receiving reports from the selected third
party provider and distributing them to the appropriate areas for investigation. Reports will need to be
recorded and investigations tracked, Investigations will be carried out through existing investigation
routes, and these are currently being mapped. Data protection training will be given as required. 15
days of internal testing resource has been budgeted for in case there are any internal systems affected
by the new process. Quarterly summary reports will be submitted to the Audit and Risk Committee, and
there will be an escalation route to a nominated non-executive for the most serious cases. This process
must be in place by 31 March 2013.

3) Internal promotion of the line. An approach has been agreed with Internal Comms to promote the line
with carefully targeted messages through the appropriate channels, which present the line as part of a
suite of help and reporting lines (to also include Grapevine, NBSC, HR Help) in order to minimise the
number of misdirected calls. This activity is planned to start after 1 April 2013 in order to ensure internal
processes are working before call numbers increase.

13.1. Planning Assumptions
Gating and financial authority will be obtained at first request.

The service will need to undergo a procurement exercise to remain compliant with procurement legislation.

POL business resource will be available to support the procurement activity in the timeframes required.

13.2. Test Requirements
Process walkthrough with business owners prior to Go-live
Accessibility points for user access to be tested (Telephone/Web)

Penetration test conducted of any aspects of supplier’ s network used by POL, or sight of the supplier’ s last
test and action plan (and subsequent scan of any web presence for vulnerabilities). £6000 for external testing
has been included above.

There may be internal testing requirement depending on the internal process which are yet to be determined.
A provision has been made for 15 days of internal test resource.
