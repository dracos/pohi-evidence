Master Security Team Skills Database v1 July 2012.xIs

Kevin Ryan!

Thanks for agreeing to manage the skills database going forward. Please find attached the previous version that was

circulated

last summer. We now need to include links for other workstreams into this document such as succession planning
and advanced development

as examples.

Probably a good start is to circulate to all the SLT asking them if it includes all the T&D needs for their strand and any

other suggestions.

Once we receive all the responses we can start to plan how we manage populating the matrix.
I know we’ve got a meeting next week but wanted to get this started asap.
Happy to talk things through if needed.

Tony

Hi Tony,

Attached is the skills matrix so far. Highly doubtful if there will be anymore. If there is more, will forward
them to you.

FYI, Andy Hayward is in the process of meeting some University representative from Leicester University
regarding running any course. (Think in particular MSc Security Risk Management).

Thanks,

Regards,
