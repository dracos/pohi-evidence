Jarnail,

Thank you for your attached email - which I have now received!

I met this morning with Gareth Jenkins who came into the office briefly to meet with me. Gareth will help with this matter.
Although Gareth has been [        1 he should be back to normal working next week. His input will be coordinated by Penny
who is responsible for delivery to POL of support in this Security area.

Attached is a first draft of a statement from Gareth. I would like you to review it and indicate if it answers the questions in
the detail you require.

You will see that there are some areas where Fujitsu cannot deal with the Defendant's expert's criticisms as they are
about POL procedures or requirements and it seems evident that there will need to be a POL internal "expert" who can
work with Gareth to deal with these areas.

One concern is that POL have not apparently requested transaction data for West Byfleet for the period and transactions
in question. This would normally be provided in previous cases and would include Fujitsu extracting log files from the
system to enable us to provide details of transactions. Surprisingly this has not been requested I this case. Perhaps you
would consider the need for this.

Please copy me for information on key developments on this case.

Best wishes


David

Dear Mr Jones,

I refer to our telephone conversations of 4th and 5th February 2010 with
regards to obtaining a witness statement of the Defence challenging the
reliability of Horizon. I understand that Mr Jenkins has been identified
as an experienced person to give this statement. I would be grateful,
after your meeting this morning, if you could confirm to me when Mr
Jenkins would be back to return to duty after his sick leave as I need to
apply to Guildford Crown Court to get an extension to serve his evidence.
As you are aware there is a Court Order for this evidence to be served by
Monday 8th February 201-0 at 4pm.

Thank you for your kind assistance and look forward to hearing from you.
