Subject: Re: The Post Office

Thanks Mike. We (Ian and I) had a further meeting with James Arbuthnot along with Alan Bates from the
Alliance, accompanied by his chosen Forensic Investigator, Kay Linnell. I'm delighted to report that it was a
very positive and creative meeting where we agreed to join forces to get to the underlying truth. The Senior Post
Office Management are supportive of this. I'm away at the moment so we'll start the Case Reviews when I get
back in about 12 days time. In the meantime we'll add the Alison Hall case to the sample.

The idea of carrying out a deep dive into Horizon is on hold until we have completed the Case Reviews. Few
of us think that sort of review will work well. Some of us think it would probably turn out to be a colossal and.
expensive disappointment (for those seeking evidence of anomalies in Horizon). Those pressing for such a
Review now seem happy to wait to see what the Case Reviews throw up. We plan to enhance the MP-driven
sample with some more recent, even current, examples - ideally sourced through the Alliance. That should
provide further evidence of even-handedness by the Post Office, and of the likely reliability of the Case Review
Process.

As to the Horizon - or Process - issues raised by customers, we may come across somebody those during the
Case Reviews. Or the Alliance may hurl some in our direction. All to the good.

Best regards. Ron Warmington

Dear Ron,

Thank you very much indeed for your e-mail and I am sorry to have missed you last
week. However, I merely wished to notify you that the Post Mistress from my area
caught up in this issue, Alison Hall of ©
is keen to have her case investigated.
“personally before asking that she be included in the group you examine.

I understand that the Postmasters’ Alliance are keen to start at the other end as it were
and to have a root and branch examination of the Horizon system. I have told them
that I don’t think anybody will fund this as a starting point but dependent on what any
forensic investigation throws up it may well be that closer scrutiny of the system itself
will be essential.

Whilst writing can I also raise another issue which is the problems said to have been
often found with the Horizon system by customers, e.g. “where payments have been
taken twice and where transactions have been declined because of insufficient funds
available but have still taken the money from the customer's account”. I am not sure
how this can be covered by an investigation which begins by looking at a representative
number of Postmaster/Postmistresses’ cases but it does seem an issue that many of
the Postmasters/Postmistresses and the Alliance are concerned about.

I hope to speak to you soon.

Yours sincerely,

Mike Wood MP
