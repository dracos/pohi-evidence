Hi Andy,

Attached is the Remote Access paper which was returned yesterday with (some) edits and answers provided by FJ.
To be frank, I was a tad disappointed. That said, I have been through, accepted and edited where sensible, made a
couple of further edits (tracked) and added in comments where I think we need FJ to provide further detail,
together with the type of info I would like to them to provide.

Would you mind taking a look? Perhaps then we can have a chat to discuss?

Thanks

Mark
