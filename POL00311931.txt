Attachment: Letter to CCRC (RW 09.02.15).docx

Hi Martin — does this work (full letter attached for context)?

“In respect of the cases it has prosecuted, POL has not been made aware, since the publication of the Second Sight
Interim Report in July 2013 or following the case review summarised in my 5 June 2014 letter to the Commission, of
any applications having been made for permission to appeal against conviction or sentence in the Crown Court, or of
any application to appeal to the Crown Court any Magistrates’ Court conviction or sentence in any Horizon based
prosecution.”

Please give me a call if easier to discuss in the first instance.

Subject: RE: Confirmation re: (No) Appeals against Conviction

Rodric,

The short answer is:- the statement is incorrect.

There are a number of issues:-

The proposed statement does not specify a timescale;

I believe that there have previously been applications for leave to the Court of Appeal;

Virtually every prosecution carried out by POL is Horizon based. Horizon data is used, for
example, to evidence a course of conduct or to calculate quantum;

Pol has “ police liaison” cases which it assists the police to investigate and the CPS to prosecute; It
would not necessarily be informed of applications to appeal in those cases;

The Court of Appeal is now telling us that it cannot say whether any applications are pending in
POL00311931
POL00311931

relation to cases prosecuted by POL. This is something which they would now need to refer to
their IT department to determine whether that information could be provided

I think the most that could be said is that POL is not at the present time aware of any pending
applications for leave to appeal against conviction or sentence.

Kind regards,

Martin.

Martin Smith

Martin, Jarnail —
For the purposes of a letter to the CCRC, is the following statement correct?:

POL had (and has) to date, not received any application for permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal, nor any
application for appeal to the Crown Court against conviction or sentence from the Magistrates' Court, in relation to a
Horizon based prosecution.

Thanks, Rodric
