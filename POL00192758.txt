Shoosmith cases? If so the mediation process will collapse.

>> Alwen, sorry about the delay in responding, but had raised a couple of queries with Kay Linnell yesterday over these types of
processes but have not received a reply yet.

>> The pdf attached refers to the first half of the process described. I am still awaiting a response from Kay in relation to the second
half of the process as it is one of her fields of expertise, although in principle it would seem the logical course of action.

>>

>> Please don't take these views as agreement to the process at this stage, I still need to see more detail about each aspect. I am
really just passing on observations to try and assist with moving the issue forward.

>> Meditation proposal criteria

>

>> 1. Want to ensure that every MP case has the right to mediation, with no cost to them. We also need to understand how many
other JFSA cases need to go through this process

>

>>2. Agreement on proposed process. Why are we proposing this?

>

>>a. it provides, independence through second sight and independent mediator

>

>>b. — should be faster as the workload is shared between SS and mediator

>

>> ec. provides a professionally trained mediator which we think will help bring resolution
>
POL00192758
POL00192758

>>d. gets Second Sight out of the role of both mediator, judge and sub postmaster advocate

>
>>e. process can continue after the MPs cases are completed with little alteration

>

>> 3. After the cases have been completed, final report will be produced by mediator.
>

>> 4. Update to MPs in Oct. could involve mediator and SS can update what they found in the work, POL and JFSA can talk
about mediation process, if we have put some cases through the process by then that would be helpful

>

>> 5. We would like to introduce a Monthly Oversight Board to govern this including JFSA, possibly ask JA willing to chair
>> Weekly Working Group to include SS JFSA POL to bring cases to mediation we clearly need to ensure the terms of reference for
both working groups and for SS are clear going forward.
