Dear Board,

Over the past couple of days, a number of PMs have been in contact with Saf and I in regard to
recent statements at the inquiry by current employees who are still in the business and were involved
in the Horizon scandal. This is a matter than many of us on the Board have expressed concern about
repeatedly as it presents significant reputational risk for the business.

We are regularly told that the review is underway and must be done carefully to ensure accuracy in
decision making - which I fully understand. But to date we have not received any information on a
single employee who has been suspended or dismissed as a result of this ongoing review which
started near 2 years ago but still remains incomplete.

The lack of visible progress on these reviews does not mirror the culture change we have promised
to deliver. Moreover, Postmasters do not believe we are carrying out fair assessments and have
viewed our "redeployment" of the likes of Steve Bradshaw and Pam Heap as "the same old Post
Office".

To that end I would suggest a full and immediate update be provided to the Board of the names and
individual status of all those listed in the Past Roles and the Phoenix reviews so that we are no
longer in the dark on what is going on.

Sincerely,

Elliot
