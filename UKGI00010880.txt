20191210 Settlement Agreement - revised version 19_18 (002).DOCX

Confidentiality clause still there.
Anything else worth noting?

Should we email them to say we think the confidentiality clause is asking for trouble? Particularly as the press
release says nothing about what’s in the agreement?

Richard,

As requested, please find attached the latest version of the settlement agreement.

The parties are very close now on the settlement agreement. There is one outstanding issue which we
are awaiting to hear back from the other side. The content of the agreement reflects a compromise
between the parties. They have agreed not to require the POL CEO to provide individual personal letter
to each claimant. The central risk is that we can’t put a number on the potential new claims that we will
receive as a result of the historical shortfalls but this risk exists irrespective of this settlement. What the
settlement agreement does seek to do is to provide a dispute resolution process to manage the process
more efficiently ultimately culminating in an arbitration on larger claims and hence avoiding another
GLO (and the associated funding costs) although it can’t obviously be ruled out.

I will revert once we have heard back from the other side with hopefully confirmation that the
settlement agreement has been agreed.
