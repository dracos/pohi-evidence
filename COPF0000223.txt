FOS User: Andrew Lazzarin Workstatio:

meeting with Robert Daily and Susan Winters of Post Office and Laura Irvine of
Brechin Tindal Oatts Sols (advising PO). Got copy of interview transcript for
Stewart. They think that there is not enough evidence against El Kasaby and we
should now change her to a witness. She has not given a statement, and her
interview did not record properly so she may not be much use, but RD has some
notes of interview so we can have some idea of what she may say. There are
some discrepancies in the audit figures, but we could potentially proceed on the
admissions and the audit figures are reliable enough to support admissions.
They think that it should be a fraud rather than embezzlement.
