Hi All

Ihave spoken to Dianne Matthews today. The plans are as follows._
Dianne is to meet Brian Pinder Head of Security Fitjitsu at the office on Monday 19/12/05 between 1pm and 4pm. They will
remove part of the kit and will take it away to where it will be stored by Fitjitsu in case it is needed for evidence. It will be boxed
up specially so no damage is done.
Therefore I have had to cancel Romec visit to the office on Thursday as it is really important that no kit is removed before Diane
and Brian Pinder visit the office and remove the parts that they need. After this action another visit will have to be arranged for
Romec to remove the rest of the Kit.
Ihave tried to get hold of Noel Thomas to be able to gain admission to the premises on Monday but got no answer.
Ihave also contacted Denise Miller to keep her up to date

Ellen

IF cant get hold of Noel today would you kindly try him for me Tuesday as I am off. Also can you let NIST know of
where we are up to
Thanks

Sue

Emlyn
9 ohe quickest way forward and verified by Karen's enquiry was to treat as Green field site. This way forward would save
at the least a couple of weeks and get the office opened quicker.

Attached PAFs authorised 2543613 although I would question the need to change FAD code especially if this will delay the
reopening. I would appreciate it if this could be dealt with urgently as we are getting continued presssure from the press and BBC
‘on this matter

Subject, Gaerwen- authorisation of P

Id opening - 160604

Following a request from the C&SM, Sue Hodgins AIO , contacted me re the above office and the latest situation regarding it's
status. This commercial office is currently closed but itis a priority to reopen asap on site for now with an interim (will be new
appointed Subpostmistress Amanda Rowlands ).

The Horizon kit has’ died ‘as it hasn't been used since Oct 14th so we need to take that away and replace it before we can reopen.
Through Sue's initial enquiries on how best to reopen the office quickly, the advice given to her via NIST and Fujitsu was to
permanently close the old site on the current FAD code and strip out Horizon ( not need to remove anything else) and then
request an opening as a greenfield site with a new FAD code and a new install of Horizon kit

Ihave confirmed with Lisa Lavington in NIST that this is possible and therefore have attached 2 new PAFs for you to see and
authorise asap and have assumed that POL will be picking up the costs of this work.

Gaerwen permanent closure PAF 01120: Gaerwen greenfield opening PAF 01120!

If this is all ok can you send on to NI&ST Central Scheduling and copy to all the people above and myself.
