Infrneh id-finn


This witness statement is made to assist the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry (the

"Inquiry") with the matters set out in the Rule 9 Request dated 14 April 2023 (the

"Request").



Background


    1. I am now a Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency Approved Driving Instructor.

    2. It is correct that I was a Client Manager at Post Office Counters Limited

        ("POCL") in 2001. I can not recall the dates I was employed in this role,

        however, the position was to deliver the requirements of what was known as

        "Schedule `A", which set out the delivery of services for the provision of the

         benefit payments and allowance system, which predated the introduction of

                                        Page 1 of 6

                                                                                    WI TN08600100




      the benefits payment card which was to have been used with the introduction

      of automation in post offices. I had no other relevant roles in POCL (later the

      Post Office Ltd ("POL").



Correspondence with the DSS about Cleveleys Post Office


  3. I have been asked to consider the letters dated 10 January 2001 and 11

      January 2001 sent by Angela Smith, of the Financial Services Division of the

      Department of Social Security ("DSS"), to me (POL00095371 and

      POL00095372), along with my response dated 16 January 2001

      (POL00095370). I can not recall the matter in question due to the passage of

      time.

  4. With regards to the concerns being raised with me by Ms Smith in the

      documents above, I can not recall the concerns being raised due to the

      passage of time.

  5. With regards to the information I provided to Ms Smith in response to the

      concerns raised: other than the letters provided, I have no recollection of

      specific details due to the passage of time.

   6. I have been asked what enquiries I made within POCL before I responded to

      Ms Smith. I have no recollection due to the passage of time.

   7. I have been asked what the source was of the information I provided, and in

      particular, what the source was of the position that "Post Office Counters Ltd

      is satisfied with the performance of the Horizon platform, including the

      operation of OBCS within this environment"? I am unable to recall that

      information requested due to the passage of time.

                                                                                  WI TN08600100




8. I have been asked whether it my understanding (with reference to my

   comment that there was "some dissension with staff who have found the

   transition challenging") that some staff had reported problems with the

   functioning of the Horizon IT system. I can not recall what this relates to.

9. I have been asked whether I or others at POCL consider that the problems

   which staff were having with the Horizon IT system at this time were caused

   by user error or by a fault with the Horizon IT system and why. I am unable to

   recall this incident due to the passage of time.

10. I have been asked whether I considered Julie Wolstenholme to be one of the

   "individuals who, for what ever reason, are resistant to or find it hard to cope

   with change"? I do not know Julie Wolstenholme.

11. I have reviewed the correspondence from 2001 between myself and Lisa

   Crabtree from the Financial Services Division of the DSS at POL00095362,

   P0L00095361, P0L00095360 and P0L00095359.

12. 1 have been asked to explain what prompted the above correspondence, and

   in particular what the "errors" being reported were. I can not recall what this

   relates to due to the passage of time.

13. I do not recall what had caused the "errors" due to the passage of time.

14. I have been asked what the checks of the accounts done by "Chesterfield"

   (understood to be where the Product, Branch & Accounting team, later the

   Financial Services Unit, was based) show. I cannot recall this due to the

   passage of time.

15. I cannot recall whether the "former subpostmistress" referred to by me in my

   letter dated 17 July 2011 is Ms Wolstenholme.

                                                                                     WI TN08600100




   16.As to the "difficulties" being experienced by Ms Wolstenholme in operating the

      Horizon system, I cannot recall what this matter was about now due to the

      passage of time.

   17. 1 have been asked whether the two "under claims" being reported by the DSS

      were picked up and rectified by error notices when they occurred by the

      relevant accounting team at POL, and if not why. I do not remember how the

      under claims were highlighted in the first place due to the passage of time.

   18. 1 have been asked whether, if such errors were not picked up by a

      subpostmaster or the relevant accounting team within POL at the time, the

      result might be a balance discrepancy. I do not know the answer to this point.

   19. 1 have been asked whether any other "errors" linked to the Horizon system

      were reported to me by the DSS when I held the role of Client Manager. I

      have no such details.

Other involvement in the Cleveleys case


   20. I have been asked to explain any other involvement in or knowledge I had

      about the circumstances which led to the suspension of Ms Wolstenholme

      and / or the case of The Post Office v Mrs J Wolstenholme. I have no

      knowledge.

   21. I have been asked to consider the memo to Tina Davis, Network Trading

      dated 12 March 2001 (POL00095364) and her response dated 13 March

      2001 (POL00095363). I have been asked whether the Tim Bentley involved in

      this correspondence me, and if so, to explain the request I made for

      information and what I understood from the information provided in response.

      I am the Tim Bentley in the memo dated 13th March 2001, however, I can not

                                                                                       WI TN08600100




        recollect, due to the passage of time, the request for information, however,

        assume it is related to the enquiry from the Benefits Agency.

   22. I can not recall what concerns, if any, I had to the press article about the

        Cleveleys Post Office due to the passage of time.

   23. Due to the passage of time I do not recall whether the matter came up at the

        Service Review Meeting in April however or what was discussed, however it

        may have come up.



Knowledge of bugs, errors and defects in the Horizon system

   24. 1 have been asked whether I had, or whether I was aware of, any concerns

        regarding the robustness of the Horizon IT system during my time working for

        the Post Office. I did not work directly on the Horizon system, and have no

        opinion.

Other matters


   25. There are no other matters that I could bring to the Inquiry.
