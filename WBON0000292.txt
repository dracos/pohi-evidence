There are a number of points relating to Angela’s Horizon ws that have emerged over recent days that need to be
addressed with Angela:

- Robert mentioned during our meeting yesterday that he cannot see how the transaction data Angela
refers to in her statement enables her to arrive at the conclusions she does re individual SPMs. Robert
assumes that there is more in this data than appears to his untutored eye but we obviously need to
confirm whether this is correct (and if so what those additional points are) and if not how she has reached
the views she has

- When reviewing someone’s transaction data (I’m not sure whose but Robert may recall) Robert said he
saw that it was full of references to balancing transactions (he thought for parcels etc): he and we assume
that this must be a different sort of Balancing Transaction to the ones we refer to in the context of injecting
data but we need to understand this properly

- 2 points re 18.4-18.5 of her ws: First, are the points in these paras internally contradictory since in 18.4. a
reference is made to an insertion at the counter and in 18.5 to insertion at the data centre — but isn’t 18.4
also a remote insertion? And if so, how is it that the points made in 18.4 don’t equally apply to 18.5.
Secondly, we were told the other day that Angela does not in fact have direct knowledge of these matters
but gave this evidence because these points had emerged at the time she was making her statement. She
says at the beginning of her statement that her evidence is within her knowledge or she has stated its
source: that is not the case here.

These points need to be raised with Angela and an explanation provided.

Thanks
Simon
