(oe) RMGA User Management Procedure
FUJITSU COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE

1. Introduction

The User Management Guidelines is to help managers and users of both physical and technical assets
within the RMGA account and FS supporting functions. It sets out how accesses to these assets are to
be created, managed, and removed and explains how they are to be monitored and reviewed.

1.1 Scope

This document covers buildings, rooms, networks, support, estate management, applications and tools
used by RMGA and any associated third parties (external and Fujitsu internal) to provide and meet both
it's contractual and regulatory obligations to Post Office Ltd.

1.2 Purpose

This document establishes the controls that RMGA has to meet to manage user access to its assets,
based on its contractual requirements stated in schedule A4 (Policies and Standards), in particular the

following sections:
4.1.2 “Fujitsu Services shall be compliant with ISO 27001.”

4.1.4 “Fujitsu Services shall adhere to the relevant parts of the CCD entitled “Community
Information Security Policy for Horizon” (RM/POL/002*) and co-operate with Post Office
to assist Post Office in complying with this standard and requirement.

4.1.5 “The confidentiality, integrity, validity, and completeness of data shall be maintained
throughout all storage, processes, and transmissions, including during periods of Service

Failure and recovery from Service Failure.”

*RM/POL/002 has since been superseded by SVM/SEC/POL/0005.

1.2.1 1$027001

ISO 27001 has two clear sections, the clauses which are detailed in sections 4-8 and those which are
guidelines as to best practices in Annexes 5.-15, usually referred to with an A preceding them.

To assist users of this document detailed in Appendix A are those clauses of ISO 27001, their reference
within the standard, the area which the controls are expected to be applied to, and the details of the
control and its ownership. As can be seen ownership falls throughout the whole organisation and
throughout all areas of the business.

In the ISO 27001 framework the controls that we are required to meet fall into the following generic
areas, People, Infrastructure, Applications, Control, Operations and Management Review and Monitoring
as is in Appendix A.

1.2.2 Security Requirements

Information Security is based on a number of precepts, the most important of which are defined as being;
confidentiality, integrity and availability. In addition, other properties such as authenticity, accountability
non-repudiation, and reliability are involved.

These are broad categories of security controls which can be employed to provide various levels of
security to guard against specific or perceived ‘risks’ which have been jointly identified by Post Office Ltd
and Fujitsu. This document defines the policies for controlling access to the RMGA IT system in
compliance with the Post Office CISP.

BS/ISO IEC 20002, “A Code of Practice for Information Security Management,” is primarily concerned
with management and operational controls, but also sets out a number of technical security controls.
BS/ISO IEC 20002 is used as the basis of RMGA Security Policy and Procedures to define the controls
used throughout RMGA.

Fujitsu Services shall operate a quality management system, which complies with BS EN ISO 9001:2008.

Controlling access to IT resources requires a combination of directive, preventive, detective, corrective,
and recovery controls that are used to manage hardware, software, operations, data, media, network
equipment, support systems, physical areas, and personnel. They involve both manual procedures as
well as technical controls on the IT system.

Documents defining the Corporate Fujitsu (UK & Ireland) related policies, processes and procedures that
are used take precedence over any RMGA documentation, are held on Café Vik at:

guidance given in SVM/SEC/POL/0003 RMGA Information Security Policy and SVM/SDM/POL/0027
RMGA Access Control Policy.

This document is therefore solely a set of guidelines concerned with the way that RMGA administers
those people who join, move, or leave its account.

Reference to all technical details of how this is managed is shown in the document list included in section

2 Process

2.1 User management

User management within the RMGA is based on the creation and control of a complete list of all
personnel who work on or have access to systems on the RMGA. This list is controlled by the CS
Security team, and is reviewed and updated on a monthly basis to aid any Audit that may be recorded,
with the following areas considered:

Joiners — On a monthly basis, all team managers notify the CS Security team of all personnel who join
the RMGA after that person has gone through the required security checks.

Leavers - On a monthly basis, all team managers notify CS Security team of anyone who no longer works
on the RMGA. Any person who leaves the account, this list is used to check and remove any access
permissions they may have had.

Movers — The CS Security team is informed of anyone who leaves one team and joins another team
within the RMGA. Any person who changes their role within the account, the list is used to check that
their access permission is still correct for their new role.

Detailed below are the steps that must be followed prior to an individual who is new to Fujitsu Services
joining RMGA.

1. Prior to an individual joining RMGA a line manager must follow HR Direct policies and
procedures for a new starter these are found on the Cafevik Internal Website for Human
Resources http://www.cafevik fs fujitsu.com/index.aspx?portal=152 and advise and guidance can
be obtained from HR Professional services.

2. The line manager requesting the new person must ensure that any information passed to HR
details clearly that the role, the function, and job details the individual will be undertaking. It must
clearly state the person is working on the RMGA account and provide any forms required to HR
and Group Security for reference checking. Details of any forms required for Security vetting are
held on http://www.cafevik.fs.fujitsu.com/index.aspx?portal=107 .

3. HR will pass the forms detailing security checks to group security and they will ensure that they
have Fujitsu Services basic checks and because the individual is working on the RMGA account
specific Credit worthiness and Criminal Record checks. (N.B. if the individual is to work on any
Government related Post Office Ltd functions there may be a requirement for additional checks
and this will need to be stated by the line manager to HR)

4. The line manager will receive details back from HR confirming whether the individual is accepted
or rejected in this role.

5. If the individual is rejected then HR procedures detailed at
http:/Awww.cafevik.fs. fujitsu.com/index.aspx?portal=152 will be followed and advice to the line
manager can again be obtained from HR professional services.

6. If the individual is accepted into this role and requires access to the RMGA live network then the
process described in SVM/SEC/PRO/006 “RMGA APPLICATION FOR ACCESS TO THE LIVE
NETWORK’ is followed and the form in Annex A sent by the line manager to Operational
Security mailbox CSPOA Security.

7. Guidance as to the roles available and their functionality on the live network is detailed in
DES/SEC/HLD/0004 HNG-X Authorization High Level Design and devgenspg0012 Active
Directory Support Guide.

8. Details of this user and there role is then compared to the role definitions detailed in
DES/SEC/HLD/0004 and provided they are documented in here then Operational Security will
approve the individuals acceptance into the live network

9. The Operational Security will maintain a record of all users that have been approved and their
roles and clearance levels and review this regularly.

10. The Operational Management of user access to the live systems is controlled under Operational
Level agreements with FS SoP in Northern Ireland and is subject to OLA agreements for Data
centres SDM/SDM/OLA/0014 and for NT and Unix SDM/SDM/OLA/0015 and users will then be
set up using their procedures.

11. If users do not require access to the live network but other FS support systems for RMGA e.g.
Dimensions, Doors, HP Openview , PEAK, Operational Change systems , then it is the
responsibility of the team manager managing this function to ensure processes, procedures and
work instructions are in place for the acceptance, change and removal of users from these
systems. They must also ensure that the criterion for ISO 27001 compliance is available for
RMGA audit.

12. In addition, Operational Security will notify Group property and Facilities management
http://www.cafevik.fs.fujitsu.com/index.aspx?portal=106 to ensure that their access to dedicated
RMGA locations is approved.

2.3 Movers

In addition to individuals who join RMGA as new staff in Fujitsu Services, there are cases where people
with key skills are brought onto the account to perform specific specialist functions. This type of staff may
be a contractor employed by Post Office Ltd, a third party employed by Fujitsu or an individual who
belongs to another area of Fujitsu. This applies particularly to Post Office Ltd Joint test team, and
individuals brought into the account from Architecture and Design practices.

In addition, individuals may change roles within the RMGA account and therefore their access will need
to be reviewed.

14.

If a specialist is to be brought into the account then Line managers will obtain approval through
RMGA's change management system to obtain the specialist resource by raising a Change
Proposal as defined in PA/PRO/0001 Change Management Process.

Line Mangers will then apply for a RIO or Eric according to FS procedures as detailed on Cafevik
at http://toolset .fs.fujitsu.com/InternalRequests.asp and follow the corporate procedures.

The line manager must advise HR that these individuals are transferring into the account and
provide the Eric and Rio references and the date that these individuals moved roles. The
procedures for a these new RMGA staff are on the Cafevik Internal Website for Human
Resources http://www. cafevik.fs.fujitsu.com/index.aspx?portal=152 and advise and guidance can
be obtained from HR Professional services.

For any change of role, the line manager requesting the transferred person must ensure that any
information passed to HR details clearly that the role, the function, and job details the individual
will be undertaking. It must clearly state the person is working on the RMGA account and provide
any forms required to HR and Group Security for reference checking. Details of any forms
required for Security vetting are held on http://www.cafevik fs fujitsu.com/index.aspx?portal=107 .

HR will pass the forms detailing security checks to group security and they will ensure that they
have Fujitsu Services basic checks and because the individual is working on the RMGA account
specific Credit worthiness and Criminal Record checks. (N.B. if the individual is to work on any
Government related Post Office Ltd functions there may be a requirement for additional checks
and this will need to be stated by the line manager to HR). If these checks have already been
undertaken as, it is an internal check then this may be skipped.

The line manager will receive details back from HR confirming whether the individual is accepted
or rejected in this role.

If the individual is rejected then HR procedures detailed at
http://www. cafevik.fs.fujitsu.com/index.aspx?rtal=152 will be followed and advice to the line
manager can again be obtained from HR professional services.

If the individual is not employed by RMGA directly then they need to sign an NDA that requests
them to maintain all information that they gather whilst on the account is confidential and must
not go outside the account, without the specific permission of the RMGA CISO.

If the individual is accepted into this role and requires access to the RMGA live network then the
process described in SVM/SEC/PRO/006 “RMGA APPLICATION FOR ACCESS TO THE LIVE
NETWORK’ is followed and the form in Annex A sent by the line manager to Operational
Security mailbox CSPOA Security.

Guidance as to the roles available and their functionality on the live network is detailed in
DES/SEC/HLD/0004 HNG-X Authorization High Level Design and devgenspg0012 Active
Directory Support Guide.

Details of this user and their role is then compared to the role definitions detailed in
DES/SEC/HLD/0004 and provided they are documented in here then Operational Security will
approve the individuals acceptance into the live network

The Operational Security will maintain a record of all users that have been approved and their
roles and clearance levels and review this regularly.

The Operational Management of user access to the live systems is controlled under Operational
Level agreements with FS SoP in Northern Ireland and is subject to OLA agreements for Data
centres SDM/SDM/OLA/0014 and for NT and Unix SDM/SDM/OLA/0015 and users will then be
set up using their procedures.

RMGA Operational Security will be notified by the operational management team to the CSPOA
Security mailbox when this has occurred and will update their records.
