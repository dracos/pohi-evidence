Enhanced the monthly PAM verification processes

Introduced additional monthly reporting of numerous types of physical and user account
privileged usage

Introduced additional weekly reporting for POL on PAM account status

ENQUIRY SUPPORT

Introduced a simple enquiry mailbox for POL and its legal representatives and assigned a multi-
skilled team to be available to review and actions (PO.Enquiries@ and the channels we proposed
prior to this)

APPSUP

Removed the default privilege APPSUP and made it an on-demand controlled allocation of
temporary rights (this was done in 2018 I believe)

APPSUP is not used to correct branch balance discrepancies or to amend financial transactions.
Corrections relating to branch balance discrepancies are performed by POL using the POL
Transaction Correction Process (this is true - just not sure if we implemented that because of the
criticisms in the cases or if this has always been true) [WIP]

Implemented a new process for APPSUP that ensures a new POL approval process can be
integrated and evidence of action taken provided

RISK MANAGEMENT

alignment and clearer action tracking

Enhanced risk management with POL - expanding to cover all domains and part of a monthly
review

ARQ

« Provided POL with a full list of data available to them in the audit archive - to support POL's
postmaster investigation processes [Early days]
