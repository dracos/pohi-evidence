Dear all — please note Dave Smith’s thanks to you all for your work on this important case.

Dave and the ET have been aware of the significance of these challenges and have been supportive of the excellent
work going on in so many teams to justify the confidence that we have in Horizon and in our supporting processes.

This is an excellent result and a big thanks to everyone.

Subject: REGINA v SEEMA MISRA - GUILDFORD CROWN COURT - TRIAL - ATTACK ON HORIZON

Dear All,

After a lengthy trial at Guildford Crown Court the above named was found Guilty of theft. This case turned from a
POL00169170
POL00169170

relatively straightforward general deficiency case to an unprecedented attack on the Horizon system. We were beset
with unparallel degree of disclosure requests by the Defence. Through hard work of everyone, Counsel Warwick
Tatford, Investigation Officer Jon Longman and through the considerable expertise of Gareth Jenkins of Fujitsu we
were able to destroy to the criminal standard of proof (beyond all reasonable doubt) every single suggestion made by
the Defence.

It is to be hoped the case will set a marker to dissuade other Defendants from jumping on the Horizon bashing
bandwagon.

Dear All

I have been made aware of the fact that many of us are on annual leave next week because of half term. In the
circumstances it seems likely that we will have to reschedule again. Please accept my apologies for this. I will get my
secretary to reschedule.

Regards
Mandy Talbot
