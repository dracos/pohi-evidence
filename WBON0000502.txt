Response in >>>>

Read through it all. Two comments - on this statement...

(1) AILIT systems experience software coding errors or bugs which require fixes to be developed
and implemented. For a system of Horizon’s scale, Post Office would characterise the number of
errors or bugs in Horizon requiring fixes as relatively low. In any event, as is noted in paragraph [53

and 54XX] below, there are robust measures in place for their detection, correction and remediation.

Can we say they are relatively low? Where did this come from? Not sure I could say this without further
data. THIS IS FJ's LANGUAGE AND THEY WERE HAPPY WITH IT.

>>> Can they defend it? If so — do we need to assign to FJ; the bit I am concerned about is “Post
Office would characterise the number of errors or bugs in Horizon requiring fixes as relatively low...” I
wouldn’t/ couldn’t !

2; As to paragraph 27, it is admitted that, although Hotizen-was-not- designed te-have this funetionatity this

would not usually be classified as "functionality", there was a highly theoretical possibility that certain Fujitsu
personnel could abuse their privileged user rights to circumvent the protections in the system as designed so as
to edit or delete branch transaction data as described in paragraph [57(4)XX] above.

I don’t think it needs the phrase “ although Horizon was not designed to have this functionality” — its not
functionality — admin access is available in every system globally. I would state — In common with all
systems that have administration access .... (which is all). Rob —I can see the force of this argument. We've
discussed this before with Tony. Although from a technical point of view admin access is not functionality,
we decided that this argument would be overly technical and semantic in the eyes of the judge. Is the
amended language above better?

>>> Suggest this.....

All

Please find attached the draft Defence for your review and comment. As discussed earlier, if possible please provide
comments rather than amendments to the actual text. I've also attached the Claimants' Generic Particulars of Claim
for reference.

You'll see a few points where input from Deloitte and Fujitsu is needed — we expect to get this today.

Please send any comments to me and Amy Prime (copied).

Thanks
Andy
