           By Anne Chambers at 26-feb-2004 13:12:00 Category 40 - Incident Under Investigation KEL quoted is irrelevant - if the
           audit log had been checked, it would have shown a different error message. The event was part of a storm which
           occurred over the estate that night as a result of a faulty software fix, and has nothing to do with the discrepancies.

           NO TRANSACTION DATE AND TIME WAS PROVIDED FOR THIS ACTION USING CURRENT DATE AND TIME By
           Anne Chambers at 26-feb-2004 15:16:00 Category 94 - Advice and guidance given I have checked various things on the
           system. All the internal reconciliation checks are ok. Cheques are being handled correctly (except for 10th Feb when the
           clerk forgot to cut off the report - but this didn't cause a discrepancy). Cash declarations look ok, they usually use drawer
           id 11 ;; Occasionally they have used a different drawer id, this can lead to amounts apparently doubling on the cash flow
           report, and should be avoided. But again it will not cause a discrepancy. Checking the cash transactions on the system
           against the declarations shows that they are not working particularly accurately (i.e. at the end of the day the cash they
           declare in the drawer is tens, hundreds or thousands of pounds astray from what has been recorded on the system). It is
           possible that they are not accurately recording all transactions on the system. There is no evidence whatsoever of any
           system problem. I've mentioned this outlet to Julie Welsh (Customer Services) who will try to get POL to follow it up, but
           in the meantime please tell the PM that we have investigated and the discrepancies are caused by the difference
           between the transactions they have recorded on the system and the cash they have declared, and are not being caused
           by the software or hardware.

 Richard,
 I have had a chat with Anne, she used the message store viewing to
 investigate this. If you want copies of extracts for the particular
 incorrect declarations please submit an ad hoc request requesting this
 information. Hope this helps, see below:
 NO TRANSACTION DATE AND TIME WAS PROVIDED FOR THIS ACTION USING CURRENT
 DATE
 AND TIME By Anne Chambers at 26-feb-2004 15:16:00 Category 94 - Advice and
 guidance given I have checked various things on the system. All the
 internal
 reconciliation checks are ok. Cheques are being handled correctly (except
 for 10th Feb when the clerk forgot to cut off the report - but this didn't
 cause a discrepancy). Cash declarations look ok, they usually use drawer id
 11. Occasionally they have used a different drawer id, this can lead to
amounts apparently doubling on the cash flow report, and should be avoided.
But again it will not cause a discrepancy. Checking the cash transactions
on
the system against the declarations shows that they are not working
particularly accurately (i.e. at the end of the day the cash they declare
in
the drawer is tens, hundreds or thousands of pounds astray from what has
been recorded on the system). It is possible that they are not accurately
recording all transactions on the system. There is no evidence whatsoever
of
any system problem. I've mentioned this outlet to Julie Welsh (Customer
Services) who will try to get POL to follow it up, but in the meantime
please tell the PM that we have investigated and the discrepancies are
caused by the difference between the transactions they have recorded on the
system and the cash they have declared, and are not being caused by the
software or hardware.
