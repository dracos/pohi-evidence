By Anne Chambers at 26-feb-2004 13:12:00 Category 40 - Incident Under Investigation KEL quoted is irrelevant - if the
audit log had been checked, it would have shown a different error message. The event was part of a storm which
occurred over the estate that night as a result of a faulty software fix, and has nothing to do with the discrepancies.

Richard,

I have had a chat with Anne, she used the message store viewing to
investigate this. If you want copies of extracts for the particular
incorrect declarations please submit an ad hoc request requesting this
information. Hope this helps, see below:

NO TRANSACTION DATE AND TIME WAS PROVIDED FOR THIS ACTION USING CURRENT
DATE

AND TIME By Anne Chambers at 26-feb-2004 15:16:00 Category 94 - Advice and
