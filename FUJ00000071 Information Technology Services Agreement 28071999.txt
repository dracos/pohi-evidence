SCHEDULE A06 - APPROACH TO REMEDIES

oe

4.2

PURPOSE

This Schedule sets out the approach to remedies which shall be applicable to all POCL
Services.

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

‘The purpose of remedies is that POCL shall not be disadvantaged by failures of the
Contractor to provide the POCL Services to the agreed specification and reliability.

Remedies in failure to meet Service Levels are designed so that:

(a) POCL will not pay for POCL Services which it does not receive or will pay a
reduced amount for POCL Services which fail to meet the Service Levels;

(b} POCL wil be compensated for loss or damage which it incurs as a result of
unavailability of POCL Services or POCL Services failing to meet Service
Levels;

{c) Repeated failure as defined in paragraph 4.4 or serious failure as defined in
paragraph 4.5 by the Contractor to provide any POCL Service to the
appropriate Service Levels will entitle POCL to terminate the Codified
Agreement in accordance with Clause 902.2.

The limits on the Contractor's Habiliry contained in Clause 810 shall apply to financial
remedies due in accordance with this Schedule.

APPLICATION TO SERVICES
For each POCL Service supplied under the Codified Agreement the relevant Service

Levels and Remedies Schedule shal! define the measures of Service Levels and
remedies.

SERVICE LEVELS

There are two (2) Service Level thresholds:

(a) Minimum Acceptable Threshold;

{b) Termination Review Threshold.

Service Levels shall be measured and reported over Service Level Measurement
Periods and using metrics defined for each POCL Service. Additionally all levels of
service shall be monitored on a weekly and monthly basis and any failure to meet a

Service Level shall be reported to POCL detailing the required Service Level and the
actual level of service achieved.

FUJ00000071

FUJ00000071

in respect of any Service Level Measurement Period when the level of service falls
below the threshold in paragraph 4.1{a), POCL shall be entitled to remedies at the
end of that period as set out in the relevant Service Level and Remedies Schedule.

Unless specified otherwise in the relevant Service Levels and Remedies Schedule,
where the Contractor fails to meet the threshold in paragraph 4.1 (a) for a particular
POCL Service for three (3) quarterly Service Level Measurement Periods in any
twenty four (24) month period, then POCL may terminate the Codified Agreement in
accordance with Clause 902.2. If POCL decides not to exercise its termination rights
hereto, then rectification of the Default shall be made in accordance with paragraph
7.

If the Jevel of service fails to meet the threshold in paragraph 4.1 (b) for a particular
POCL Service, POCL may terminate the Codified Agreement in accordance with
Clause 902.2. If POCL decides not to exercise its termination rights hereto, then
rectification of the Default shall be made in accordance with paragraph 7.

PAYMENT OF REMEDIES

the Criteria in paragraphs 5.2(i) and (ii) above, the Expert shall be appointed at
the request of POCL or the Contractor by the President for the time being of the
Institute of Electrical Engineers so long as such appointee shall meet the criteria
in paragraphs 5.2(i) and (ii) above.

The Expert shal! act as an expert and not an arbitrator and his fees shall be
borne by the parties in equal shares.

ACCEPTANCE DISPUTES

If paragraph 2.6 of this Schedule applies and/or POCL and the Contractor do
not agree on:

qi) the CSR Acceptance Specifications;
Gi whether an event or occurrence is an Acceptance Incident; or
Gil} the assigned severity of an Acceptance Incident:

the parties will refer such dispute (the “Dispute”) to the Expert to obtain initial
guidance. The parties do not expect that the identification and notification of
the Dispute, reference of the Dispute to the Expert and obtaining his initial
guidance should take longer than seven days.

Once the Expert has given to the parties his initial guidance on the Dispute, the
Managing Director of POCL and the Commercia! Director of ICL shall meet an
attempt to resolve the Dispute with the advice and guidance of the Expert.

If the Dispute is not resolved during the meeting pursuant to paragraph 6.2
above, then the Expert shall be required to make a decision (the “Decision”) as

Once the Decision has been made, the Managing Director of POCL and the
Commercial Director of ICL shall meet to review and respond to the Decision.

The Decision shall be binding unless vetoed by POCL in accordance with
paragraph 6.6 below.

POCL may veto the Decision if:

fa) POCL disagrees with the Decision and provides to the Contractor written
reasons for such disagreement; and

(b) asserts a Veto Ground (as defined in paragraph 6.8 of this Schedule).

If POCL vetoes the Decision, the Managing Director of POCL and the

Office and of ICL shall meet and attempt to resolve the Dispute. However,
unless and until otherwise agreed, the veto will stand.

Each of the following shall be a Veto Ground, namely if the issue:-

@ materially affects POCUs ability to settle with clients in a timely and
accurate way;

ai) materially affects POCLs ability to transact with sub-postmasters in a
timely and accurate way;

(iii) is Ukely to materially and adversely affect POCL customers in areas
covered by service level agreements;

of POCL;

{v) materially compromises the integrity of Post Office accounting systems;
or

(vi) is Likely to lead to the qualification of Post Office accounts or those of its

then sub-paragraph 3.1 of this Schedule shall apply save that the direct costs of
and associated with such extra work as shall be required as a consequence of
the exercise of the veto shall be dealt with in accordance with paragraph 6.10
of this Schedule. If, but for POCL vetoing a Decision in favour of the Contractor,
CSR Acceptance would have been achieved, and the Acceptance Test in
question was the Second CSR Acceptance Test, it shall be deemed to have been
the first.

The direct costs of and associated with the extra work referred to in paragraph
6.9 of this Schedule shall initially be borne by POCL. However, POCL shail be
entitled to refer the Expert's decision in relation to the Dispute to an arbitrator
in accordance with paragraphs 6.11 and 6.12 of this Schedule. If the arbitrator
rules in favour of POCL in respect of the Dispute then the Contractor shall,

The Contractor shall analyse each Acceptance Incident in accordance with the
guidelines defined in the relevant Acceptance Specification, and categorise each
Acceptance Incident within the following principles: .

(ay failure to meet an Acceptance Criterion essential te the Deliverable or
POCL Service shall be designated a high severity deficiency;

(b} failure to meet an Acceptance Criterion which is highly desirable for the
Deliverable or POCL Service shall be designated a medium severity
deficiency;

(c) failure to meet an Acceptance Criterion which is desirable for the
Deliverable or PO shall be designated a low severity
deficiency;

(d} an Acceptance Incident which does not relate to an Acceptance

Criterion, but which identifies a failure to meet any other obligation
under this Codified Agreement and, in the reasonable opinion of POCL,
represents a substantive fault equivalent to, and categorised according
to, part (a), (b) or (ec) of this paragraph; or

(e} none of the above.

Other than for category (e) above, the analysis of an Acceptance Incident shall
not of itself be sufficient to resolve the Acceptance Incident. Resolution of an
Acceptance Incident shall only occur when the deficiency or fault has been
corrected by the Contractor and the relevant parts of the Acceptance Test have
been repeated without further category (a), (b) or (c) Acceptance Incidents

arising.

POCL may, at its sole discretion and in accordance with Clause 612, waive in

5.8.2 If in respect of any Operating Fee Period the Adjusted Periodic Payment is
greater than the Periodic Payment then the Monthly Operating Fee in respect
of the final month in that Operating Fee Period shall be increased by an
amount equal to the Adjustment Amount for that Operating Fee Period.

5.8.3 If in respect of any Operating Fee Period the Adjusted Periodic Payment is less
than the Periodic Payment then the Monthly Operating Fee in respect of the
final month in that Operating Fee Period shall be reduced by an amount equal
to the Adjustment Amount for that Operating Fee Period.

The parties acknowledge that with effect from the CS Completion Date the Monthly
Operating Fee includes:

@ a Transaction volume cost element of 7%, which is based upon the
Transaction volume forecast as set out in Annex 2 to this Schedule; and

ap an Outlet cost element of 32%, which is based upon the parties’ intention that
the Contractor will roll out the Core System to 18,527 Outlets.

The amount of the Transaction volume cost element shall be adjusted for each month
by multiplying it by the proportion which the actual Transaction volume (calculated
in accordance with Annex 3 to this Schedule 4) in respect of that month bears to the
Transaction volume forecast in respect of that month (ascertained by dividing by 12
the annual forecast for the relevant year set out in Annex 2 to this Schedule A12).

The Outlet cost element shall be adjusted for each month by multiplying it by the
proportion which the average number of Outlets to which Roll Out had occurred
during that month (calculated by adding the number of Outlets to which Roll Out
had occurred on the last day of that month to the number to which Roll Out had
occurred on the last day of the immediately preceding month and dividing by two)
bears to 18,527.

In respect of the following Outlets Roll Out shall take place under the Operational
Business Change regime (subject to paragraph 5.10.2), namely:-

(a) those Outlets in Part B of the Roll Out Programme; and

(b) those Outlets in Part A of the Roll Out Programme in respect of which, after
the Outlet has been made ready for installation, circumstances arise (other
than as a result of Default by the Contractor or where such Outlet requires a
Mobile Counter Configuration which has not been made available by the
Contractor to the reasonable satisfaction of POCL) which make it impractical
to complete such installation prior to 12 February, 2001.

The cost of installation of Outlets as Operational Business Change as referred to in
paragraph 5.10.1 is included in the Roll Out Payment (but without prejudice to the
provisions of paragraph 6.1 of, and Annex 4 to, this Schedule A12) and shall be
disregarded for the purposes of calculating other charges payable from time to time

in respect of Operational Business Change, except, in each case, where the work
carried out in respect of the Outlet takes place after the end of the week commencing
14 May, 2001 (other than where the delay in carrying out such work arises as a
result of Default by the Contractor or where such outlet requires a Mobile Counter
Configuration which had not been made available by the Contractor to the
reasonable satisfaction of POCL). Where the aforesaid exception applies the
Contractor may be required to carry out the relevant work as Operational Business
Change but subject to the normal Operational Business Change charges applicable to
that work,

Subject to paragraph 5.10.4, Outlets which are transferred to the Operational
Business Change regime under paragraph 5.10.1 will be taken into account in
calculating the total number of Outlets at which installation of counter equipment is
to take place for the purpose of determining whether POCL is entitled to make a
retention, or required to refund any retention, under paragraph 3 of Part A of
Schedule A12.

Where pursuant to paragraph 5.10.1(b) above an Outlet becomes subject to the
Operational Business Change regime and by 30 June, 2001 POCL shall have failed to
instruct the Contractor to schedule that Outlet for installation of counter equipment
by 30 November, 2001 then (excepr where such failure is as a result of a Default by
the Contractor or where such Outlet requires a Mobile Counter Configuration which
shall not have been made available by the Contractor to the reasonable satisfaction
of POCL):

(a) that Outlet will cease to be taken into account in calculating the number of
Outlets requiring to be installed for the purpose of determining whether
POCL is entitled to make a retention, or required to refund any retention,
under paragraph 3 of Part A of Schedule A12; and

(b) the Contractor shall not be obliged to carry out the installation of counter
equipment in that Outlet under paragraph 5.10.2 abave, but may be required
to do so as Operational Business Change, subject to the normal Operational
Business Change charges applicable to that work.

The above Charges are based on the POCL Services comprised in the Core System
Release. For the avoidance of doubt the payments cover all the Contractor’s costs
relating to all aspects of the Core System, including without limitation maintenance
of the POCL Service Infrastructure, help desk support, all telecoms charges including
line costs and usage charges, and Management Information Systems.

Infrastructure programme in Outlets

In respect of the cost of site preparations in and modifications to Outlets, the
Contractor and POCL have agreed (i) a budget and contributions thereto and (ii) the
allocation of responsibility as to which party is to bear the cost of actual costs

rate of £1,285 per laptop.

To the extent that POCL reasonably requires more than 25 laptops in order to comply
with its obligations under paragraph 7.1 as a result of the distribution of ECCO +
Outlets in the Roll Out Programme, then Pathway shall provide to POCL such
additional laptops at no additional charge.

The Contractor shall provide training for POCL staff and sub-postmasters in the use
of the Core System in accordance with CCN 286(d), as modified to take account of

ANNEX 3 TO SCHEDULE A12
Transaction Metrics for Charges

It is proposed that transactions should be counted for charging purposes according to
the following rules. The default is that 1 customer-facing transaction in reference data
= 1 chargeable transaction. The following are the main exceptions:

Transaction items: 1 chargeable transaction per transcash item. For the avoidance of
doubt, there will be no chargeable transaction associated with the fee payable on the

transcash item,

Postal orders: 1 chargeable transaction per customer session, regardless of number of
postal orders sold. For the avoidance of doubt, there will be no chargeable transaction
associated with the fee(s) payable on the postal order(s), Where postal stamps are
sold to make up the odd amount of a postal order value (e.g. the 27p of a postal order
of value £35.27), these stamps will be counted as a chargeable transaction in
accordance with the metrics for postal stamps (see below).

Phone cards: Sales of phone cards of the same denomination to be rolled up within a
customer session. For example, if a customer buys 2 x £2.00 cards this would be 1
chargeable transaction; however if the customer buys 1 x £2.00 and 1 x £5.00 cards
this would be 2 chargeable transactions.

Saving stamps: 1 chargeable transaction per client, per customer session regardless of
the quantity and combination of saving stamp values sold. For example, if a customer
buys 1 x £2.00 and 2 x £5.00 British Gas saving stamps and 2 x £2.00 BBC licence
stamps this would result in 2 chargeable transactions.

Postage stamps: Sales of postage stamps within a customer session to be rolled up into

1 chargeable transaction regardless of quantity and combinations of stamps sold. For ”
the avoidance of doubt, postage stamps includes definitive and special issue stamps of

all values, stamp books and postage-paid stationery. It does not include other postal

products such as datapost or special delivery. For example, if a customer buys 2 x Ist

class, 42p of other postage, 3 x stamp books (10 x 2nd class) and a book of 10 x Ist

class stamps, this would be 1 chargeable transaction.

Because it is recognised that the volumes of postage stamp sales in the Workload Brief
is subject to statistical uncertainty in deriving the average value of transactions, the
charges will if necessary be adjusted retrospectively as follows:

. The actual average value of stamp sales per transaction will be calculated by
dividing the total value of stamp sales recorded on POCL by the number of
customer sessions in which stamp sales were recorded.

. The intended average value of stamp sales will be calculated as £2.51
multiplied by the average RPI for the relevant invoicing year and divided by the
average RPI for the year ending February 1996.
18

* The adjusted amount payable for postage stamp sale transactions will be
calculated by multiplying the charges by the actual average value and dividing
by the intended average value, any under or over payment will be included as
an adjustment to the next monthly invoice.

e An adjustment factor, to apply in all Operating Fee Periods, will be calculated at
the end of the first Operating Fee Period based on the previous 12 months’ data.

Retail items sold over the post office counter: Charged as 1 transaction per line, ie. 1
item of each of 2 different lines = 2 transactions, 2 of the same line = 1 transaction.

Entry of sales not transacted on the POCL Service Infrastructure: ie. postshop,
vending, lottery etc. Charged as 1 transaction per batch entry for each product (e.g.
60 lottery ticket sales and 60 vending items = 2 transactions),

Reversals: Where transactions are subsequently reversed, the transaction itself will be
chargeable as usual, the reversal will not be chargeable, and any related fresh
transaction will be chargeable.

Use of scales: A price look-up for postage items using the scales link or by manually
keyed input will not count as a separate transaction.

Premium Mails Services: Each item requiring separate entry will count as 1 transaction
(e.g. posting 3 datapost packages which require separate recording). Where items are
entered as multiples (e.g. posting 2 parcels of the same weight with recorded delivery
to the same zone) these will count as a single transaction.

Seales, premium services, and postal order transactions are additional to any related
sale of postage stamps, but no more than 1 postage stamp sale wil] be recorded per
customer session regardless of the use of those stamps.

Order Book Transactions: Each encashed foil shall count as a separate transaction,

Girocheques: Each Girocheque encashed shail count as a separate transaction.

Contractor Responsibilities

The Contractor will be responsible for all site preparation and modification
costs (the “infrastructure programme”) other than those covered by the POCL
contributions pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Annex and for which POCL is to
be responsible pursuant to paragraph 3 of this Annex.

In this Annex, “Modified Total Infrastructure Costs” means the total costs
incurred under the infrastructure programme (excluding payments made or to
be made by POCL pursuant to paragraph 3 of this Annex).

Contributions

Of the first £34 million of the Modified Total Infrastructure Costs, the
Contractor will pay £29 million and POCL will pay £5 million.

The £5 million which POCL is required to pay pursuant to paragraph 2.1 of this
Annex is to be phased over time in proportion to the number of Outlets made
ready for installation. The Contractor and POCL acknowledge that of this £5
million, £512,267 has been allocated to meeting the costs of aborts, suspends
and revisits, relating to site preparation and surveys at any Outlet, and £39,147
has been allocated to meeting the costs of out of hours work for standard sub-
post offices (excluding the 100 largest standard sub-post offices) relating to site
preparation and modifications, together totalling £551,414.

If the agreed forecasts of the Modified Total Infrastructure Costs exceed £34
million, POCL will pay the next £4 million, such payment to be phased pro rata 7
to the number of Outlets installed.

if the Modified Total Infrastructure Costs exceed £38 million POCL and the
Contractor will determine the approximate number of weeks which will be
required to complete the infrastructure programme, and POCL will pay a
further £1 million phased on a weekly basis evenly over the period so
determined for the forecast completion of the infrastructure programme.

If, on the NR Completion Date, the Modified Total Infrastructure Costs are:

2.5.1 less than or equal to £34 million, the Contractor will pay POCL by way
of refund £4 million;

2.5.2 greater than £34 million but less than or equal 10 £38 million, the
Contractor will pay POCL by way of refund an amount equal to £38
million less the Modified Total Infrastructure Costs;

The Contractor shall bear the costs of supplying and installing the necessary
equipment and carrying out the necessary electrical work for new distribution
boards and earthing in the first 10,000 Outlets in which there is a requirement
for such distribution board or earthing work to be carried out. Thereafter POCL
shall bear such costs in accordance with paragraph 13 of Schedule A12.
(Without prejudice to POCLs obligation to bear such costs, an estimated cost to
POCL of £1.1 million for such work has been derived from an estimate that
such work will be required in altogether 14,273 Outlets and that such work in
the final 4,273 of such Outlets will cost on average £257 per Outlet.)

In all cases the Contractor will take responsibility for co-ordinating with the
regional electricity board to carry out final connections to the power supply.
Any charges levied by the regional electricity board will be charged to POCL.”

Cost thresholds

3.3.1 In respect of any Outlet to be modified, where the estimated cost of

i. Service Principles

Pathway will supply all the Office Platform Service equipment
which is required for testing, acceptance and training for
those POCL Services which are provided by Pathway under this
Contract. The charges for such equipment are included in the
Service prices. If additional Office Platform Service equipment
is required by POCL for other purposes, including for example
the testing of Services or systems that are not supplied by
Pathway, then Pathway shall supply such equipment under the
normal commercial terms and prices which are prevailing at the
time.

It should be noted that title to all equipment which is
provided as a part of the contracted POCL Services remains with
Pathway and the equipment will be reassigned to operational use
by Pathway when it is no longer needed for testing.

The following paragraphs provide further details of this
“service principle” as it applies to the examples raised by
POCL.

2. Acceptance Testing:

Pathway will supply the Office Platform Service equipment that
is reasonably required to test and accept new Office Platform
Services provided that it is:

a) vequired in support of the POCL Services provided

exclusively by Pathway and
b) required te satisfy the Acceptance Criteria

3, Destructive Testing:

Upon request by POCL, Pathway will supply sample units of the
Office Platform Service Equipment for destructive testing. The
first sample of each generic type of unit will be provided at
no charge to POCL and any subsequent units will be supplied at
normal commercial prices.

4, Other Testing by POCL:

POCL may require additional Office Platform Service equipment
te support in-house testing or for testing third party
applications, systems or services. Pathway will provide such
Equipment under normal commercial terms and prices.

5. Training:

ICL Pathway will carry out classroom training only. ICL Pathway
will provide the equipment for class room training as part of
national Rollout.

If additional equipment is required by POCL or third parties to
support training which is not undertaken by ICL Pathway then
such equipment will be supplied on normal commercial terms and
prices.

6. Demonstration & Marketing:

Pathway will provide Office Platform Service equipment which is
required to demonstrate and market new Office Platform
Services to clients and prospective clients. The equipment that
is required will be set out in marketing plans which are agreed
jointly between POCL and Pathway.

L. Equipment Livery

Pathway will agree with POCL the standards for equipment livery
to be used within OPS. These standards will reflect the POCL
Style Guide for Post Offices and will be used as the basis for
all equipment installed in all outlets which provide the OPs.

2. Equipment Appearance

The effort required to maintain the OPS equipment will be
minimal and capable of being undertaken by the local post
office staff. It will be comparable to the cleaning required of
any desk-based office computer system and will typically
consist of occasional dusting and screen cleaning. ~

3. Cleaning Materials

Pathway proposes that any cleaning materials that are required
shall be supplied in the same way as for other Consumables.

Pathway Comment

In order to take account of the costs of the livery within the
Tender we shall need early access to the POCL Style Guide for
Post Offices. Pathway anticipates that one aspect of the
standards for equipment livery will be the colour of equipment
casings. Whilst this presents no problems in principle the
earliest definition of the preferred choice will be important
in order that equipment lead times are not affected. Pathway
would wish to supply standard colour equipment into the
Operational Trial phase should post office livery equipment not
be available at that time.

1. Connection of OPS to TMS

The Pathway solution for OPS is based on a PC configuration at
every counter. Each counter configuration is linked to a
Local Area Network within the post office. Bach post office
configuration is linked to TMS over an ISDN Wide Area Network.

This connection supports the transfer of authorised data files
and messages in both directions.

2. Data Transfer

The Pathway solution for TMS uses data replication and
synchronisation techniques to ensure that data transfer between

post office counter positions within OPS and between instances

of OPS and the TMS are secure, complete, accurate and robust. ~
In addition techniques including Cyclic Redundancy Checks,

Digital Signatures and Encryption are used to ensure data
integrity.

2.1 Secure Data Transfer

Once a transaction has been settled at a counter position the
full transaction details are committed to that users journal.
These details are automatically replicated to all other PC’s in
the post office to ensure that the data has been securely
captured. In addition these transaction details are
automatically replicated to a remote server within TMS. Data
and message transfer may originate from an individual counter
PC (e.g. a bill payment} and be replicated to TMS or from a
POCL Client system (e.g. APS Host) which then uses TMS to
distribute data to OPS.

FUJ00000071

FUJ00000071

CODIFIED AGREEMENT SCHEDULE A16 RESTRICTED CONTRACTS

The OPS PCs and TMS servers are known as nodes which are
logically grouped into a number of work groups.

All messages from a single node are generated in a strict
numbered sequence and with a unique node identification. Any
attempt to introduce a fraudulent message will be detected and
rejected.

This approach is resilient to either network or node failure
since a TMS node and an OPS node will be always aware of each
others state. When the failure condition is resolved the nodes
will automatically synchronise and complete any data or message
transfers that are required to ensure both nodes are in a
consistent state.

2.2 Data Integrity

Three techniques are used to ensure data integrity within the
OPS and as part of data/message transfer between OPS and TMS.

These are CRCs used for all node journal messages, DSA based
Digital Signatures used for all data where assurance of content
and source are required and Data Encryption used selectively on
certain data fields.

All messages have a CRC applied when they are initially
committed to the journal and this is checked every time the
message is accessed. This protects against accidental
corruption and casual tampering. Any failure of a CRC check
will cause the message to be rejected and retrieved from an
alternate node.

When authentication of the origin of data is important, a
digital signature is applied to the data prior to transmission
and then checked upon receipt. A CRC is generated for the data
contents, then one-way encrypted and the result encrypted using
a DSA private key. Upon receipt the CRC is recovered using the
public DSA key and compared with the newly encrypted checksum
from the received data. If the results match then the data
content and its origin are assured.

Data encryption may be used selectively to protect the values
of certain data items.

Thus any attempt to alter the data will be automatically
detected and logged for subsequent investigation.

3. Status of TMS data collection

FUJ00000071

FUJ00000071

CODIFIED AGREEMENT SCHEDULE A1é RESTRICTED CONTRACTS

The Pathway solution for TMS and OPS automatically replicates
in the TMS all of the transaction data which is created using
the OPS. The data is then available for processing by the
relevant client system which may include Pathway, POCL or POCL
client systems.

The replication period between OPS and TMS is configurable and
will be defined according to the urgency of the transaction
data. Data replication will also take advantage of connections
that are established between TMS and OPS for other purposes.
E.g. An OBCS transaction etc.

This process runs automatically throughout the day and is
optimised to take advantage of any connections that TMS might
make to OPS. The exact status of transactions from one moment
to the next may be different. Consequently a report
identifying the status of transaction data is felt to have
little business value.

Pathway believes that the key requirement is to ensure that
end-of-day procedures provide TMS with data in a known state
at each post office and enable Client processing to proceed on
a consistent dataset.

The Pathway solution for EPOS will initiate a connection to
replicate the final end-of-day balances and this process will
also enable the replication of any outstanding transactions
that have not previously been sent to TMS.

Pathway's solution draws upon the experience gained by
delivering field services to Camelot’s National Lottery
terminals which are often sited in locations where space is
very limited.

The hardware platform and associated peripherals have been
chosen with minimum maintenance in mind. All faults will be
diagnosed with the aid of expert systems by the Horizon System
Helpdesk and it is anticipated that fewer than 25% of calls
will require a visit by a field engineer to replace an
unserviceable component. It is our experience that the majority
of visits will be completed within 20 minutes of arrival. If

the maintenance or repair operation is predicted to take longer
than 20 minutes then Pathway will replace a whole unit or
module to minimise disruption at the counter.

Optionally, a postmaster may elect to defer a visit to a time
which he believes is more convenient for himself and his
customers. For example, in a larger crown office, if a fault
occurred at the busiest time of day and the postmaster
preferred that the engineer arrived later, or even on a
different day, then he could request a deferred visit. In these
circumstances, the request for service would be diagnosed fully
but then suspended until the preferred appointment time.
Clearly the time in suspension will not count towards down-time
for the purposes of service measurement and performance
targets.

design authority for technical documentation and changes to
them must reside with the Contractor. Pathway is prepared to

which POCL believe must be preserved through changes to the
documentation if this is considered helpful.

Pathway Comment

The requirement only identifies the need for technical
documentation, it does not directly address the related
implications of developing and using third party applications
er hardware on the Contractor's service platform. The
Contractor must ensure that the technical and operational
integrity of the OPS is not compromised by third party
applications or hardware. It will therefore be necessary for
any third party applications or hardware to be verified and
approved by Pathway before installation or connection to the
OPS. In addition to the provision of the technical
documentation, Pathway will support the procurement of third
party Applications or Hardware by offering a design,
Integration, Test and Approval Service. The operational
implications of third party applications and hardware must also
be considered since they will utilise resource capacity of the
OPS and perhaps other related POCL Services. Implementation
and ongoing service management for third party hardware and
applications may be required from the Contractor in many cases.
Pathway is prepared to offer commercially attractive services

1. Broadcast facilities

Pathway will provide a Broadcast facility which will enable
short messages to be sent to all or a subset of outlets from a

central location. The message will be input into an
application running on the central TMS servers and will be
replicated to post offices as required. At the local post

office each counter position can access these messages and
selectively open and view the message. Once a User has read a
message this fact is recorded in the journal.

The user will be prompted that a message is outstanding by an
indicator on the top of their screen. On selecting the Office
Message icon the user will be presented with a list of messages
with an indicator showing their status (read or unread). The
message can be printed as required.

Pathway will need to agree with POCL the precise mechanisms for
enabling messages to be input into the TMS application and on
the method of grouping PO outlets in order to optimise outlet
selection.

2. Access to electronic information

Subject to the comment below, Pathway is able to provide an
electronic information facility so that counter staff using the
OPS are able to gain access to information in support of
counter transactions and for general education and information.
Such information may comprise or be derived from sources
including Counter News, Regional Bulletins or Operations
Manuals.

Pathway will provide a facility which will enable these and
other documents to be distributed to outlets and viewed
locally. The documents would need to be supplied to Pathway in
an agreed format (e.g. HTML). These would be distributed

within the users Riposte desktop.

Pathway will agree with POCL or other Clients the retention
periods for these documents.

Pathway will agree a charging structure for this service which
is expected to be based on file size and incidence of
distribution.

Pathway Comment

Pathway believes that the second part of the requirement
(paragraph 2 above) is complex both for the Contractor and for
POCL who would need to originate the information of electronic
access. It is pointed out that for contingency & fallback
purposes the service documentation must be provided in paper
format anyway and thus two sets of information need to be
maintained incurring additional costs. Pathway would like
further discussions with POCL regarding the business needs. At
present Pathway does not believe the facility is cost
effective.

1. Introduction

Pathway’s solution for the OPS is based on a set of counter
applications running on processors at every counter position.
The counter applications all operate under Riposte, a suite of
software which provides mechanisms for ensuring data security
and integrity within the OPS and across the network to TMS. In
addition Riposte ensures this distributed architecture is fully
resilient by replication of data across the OPS and TMS
together with effective algorithms for synchronisation whenever
the replicates are out of step.

2. Accurate and Robust Data Capture

The design of the counter applications and the menu structures
have been designed to minimise data input and to ensure that
only valid and accurate data is captured at the relevant point
within a counter transaction.

The counter applications will be invoked by an event driven
process wherever possible. This will typically be a card

swipe, a bar code read or optionally a single touch on touch
screen panel. The data associated with these actions will be
captured automatically. Some transactions will require no
further data input and the transaction will be completed by
invoking a Receipt (where required) and the Settle function.

Supporting data may be required for some transactions
including quantity, value or transaction specific details such
as account number. Check-digits will be used where this used

by a particular client transaction.

A running total showing quantity and value of each transaction
is visible on the screen, and any errors can be reversed where
the transaction type allows.

3. Integrity and Security of Data

Once a transaction has been settled the full transaction
details are committed to that users journal and Riposte then
replicates these details to all other PC's in the post office.
In addition the transaction details are replicated to a remote
server within TMS. These PC’s and servers are known as nodes
which form a Riposte workgroup.

All messages from a single Riposte node are generated in strict
sequence and with a unique node identification. The
introduction of an additional stream of messages will be
detected by Riposte and rejected.

Three techniques are used by Riposte to ensure data integrity.
These are CRCs (Character Redundancy Checks) used for all
Riposte journal messages, DSA based Digital Signatures used
for all data where assurance of content and source are required
{i.e. AP records) and Data Encryption used selectively on
certain data fields.

All messages in Riposte have a CRC applied when they are
initially committed to the journal and this is checked every
time the message is accessed. This protects against accidental
corruption and casual tampering. Any failure of a CRC check
will cause the message to be rejected and retrieved from an
alternate node.

When authentication of the origin of data is important (i.e.
for AP records), a digital signature is applied to the data
prior to transmission and then checked upon receipt. A CRC is
generated for the data contents, then one-way encrypted and the
result encrypted using an DSA private key. Upon receipt the
checksum is recovered using the public DSA key and compared

the results match then the data content and its origin are

assured.

Data encryption mechanisms are available and will be used
selectively to protect the values of certain data.

Reference is also made to Pathway’s responses to Risk 65 and
supplementary questions (PWAY065 to PWAYO65c inclusive) which
concern security of data from OPS to TMS, and the Security
Functional Specification.

4, Audit trail

All data captured at a post office counter either as part of a
counter transaction or as an administration function (user
log-on, teller balance) will form part of a unique transaction
which is given a unique reference number by Riposte. The format
of this journal entry will vary according to the transaction
type but will typically contain :-

Post Office ID
Counter Position ID
Unique Transaction ID
Date

Time

User ID

Application
Transaction Details

Each counter PC contains a journal and all journal entries are

automatically replicated to all other members of the workgroup.
This will include all the counter PC’s in the post office and
one of the remote Servers (known as Correspondence Servers)
that form part of the TMS. This Correspondence Server will in
turn replicate all its transactions to two other Correspondence
Servers located on different sites.
Once data is stored in the journal it is never altered. New
transactions are always appended to the journal. Retrieval of
data using a particular key field will retrieve all entries
containing that field and logically determine the overall state
of the transaction data.

A complete audit trail of all transactions and other
significant events is maintained within the post office systems
and is automatically available for analysis by both audit
access facilities and value added services which are linked to
TMS.

The Pathway solution for OPS ensures that data security and
integrity is maintained in the event of failures of the OPS.
Riposte provides synchronisation facilities which will
automatically check the status of the journal for a node when
it is re-established following failure. Should the journal be
out of step (e.g. through failure of the counter PC) Riposte
will automatically synchronise the journal and any data files
to the same state as all other journals in that workgroup.
Synchronisation may occur from another counter PC {in a multi-~-
counter office) or from one of the Correspondence Servers (ina
single counter post office).

The data security features described above are not affected by
this process and no user intervention is required to effect
synchronisation.

1. Remote Access to OPS

Users may only log-on to the OPS in their local post office.
Any access to data or services outside of the local post office
is controlled exclusively by the relevant counter application.

2. User Access to OPS

Authentication of all users logging on to the OPS in the post
office is undertaken by the OPS operating system. Full access
control and password management facilities are provided. The
OPS uses this information to ensure that only authorised staff
are allowed access to applications, and then only to those
applications for which they have permission. Each user is
identified by a unique password. The procedure for logging-on
to the OPS is described in the Counter Operations Procedures
manual.

In order that a specific role for POCL Auditors can be created
Pathway will need to understand the specific functions that are
required to be associated with this role and where these are
different from the Post master. The normal user hierarchy
would place the Postmaster as the most privileged user with a
series of roles and lesser permission levels subservient to
this.

If specific functions are required for Audit that are not
availazle to the Post master, then the Audit user would require
an incependent method of setting the password. In this
situation the approach outlined below for lost password and
linked to the Audit user would be used.

3. Restricted Functionality

Agreement will be required on the POCL Services (e.g. AP etc.)
that are to be provided at an outlet. Where it is known that a
POCL Service will never be required in an outlet, then the
counter applications reference data will not include that POCL
Service. Where an existing POCL Service might be required in
particular outlets in the future, access to the applications
will be disabled from the user desktop by means of reference
data.

In addition it will be possible to restrict certain transaction
types in an outlet (e.g. no MVL sales). This will be achieved
by disabling the appropriate entry within the desktop through
reference data.

Pathway understand that service or functionality provision /
non-provision is determined at the outlet level, and is not
directly related to User Access.

4, Lost Password

The OPS will provide facilities to enable the Postmaster to
establish new users and set an initial password for all users
in his/her post office. Should a user forget their password
the Postmaster can reset the password. The same procedure
applies at single counter position post offices and multiple
counter position post offices.

For situations where the sole user (e.g. Postmaster in a

single counter office) has lost his password, the OPS will
provide the facility to generate a unique key as part of the
log on to a specific username (e.g. user SETUP). This will be
phoned to the Horizon System Helpdesk who will provide the
corresponding key which when input to OPS will allow access to
the administration facilities. The user may then reset his
user password.

5. Suspend and Resume

A facility which enables users to securely suspend their
current session and then to resume the session is provided as

invoked by the user using a specific keystroke (e.g. Control +
Key} and may be performed at any time providing that there is
mo counter transaction in progress, or where the transaction
integrity may be compromised by allowing a suspension (e.g.
part way through a smart card transaction). The suspended
session may be resumed by the user entering his password.

1. With respect to those requirements at paragraph 2 above,
which require adherence to “subsequent legislation and

equipment would apply only in circumstances that the subsequent
legislation demanded such action. We believe that this is the
intended meaning.

L. Terminology

For control purposes Pathway believe, that the definition of
reference data should be refined to discriminate between
Business Reference Data which is essential to the POCL
businesses and Operational Reference Data which is controlled
by Pathway and is relevant to the management of the Contractors
Services.

2. Control of Releases

iy
be

Release Principles

POCL require that the Contractor shall undertake the delivery
of the POCL Services to meet demanding business requirements.
Failure to meet contracted performance targets will incur
performance penalties. In order to deliver POCL Services which
meet the contracted requirements and performance levels at an
economic price it is essential that the Contractor is empowered
to manage the all aspects of POCL Service delivery and this
must include the control of new releases. Pathway recognises
that POCL has a legitimate interest in the business functions
that are provided by the POCL Service and needs to be assured
that the quality of the delivered systems meets the contracted
requirements. The processes, tests and quality reviews which
are required will be open to POCL and Pathway will particularly
seek active participation in tests of business functionality

and the Human Computer Interface. It is recommended that
Pathway takes complete responsibility for the management of
releases in line with the contractual commitments requested by
POCL

This section continues with further explanation of the above
principle as it applies to the headings provided in the
requirement.

2.2 Release Contents

Pathway recommends that the content of a release should require
the agreement of POCL with respect to the introduction of new
POCL Services or the deletion of existing POCL Services or
changes to existing POCL Services which affect the essential
business functions of POCL. All such changes to POCL Services
should be initiated through contract change control.

For the reasons which are set out above Pathway should retain
clear responsibility for all other changes to release contents.
Such changes may be justified for many reasons but including
for example: contract compliance, quality, technical strategy
and cost control.

- 2.3 Release Distribution Timing

Pathway believes that there is only one circumstance when POCL
should determine the timing of the distribution of new
releases. That is when a new Client is connected to the POCL
Service for the first time. In all other circumstances the
control of the distribution of releases should be at the
discretion of the Contractor.

2.4 Release Activation Timing

Pathway recommends that the timing of release activation should
require the agreement of POCL with respect to the introduction
cf new POCL Services or the deletion of existing POCL Services
or changes to existing POCL Services which affect the essential
business functions of POCL. This includes the release of the
Business Reference Data which is referred to in Section 1
above. All such changes to POCL Services should be initiated
through contract change control and it is anticipated that any
particular favourable or unfavourable times for the activation
of releases will be declared in the change request.

Pathway believes that in all other circumstances the
responsibility for the timing of the activation of new releases
should be at the discretion of the Contractor.

3. Release Testing

Pathway will provide evidence that the each release has been
tested so that it is shown to meet the Service requirements and
service levels. POCL will be invited to participate in those
tests associated with proving business functionality and Human
Computer Interface aspects of new releases. Other evidence will
be provided in the form of written test reports and invitations
to attend quality review meetings. Evidence of testing for
major releases of new software and functionality will be
provided at the levels of:

Unit Tests

System Test

Representative combinations of hardware and software.
The release testing strategy above is too heavy for testing
minor releases of software or for reference data and
appropriate procedures will be defined for different classes of
release.

4. Preparation For Release

Pathway will complete the testing of major new releases in
three steps prior to full distribution of major new releases.
These are:

A Test conducted in a simulated post office and operated by
real and representative POCL users.

A test of implementation and live operation in a limited
number of post offices for a limited period before general
distribution.

A test of reversion to the previous release.

The release testing strategy above is too heavy for testing
minor releases of software or for reference data and
appropriate procedures will be defined by Pathway for different
classes of release.

5. No Disruption to Users and the Working Environment

Releases of software and and/or reference data will be
distributed across the network and therefore will require
minimal user involvement and no significant disruption tc users
or to the working environment.

6. No Corruption to POCL Data

The data within software and/or reference data is protected at
source by a CRC check Key which is applied by the Riposte

system. Following distribution of the release, the CRC is
checked to ensure that no corruption of the data has taken
place. The release of software and/or reference data will not
cause any corruption to data held on behalf of POCL.

7. Record of Releases

A record of the release of software and reference data which
is in use at each post office will be maintained under
configuration control within an asset data base which is
maintained by Pathway.

Pathway Comment

In responding to requirement at paragraph 2, item {(b) we have
assumed that “the upgrade path for any release “ means new
releases beyond the next release. It is apparent that other
interpretations of the meaning are possible.

lL. The Pathway solution for TMS will link into each instance
of OPS that is to be used for production work using an ISDN
network.

2. TMS supports links into other computer systems through
client-specific TMS software Agents. These Agents will reside
on the TMS servers and will manage any client specific data
manipulation and communications links. Pathway will provide
those Agents required to support those host systems provided as
part of the overall Pathway solution.

The specification for additional Agents required to provide
links from TMS to other computer systems, including POCL’s own
systems and those of POCL’s clients, will be agreed jointly
between Pathway and POCL.

3. Data file collection and delivery

3.1 TMS supports the distribution and collection of electronic
data to and from the OPS. This is achieved by the automatic
replication of transactions from the OPS in a post office to a
TS server. Similarly data provided to TMS from a host system
is replicated to a set of OPS systems in post offices.

3.2 These processes may be initiated by :-

Operator action - This will comprise the normal operational
activities in managing the data transfer from Pathway host
systems to TMS, or will comprise the normal actions of the
counter clerk in carrying out transactions on OPS.

Once a datafile has been passed to TMS or a counter transaction
has been committed within OPS the collection/delivery of this
data is automatic.

Time - The time interval between data replication from OPS to
TMS may be set according to the urgency of the transaction.
Pathway’s solution will optimise any network connection made
from TMS to OPS in a post office by replicating any accumulated
transactions to TMS.

External message - The requirement for an attached computer
system to initiate a data file collection or delivery will be
met by the functionality specified within the relevant TMS
Agent.

TMS initiated - The Pathway solution for TMS automatically
provides data collection / delivery to and from OPS.

3.3 The Pathway solution for TMS automatically replicates data
between TMS and OPS, and between individual PC’s within a post
office OPS. Following a failure of either a TMS node or an OPS
node, TMS will automatically synchronise the restored node to
an up-to date state. This will include any data file or
transaction collection/deliveries that are outstanding.

The recovery facilities available for file transfer between TMS
and an attached computer systems will be dependent on the
precise method of connection and the protocols and file
transfer standards that are used. These will be jointly agreed
between Pathway and POCL as part of the specification for
connecting an attached computer system.

3.4 A TMS node contains a configuration file which
specifically defines the OPS nodes with which it can exchange
data. File transfers to/from attached computer systems will be
controlled by Pathway operational procedures and by the
facilities provided in the jointly specified file transfer
method.

4, Messaging capability
4.1 Messaging Switching

TMS will generally provide the facility to pass messages from
one attached computer system to another. Such message transfer
will be predefined in that message format, source and
destination, verification and service levels will have been
previously agreed between Pathway and other appropriate
organisations.

Pathway anticipate that this requirement is principally aimed
at enabling communication between OPS and other attached Client
host systems in support of future counter applications (e.g.
links between post offices and DNS to support a savings
product).

Subject to the comments below, Pathway is able to develop a
facility which enables messages created in one post office to
be sent via TMS to another post office. A counter application
will enable authorised Users to create messages and address
them to another post office using the FAD code / name. A TMS
agent will periodically extract these messages and forward them
to their destination using a centrally managed directory.

4,2 Message non-delivery

The TMS message Agent would monitor all message-read messages
that are created by post offices and at periodic intervals
{typically at end of day) reconcile messages sent with messages
read. Any non-read messages would result in an advisory
message being sent to the originator.

4.3 File processing

Pathway’s solution for TMS separates the generic functions of
secure and highly resilient transaction management from the
client specific requirements for data file processing.

The former are provided as generic facilities for all
transactions. The latter are provided in the form of TMS
software Agents which are designed to perform specific
functions in support of the links and data processing required
for individual host systems.

To facilitate the development of these Agents Pathway will
supply a set of generic Agents which will form the basis for
different forms of host system interaction.

These will include :-

File Distribution - the acquisition of data from client systems
and the creation of files for distribution

Client Processing - the collection and formatting of
transactions for host systems and the transfer of data to/from
host systems

On-Line - enabling an on-line connection to be made from OPS
via TMS to a host system

The generic facilities provided by the Pathway Agents will be
customised for each specific host system link and will provide
the following facilities :-

-~ validation of data files

- consolidation of many data files into one data file

- generating many data files from one data file

~ reformatting the contents of a data file

- generating control totals through access to the contents of
data files

- reconciliation of control totals

~ produce reports summarising financial transactions

5. All events that occur either in TMS or in OPS are written
to a journal. These journal messages include all the data
required to uniquely identify the user, the location, the
transaction and the date/time of the transaction. Data, once
written to the journal, can never be altered. Information in
the journal is available for analysis as required.

6. The facilities that ensure data transfer in TMS is secure,
complete, accurate and robust are described in Pathway’s
response to requirement 467.

Pathway Comment

Pathway believes that the post office-to-post office messaging
capability (paragraph 5 above) expressed in this requirement is
complex having many characteristics in common with a full E-
mail service, including for example the need for directory
services. The requirement could incur significant costs when
applied to 20,000 offices. We believe that the Message
Broadcast facility which is described at requirement 471 may
meet many of the POCL needs. Pathway would like further
discussion with the POCL regarding the business needs. At
present Pathway does not believe the facility is cost
effective.

2. Authorised Connections
2.1 TMS connections to OPS

The Pathway solution for TMS is based on a network of servers
which connect to the Pathway OPS equipment in each post office
using ISDN or frame relay. Configuration files are initially
established on each TMS server which restrict its connection to
a fixed set of other computer systems. These will be the
other TMS servers to which data is replicated and a defined
set of post office gateway PC’s. These form the servers
workgroup. Data replication and message transfer will only
eccur within this workgroup.

supplementary questions (PWAY065 to PWAYO65c inclusive) which
concern security of data from OPS to TMS, and the Security
Functional Specification.

2.2 TMS connections to Host Systems

Systems which are provided as part of the overall Pathway
solution including for example MIS and System Management will
be connected to the TMS using network links. Pathway will
establish these systems in secure areas and no unauthorised
hosts system will be connected to these networks.

The physical network addresses of these host systems will be
contained in the configuration files of the TMS servers to
prevent unauthorised access. It is Pathway’s intention to
exploit Closed User Groups when these become available from the
network supplier.

3. Identity Authentication

The authentication of computer systems connecting to TMS is
dependant on the protocol used to support the connection to
each Client system and the security facilities that it
supports.

The Pathway solution for linking TMS to OPS uses ISDN. The TMS
and OPS systems will use Call Line Identification to provide
assurance that the calling system is from a valid number.

Pathway will be pleased to work with POCL to design solutions
for Identity Authentication as new Client systems require
connection to TMS.

Pathway will provide reports to POCL of any rejected attempts
of other computer systems to link to TMS on request.

CODIFIED AGREEMENT SCHEDULE Al6 RESTRICTED CONTRACTS

Pathway Response

Pathway would ordinarily expect to agree any future upgrades of
the OPS equipment with POCL. However, it should be recognised
that the Contractor is required to deliver service outputs
against demanding service descriptions, service levels and
liquidated damages. It is possible that at some future time
that the substitution of equipment is required either to meet
the contracted requirements or to achieve cost reductions. It
is not consistent with the proposed form of contract that POCL
should retain a right of veto over the substitution of
equipment by the Contractor and Pathway requests that such
agreement shall not unreasonably be withheld.

Pathway Comment

Pathway’s response is consistent with the assumption that POCL
require a complete managed service contract which is under
written by remedies. If this remains the POCL objective then it
is critical that the Contractor be empowered to manage the
contract so as to deliver the contracted service outputs. If on
the other hand POCL require to participate in the day to day
operational management of the POCL Services then other
contractual arrangements should be considered and discussed

Pathway has proposed to implement EPOS as previously requested

that it cannot inadvertently be used/misused to the detriment
of customer service and POCL accounting needs. POCL can
determine the products and functionality accessible to the
counter clerk by POCL Reference Data and by menu hierarchy
changes.

Pathway Comment

It is not possible to underwrite the operational implications -
of this approach without discussion and clarification. For
example, stock accounting and cash accounting are understood to

be of operational importance to the post office and are
dependant upon the EPOS to collect data from the individual
transactions. In deferring the EPOS do the Authorities intend

to defer the availability of these operational features?

The Pathway strategy for System Management will comprises a set
of services as follows:

Software repository - the storage and maintenance of records
identifying what software versions are stored on what machines.

Software distribution - the scheduling of software upgrades to
a defined set of machines.

Event management - the notification of significant events to a
central source.

CODIFIED AGREEMENT SCHEDULE Al6é RESTRICTED CONTRACTS

Asset management - the storage and maintenance of information
on the existence / type of machines and associated peripherals.

Configuration management - the non-static configuration
parameters that drive the applications and operating system.
This includes Resource Monitoring and Network Management

In the delivery of these System Management activities as
applied to services provided to POCL, the operational
procedures developed and the technology applied will be
exploited to achieve the required quality attributes including
consistency, accuracy, reliability, speed and agility in
responding to failures.

For example some of these services provide dynamic information
on the state of operating entities - such as applications and
operating systems. Event management is such a service.
Coherence and consistency within a homogenous set of
applications and operating system is achieved through standard
naming conventions for the identification of applications and
standard methods of invoking the event are obeyed. This will
allow for example selected events to automatically raise help
calls pro-actively thus initiating a corrective action
response,

Furthermore a consistent approach to event management populates
the Help knowledge database with reliable information such that
further similar incidents can be recognised and resolved.

By contrast other services manipulate by comparison various
static data such as the existence of machines and software
packages stored on these machine against the current
configuration parameters associated with these packages. Again
a common naming standard for this persistent data will be
adopted to achieve consistency and coherency.

As such we have opportunities to engineer coherence and
consistency at a meta level above, for example, specific types
of operating systems. The delivery of this information will be
in databases at the central systems. These will contain a
consolidated central view of the overall system and from this
logical view we can derive {( and automatically deliver) the
parameters required to drive the applications and sub-systems
that work together to deliver the required functionality.

Pathway can thus ensure that if a common configuration is
required for all instances of an application then that
configuration is uniquely defined in the central database or
where the configuration of different applications share common

1. The overall Pathway solution comprises a set of central
host systems together with a number of TMS servers. These
servers will be installed in two data centres, each having the
capability to provide all the services. The post office
network comprises a PC configuration at every counter position.

When the central systems are installed rigorous operational
procedures will ensure that all system data, including date and

time, are consistent. The systems management service will
have the facility to interrogate all servers to check for a
consistent date/time. This will typically be done whenever

there is a need to replace equipment, whenever a general clock
change occurs, and as part of regular system housekeeping.

The counter PC’s will have their date/time set prior to
installation in a post office, or prior to any replacement.
Upon installation a link will be established to the central TMS
and System Management Service to download configuration details
and other data.

Facilities within TMS will automatically synchronise the time -
between TMS servers and also with the counter PC’s.

2. Time changes due to British Summer Time

The TMS and OPS systems will be based on Windows-NT. This
operating system has automatic algorithms for handling clock
changes due to BST. No user action is required.

3. Local Time and GMT

Pathway understand that the requirement for using local time
may arise with certain AP transactions. In this case any
adjustments for particular AP transactions would be handled
within the AP application. Pathway will require a description
of which transactions are affected and the nature of the
adjustment.

1. Maintenance of reference data

Pathway will support and maintain both system and application
related reference data for an outlet. System related data
comprises information that relates to the state of the outlet
and its associated software base (e.g. event management
details, software version numbers).

Application related data comprises information that relates to
particular transactions

(e.g. price of a stamp, check digit algorithm for an AP
client).

1.1 Maintenance of System related reference data

The Pathway Systems Management Service will use Tivoli TME to
provide the functions required to store and maintain reference
data and to manage its distribution and activation. This will
comprise a single Asset and Configuration database which
provides a central logical view of which systems are associated
with which versions of various files, including reference data.
Pathway will use rigorous change management processes to
control the rate and nature of changes to the software
inventory and these will involve a co-ordinated approach with
the originator of any external data including POCL and external ~
clients.

The Tivoli supports a central repository, which will contain
various objects including reference data, together with a
supporting distribution infrastructure.

The distribution infrastructure comprises the components that
move those files that constitute a single software package and
also the instructions that prescribe how the package is to be
installed.

The software package is stored on a number of TME Management
servers at each Pathway central site. A Tivoli Software
Distribution job will invoke the distribution of data, such as
new reference data to those sites that require it, and Tivoli
Client Software residing on the client system will interpret

the instructions from the Management server and install the
software as required.

1.2 Maintenance of Application related reference data

Reference data supplied to Pathway by POCL and/or POCL clients
will be stored and maintained in Pathway's Central Reference
Data Base system. Agreement will be required on the process
and form by which reference data is supplied to Pathway and the
supporting control and validation processes.

In addition each item of reference data will need to be
associated with a class of post offices, which will have
previously been defined, in order to support the distribution
process,

This information will then be processed, as determined by the
effective date of the new or changed reference data, and
introduced to TMS. TMS will then distribute the data where it
will be activated and held within the outlet as a permanent
object.

2. Use of external reference data

Pathway recognise that some reference data will be provided
from external systems (e.g. TIP and client systems). Pathway
will agree the precise form and process by which this
information is made available to Pathway’s software
distribution services with the relevant owner. Operational and
technical procedures will be agreed which will ensure the
integrity of data transfer, data verification and activation
procedures.

3. Implementation timescales

Pathway recognise that some reference data items may be subject
to a fast implementation (e.g. as required by a Budget change).
Pathway do not anticipate any significant difficulties with
distributing and activating these changes, as the normal
process would achieve this overnight. Agreement will be needed
on the method of providing such changes to Pathway.

Pathway Comment

An indication of the different forms of reference data and
their owners would assist in the development of the operational
procedures.

1. Environmental Considerations

An important factor in Pathway’s selection of equipment
suppliers for OPS has been their approach to environmental
considerations particularly in the materials policy, production
processes and recycling.

Key considerations are that the products should not contain
materials that endanger the user when used in the post office
environment, and that the manufacturing process avoids the use
of toxic emissions and has the capability to recycle as much of
the product materials as possible.

One of the key components in the CPS is the PC and Pathway
have selected ICL as the supplier. IcL is committed to
protecting every part of the environment by compliance with
existing environmental legislation and anticipating future
moves such as the TCO 6H scheme. Some examples include :-

ICL stopped using PVC many years ago in favour of ABS for the
plastic casings. This avoids the problem of hydrochloric acid
formation when the PVC plastic is burnt. Other components such
as the keyboard also use ABS for the plastic casing and all
components are selected for their ability to be recycled.

Brominated flame retardants have not been used since 1989.

Only capacitors that do not contain PCB and batteries that
are cadmium-free are used.

The majority of the components of the PC can be recycled and
used for making other goods. All plastic parts are labelled
with the type material they are composed of.

Where ICL has responsibility for equipment disposal, the
following process is followed. All parts suitable for spare
parts are removed and reprocessed. The scrap is roughly sorted
into metals, precious metals , glass and plastics. Batteries
and some other items are sent for special treatment. All
metals are processed by specialist firms. ABS plastics are
stored at present awaiting the development of suitable re-
cycling process. All cathode ray tubes go to an aluminium
factory for crushing and, after washing, the crushed glass is
dumped.

The production process for the electronic circuit boards
requires that the PCB‘s are washed to remove metal chips and
chemical residues. This process does not use either CFC
compounds or Preon based detergents due to the environmental
harm these chemicals can cause. All PCBs are washed in mild

detergent prior to component soldering. The precious metals
are separated from the soldering machine tin ash for reuse.

The equipment is packed in cardboard boxes with styrox
packaging which can be burnt without harmful effects. A self
closing box eliminates the need for glue, tape or staples.

Pathway will comply with all relevant environmental legislation
and will generally exercise a responsibility for “Duty of
Care”.

1. TMS scalability

Pathway have submitted a paper to POCL which addresses Risk 9 -
the scalability of the central TMS facilities. Ref: Risk
pwyoooo0s - Part 3, version 2 dated 158/12/95.

The analysis in this paper shows that there are no constraints
on the scaling of the central TMS service or of the underlying
network infrastructure to meet the workload volumes projected.
The modular nature of TMS and the network enables additional
system resources to added to accommodate any workload growth.

Monitoring of traffic patterns and actual system resource usage
will be undertaken during operational trials and early system
usage. This will be used to ensure the optimum deployment of
the TMS components.

2. Future transaction requirements

Pathway recognise and support POCL’s strategy to introduce new
business transactions and understand that these may require
access to central host systems for authorisation or data
access/update. An example of this type of transaction is in
operation now in An Post {an on-line Savings system) and
Pathway would implement such links using a TMS agent to provide
the specific Client data exchanges.

i. Transaction committal

AP transactions using smart tokens will be committed to the
local journal as soon as they have been completed. Other AP
transactions will be committed at the end of the customer
session which may include other non-AP transactions.

A non-smart AP transaction once completed may not be voided
within the session in which it took place even though it is
not committed to the journal until the end of the session.
This is because a receipt will have been printed at the time of
the transaction. Should it be necessary to reverse the
transaction then this may be achieved using ordinary reversal
facilities in a subsequent session.

This process will occur when :-

(i) monies have been accepted

(ii) a transaction has been reversed. It should be noted
that the original transaction is never altered and that any
subsequent and related transactions are added to the journal.

There will be a limited time within which a reversal can take
place and this is expected to be contained within one business
day for the post office.

The process will operate to the rules described in :-

1. APS fallback strategy

The Pathway solution for the Automated Payments Service
comprises a counter application and supporting peripherals
which operate within the overall OPS counter applications
environment. Each post office counter is equipped with a PC
configuration and each configuration runs its own copy of the
AP application and has its own set of supporting peripherals.

The failure conditions that will affect the ability of a post
office to provide the AP service are limited to the failure of
a PC at a single counter post office, and the failure of the
Smart Card / Smart Key reader at a counter.

The distributed nature of the Pathway solution means that a
single counter failure in a multiple counter post office will
not affect their ability to provide an AP service from the
remaining counters. the provision of the AP service is not
affected by a failures that may occur in either central systems
or the network.

1.1 Single Counter PC failure

A single counter PC failure will result in the post office
providing a manual AP service for transactions supported by
magnetic card or by a paper bill. Magnetic card supported
transactions will be recorded by a card imprinter (zip-zap)
onto a two-part AP voucher. Paper supported transactions will
be recorded by retaining the paper bill.The post office copy
of this voucher will be used by the post master to enter the
transaction using a suitable data entry facility when the post
office counter is restored to service.

1.2 Smart Card/Smart Key failure

Last saved 21/07/99 15:51
FUJ00000071

FUJ00000071

CODIFIED AGREEMENT SCHEDULE A16é RESTRICTED CONTRACTS

No Smart Card/Key transactions can take place until the failed
unit is replaced.

1.3 Failure probability and impact

Failure Incidence Impact

Total loss of PC at single counter post office. The failure
rate of the PC is 4 hours outage every 1200 days, assuming the
PC is not turned off. This equates to one failure per counter
every four years. Manual AP vouchers will have to be produced
using the zip-zap system or manual transcription. Data from
the post office copy of these vouchers will be used to enter
the transaction details locally.

Loss of Smart Card reader at a counter. The failure rate of the
Smart Card reader is one fail every 300,000 reads or 4 hours
outage every 1800 days. This equates to one fail per counter

every six years. See note below.{(assuming 50k reads per
counter per year - Scenario 3 year 2000/01 - Workload Brief
version 1.2) No Smart-Card transactions can take place while

the reader is awaiting replacement.

Note: The scenario described is that of a combined Magnetic
card/Smart card reader, such that any fail will require a whole
unit replacement.

Applying these failure rates to the workload volumes provided
in the Workload Brief gives the following.

Pc failure Smart Card failure

Year 1996/97 Scenario 1: 76 manual vouchers produced per day;
0.0022 % of total / day; 59 transactions not possible; 0.0009 &
of total / day.

Year 2000/01 Scenario 5 (BA) and Scenario 4 (POCL): 367 manual
vouchers produced per day; 0.0075 &% of total / day; 422
transactions not possible; 0.0019 % of total / day.

2. Recovery to a known state

The Pathway AP counter application does not complete a
transaction until the data is known to have been committed to
the local journal. The User is always fully aware of whether a
transaction is complete or not. All transactions, once
committed to the Users local journal are replicated te all
other PC’s in the post office and to the central TMS server.
When a failed unit is replaced it will automatically
synchronise with other nodes in its workgroup and restore all
previous transactions.

FUJ00000071

FUJ00000071

CODIFIED AGREEMENT SCHEDULE Al6é RESTRICTED CONTRACTS

3. Data Corruption

All transaction details are recorded in the users local journal
and are appended with a CRC. This is checked every time the
record is accessed and in the event that the record has become
corrupt it will be discarded and retrieved from another node
within the post office or from the TMS servers.

4. Lost transaction data

It is not possible for transaction data to be lost within the
Pathway solution for OPS or any of the applications it
supports. Transactions once committed to a users local journal
are automatically replicated to other nodes in the post office
and the central TMS system. Any nodes which have to be
replaced are automatically re-synchronised from other nodes
within the post office or the central TMS service.

5. Re-Input of transaction data

The Pathway solution for AP will only require manual
transactions to be created should a single counter
configuration fail. Manually recorded AP transactions will be

input to the AP system once the OPS is re~established.

Magnetic Card supported transactions may be input using details
from the receipt. They would be recorded as a keyed entry.

Smart Card/Key transactions cannot take place when a single
counter PC has failed.

6. Data Recovery

Data recovery, or synchronisation, takes place automatically
following the replacement of a counter PC. There will be no
loss of service on any of the other configurations in the post
office while this takes place.

7. Receipts for recovered transactions

The AP system need not produce a receipt for any recovered
transactions.

8. Validation Rules for recovered transactions

The AP system will conform to the POCL APS generic rules.

1. In general, the outstanding customer session balance can
be settled by a single MoP or a combination of two or more MoPs
(e.g. part cash and part cheque).

EPOSS will be capable of enforcing a set of rules for a
transaction which will determine whether that transaction must
be settled and committed in its own right. For example, a DNS
savings account deposit transaction can be considered to be
committed when the passbook entry is made and stamped. This
suggests that the settlement should be an intrinsic part of the
DNS transaction.

EPOSS will be able to enforce a set rules for any transaction
which will determine the MoPs allowed for that transaction.

2. EPOSS will allow the introduction of new types of MoP by
implementing the MoPs in a generic manner similar to other
products/transactions. As such, EPOSS will allow new MoPs to
be introduced dynamically via reference data.

3. EPOSS will be capable of implementing EFTPOS, handling
debit cards, as a method of payment. EPOSS will have the
inherent capability to handle both debit and credit cards from
the start of the EFTPOS service.

The volumes quoted, while not surprisingly high, are
nevertheless high in absolute terms and will generate
considerably higher daytime telecommunications costs for the
contract services as a whole.

It is understood that cashback will not be required initially
but might become a requirement in the future. EPOSS will
ensure that cashback can be implemented as and when it is
required.

Pathway recommends Girobank as the preferred supplier of the
“Merchant Acquirer” services for EFTPOS. On-line authorisation

will also be transmitted via TMS.

EPOSS will provide daily reconciliation of its EFTPOS
transactions against information from the banking/financial
clients.

Pathway will consider the storage and access requirements for
signed receipts and will propose a preferred approach shortly.
Currently, Pathway favours the storage of signed receipts
centrally by Girobank as an additional service to the Post
Offices, The storage and retrieval procedures will take into
account the 0.2% receipt retrievals anticipated.

The options for the implementation of EFTPOS are currently
under consideration and will be presented separately on
finalisation.

The general benefits of transactions involving EFTPOS are
expected to include:

increased average value of transactions and increased value
of single transactions such as catalogue (e.g. Argos) sales

increased number of transactions - due to attraction of
cashback

inerease number of customers from higher socio-economic group

earlier payment of MVLs, bills etc.

payment of bills at counters which currently require cash at
the counter or a cheque by post. E.g. Giro transcash foils with
“Cheque NOT Acceptable at PO Counter”

reduced handling costs (compared to cheques)

reduced clearing time (compared to cheques)

Pathway Comment

70% {at £15 floor limit) on-line authorisation seems high and
may result in annoying delays and lengthy queues. Girobank
state that £15 limit is a Switch rule and that VISA and
Mastercard are higher.

Girobank state that card scheme rules preclude cash withdrawal
at retail counters (including post office counter) but cashback
is allowed.

2. The number of stock units and their setup will be under
the control of the manager of the Outlet as part of the office
administration functions. EPOSS will provide facilities for

creating and deleting stock units as well as setting stock unit
“sharable” attribute to cater for local working practices.

3. The stock unit management facility will allow changes to
stock unit options and assignments.

4. EPOSS will allow stock unit sharing where a stock unit is
attached to more than one user at the same time. This will be
optional so that sharable and non-sharable stock units can be
used within the same Outlet.

5. EPOSS will allow each stock unit to be balanced as often
as is required within a cash account week. Balancing will
involve the declaration of cash and stock by denomination.

Sharing a stock unit results when it is attached to more than
one user at the same time. When sharing a stock unit, a group
of users will be able to divide the administrative functions
amongst themselves. For example, the declaration of cash and
stock on hand can be carried out by each user. Bach
declaration will represent that user’s proportion of the total
for the stock unit. The aggregated total for the stock unit
will be used for subsequent balancing operations on the stock
unit.

6. EPOSS will allow an office balance to be produced at the

The audit trail comprises information corresponding to the POCL
Infrastructure Service together with its Systems Management

distribution and remote operations.

Consistent identity of file, record and field will be
maintained.

The pOCL Infrastructure Service element of the audit trail

1. All transactions that pass through TMS are recorded in the
journal. The journal will be maintained on magnetic media
within TMS for a period currently planned to be 90 days.
Following this the journal data will be archived to optical
storage. The current or archived TMS journals can be accessed
to provide an audit trail of all TMS transactions.

Some fallback scenarios will still be capable of recording a
transaction in the TMS journal, e.g. keyed entry of card.
Other scenarios will require data capture by alternate means
and subsequent introduction to the TMS journal (e.g. manual AP

transaction details will be entered by the postmaster locally
when the OPS is restored to service. Data captured during such
fallback situations in the TMS journal can be accessed to
provide an audit trail.

The distributed nature of the Pathway TMS enables an Audit
trail to be maintained and accessed during any recovery of a
TMS server.

2. The audit trail provided by the TMS journal will record
all file transfers, messaging or transactions, and the
processing that originated these messages.

3. Transactions recorded in the TMS journal will contain
some standard information and then variable data depending on

the process that originated them.

Standard data will include :-

each will contain the same unique session ID to identify that
they occurred as one set of customer transactions at the
counter. Each transaction will also record data specific to
that transaction.

Transactions are then replicated to the central TMS and are
subsequently extracted for processing and dispatch to a variety
of host systems (e.g. POCL, POCL-Client systems). Bach
transaction will retain the attributes that enable its source
and any associated transactions to be identified (e.g.
transaction ID, session ID etc.). This data may be
interrogated, subject to agreed procedures with Pathway, at any
point in this process from

transaction origination in an Outlet to Client specific
datafiles just prior to dispatch.

5. Data recorded in the journal will be sufficient to allow a
transaction to be recreated. Pathway will be pleased to
discuss the recording of any specific data items that may be
required by POCL.

6. The content of the audit trail will be agreed between
Pathway and POCL.

7. Audit trail records will provide information for a period
consistent with the Companies Act

8. Pathway will provide POCL with reasonable access to the
audit trail provided by the TMS journal.

9. Once transactions are written to the TMS journal they can
never be altered or deleted.

10. TMS comprises a number of servers separated across two
geographically remote sites. The service is resilient against
the loss of individual servers or of a complete site.

Data within TMS is replicated within the local data centre and
to the remote datacentre. When failed servers or a complete
site is restored, all transactions are synchronised to bring
each server up to date. The TMS service continues operating
during this process.

Should both data centres supporting the TMS servers fail, the
Outlets would continue largely unaffected. Transactions (OBCS,
AP and EPOS transactions) would continue in each Outlet and be
recorded in the local journal. When the central TMS is
restored synchronisation would take place with each Outlet to
bring the central TMS up to date.

11. It will be possible to provide a suitable legal assurance
as to the integrity of the audit trail.

12. Any changes to the POCL Services provided by Pathway will
be the subject of discussion and agreement with POCL.
Technological change may be one of the implications of a
service change (e.g. the introduction of a new counter
peripheral). The ability to maintain the facilities associated
with audit will be one of the acceptance criteria governing
the introduction of any change. In the event that the audit
trail medium becomes obsolete it will be securely copied to a
medium that will be serviceable for the required lifetime of
the content.

The Systems Management function

The Systems Management Service provides a repository for the
recording of all physical events affecting the platforms which
support the POCL Infrastructure Service, that is TMS and the
OPS. All these environments operate under Windows NT and are
managed from the Tivoli Management Servers. Tivoli provides,
in conjunction with the native Windows NT and messaging
middleware services, a comprehensive facility for trapping,
recording and interrogating audit events relating to the
operational status of the hardware, software and applications
running within the POCL Infrastructure Service.

Tivoli auditing features enable the recording of events such as
which users access which objects, what type of access in being
attempted and whether or not the attempt was successful.
Administrative privilege is required for controlling and
accessing audit files within Tivoli.

Audit events may be viewed through a Tivoli interactive
bulletin board with appropriate access security measures, or
may be accessed by applications to undertake routine bulk audit
analysis. Events related to the router network are similarly
forwarded to the network management server, for storage for
audit or operational planning purposes.

Corrections to a transaction within the current customer
session will normally involve a simple modification applied
directly to the transaction. But, if the transaction is of a
type (e.g. on-line financial) that has already been committed
then it will corrected by:

a) the reversal of the original incorrect transaction.

b) the addition of the correct transaction.

If a correction needs to be applied to a transaction in a

used:

a) identify the customer session.

b) identify and reverse the incorrect transaction

c) insert the correct transaction.

Corrections to transactions will not be possible after the cut-

client, processing centre or accounting report.

A refund is assumed to be distinct from a reversal to correct
errors. It is considered to be a transaction in which a
customer returns an item bought and is given back cash or is
credited the amount. A refund must be supported by proof of
purchase, such as a receipt, which provides a reference to the
original customer session and the transaction.

3. EPOSS will uniquely identify each transaction and each

If failure occurs after the session has ended but before all
transactions have been committed a cleanup procedure will use
the (uncleared) session log to complete the commit process.

A transaction that requires it will be settled and committed
when it is completed (i.e. before the end of the session).
Obviously, this type of transaction does not need to be
transferred and committed to the journal at the end of the
session. For the purposes of recovery this type of transaction
is treated as a session in its own right. It is marked
“committed” after it has been successfully committed but is not
cleared until the end of the session.

If failure occurs before the end of the session, none of the
transactions will have been committed except for those that had

order to find and select the transaction for reversal. A loss
or gain transaction may need to be generated to account for any
cash (or other MoP) involved in the transaction. Any client
summary will need to be re-printed to reflect the reversal.

Scenario 2. The transaction is in a previous stock unit
balance period. The transaction has not yet been despatched
(i.e. client cut-off) from the office.

The reversal must be carried out by the office manager within
the office administration function - accounting adjustments.
The manager will select the stock unit balance period and
browse the transaction journal in order to find and select the
transaction for reversal. A loss or gain transaction may need
to be generated to account for any cash (or other MoP) involved
in the transaction. The stock unit balance report and any
client summary will need to be re-printed to reflect the
reversal.

Scenario 3. The transaction is in the previous cash account
period (i.e. the stock unit has been rolled over). The
transaction has not yet been despatched (i.e. client cut-off)
from the office.

As above, the reversal must be carried out by the office
manager within the office administration function - accounting
adjustments. The manager will select the stock unit balance
period and browse the transaction journal in order to find and
select the transaction for reversal. A loss or gain transaction
may need to be generated to account for any cash (or other MoP)
involved in the transaction, The stock unit balance report and
any client summary will need to be re-printed to reflect the
reversal.

Scenario 4. The transaction has already been despatched
(i.e. cliene cut-off) from the office.

The transaction is not reversible. The error will probably
result in the receipt of an error notice from the client.

Note
There is a distinction between a reversal for accounting
corrections, such as the loss of a foil or stub, and a

reversal due to a transaction refund (e.g. when a customer
changes his mind).

1. EPOSS will provide a cash on hand declaration function
analogous to the filling of a paper form.

2. This function will allow the cash on hand to be declared
by denomination (including coin) for the purposes of daily cash
reporting and as part of the stock unit balancing process.

3. The cash on hand declaration can be invoked at any time
but will normally be carried at the end of a stock unit balance
period and always as part of the end of day process.

4, The EPOSS system only accepts two-sided transactions so
that it is always in a balanced state as far as the information
it precesses is concerned. In reality, the system will

sometimes be out of balance due to physical misplacement of
cash, value stock or any other transaction related vouchers.

It can also be logically balanced but physically in error as a

result of mis-keying (e.g. MoP as cash instead of a cheque).

In this case there may be a discrepancy between the system view ~
of total cash and the actual cash on hand, but it will not
necessarily result in a loss or gain being generated.

EPOSS will generate a loss or gain when:

Total Receipts (including Opening Stock and Cash)
does NOT equal

Total Payments (including Stock and Cash on Hand)

3. EPOSS will maintain the cash account period numbers and
their associated start and end dates as part of the reference

those occasions when the Outlet is authorised to combine two or
three weeks into a single accounting period EPOSS will produce
a single cash account report covering all transactions in the
combined period. It is proposed that the cash account week
number of the final week is associated with this cash account
report.

It is understood that some client reports require the actual
cash account week number to be identified. EPOSS will print
the actual cash account week number for these reports.

The following information is provided in order to assess the
complexity of administering local schemes centrally.

Currently there are seven regions each administering
approximately 20-30 schemes as indicated in the following

Scotland and Northern Ireland 13 14
South East 22 22
South Wales and South West 27 27
North Thames and East Anglia 22 23
Total 151 157

In general, all post offices within an area will offer the
local schemes. A few offices within the area may be excluded
from the scheme, and a few offices from neighbouring areas will
be included in the scheme.

The FAD code of an office is a seven digit number of the form
000 AAA C

where 000 = Numeric Office code
ADA = Numeric Area Code
C «= Check digit

An analysis of the FAD codes has provided the following
information:

1. There are a total of 145 areas in ail regions.

2. The largest number of offices in an area is 404.

3. The average number of offices in an area is 135.

c) the allowable methods of payment for settlement

7. In general, an outstanding customer session balance can be
settled by a single MoP or a combination of MoPs (e.g. part
cash and part cheque). In some circumstances a transaction
{e.g. savings account deposit) can require settlement in its
own right irrespective of other transactions in the customer

be introduced dynamically via reference data and applets.

9, EPOSS will support multiple simultaneous customer sessions
at the same counter position. It will allow a customer session
to be suspended and resumed as required. When one or more

customer sessions are suspended the clerk can continue to start
and end further sessions for other customers.

10. EPOSS will provide a Void (or cancel) facility for the
current customer session. Some transactions in the session may
not be “voidable” due to accounting or business rules.

11. EPOSS will allow reversals and refunds. These operations
will only be possible if POCcL and Client accounting and

mandatory and optional products. For example, the £1.00 postal
order product will have an associated 25p postal order fee
product, or the association of a product representing the
notional value of an MVL disc for accounting purposes. EPOSS
will support the linking of as many associated products to a
primary product as is appropriate.

EPOSS will support cross-selling in the form of messages and
prompts associated with selected products. For example, the
selling of theatre tickets could prompt the question: “And how
are you travelling there, sir/madam?” which could result in the
sale of a bus or rail ticket.

The automation of transaction processing at the counter will
allow the following business processes:

1) The data captured at the Outlet will be complete and
accurate within the context of the activity being recorded.
For example, transaction data will include information which
uniquely identifies each transaction.

2) The transfer of data will be handled by the TMS/Journaling
middleware. It will ensure that the data transfer is secure,
complete, accurate and robust.

3) EPOSS will provide validation of transaction data for both
format and content. Validation of the format of data will
normally be handled at the data entry level by the EPpOSss
Desktop using information from the product definition reference
data. EPOSS will also support the validation of the content of
the data in on-line and off-line operation.

4) EPOSS will record transactions and events in a way that is
resistant to tampering. In the event of fraud, this
information will be used to establish that the POCL Service was
operating as intended.

5) EPOSS will support transactions which force the printing of
a customer receipt. A copy of the receipt will be printed for
retention in the Outlet. All of the transaction details will
be recorded in the journal and these can also be used for the
resolution of problems.

6) The Outlet, stock unit, and user will be all be identified
when recording transactions and any activities involving cash

and value stock. This will enable accountability to be
maintained for the handling of cash, value stock and
transaction documentation.

7) EPOSS will record a complete set of transactions for a
customer session at the point of sale. This will include all
methods of payment.

8) EPOSS will implement a tiered level of access control. Each
function will have an associated access level and the user will
require a corresponding (or better) privilege level to access
the facility. Combined with the user logon requirement, this
will provide a controlled environment for all users of the
system. EPOSS will also provide the facility for an authorised
user to maintain information about the users. This facility
will allow the introduction of new users, the modification of
user attributes (including password and privilege level), the
deletion of users, and the suspension of a user’s access to the
system. There will be a similar facility for stock units

8) The TMS/Journaling middleware will provide transparent data
replication within the Outlet and transmission to TMS. This
will provide a robust environment for Outlets with two or more
counter positions. For Outlets with a single counter position
EPOSS will augment the transmission to TMS with transparent
replication of data to an auxiliary storage device (e.g.
diskette drive). Recovery will also be free of operator
intervention, EPOSS will rebuild the system using the data
from TMS and will augment this with information from the
auxiliary storage device. The process described above removes
the need for staff to perform back ups.

10) Each user, counter position and counter equipment device
will be uniquely defined within the Outlet.

11) EPOSS will allow each stock unit to be balanced as often as
is required within a cash account week. Balancing will involve
the reconciliation of transaction data, cash and stock
movements against the actual cash and stock held. The
balancing process will provide the opportunity for review and
amendment before final review and authorisation.

12) Transaction data will be transmitted to TMS in a timely and
efficient manner using a secure method.

13) Transaction data that has not been transmitted to TMS will
be clearly identifiable.

14) A recorded transaction will be reconcilable against any
supporting vouchers (i.e. stubs, forms, counterfoils) generated
er collected during the transaction. Where necessary the
vouchers will be made available for central processing and
validation. :

a view of the last known office balance position on demand.

16) All movements of cash, stock and other items will be
recorded and clearly identified. See responses to requirements
691, 807 and 822.

17) EPOSS will produce all specified summaries when required.
If required, summaries will contain only those transactions not
already summarised. The process will take into account the
client cut-off's such that transactions already reported and
despatched prior to the cut-off are not included on subsequent
summaries.

18) EPOSS will support and identify items posted to suspense
accounts.

19) Pathway will ensure that the system complies with all the
appropriate legislation.

26) The Outlet will continue to operate using the fallback
procedures following a system failure. This will include the
manual recording of all events and transactions, and this can
be considered to be an “audit trail”. On recovery, the system
will record the fact that the system failure took place, and
any events (such as transaction entry) which are part of the
recovery process will be identified as such.

The Pathway solution and supporting services provide
comprehensive contingency arrangements for all outlets. These
include :-

A distributed design which insulates the majority of counter
transactions from any failures external to the Outlet.

Comprehensive help desk support to provide OBCS transaction
authorisation where an Outlet is out of action.

Highly resilient designs for TMS, including multiple servers
and resilient local and wide area networks.

Transition of a post office will be undertaken on a “whole
office” basis and will be capable of being performed at any
point during the weekly cash account cycle. The sooner after
the weekly cash account is struck the less the retrospective
re-application of transactions will be required, whether this
re-application is manual or automated.

Because of this approach, contingency during transition of a
post office dees not represent a discrete requirement.

Facilities will be provided to enable information from offices
with ECCO+, Capture, PO Balancer (and similar programs) to be
extracted, converted and used as part of the automation
initialisation process. The automated migration of such data
will be implemented if sufficient information is available
about its storage and the number of offices affected is large
enough to warrant the creation of the appropriate migration
software.

The extraction of data from the office’s existing systems will
be carried out in a non-intrusive manner such that the
integrity of the systems being replaced will not be is not
compromised and will be available for live use until the
manager is satisfied that the new system has been adequately
established. In particular systems will permit more than one
migration sequence to be attempted such that a failed attempt
does not compromise the live system.

It is envisaged that all cash account products will be
“transactable” (in at least a minimum form) as soon as the

office EPOSS automation is operational.

customer session, will be immediately replicated to any other
counter position PCs in the outlet and periodically to central
servers in TMS. Each transaction will have a unique and
increasing sequence number and TMS facilities ensure that
transactions cannot be replicated out of sequence.

The end of day process in each Outlet will transmit any
remaining transactions, any end of day control totals and an
end of day marker.

TMS Agents will extract information from the central TMS
journal and prepare the files (including transaction and value
totals) for subsequent dispatch to POCL and their Clients. Any
outlets for which an end of day marker has not been received
will be identified and investigated.

2. POCL and Client synchronisation

It is anticipated that the AP datafiles will be accumulated
during the day by the TMS Agent and that the files for POCL
(i.e. for TIP or equivalent) will be generated following Outlet
closures.

Transactions for POCL Clients (e.g. AP Clients) and for POCL
are all derived from the same source data (in TMS) and will
therefore be consistent. File dispatch to POCL and PoOcL
Clients will be determined by the operational windows agreed
with these parties but will always occur at least once every 24
hour period.

The agents which extract and transmit TMS data to Clients and
TIP act independently and can access the same source data
simultaneously. This ensures that the data received by TIP is
entirely consistent with the data transmitted to the clients.

In addition to the Outlets’ Transaction records, Client cut-off
records will be transmitted to TMS from Outlets (by Stock Unit
and by Balancing Period). The Client cut-off records will
indicate the despatch of foils, stubs and vouchers to the
appropriate processing centre. These Client cut-off records can
be used to control the extraction and transmission of TMS data
by the agents.

1.1 Pathway will ensure that all captured data (that is inward
data across service interfaces) is complete, and accurately
reflected in the appropriate outward interfaces. These
specifically to include:

transaction data of all transaction types and modes including
stock and money levels

reference data changes, both local (from an individual
outlet} and from POCL Reference Data System except for any
transient arrangements

such data consistency will be maintained at the levels of
interface and across interfaces according to requirement, e.g.
data captured in EPOSS is accurately reflected in the interface
between OPS and TMS

1.2 Pathway will provide for the synchronisation of data flows
and storage, by applying timing data (date and time stamps) and
time sentinels (end of day records) as appropriate. This
specifically to include:

monitoring data transfers and accounting for data brought
forward, received, passed on and carried forward across the
service boundaries

monitoring data transfers and accounting for data across
interfaces internal to Pathway

for example, EPOSS transaction data transferred to TMS and
subsequently transferred to TIP

where a single data stream is “switched” to more than one
recipient, Pathway will reconcile or eliminate any differences
due to timing between transfers, providing information to each
recipient such that they can reconcile with other recipients of
the same data even though such recipients may process the data
at different times and frequencies

for example, POCL will require (at least) daily volume and
value totals of APS transactions sent to its clients, such that
POCL may reconcile these against the daily volume and value
totals sent to TIP.

1.3 Pathway will ensure that data is consistent between the
levels where transaction or stock and money level data is held,
maintained or transferred at more than one level. This
specifically to include:

transaction data at summary and individual item level

Pathway will resolve any reconciliation exceptions produced
by its reconciliation processes

Pathway will provide reconciliation reports at summary level
and identification of reconciliation exceptions to POCL by 9 am
of the day following that in which the reconciliation exception
occurred

Pathway will use all reasonable endeavours to resolve
reconciliation exceptions promptly

2. Post Office Outlet Reconciliation Requirements

2.1 Pathway will ensure that stock and money levels are
reconciled with transaction data. This will be:

at the transaction level

at the customer session level
at the stock unit level

at the outlet level

Note: the requirements for balancing within an office are
defined in the EPOSS requirements, those for stock and money
movements between offices will be reconciled by the PpochL
Inventory Management System using data provided to it from
EPOSS via TMS.

2.2 Pathway will provide the fundamental controls for stock
and money brought and carried forward, transaction data and
transfers to/from suspense as detailed in the EPOSS
requirements as well as facilities to allow permitted reversals
and rectifications. Such controls will be available in
fallback or recovery after failures.

2.3 The reconciliation of stock and money for transactions
will be, in effect, instantaneous, with a record of the levels
of stock and money within a stock unit being maintained as the
transaction is committed.

1. Pathway’s Management Information System (MIS) will capture
the data necessary to facilitate effective contract and service
management. It will employ exception reporting for business
performance and monitoring reviews.

1.1 Contractual information presented via the business review
route will embrace:

a) Service Level Performance (by event, priority,
classification and type)

b) Service Delivery Analysis (by product, function,
outlet and role)

c) Contractual Alerts and Escalations (by Red, Orange and
Amber classification)

d) Systems Operation (by type, performance and
availability).

1.2 Information relating to business reviews will be analysed
via exception reporting during the life of the event. Where
this relates to alerts and escalations it will be supplemented
by a declared owning problem/project manager. Critical
dependent systems will be subject to full SLA monitoring and
reporting via the review forum.

2. Requests by POCL for information during the life of the
contract, and relating to service management of the contract,
will be handled and processed in an effective and efficient
manner. Formal requests for information will be via the
business review route and delivered against pre-declared agenda
requirements. Please note that Pathway does not commit to
providing an MIS service after the life of the contract unless
provision for this is explicitly made within the Contract.

2.1 Special and ad-hoc information needs would have to be
fully understood and sized before contractual commitment can be
made. The scope, volume, timing and frequency of such requests
would be part of the task activity before such commitment.
Currently this is neither defined or qualified.

3. Pathway will provide information that would facilitate
infrastructure activities by POCL in matters embracing
resource, network and productivity. Where these topics are an
integral part of service delivery events they will
automatically be included in the business review forum.
Additional or supplementary requests would fall under the
criteria of paragraph 2.1 above.

3.1 Data will be available that enables service analysis
against the key attributes of POCL outlets. Flexibility will
be maintained by making data organisationally independent. Thus
any organisational based information will be defined and
qualified by construct at the time of information search
enquiries.

4, Pathway will, via the review forum, provide service
delivery information that would facilitate extrapolation for
marketing planning activity. Full trend and plan projections
against forecasts and budget could result. Pathway EIS would be

1. Lecal Stop List proposal

Pathway propose that a local stop list strategy be adopted in
order that the risks and costs associated with maintaining and
accessing the entire stop list at every outlet are removed.
Each post office will have a local stop list. Foreign Order
Book encashments will be checked against remote stop lists
accessible via TMS.

For a full description of the manner in which Stop Lists will
be maintained see Service Architecture Design Document, Section
4.1.4.2.2.

2. Pathway understand that the maximum size of the stop list
will be 1.5 million entries.

3. Pathway understand that the maximum size of a stop list
update will normally be 100,000 entries. The Pathway solution
for the OBCS stop list is not as sensitive to the size of the
stop list as other solutions, such as that used by ESNS.
Pathway would require notification if POCL expected the stop
list update size to exceed 100,000 entries.

4, Pathway understand that a null content file may be sent
comprising solely of header and footer records.

1 Pathway will arrange for the electrical safety testing of
all of its equipment installed on POCL’s sites enabling POCL
and Postmasters to meet their legal obligations under the
Electricity at Work Regulations 1989.

2 The Regulations

2.1 The Electricity at Work Regulations 1989 are a statutory
instrument arising from the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974.
The purpose of the regulations is ‘to require precautions to be
taken against the risk of death or personal injury from
electricity in work activities’.

2.2 The regulations impose duties on employers in respect of
‘systems, electrical equipment and conductors and in respect of
work activities on or near electrical equipment’.

2.3 To meet the requirements of the regulations, which came
into force on ist April 1990, it is necessary to assess all
electrical equipment, including information technology
equipment, with a view to eliminating possible hazards. In
practice this will usually necessitate a program of recorded
inspections and where appropriate, tests.

2.4 Full and accurate records must be kept, if for no other
reason than the ‘duty holder’ can demonstrate that ‘all
reasonable steps were taken and all due diligence exercised to
avoid the commission of an offence under the Act’.

2.5 The onus for compliance is with the employer, who is
responsible for the correct use of the equipment and the safety
of employees. The regulations define the employer or his
nominated employee(s) as the duty holder.

3 Scope of the service

3.1 The Electricity At Work Inspection And Test Service
enables Pathway’s customers to meet their legal obligations
under the Electricity at Work Regulations 1989.

3.2 The service provides for inspection, test and labelling of
each item of electrical equipment. Full records will be
presented to the customer on completion of the service.

3.3 During the service, the Pathway service deliverer will
carry out the following activities:

Visual inspection of all Pathway installed equipment and
mains cords on the customer site

inspection and test and brings this to the attention of the
customer and arranges for its replacement

Records test results against a unique identifier for each
item

3.4 Once these activities are complete the service deliverer
provides the Postmaster with the test results. Test results
will also be made available to POCL and will be maintained in
Pathway'’s database.

3.5 The service is delivered during normal office hours,
however, Pathway may agree to provide the service outside those
hours on request. The schedule for safety test visits will be
agreed in advance with Postmasters and POCL'’s Service Managers.

3.6 All remedial maintenance work carried out on site will
comply with the standards prescribed and will ensure that the
requirements of the Act continue to be met upon return to
service.

3.7 Pathway will report on the progress of its safety test
schedule at each monthly service review meeting.

2 Helpdesk Service
2.1 General

2.2.21 The Horizon System Helpdesk will provide a single
point of contact providing assistance and fault management to
Help Desk Customers. Help Desk Customers will include Users and
those of POCL’s Clients with access to the POCL Services
supported.

2.1.2 The Horizon System Helpdesk service will embrace
fault management, advice and guidance and overall operational
service management, information and administration. It will

CODIFIED AGREEMENT SCHEDULE A16 RESTRICTED CONTRACTS

operate a full call logging service 24 hours per day, 365 days
per year (except Christmas Day).

2.1.3 Contact with the Horizon System Helpdesk will be by
‘local-call’ telephone (e.g. an 0345 mumber). The average
response time will be targeted at 80% of all calls answered
within 20 seconds and 99.9% targeted to be answered within 40
seconds. A target of less than 5% of calls during peak hours
will be abandoned calls. The percentage of ‘calls not answered’
shall be less than 1%. This includes calls where the line is
busy as well as calls answered but put on the ‘waiting queue’.

2.1.4 Three levels of service will be provided extending
from Level 1 addressing simple calls through more complex level
2 calls to level 3 calls which involve support from outside of
the help desk environment.

2.1.5 Operational Service availability, details of
scheduled interruptions and progress towards full service
resumption will be communicated by the Horizon System Helpdesk
to its customers. The Horizon System Helpdesk management team
will assist POCL in negotiating scheduled interruptions to
service with the Help Desk Customers.

2.2 Level 1 Service

2.2.1 Level 1 calls may be categorised as those which are
relatively simple and straightforward to explain and diagnose
and which can be fully resolved in less than 10 minutes by the
call taker who will have sole responsibility for the call’s
progress to resolution.

2.2.2 As end-users become more familiar and experienced
with Pathway’s systems, the time required to explain simple
resolutions will decrease and may approach an average of 5
minutes. Calls taking longer than 10 minutes to resolve will be
categorised either as Level 2 or will signify a potential
skills problem within the Horizon System Helpdesk or the post
office. Calls identifying potential skills problems will be
evaluated by Pathway and raised for discussion at the monthly
service review meetings.

2.3 Level 2 Service

2.3.1 Level 2 calls will generally be more complex problems
and potential faults. The Horizon System Helpdesk will make
extensive use of ‘Expert Systems’ diagnostic tools to assist in
their resolution and these may require more detailed and
extensive analysis, taking more time.

FUJ00000071

FUJ00000071

CODIFIED AGREEMENT SCHEDULE Al16é RESTRICTED CONTRACTS

2.3.2 Calls are transferred to Level 2 electronically
within the same help desk Call Management System. All of the
details of the call are preserved and available at Level 2.
Calls at all levels are presented to the diagnosticians in the
form of a prioritised stack of outstanding work-in-progress.

2.3.3 Typically, Level 2 problems will take less than 30
minutes to resolve but in extreme cases may take longer, up to
45 mins. Much of the diagnosis will be carried out ‘off-line’
from the originator, and may involve one or more interim
telephone calls from the Horizon System Helpdesk to clarify
symptoms or elicit extra information.

2.3.4 Level 2 calls will be analysed to identify trends and
patterns which may indicate the need for improvements in the
diagnostic process. New problems identified will always be
analysed to determine whether an appropriate Level 1 solution
is possible to save time in future instances.

2.3.5 As for Level 1, Level 2 calls which take longer than
45minutes to resolve will be categorised either as Level 3 or
will signify a potential skills problem within the Horizon
System Helpdesk or the post office. Calls identifying potential
skills problems will be evaluated by Pathway and raised for
discussion at the monthly service review meetings.

2.4 Level 3 Service

2.4.1 Level 3 service is invoked when the call can not be
fully resolved wholly within the Horizon System Helpdesk but
requires escalation either to a higher level of technical
support or to an engineer to perform a maintenance visit.

2.4.2 Calls will be transferred to Level 3 support
electronically complete with all of the details of progress
made at levels 1 and 2. Calls will be prioritised and
categorised so that they can be actioned within standard agreed
timescales.

2.4.3 All level 3 calls will be monitored to ensure that
the Service Level Agreement is met. The call will also continue
to be monitored post resolution to ensure that repeat or
intermittent failures are identified as quickly as possible.

2.4.4 Level 3 calls will be analysed to identify patterns
and trends of failure either within specific Outlets or with
system items.

be provided between 05:00 and 08:00 and between 20:00 and
24:00, Monday to Saturday, and between 07:00 and 22:00 on
Sundays.

2.5.3 Calls may be received directly from users or from
POCL help desks and help lines. Calls received which are
outside of the responsibility of the Horizon System Helpdesk
will be transferred to the appropriate authority.

2.5.4 The hours of service may be changed on request given
2 working days notice. Emergency cover may be provided at 5
hours notice.

2.6 Problem Management

2.6.1 Pathway will employ a specially developed Problem
Management System to log and manage all calls to the Horizon
System Helpdesk. The system is an enhanced version of one of
ICL’s current call management systems.

2.6.2 The system data model is comprehensive and records
all of the necessary data associated with calls during their
life. Call data is recorded as a collection of ‘progress
details’ each date and time stamped and ‘signed’ by the call
taker providing a complete audit trail.

The OPS will support a reliable, secure and encrypted means for
the transfer of data that may subsequently be used for
cryptographic applications at the counter.

The cryptographic services within the Pathway solution can be
considered in three groups:

* services covering post office traffic from and to POCL and
POCL Clients on the one hand and the Pathway Central Services
Layer on the other

CODIFIED AGREEMENT SCHEDULE Al6 RESTRICTED CONTRACTS

* services covering the authentication of the Point to Point
connection between the TMS layer and the post office

* services covering transaction traffic to and from the
Central Services Layer and the OPS and at the OPS itself

This requirement response describes the means by which keys
are distributed for the last group. The methods described are
subject to detailed agreement with HMG (CESG).

The OPS related cryptographic services comprise:

The selective digital signature and authentication of files
or transactions to or from the correspondence layer. The
purpose here is data integrity - to prevent tampering or non-
malign loss or injection of data.

Data will be transmitted in clear. Data will be digested
using a CESG-approved hashing algorithm called SHA and this
digest used to produce a digital signature using a companion
algorithm called DSA which uses asymmetric key pair techniques.
It is expected that a key length of 768 bits will be used. The
keys used will be session key pairs renewed periodically,
probably half-yearly. The session keys will be transported
using the CESG-approved modified Diffie-Hellman algorithm and
relying on master key encryption. Methods of master key
encryption will be agreed with POCL and CESG. The options
include secure factory installation into the OPS equipment by
Pathway of the initial key protected by Microsoft Windows NT’s
accredited access control. Alternatively first installation
will be via security accredited personnel, using manual keys
transported securely or by IC memory card, and input using
specific role protection. Renewal of master keys may use
similar manual or IC memory card-based methods.

The encryption and decryption of data stored on disk. The
purpose here is privacy - to prevent disclosure of sensitive
data.

Similarly, the keys used will be single session keys, managed
using the same key distribution methods as described above.

Data will be enciphered and deciphered using a CESG-approved
symmetric algorithm called RED PIKE.

Note that such data will only be enciphered for OPS journal
write and deciphered for OPS journal read. Replication of a
journal entry to and from TMS will be in clear.

The volume of transactions will increase significantly with the

increase in the number of “events” and checkpoints which can
result in recorded transactions.

Transactions which cannot be substantiated (e.g. cancellation
before commit) are open to abuse if they contribute to payment

or penalty.

Pathway Response

Pathway acknowledges that, during the lifetime of the contract
or at termination, POCL Services supplied by Pathway may need
to be replaced or supplemented with services provided by other

suppliers. Pathway further acknowledges that it must be
technically viable for its POCL Services to be replaced by
and/or interface to services from other suppliers. The

commercial viability of such replacements or adjuncts is
largely a matter for the other supplier and Pathway can offer
no warranty on this.

Pathway has agreed in its response to requirement 951 to

provide the service architecture document which will contain,

inter alia, the functionality of the major components, the
interfaces between them, and their design service levels.

These interface descriptions shall cover:

a) a definition of the business processes supported across the
service boundary, including who originates the processes;

b) all business transactions supported across the service
boundary including responses, associated information, any
supporting facilities and any constraints including
required timings.

Attention is drawn also to requirement 869 (TMS)and the Pathway

response. Pathway will specify the internal performance
requirements of any sub-system that is retendered. Pathway
reserves the right to modify service targets for overall

performance at the contract service boundaries in the event
that such a subsystem is retendered and/or let to a third
party.

Pathway’s costing and charging basis for integration with other
suppliers’ services will be on strict commercial terms.

Where a service or an upgrade thereof is supplied by another
supplier Pathway will require that it conforms to specification
as evidenced by a satisfactory test report based on a test
specification agreed by Pathway before being put into
operational use. In the event of malfunction of Pathway’s POCL
Services caused by the malfunction of another supplier‘’s
service, that service supplier shall be liable for all losses
sustained by Pathway including lost revenues and additional
operational costs.

2.3. Values of C and T relating to these Services are

distinguished in the formulae below by appending the
Service name in parentheses.

2.4. Transaction numbers (T) and the cumulative variance
(C} are considered in two groupings: the first group
is OBCS; the second group is EPOSS and APS:

2.5. Firstly, the totals of the C and T values for OBCS
are calculated.

T, = T(OBCS)
C, = C(OBCS).

2.6. Secondly, the totals of the C and T values for APS
and EPOSS are calculated.

Tz, = T(APS) + T(EPOSS)

Cz = C{APS) + C(EPOSS)

The following calculations are then carried out for
each of C,; with T, and Cz; with T:.

2.8. The Minimum Acceptable Threshold is expressed as C, =
zero (09) seconds and no liquidated damages are
payable in respect of the Services to which Cy
relates when C, <= 0.

2.9. The Termination Review Threshold is:
C, > (Th * 0.5).

2.10 The liquidated damages for excess time are
calculated, based on the aggregated ail Outlet

figures of C, and T, (for the values n = 1 and n = 2),
as follows:

where (C, > 0) and (C, <= (T, * @.2)), then the
liquidated damages are:

Cy * O. 7p;

where (C, > (Ty, * 0.2)) and (C, <= (T, * 0.3)), then
the liquidated damages are:

(T, * O.24p) + ({Cy - (Ty * 0.2}) * 1.0p);

where (Cy, > (T, * 0.3)} and (C, <= (T, * 9.4}), then
the liquidated damages are:

(T, * 0.24p) + ({C, - (T, * 0.3)) * 1.4p);

calculating the remedies:

. T (APS): e total number of APS Transactions in the
reporting period;

mulated difference between the

actual measured variable system componen
agreed benchmarked variable system compone in the
ecD entitled “APS Benchmark Counter Transaction
Times” against the APS Transaction Types shown in the
table in paragraph 1. 4 plus the total accumulated
difference between the agreed benchmarked total

transaction times and the maximum total transaction
times.

lating the value for  C(APS) above, APS

2. TRANSACTION TIME
2.1. The maximum Contracted Transaction Time (including both
manual and  EPOSS components) of an POSS only

Transaction (i.e. excluding those Transactions which
make use of EPOSS facilities but have their own timing
requirements inclusive of the EPOSS component) shall be
not more than the weighted average of:

e one and nine-tenths of a second (1.9 sec.) more than
the equivalent manual Transaction time for those
Outlets which operated manually at 15 May 1996 and

e nine-tenths of a second (0.9 sec.) more than the
equiv t ECCO Transaction time for those Outlets
which were automated and used the ECCO software at 15
May 1996.

2.2. At 15 May 1996, the weightings shall be by reference to
PIVOT transaction volumes, as documented in the CCD
entitled “PIVOT Transaction Volumes, by Outlet type and
by type of EPOSS Transaction”. In the event that the

ion volumes are no longer available from PIVOT,
the weig ngs shall be by reference to equivalent data
produced by the management information systems used by
the Contractor at that time. While PIVOT transaction
volumes are available, reports on PIVOT transaction
volumes shall be prepared by POCL annually. Thereafter
reports on data produced by the Contractor’s management
information systems shall be prepared by the Contractor
annually. The report for the 52 (fifty two) or 53 (fifty
three) weeks ending on or within 14 (fourteen) days of
the previous end of year Invoice date shall be used to
determine the relevant weighting

2.3. The method for determining equivalent Contracted
Transaction Times will be as set out in the CCD en led
“Counter Transaction Per formance Measurement and
Benchmarking”

2.4. Within EPOSS there shall be a number of different

Transaction types (e.g. relating to different POCL
Products), for which the Cont ted Transaction Time may
differ. The table below sha be used to record the

synthesised time. For EPOSS, in fallback a synthesised
time, which shall not be les than the Contracted
Transaction Time, shall be agreed between POCL and the
Contractor, which shall be validated during the
Operational Trial. Each time a Transaction is undertaken
in fallback, the difference between the synthesised time

Time (if the Transaction had not been undertaken in
faliback) shall be added to C(EPOSS).

. The Contractor shall be able to determine the number of

normal transactions (ie not performed in fallback) for
any time span, for each Outiet, over the prior month. At
month end, for each reported incidence of fallback
operation, the system shall estimate the number of EPOSS
Transactions performed in fallback during the specific
period by accumulating the total number of EPOSS
ransactions performed in that Outlet in equivalent time
spans of the same day of the week during the preceding
four weeks and dividing by four. If no matching period
for any of the four weeks can be identified then the
number of transactions in that particular pericd of the
week may be assumed to be zero.

The following table identifies the synthesised times for
the fallback scenarios. These times shall be validated
as part of Operational Trial, and adjusted by agreement
between the parties. The difference between the
synthesised times and the appropriate Contracted

Transaction Time shall be added to C(EPOSS). The
Contractor shall report to POCL occurrences of each
scenario. The synthesised times for the fallback

4. GENERAL POCL INFRASTRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS

4.1. INTRODUCTION

4.1.1. This section contains characteristics common to more
than one element of the POCL Infrastructure Services.
{extrapolation]

4.2. LINKS FROM OPS TO TMS

4.2.1. General

4.2.1.1, Each instance of OPS within Outlets shall interface
with TMS to allow the transfer, in both directions, of
authorised data files and messages. [R467]

4.2.1.2. The transfer of data between OPS and TMS shall be
secure, complete, accurate and robust. [R467]

4.2.1.3. Within OPS it shall be possible for OFS to identify
whether data from OPS have been received by TMS or not.
[R467]

4.2.2, Data Replication

4.2.2.1. The Contractor shall use data replication and
synchronisation techniques to ensure that data transfer
between Counter Positions at which OPS is provided and
between instances of OPS at each Counter Position and
the TMS are secure, complete, accurate and robust.
[S467]

4.2.2.2. Once a Transaction has been settled at a Counter
Position, TMS shall commit the full Transaction detaiis

to that Counter Position PC’s message store. The
Transaction details shall simultaneously be
automatically replicated to all other PCs in the Outlet
so that the data are securely captured. In addition,

the Contractor shall automatically replicate Transaction
details to a remote server at which TMS is provided.
{S467}

4.2.2.3. The OPS PCs and TMS servers are known as “nodes”.
[S467]

4. All data and message transfers from a single node
shall be generated in a strict numbered sequence with a
unique node identification. Any attempt to intreduce a
fraudulent message shall be automatically detected and
rejected by OPS. [S467]

. An additional pseudo random sequence number produced
from a cryptographic algorithm can also be included to

assurance of content and source are required;

e Data encryption used selectively on certain data
fields. [4.1.4.2.3.4.2 / S467]

4.2.3.2. All messages and data shall have a cyclic redundancy
check applied when they « initially committed to the
journal and this shall be time the message
or data is accessed. This shall protect against
accidental corruption and casual tampering. Any failure
of a cyclic redundancy check shall cause the message to
be rejected and retrieved from alternate nodes. [5467]

4.2.3.3. In the event that nodes fail, recovery shall take
place in accordance with the CCD ent ed “Post
Site Failure Contingency Procedures” and sections

4.1.5.2 and 4.1.6 of the SADD.

4.2.3.4. Where POCL requires the origin of data to be
authenticated, the Contractor shall apply a digital
signature to the data prior to transmission and shall
then check it upon receipt. Digital signature
techniques and the data to which they are applied shall
be described in the “Security Functional Specification”
referenced in Schedule BO3. [S467]

4.2.3.8. ntractor shall automatically detect any attempt
to alter data and shall log such attempts for subsequent
investigation by the Contractor, Details of all such

attempts shall be passed to POCL. (S46€7]

support, technical support, documentation, and
consumables} by the commencement of Roll-Out and shall
provide such access thereafter when requested to do so
by POCL. (R525)

IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY FOR RECONCILIATION DATA

Clients served using the APS shall receive only one
stream of unrecon ed data irrespective of the source
of the polling at Outlets (whether via ne POCL Data
Polling Centre at Farnborough or Contractor facilities).
The Contractor and FOCL shall agree (such agreement not
to be un sonably withheld or delayed) a strategy to
achieve this requirement as from the commencement of
Roll-Out. (R971)

The strategy shall include, but not exclusively, a
timetable separate from and shorter than the 1
Programme, for the Contractor to absorb the
workload from the POCL Data Polling Centre. (R971)

AP CLIENT LIABILITY DURING THE OPERATIONAL TRIAL

Until the completion of the Operational Trial, the
Contractor shall indemnify POCL in the event of POCL
incurring liabil es to their AP Clients as a result of
service level failures in the POCL Services. Once the
Operational Trial has successfully completed, the
abilities defined elsewhere in this Codified Agreement
shall prevail over this paragraph. The parties shall
agree a limit to such an indemnity, such agreement net
to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

SCHEDULE G10 ~- POCL INFRASTRUCTURE SERVICE LEVELS AND REMEDIES

7.

PURPOSE

This Scheduie details Service Levels and liquidated
damages applicable for the POCL Infrastructure
Services.

OVERVIEW OF THE SERVICE LEVEL MECHANISM

Schedule B10 sets out the aggregation of each POCL
Service’s Service Levels

This Schedule defines the levels of Service required
by POCL from the POCL Infrastructure Service, and
details the associated liquidated damages in the
event that the levels of Service fail to meet these
requirements.

This Schedule specifies Service Levels which are
associated with specific liquidated damages and other
Service Levels that do not have associated liquidated
damages.

The reporting of actual levels of Service as compared
with Service Levels, the calculation of liquidated
damages and the payment of liquidated damages, shall
be in accordance with Schedule A06.

All monetary values specified in this Schedule shall
be subject to annual indexation from the 15 May
1996. The basis for this indexation shall be the
Retail Price Index.

Each Service Level, which has associated quidated
damages, has two Service Level thresholds (“Service
Thresholds”):

® Minimum Acceptable Threshold;

* Termination Review Threshold.

For any Service Level where liquidated damages apply
in the event that the actual level of Service falls
below the Minimum Acceptable Threshold, such
liquidated damages shall apply to the extent that the
actual level of Service falls below the Minimum
Acceptable Threshold and above the Termination Review
Threshold. Where the actual level of Service falls
below the Termination Review Threshold, liquidated
damages shall apply to the extent that the actual
level of Service falls below the Minimum Acceptable
Threshold and above the Termination Review Threshold,
and damages at large rather than liquidated damages

shall apply to the extent that the actual level of
Service falls below the Termination Review Threshold.

Each Service Level which has no associated liquidated
damages has a single Service Threshold.

POCL is primarily concerned with the overall
performance of the Service as it impacts upon their
business, Target Service Levels between the Services
are therefore not set by POCh. However, the
Contractor shall set its own target Service Levels
and advise POCL of both internal target Service
Levels and any subsequent changes. The Contractor
shall monitor and report to POCL the actual measured
performance against their own target Service Levels.
The timing, content and format of this report shall
be agreed be en the Contractor and POCL prior to
Operational Trial Acceptance Date.

DAMAGES

Data file delivery

Data files shall be delivered to TIP by 03:00. [G01 -
para 3.4.1.5 (b)]

In each case the proportion of Transaction records
delivered to TIP in the first and subsequent data
file transmission (i.e. Transaction on day A,
delivery to TIP by 03:00 day B, day C, day D) shall
be measured by the Contractor.

Minimum Acceptable Threshold is that:

« 97% of all Transaction records to be d
day B;

vered by

% of all Transaction records to be delivered by
day C;

* 100% of all Transaction records to be delivered by
day D.

The Termination Review Threshold is that:

88% of all Transaction records to be delivered by day
BD.

Liquidated damages are calculated as follows:
Liquidated damages =

The liquidated damages payable by the Contractor
shall be based on a series of measurements over the
reporting period, accumulated over a range of
Services. This Schedule specifies the contribution
made by OBCS, while the formulae for calculating the
value of the liquidated damages and the effects of
the accumulation of effects over the range of
Services is described in Schedule B10.

§.1.2. The following variables shall be recorded and used in
calculating the remedies:

(a) T(OBCS): the total number of OBCS Transactions in
the Service Level Measurement Period;

(6) C(OBCS): the total accumulated difference
between the actual measured variable system
components and the agreed benchmarked variable
system components in the CCD entitled ‘“OBCS
Benchmark Counter Transaction Times” against the
OBCS Transaction Types shown in the table in
paragraph 3. 1 plus the total accumulated
difference between the agreed benchmarked total
transaction times and he maximum total
transaction times.

5.1.3. In calculating the value for C(OBCS) above, OBCS
encashment Transactions which take place in fallback
mode (and therefore cannot be accurately accounted
for in Service measurements) shall be considered to
have taken a synthesised time.

5.1.4. The following Fallback scenarics have been identified
by the Contractor:

{a} Bar code failure
The Service fails to read the bar code on the
order book. Assumes Counter Clerk shall swipe

the bar code three times and then test the bar
code reader with a test pattern. Should the bar
code reader be working, then the order book
shall be impounded. The Contractor shall
distinguish between Bar code failure and bar
code reader failure.

(b) Bar code reader failure
Assumes Counter Clerk knows bar code reader is
faulty and therefore does not swipe bar code

In the event that the actual level of Service falls

consecutive months then POCL may terminate the
Codified Agreement in accordance with Clause 902.2 of
the Codified Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt
this right of termination is in addition to the

4.4 and 4.5 of Schedule A06.

OBCS Stop List Data

The liquidated damages due to late provision of stop
list data at the Counter Positions providing x
intended to provide OBCS are calculated as follows:

Liquidated damages =

((((100 - actual level of service by Day D) / 100 *
total number of Transactions * 1.0 pence) +

{((99 - actual level of Service by Day C) / 100 *

(total number of Transactions - any also failing at
Day D} * 1.0 pence) +

((97 ~ actual level of Service by Day B} / 100 *
{total number of Transactions - any also failing at

Day D+ Day C) * 1.0 pence) +

The actual level of service is measured up to the
point in time the stop list data is loaded on to the
OBCS host and hence available to the Counter
Positions providing or intended to provide OBCS.

Data File Delivery

The liquidated damages due to late provision of Data
Files to the ESNCS are calculated as follows:

Liguidated damages =
