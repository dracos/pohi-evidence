3. Management Summary

During this Assessment a total of: 4 Observations and 3 Good Practice
Observations were raised.

In summary, the main findings, and recommendations where appropriate, were as
follows:

A mature management system is in place, exploiting both intranet and PVCS
Configuration Management tools for control and publication

There is significant evidence of improvement initiatives having been successfully
pursued, especially in the last 9 months

Measurement of processes and a formal approach to process management/review
are in place, at least from April 2002

Commitment to adoption of ‘corporate’ processes and Business Management
System is in evidence, although the manner of adoption will (and should) depend
on impact on the Pathway business

Evidence in support of the senior management view of a relatively high state of
employee motivation and commitment was observed in all areas visited

There is considerable challenge to Pathway to continue to operate profitably in the
context of a demanding customer facing considerable change and cost-reduction
in their own business

4. Assessment Commentary

4.1 Business Management System
Assessment Criteria : process mgt, document control, adequate resourcing, BMS
integrity, process measurement, improvement.

= Fujitsu Services Pathway has a project/unit Business Mgt System which is
comprehensive, effectively controlled and in the process of being updated to
reflect ICL to Fujitsu Services changes

F/119.2/2
Specific resource is assigned to maintain the BMS integrity and to develop the
content in line with business development (eg already considering impact of
proposals to be made for renewal of contract post-2005)

Exploits PVCS well for version control and approval of content

There is a recently launched process to manage and record process review,
including use of a review checklist which also serves as a record of decisions
Operational units (directorates) are involved through use of Directorate
Quality Representatives in the review activity

There is active alignment of processes with recent Fujitsu Services changes
(eg CSLC v9) as well as compliance with corporate Process Management
Methodology

All previous assessment corrective actions were reviewed and verified as
closed

Process measurement has been significantly improved — see subsequent
sections for details

Supporting the Pathway BMS are several other web-sites eg Customer Service
site, SSC site: care needs to be exercised to avoid the over-proliferation of
material and the risks of duplication/contradiction/administrative workload
this entails

4.2 Document Management
Assessment Criteria : document control and approval

4.3 Programme
Assessment Crit

Excellent use of PVCS which is embedded into the project/business for all
internal and external documents. This is potentially an example of best
practice in Fujitsu Services

Excellent approach, facilitated by PVCS, for tracking and recording
comment/approval cycles of document production, supported by twice-daily
monitoring of outstanding items and quality control over material produced
Measurements include — document template errors; document approval time
(NB improved average from 21 days (July’01) to 10 days (Apr’02)); overdue
approvals/comments report

Adopted Fujitsu Service Risk Process for Network Banking opportunity
(nearing contract agreement now); being reviewed monthly

Viewed Network Banking Risk Plan v 0.17

Evidence of determination to control impact of change requests on the
business performance through, for example, agreeing assumptive views of
requirements and contracting for effort on a Time & Materials basis
Observation raised identifying need to revise related process material on
Pathway BMS to reflect use of corporate process

4.4 Business Development
Assessment Criteria: Supplier Management, Internal communication

Reviewed process by which Hypercom were eventually engaged for supply of
pin-pad solution (BP/PDN/004 - Service definition supplied by post office,

POL00000877

F/119.2/3
POL00000877
POL00000877

BD/PRP/004 - Request for Proposal supplied to Suppliers, NB/PRP/003 -
Proposal supplied to Post Office)

A formal well-documented approach was followed, including use of Supplier
Questionnaire and investigation of ISO9001 registration status of short-listed
suppliers

Observation raised identifying need to check supplier’s plan to achieve
registration to IS09001:2000 before mid-2003

Example of good practice is Business Development’s continued involvement,
subsequent to award of contract, to seek exploitation of additional business
opportunities

Reviewed Internal Communications activities which demonstrated full
compliance with Fujitsu Services policy/process regarding approvals by
business directors, customer and Press Office

Observation raised recommending subsequent inspection of the planned
implementation of a feedback / effectiveness review mechanism for internal
communications

4.5 Application Development
Assessment Criteria: process compliance, measurement, TickIT compliance,
improvement

APDU, which supports (4" line) live applications and develops new business
function applications (eg Network Banking, Debit Card Service), was visited
Opportunity has been taken to introduce to the Network Banking development
techniques which proved successful in a previous, smaller development (Key
Mgt System), especially in areas of development control, change control and
analysis of failures at different stages of test cycle

Detailed planning of tasks is done using AMS; records of estimates are
maintained and reviewed against actuals, with feedback into estimating of next
product development

It was noted that contention between the different demands of time recording
and development planning/review can lead to additional administrative effort.
Also the provision of the Level 3 plan to the customer has led to difficulties
and diversion from the main development task as a result of the reduced
flexibility in planning and resourcing this has caused

Measurements in place include — task achievement v. plan; actual v. estimated
workload; test progress v. plan; defects per module from integration test
onward

CP3161, reference NB/LLD/007 was followed from high-level design to unit
test record (through low level design, code and unit test plan). Document
control was evident. However although code review is “insisted on”, no record
of the code review of this particular module could be located. This was
subsequently located on the following day and reported to assessor, verified by
Jan Holmes.

There has been a focus established on measurement of test defects since April
2001, analysing by test cycle and seeking to identify causes of unexpected
volumes/reasons for defect. Currently investigation is underway into reason
for high number of “administrative” closures.

Use of Test Director has been implemented as an improvement in efficiency
and measurement since April 2002

F/119.2/4
POL00000877
POL00000877

= Observation raised identifying further opportunity to analyse ratio of
customer-found failures as opposed to PTU-found failures

4.6 Customer Service
Assessment Criteria: Customer satisfaction; measurement, analysis, corrective
action; linkage between support teams
= Whilst visiting this area, an example of good practice in the planning and
regular testing of business continuity procedures became evident
«The SSC (3™ line support) unit is located in a secure area and has effective,
intranet-based management control and information systems (ref CS/QMS/007
and CS/QMS/002 as well as local procedures and work instructions)
= Effective control of authorisation of Operational Correction Requests was
demonstrated through record of the item “Jsimpkins5924R”
= Relationship with 2™ line is good, based on frequent and regular contact and
improvement in 2" line filtration from ~50% to ~80% has been facilitated and
monitored by the SSC
= Relationship with Development is good, based on combination of Release Mgt
forum, development staff regularly on-site and having a specific development
contact who focuses on supportability of future releases
= Call ref 65470 traced from initial logging to present date.
= Performance of Customer Service is reviewed at monthly Service Review
Forum with the customer, using Service Review Book which contains reports
on every SLA (of which 124), future release schedule, alerts and text on
aspects of service
= A scorecard has been introduced from April 2002 and actions being taken on
low score areas are reviewed during this forum
= Asaresult of scorecard, an initiative has been introduced to improve the
Operational Base Change Forum
= Complaint and Problem management are effectively managed, although there
is no interface currently with the Fujitsu Services Customer Satisfaction
Support System

4.7 HR Management
Assessment criteria: closure of previous non-conformity, Performance +, Resource
Management
= It was observed that hard copy records are held in the department of last year’s
objectives, last year’s achievement review and current year’s objectives along
with a spreadsheet tracking completions against a target date
= 100% achievement of last year’s reviews was shown and tracking is underway
for registration of current year objectives by end-June
= Resource forecasting and management, with a focus on filling approved
vacancies and reducing number of freelancers was demonstrated; this is in
compliance with recently introduced change to method of control by Fujitsu
Services

Observation

Whilst 3“ party supplier Hypercom currently holds registration to IS$09001:1994, this
is likely to expire by mid-2003 unless they re-register to ISO9001:2000. The
supplier’s plans for re-registration should be verified or their ability and commitment
to ongoing quality management determined.

Observation

There is much good internal communications activity. Although intended, no action
has yet been taken to assess the effectiveness of the communications, for example by
requesting feedback. Initiating an appropriate feedback mechanism would support
analysis of effectiveness and drive possible improvement.

Observation

Use of PINICL gives access to a wealth of statistics on incidents, not only occurring
during testing by development but also from customer test and live operation. It is
suggested that it could be beneficial to analyse ratio of incidents found by customer
test/live use to those found by PTU testing as a possible indicator of areas for
improvement in the development process.
