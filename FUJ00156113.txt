Subject: Eliminating Track II from historical Audit log
Hello David,

My colleague Suzie Kirkham has asked me to write to you to set out our position in response to
request PSO_FSL_01762_FS.

In essence, the request is made up of two principal components, namely:

1) to address how Track II data can be removed from the Historical Audit logs and
1) to consider how such removal may impact prosecution cases where the data is used as
evidence.

The first component is a technical one where Fujitsu will be in a position to put forward an
appropriate proposal. The second element however falls outside of the scope of what Fujitsu is
able to offer as a service. To elaborate, it effectively amounts to Fujitsu giving a legal opinion on
evidentiary law. While this is something which undoubtedly needs to be evaluated from Post
Office’s perspective, it is not something which Fujitsu is prepared to provide.

Notwithstanding this, and for the avoidance of any doubt, please rest assured that Fujitsu is
willing to assist Post Office to help it evaluate the legal risks involved in the proposed removal.
However this could only be done on the strict understanding that any decision taken on the
matter would, ultimately, rest solely with Post Office.

I'm happy to discuss this further as need be.

Kind regards

Jean-Philippe
