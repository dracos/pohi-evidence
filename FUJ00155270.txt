Subject: Checking ARQ events

Although Mik's line is, very strongly, that SSC should have no formal responsibility for checking events :
connected with ARQs, in the short term he is happy for me to help with this on an informal basis (as I have
been doing already).

This may have to stop as SSC involvement with HNG-X increases, and will always be low priority.
