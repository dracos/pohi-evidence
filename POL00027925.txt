a Relationship), provided in each case such Decisions are within the scope of the relevant
Relationship’s responsibilities as described in Annex 1 to this Schedule A2 and such
Decision is recorded in accordance with paragraph 3.5.

Each Relationship shall be conducted through “meetings”, comprising, for the purposes

For any Decision of a Relationship to be effective and binding on the Parties, it must be
in writing and signed by the Subject Leads (or their fully empowered deputies) of that
Relationship.

At least once in every calendar year, the members of each Relationship shall discuss and
review whether the frequency with which their Relationship meetings are held should be

are established from time to time by the Parties, with a view to resolving them in a timely
manner.

Any operational issues which cannot be resolved in a timely manner in accordance with

opportunity.

The Parties agree to use their reasonable endeavours to make Decisions through timely
and effective communication through the appropriate Relationship and not to

GOVERNANCE FOR OPERATIONAL SERVICES AND THE TOWERS MODEL

Fujitsu Services acknowledges that the supplier that Post Office chooses as its Post
Office Service Integrator for the new Towers Model may act as Post Office's managing
partner. Subject to paragraphs 9.4 and 9.6 below, the Parties acknowledge and agree
that Post Office Service Integrator shall be entitled, on behalf of Post Office, to exercise
any rights or perform any obligations of Post Office under this Agreement, provided that
only Post Office shall be entitled to exercise its rights under Clauses 47, 58 and 66 of the
Agreement and paragraph 7 of Annex 2 to Schedule A2.

For the purposes of the Post Office Service Integrator performing its role as a managing
partner for the Post Office and subject to paragraphs 9.1 and 9.4, references in this
Agreement to Post Office shall be interpreted to refer to or include Post Office Service
Integrator as relevant. Post Office’s opinion shall prevail in the event of any dispute as to
whether a reference refers to or includes the Post Office Service Integrator. Delegation
to the Post Office Service Integrator shall be without prejudice to Post Office's right to
exercise its rights under any provision of the Agreement on its own behalf. For the
avoidance of doubt, nothing in this paragraph 9 is intended to create a separate contract
between Fujitsu Services and Post Office Service Integrator or to assign or novate this
Agreement or any part of it to Post Office Service Integrator.

In the event that Post Office appoints the Post Office Service Integrator to manage some
or all of its IT services on its behalf, Fujitsu Services shall perform all its obligations owed
to Post Office under this Agreement to the Post Office Service Integrator as if the Post
Office Service Integrator is Post Office. To the extent that Fujitsu Services fails to perform
its obligations under the Agreement, Post Office retains the ability to enforce its rights
against Fujitsu Services and require it to perform those obligations. In the event that
either Party considers co-operation and collaboration between Fujitsu Services, Post
Office Service Integrator and other Tower Contractors is not in accordance with this
paragraph 9, then either Party may escalate the issue through the Dispute Resolution
Procedure.

Without prejudice to Post Office’s right to exercise its rights under any provision of the
Agreement on its own behalf, in the event that Post Office Service Integrator exercises
the rights of Post Office under Clauses 23, 24 or 25 of the Agreement, Fujitsu Services
shall only be required to disclose details of the aggregated price of performing the
Services and not details of pricing for specific Services or details of the cost base it uses
to calculate such prices which may indicate Fujitsu Services’ pricing strategy or pricing
levels to Post Office Service Integrator.

Without prejudice to paragraph 9.1 above but subject to paragraph 9.6 below, the Parties
acknowledge and agree that Post Office Service Integrator shall be entitled to attend any
of the meetings described in this Schedule either in addition to Post Office or on behalf of
and as the representative of Post Office. The Post Office Service Integrator may in some
instances be the sole representative of Post Office at such meetings or governance
boards and will be responsible for the relationship relevant to those meetings or
governance boards. Where Post Office Service Integrator attends a meeting on behalf
of Post Office, Post Office Service Integrator shall be entitled to exercise such rights and

perform such obligations as Post Office would be entitled to exercise or perform at such
meeting.

Post Office shall ensure that it has a representative at the following governance boards
in addition to or instead of Post Office Service Integrator:

9.6.1 Executive Relationship;
9.6.2 Commercial Relationship; and
9.6.3 Acceptance Board Dispute.

As part of its transition to the Towers Model and in order to ensure the smooth and
effective delivery of end-to-end services to Post Office, Post Office may require its
suppliers of IT services to enter into good faith negotiations and agree non-disclosure
agreements with other Tower Contractors and/or other third parties (“NDA(s)”) and
operating level agreement(s) (“OLA(s)”) setting out each supplier's respective obligations
and dependencies to Post Office and each other supplier. Fujitsu Services shall, where
reasonably requested by Post Office, use its reasonable endeavours to enter into NDA(s)
and OLA(s) with Post Office Service Integrator and/or any Tower Contractors and/or any
other third parties within 3 months of such notification by Post Office. In the event that
Fujitsu Services has not or considers it will not be able to enter into NDAs and/or OLAs
within such 3 month timescale, Fujitsu Services shall promptly notify Post Office of any
issues preventing compliance with such 3 month timescale and the Parties shall work
together to address the issues in good faith within a reasonable timescale to be agreed
mutually. In the event that the Parties are unable to agree a reasonable timescale, either
Party may escalate the matter through the Dispute Resolution Procedure. For the
avoidance of doubt, Post Office shall not be a party to any such NDA or OLA.

Post Office may wish to make changes to the governance structure in this Agreement to
align with its new Tower Model and to implement changes associated with any OLA. All
such changes shall be managed as a change to the Agreement and implemented via the
Change Control Procedure. Fujitsu Services shall be entitled to charge for any additional
costs or risks as a result of changes to the existing governance structure in accordance
with the Change Control Procedure.

Fujitsu Services shall collaborate reasonably with Post Office Service Integrator and the
Tower Contractors by adopting Good Professional Practice in relation to collaborating and
co-operating with Tower Contractors to enable Post Office to maximize the benefit of the
strategic IT supply chain and optimal target operating model selected by Post Office for
its IT and change transformation programme including by:

9.9.1 responding to and following the Post Office Service Integrator's instructions,
including meeting all timescales, where provided in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement;

9.9.2 save as set out in the Agreement, reporting to the Post Office Service Integrator
as if it were Post Office;

9.9.3 co-operating with the Post Office Service Integrator where it seeks to manage
and resolve issues between the Tower Contractors including any Incidents;

9.9.4 providing the Services in accordance with collaboration requirements and
responsibilities set out in Schedule F.

For the avoidance of doubt, Fujitsu Services shall be entitled to charge Post Office for
its demonstrable additional costs in complying with this paragraph 9.9 which the Parties
shall agree through the Change Control Procedure to the extent to which such costs are
not covered by the (i) Charges relating to the other Services provided under this
Agreement and (ii) de minimis amount of time being equivalent to 15 man days of
additional effort (over and above those activities performed by Fujitsu Services prior to
the implementation of some or all of the Tower model) in any quarter (being January to
March, April to June, July to September and October to December) incurred by Fujitsu
Services in complying with this paragraph 9.9.

Fujitsu Services shall at all times work with Post Office and Post Office Service Integrator,
in good faith, to develop governance processes, collaboration arrangements and meeting
structures in relation to the provision of the Services in order to:

9.10.1 facilitate consistent management, reporting, and sharing of information between
Fujitsu Services, Post Office Service Integrator and Post Office (as applicable);
and

9.10.2 support and assist the delivery of the Services to Post Office and the delivery of
other relevant Tower services by Post Office Service Integrator and other Tower
Contractors, to Post Office.

The Fujitsu Subject Lead for the Executive Relationship (or a suitable alternative in terms
of seniority, decision making ability and knowledge of this Agreement) shall attend
meetings of the governance board entitled “Supply Chain Member Board” instituted under
the agreement between the Post Office Service Integrator and Post Office.

Annex 2 to Schedule A2

Dispute Resolution Procedures

INTRODUCTION
The Parties shall use the Dispute Resolution Procedure to resolve any Dispute.

There may, subject to the other provisions of this Annex 2 to Schedule A2, be up to five
stages (each a "Stage") to the DRP as follows:

1.2.1 the Subject Lead Review to be carried out in accordance with paragraph 2;
1.2.2 the Executive Review to be carried out in accordance with paragraph 3;

1.2.3. the Board Review (including facilitation by an expert) to be carried out in
accordance with paragraph 4;

1.2.4 provided that the Parties agree to such procedure, mediation (to be carried out in
accordance with paragraph 6) or expert determination (to be carried out in
accordance with paragraph 7); and

1.2.5 where any mediation does not resolve the Dispute or the Parties do not agree to
the use of mediation or expert determination, or as otherwise provided for in this
Agreement, resolution through the courts of England.

The Parties may relax the timescales referred to in the DRP by mutual agreement (such
agreement not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

SUBJECT LEAD REVIEW

Subject to paragraph 2.2, as soon as either Party becomes aware of a disputed matter it
shall refer the Dispute to the Subject Leads best qualified to deal with the Dispute (taking
into account the nature of the Dispute and the responsibilities of each Subject Lead) for
resolution within five Working Days of the date of referral (the “Subject Lead Review’). If
the Dispute relates to the interpretation of this Agreement or to the amount or terms of
invoices, then the Dispute shall be referred to the Commercial Relationship for resolution.

As soon as either Party becomes aware of a disputed matter in relation to the SIP it
shall refer the Dispute to Executive Review described in paragraph 3.

EXECUTIVE REVIEW

In the event that the Subject Leads of the Relationship to which the Dispute is referred
under paragraph 2 fail to resolve that Dispute, the Dispute shall be referred to the
Systems Integration Partnership and Executive Relationship for resolution in accordance
with this paragraph 3 (the "Executive Review"). Each Party shall, no later than five
Working Days after such failure (or as soon as reasonably practicable if the Dispute is in
relation to the SIP), provide the other with a Statement of Dispute. If the Parties agree to

do so, such statements may be provided sequentially by one Party responding to the
Statement of Dispute of the other.

The Subject Leads of the Systems Integration Partnership and Executive Relationship or
other individuals nominated by each Party suitably empowered to deal with executive
matters (the “Nominated Executives”) will be responsible for collating all relevant
information relating to the Dispute and for progressing the Dispute through the DRP until
itis resolved or determined.

The Executive Review shall take place within ten Working Days of the referral with the

Planning of Pre-Committed Resource

INNER CORE TEAM TO 31ST MARCH 2015

The Parties shall agree an Inner Core Team of resources for the period up to 31st March
2015 under the auspices of the Demand Planning Board. The Inner Core Team for such
period shall consist of those Fujitsu Services personnel who have specialist knowledge
and experience of the infrastructure and/or processes used to support Post Office's needs
under the Agreement and whose loss would cause a significant increase in cost or time
for the implementation of future change whilst new staff were trained in or re-discovered
that key knowledge.

The Inner Core Team for the period up to 31st March 2015 is initially set at 9 full time
posts covered by 12 people. Post Office shall have the final say on posts, skill sets and
who is included within the Inner Core Team from the list of candidates recommended by
Fujitsu Services but shall not unreasonably refuse candidates and shall provide reasons
where it reasonably refuses. The Demand Planning Board shall record in its minutes
which areas of the business Fujitsu Services feel is not sufficiently covered to enable
mitigation actions to be taken if necessary.

Limited changes: The Inner Core Team shall be fixed (in terms of variety of skill sets and
numbers of posts and persons) from the date of signature of CCN1271c and such
elements may not be varied prior to 31st March 2015 other than under the process set
out in paragraph 3 below in relation to skill sets only.

The additional provisions regarding the Inner Core Team set out in paragraphs 11 and 12
below shall apply with effect from 1st April 2015 except that paragraph 11 will not apply
in the event that the Inner Core Team is terminated by Post Office pursuant to paragraph
12 below.

OUTER CORE TEAM TO 31st MARCH 2015

The Parties shall agree an Outer Core Team of resources for the period up to 31st
March 2015 under the auspices of the Demand Planning Board. The Outer Core Team
shall consist of those Fujitsu Services personnel who have specialist knowledge and
experience of the infrastructure and/or processes used to support Post Office's needs
under the Agreement and whose loss would cause a significant increase in cost or time
for the implementation of future change whilst new staff were trained in or re-discovered
that key knowledge.

The Outer Core Team for the period up to 31st March 2015 is initially set at 15 full time
posts covered by 18 people. Post Office shall have the final say on posts, skill sets and
who is included within the Outer Core Team from the list of candidates recommended by
Fujitsu Services but shall not unreasonably refuse candidates and shall provide reasons
where it reasonably refuses. The Demand Planning Board shall record in its minutes

Schedule A2 Version 13.0
Page 21 of 27

POL00027925
POL00027925
CONFIDENTIAL

which areas of the business Fujitsu Services feel are not sufficiently covered to enable
mitigation actions to be taken if necessary.

c) Right to cancel Outer Core Team: Post Office shall have the right to cancel the Outer
Core Team effective from the second anniversary of signature of CCN1271c. Post Office
may exercise such option in writing to the Fujitsu Services Commercial Director up to 21
months from signature of CCN1271c only. If such break option is not activated, the
Outer Core Team shall continue in place as normal until 31st March 2015.

d) Limited Changes: The Outer Core Team shall be fixed (in terms of variety of skill sets
and numbers of posts and persons) from the date of signature of CCN 1271c and such
elements may only be varied:

i) in relation to numbers of persons and posts only, on Post Office giving 9
months’ notice after that date. Post Office shall not reduce the numbers of
persons and/or posts of the Outer Core Team as initially set by more than 20%
during the initial 2 years from signature of CCN1271c. During years 3-5 from
signature of CCN1271c, assuming Post Office has not invoked the break option
at point 2(b) above, Post Office may reduce the numbers of persons and/or
posts of the Outer Core Team by up to 20% in total of the size existing at the
second anniversary of signature of CCN1271c during the remainder of the Term
of the Agreement. Should Post Office not have utilised the full 20% reduction
during the initial 2 years, then the remaining balance is not carried over to the
3rd-5th years.

ii) In relation to skill sets only, under the process set out in point 3) below.
3. VARIATIONS TO SKILL SETS OF THE INNER AND OUTER CORE TEAMS:

a) Where forecast utilisation of a specified skill set within either the Inner Core Team or Outer
Core Team is less than 50% for three or more succeeding months, Post Office may request
at the Demand Planning Forum for that skill set to be exchanged for another skill set where
consistent demand is shown. Post Office may, after the first anniversary of signature of
CCN1271c, change 1 person in the Inner Core Team and 2 people within the Outer Core
team under this provision each year.

b) Where the replacement persons are from the Inner Core Team, the Outer Core Team or the
Standing Team, it is expected that Post Office will normally backfill that post, leaving the total
within each team unchanged. Post Office's rights in respect of team size reductions under the
other provisions of CCN1271c would be unaffected.

c) Post Office's entitlement to discounts will be unaffected by exchanges of personnel under this
paragraph.

d) Only in the event that the Post Office has requested the substitution, any re-skilling
requirements for the replacement resource will be chargeable to the Post Office provided that
Fujitsu Services shall take all reasonable endeavours to minimise the need for such re-
skilling.
