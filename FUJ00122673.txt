Hi Andy,
Please find updates/answers to the questions below in red.

1) Please provide details of any business testing carried out by the Post Office on the system before it
went live.

You would need to ask POL about this as we are only responsible for managing live service. Horizon has
undergone stringent testing before it was installed and as far as I am aware, no evidence exists of the
Horizon equipment ever being proven to have been responsible for anything untoward.

2) Please provide the service logs for the system at West Byfleet PO for a period commencing six months
prior to the defendant taking over as sub postmistress (30/06/2005) to the present day.

TfS was only installed in September 2007

3) Please confirm when and why the hardware in the system at west Byfleet PO has been changed.

I have asked for a full list of exchanges carried out at this branch and will provide these details when
I receive them.

4) By whom have these changes been made.

These exchanges will have been completed by Touch logistics who are our preferred third party supplier
for engineering services. They are purely hardware swaps following a standard set of processes.

5) when new hardware was installed at West Byfleet was it brand new or reconditioned All the Hardware is
reconditioned, we will replace any hard-drives that show as having bad blocks at repair and we scrap any
base units that are returned with the same fault three times. when kit_is sent back from any branch, it
has its memory wiped and a full software reload takes place. The install software is then installed, and
the base unit is then uniquely configured to the FAD code it is being installed at when it is_taken to
site by the engineer. A base unit will NOT work at any branch if it is simply taken from one location and
an attempted install is made at any other.

6) If it is the latter please confirm the identity of the PO from which the reconditioned hardware came
and why the hardware has been removed from that PO.

The location of the hardware being installed at this branch is not relevant as is is returned to repairer
prior to ever being sent out to a new branch and will undergo the tests and processes as described above.
