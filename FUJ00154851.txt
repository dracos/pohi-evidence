Dear Sirs

REGINA v SEEMA MISRA
GUILDFORD CROWN COURT
TRIAL — 3UT" NOVEMBER 2009

I understand from Prosecuting Counsel that on the last occasion Defence Counsel asked for Horizon data for the
period during which your Client was Subpostmistress.at West 8yfleet Sub Post Office: As you may be aware the
Horizon system is a product of Fujitsu Limited and the Post Office has purchased this system from Fujitsu in the
same way that any other company would purchase goods or services For its business. Other than.that Fujitsu is
not in any way an associated company of the Past Office.

The request has been put to Fujitsu and a reply has been received by the person who liaises with this company.

The data will take some 8-8 weeks to produce. Additionally your Client made. 107 calls to the Horizon Helpdesk
during her period of tenure which equates to roughly 2-3 calls per month. In order to provide the data Fujitsu
will wish to know exactly what is required end for exactly whet period. Please could you also advise as to why
you consider the data relevant. You will already hove the Notice of Additional Evidence from Andrew Dunks of
Fujitsu dealing with the calls to the Helpdesk:

The retrieval of data by Fujitsu is not a free service. It is very expensive and depends upon the amount of data
which has to be retrieved which is why you are requested to be very precise. At that stage a firm quotation can
be obtained and Counsel will be asked to give further advice as to disclosure and payment for this service. The
Past Office will not underwrite the cost if Counsel considers the date'ir"relevant. You will of; course be aware that
the same system operates throughout the country and was not particular to your Client's Sub Post Office.

I have set out the matter above quite clearly because in the past many thousands of pounds have been spent-on
obtaining this type of data subsequent to which a late plea of Guilty is tendered Which means that the exercise
has been a complete waste of time and money.

In view of the timescale please could you let me have your reply at your earliest convenience.

Yours faithfully
