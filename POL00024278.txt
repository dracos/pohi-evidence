1. Limitation is the legal jargon for where there is a time bar. As a rule of thumb most legal claims become time barred
after 6 years and cannot be the subject of court proceedings. There are ways to extend this period, notably where there
has been a fraud or where problems have been concealed by one party. Freeths are alleging both these points against
Post Office and a March 2019 hearing would therefore seek to decide whether there should be any extension. If not,
then we would expect the time barred claims to be struck out.

2. Noted.
3. The judge ordered the March 2019 hearing without consultation with the parties and without giving thought to what

it could be used for. We think that when he considers this more carefully he may decide that March 2019 is not a good
idea and so tabling an alternative option may help him reverse his previous view without embarrassment.

’'m supportive with a couple of questions to help my understanding:

1. Para 2.1— please clarify what “limitation issues” means

2. Para 2.1—cases that have been settled — in my opinion there will be a perception that they have not been
{particularly NT} ~ 1 appreciate this may be a matter of law, but no one should have any illusions here that this
will be accepted publicly ~ I just want to make sure that this is fully appreciated.

3. Para 3.1— what indications have we had the we suspect the judge wants to back track?
