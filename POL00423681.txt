Hi Hannah,

The number is being updated on the intranet — I think the problem arose because we used to share the line with Royal
Mail, and on one of the various updates to our intranet the wrong details were picked up.

The policy has been reviewed recently and is currently awaiting sign off. We also have a newly developed investigations
procedure which is also awaiting sign off.

We have had very few whistleblowing reports over the past year. There was one at the beginning of the year — I was not
terribly close to it, but my boss, Dave Mason, was more involved and should be able to advise you on the governance.

Thanks,

Georgina

Thanks Colin
Georgina - the auditors are asking the following questions please could you help me by providing the answers?
1. The whistleblowing helpline- this is being discussed with Georgina Blair, because the number shown in the
whistleblowing policy and on the intranet is not POL’s helpline, it is Royal Mail’s. Also the document for the

Whistleblowing Policy shows a date of 30/4/2012- is this not updated annually?

2. We need documentation to support that results from the whistleblowing helpline and follow up procedures are
provided to the audit committee.
Kind Regards
