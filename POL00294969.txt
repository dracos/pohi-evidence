I thought we (Mike) had already written to PE re this?
\'m getting irritated because I'm told we know there is no issue; but also concerned as this gets more exposure.

Shane what's your advice?
Should we have Fujitsu respond?

Thx Paula

Thought you might like to note this, in Private Eye 28 October:

“Fujitsu what a stinker

The Post Office’s Horizon computing system has made so many “bizarre discrepancies and unexplained shortfalls”
that many subpostmasters have been prosecuted for theft and false accounting or financially ruined through the civil
courts. Now 85 subpostmasters are planning to take legal action against the Post Office.”
