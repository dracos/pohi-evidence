Dear Ben

Congratulations on your appointment to the Post Office Ltd Board of Directors. To introduce myself, I
am CEO of the National Federation of SubPostmasters (NFSP) - the representative body for
subpostmasters who own and operate post offices across the UK. I was a subpostmaster myself for 22
years before taking over as NFSP CEO in 2018.

The NFSP welcomed the announcement in July that Government will be making interim payments
of up to Â£100,000 to those whose criminal convictions relied on Horizon data and have been quashed,
ahead of final compensation settlements being agreed with them. The NFSP believes that every
victim of the Horizon scandal should be fairly compensated.

However, we are concerned to hear emerging reports that Post Office Ltd has refused to make
interim payments to several eligible individuals. I am therefore writing to request further information
on this issue.

If it is the case that Post Office Ltd is refusing interim payments, what is the justification for this? Is
this an interim position and these individuals can expect payment in future? Are there delays relating
to the vacant position previously occupied by Declan Salter?

The NFSP will be opposed to any impediment to the fair compensation of victims of the Horizon
scandal - as will many other stakeholders. At this stage we would like to understand Post Office Ltd's
position on the issue.

I hope to hear from you soon. I would be very happy to speak if you feel it would be helpful.

Yours Sincerely

Calum Greenhow
CEO, NFSP
