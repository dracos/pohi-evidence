D CROWN COURT TRIAL - ISTH

Jarnail,
Thanks for the information, which I've now read through.

I think I can summarise the situation as follows:

1.Ms Misera says initially identified that the sub post office was short of
cash by about £80 - £90K

2. She tried to cover this up while she repaid the loses which she thought
was due to staff theft

3. By the time of the audit in Jan 2008 she was £73K short suggesting she

POL00175839

had made good about £10K of the losses

4, When she went to court, she saw an article in Computer Weekly indicating
that Horizon was unreliable and decided to jump on the bandwagon.

5. Note that there is no evidence to support any of the cases referenced in
the Computer Weekly articles and there is case law showing the reliability

of Horizon. (The case of Marine Drive which I think was referred to in the
Computer Weekly article.)

However I don't see how anything here changes the fact that she falsified
the accounts or that money was missing.

What I still don't understand is exactly what it is that the defence is

claiming in terms of where exactly Horizonmight have "lost" this money
rather than her or her staff stealing it. Therefore unless we can get a

clear statement as to exactly what is being looked for and when the system

allegedly made mistakes, I don't thinkthere is anything I can do. (I do
appreciate that it is up to the Prosecution to prove Horizon is reliable
rather than the defence to prove it isn't, but it is always difficult to

prove that there are no errors - particularly over such a long period of
time.)

Surely it is down to the Post Office investigators to get to the bottom of
exactly where there is anything in dispute. At that point I might be able

to assist with some technical knowledge to help interpret the various logs
to support such areas of dispute.

I'll leave Penny to continue the discussions she is currently having with
the Post Office investigators until there is something concrete for me to
investigate.

Regards

Gareth
