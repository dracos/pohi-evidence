3. Horizon Shortfall Scheme (HSS)

Post Office Ltd received 2,417 eligible claims by March 2021.

The closure date for applications was 27 November 2020, but Post Office
Ltd continued to accept applications for the original deadline group up to
March 2021.

In October 2022, the government announced that additional funding would
be provided so that eligible late claimants could receive financial redress,
and the scheme reopened for applications.

Post Office Ltd has received 6,772 eligible late claims to date.

Interim payments on the HSS are available before and after claimants
receive an offer of redress.

The £454 million paid out on the HSS includes £33.7 million in interim
payments to original claimants and £9.7 million in interim payments to late
applications.

On 13 March 2024, the government announced that all
eligible HSS claimants would be entitled to a fixed sum award of £75,000 to
settle their claim.

Post Office Ltd has also started to make payments of the full £75,000 fixed
sum award to HSS applicants who have not previously received redress but
have now accepted this offer. The number and amount of offers and
payments made for the full fixed sum are now included in the HSS figures
below and in the HSS eligible late claims figures on the ‘Claim data by
scheme’ table. As of 31 March 2025, approximately £193 million has been
paid in fixed sum awards.

Post Office Ltd continues to make top-up payments to claimants who had
previously accepted a full and final offer below the value of £75,000, to bring
their total redress to £75,000. As of 31 March 2025, approximately £106
million has been paid in top-ups to previously settled claimants.

3.1 Eligible claimant stages

As of 31 March 2025, 9,189 claims for financial redress have been received
via the Horizon Shortfall Scheme. This includes applications received before
RLITOO00600
RLITO000600

the original deadline, and applications received since the scheme reopened
in October 2022.

Of the total 9,189 claims received, 5,054 have been paid and a further 130
have accepted offers and are awaiting payment. Another 856 claimants are
currently in receipt of offers that they have not yet accepted and the
remaining 3,149 claimants are awaiting offers from Post Office Ltd.

4. Overturned Convictions (OC)

Initial interim payments are available to eligible postmasters upon getting
their conviction overturned on the grounds that it was reliant on Horizon
evidence.

As of 31 October 2024, all 111 eligible claimants have either reached full
and final settlement or received a minimum of £200,000 through interim
payments.

A full and final claim is defined as:
RLITO000600
RLITO000600

e both non-pecuniary and pecuniary claims have been received and
sufficiently particularised to substantiate redress payments of £450,000 or
more

¢ or the claimant has requested the £600,000 fixed sum offer

Post Office Ltd has been progressing non-pecuniary settlements first to get
money to postmasters as quickly as possible, which means a number of
partial settlements have been reached in addition to the full and final
settlements published here. Post Office Ltd continues to work on finalising
these outstanding claims.

Any individual with a conviction overturned by the Post Office (Horizon
System) Offences Act 2024 or the Post Office (Horizon System) Offences
(Scotland) Act 2024 will be eligible to seek financial redress via the Horizon
Convictions Redress Scheme (HCRS).

4.1 Full and final claimant stages

As of 31 March 2025, there are 111 claimants eligible for financial redress
through the OC scheme. From these 111, Post Office Ltd has received 86
full and final claims.

5. Group Litigation Order (GLO) scheme

Out of the 555 who were members of the Group Litigation Order, 63
postmasters had convictions and are therefore eligible to apply for redress
once their conviction has been overturned. If their conviction has been
overturned by the courts, they are eligible under the Overturned Convictions
(OC) Scheme. If their conviction has been overturned by the legislation,
they are eligible for the Horizon Convictions Redress Scheme (HCRS).

As of 31 March 2025, of the 492 members of the GLO group, 282 people
have already been paid full and final redress. Another 90 have challenged
the offer made to them but have received 80% of it as an interim payment,
and a further 2 have agreed to a full and final settlement and are in receipt
of an 80% interim payment. This means that in total, 374 members of the
group (76%) have therefore received substantial redress (defined as either
full and final or 80% interim redress payments).

The remaining claims are at the various stages listed below:

¢ 3 have agreed full and final redress but are awaiting payment
RLITOO00600

RLITOO00600

e 18 have challenged offers but are awaiting their 80% interim payment

e 14 have submitted a full claim and are awaiting an offer of redress

e 19 claims had been submitted but were incomplete

e 9 submitted claims had not yet been fully reviewed to confirm

e 18 claims had not yet been submitted

5.1 Full and final claimant stages

There are 492 claimants eligible for financial redress through

the GLO scheme. As of 31 March 2025, 446 full and final claims have been
received. For full and final claims received, the number reported refers to all
claims assessed as complete. Further claims may have been received
recently but not yet assessed to determine whether they are complete. A
claim initially assessed as complete may subsequently be found to require
further information and therefore be removed from counts of complete
claims received while awaiting this information.

5.2 Scheme delivery targets

The Department for Business and Trade (DBT) is committed to a target of
making a first offer to 90% of claimants who have submitted a full claim
within 40 working days. A full claim is defined as a claim which the
department considers, with advice from its legal advisors, does not need
any further evidence in order to assess every element of the claim. Should
the department consider further evidence is needed in order to make a full
RLITO000600
RLITO000600

assessment, the 40 working day target will not start until such time that the
required evidence is received from the claimant or any other source.

Over the lifetime of the scheme to 31 March 2025, 89.6% of claimants
received their first offer within 40 working days of submitting a full claim.

DBT’s target is providing a substantive response within 40 working days to
90% of claimants who submit a complete challenge from 1 December 2024.
A challenge will be considered ‘complete’ if the department does not require
any more information from the claimant or their advisors in order to provide
a substantive response. A substantive response is defined as the claimant
receiving a revised offer or a decision to uphold the original offer.

As of 31 March 2025, 90% of claimants (36 out of 40) who submitted
complete challenges after 1 December received their substantive response
within 40 working days of doing so. Claims are being assessed in the date
order in which they were submitted, so no challenge submitted before 1
December will be left behind.

5.3 £75,000 fixed payment impact

Due to changes made in January 2024, all eligible GLO claimants are now
offered the option to settle their claims on a full and final basis for a total
fixed sum of £75,000 inclusive of interest, instead of making a claim for their
individual losses.

This means that the claim would not be assessed by the department against
the process set out in the guidance and principles
(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/compensation-scheme-for-group-
litigation-order-case-postmasters).

Any payments received from the department to date or from
the GLO settlement will be deducted from the £75,000 before payment is
made.

As of 31 March 2025, 287 offers have been accepted, of which 155 are
offers of the £75,000 fixed payment. Of those who have accepted the
£75,000 fixed payment, four-fifths are new claims and a fifth had previously
accepted offers.

6. Horizon Convictions Redress Scheme
(HCRS)
RLITO000600
RLITO000600

The Post Office (Horizon System) Offences Act 2024 and the Post Office
(Horizon System) Offences (Scotland) Act 2024 quashed Horizon-related
convictions on a blanket basis in June 2024, according to a set of criteria in
the Acts, covering each UK nation.

On 30 July 2024, the UK government announced the launch of the Horizon
Convictions Redress Scheme (HCRS) (https://www.gov.uk/guidance/horizon-
convictions-redress-scheme-hcrs-applying-for-financial-redress), delivered by the
Department for Business and Trade, to provide financial redress to
postmasters across the UK who had their convictions quashed by the Acts.

Applicants have begun registering for the HCRS and the department is
working with the relevant justice authorities to confirm individual applicants’
eligibility for the scheme.

Eligible applicants have a choice of 2 routes to redress: they can either
accept a fixed and final sum of £600,000, or they can choose to submit their
application to a detailed assessment process.

All eligible applicants are entitled to an initial interim payment of £200,000.

The department is now publishing data on settlements, broken down by
initial interim payments and full and final settlements.

6.1 Full and final claimant stages

As of 31 March 2025, 339 full and final claims for financial redress have
been received via the HCRS. All these 339 claims have received payment.
