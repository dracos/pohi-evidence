UKGI Board readout Sept19

- Alex Chisholm spoke of a disconnect between POL’s Board and BEIS. This had
‘shaken our confidence’. Highlighted the issue around STIP bonus payments in the
summer, as well as the handling of the litigation.

- Big discussion about changing culture. Changing culture is difficult, requires hard
work and persistence and commitment from the top.

- Nick R will need executives who are committed to it

- Are the Board up for it? Is the chair?

- An opportunity to use the litigation as a ‘burning platform’ to change the company

- Board suggested agreeing top priorities for the company and have these
communicated by Alex Chisholm to Tim P. Should go through the chair, not the
CEO

- Very little discussion of the operational performance of the company, though Alex C
did note the improved financial performance.
