3. Introduction

Training Feedback Committee is the key forum for the discussion and coordination of activities in relation to feedback
received about branch training. It provides structure and accountability for any feedback that requires training
collateral or methods of training to be improved.

4. Objectives

e Ensure Postmaster and colleague feedback is captured, analysed and actioned where appropriate.
e Develop a strategic approach to improvements in training.

e Provide a forum for discussion and agreement on recommendations or areas for improvement.

e Identify risks to any areas as a result of feedback provided.

e To review and refine the mechanisms used to capture feedback.

5. Scope

The committee will consider all aspects of the feedback and related activities to the extent that it aims to take a ‘bird's
eye view’ of current practices and material. The feedback could come from a number of sources and any actions
taken because of the feedback will be documented in a central feedback improvements log.
