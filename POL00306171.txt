Andy,

I'm still not comfortable with how this is set out. I have redrafted the letter to reflect how I would like the
agreement to work — would you review please and let me have your thoughts. I haven't carried these
changes through to the reply slip. If what I’m suggesting is workable would you make the necessary
amendments to the reply slip.

Thanks,
Angela

Please find attached the draft letter to Gina Griffiths for your review. Having given this some thought, the proposal we
discussed is actually a bit tricky from a legal perspective.

Under a normal NT payment, the SPMR signs the offer letter and enters into a binding contract to transfer their
branch. That letter puts various obligations on the SPMR. When the branch transfers, the NT payment is made.

In Griffiths’ case we are putting no obligations on Gina (she is not obliged to sell the branch and is not obliged to waive
her claims). The law therefore sees POL's offer to make a payment as a gratuitous promise as POL is getting nothing
in return. The effect of this is that although the offer in the attached letter is stated to remain open for 6 months, that is
not binding on Post Office and, as a matter of law, Post Office could revoke this offer at any time. To make the offer
legally irrevocable either:

1. The agreement needs drawing up by way of formal legal deed; or
2. Some obligation needs to be placed on Gina (thereby making the offer not gratuitous as POL will be
immediately getting something in return).

To be clear, although the offer can be revoked by POL, if Gina fulfils all the conditions in the letter before the offer is
revoked, a binding contract will then be formed (as in fulfilling the conditions, Gina will have agreed to waive her
claims which makes the offer not gratuitous) and POL will be legally obliged to pay the NT payment.

I appreciate that in practice POL would not withdraw the offer but if Gina has a sharp lawyer they may spot the fact
that the offer can be revoked at any time. Nevertheless, the attached is best solution I can create without going down
route 1 or 2 above.

I've cc'd Rodric given that this one raises a few techy legal points.

Kind regards
Andy
