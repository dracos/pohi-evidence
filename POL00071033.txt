From: Stephen Dilley

We are working to a timetable of exchanging witness statements on 15 September 2006 with
Mr Castleton's solicitors.

I have spoken to most of those who we've identified as either potential or actual witnesses and
am meeting several of you over the course of next week as part of the information gathering
exercise. I'm also preparing and amending witness statements.

Counsel, Richard Morgan, would like a conference with all our potential witnesses before
exchange is due. This is a good idea as it will enable you to ask any questions you may have
about the trial process, get to meet Richard before the trial and enable us to drill down on the
key issues. We have booked the conference to commence at 11am, on Monday 11
September 2006 at Maitland Chambers. The address is:

7 Stone Buildings
Lincoln's Inn
London WC2A 3SZ

You can find a map of chambers on http://www.maitlandchambers.com/contactus,

Please can I ask that you attend on the 11th.

If you have any queries in the meantime, I am contactable next week on : GRO H

Kind regards.
Stephen Dilley
