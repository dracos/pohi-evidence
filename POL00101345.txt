Thanks! I did expect it and it was exactly what I think and said to my friends.
I was (as I said) simply wanting to make sure we understand the impact even as we manage it as best we
can. Not one of our colleagues flagged the reputational impact - we just congratulated you (well
deserved) on a job well done.
It is my job to ask the hard questions even as I admire my execs for how they do their jobs!
No need to come back or cut short Mark.
Thanks, Paula

not comment on a leaked report as it is confidential and not in interests of applicants to break that -
but that we have confidence in Horizon. We needed this latter line because of the inaccuracies in the
coverage.

opportunity to express our significant concern at the leak at the working group.

stage.

present the picture the journalists wish to present - that of the corporate beast trampling on the
downtrodden Subpostmaster. This kind of campaigning journalism is always likely to capture sympathy and
its why they do it that way. For the reasons set out above it wouldn't be in our interests to get into a
detailed debate on the report.

>> Significant comments this am from friends who heard the coverage and were taken in. We need to be
careful we are not becoming too close to the issues, learning to cope with the internal stress and not
seeing the wider impact. Familiarity etc etc
>> Not sure if that means we would do anything differently in our response but we should think about it.
My commuting friends were surprised when I explained our side and felt the BBC had not covered it well at
all; and, felt aggrieved on our behalf. I was challenged as to what we do about the poor journalism.
(Alice may want to take a view, if it is poor.)
>> I'd like to see both the transcript and the statement we issued together - if you're around at 10am,
it would be good to grab 5 mins?
