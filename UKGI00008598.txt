Richard / Josh

The minister has asked for “an update/views on the litigation for next week? I presume the legal team will
have to consider the settlement in slower time? Can you confirm whether POL have shared their legal
advice yet?”

What would you advise we say in response?

‘Watson, Richard - UKG!

Hi all,

With thanks to Richard for putting this together, please find attached a readout on the recent Post Office litigation
meeting.

One of the actions from the meeting was for POL to share its legal advice with the BEIS legal team in order for the
Department to reach its own conclusions on any potential settlement. Kelly has since raised this with me again and
has asked for an update from UKGI officials on their perspective on the progress of the litigation and how the meeting
went.

Tom — would your team be able to provide an update/views on the litigation for next week? I presume the legal team
will have to consider the settlement in slower time? Can you confirm whether POL have shared their legal advice yet?

Many thanks,
Sam
