Preparation of the Executive Summary (Conduct Record)

1. Introduction

1.1 The aim of this document is to provide Investigators within the Royal
Mail Group, with clear guidance concerning the required Procedures
and Standards in relation to the above subject.

The purpose of the Executive Summary is to provide the Conduct
Manager with a summary of the investigation carried out and
additionally to provide first and early notification of the
investigative activity to Head of Investigations (HOI), Business Unit
Decision Managers (BUDM) and the “Esum” mailing group.

2. General

2.1 An Executive Summary is required in all cases where a person is
suspended from duty or bailed and/or charged by Royal Mail
Investigators, Police or another investigation agency following an
interview under caution and where the matter relates to suspected
offences committed against the Royal Mail Group. Also, where an
external offender is interviewed under caution an Executive Summary
is required in all cases.

2.2 The report should contain no more than the salient facts and flow
from the initial report of suspected offences through to the
conclusion of the interview and consequent action. As a guide it is
anticipated that for most Theft/Intentional Delay enquiries the
report text will fill no more than one page (A4).

2.3 A separate Executive Summary is required for each suspect offender
reported. In cases where more than one suspect offender is involved
elements of the report will undoubtedly be the same, however, care
should be taken to ensure that the ‘Interview/Searches’ and
‘Concluding Actions’ elements are person specific.

2.4 The completed Executive Summary should be emailed to all
interested parties but must include:

Conduct Manager (internal suspect offenders only)

Head of Investigations or equivalent

Business Unit Decision Maker

Commercial Security Manager (Only required when product affected
relates to ‘Top x’ Client)

2.5 Remember that a copy of the conduct report may be made available to
the interviewee. Investigators should therefore ensure that the
information provided is checked for relevance and is not simply a
‘cut and paste’ exercise from other documents prepared during the
enquiry, i.e. PORA/RIPA.

2.6 Use:
Font: Chevin Light
Style: Normal
Font size: point 12
Spacing: Single

2.7 The text should follow immediately after the preamble and typing
should commence immediately underneath the section headings
