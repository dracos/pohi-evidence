Thanks Jane — sorry for being a plodding lawyer earlier, I just wanted to be make sure that we'd tested this to breaking
point given its importance.

Andy, Amy

I’m happy with this wording other than the following tiny point - I think the ‘heading’ to 1.3.4 should be
‘Administrator access to databases’.

Many thanks for your patience on this, and I look forward to hearing that Tony, Deloitte & FJ are happy with this.
Kind regards,

Jane
