This document reflects the live changes for release
05.00.01. The changes are always a matter of
changing certain gathered shares to the dummy
gatherer so that they are no longer actively gathered.
In all cases the changes to this document are in
automatically generated tables. For this reason the
document is not diffmarked because diffmarking in
these circumstances just shows that the entire table
has changed which is not useful.

The following subpoints change to the dummy gatherer
in the IRE11 configuration file —

810, 811, 812, 813, 958, 880, 881, 882, 883 and 944.

The following subpoint changes to the dummy gatherer
in the IRE19 configuration file —

624.

The following subpoints change to the dummy gatherer
in the IRE19 disaster recovery configuration file —

810, 811, 812, 813, 624, 958, 880, 881, 882, 883 and
944

The unused share \\pnas002\NAS_MSHS$\MAEARC is
to be deleted to save space.

PC0208711

Eliminate IRE19's only actively gathered sub-point.

PC0208681

Change the PCONOO5 share to the dummy gatherer.

PC0206068

Change some shares that are being deleted to the
dummy gatherer.

Add WaitSecsForTermination to the GENERAL and
SEALER sections.

Whilst investigating PC0223655 it was discovered that
the sealer only did a forced termination in the case of
not closing down tidily after 6,000 minutes instead of
the anticpated 6 minutes due to a programming error.
To fix this PEAK this was changed but in a
configurable manner just in case it was discovered that
6 minutes was too short. In fact the value has been
initially set at 10 minutes. Hence new configuration
values were added to ConfigurationFile. txt.

Term Definition

Bootle This was the name of the old audit server which is now replaced by Iprparc001 at
IRE11. It was located in Bootle. Its name is still relevant because some data is
‘stored from there and will be stored for another 7 years after its decommissioning.
In addition Bootle and its initial letter B are used in various places to denote
Iprparc001 even now — for example in some of the renaming policies defined it is
used as part of the resultant file name which is stored

Eternus High capacily computer used to actually store the files archived.

Wigan This was the name of the old audit server which is now replaced by Iprparc002 at
IRE19. It was located in Wigan. As in Bootle above Wigan and its initial letter W are
still used in places now.

0.7 Changes Expected

In general new versions will be produced when new audit server configuration files are introduced.

4 Audit File Naming Structures

4.1 Name Structure

The audit file naming structure is :-

<FNV>_<AP>_<ASP>_<Siteld>_<Info>_<Date>_<DateSubIndex>_<CV>.<ext>

The file name components are sourced as follows :-

Component Details

FNV Sourced from FNVariant of configuration file and set to
FNO1

AP Sourced from Identifier of the Audit Point being gathered in
the configuration file

ASP Sourced from Identifier of the Audit Sub Point being
gathered in the configuration file

Siteld Sourced from Siteld in the configuration file and set to W
(Wigan or IRE19) or B (Bootle or IRE11)

Info Sourced from detail held in the renaming policy for the file
being gathered. Defaults to ~ if there is renaming to the Info
component
Length is between 1 and 64 characters

Date Date in CCYYMMDD format sourced from gathered file
name, or generated by details in the renaming policy

DateSubindex Sourced from detail held in the renaming policy for the file
being gathered, or generated by the renaming policy

cv Sourced from ContentVariant in the configuration file and
set to V001

ext Sourced from gathered file as defined in the renaming
policy

Note that whilst applying the renaming policy the constant MAX_INFO_SIZE is often tested for and if
exceeded the file is renamed using default renaming — see section 4.3 “Default Naming”. The current

value of MAX_INFO_SIZE is 65.

renaming policy (as it does not conform to the agreed construct) then a default filename will be

5 Audit Configuration

5.1 Configuration File Overview

The configuration file, which controls the operation of the Audit server, is comprised of a number of
sections:

¢ General control details

« Delete module control

¢ Sealer module control

e Hoarder module control (historic, the Hoarder component is now longer used in HNG-X)
« Retriever module control

« Scheduling Points

e Gatherer configuration details.

« Tape Poo! details (largely historic)

¢ Audit Point details

« Sub point details

The five control sections are independent of each other, but the latter five sections are interrelated as
show in the following diagram

5.11 Audit Points & Subpoints
5.11.1 Introduction

This section describes the Audit Points and Subpoints to enable the Audit Configuration file to be created
/ maintained.

Each of the audit point subsections of the document is structured hierarchically into
Audit Point (level 1)
Audit Sub Point 1 (level 2)
Audit Sub Point 2

Where Audit sub Points are mirrored on platforms on each Campus (Bootle/IRE11 and Wigan/IRE19)
they are only shown once with details for each campus.

5.11.2 Audit Point Details

An Audit Point is the logical point at which an Audit Track is generated.
The following details are held:

Configuration Item Description

Audit Point Number Numeric reference for the Audit Point within the
configuration file.

Identifier The name of the Audit Point. Maximum length 6
characters.

TapePoollndex The Tape Pool used by the audit point. See §5.8.

Use of Tape Pools is historic. This parameter
defines the data retention Policy for the Audit

Point:
1: 7 years

5.11.3 Audit Sub Point Details

An audit sub point is the physical location where files are gathered for Audit purposes. The applications
that form the Pathway system are responsible for making files available at an Audit Sub Point for
gathering by the Audit Server.

The following details are held: -

Configuration Item Description

Sub Point Number Numeric reference for the Sub Point within the configuration file.

Identifier The name of the Audit sub point. Maximum length 32 characters.

AuditPointindex The reference number of the associated Audit Point within the Audit
Configuration file

GathererIndex The reference number of the associated Gatherer within the Audit
Configuration file

ShareName The UNC path to the share from where the data is gathered.

DeletionPolicy This represents the time that the audit server will delete an audit track from

the remote share from where it was gathered.
The deletion policy is expressed as: HOARD+nnnn

where HOARD represents the time at which the audit track was written to
the Audit Eternus and nnnn represents minutes after the HOARD time.

e.g. HOARD+2880 would mean that an audit track can be deleted after 2
days.

Note that this parameter sets a minimum deletion time delay. In practice,
dependent upon the timing of schedules, an audit track may not be deleted
for up to 24 hours after the DeletionPolicy time expires.

RenamingPolicy The renaming policy which will be applied to all audit tracks gathered at this
subpoint. See §4.2
DelayInHours Gatherers will not gather a file immediately it appears within an audit share.

A file will not be gathered until at least ‘DelaylnHours’ hours after the files
modification time.

This is a fail safe mechanism to avoid gathering files that are still being
appended to.

Exclude Any file whose suffix (e.g. tmp) matches this parameter will not be

gathered.

The purposes of this is to enable audit data sources to build up an audit
track within the audit share without any danger of an incomplete file being
gathered by the audit server. When the audit data source determines that it
has completed writing the audit track it can rename the file to change the
suffix to something other than the excluded suffix. It will then be candidate
for gathering.

TransferData Determines whether the audit server will replicate data from this subpoint to
the other audit server/Eternus.

In practice all subpoints have this parameter set to yes with the exception of
Riposte data gathered from the Horizon Correspondence servers (TMS
Audit Point)

PreCompress Indicates whether data is already compressed at the originating platform
Possible values for this are

NONE No data compression is applied at source. The audit server will
compress/decompress the data prior to writing/after retrieving from Eternus.
The MD5 seal check is applied to the uncompressed data.

GZIP Data is compressed at source using gzip compression. The audit
server will not compress the data again before writing to Eternus. The MD5
seal calculation will be applied to the compressed data. The data will be
automatically gunzip’d (after seal checking) upon retrieval.

In practice GZIP is only used for Branch Database counter audit data.
