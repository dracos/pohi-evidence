We have developed a specific service review framework for Network Banking which we will be sharing with all the NB
suppliers and hopefully getting their agreement to - this should be signed off by the beginning of next week after which I
will send you a copy. With regards to the wider overarching framework for service review this is currently being
overhauled to include Stock Ops which as you know have just become a part of Network Support - target date for this is
the end of June. Once this is agreed we will then incorporate the NB one into it so we have a full picture across Network
Support and all suppliers.

If you need a copy of the NB one before it is signed off let me know and I will send one across.

Weekly Stats Reporting - re your e-mail earlier today. Apologies for this - unfortunately I didn't get copied into last
weeks report as I was on leave but my understanding was that the full set of information was being supplied. I am trying
to ensure that this weeks is fully populated which is dependant on lan Speck having the POEx info sorted out. I will take
up the issue with Richard Poulton re an interim solution to the call coding issue.

I will let you know tomorrow morning if there are any problems.

Sue,

as you know all the current Service Review Forums sit within the framework that your team own. What stage is the new
framework at ?

Kevin.
