Absolutely not a problem — I will ask Helen to keep this date free and support (subject to conclusion of the
court case) and although Chris is currently engaged in a mini project with Crime Risk I will ask that he acts
as stand in.

Subject: Cartwright King support

Allison,

Before Christmas I was asked to see if I could organise some specific training for Cartwright King solicitors on the
Horizon system and how this fits into our prosecutions. I allocated this to Stuart Pilgrim as he’s best placed in my team
to manage the training of the horizon system, He’s managed to arrange the training side of things from Chesterfield
training suite on 23 January 2012. Whilst Stuart has all the Horizon skills needed to talk through the system he lacks
the long term investigative experience required to potentially answer some of the solicitors questions about how cases
are prepared using the evidence. I’ve spoken provisionally to Helen Dickinson as her experience in this area is well
known, and asked if she could be available for the event. She advised me that she has a court case the week before
but would hope to be available and would like to help.

Would you be ok with her assisting in this piece.
