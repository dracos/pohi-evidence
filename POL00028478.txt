Subject Continued Acceptance Incident monitoring

You will no doubt be aware that acceptance of the Pathway systems was not achieved last week and that
we have entered a second acceptance phase of some four weeks duration.

During this period, the live trial will continue and there will be rollouts to more new outlets. Towards the
end of September, there will be a second acceptance decision. This will take (a) account of agreements
reached between now and then on the rectification plans and timetables for outstanding medium-severity
incidents, (b) monitoring of existing acceptance incidents (against critical success criteria in the case of
the medium/high severity incidents) and (c) the emergence of relevant new acceptance incidents.

In connection with (c) there are conditions attached as to what may count or not count as a new
acceptance incident and I will pass on further guidance along these lines shortly. However, in the

meantime, could you please note the need to recommence your live trial monitoring and reporting
activities in respect of:

activity at the outlets; TIP; transaction processing; HAPS and implementation/rollout/training.

Could you please confirm that you are (or will be) monitoring existing incidents and sending the results to
the incident champion.

The nine incidents in dispute for one reason or another are 218, 298, 314, 369, 372, 376, 378, 391 and
408.

Could you send any new acceptance incidents to me (Jeff Austin) and Altea Walker.

If you need any more information about the above, please contact me, Altea or Charlie Stringer. I will be
at the workshop at Renaissance Hotel near Heathrow on 25th and 26th.

Our office telephone numbers are,

Subject Acceptance Incident Workshop 25 and 26 August
All,

It seems my last e-mail is unclear regarding who from POCL should be attending Day 1 of the workshop.
The Day 1 POCL attendees are limited to :

Keith Baines
John Meagher
Min Burdett
Ruth Holleran
Jeremy Folkes
Jeff Austin

Day 2 attendees will be the same as Day 1 plus Steve Grayston, Andy Radka and the technical and
business experts called upon by the champions for Al 218, 298, 376, 378 and 408. However, the Day 2
agenda is subject to agreement at the end of Day 1 so this may alter.

I can now confirm that both days of the workshop will be held in the Caravelle Suite at the Renaissance
Hotel.

Regards,
_Tony Houghton
