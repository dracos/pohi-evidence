No evidence of failure in Horizon or POL procedures.

POL's position is that the loss was caused by human error or theft; the
losses were deliberately concealed from POL by the Applicant, who
admitted in interview that she inflated the reported cash figures to conceal
the losses in branch.

Second Sight's view is that “the root cause of the losses arising in this
branch, is that the Applicant had allowed her staff member full and
unsupervised access to the branch and to the safe...This opportunity to
access all of the cash... presented that employee with a perfect

opportunity to commit theft”.

Is there the possibility of an unlawful termination claim because the
Applicant's contract was not terminated on the required notice?

No. The Applicant was suspended immediately following the audit on 31
May 2006 and either resigned or was dismissed before pleading guilty to
false accounting in January 2007.

Was contract termination unlawful?

Given the Applicant's guilty plea and subsequent imprisonment, we do not
consider that the Applicant would have any claim in respect of
termination.

branch as a going concern if given 3 months’ notice?

Suitability for mediation

We do not consider that case is suitable for mediation as the Applicant:-

e admitted falsifying the branch’s accounts to conceal losses she was aware existed in the branch

and not seeking POL’s assistance to resolve those issues; and

*® was prosecuted and imprisoned for her offence.

In light of the above, other factors (such as the Applicant (1) failing to provide any evidence that any fault
with Horizon was to blame for/contributed to the losses at her branch; (2) failing to identify any specific
transactional issues she claims to have experienced; and (3) admitting failings in following procedure and
protocol for operating the branch) are secondary and are unlikely to have any material bearing on POL's

decision whether to mediate.

1. This advice has been produced by applying the principles set out in the Advice from Linklaters
dated 20 March 2014.

Advice qualifications

2. _No further legal analysis of the underlying legal principles has been carried out, in particular we
have not considered any other possible legal bases for the Applicant's claims including without
limitation malicious prosecution, defamation, malicious falsehood, breach of confidence, tortious
causes of action or privacy law.

3. We have not analysed the possibility that failures by Post Office in training or supporting the
Applicant, or subsequently investigating losses, may have contributed to the Applicant's ability to
prevent losses in branch.

4, Our advice is based on only the information in the Applicant's Case Questionnaire Response, the
Post Office Investigation Report and Second Sight's Case Review Report. Our advice does not
factor in the possibility of further information being available at a later date that may change our
analysis.

5. We have not considered the Applicant's appetite or capacity to bring proceedings against POL or
any of the "other" factors set out in the settlement mandate.

6. We have not considered any criminal law issues or whether any conviction / sentence may be
unsafe. We have assumed that there are no criminal law risks.

7. We have applied a de minimis threshold to legal risk. Where the legal risk is very small (less than
20%) we have recorded this as 0% in our analysis.
