Update - 3rd Feb 2000

Support rechecked the message store for the 03-Nov-1999, SU 1A was rolled on
ounter 5 and the office was rolled on counter 1. This outlet is a six
ounter office.

Further examination of the event logs for these two counters indicate that
ounter 5 looks suspect (C drive nearly full and big gap of no messages).
‘alls from PO into HSH for period between 30-Oct and 10-Nov indicate a reboot
(counter not specified, but would tie in with counter 5 event log) on
aturday 30-Oct-1999.

jthe evidence in the message store was that messages continued to be written
jto the message store but that all the ‘Payment’ transactions which should
ave been recorded in the rollover trailer messages failed to appear
(although others did, such as the Rem OUT and Transfer OUT totals).

this indicates that the problem was not one of running out of Disk space but
f failing either to retrieve, or write out, transaction totals for one
articular node in the node hierarchy.

lciven that there were known problems with corrupted Persistent Object indexes
lat about this time, it is possible that an update to an EPOSSNodes object
failed to be registered correctly at the outlet, causing the node
cumulation to fail.

tt was decided to prove this out by deleting the ‘Payments’ node in the node
Hierarchy and then running the SU balance, to attempt to identify the root
cause of the problem. Call passed to testing to be scheduled.

Ppdate 18th Feb 2000

the test was carried out on 16th February as follows: delete the Payments
IEPOSSNodes object before

jproducing a SU balance, on a version of the current live system (CI2_2R).
hen trying to print the Payments part of the SU balance, the missing node is
detected by the system and an error tablet with message "A system error has
curred whilst printing. Please ring the helpdesk. Error at 67640." is
jgenerated. So the balance could not be finished.

this type of error trapping error trapping was introduced at the end of last
ear when resolving AI298 issues and we are investigating if the outlet did
not have such error handling when the problem occurred.

certainly, with the current system, a missing Payments node now would not go
jundetected.

he problem is currently back with development for further investigation.

Response from Steve Warwick

ralthough there is nothing more we can do about this incident and have
jexhausted all lines of investigation with the evidence available, we had a
further occurrence of a very similar nature at another office in CAP 48.

this has been documented in PinICL 39313 and is under investigation at the
omen".

IT propose this problem is dicussed at the XDMF on Monday.

fthe similar occurrence is currently an incident and I am investigating if the
imilarities are such that we can add this into this problem.

Discussed this issue at XDMF and it is thought that a similar incident has
curred at FAD 025511 Yate Sodbury to the value of £52,814.29p, the problem
luill now remain open and be appended with this information for investigation.
[23/03/00

further occurrence has arisen at FAD 158410 Appleby in Westmorland value
e9, 368. 40p.
chased call with development and spoke to Martin McConnell. Martin has made
jextensive investigations on the issue and using the message stores from the
utlet, has been unable to recreate the fault. Martin is will recommend that
la diagnositic patch is developed and issued into the estate to trap any
future occurrances.
lfscalated the issue to Chris Wannell (development) who will discuss options
with Martin and Steve Warwick,
30/03/00

hris Wannell reported back that a diagnosic fix was being prepared and was
© be submitted to the next Release Management Forum to authorised release
into the live estate. Development have also identified the following
jactivities that are in the area of stock unit integration and are therefore
being tracked as being relevent to this problem.

3/04/00
lan incident has identified a stock unit that attempts to commit discrepancies
jto the messagestore via EPOSSCore and fails. The reason this fails is because
ff unit price checks on the discrepancy. A fix has been developed and is
currently in testing.
futher checking of progress of the diagnositic fix for installation onto the
}dataserver shows it has been developed but not yet released for testing.

Date: 04-Jul-2000 10:40:00 User:Paul Curley
oot cause of stock unit integration problem,
jpata trees have been failing to build fully, and the system has not been
Jdetecting this. Consequently, discrepancies in the balancing have been
curring. In the case of Dungannon a whole Payments node was missing. There
ave been a number of calls relating to this kind of issue.

fix has been put in at C14 which will prevent this happening.
the root cause identified under PC43811 is as follows:-
tDataserver trees have failed to build. This has now been fixed in CI4 and in
conjuction with CP2587 (where the data tree rebuild is minimised to 2
jattempts instead of 4) should return an abort right back up to the user to
retry the balancing process. Instances where this can potentially occur is
for example if the Riposte service has stopped/failed/unable to complete an
TO request issued etc".
