working with HSH/HSD 4, my view as to whether adequate support was

provided to subpostmasters 5, whether | was aware of any bugs errors or

defects with the system and 6, anything else | think the Chair should be aware

. My professional background is that of an Operations Customer Service
Director, Prior to Fujitsu | worked for American Express for 9 years. My only
Role at ICL/Fujitsu was that of General Manager Call Centre /Help Desk
Services from March 1998 to February 2001. The role was overseeing the
European Help Desk Operation which was over 1000 people in 3 countries and
c 20 Separate Help Desks serving consumer and business customers

_ | do not recall having any training or instruction specific to the Horizon Project
or the HSH . In my position that would be the norm for all the helpdesks under
my remit.

. My working day would consist of meetings to discuss/review activities such as:
Help Desk Performance, Sales activity, Strategy setting, Planning, Profitability
Management, HR Issues.

. As the period in question is some 22 years ago | have only a vague recollection
of the Horizon/Pathway project. | didn’t retain any documents relating to HSH
or indeed any other helpdesks under my control.

. My recollection is that the HSH helpdesk was only a small part of my overall
responsibility. | would likely only have been directly involved in the day-to-day
operation of the helpdesk if there had been a significant problem and | do not
recall there being any during my tenure.

. The Help Desk would have had a manager with a group of team

Leaders/supervisors reporting to them. That Manager would have reported to

12. There isn’t anything else that | believe the Chair should be aware of. I’m sorry

that due to the considerable passage of time | cannot be more helpful to the

inquiry.
