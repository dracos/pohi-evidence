Tom/Gareth

We have 2 cases running at the moment where expert witness input is required -
that's Gareth.                                .

I have created an e-mail for each case with the individual requirements listed
and relevant documents attached.

We need to .sit down together to discuss as soon as possible.                       Do you have any
time tomorrow, please?

I will also forward the issues relating to Porters Avenue, which is the other
case in question.

Sorry to trouble you again but T had a further request from our barrister late on
Friday. He would like Gareth to respond in -his witness statement to the points
raised in the Eleanor Nixon statement attached below.

 In addition our barrister would like to speak to Gareth directly and would be
.grateful if in the first instance whether Gareth could either send him his
 contact details or give him a call on his mobile. Our barrister_    called
 Warwick Tatford and his e-mail address is warwicktatford    GRO     ;and mobile
 number is 1_._-.-.-._-GRO

When Gareth completes his statement about Callender Square could he also mention
whether there are any known problems with the Horizon system that Fujitsu are
aware of. If none could this be clarified in the statement.

  -The barrister dealing with this case has requested this additional information.

    My barrister telephoned me yesterday evening and requested that I found out any
    information that Fujitsu may hold in relation to an office called Callender
    Square in Falkirk. Apparently, Anne Chambers a Systems. Specialist employed by
    Fujitsu was, cross examined and it is said that she had full knowledge of an error
    in the Horizon system at this Post Office.
    If Anne is still     employee of fujitsu could you please give me her direct
                                    an




    number so that I can contact her, ,or, alternatively, if there is any report or
    documentation as to What the error was can this be forwarded to me asap.




    Gareth's draft witness statement in response to the accountant's report

    Gareth - West Byfleet


    Penny

    Our defence barrister has asked for all of Gareth's replies in relation to the
    Defences 2nd Interim Report (see attachment below) to be produced as a witness
    statement. I would suggest that the question from the defence is reproduced and
    then Gareth's replies are recorded immediately after for clarity purposes.

    A pre •court hearing has been set for the 1st February and ideally if possible it
    would be helpful if the statement could be received by Friday of this week.
    Could you let Inc know if this is going to be possible.
