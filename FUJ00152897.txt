Tom/Gareth

We have 2 cases running at the moment where expert witness input is required -
that’s Gareth.

I have created an e-mail for each case with the individual requirements listed
and relevant documents attached.

We need to sit down together to discuss as soon’as possible. Do you have any
time tomorrow, please?

I will also forward the issues relating to Porters Avenue, which is the other
case in question.

Sorry to trouble you again but I had a further request from our barrister late on
Friday. He would like Gareth to respond in -his witness statement to the points
raised in the Eleanor Nixon statement attached below.

In addition our barrister would like to speak to Gareth directly and would be
grateful if in the first instance whether Gareth could either send him his
contact details or give him a call on his mobile. Our barrister iscalled
Warwick Tatford and his e-mail address is warwicktatford! GRO }and mobile
number is

When Gareth completes his statement about Callender Square could he also mention
whether there are any known problems with the Horizon system that Fujitsu are
aware of. If none could this be clarified in the statement.

The barrister dealing with this case has requested this additional information.

My barrister telephoned me yesterday evening and requested that I found out any
information that Fujitsu may hold in relation to an office called Callender
Square in Falkirk. Apparently, Anne Chambers a Systems. Specialist employed by
Fujitsu was cross examined and it is said that she had. full knowledge of an error
in the Horizon system at this Post Office. :

If Anne is still an employee of fujitsu could you please give me her direct
number so that I can contact her, or, alternatively, if there is any report or
documentation as to what the error was can this be forwarded to me asap.

Gareth’s draft witness.statement in response to the accountant’s report

Gareth - West Byfleet

Penny '

Our defence barrister has asked for all of Gareth's replies in relation to the
Defences 2nd Interim Report (see attachment below) to be produced as a witness
statement. I would suggest that the question from the defence is reproduced and
then Gareth's replies are recorded immediately after for clarity purposes.

A pre court hearing has been set for the 1st February and ideally if possible it
would be helpful if the statement could be received by Friday of this week.
Could you let tite know if this is going to be possible.
