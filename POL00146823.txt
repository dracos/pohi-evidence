Hi. Am on blackberry. No doc to hand today but front page exec summ of paper I did for Dave Smiths ExCo still holds
good and I can send that next week.

Alternatively through our links with Angela and Gayle and Simon we've had several similar questions. Are any of them in
the roon (obviously Andy H instead of simon now)

Thanks Rod

Just had a meeting on sparrow. We need a paper to explain the accounting around Horizon at a high level. One of the
points that I want to make is that horizon has few errors with clients — does such a paper exist? If not could one be
produced next week? High level one.
