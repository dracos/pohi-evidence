During thé recent Opposition Day debate on the Post Office Card Account, the
Government agreed to a proposal from Lindsay Hoyle for a task force of MPs to work
with the Government to identify new services to help secure the long term viability of
the post office network.

Given the Select Committee’s longstanding interest in, and depth of knowledge of,
the post office network, Pat McFadden and I believe that the Committee would be
particularly well placed to take on this task force role under your Chairmanship.

The Post Office has the obvious strengths of a trusted brand and a large nationwide
network. Following the decision to award the new POCA contract to the Post Office, I
think the time is right to look at what other potential there may be in further
Government (including local authority) work for the Post Office.

As you are also aware the Post Office has also been developing its financial services
offering, in partnership with the Bank of Ireland. I know the Post Office is keen to do
more on this front, though obviously this must be commercially viable for the Post
Office.

I very much hope that you and your Committee will agree to take on the task force
role. It would be helpful if the work could be completed by early next summer at the
latest.
