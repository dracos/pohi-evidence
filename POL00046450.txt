SUMMARY OF INVESTIGATION

6. On Wednesday the 20" August 2008, a criminal investigation was started in England and Wales into
offences of theft and false accounting. In connection with the investigation, I have been informed by Mike
Wilcox, the officer in charge of the criminal investigation, and believe that: -

a) The defendant was an assistant working at Ibstock Sub Post Office, 118-120 High Street,
Ibstock, LE67 6LJ. The incumbent Subpostmaster was the defendant's Husband, Ernest Michael
Rudkin who had been in post since the 26" October 2000,

b) An audit of the office accounts on the 20" August 2008 revealed a shortage in the office
accounts of £43,856.89. As a result of the audit shortage, Mr Rudkin was precautionary
suspended from his position as Subpostmaster,

©) Dn the 20" August 2008, Post Office Investigators interviewed the defendant under caution.

d) During that interview the defendant stated that the office had been experiencing losses in the
Post Office accounts from approximately January 2006 and that she had been inflating the cash

‘on hand figure in the accounts to cover the shortages.

e) She further stated during interview that she had taken cash from the Post Office to cover
payment of general bills, which had been paid it into a joint bank account held with her husband.
The defendant stated that she alone was responsible and that no one else had any knowledge
of the theft.

) Mike Wilcox is still carrying out further investigations.

7. I believe that there is reasonable cause to believe that the defendant has benefited from her particular
criminal conduct to at least £43,856.89.

REALISABLE PROPERTY

8. I have made preliminary enquires into the financial affairs of the defendant and it is to my knowledge
that:-

a) The defendant is a 53 year-old female residing at? GRO 1She lives
there with her husband Ernest Michael Rudkin and two sons. The Post Office is attached to the private

residence.

b) The registered title number of the! roperty if GRO and isin the joint names

of the defendant and her husband, The property was purchased for £150,000,00 in January 2001. The

value of the property is now believed te be in the region of £321,119 (Nationwide House Price
calculator) and £490,000,00 (estimate by defendant) with an outstanding mortgage in the region of
£250,000.00.

c) Enquiries have revealed that the defendant has access to the following bank account:

I. Uoyds TSB joint account with her husband, account number! GRO
showed a negative balance of £252.08 as of the 1* August 2008.

d) Intelligence shows that the defendant has known credit card debts and a personal loan, which currently
total just over £27,000.00.

©) Intelligence shows that the defendant husband (Ernest Michael Rudkin) has known credit card debts
which currently total just over £10,000.00.

EXTENT OF BENEFIT

9. I believe that the defendant has a criminal lifestyle through having committed a criminal lifestyle

offence. This is because:

I believe that the defendant has committed an offence(s) over a period of at least six months and has
benefited fram this offence in total of not fess than £5,000.

10. The enquiry is at an early stage and the extent of benefit is not yet known.

11. ft is, therefore, my opinion that this is a case in which the court may apply the assumptions under
section 10 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 when assessing the extent of the benefit from criminal

conduct.

12. In so far as I am aware, no civil proceedings have been commenced on behaif of any person that might be

said to have sustained foss arising out of the commission of the alleged offence(s).

13. I believe that if a restraint order is not made there is a real risk that these assets will be dissipated. This
is because of the serious nature of the alleged offences and the amount of public money involved. Emest

equity in the property known as It has been established that
