Soumyajit,

I can confirm that POL have responded saying we can make the BAL change at a “future maintenance release”.
Therefore we should be including this fix in 2.10 (assuming RMF targets the Peak!)

Thanks Gareth,

I agree we should defer the BAL change if possible but given the focus we should agree this with Phil Norton of
POL and Gareth is doing this.

Soumyajit, don’t go beyond thinking about how we could do this please.
Steve, please can you confirm if you need to deliver again for R2.

Many Thanks,

Graham,

Are you happy with my suggestion that the BAL fix is left until 2.10 and we just do the BRDB bit before then?
If so that makes a significant difference to what Soumyajit needs to plan.

NB Peaks have now been raised:

Defects 13922(PC0200577) & 13923(PC0200578) raised as ‘A’ priority.

The 2" is a clone of the 1*t and has been requested to be sent FAO the BRDB team, and the 2" FAO the
BAL team.

So I'm expecting to see PC0200578 coming through to GDC shortly (currently with QFP).

Looks like this will get escalated for quick delivery.

It is now being deemed a peak.

Below is the BDB impact and I believe 2 days BAL work was also required.

Gareth / Pete, we need 2 peaks raised for this please (BDB and BAL) can I ask you to communicate to
Debbie / Sheila what info needs to be in the peak as we should not raise the peaks.

Martin / Soumyajit, can we work out our options for delivery of the BAL change please.

We are still discussing this at a management level as fitting in the testing of this will be an extreme

challenge.

Graham,

Dist list reduced.

Response consolidated from Pete J and Gareth.

The LST test would take a number of days:

Day 1: Implement and run one day with shared stock units trading/not-trading and also individual stock
units trading/not-trading. Each having various combinations of declarations/non-declarations.

Day 2: next day, vary the transactions and declaration combinations

Day 3: Similar scenarios to finally prove the solution

A number of stock-unit combinations, transaction combinations and declaration combinations. This would
require more analysis.

It would be possible to cover the different scenarios at different branches on the same day (if enough
branches are available) and thus reduce the number of elapsed days. All the decision taken should be
per Stock Unit or per Branch so setting up different branches with different scenarios on a single day
should be possible.

If any further detail is needed would suggest the tester discusses with Pete and or Gareth. Note Pete is
on leave next week.

WRT implementation time, it should be fairly quick to install the changes.

Graham Allen

From a development point of view we can do this but finding a slot to get
beyond this will be tricky before R3 hence the proposal.

The development effort for this is as follows:

Planning & Development (1 day

1 new date column to be added to BRDB_BRANCH_STOCK_UNITS (name TBA?) - will
*always* contain 00:00:00 for the time part.

Several changes required to aggregation process 'OVERNIGHT_CASH_ON_HAND',
namely:

* Remove current row-by-row check for ONCH

* Add update of BRDB_BRANCH_STOCK_UNITS.last_good_onch_date for input
FAD_HASH if declaration made today

* Add update of BRDB_BRANCH_STOCK_UNITS.last_good_onch_date where
last_good_onch_date >= yesterday AND no txns exist in
BRDB_RX_REP_SESSION_DATA since 17:55 yesterday or last decl (whatever's
later)

* Rework update on ONCH flag in BRDB_CASH_HEADER

* Rework insert of BRDB_CASH_DETAILS

Dev Testing (1.5 days)

* Design test scenarios, write test scripts, changes to above SQL due to
performance tweaking - 1 day

* Test using data from live for FAD_HASH 10 (already loaded) - 1/2 day
Packaging & delivery (1/2 day

* Package up changes above into BRDB patch + test execution & regression
Total 3 days

The proposed changes include performance enhancements (the strategy reduces

the database reads significantly). This will reduce the load later in
rollout if we get it in early and so there is added benefit of doing it now.

Subject: Cash Declaration

Geoff,
Can you look at the below as a matter of urgency please and provide some
input for a discussion at the board on Thursday. This looks like a
potential High Acceptance Incident, in that the impacts are quite huge in
terms of cash holdings, and supply of cash to branches to enable them to
operate. This is not business equivalent and is different to how Horizon
works now, given Gareth's misunderstanding comment. We need something
urgently done on this to stop this becoming a big issue within the
business.

Give me a call if you need to discuss.

Subject: Fw: Cash Declaration

Further to our telephone conversation.

To summarise, on Horizon a Cash Dec has to be made for every SU that has
done a txn that day, on a daily basis. As long as at least one cash dec is
performed at some time in that day for each SU, the branch is OK for
achieving their cash dec completion requirement.

However, what seems to have been implemented on HNGx is that the branch
must make their cash dec in each SU as the last txn in the day within that
SU, e.g. once they've declared cash they can't do any other txns or it will
FUJ00097001
FUJ00097001

invalidate the declaration from a cash dec completion requirement
perspective.

This results in the feed to SAP ADS having NO cash information (other than
the system generated cash figure)

The operational implications of this are significant - both to the Network
and the Cash Inventory Team.

The Inventory team will not have accurate data on which to base their
replenishment - as SAP ADS will default to the system derived figure in the
absence of a valid ONCH declaration. This figure includes all coin and

more importantly, ATM cash - making an automated replenishment inaccurate
and the potential requirement for emergency cash deliveries considerably
higher.

The team also currently monitor conformance and chase those offices that
fail to declare their cash - this would have to be "suspended" until a fix
is applied as there will be no means of identifying nonconformance in the
Network

From a Network perspective the requirement to have the cash declaration as
the last transaction of the day is currently unworkable. In the Crown
Network it would require union negotiations to re-align Colleagues hours,
which in turn would impact the staffing of the branch etc....

There is also the impact on Cash Management by the operational teams within
the Network - again, as a business we would lose the control we currently
have and from an Audit perspective POL would lose any leverage we currently
have regards "false" declarations - opening the business up to a
potentially increased level of fraud.

For all these reasons this defect needs to be fixed as a matter urgency
and, contrary to the proposal by Fujitsu, without the raising of a CR. The
Use Case “obtain daily cash on hand statements for SAP ADS" was a retained
functionality UC, and therefore HNG should operate in the same way as
Horizon. It doesn't and therefore this is a defect - not a Change.

The paper from Gareth at the foot of this mail gives more detail of the
issue and the proposed fix.

Happy to discuss

I Subject: RE: FW: Cash Declaration

Neil,

Thanks for your response.

The attached paper (basically an updated version of what I sent you before
describes what I believe we can do to change the way in which the ONCH
calculations currently operate. Please note that there are a couple of
places (highlighted in green) where confirmation is required as to the
acceptability to Post Office Ltd of some of the details of the proposed
design. In particular the proposed design will result in the "whinge" at
Log On being based on exactly the same rules as those used for generating
the incomplete ONCH flag to SAP ADS (which is not currently the case nor is
it in the Horizon implementation).

Happy to provide more detail or discuss options around what is proposed.
I've discussed this within Fujitsu and the view is that what we have
currently implemented matched the agreed design even though the assumptions
behind that were based on a misunderstanding of the Horizon behaviour, and
so any change is subject to a CR form Post Office Ltd. If a CR is received
quickly it should be possible to schedule it for HNG-X Release 3. I would
suggest that an updated version of the design note is used as a basis for
the CR (or is attached to it).

Regards

Gareth

Thanks for your paper on the Cash Declarations issue.

POL network have been debating the options for this and have reached a
conclusion that the checks currently in place on Horizon should be adopted
for HNGx. In the 3rd paragraph of your Introduction, you advised that you
would need to separately consider the imapct of making these changes to
relax the rules for HNGx and the relevant timescales for this. If you could
advise of this in due course, that would be appreciated.

Can I also ask what is the implications of the last paragraph in section 3,

namely:
It should be noted that a check is carried out as part of the Log On
process that there was a valid Cash Declaration "yesterday". The rules for

this are different and are also different between Horizon and HNG-X.
Ideally, we would like this relaxed rule to be consistent, so that branches
are not forced to declare their cash after closing on a Saturday (and any
other day before the branch is closed for a day(s)), when they don't have
to on any other day.

Finally, I can confirm that POL do NOT require the bug in Horizon (as
described in section 4) to be replicated on HNGx.

Regards,

Neil
