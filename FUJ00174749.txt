Hi, Duncan has just spoken with Paula. A very good conversation - headlines are;

- Paula is very appreciative of our support (and recognises how much we have been supporting them)

- POA have made a choice not to engage publically in response to the story as it hasn’t taken off that much

- Paula described herself as being “mildly troubled” by it - which is a change from this being a top priority a week
ago

- POA are now looking at what they need to do in response to the report e.g increase Post Master training - this is
work in progress for them

-  Aquestion is going to be asked in Parliament about the report. Jo Swinson has chosen to answer it personally
rather than have a written answer (because she believes she can kill it more easily by being there in person).
Lesley has been over at Parliament this morning briefing Jo (not sure if Paula was also there)

So all good from a Fujitsu perspective.
