Lesley, Alwen

Brief overview of the problem encountered in 2010 below.

The reassuring point, for those looking for comfort, is that in this case Horizon’s monitoring systems
automatically picked up the anomaly.

Subject: Balancing Issues in 2010

Simon,

Here is a quick briefing on the Balancing issue we had in 2010 in preparation for tomorrow’s meeting with Lesley.

When a clerk balances a stock unit the rollover screen is eventually displayed, and the clerk then presses the
Preview or Print button to produce the Trial Balance Report. The counter then returns to the rollover screen.

Having checked the report, the clerk then presses the Rollover button, and in normal circumstances is given the
choice of rolling to a new Balance Period (BP) or a new Trading Period (TP).

If the clerk chooses to roll to a new TP, and net discrepancies are present, then the system asks whether the clerk
wishes to transfer the net discrepancy to local suspense, or else cancel the rollover (MSG31316).

If the clerk presses Cancel on MSG31316, and on the rollover screen then presses Rollover again, then the Final

Balance report will have a Receipt/Payments mismatch (Total Receipts not equal to Total Payments) which will
ultimately lead to a Non-zero Trading Position on the Branch Trading Statement.

If the clerk does not check the Final Balance report, he/she may not be aware that the report has a
Receipts/Payments mismatch. For a Trial Balance report the counter does warn the clerk if a Receipt/Payments
mismatch occurs, for a Final Balance report it does not. This is as stated in use case BAC-11 Balance Stock Unit.
The counter however does always raise error 0902 in the log file and NT event log.

The key message is the last statement, namely that “The counter however does always raise error 0902 in the log
file and NT event log”. What this means is that an unexpected alert is raised that should be picked up by our
Alert monitoring systems that will ensure that the problem is investigated by our support teams. In other words,
the system is designed to spot a problem like this as it is something that should never happen (other than as a
result of bugs) and if it does happen, then an alert is raised so it can be investigated.

One of the actions that we are taking as a result of the Local Suspense problem we found this year is to put in
some further checks for “situations that should never happen” that related to that problem and to raise an alert
if they do.

I attach a document I produced for Post Office Ltd in May 2011 where I put together a storyboard showing the
exact sequence of events for one of the affected branches.

The problem affected around 60 Branches. I understand that FSC communicated with all the affected branches
and compensated them where appropriate.

Regards

Gareth
