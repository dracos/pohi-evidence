3.2 Dave Miller said that he had made a request 10 Mike Coombes for greater visibility
of the product, Horizon has asked for sight of the design documentation. ICL
Pathway are reluctant to allow this because they maintain that their development
structures and systems are commercially sensitive and need to be kept secure.
Dave Miller has made it clear that he is prepared to accept any security measures
ICL Pathway deem fit to protect their intellectual property, but Horizon must be
better apprised of EPOSS development.

. Detailed Testing Requirements

3.4 There are still a number of unresolved differences between BA and Pathway over
the Detailed Testing Requirements. Dave Miller explained that there was a need
for a senior level meeting to determine exactly what the testing requirements are
going to he. Peter Crahan said that the issyes should be tabled at the Formal
Management Review Meeting on 18/6/98, The Chair sought and received
assurance that if this was not the case, escalation routes were in place and that
there was the facility to resolve this issue. ’

was still much work to do to obtain clarity of understanding which was acceptable
to all parties. Acceptance had been an on-going process for some time in terms of

on which to base it. The Board made it clear that the issue of what constituted
acceptance needed resolving quickly and it should not be left to the end of the
process, A further update on this issue will be provided in the next Horizon
Director's Report to the Board. .
