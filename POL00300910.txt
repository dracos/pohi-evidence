Risk/Issue

Programme Key Risks
Update Budget Next ]

There is a risk that the expectation gap between
Post Office's expectation of the total value of the
settlements and the claimants is not accurate on
either side

There is no agreed articulation of success for the
programme

Second Sight need to be actively managed to
mitigate any potential reputational damage to Post
Office. There may be disagreements between key
governance bodies on what Second Sight's role is
going forward

There is a risk that a) 24 POL investigators will not
be sufficient to work through the number and
complexity of cases submitted and b) they will not
have the required capability to write the reports to
the standard required

Risk that PO does not have a strategy for handling
a major legal failure linked to the scheme

1. Programme Board to regularly review expected
claims and the financial contingencies

2. Consideration being given to communications in this
area

3. Bond Dickinson to keep the expected liability under
regular review.

Workshop scheduled 16/12 to draft initial success
criteria.

To be reviewed and agreed at next Steering Group (by
31/01)

Meeting scheduled 18/12 to agree the strategy and
plan for managing Second Sight.

1. Angela overseeing investigators recruitment.
2. Enhanced Quality Assurance in place.
3. Initial training day on 17 December.

Develop contingency plans by the end of January.
