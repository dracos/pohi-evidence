EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF IMPACT ASSESSMENTS:
This CCN is to introduce ISBN (Integrated Satellite Business Network) communications access
method, known generally as VSAT, as the preferred method of connection when an ISDN service
cannot be installed.

OVERALL IMPACT ASSESSMENT: __ HIGH--MEDIUM~+ LOW,

REASON FOR CHANGE:

Tn certain locations an ISDN service is not available. At the date of this CCN it is anticipated that up to
350 outlets will require an alternative form of communications access. Hitherto the intention has been
to use Frame Relay connection for such outlets. However, some of these non-ISDN outlets may also
not be capable of Frame Relay connection, The VSAT method is introduced to provide an alternative
approach to handle non-ISDN cases, providing a comparable service with respect to reliability,
resilience, security and performance.

DETAILS OF CHANGE:

This CCN introduces the VSAT communications access method to the Codified Agreement. This is
achieved by introducing a summary change to para. 3.2.1 of Schedule GO1 and detailed changes to
Schedule A16, Equivalent changes are necessary in G01, para 5.3.5.1, G06, para 4.5 and minor
changes are required to various CCDs (SFS, Counter Hardware Design, SADD, Counter Installation
and Survey Requirements), for which proposed revisions are attached.

PROPOSED REVISION TO WORDING OF CODIFIED AGREEMENT:
Schedule G01, para 3.2.1, insert after first sentence:
“This interworking shall use one of the following communications access methods:
Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN)
Integrated Satellite Business Network (ISBN), generally referred to as VSAT (Very Small Aperture
Terminal)
Frame Relay”
Ditto para 5.3.5.1
Schedule G06, Section 4.5, replace:
“BT ISDN or Frame Relay lines installation may be carried out separately and with prior notification to
Regional Liaison Manager and/or Outlet Manager (approval not required for ISDN or Frame Relay
installation provided that it is carried out during the normal working hours of the relevant outlet).
With:
ISDN, VSAT or Frame Relay lines installation may be carried out separately and with prior notification
to Regional Liaison Manager and/or Outlet Manager (approval not required for ISDN, VSAT or Frame
Relay installation provided that it is carried out during the normal working hours of the relevant outlet).

Deliverables: Counter configurations using VSAT require the use of an Ethernet connection,
with the gateway PC connecting via a separate Ethernet card to a Personal Earth Station
(PES), which comprises an Outdoor Unit (ODU) 0.98 metre antenna and a Digital Indoor Unit
(DIU) baseband signal converter. Software modifications to address the revised hardware are
as per Frame Relay solution.

CCN No: 633 Page:

FUJ00000561
FUJ00000561
Personnel: The installation operates without outlet staff intervention.

Existing Timetable: Installations of satellite communications will be undertaken from October
2000 to February 2001.

Implementation Plans: Minor. Planning permission to erect the antenna is not normally
required. Surveys and site preparation will take account of accommodating the PES and
connection to the gateway PC.

Security: The method uses VSAT standard secure transmission and encrypted VPN tunnels.

Risk: Low. This is a standard product line service. The software development is the same as
that already completed for the Frame Relay access method.

System Support: Failure of the PES or associated outlet equipment requires a site visit. A
switch from primary to backup satellite usage, should one occur, may require a site visit,
depending on the method used to access the backup satellite (see below).

System Management: Failure of the ground station is handled by switchover to a backup.
Failure of the transponder is handled by using spare routes. Failure of the whole satellite is
handled by switchover to a backup satellite initiated by the service provider. Reconnection of
outlets to the backup satellite will be provided by the service provider. Two methods of
reconnection will be provided. Either or both of the following alternative methods of
reconnection will be provided. ICL Pathway, its network provider and the VSAT service
provider will select the method in the light of circumstances prevailing at the time of any
failure.

(a) by repositioning a backup satellite to occupy an equivalent position to that of the failed
satellite, within three days starting on the day following failure, or

(b) by re-aligning and re-re-tuning the PES equipment to the backup satellite, at the rate of 100
outlets/day, starting on the day following failure, and with priority given to busiest offices.

Standards: N/A.

Accommodation/Location: N/A

Charging Mechanism:

Where cost estimates are included, these are quoted as a mid-point estimate of the work to be
carried out by ICL Pathway. The eventual charge will be made on an ‘actuals’ Time and
Materials basis using the same man-rates. A 20% contingency has been included in the CCN
to allow for reasonable variation around the mid-point estimate. The estimate is set so that
the ICL eventual charge is as likely to be lower as higher than the estimate excluding
contingency. The contingency is included to provide allowable headroom for invoicing
purposes against a purchase order. Above this level, ICL Pathway would have to apply for
additional approval via a new CCN.

Service Delivery Criteria: N/A

Service Levels: Satellite service availability is estimated at not less than 99.85%. Mean time for
outlet reconnection in the event of a complete satellite failure depends upon the final number
of VSAT connections but is anticipated to be less than four days regardless of method.

POCL Responsibilities: N/A

Contractual Issues: N/A.

Other: This CCN replaces that already submitted CCN633a.

CCB DECISION (MTG NO 109): CCN ISSUESThis CCN was presented for discussion only. J Dicks stated
that the associated CP2517 was to be discussed at PCCB 13/4/00. T Oppenheim/J Flynn confirmed that some
outlets cannot be serviced by Frame Relay and that K Baines had been advised of this. T Oppenheim stated
that there is no contractual obligation to connect non ISDN single counter position offices and his belief that if
offered it, POCL would accept the Satellite option for these offices. J Dicks stated that there were currently
470 single counter position non ISDN offices and J Flynn was actioned to confirm this. T Oppenheim stated
that the CCN should reconfirm satellite offer for single counter position offices. Discussion surrounding the
Business Continuity clement of this change took place and that this should be included as a caveat within the
CCN. T Oppenheim requested that the full service, implementation and technical implications of this change
should be reviewed & a standalone outline plan produced by G Chatten for both satellite & mobile CCNs. T

CHANGE CONTROL:Revised CCN633a received from Dave Hollingsworth 9/6/00 with note as follows:Please
find attached the revised version of CCN 633, now identified as 633a. This takes account of the POCL
comments received on 633 (from Bob Booth) and includes the changes resulting from decisions at the 8th June
review with BT / Energis. The only additional information requirement I can think of is (possibly) for technical
details of the PES to be included in the appropriate implementation document as some stage. Bob McD et al
may need to check through any implications in this area. Since planning application is not normally required
there should be very little change to existing survey requirements documentation.! have lefi formal issue till we
have final confirmation from BT / Energis of the fallback arrangements after any switch to backup satellite since
this is applicable to the stated rate of service restoration in the CCN. This is expected (I understand) at the start
of next weekI am not clear if associated CP 2517 will be revised or a new CP raised (hopefully the former); I
