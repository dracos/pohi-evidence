1 Summary

1.1 Background

The first report of an annual customer care visit programme at ‘live’ post offices
within the North East and South West regions. The care visits consist of a
structured survey about the post-impierentation services provided by ICL Pathway.
These visits are carried out by management staff within ICL Pathway.

The Offices visited in 1997 were using Release 1b (Order Book Control Service).

1.2 Methodology

The 1997 visits were part of the initial pilot. 18 post offices were visited during

the latter part of 1997, split equally between the two regions. Subpostmasters were
asked to answer questions about the services ICL Pathway provides and also given
the opportunity to express their views, concerns and comments about these services.

1.3 Conclusions

* Overall the Subpostmasters were 90% happy with the services provided.

The Subpostmasters in the North East were generally more satisifed than those in
the South West.

The most positive areas were the services provided by the Horizon System Engineers,
the Horizon System Helpdesk and ongoing communication.

The least positive area was Training and User Guides. There were concerns that the
training was not always local enough, the attendees were out of pocket and the User
Guides were of little use at the moment as the system is so simple to use.

Concerns were expressed about the local Benefit Agency offices, particularly in the
North East, where they seemed to disregard the Stop Notice information held on the
Horizon System and give out contradicatory information to customers and
Subpostmasters.

The placement of equipment in the post offices was also of concern. In one case
POCL had visited to report on the situation, but the Subpostmaster had not received
any further communication.

The users were happy to be involved in the live trail and understood the need for

automation, but were frustrated at having so little functionality and very much looking
forward to being able to do more through the Horizon System.

*

1.4 Recommendations

The differences between the North East and South West levels of satisfaction should be
investigated to see if anything done differently in the North East could be mirrored in
future in the South West.

Action should be taken to improve communication or understanding within local Benefit
Agency Offices.

Any outstanding issues regarding the placing of equipment should be followed up to a
satisfactory conclusion.

Some individual actions are being followed through by ICL Pathway as a result of the visits

2 Introduction

The 1997 care visits were carried out using a small cross section of post offices within the
North East and South West regions. 18 offices were visited (evenly split between the
regions) as a pilot for the ongoing commitment of visiting a larger cross section of post
offices from 1998 onwards.

This pilot was specifically targetted at users of the OBCS release of Horizon software (Order
Book Control Service).

Only management level ICL. Pathway staff carry out the visits to ensure the highest level
of custorner care service is maintained. Each nominated ICL Pathway manager is given a
detailed briefing of the programme and detailed procedures are documented for them to
follow.

All information is gathered in confidence, but each Subpostmaster is asked if he or she will
allow ICL Pathway to possibly contact them again in connection with the care visit, or to
follow up any necessary actions as a result of the visit.

After full rofl out of the Horizon project, it is planned that 500 post offices will be visited

during the course of each year. It is intended that offices are chosen randomly each
year. During 1998 ICL Pathway will plan to visit 100 post offices.

This area holds the highest fevel of satisfaction. A few Subpostmasters had not had

any engineer visits at the point of the interview and so were unable to comment,

however, those that had were always impressed with the engineer's help and professional
attitude. The only negative response was one post office who did not bother to complete the
SVR feedback cards.

One of the higher levels of dissatisfaction. The problems were based around a slight
degradation in time taken to serve customers (especially when the software was new to users)
and the layout of the equipment in the office (ICL. Pathway maintain a snagging list for actioning
any agreed outstanding work at offices). Most were happy with how easy the system was to

Dissatisfaction was with users frustrated that the system has limited use, some
nervousness about using computers and that it takes longer to serve customers than
the manual system does at present. Some interest has been expressed by customers,
and generally users and customers see the system as a positive step.

7 Conclusions

The Subpostmasters were given the opportunity to provide additional comments against each
question asked in the questionnaire, and to provide any general comments, suggestions,
concems or good news stories.

In general the views were very positive, but because of the limited functionality of the
software at this stage it was felt there was not much to comment on.

The Horizon System Helpdesk staff and Horizon System Engineers were highly
regarded as professional, polite and helpful at ail times. Only one concern was how
long it took to validate the Subpostmaster when calling the desk. This put off some
users from calling and encouraged their own ‘network’ of communication for advice and
guidance,

A more general concern was the communication between the focal Benefits Agency
{particularly in the North East area), the users and the general public. Often the BA
has given out information which contradicted that of the Horizon System (namely
whether a book should be impounded or if a payment should be made). The
Subpostmasters were concerned that the BA was causing the public to question
the Subpostmasters professionalism or ability.

There were a few mix ups over training events. Some were arranged at very short
notice or some venues were changed at short notice, and some Subpostmasters felt the
events were not local enough. Most were concerned that attending the events put them
out of pocket, and would have liked to have received remuneration.

The Manuals provided at the training events (I.e. Horizon Training Workbook and the
Quick Reference Guide) were well received as easy to follow and thorough, although
were rarely needed with the current level of functionality available.

All users found the system easy to use and ‘IT phobics’ were cured after attending
the training. There was frustration that the system had a limited use, particularly
when the users first start using the system. They found the time it took to serve a
customer was longer than using the manual system, but for a perceived minimum
benefit.

The placement of equipment in offices was of some concern. Many had little space
which meant that printers and keyboards were not easily accessible. Replacement
of equipment during the upgrade to Release ic should improve the situation.

Subpostmasters were happy with the level of ongoing communication about the
Horizon project. Some felt that there was not enough information provided by POCL.

The encashment total is too small and can cause the Subpostmasters to mis-read it.

it is apparent from the questionnaire results that the North East region is more positive
than the South West. This was also found in an earlier questionnaire about the Release 1b
implementation carried out by POCL Research Services.

Overall the Subpostmasters were 90% happy with services provided during 1b live trial.
Generally the concerns raised were by single offices with the exception of Benefits Agency
communication, the placement of equipment and the increased time taken to serve
customers.

All understood the need for the Horizon project, were happy to be involved, and were keen
to receive more functionality.

8 Recommendations and Further Work

Some individual actions are being followed through which are specific to particular post
offices. These are noted on a spreadsheet and the responsibility for pursuing the actions
through to a satisfactory conclusion will be on the ICL Pathway Customer Satisfaction
Manager.

General recommendations are that we pursue and investigate further the issues below

*

Why, again, the North East Region are more positive than the South West.
Should investigate whether any services are provided in a different way in either
region

Ongoing efforts to improve Benefits Agency's understanding of Horizon project and
for the communication within the organisation to be affective. Any instances of problems.
received from Subpostmasters will be passed to PDA for information.

Discuss possibility of POCL providing some remuneration for Subpostmasters attending
training events in future.

Ensure maximum notice possible given for training events in future and avoid changing
venues whenever possible.

Any offices which require further attention after the 1c upgrade will be reviewed and
possibly placed on a 'Snagging List' of outstanding items to be rectified.

Discussions on the rules for the positioning of equipment in future installations should
take place.

Investigate the possibility of enlarging the ‘encashment total’ figures.

Appendices
1 Questionnaire

The following is a copy of the questionnaire used when interviewing the Subpostmasters. The
first page is an introductory script which can be used to provide further information about the nature
of the care visit.

HORIZON SYSTEM

CARE VISIT QUESTIONNAIRE AND REPORT

INTRODUCTION SCRIPT

On arrival ensure you show your Pass. Give your name and explain you work for the
Customer Service department of ICL Pathway, explaining what our department does.

‘The Customer Service department is responsible for the ongoing support of the Horizon system
itself, after installation. These responsibilities cover all aspects of support and services relating to
the Horizon system, for example supporting you the user with advice and guidance, and ensuring
that customer satisfaction is monitored and maintained to a satisifactory level.

in summary, this interview will help us monitor how satisfied you are with the system and related
services, and will be key to recognising where improvements may need to be made, plus
recognising particularly positive areas and using those examples to help improve other areas of
service.

Whilst there is no time limit set for the interview, the survey should take no more than 20 minutes,
and how long you would like in addition to the survey is up to you.

After the meeting we will be sending you a letter summarising the details of this interview so that
you can check we have accurately interpreted the interview.’

if asked you can explain the background of why we are doing this survey.
‘This year we expect to talk to approximately 20 users of the Horizon system.

Similar visits will be carried out each year, throughout the year. Most Post Offices will be picked
randomly and therefore whilst you probably won't be approached every year, it is possible you will
be approached again at some time in the future. When the programme is in full operation we
would expect to survey approximately 500 Post Offices each year (full operation is expected to
commence in 1999).

Your individual visit reports will remain confidential between you and ICL Pathway. However, we will

be publishing general results, and following up any individual user problems when relevant, if you
agree to further contact as a result of the visit.

3 Additional Comments by Subpostmasters

The following comments were given when the Subpostmasters were asked the question:
“Do you have any suggestions for improvements to the Horizon System or the service
provided, and can you highlight any particularly positive experiences?”

"Post Office Counters need more business people for commercial reasons."

"The DSS are contradicting what the Horizon system Stop Notice says."

“Is there a £10 payment for the upgrade training? My RNM mentioned it in passing."
"No negatives. Looking forward to more functionality. My only frustration is the limited
use. There is a minor degradation in service because it takes a little more time to
incorporate both Horizon and manual systems."

"Several issues relating to the equipment and layout which are negative.”

"Too much time elapsed between training and the receipt of the system, there could also
be more focus on user hands on experience.”

"Great help in fraud prevention, and also the positive effect of removing the ‘impounding’
decision from the clerk."

"Post Office Counters came and produced a report about the unsatisfactory layout of the
equipment, but we have heard nothing."

"DSS are calling Post Offices to say they shouldn't call books in, contradicting the system
and asking the Postmasters to just cash a docket anyway’.”

“Who is responsible for supplying anti static sprays? We have never received any.”

“The position for the monitors offered by WTL was not very professional.”

“The position of the card swipe slot should be at the front of the keyboard, not at the back.
“Before we were able to switch off screens overnight the heat was too much. Now it's ok.”

“Positive response from customers when the system says to impound a book. Less
room for argument. Encashment total could be bigger.“

"I hope the support from the HFSO is a bit more reliable for the upgrade.“
“The project has gone remarkably smoothly bearing in mind the size of the project.”

"More thought could be put into shelves/brackets for layout of equipment, and more
consultation with Posimaster before equipment installation.”

"Horizon/Pathway staff more friendly and helpful than Post Office staff.”

“Training at Bath Spa had been cancelled 1 week before but { had not been informed and
therefore turned up for training."

“Not pleased with increase in electricity bill.”

“POCL Security person came to visit and said I needed a speech screen. He measured
up and said he couldn't see a solution, but that he would take it away and make more
suggestions. He said the plastic stand provided was obsolete and a new one that doesn't
fit anyway has taken its place.”

“Report printer is not in a usable place at the moment. it will need to be moved when it is
required.”

Training was too tong and too little practical hands on experience. Also it was not close
enough to the start of operations, at least 1 month before we needed to use the system.

"We get good, fast and effective support.”
"When the full scope of the system is available then life will be very much easier for the P
staff. The ievel of service and services offered will increase. Looking forward to the full

system.”

“When encashment total displayed on screen it could be larger.“
