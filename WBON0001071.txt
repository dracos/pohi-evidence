Tony,

Owain

Attached is the GPOC which were provided yesterday (there is also a comparison the revised draft GPOC).

Itis a fairly chunky document and we are still reviewing it but thought it would be helpful to have a call next week to
discuss a high level strategy for how we wish to respond. I have asked your clerk to find a suitable time.

Our current thinking points on the defence are:

Is it forensic / what level of detail do we go into?

Do we refuse to plead to some points?

Do we keep to a strict pleading only?

Are we just reactive to the matters pleaded or assert a positive position?

Do we assert a counterclaim (this brings with it the need to state a positive case.

The best approach may be for Owain to put together a very rough first draft so as we can get a feel for the approach

and tl

Kind
Amy

the areas which require further investigation and refine from there — of course welcome to thoughts.
