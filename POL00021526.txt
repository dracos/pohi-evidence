Committee on 6 June 2014.

(b) The General Counsel explained the three options considered and the
specific risks Inherent within each.

it posed to the best interests of the business and value for
money.

¢ Option 3 (moving the governance and management of the
scheme in house) was discounted because of the risk of a
challenge and possible Judicial Review.

« Option 2 (continuing with the Scheme but seeking to refine its
work within the existing Terms of Reference) was the preferred
option.
