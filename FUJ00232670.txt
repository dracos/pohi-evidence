Request Details: I Non technical overview and scope of the change:
Recent audits have
highlighted that
some database roles have access privileges above what would be considered best practice in a financial system.. In
particular there has been a focus on the APPSUP role in the BRDB database.

The APPSUP role was originally designed for use within the Horizon environment, it carried forward into the HNG
databases by default.

‘The APPSUP role was assigned to SSC users as an additional role above their standard default role of DB_MONITOR,
to allow them to manage application related issues.

‘As APPSUP provides enhanced access it has been decided to remove this as a default role from the SSC users. If SSC
require a access to the ROLE for an operational issue this will be re-added to users on a issue by issue basis.
