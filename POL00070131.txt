Lynne further to our chat can you advise what are the names of the postmasters and addresses of the branches if

possible of the following FAD Codes.

442614, 152508, 059025, 132941

In Feb of this year you wrote to Gary Blackburn and he wrote to Shaun Turner and then Sandra MacKay about
these branches which had apparently registered complaints about the HORIZON system. Fujitsu have told us that
in respect of Callendar squarethat there was a problem when stock was transferred from one stock unit to another
but this would only apply when there was more than one stock unit,iemore than one position at the counter.

Did any of you find out what the problems were at the other branches and what did POL and Fujitsu do to correct

them.

Regards
