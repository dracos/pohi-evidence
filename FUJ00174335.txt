Gavin,

We are digging this out.

I would guess that there is nothing specific — but will confirm — other than the common law obligation to maintain
matters confidential. DC should not have any papers/documents/e-mails retained — but he can have his general
recollection of what he took with him from Fujitsu.

I will confirm when we have the contract.

David

Hi David,

I believe David C has/is joining POL in some capacity — can you send me his contracts and highlight the gagging
conditions please — I would like to consider what if any comms we might choose to have with him over his new role.

Kind regards,

Gavin
