Hi

I’m sorry I missed your call Jane.

I’m broadly happy with this but there is one line I’d like to think about and discuss. As well as Mel view i
would also appreciate Patrick view - may we forward this to him?

Hi Jane,

Although I cannot comment on whether there are any legal risks associated with the inclusion of this statement, I wonder
whether we could remove the following wording:

“Post Office does not believe that that this claim valuation is credible or accurate”.

{ think we make this point anyway and by including it we run the risk of irritating the other side, a flurry of letters having
to be exchanged and the lawyers being distracted from the core legal work?

For ease, I have attached a version which reflects this change and swapping “accept” for “stated”, for your consideration.

I cannot see any further risks that need to be flagged.
I agree with swapping "accept" for "they have stated".

Kind regards

All

As flagged last week, we have a meeting of the Board Audit, Risk & Compliance Committee on Thursday afternoon, at
which we will ask the ARC for their views on disclosure.

To that end, I attach a word document showing the draft wording as proposed following the May ARC meeting, and

alternate wording which could be used instead if EY/ the ARC believe that we need to reference the fact that Freeths
flagged numbers in their Skeleton Argument for the costs hearing held on 5 June. This is based on Andy’s draft at the

POL-0020709
POL00024230
POL00024230

end of last week, and shows the changes from the May wording highlighted I yellow, with a couple of suggested
comments from me (in italics).

if there are any views as to the legal and reputational risks of including this statement, we should also present these to
the ARC. One of the key risks is that by putting this number in the ARA, it will give credence to the number
notwithstanding the qualifications. Please let me know asap of any others.

Many thanks,
Jane
