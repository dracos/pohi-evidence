Dear Sirs
REGINA v JANET LOUISE SKINNER

HULL CROWN COURT
CONFISCATION PROCEEDINGS

I write further to your letter of the 15" June 2007 enclosing copy of your Skeleton
Argument on the Abuse of Process.

With regards to your comments raised in paragraph 9 I am informed by the
Investigation Officer that whilst Ms Lyell was interviewed by Humberside Police
there was no evidence to support a prosecution.

I trust the above is of assistance.

Yours faithfully

JA McFarlane
Principal Lawyer
Criminal Law Division
