Subject: RE: Long term incentives for the senior team
Hi Amanda

I have received your email, Amanda, and I appreciate the opportunity to provide input on this subject. In
regards to the LTIP, I suggest the following factors:

+ Postmaster profitability

+ Postmaster remuneration percentage increase (with a set target) factoring in future inflation

« Reduction in central overhead costs

rease in footfall that leads to profitability -
IRRELEVANT :

Commercial deals made over the period and their payback

¢ Postmaster survey results over the last three years

¢ Cultural changes from the PM's perspective

I am disappointed with the management's suggestion, as postmasters have limited control over customer
complaints, and they are aware of this. I am willing to discuss this further and would like to know if it's
possible to have similar input for the STIP.

Regards

lliot Jacobs (

Hi Saf and Elliot, I would welcome your views on the following. The Remuneration Committee is discussing what
would be the most appropriate metrics for the long term incentive scheme (ie potentially pays out in 3 years' time).
We have asked management whether there is a target we could put in to improve the customer experience or
improve footfall into branches (which would then hopefully drive better results for Postmasters).

The team have come up with a target to do with reducing customer complaints. Before we look at that, I was
wondering whether you had any other suggestions?

I look forward to hearing from you.
Best wishes, Amanda
