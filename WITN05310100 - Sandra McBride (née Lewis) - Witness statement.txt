                      POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY



             FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF SANDRA MCBRIDE




I, Sandra McBride, will say as follows...

1. 1 joined the Post Office in May 1986 as a counter clerk at Colchester Branch

   Office, this involved serving customers. After approx. 3 years I moved to the

   Area Office in an admin role. In 1993 I moved to the Training Team as a

   subpostmaster trainer, which involved visiting new postmasters in their

   branches and training them on how to run their post office. In 1997 I was

   promoted to a CM2 manager as a Transactional Knowledge Manager, which

   involved organising and delivering a computer based transactional knowledge

   quiz to subpostmasters in the evenings and branch office staff during the day.

   When this role dissolved, I was trained to deliver classroom new entrant

   counter training for new branch office staff, which I did until my maternity leave

   in May 2000. I returned to work in approx. November 2000 and took up an

   admin role which involved maintaining the New Entrant Counter Training

   Course materials. To enable me to do this I organised a working group

   (consisting of Trainers, Training Managers and a Trainer Coach) who met

   regularly to discuss changes that were required to the training course and
                                    Page 1 of 15

                                                                                      WITNO5310100




   materials as a result of changes to products and services communicated by the

   Business. My role was to ensure agreed changes were made to training course

   materials and the course Training Brief. When the audit team merged with the

   training team, I also was involved in maintaining audit documents and tools

   again with the assistance of auditors and audit managers. I also assisted in the

   development of online training for new entrants. I remained in this type of role

   until I was made redundant in September 2016. From November 2000 to

   September 2016 my role (including my job title) and responsibilities changed

   on a number of occasions and I had different line managers. It's difficult to

   recall my exact roles and responsibilities given that this was over a period of

   almost 16 years. As I left the Post Office over 6 years ago, I have no access to

   any systems/documents which may have helped me remember things in more

   detail.


2. As far as I recall I used a training Horizon system (not live) during occasional

    classroom training I delivered prior to my maternity leave in May 2000. I also

    used the training Horizon system (not live) to identify if training barcodes,

    swipe cards, etc. worked for the New Entrant Counter Training Course as part

    of my role. I also used the live Horizon system occasionally when supporting

    branch offices at Christmas.


3. I was not involved in the initial roll out of the Horizon Training Programme.

   As part of the New Entrant Counter Training Course, the use of Horizon was

   taught on a training Horizon system and as part of my role I maintained the

   training materials for this course. Any changes to the training

   materials/course were discussed and agreed by the working group

   mentioned in section 1, but I can't recall the name of this group. These

                                                                                      WITNO5310100




  changes would include any changes to products/processes which the
  Business was making.


4. I have been asked several questions about my experience as a trainer, which I

   address below. I was originally appointed as a subpostmaster trainer in 1993

   following a business reorganization.


5. I believe I was appointed as trainer in 1993 because I had counter experience

  and some training experience e.g., training local subpostmasters on a system

  called CAPTURE and on the new Royal Mail barcoded labels.


6. I have been asked how much experience I had using the Horizon IT System

  prior to training others on how to use it. As far as I recall I received the

  standard 2 days Horizon training which I believe was delivered by external

   trainers.


7. I have been asked what training I received before I first trained another to use

   the Horizon IT System. I shadowed another trainer delivering the New Entrant

   Counter Training Course on a few occasions before I delivered the course

   myself and was then shadowed. This course used a training Horizon system,

  once Horizon was rolled out to the Counter Training Offices (CTOs), and was

   not live. I did not train anyone on a live Horizon system as far as I can

   remember.


8. I have been asked during which period I trained others to use the Horizon IT

  System. I delivered a few of the New Entrant Counter Training Courses from

   approx. the end of 1999 until May 2000. I cannot recall if these classroom

   courses had the training Horizon system.

                                                                                       WITNO5310100




9. I do not recall receiving any "updating or refresher training"


10.1 have been asked whether I can recall any specific feedback that a

    subpostmaster, counter manager, counter assistant or trainee gave to me

    regarding the Horizon IT System or the training programme. No, I don't recall

    any specific feedback.


11.1 have been asked whether I can recall the gist of any positive or negative

    feedback that subpostmasters, counter managers, counter assistants or

    trainees made regarding the Horizon IT System or the training programme

    No, I don't recall this.


12.1 have been asked whether any changes were made to the training

    programme as a result of feedback given by subpostmasters, counter

    managers, counter assistants or other trainees. As far as I recall the working

    group mentioned in Section 3 above, received a summary of feedback from

    both new entrant classroom and onsite training. Part of the group's role was

    to review the feedback and agree if any changes were necessary.


13.1 have been asked several questions about my experience as a supervisor of

    trainees, which I address below. I supervised a team of trainers on a couple

    of occasions for a period of time after 2000. I cannot recall the exact dates.


14.1 believe I supervised 5 trainers in the East Anglia region for a period of time.

    I also supervised 2 trainers one based in Chester and one based in

    Portsmouth.


15.1 have been asked what my responsibilities were as a supervisor of trainers. I

    was responsible for conducting 121's with the team members and discussing
                                    Page 4 of 15

                                                                                       WITN05310100




   performance feedback from people they trained. I was also responsible for

   cascading any relevant business/team information at team meetings. I was

   also required to visit team members whilst they were training e.g., in the

   classroom or onsite.


16.1 have been asked whether I can recall any specific feedback on the training

   programme, or the gist of the same. No, I don't recall any specific feedback.


17.1 have been asked several questions about the training programme itself,

   which I address below. I was involved in the New Entrant Counter Training

   Course (classroom and onsite) and my role included maintaining the training

   materials. The training course changed in length and content over the years.

   Initially the classroom course was only available to Branch Office staff but

   after making changes it was offered to subpostmasters. I don't know why

   subpostmasters were not initially included in the classroom training. I don't

   recall why this was changed nor when this was. At one point the classroom

   course was up to two weeks, with the first week covering the basic

   transactions, end of day procedures and balancing. The second week covered

   specific additional transactions e.g., Car Tax, Passports, which were only

   available at a small number of branches. As far as I can recall (when

   subpostmasters also attended the course), all subpostmasters were invited to

   attend the first week of classroom training and then received a number of days

   with a trainer onsite at their branch plus support by a trainer onsite with their

   first balance. Subpostmasters were invited to attend the parts of the second

   week of the course according to which additional transactions they were

   allowed to transact at their branch e.g. Car Taxes & Passports.

                                                                                     WITNO5310100




18.As far as I recall the design of the New Entrant Counter Training course was
   agreed by the Working Group mentioned in Section 3.


19.1 have been asked whether the training delivered diverged from the design of

   the training programme. Training Managers were required to spot check their

   teams' delivery of both the classroom and subpostmaster onsite training and to

   address any shortcomings. I can't recall the frequency of this.


20.    The New Entrant Counter Training Course and subpostmaster onsite

   training was running when I joined the Post Office in 1986 and when I left in

   2016. The format and content of which changed over the years.


21.    New entrant training was offered to all new subpostmasters although

   was mandatory for Branch Office staff.


22.    The New Entrant training was arranged for a date as close as possible

   to a new entrant/subpostmaster starting at/taking over their branch.


23.    Counter Training Offices had either 6 or 8 Horizon positions, which limited

   the number of attendees. I don't know the average or range of the numbers

   attending the course. The Scheduling Team based in Salford would have had

   this data.


24.1 have been asked about the content of the training programme and how much

   was focused on the Horizon IT System.. I have provided an overview of the

   content of the New Entrant Counter Training course at paragraph 6. As far as I

   recall the sessions were a mix of product knowledge and use of the Horizon IT

   system. Training materials were obtained for the trainees to practice

   transactions on the Horizon IT system.

                                                                                   WITNO5310100




25. The New Entrant Training Course had a timetable plus training notes

   (Training Brief) which told trainers what to cover during each session. The

   timetable showed how much time was allocated for each session of the

   course. This included sessions on most transactions as well as daily

   accounting, balancing the stock and cash and discrepancies. The trainees

   were given handouts which detailed the end of day process and the weekly

   balancing process. These handouts also included contact details for the

   Helpline/NBSC. I don't recall how much time was allocated for each session.


26.The trainees would be encouraged to ask questions during their training and

   the trainer would answer.


27.1 have been asked whether, and if so how, the competence of trainees to

   use the Horizon IT System was tested at the end of the training programme

   Trainees' competence was tested by way of a practical test at the end of

   week one and week two, where they completed a set of transactions and a

   balance on the training Horizon system. This was checked by the classroom

   trainer.


28.1 have been asked whether I considered that the training programme was

   adequate to enable trainees to use the Horizon IT System generally. My

   answer is yes based on my recollection of the course feedback.


29.1 have been asked whether I considered that the training programme was

   adequate to enable trainees to balance and investigate the cause of

   discrepancies or shortfalls. My answer is yes based on my recollection of the

   course feedback.

30.1 have considered the Counter Training Offices Strategy dated 27 November

    2002 [FUJ00001703] and a document titled "Horizon Upgrade —               December

    2002" [POL00032429]. These documents are over 20 years old so it's very

    difficult to recall full details of my role at the time. As Training Manager, I was

    involved in communicating changes to the training Horizon systems to the

    wider Training Team. I was also involved in ensuring that the support

    materials e.g., paper copies of barcoded bills, were available for use in the

    classroom training courses.


31. The CTO's were used for delivering the classroom aspect of the New Entrant

    Counter Training Course.


32.1 can recall that the training Horizon systems in the CTO's were not always

    up to date so trainers had to talk through some transactions that could not

    be completed on the training Horizon system. When we first received the

    training Horizon systems I don't recall us having input into what was on the

    systems.


33.1 don't recall the process for updating the training systems in the CTO's. Apart

    from upgrade mentioned in the document titled "Horizon Upgrade —

    December 2002 [POL00032429], I can't recall any further examples.


34.1 don't know why the upgrade in December 2002 was the first in two years.

    The lack of an upgrade to the system would have made it more difficult for the

    trainer to show trainees how to complete certain transactions on the training

    Horizon system. These transactions would be talked through by the trainer in

    the CTO and explained and/or shown in more detail during the onsite training

    in branch.

                                                                                         WITN05310100




35.1 don't know why it wasn't possible to scan P&A books in normal mode.

   Workarounds were developed, i.e. using Training Mode as described in the

   document.


36.1 have been asked whether, aside from reference data, there would ever be

   differences between the software on the training systems in the CTOs and

   those used in the live estate. There probably were differences between

   software on the training systems in the CTOs and that used in the live estate

   as the training Horizon system was not live, but I don't recall any details. As far

   as I recall my role did not include any involvement in the Horizon software nor

   is this an area I have any expertise in.


37.1 have considered a PowerPoint presentation titled "Outlet Field Team HYS

   Issues and Updates" [POL00032430]. I think the specific issue may have

   been that when a call was made by a trainer to the Horizon Helpdesk to

    report a faulty processor/keypad it was not always established that this

   hardware was for a training office. Therefore, the engineer would bring live

   estate hardware rather than a training one and may not have been aware of

   the difference.


38. I believe I would have raised this issue with Fujitsu using specific examples

    provided by the team. I would have expected Fujitsu to update their Helpdesk

   staff to ensure that they understand the difference between a live branch and a

   CTO. I don't recall exact details of this.


39.1 have been asked whether further training was available to subpostmasters,

   counter assistants or other trainees who, following the training programme,

    requested it or were deemed by the Post Office to require it. As far as I recall
                                     Page 9 of 15
                                                                                         WITNO5310100
                                                                                       WITNO5310100




    new entrants could request further training if required via the NBSC/Helpline. I

    believe there was also a team based at Dartford who would provide telephone
    support for SPMs with issues.


40.1 don't recall having contact with subpostmasters or managers and assistants

    beyond training.


41.1 have been asked a number of questions on whether I provided advice and

    assistance to subpostmasters, counter managers or assistants beyond

    training. As far as I recall I was not responsible for providing subpostmasters

    or Post Office branches with advice or assistance


42.1 have been asked whether I was involved in or party to any disputes between

    the Post Office and subpostmasters regarding shortfalls. I was not involved in

    or party to any disputes between the Post Office and subpostmasters.


43.1 have been asked about the process for raising and resolving such disputes.

    lam not aware of the detailed process but I believe the first point of contact

    was the NBSC/Helpline.


44.1 have been asked whether I am aware of Fujitsu having any contact or input

    within this process. No, I am not aware.


45.1 have been asked several questions concerning the process of auditing

    branch accounts. As far as I recall the Audit Team were responsible for

    conducting audits. I don't know the minimum levels of qualifications or

    experience. The Training Team were merged with the Audit Team and

    auditors were trained to be trainers and vice versa. I do not recall when this

    took place.

                                                                                     WITNO5310100




46. Prior to the Audit Team merging with the Training Team I do not know what

    training was given to auditors. After the merger I believe trainers were given

    training on how to use the audit tools and then shadowed auditors onsite and

    were then shadowed by auditors.


47.1 believe new subpostmasters were audited after a certain period of time

    following their new entrant training. I do not recall other circumstances in

    which Post Office would decide to carry out an audit of a branch.


48.The process that auditors had to follow to carry out an audit was detailed in

    the Audit Process Manual. 1 do not recall the content of this manual.


49.1 am not aware of what information an auditor had access to or could access.


50.1 am not aware whether auditors had special privileges to insert or modify

    data in Horizon.


51. As far as I can recall the Team Leaders were responsible for supervising

    auditors. I don't recall what training the Team Leaders received.


52.1 don't recall the process by which policies on auditing would be reviewed.


53.1 have considered a PowerPoint presentation titled "Audit Review Cascade"

    and dated 28 September 2011 [POL00085658]." I don't recall the context or

    who commissioned the review and why. I believe this question should be

    addressed to Sue Richardson.


54.1 don't recall my work on this review


55.As far as I was aware the audit processes were adequate.

56.1 don't recall what changes were made as a result of this review other than

    those actions mentioned in the document.


57.Other than the example given in section 35 regarding the training Horizon

    system, I was not aware of any bugs, errors or defects within the Horizon

    system.


58.1 have considered a document titled "Global User Accounts" [POL00002841].

    As the document states there were two types of Global User Account.

    Trainer & Audit. The Trainer Global User allowed trainers to reset the

    Horizon Training systems in CTOs. The Audit Global User allowed an auditor

    to add themselves to a branch Horizon system when conducting an audit (if

    no one at the branch had manager level to do this) so that they could print

    off reports required for the audit. I don't know if this allowed the user to

    insert, modify or delete data within branch accounts.


59. As the Global User Accounts document states, I maintained the list of Global

    User Accounts for the Outlet Support Team (previously known as the

    Training Team). This means that I requested and approved Global User

    accounts to be opened and closed for the Outlet Support Team e.g., when a

    new member of the team joined or left.


60.1 have been asked to describe what, if any, security measures and / or audit

    measures were in place in respect of Global User Accounts. Each month I

    received a list of the Global User Accounts for the Outlet Support Team,

    which I checked against the current team members to ensure that new
