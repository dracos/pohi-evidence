JUDGE PHIPPS: Members of the jury, as I told you yesterday
you are the judges of facts in this case. In summing the case

up to you I have two tasks, the first is to direct you as
to the law which applies in this case and the second task
is to remind you of the prominent features of the
evidence.

So far as the first of those tasks are concerned, the law,
the directions I give you as to the law you must accept
and you must follow. But the facts, I repeat, that is
your province. It has always been your responsibility to
judge the evidence and decide the relevant facts of this
case and when you come to consider your verdicts you, and
you alone, must do that. You will do that having regard
to all of the evidence you have heard, the evidence you
heard from the witness box, the evidence you have seen in
the documents and the formal admissions, which are there
in the bundle that you have.

You decide whether a witness was honest or truthful or
accurate, doing his or her best to help you or not. The
defendant has chosen to give evidence and you must judge
that evidence by precisely the same fair standards as you
judge all the evidence in the case. You will wish, no
doubt, to take account of the arguments you have heard in
the speeches from counsel but you are not bound to accept
them.

In the same way, members of the jury, if in the course of
my review of the evidence I appear to express any views
concerning the facts, or emphasise a particular aspect of
the evidence, do not adopt those views unless you agree
with them. By the same token, if I fail to mention
something which you regard as important, you have regard
to it and give it such weight as you think fit. Ina
sentence, members of the jury, when it comes to the facts
of this case you, and you alone, are the judges.

This prosecution is brought by the Post Office. They are
a body, an authority like other authorities such as
Customs and Excise who are empowered by law to bring
prosecutions themselves. But the law in respect of this
prosecution is the same as in any other prosecution. The
prosecution bring the case and it follows that the
prosecution must prove it. In this case the prosecution
must prove that this defendant is guilty in respect of
each of the counts charged against her. The defendant
does not have to prove her innocence. What the law refers
to as the burden of proof begins and remains throughout
with the prosecution.

The prosecution succeed in proving a defendant's guilt by
making you, the jury, sure of guilt. Nothing less than
that will do. If after considering all the evidence in
respect of the count which you are considering you are
sure that the defendant guilty of that count, then you
must return a verdict of guilty. If you are not sure,
then your verdict must be not guilty.

There are 32 separate counts requiring your separate
DB - 0051

wo

POL00066713
POL00066713

BRENNAN - 005

consideration. Each of those counts alleges theft.

Theft, members of the jury, is the dishonest appropriation
- that is taking - of property belonging to another
intending that the true owner should not get it back. So
there must first of all be an appropriation, a taking of
property, in this case of course money. With the
intention of permanently depriving the owner, that is the
Post Office, of it, and that taking must be dishonest.
Members of the jury, it is not disputed, it is not
challenged that the sums referred to in each of these
counts has gone missing. Those discrepancies are
admitted. s they were errors on her part
because of and pressures at work. She
says she did not takethe Tioney at all. She does not know
what happened to it. So those are the questions for you,
members of the jury. First of all: are you sure that the
defendant took the money? And the associated question:
were these discrepancies as a result of her dishonesty or
her incompetence? It is not for the defendant to satisfy
you that she was incompetent, it is for the prosecution to
satisfy you so that you are sure that she was dishonest.
So to convict this defendant on all or any of these counts
you must be sure that she acted dishonestly.

She is a lady of good character. She has no criminal
convictions. She had a career with the Post Office in its
various incarnations which lasted for many years. Of
course, members of the jury, the fact that she is a woman
of good character cannot by itself provide a defence to
these charges, but it is evidence which you should take
into account in her favour in the following ways.

First of all, she gave evidence and it supports her
credibility. It means that it is a factor which you
should take into account when deciding whether you believe
what she has told you. Secondly, members of the jury, it
may also mean that she is less likely than might otherwise
be the case to commit these offences with which she is
charged. As I have said to you, these are matters which
you should have regard in the defendant's favour. It is
for you to decide what weight you should give to them in
this case.

Members of the jury, Miss Brennan worked as a Post Office
counter clerk, doing the various tasks that a Post Office
counter clerk does from selling postage stamps to issuing
vehicle excise licences. She had worked for the Post
Office, or whatever it has been from time to time called,
for 18 years, including her time at sub post offices, and
she had been at Huyton for seven years or so. The branch
manager at Huyton, Mrs. Rosenthal, described her as an
exceptionally good counter clerk, efficient, accurate and
very helpful.

Of particular relevance to the matters which you are
considering here of course was one of her tasks, and that
was dealing with pensions and allowances. There are 14

DB - 0052

wo

POL00066713
POL00066713

BRENNAN - 006

different categories, members of the jury, you will
remember, each with its own reference number for
accounting purposes. Child benefit, for example, you were
told is number 5 in that categorisation.

The procedures are computerised, as of course these days
you would expect. The particular system used in the Post
Office is called Horizon. Again, the procedure for
cashing these benefits, these allowances, is, you may
think, as you might expect. The prosecution say the
procedure is, first of all, the book. You have examples
of the book. The book is presented. The procedure is
that it should be checked to see that the benefit in
question is payable at that particular office. The bar
code on the front here is scanned which puts all the
information about the book on to the operator's computer
screen. The date of the docket - these are the dockets
here of course - is checked to see that it can be properly
cashed, that is on the due date.

Members of the jury, pausing there for a moment, the
defendant told you in cross-examination that the details
in the book were not checked in reality, you just checked
on the computer screen to see whether to pay or not to
pay. That is what the defendant said. The procedure is
as described by Mrs. Rosenthal.

The docket and the counterfoil, they are date stamped and
they are date stamped of course with the counter clerk's
own individual stamp. In the defendant's case that date
stamp is B, you can see it, you have seen it on the
exhibits.

Then the number of dockets being cashed is entered on to
the computer, one or two, whatever. Then the computer
asks the operator how much the docket is or dockets are
for and that amount is keyed in by the operator. That is
the crucial task, is it not, the keying in of the amount
to be paid over the counter. That amount having been put
into the computer, the computer will then instruct the
operator as to the amount to be paid, and the customer is
paid in cash. That is how the system should operate.
Each counter clerk has her or his own stock with its own
reference number and at the end of each day the computer
prints out a daily summary of the work carried out by that
clerk, and it is the clerk's duty to check his or her own
cash, stock and vouchers, dockets, and see that they
balance at the end of the day. The accounting week runs
from Thursday morning to Wednesday evening and each
Wednesday evening there is an office accounting. In
respect of pensions and allowances' payments the clerks
will wrap the computer summary around all of the vouchers
that have been used that week, paid out that week, ina
bundle and at the end of the week all of those bundles
will be placed with the office summary, all of the office
transactions, and put in a sealed plastic pouch and sent
off to Northern Ireland, the Paid Order Unit at

Lisserhally(?)

Lisserhally deals with pensions and allowances payments
records for the whole of the U.K., and so, members of the
jury, checks are made on a random basis, spot checks,
periodically. As a result of one such check at
Lisserhally Mr. Bradshaw, an investigation manager from
whom you heard, was called in to investigate at Huyton
Post Office. He referred to p. 19 in the bundle, so we
will have a look at that together, members of the jury. I
am sorry, we must first look at p. 18 in the bundle.

This is the printout, the Horizon printout relating to 6th
June, the day that Mr. Bradshaw went into the office to
make his enquiries. As a matter of fact, members of the
jury, this summary report relates to the last count on the
indictment, count 32, because of course it was at the end
of the period that you are concerned when Mr. Bradshaw was
making his enquiries.

We will just have a look at that together. You will see,
members of the jury, at the top the time, 15:06, six
minutes past three in the afternoon when the printout was
made. The 6th June. "CAP 11" is cash account period and
"11" of course is week 11. At the extreme top right-hand
corner "BB SUBB" "SU" is stock unit and "BB" that is the
stock unit referrable to this defendant, Miss Brennan.
Then there is a list of that day's child benefit. There
is the number 5, of course that is the reference number
for child benefit. Reading it down, the price, volume,
value. Three at £15.75, two at £36.85, two at £38.65, two
at £63, one of £105.20 and one at £226.30. Eleven
vouchers to a total value of £655.75.

Before we look at those vouchers just look at the bottom
of that exhibit and you will see the date stamp with the
letter "B" on it under "Huyton, Liverpool". That, of
course, is this defendant's date stamp.

Now, members of the jury, over the page, pp. 19 and 20.
There are the eleven vouchers that are detailed on the
printout. There is no voucher at all in the sum of
£226.30, but what there is is a voucher for £26.30. Of
course you will remember Mr. Bradshaw pointed that out to
you as being to the right-hand of those two middle
vouchers on p. 19, it looks signed "S. Beaumont", it is
that one. Do you see it, members of the jury, p. 19,
£26.30. What the prosecution say is that was typed in not
as £26.30 but £226.30. So we have count 32 alleging the
theft of £200.

Now turn over to p. 21. This is part of the transaction
summary showing the transactions carried out that day in
detail. Members of the jury, you will see that on each of
these transactions appears the code number "LBROO01", that
of course is the defendant's code number. The relevant
transaction here is the fourth one down, child benefit
£226.30. You will remember Mr. Bradshaw told you that
this was part of three transactions but for the same

POL00066713
POL00066713

DB - 0054 BRENNAN - 008

q customer. The customer reference appears next to "LBROO1"

q as "7/947602". So the two immediately before and

4 immediately after the relevant one is the same customer,

4 1841 and 9879. The total of the three amounts paid out to

q that customer was £343.50, on the face of it, which was

£200 than the vouchers were for.

q That was on the day that Mr. Bradshaw attended the office.
Investigations were made as to other discrepancies and

q the results are then put by Mr. Bradshaw in these

1 schedules in your bundle. So let us go through them.

14 First of all schedule at p. 11. This is simply the list

14 of Horizon users, members of the jury. We have already

1 dealt with this. You will see that eight up from the

14 bottom "LBROO1 Clerk", that is Miss Brennan.

iq Then at pp. 12 and 13, the next two pages, this is a list

1 of each of the weeks in the period which we are reviewing,

iq that is 19th December 2001 to 12th June 2002, giving the

1 week number, the date stamp used, the stock unit issued

1 and any absences from work or closures of the office. You

2 will see that that year Good Friday was on 29th March,

2] Easter Monday on ist April. You can see that from the

24 "office closed" column. There was a Bank Holiday, if you

2 look at the next page, on 6th May.

24 Absences from work, this would have been Miss Brennan's

2g absences. You will see she was absent from Monday the

2 1lth to Wednesday 13th February and then again the 14th to

27 16th February, and then again in April, the 15th to 20th

2 April. Then the 13th to 18th May. Those were her

2 absences from work apart from Bank Holidays during that

3 period.

3] Then, members of the jury, the schedule which appears at

34 pp. 14, 15 and 16. This really is the heart of the

3 prosecution's allegations here because it lists the

34 discrepancies in respect of each count of the indictment.

3 The one that we have just been looking at of course is

3 right at the very end on p. 16. Just so we can check it

37 again, the very last there, cash account week 11, date of

3 computer printout 6th June 2002, voucher group number 5,

3 cash amount £226.30, amount of voucher due for payment

4 £26.30, amount of overclaim £200, date stamp indicator B,

4) stock unit 88. Then indictment number, that is the count

4q in the indictment number of course, count 32. That is the

4q one we have looked at in detail and you were told about in

44 detail by Mr. Bradshaw and that is where it appears on the

4g schedule.

4 That is the schedule of each of these discrepancies

4q relating you to each of the counts of the indictment,

4 starting at week 40, 20th December 2001 an overclaim of

4 £100 on a voucher group number 7. We do not know what

5 that is but 5 we do know is child benefit, the next one

5y 27th December an overpayment of £50 because instead of

5q £36.20 being entered £86.20 was entered, and that is count

5 2. Members of the jury, that is schedule of

POL00066713
POL00066713

DB - 0055 BRENNAN - 009

q discrepancies.

q Then on p. 17 this schedules shows the discrepancies

q compared with the declared balance. You will see that in
4 that, for example in the first week 27th December 2001,

q although there is £150 discrepancy in declared pensions

submissions, Miss Brennan's balance at the end of that
q week was just at £1.21 under. So, as Mrs. Rosenthal said,
it was an extraordinarily good balance at the end of that

q week despite the fact of the £150 payment out which should
1 not have been paid out. Over the whole office you will

iy see the declared balance for the office £105.29 surplus

14 that is all of the 10 clerks who were working in the

1 office at the time. You will see from that schedule that
14 this defendant's balance at the end of the week generally
14 balanced pretty well.

1 The total over claimed in this period, as

1]Mr. Bradshaw told you, was £3,482.40 and Mr. Bradshaw said if

1 these were genuine mistakes then that difference would be
1 reflected in the end of the week balances, that is as
2 shown on p. 17 of the bundle. In fact, the total over the
21) period, balance, for Miss Brennan was a shortfall of just
2q £291.30, that is during the period when this £3,500,
2 nearly, went out that should not have gone out.
24 Mr. Bradshaw then referred to another particular
24 transaction, and it appears at p. 22, members of the jury,
2 in your bundle. This document relates to count 12 in the
2] indictment. You will see there it is the same as the

2 other one we were looking at, the printout for 6th June,

2 except this printout is 3lst January 2002. Dealing with

3 child benefits you will see a total of 18 vouchers had

3y gone into the computer to an amount of little over £800, I
34 think it is £809.70, or perhaps £803 or £808 perhaps but

3 it does not really matter very much, just over £800

34 There are 18 vouchers you will see under the "volume"

3 column, that is 18 vouchers have gone through, but there

3 was no voucher at all, said Mr. Bradshaw, for £125.25,

37 which is the penultimate voucher in that list. Do you see
3 it? £125.25, no voucher for that said Mr. Bradshaw. The
3 nearest he could find was the voucher in the bottom right-
4 hand corner for £25.85. That was one voucher from the old
4q book and one voucher from the new book.

4q What should happen in that situation is that the operator
4q would key in that there were two vouchers and it would be
44 added up by the computer. But here it was put in, he

4q said, as two separate transactions. That relates to count
4 12, as I have said, members of the jury.

4] Those were the documents that Mr. Bradshaw referred you to
4 dealing with each of these accounts. Mr. Bradshaw said

4 that he checked with the branch manager and it was Postal
5 Headquarters at Chesterfield, the Accounts Department,

5] whether there were any other error notices in respect of
5” Miss Brennan. He said that there was no trace of any

5 error notices in respect of any other field of work, apart

POL00066713
POL00066713

DB - 0056 BRENNAN - 010

q from pensions and allowances.

q Before leaving that, he told Mr. Simms in cross-

q examination that the check on the other work, that is non-
4 pensions and allowances work, by Miss Brennan was carried
q out either by the branch manager or at Chesterfield and

Mr. Bradshaw himself had not checked any other person's
q work personally.
The defendant was interviewed. You have the transcript of

q the interview, it has been read to you. You can read it

1 at your leisure when you go to your room. There is no

iq point my reading it all over to you again now. What Miss
14 Brennan said when she was interviewed is, you may think,

1 pretty much what she told you when she gave evidence,

14 members of the jury.

14 Mr. Bradshaw told Mr. Simms that Miss Brennan was asked if
1 she had any financial problems and she said she had not.
1q Mr. Bradshaw said he had no reason to think that she did,
1 if that is what she said he was prepared to accept it.

1 There was no indication that she was living the life of
2 luxury, as Mr. Simms had put to him.
2] Mr. Simms also put in via Mr. Bradshaw the other exhibit
24 which I have marked exhibit 7 which goes in two sections,
2 p. 17 it starts and then p. 41 again. This was the form
24 205A which had been prepared at Northern Ireland and it
24 was from this document that Mr. Bradshaw had extracted the
2 information to go on to his schedules. So it is a fuller
27 document, members of the jury, and it is there for you to
2 look at and consider as you wish.
2 Miss Rosenthal had tol.
3 that Miss Brennan was GRO
3] prior to Miss Brennan's suspension, although she became
34 aware of it then. She agreed with Mr. Simms that there
3 had been an occasion when she had used the counter stocks
34 at Huyton without logging on with her own identity, this
3 is Miss Rosenthal. It happened a year ago she said. She
3 told Mr. Simms that when she had worked at Old Swan prior
37 to Huyton that was an accepted practice at Old Swan, even
3 though it was an incorrect practice it was a practice that
3 was carried on at Old Swan and she assumed that it would
4 be acceptable in Huyton, but it was not.
4) There was also an occasion when she agreed with Mr. Simms
4q that Bedelia's, another counter clerk, work had to be
4g checked and an error in the sum of £63 was found. Miss
44 Rosenthal agreed that she decided to leave it rather than
4g correct it and make the balance even worse. She agreed
4 that that was a bad decision and that she received a
4q formal warning from Jan Mullen for taking that decision.
4 The defendant was to tell you that it was she who had
4 checked Bedelia's figures on that occasion. That was not
5 Miss Rosenthal's recollection, but other than that I think
5y it is right to say that the evidence was agreed on both
54 sides as to that aspect of it.
5 Miss Rosenthal agreed that Linda Buchanan worked at Huyton

POL00066713
POL00066713

DB - 0057 BRENNAN - 011

y but she did not recollect an occasion when her mistakes
q were being attributed to the defendant, although certainly
4 it appears to be the case that that did happen.
4 Miss Rosenthal told Miss Williams that she had found other
q discrepancies in Bedelia's work, some weeks nothing at
all, other weeks she would have a bad balance. She
q described Bedelia as having a huge crisis of confidence
and so she was prepared to accept it from Bedelia on that
q basis it seems. She did not suspect any dishonesty on
1 Bedelia's behalf but she was making errors in all her
14 work, so it was incompetence rather than dishonesty
iq thought Miss Rosenthal.
1 Lisa Brennan told you, as I have reminded you, she is a
14 lady of good character with a career at the Post Office.
iq Her daughter is now seven. She was earning £200 a week or
1 so at the Post Office, more with overtime. There had been
174 no complaints at all about her work, no disciplinary
1 action at all prior to this, But she has told you that at

24 was so busy and not such a nice place to work, and it was
2 hard work, although she told Mr. Bradshaw in interview
27 that she loved her job, but you will remember her
2 explanation for that.

4] Mrs. Mullen in July last year there was a letter she
4 received giving details of all the mistakes she had made
4 and she noticed that some mistakes against her name were

GRO

She produced her bundle of bank statements and so
you, members of the jury, which you can have a look
at when you retire, always in credit over this period.
She produced a mini statement when she was interviewed by

Mr. Bradshaw. She has told you this: "I wish I could say
how the discrepancies arose. I couldn't believe it when I
heard about these matters." She denied stealing any

money. She agreed with Miss Williams that she knew the
job inside out; that when she first started with the Post
Office she did not use computers, they had not been
brought in then, so everything was done manually and the
additions were done in her head. She told Miss Williams:
"I must have been crap at the time, I was going through
an awful time. I shouldn't have been at work" but she
told you that you are not a wed to take time off work.

You are entitled to} . GRO ae
but sh _...GRO im

GRO _ i} She had not complained to
her Line Manager. She said the work had to be done: "You

just do the job and get on with it."
But she accepted that the discrepancies that the
prosecution complain of were there. There were the
discrepancies. She makes no argument about that. She
said to Miss Williams: "Well, if it was someone else I
would say it was impossible for £3,500 worth of
discrepancies to be built up over this period, and indeed
when I first heard about it I couldn't believe it either."
I am going to ask you to retire, members of the jury, to
consider your verdicts, but before you do I have some
instructions for you. The first is this, the verdicts
that I ask you to return are verdicts in respect of which
each of the 12 of you be agreed, unanimous verdicts,
please.
You will I am sure know that in certain circumstances a
court can accept a verdict which is not the verdict of the
whole jury. The circumstances in which this court could
accept such verdicts have not arisen and may never arise.
If they were to arise then I would send for you and give
you another direction. But until I send for you,
unanimity, please, is required, that is verdicts upon
which each one of the 12 of you be agreed.
When you come back into court one of you is going to have
to speak on behalf of you all to announce what your
verdicts are and to answer the simple questions put to you
by a clerk of the court, who I hope will be here for that
purpose then. Can I please ask you to select, elect, or
somehow pick one of your number to discharge that duty on
behalf of you all. It may be that such person could also

chair your discussions, but how you carry on your
discussions if, of course, entirely a matter for you. So
can I ask you, please, to pick a foreman or forewoman to
discharge that function for you.
All of the exhibits are in the file. You have the
additional documents that were put before you by Mr. Simms
whilst he was cross-examining Mr. Bradshaw. I see you
have the sample books, and that is, I think, it. Once the
jury bailiff has been sworn I will ask you to retire.
(Jury bailiff, sworn)

JUDGE SWIFT: Mr. Simms, the jury also have, of course, the

bundle that your client put in.

Mr. SIMMS: The financial documents, yes.

JUDGE SWIFT: The financial documents.

(The jury retired to consider their verdicts at 12.50 p.m.)
(Later)
(In the absence of the jury)

JUDGE SWIFT: It is coming up to half past four, I propose to

send the jury home and they can carry on tomorrow morning. It
seems to me the appropriate course to take would be for
the clerk to ask if they have reached verdicts on any of
the 32 counts. If they have then we can take those
verdicts, if not then they carry on tomorrow. Do you
agree, Mr. Simms.

Mr. SIMMS: I do, yes.

(The jury returned to court at 4.26 p.m.

THE CLERK: Will the foreman please stand. Mr. Foreman, will
you please answer my first question either "yes" or "no",
has the jury reached a verdict upon which you are all
agreed in relation to any of the 32 counts on this
indictment?

THE FOREMAN: No.

JUDGE SWIFT: Members of the jury, it is half past four. You

have been deliberating for some time now and I am not going to
require you to deliberate any further this afternoon, I am
going to let you go home and you can continue your
deliberations tomorrow morning.

It has always been important, and it is most particularly
important now, that after you have left court you should
not discuss this case with anyone else or allow anyone
else to discuss it with you. It is the essence of the
jury system, you should reach your verdicts when you are
together in your jury room and that your verdicts should
be based only on the evidence and arguments which you have
heard in court.

So once you have left court this evening you should not
seek any further evidence or information about the case.
You should not discuss the case amongst yourselves or
attempt to contact one another to discuss the case. When
you return tomorrow morning you should go straight to your
jury room but do not discuss the case until I have asked
you to come back into court, sworn in the jury bailiff in
your presence and asked you to retire to your room to

THE CLERK: Guilty. Thank you.

JUDGE SWIFT: Thank you very much indeed. Miss Williams, the
jury have failed to reach verdicts on three counts.
Miss WILLIAMS: Yes, number 3, 12 and 16.
JUDGE SWIFT: Do you want them to continue to consider those
counts?
Miss WILLIAMS: At this stage, your Honour, yes, I think that
would probably be appropriate.
JUDGE SWIFT: Members of the jury, thank you very much. That
leaves counts 3, 12 and 16. I ask you to retire again to
continue to reach unanimous verdicts if you can. If you
are unable to do so in respect of those three counts then
I can now accept verdicts from you upon which at least 10
of you be agreed. Try to be unanimous, if you cannot then
I can accept verdicts in respect of which at least 10 of
you be agreed in respect of those three remaining counts,
counts 3, 12 and 16.
(The jury further retired at 2.40 p.m.)
(The jury returned with further verdicts
at 3.14 p.m.)

THE CLERK: Your Honour, six hours and three minutes have
elapsed since the jury first retired to consider their
verdict. Mr. Foreman, will you please answer my next
question either "yes" or "no". Have at least 10 of you
agreed upon your verdicts relating to counts 3, 12 and 16
remaining on this indictment?

THE FOREMAN: Yes.

THE CLERK: Again, will you please answer only "guilty" or
"not guilty" to my next question. Do you find the
defendant on count 3 guilty or not guilty?

THE FOREMAN: Guilty.

THE CLERK: Is that the verdict of you all or by a majority?

THE FOREMAN: Majority.

THE CLERK: How many of you agreed and how many dissented?
