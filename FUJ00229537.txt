POL has requested transaction records for the Ferndale Road Post Office - FAD 008008 - for
the period January 2005 to August 2011.

years; therefore a few days of April 2005 will be currently available but prior records are not available.

* This estimate covers the period May 2005 to August 2011 - 76 months of transaction records.

* This data will be retrieved from records held on audit servers and is specific to the Branch and the timeframe stipulated.

* There are no ongoing commitments.

Estimated Timescale: 30 mandays over an elasped 5 week period
Estimated Cost: £50,538

Actual delivery time may exceed estimate and actual costs will be charged at time and

Penny,
Certainly not that urgent.

If you could get me a figure some time this week that would be fantastic. If it needs a lot of work then let me know.

Could we ask Penny to have a quick look and advise please? My initial view is that this is OK as a ROM request.
