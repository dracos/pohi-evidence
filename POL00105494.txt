Please refer to the emails below. Oliver Letwin has confirmed he will join the meeting with James
Arbuthnot (plus Alice and Paula) on the 17 May at 10:30. Who will be preparing a brief, do we need a
premeet and who will collect them from reception. Will they be going straight to the Model Office.

Kind regards

I have been asked to contact you to make arrangements for Oliver Letwin to visit us, if possible in conjunction
with James Arbuthnot, when.Paula Vennells and her team will explain the Horizon system.

James Arbuthnot has confirmed the 17 May at 10:30. Is this suitable to the Minister? If not, I would be
grateful if you could suggest some dates/times that would be convenient.

Kind regards
Theresa
