4.4.2

Users may only log-on to the OPS in their Branch in accordance with their
defined role. Any access to data or services outside of that Branch is
controlled exclusively by the relevant counter application.

Access to OPS and Post Office Services offered via OPS to Users
working in the Branches shall be controlled by a mechanism conforming
to the CCD entitled “HNGX-UI Style Guide” (DES/APP/STD/0001)
(formerly “Horizon Office Platform Service Style Guide” (SD/STD/001)),
offering multiple access levels and providing specific identification of
each User. An exception to this is the Mails Application which does not
conform to the “HNGX-UI Style Guide” (DES/APPS/STD/0001) (formerly
“Horizon Office Platform Service Style Guide” (SD/STD/001)).

Authentication of all Users logging on to the OPS in the Branch shall be
undertaken by the elements of Horizon Service Infrastructure on which
OPS is based. Full access control and password management facilities
shall be provided. Users shall only access those Horizon Applications for
which they have been given permission by the Branch. Each User shall
be identified by a unique User-id and individual password.

The OPS shall provide facilities to enable the Branch Manager to
establish new Users and set an initial password for all Users in a Branch.
Should a User forget their password the Branch Manager shall be able
to reset the password. The same procedure shall apply at single Counter
Position Branches and multiple Counter Position Branches.

For situations where the sole User (e.g. Branch Manager in a single
Counter Position Branch) has forgotten their password, the OPS shall
provide the facility to generate a unique key as part of the log-on to a
specific username. This shall be telephoned to the Help Desk who shall
provide the corresponding key which, when input to OPS, shall allow
access to the administration facilities. The User shall then be able to reset
their User password.

Concurrency

The Pathway solution for OPS is based on a PC infrastructure configured such
that multiple activities within a Branch do not significantly impact on each other.
In particular, back office processes (e.g. report production) will be operated on a

Schedule B4.3 Version 13.0

OPS, and the elements of Horizon Service Infrastructure on which OPS is
provided, shall be able to be connected via RS-232 ports, and shall support such
connection, to specialist peripherals in such a way that the specialist peripherals
may be accessed by one or more Counter Position PCs. In such a case it shall
be possible to restrict access to a subset of the Counter Position PCs in each
Branch. This capability shall not be applicable to PIN Pads which can not be
connected to or accessed by more than one Counter Position PC at any one
time.

46 Security

4.6.1

Security of data and audit trail for OPS

4.6.1.1 All data captured at a Branch either as part of a Transaction performed
at a Counter Position or as an administration function shall form part of a
unique Transaction which shall be given a unique reference number by
Riposte and details stored in the message store. The format of this
message store entry shall vary according to the Transaction type but will
typically contain:

(a) Post Office ID;

(b) Counter Position ID;

(h) Transaction details.

4.6.1.2 Each Counter Position PC shall contain a journal and all journal entries
shall be automatically replicated to all other members of the work group.
Awork group shall include all the Counter Position PCs in the Branch and
one of the correspondence servers, at which TMS is provided. This
correspondence server forms part of a “cluster” of correspondence
servers of which two are located on one Data Centre site and the
remaining two located on the other Data Centre site. All Transactions
associated with one correspondence server are automatically replicated
to the other site. Within each site all Transactions are reliably mirrored
within a multiple disk array which has no single point of failure.

4.6.1.3 Once data are stored in the message store they shall never be altered.
New Transactions shall always be appended to the message store.
Retrieval of data using a particular key field shall retrieve all entries
containing that field.

4.6.1.4 The security of data held within OPS shall not be compromised by any
Incident nor when OPS is re-established following any Incident.

4.6.1.5 Fujitsu Services shall provide synchronisation facilities which shall
automatically check the status of the journal for a node when it is re-
established following failure. Should the journal be out of step (e.g.
through failure of the Counter Position PC) Fujitsu Services shall
automatically synchronise the journal and any data files to the same state
as all other journals in that work group. Synchronisation may occur from
another Counter Position PC (in a multi-Counter Position Branch) or from
one of the correspondence servers or the second hard disk referred to in
paragraph 6.2.4.2 (in a single Counter Position Branch).

4.6.1.6 The operating system supporting the OPS shall provide assurance of
access control and data integrity functions.

4.6.2 OPS Secure Suspension

4.6.2.1 The OPS and the elements of the Horizon Service Infrastructure on which

reactivated by the User entering their password. Any Horizon
Applications which were active shall be left active. The display
presented when the suspension facility is activated shall be
different to any normal desktop or Horizon Application screen; or

suspend a customer session and start a second session, and
thereafter swap between the two sessions until one of them has
been completed.

While an individual Transaction is waiting for input from a peripheral, a
pick-list or on-line interaction, or while reports or receipts are printing,
these facilities may be inhibited.

4.6.2.3 Should the User who initiated the suspension be unable to re-activate the
facility, the following actions may be taken:

(a)

(b)

(c)

session shall be automatically logged-out. A journal message will
be created indicating this;

the Branch Manager may assume responsibility for any
uncompleted session, the Stock Unit or share thereof, by
entering his own User name / password;

once the Counter Position PC has logged-out, any authorised
User may then use that Counter Position PC; and

all the above Events shall be written to the journal.

4.6.2.4 The facility shall allow the User to resume work with the minimum delay
consistent with achieving security in accordance with the provisions

hereof.

4.6.3 Inactivity Time-out

6. GENERAL INFRASTRUCTURE SERVICES REQUIREMENTS

6.1 Introduction

This section contains characteristics common to both the OPS and TMS Infrastructure
Services.

Schedule B4.3 Version 13.0

CONFIDENTIAL

6.2 Links from OPS to TMS

6.2.1

General

6.2.1.1

6.2.1.2

6.2.1.3

Each instance of OPS within Branches shall interface with TMS to allow
the transfer, in both directions, of authorised data files and messages.

The transfer of data between OPS and TMS shall be secure, complete,
accurate and robust.

Within OPS it shall be possible for OPS to identify whether data from
OPS have been received by TMS or not.

Data Replication

6.2.2.1

6.2.2.2

6.2.2.3

6.2.2.4

6.2.2.5

6.2.2.6

Fujitsu Services shall use data replication and synchronisation
techniques to ensure that data transfer between Counter Positions at
which OPS is provided and between instances of OPS at each Counter
Position and the TMS are secure, complete, accurate and robust.

Once a Transaction has been settled at a Counter Position, TMS shall
commit the full Transaction details to that Counter Position PCs message
store. The Transaction details shall simultaneously be automatically
replicated to all other Counter Position PCs in the Branch so that the data
are securely captured. In addition, Fujitsu Services shall automatically
replicate Transaction details to a remote server at which TMS is provided.

The OPS Counter Position PCs and TMS servers are known as "nodes".

All data and message transfers from a single node shall be generated in
a strict numbered sequence with a unique node identification. Any
attempt to introduce a fraudulent message shall be automatically
detected and rejected by OPS.

An additional pseudo random sequence number produced from a
cryptographic algorithm can also be included to provide a very high level
of message integrity as agreed between the Parties from time to time,
such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld. Details of the use of
the cryptographic algorithm are contained in the CCD entitled “HNG-X
Technical Security Architecture” (ARC/SEC/ARC/0003) (formerly
“Security Functional Specification” (RS/FSP/001)).

Data and message transfers shall be resilient to either network or node
failure. When the failure condition is resolved the nodes shall
automatically synchronise and complete any data or message transfers
that are required to ensure these nodes are in a consistent state.

Data Integrity

6.2.3.1

6.2.3.2

6.2.3.3

6.2.3.4

6.2.3.5

Fujitsu Services shall use techniques to ensure data integrity within the
OPS and as part of data/message transfer between OPS and TMS,
including:

(a) cyclic redundancy checks shall be calculated for all journal
records, including Reference Data;

(b) digital signatures shall be used for all data where assurance of
content and source are required; and

(c) data encryption shall be used selectively on certain data fields.

All messages and data shall have a cyclic redundancy check applied
when they are initially committed to the journal and this shall be checked
every time the message or data is accessed. This shall protect against
accidental corruption and casual tampering. Any failure of a cyclic
redundancy check shall cause the message to be rejected and retrieved
from alternate nodes.

In the event that nodes fail, recovery shall take place through the use of
the following techniques: associating of Post Office and correspondence
server nodes, message numbering, marker (message high and low water
marks) exchange message transfers to equalise water marks, and in
accordance with the CCD entitled “Post Office Site Failure Contingency
Procedures”.

Where Post Office requires the origin of data to be authenticated, Fujitsu
Services shall apply a digital signature to the data prior to transmission
and shall then check it upon receipt. Digital signature techniques and the
data to which they are applied shall be described in the CCD entitled
“HNG-X Technical Security Architecture’ (ARC/SEC/ARC/0003)
(formerly “Security Functional Specification” (RS/FSP/001)).

Fujitsu Services shall automatically detect any attempt to alter data and
shall log such attempts for subsequent investigation by Fujitsu Services.
Details of all such attempts shall be passed to Post Office.

Recovery

6.2.4.1

6.2.4.2

Fujitsu Services shall perform general recovery processes as specified
in the CCD entitled “HNG-X Business Continuity Framework”
(SVM/SDM/SIP/0001) (formerly “Business Continuity Framework”
(CS/SIP/002)).

The Counter Position PC in all single Counter Position Branches shall be
fitted with a second hard disk which shall be exchangeable to facilitate

Schedule B4.3 Version 13.0

The Data Centres (including NBS elements) will be configured such that no single point
of failure within the Data Centres will cause the NBS to fail with both Data Centres in
operation.

Switchover to backup systems within the Data Centres and for the network connections
within the Data Centres:

7.3.1 for real-time elements of the NBS affecting Banking Transactions at Counter
Positions shall be automated with the exception of the persistent store which shall
be manually switched over; and

7.3.2 for non-real time elements may be automated or manual.

The Central Network

7.4.1. The loss of a major switching node within the Central Network shall not cause the

NBS to fail and should such loss occur Fujitsu Services (in addition to its other
obligations under this Agreement) shall use all reasonable endeavours to procure
