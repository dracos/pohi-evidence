Alasdair, thanks it won't be easy. And re LL, yes of course - that is why I have asked Martin E to re-write what
we will now do. I should have that for Monday and will circulate for yours, Alice's and Alwen's input. We could
then arrange a call, or pick up some time around the ARC. Will confirm on Monday.

Have copied Alice to keep her in the loop.

Enjoy the day - just off for a ride; John has been v patient!

Thanks Paula and I'll ponder further (nice day for a ride!).

Given the likely progress this week can I suggest you/Alice and grab 10 mins to close off the SS
review discussions and agree the way forward.

In the meanwhile I hope all goes ok with Susan on Monday.
Have a good weekend.
Alasdair
