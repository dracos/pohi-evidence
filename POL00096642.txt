Thx Neil. Really appreciate that.
And in the context of that... what was so rewarding in terms of that, is that I had a note from Paul re

the drop at neighbour trial this am. Completely unprompted by me or you therefore!
I have asked him to send to you and Alice. I shall brief the rest of the board in my next report.

Some of the Strat papers took some working but the teams are really up for learning. And that's a good
place to be. Any queries anytime.

Nice to have you back fit and well! Enjoy your weekend.

Paula - it's always a pleasure to see you - and it bears repeating that I
think you are doing a very good job and making strong progress on a wide
number of fronts.

I had a wander and saw Pauline and Kevin (very!) briefly, but not Martin or
Paul unfortunately.

Well done with James. Definitely good to keep control of that process.
Without wishing to clog your diary, half an hour spent with you from time to
time is always valuable for me.

I started reading the Strategy pack earlier. I thought it was really good.
I had a few thoughts that I may send over just to you and chris tomorrow.
Cheers

Neil

Neil, good to see you earlier.

I'm sure you know this but it bears repeating: I do get a lot out of a
session with you - gentle reminders of what's important are just that -
important! Thanks for taking the time.

Did you see Martin or Paul?

The meeting with James Arbuthnot went completely to plan. So well worth
insisting on it, and making the effort to go across.

He has agreed to our TOR and an individual rather than a blanket approach.
Plus, we will issue any press release if one goes out, with a supportive
comment from him.

Good to have your support.

Paula
