1.1 LIVE

Overall Summary

The release note carried forward from last week was completed and passed to OTT.

We retain a limited ability to accommodate wraps for the next couple of weeks. The
Wigan bootserver was apparently successfully rebuilt by OSD over the weekend to
include the fix for bootserver crashes that has been on the stocks for some months.
Although tests conducted on Saturday were successful some problems have been

reported on counters on Monday (17). We are supporting the investigation of these

problems

Detailed Progress

Tivoli

« Two release notes delivered for live
e NR1647, replaced last weeks NR1630 (Counter_Core_Immediate) because

OTT found a functionality problem during their testing

¢ NR1648A, a dummy fix to test the Cl4 keys on the Signing Server

¢ One release note is in progress for delivery next week. NR1653 is a re-release
of NR1560A to merge two Counter_Install and Counter_admin_cfg fixes.

e Support given to SMC and OTT.

Auto-Configuration

e Problems are still occurring on the Bootle bootserver after the EICON driver
update on 17" July. There is no conclusive evidence pointing to the driver itself.
We shall be attending a review of the problem in Bracknell next Monday. Issue
to programme —- see below

¢ PC0040904 was raised on the updated EICON drivers on the Gateway counters.
Blue screens are observed during the AutoConfig process of other counters in
the office. This does not require the Gateway to be swapped at the same time. A
new version of the driver has been received from EICON and tested for delivery
in Cl4. Issue to programme —- see below

configuration is incorrect has been shown to be correct and a document
produced of the corrections needed. Comments from Richard Laking and Simon
Fawkes are awaited.

Riposte

e Riposte Message Server 5.4 appears to be suffering in live from the same
problems with ‘handle’ leakage as Riposte 6.0.2. This issue is more fully
discussed in section 1.2.

Current Critical Problems
¢ Nothing to report

Issues

e The rate of failure on the Bootle bootserver has not improved as expected
following the upgrade of the EICON driver. The root cause of the problem is
uncertain and will be the subject of a major ‘drains up’ next week. In the
meanwhile the network will be amended to point to the Wigan bootserver
instead

« Anumber of counters are failing during the auto configuration process, ending
up with blue screens. These counters are LAN connected to the gateway. The
current process in implementation, of replacing the gateway box if this occurs, is
in error. Glenn Stephens has reviewed this with Satish Mistry. Notwithstanding a
further fix to the EICON driver software is required to overcome this problem.
CP2549 has been raised to cover as a Cl4 delivery. This is being incorporated
late into the Live Pilot handover from PIT

1.2 CSR+

Overall Summary

Two major critical issues arose during the week. The first — handles leaks in the
Riposte Message Server could ultimately threaten rollout if not resolved, in as much
as the number of handles required for the full estate may exceed the limit inside NT.
The present work round is to reload the Riposte Service on the Correspondence
servers. This may need to be done more than once a day, and this is being
investigated by the TDA, as is the headroom we have inside rollout. An urgent fix is
being sought from Escher, but it is likely that this will require significant testing
before going live. The problem was first found in Riposte 6.0.2 but it is also present
in live. This issue is hidden from the customer behind the dynamic index swap
problem for which a work around is available. This therefore is no longer a stopper
to the start of Live Pilot and a fix will be available from Escher during Live Pilot.

The second major problem is the failure to swap out slave counters in Cl4. At
present intermittent fault causes the Riposte service to hang. We are having
extreme difficulty in diagnosing the root cause of this issue. Tests to date have not
demonstrated the problem on SCO’s, gateways or counters migrated to Cl4.
Investigations of slave swaps has shown the problem occurring at a number of
different points in the process of copying the squirreled message store from the

neighbour to the slave. It has been demonstrated that the problem only arises when
TeamCrypto is present. Next step is to seek assistance first from SDU and then
from TeamCrypto themselves.

In other areas the wrapping of the new delta to the migration package went well and
it moved to BTC testing at the end of the week.

Testing made reasonable progress, but the build of the FTMS platforms is again
causing problems, with a mixed CI4/CI4R baseline delivered in error from PIT, and
issues in the secureNT base unresolved after a new release. There is going to be a
hit on the DIT for the first AP Client unless this can speedily be resolved.

The other hit being taken is in testing AutoConfiguration of the satellite solution, as
test resources are diverted into the resolution of the TeamCrypto issue. This is now
eating up the contingency in the plan.

Detailed Progress

Auto-Configuration
¢ Continued to work on CP2667 ACDB Server for the ‘OCMS interim solution’.
e Documentation rework to keep it in line with the evolving product continues.

Tivoli

e Revised baseline BO49 received Tuesday from PIT.

¢ This was added to the migration wrap and delivered to BTC testing on Friday.

e Support was given to BTC testing of the new package over the weekend.

« The two most severe PinICLs from the B048 package [blue screen on rollback
and mixed office after regression] appear to be fixed in this release.

e Richard Maybourn joined the team as a replacement for Nozrul Hussein

Audit Extraction and retrieval

« Work continued on correcting and updating all Audit documentation. A review
meeting for four documents was held on Wednesday and these are now being
resubmitted to PVCS as approved.

arisen. A decision is still awaited from TDA.

Network and System Management.

« PC0046474 failure to swap out a counter and PC0044463 Rollout sync failure
took most of the week. As a result diagnosed a possible TeamCrypto problem
where errors occur in copy a file. Critical risk to programme — see below

Maestro

¢ CI4 HOST schedule version 6.4.0.15.3 delivered in WP9359 clearing PC 0050985, and
50958

¢ CI4R DW schedule version 6.4.0.15.1 delivered in WP 9363 containing CP 2358.

¢ CI4R DW schedule version 6.4.0.15.2 delivered in WP 9444 clearing PC 0051135, 51130,
and 51072

¢ —PinICLs PC0050184, 51089, 49603, and 51294 were investigated but no change was
required.

Message Broadcast Development
e Nothing to report

Escher

e Index swapping issues noted in WING tests last week. Escher is preparing a fix.
In the meanwhile we are testing the work around to rebuild indices under
Maestro control on Sunday mornings. This seems to offer a stable way forward
for the beginning of Live Pilot. The fix will be intercepted as an ‘A’ fix.

e Aleak of NT memory ‘handles’ has been discovered in Riposte 6.0.2. On
investigation this appears to be present in Riposte 5.4 as well. The effect is that
with an increase in throughput of entries into the message store [due to
increasing size of the estate, coupled with the large amounts of Reference Data
being sent to the system in preparation for Cl4] we exceed an apparent NT limit
of 64K handles.

«In live this may be the root cause of a number of Correspondence Server
problems [PC0050830 and 50916 refer].

e It is not clear how much headroom there is in the live estate or when, through
increase in counter numbers in the rollout we reach the point where the system

will not run. Critical risk to programme - see below

Mobiles

¢ After last week’s embarrassment a unit was delivered to PON for hardware
testing and was passed. The tester noted the length of time it took to get
through POLO logon.

e We have now identified 35 mobile outlets that require Satellite Comms. Of these
4 are dual location. Issue to programme — see below

New Routers

« Next step is to decommission 34Mb lines; a CP is being prepared by Dave
Tanner. It is expected that we shall project manage the changes and early
planning for this is underway

TMS Contingency Site (3 Data centre/CS Upgrade)
¢ Nothing to report.

Satellites

e System test being delayed by on going work on Cl4 migration issues. The
physical link from INF1 to the satellite dish in FELO1 is now available. Issue to
programme - see below

System testing

e INF1 was handed to SPTS for upgrade to CI4L1 status at the end of the week.
Forecast completion is now 09/08.

¢ PinICL clearance made good progress with 13 closed in the week.

¢ Of4 ‘AA’ PinlCLs assigned to testing two depend on completion of Work
Requests by SPTS.

e The use of Mark O'Sullivan to assist in the diagnosis of the TeamCrypto related
issues has delayed start of Satellite testing.

e AC -B049 has been used to rollout Frame Relay gateway, and previously ‘non-
secure’ offices have now been successfully rolled out using this build.

¢ Maestro schedules 6.4.0.15.2 and .3 blitzed OK.

e FTMS - the new secureNT baseline has either not fixed, or introduced further
problems (PC0051264).

e No new problems were found during regression testing of Audit. HLTP now
amended for all known new AP Client links, whilst LLTS has been updated for
Mid-Kent, HCC, SCC, Knowsley, Girobank and YE

e System Management - retesting of PinICLs associated with CP2553 (CTX touch
screen) is now complete. Most work associated with diagnosis of PC0046474.

e Failover regression — no new issues found.

e Testing of index build problem for TDA completed OK and PC0050598 will be
closed.

¢ Testing Training Mode regression now 80% complete. PC0040293 fix failed and
returned to development.

e Message Broadcast regression testing completed. PinICL clearance in progress.

Current Critical Problems

¢ The problems in getting the squirreled message store mean that we cannot
successfully swap out a faulty counter in Cl4. The exact cause of this problem is
difficult to establish, although some interaction with TeamCrypto is clearly
involved. Testing to date has shown that the problem is intermittent, apparently
only affects slaves, and will happen only on new build counters [i.e. slave
counters migrated to Cl4 have not failed]. More tests in SIDU are planned with
the objective of producing a work around fix in the Live Pilot timescale that will
keep us inside the SLA, but which will not need a fix from TeamCrypto.

e The issue in live with handle leak can be addressed by reloading the Riposte
service on the Correspondence server. It is not clear whether this needs to be
done once, or more than once, per day. Gareth Jenkins will address this issue.
In the meanwhile Mark Jarosz will liase with Escher to establish the root cause
of the leak. TDA will also be tasked to establish precisely how many offices can
be handled before this becomes a stopper to rollout.

e Issues

¢ Hummingbird fix (version 7.0) on 1% September is well outside our delivery
timescales for an ‘A’ class PinICL, and the other contents of the release are
unclear. Issue raised with Hummingbird for a full description of the changes in

v7.0.

¢ Delays to start of satellite testing are now eating up all contingency in plan

e We have previously worked on the assumption that no mobile offices would
need satellite comms. This has now proved to be false. No solution is currently
available for these offices and a new CP may be required.

« Work requests are outstanding with SPTS that must be completed before we
can start clearing AA PinlCLs.
