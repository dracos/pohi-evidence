Programme Delivery Authority Programme Initiation Document

1. INTRODUCTION

1.1. Purpose of this PID

1.1.1. At the Programme Board meeting of 13th May 1996 the Board mandated that
PRINCE (PRojects IN a Controlled Environment) was to be adopted as the
Programme Delivery Authority’s (PDA) project management standard. An initiation
document is a fundamental element of the PRINCE methodology. It is therefore a
prerequisite to any deployment of the methodology.

1.1.2, The Programme Initiation Document (PID) provides a baseline statement reflecting
at a high level the :

. background, scope and boundaries of the PDA;

. aims and objectives of the PDA;

. high level deliverables (products);

. descriptions of key PDA roles with associated areas of responsibility;

. statements of the management structures and Programme operational model.

1.1.3. In essence a PID provides high level management direction to enable detailed
development of day to day working practices.

1.2. Background

1.2.1. In August 1993 a joint Benefits Agency (BA) and Post Office Counters Ltd (POCL)
Development Group was established to explore alternatives to the current system of
order books and girocheques for paying Social Security benefits through post office
outlets. Senior management in BA and POCL and the Secretaries of State for DSS
and DTI accepted the recommendation for a card based system, and it was
subsequently decided to pursue the project under the Government’s Private Finance
Initiative (PFI).

Programme Delivery Authority Programme Initiation Document

1.2.2.

1.2.3.

1.2.4.

The procurement process, managed by a joint BA/POCL Programme, began in
August 1994 with the placement of a notice in the Official Journal of the European
Community (OJEC). This was followed by:

. the issue of the Statement of Service Requirements (SSR) in March 1996;

. the evaluation of the responses to the SSR that produced a shortlist of three
suppliers;

. a full evaluation process which led to the award of contracts for “Information
Technology Services Agreement for Bringing Technology to Post Offices and
Benefit Payments” by the Department of Social Security (DSS) and POCL to
ICL Pathway on 15 May 1996.

In parallel with the PFI procurement, BA has been developing a number of systems
as part of its Customer Accounting and Payments Strategy (CAPS) which forms a
key part of the DSS’s overall IS/IT strategy. Version 1 of CAPS is being developed
to support, among other things, the introduction of card payments.

Following the award of the PFI contract, it was necessary to move rapidly from a
procurement programme into an implementation programme. To this end, the PDA
was established to achieve successful implementation and to liaise with ICL Pathway
and other linked systems e.g. CAPS and Transaction Information Processing (TIP) in
order to ensure that essential dependencies are recognised and delivered to the
required timescales.

2. PROGRAMME DEFINITION
21. Programme Objectives
Overall Objectives.

2.1.1. The PDA has a number of joint high level objectives. The overall service objectives

are:

to deliver a fraud-free method of paying benefits at post offices;
to develop a system that meets recognised accountancy practices;

for automation to provide greater commercial opportunities enabling POCL to
improve competitiveness and increase efficiency;

to provide an improved level of service to all customers.

2.1.2. In addition to the above there are a number of objectives specific to each partner,
these are:

Benefits Agency Objectives

to modernise benefit payments - the present system has been in place for some
40 years and is becoming increasingly unsatisfactory;

to deliver a more secure system - tackling fraud and abuse is a high priority to
cut down a large proportion of the £150 million lost in this way each year;

to provide an efficient customer service which is acceptable and understood;
to phase out order books and girocheques;

to provide a more cost effective method of payment - the present paper-based
methods of payment are comparatively expensive. The cost of order books,
girocheques, printing, postage and staff time spent handling them adds up to

considerably more than electronic transfer of funds;

to provide full accounting and reconciliation facilities.

Post Office Objectives
. to enable new business - new technology that can be applied in other areas will
be of benefit to both the organisation and customers alike; J

. to exploit the opportunities to achieve the businesses number one strategic
priority of automation of all offices;

. to achieve a long term relationship with their largest client - BA;
. to cut down on paperwork and back office processing;

. to provide an improved service to customers.

2.2, Programme Purpose

2.2.1. The PDA will be in place until the conclusion of post office infrastructure and benefit
’ payment card roll-out, although its role will be reviewed in the light of progress on
implementation at the end of 1997.

2.2.2. _ Its mission will be to ensure the development, delivery, implementation and rollout
of all the products and services needed to achieve the currently defined joint
objectives of the Programme and so to assist BA and POCL achieve the business
benefits defined in each organisation’s business case.

2.2.3. The PDA will take the scope of the Programme as being that set by the Joint
Objectives and the Sponsors’ business cases,

for the implementation of an overall business solution which meets the User
Requirements which have been specified by Sponsors in the BA/POCL Requirements [
Catalogue (see Appendix A).

2.2.4. The PDA will be responsible for facilitating and integrating the activities necessary I

administered from within the PDA for the duration of the implementation phase. The
Sponsors may second relevant experts to PDA to help with this if they wish (not least
to ensure continuity at the end of the implementation phase), but if so they will come
under functional line management of the PDA. The PDA will not be a legal entity
and its contract management and administration will be performed on behalf of the -
BA Accounting Officer and the POCL Managing Director.

2.2.5. The contracts with ICL Pathway, although owned by the Sponsors, will be [

©
2.2.6. The PDA will develop and own the PDA Master Plan and have the authority to make I -
any changes to it that may be necessary to maximise business benefits or minimise [
the negative effects of deviations from plan or external events. Any changes can only
be made after consultation with affected parties in the Sponsor organisations.
Following the endorsement of the Plan by the Steering Committee the PDA will
arrange delivery of the Plan by commissioning deliverables from ICL Pathway, from
Sponsor organisations, from other projects (such as CAPS and TIP) and internally to
agreed cost, quality, specification and delivery date. The PDA will track progress

against the PDA Master Plan and Quality Assure it for, and progress of, the
production of deliverables. The PDA will also control dependencies and manage the
linkages between different deliverable groups.

2.2.7. _ The PDA will manage the End-to-end Design Authority which will own and control
the specifications and service levels on the various service boundaries, including
those with CAPS and TIP and (at a technical and operational level) other POCL
clients’ systems. It will specify the requirements for, organise and commission the
production of, and approve, relevant business processes, data migration policies and
management and service information. Within the overall Programme objectives it
will determine trade-offs between customer acceptability and security of the card
scheme, consulting with Chief Executives and Ministers where necessary.

2.2.8. The PDA will ensure that all ongoing responsibilities are identified as the Programme
develops and that plans are established for their transfer to “Business as Usual”
owners in the sponsor organisations when the activities of the PDA are due to
terminate.

2.2.9. The PDA will have overall responsibility for the design and development of the
benefit payment scheme end-to-end, and will by specification and approval ensure
the alignment, consistency and security of all business processes involved. The PDA
will establish and operate the Security Authority during the development,
implementation and rollout period.

2.2.10. The PDA will have an oversight of all the relevant costs and savings lines. There
will be an overall provision for Departure From Estimate (DFE), both for
implementation costs themselves and for steady state costs. The PDA will control
the DFE provision, allocating it as appropriate to maximise achievement.

2.2.11. The PDA will have overall authority on behalf of the Chief Executives of the BA and
Social Security Agency (SSA), and the Managing Director of POCL to:

. manage the resolution of conflicting requirements, including timetable and
escalation management;

. ensure sufficient quantity and quality of resources are available;
. determine Programme priorities and resolve conflicts of demands for resources;

° accept deliverables from the Supplier on behalf of BA and POCL and accept
deliverables from Sponsors and from related projects (e.g. CAPS and TIP);

. agree variations to Supplier solutions, within the bounds of the requirements
and the business cases;

° provide a change control mechanism;

. ensure that all parties meet their responsibilities within the Programme,
including Sponsor actions;

. ensure that the Programme gains maximum value for money from ICL
Pathway;

. manage the relationship with ICL Pathway in the development and
implementation of the User Requirements (but not the Business Partnership
relationship with POCL, which will be handled directly with POCL Markets

Directors);

. promote a constructive and business-like relationship among all the parties
involved in the Programme;

. ensure that Sponsors are managing the realisation of business benefits;
. monitor the performance of ICL Pathway during the rollout period;

. escalate issues for resolution by the BA and SSA Chief Executives and the
POCL Managing Director;

. align plans and report progress against them to the BA and SSA Chicf
Executives and POCL Managing Director.

2.2.12. The PDA will have overall management of communications about the Programme,
both internally, with customers, and with other interested parties (e.g. Members of
Parliament and Special Interest Groups).

2.2.13. By the end of the Programme the PDA will deliver to the Sponsors (the timing of
handover for each item to be reviewed at the end of 1997):

. a (tri-partite) steady state Security Authority;

° a steady state Design Authority;

. a stable set of contracts and contract management arrangements for the
Sponsors to carry forward as they see fit (which may or may not include a
continuing co-ordinating role in contract management);

. testing facilities and procedures to carry through future changes to their
systems;

° service level monitoring group or groups, to be agreed with the Sponsors;

° documentation, procedures and change control processes to allow the steady-
state management of the end-to-end service.

2.3. Dependencies and Risks

2.3.1. The major dependencies between parties are identified as Key Deliverables and
Intermediate Milestones in Appendices B and C of the PDA Master Plan.

2.3.2. Risks and their current status are held by the Planning and Performance Team.

3. PROGRAMME ORGANISATION

3.1. The Approach

3.1.1. To support the delivery and direct assurance phase of the Programme the PDA will
adopt a matrix management approach aligned to a PRINCE2 organisational structure.
This enables the PDA to be viewed from two directions, a functional model and an
operational model (see the diagram overleaf PDAORG1).

3.1.2. The functional model structures the PDA on formal reporting lines to facilitate
effective line management. The diagram shows examples of strands of activity led
by the PMT members or strand managers, and the reporting line to team leaders and
thus on to team members.

3.1.3. The operational model is geared more towards the co-ordination of product delivery
and acceptance. PDAORG1 shows the links between Stage Managers, the PMT and
the management matrix.

3.1.4. The other key roles of the Programme Steering Committee (PSC), the PDA Board,
the Programme Director, the PDA Management Team (PMT) and the Programme
Assurance Team are described in more detail in this section.

3.1.5. Detailed information on the working principles of this organisational model are held
by the PDA’s Processes Team. Impacts on individuals and their responsibilities will
be captured within the individuals job descriptions.

3.2. Programme Steering Committee

3.2.1. The PSC steers the strategic decision making process. It is primarily responsible for
the provision of direction and guidance to the Programme and it has ultimate
authority to monitor, review and ensure the successful completion of the Programme.

3.2.2. The PSC sets and may change the business boundaries, the scope of the Programme ,
the strategic milestones and the constraints within which they are to be progressed. It
monitors overall progress and resource usage in meeting the targets embodied in the
PDA Master Plan.

3.2.3. In circumstances where the overall strategy, its milestones or justification are
threatened, or when changes in policy appear to be necessary a PSC decision or
endorsement would be required.

3.2.4. Its main outputs can be summarised as follows:

e agreed business aims and objectives;

. endorsement of overall Programme plans;

. commitment of top management to resourcing;

. approval to proceed beyond major milestones;

. guidance on communications strategies and plans;

° agreed changes to business boundaries.

5. PROGRAMME PLANS AND PROGRESS REPORTING ARRANGEMENTS

5.1. Programme Plans

5.1.1. A strategic plan (the PDA Master Plan see Appendix A for details) has been
produced by the Planning & Performance Reporting Team and was endorsed by the
PDA board on 9 October 1996.

5.1.2. The plan has been structured with three principles in mind.

5.1.3. The first is that the work (and the thirty three strategic milestones identified for the
delivery of the plan) divide into the eight groups set out below:

(a)

(b)

@

©)

@®

(g)

(h)

Group A - IGL which summarises the intermediate milestones and activities
leading to the IGL strategic milestones (Al and A2).

Group B - Pilot which summarises the intermediate milestones and activities
leading to the Pilot strategic milestones (BI and B2).

Group C - Mainland post office (PO) roll-out which summarises the roll-out of
automation into offices; this is not (strictly) dependent on product development
(C1-C99).

Group D - NI PO and SSA benefit roll-out which summarises the roll-out of
automation into NI POs (D1-D99). In NI all offices are automated when the
products are delivered and the migration taken place over the period shown.
Milestones D4, D7 and D8 replicate the milestones E4, E6 and E7 respectively,
as they denote when these benefits become available within Northern Ireland.

Group E - BA benefit roll-out which summarises the delivery of BA benefits
with the key intermediate milestones, when defined (E1-E99).

Group F - POCL developments which covers the POCL AP migration and
settlement projects. (F1).

Group G - ICL Pathway releases which sets out the operational dates for ICL
Pathway releases 1 to 4 (G1-G4).

Group H - PDA Programme support which summarises the PDA support
activities (which will have sub-ordinate plans) leading to the ‘Programme
complete’ strategic milestone (H99) when all benefits can be paid electronically
and all POCL current products are re-engineered, as appropriate.

5.1.4. The second is that each activity on the PDA Master Plan shall be the responsibility of
a single person and be supported by a sub-ordinate plan (or plans). This will form
the process for ongoing management review and reporting.

5.1.5. The third is that for activities on the plan of more than three months duration, the
imminent intermediate milestones will be included for reporting purposes.

Programme Delivery Authority Programme Initiation Document

5.1.6. The PDA Master Plan is a dynamic document and will be subject to regular review
and update (consistent with agreed change control procedures) to reflect the
integrated commitments of all parties to deliver the Programme.

5.2. Progress Reporting Arrangements

5.2.1. The PDA Monthly Review and Reporting Process document outlines the PDA formal
monthly review and reporting process. These reviews will be corporate reviews and
will form the basis of the official control process on the Programme.

6. PRINCE PRODUCT ASSURANCE,

6.1. Introduction

6.1.1. The PRINCE Management Manual describes the controls and the means by which
quality can be planned and then assured throughout a project or programme of work.
This section of the PID provides a high level summary of how these procedures
should be applied in the development of PDA products. Details of the Quality
Review Process within the PDA are contained in a separate document (see Appendix
A). Product Assurance is concerned with ensuring that the required quality criteria
are built into a product during its development. It involves the examination and
review of products produced by the Programme and is realised by two main
procedures, Quality Review and, in system products, testing.

6.2. Products

6.2.1. Quality controls are directed at products. They ensure that products conform to a pre-
defined set of criteria and have been produced to agreed standards. In general terms,
each end-product in the PDA Master Plan will have a product description which

details:
. the products purpose;
. its composition;
. the product derivation and any external dependencies;
. the quality criteria that must be met; and
. how the criteria will be measured.

6.2.2. A product is not complete until it has been submitted for Quality Review, and the
review team has confirmed that it meets the specification and quality criteria.

6.3. Criteria

6.3.1, I The range and priority of quality criteria may be difficult to establish but it is
important that they address the main business, user and specialist interests in
determining the acceptance of products. To be effective, the criteria must be
measurable and should include items such as timescale, cost, functionality,
performance, user friendliness and ease of maintenance.

6.4, Quality Review
What Is It?
6.4.1. A procedure whereby a product is checked against an agreed set of quality criteria.

Programme Delivery Authority Programme Initiation Document

What are the Basic Principles?

6.4.2. A well structured Quality Review process should possess the following:
. an organised approach with clear instructions;
. unambiguous and objective quality criteria;

. clearly defined roles;

Fee een oe ee

. a “Team Approach”.

Objectives

—_

6.4.3. The objectives are:

. to assure that a product meets business, user and specialist requirements;

. assessing the conformity of a product against set criteria; c

. providing a platform for product improvement; of

. involving all who have a vested interest in the product; .

. sharing ownership of the product; -

. obtaining commitment from all with a vested interest; - é

° providing a mechanism for management control. 7 .

Roles and Responsibilities « j
6.4.4. These are set out in the paper “Quality Review Process and Principles within the ~ j

PDA”. The following roles are described: ad

° Product Author;

. Product Co-ordinator;

. Domain Assurance Person;

° Programme Assurance Team;

. Library Support Service;

. Review Chairman;
. Reviewers;
. Scribe.

Timescale

6.4.5. A Quality Review is in three parts - the preparation, the review mecting itself and the
follow up. The paper referred to in the paragraph above allows for informal reviews
of products, but the basic three parts described above remain the same.

Further Information

6.4.6. The Quality Review process within the PDA is described in a paper of that name,
which is held in the library.

6.5. Implementation of PRINCE in the PDA

6.5.1. It has been agreed that a PRINCE2 framework, that is by its nature, non-bureaucratic,
should be implemented within the PDA. An expeditious implementation approach is
to be adopted. The objective of this approach is to train key players in PRINCE
skills and have the requisite processes and product ownership responsibilities in place
by the end of February 1997.

RISKS, MANAGEMENT OF CHANGE & AUTHORITIES’
RESPONSIBILITIES

Key Business Risks

Under the terms of the Government’s PFI the major element of risk for the delivery
of the Programme is vested with the service provider - ICL Pathway - and this is
reflected in the contractual arrangements signed between ICL Pathway, the DSS and
POCL. However, the Programme is complex, and is dependent on the delivery of a
number of feeder projects (the CAPS programme within the DSS and the TIP and
Reference Data projects within POCL), and the timely fulfilment of Authorities’
Responsibilities, as well as on the delivery of contracted services by ICL Pathway.

Risk analysis within the PDA needs to identify and quantify the exposure of the
Programme to:

. failure by the service provider to deliver systems, functionality and procedures
to the agreed scope, timescale or quality;

. failure by feeder projects to deliver interfacing systems, functionality and
procedures to the agreed timescale or quality;

° failure by the Contracting Authorities to deliver contractual responsibilities to
the agreed timescales or quality;

. external factors which would inhibit the achievement of the Programme’s
objectives.

Risk management within the PDA will provide the following functions:
. prioritise risks according to their materiality and urgency;

. identify which risks need to be actively managed and set the responsibility for
their management;

. identify countermeasures to reduce or eliminate the risk and conduct impact
analysis on the available options;

. agree the appropriate options and, as necessary, incorporate them into
Programme plans;

. monitor and update the risk assessment and suitability of countermeasures at
appropriate intervals;

The risk management process is controlled and co-ordinated by the Planning &

Performance Reporting Manager, who is also responsible for the maintenance of the
Programme risk register.

Management Of Change

It is recognised that the effective management of change will be of critical
importance in this Programme.

Prior to the Award of Contract a mechanism for escalating significant changes was
agreed to by the sponsors and the bidders and this is known as the Charterhouse
Mechanism.

Subsequent to the award of contract the PDA has undertaken work to determine the
Change Control Process for changes to the contract and baseline documents. This
process has been documented in “Change Control Procedures” (see Appendix A) and
a Change Controller has been appointed.

Other changes that only impact the PDA. will be managed within the PRINCE
methodology management processes. These are described within the CCTA
PRINCE reference material. Adherence to these processes will ensure the production
of an audit trail for small scale changes.

Authorities’ Responsibilities

Contracting Authorities’ Responsibilities (CARs) are deliverables required of the
Contracting Authorities (BA, SSA & POCL) by ICL Pathway. At the time of writing
there were approximately 1,500 CARs, over 600 of which were contractually
specified by ICL Pathway. Failure by the PDA to ensure a CAR is fulfilled could put
the Contracting Authorities in breach of contract.

CARs have been allocated to controlling officers in the PDA and delivery officers in
both the PDA and the Contracting Authorities. The PDA is now brokering the
agreement of a definitive list of product deliverables and timescales with ICL
Pathway and the Contracting Authorities.
