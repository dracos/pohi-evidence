Please pass this email directly to Mr Cameron. Thank you.
Dear Mr Cameron,

As yet I have received no response to my below-copied email to Mr Freeman. In it, Iam
challenging the words he used in the House in summarising my firm's Reports on the Post Office
and its Horizon operating platform. In that you also incorrectly used similar words in the House,
I respectfully look to you to ensure that more care is taken on this matter so that broad
reassurances are not again mistakenly given.

Subject: Second Sight's Briefing Report - Part Two
Sensitivity: Private

Dear Mr Freeman:

I am puzzled, and not a little distressed, by your summarisation, in your recent email to Mr Ian
Warren, and more importantly in Parliament, of my firm's Interim and Part Two Reports (there
were, in fact, three Reports). You have summarised our Reports with the following words:
"Second Sight have produced two independent reports, in 2013 and 2015, both of which
demonstrate that there is no evidence of systemic flaws within the Horizon system which could
cause the issues reported". That is NOT a correct statement. I respectfully draw your attention
to paragraphs 21.27 and 26.8 of our Report, and to the following additional paragraphs:

9.3; 9.6; 9.12; 10.10; 11.8; 13.8; 21.3; 21.4; 21.8; 21.30; 21.31; and 22.10.

You may have noted, from reading our Reports, and also from Post Office's Rebuttal Documents,
that Post Office has continually focussed attention on the system itself (i.e. Horizon’, and its
successor system, Horizon Online’), and even more narrowly on the software, rather than on the
entirety of the operational platform used by its Subpostmasters. It follows that even if there had
never been any systemic flaws in either version of the system (that being a contention with which
we do not agree), that would not mean that the operational platform as a whole was always fit for
purpose for all of the tens of thousands of users. As we have stated in our Report, it was not.

I have attached here a copy of our Briefing Report - Part Two. In that copies of this Report are
JARBOO000116
JARBO000116

already in the public domain, releasing a further copy to you does not constitute a breach of our
Confidentiality Agreement.

I am available at any time, subject to the constraints imposed (by our Confidentiality Agreements
with Post Office) on my firm, myself and on my colleagues individually, should you call for any
clarification.

With best regards,
