[Start of Response]

there has been no report to me from the Prosecution Team about this issue and so it is most likely that the ARQ they were running
failed and when they reran it it succeeded. The errors logged are always put into the close log of the ARQ when the ARQ is
closed. I have had a look at all recent closed ARQ logs and this is a fairly common error. In fact 4% of ARQs looked at (out of
1503) had failed.

7:22 User:Gerald Barnes

so in conclusion it happens but the ARQs almost certainly work on rerun since otherwise the prosecution team would have raised a
PEAK themselves.

I got the incident described in "Date:12-Feb-2019 15:42:04 User: Customer Call_

in development.
jt just ran an audit query to return some files and it happened.

I reran the query from a clean start and it did not.

so it is an intermittent problem which does not occur consistently.
