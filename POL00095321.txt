Introduction

Caution and Interview

‘The Caution and Interview go hand in hand and are key areas for
Post Office Security Managers. Any interview with a suspected
offender will only be admissible in a subsequent prosecution if it has
been conducted in accordance with the Police and Criminal Evidence
Act 1984 (PACE) Codes of Practice. This will include the need for a
suspected offender to be correctly cautioned and informed of their
legal rights.

‘This module focuses on all aspects of the caution including:

+ the actual wording which must be used:

+ when a caution is appropriate:

+ how to respond if questions are asked about the meaning of
the caution,

‘The module goes on to deal with interviews including:

+ details of the equipment used in tape-recorded interviews

+ how to conduct the interview;

«how to respond to many of the difficult situations that can arise
during an interview.

‘Throughout this module a recurring theme will be the need to comply
with the PACE Codes of Practice. Although there is a separate
module on these Codes of Practice, they also form a very important
part of the subject matter of this module,

‘The correct use of the caution is one of the key areas of a

Security Manager's role, and the importance of a thorough
understanding of this subject cannot be over emphasised.

This section focuses on the caution you, as a Security Manager,
may need to use in the course of your duties. It looks at the wording
‘which must be used, when a caution is appropriate, and the second
caution that is used at the end of an interview.

Why is there a Caution?

It is basic principle of the law in this country that no one can be
forced to either:

+ incriminate themselves;

+ of answer questions.
‘The caution is the means of explaining those rights.
Nhat wording is used in the Caution

‘The following words must be used each and every time a caution
is given:

“You do not have to say anything, but it may harm your
defence if you do not mention when questioned something
which you later rely on in court. Anything you do say may
be given in evidence. Do you understand?”

‘The caution is shown in PACE Codes of Practice ~ Code C 10.4.

When to Caution

‘There are four criteria laid down, all of which must be met before a
caution should be given, These are:

1. You must have reasonable grounds to suspect that a criminal
offence has been committed.

2. You must have grounds to suspect the person concemed of
committing that offence.

3. You must be intending to put questions to that person regarding
his involvement in that offence,

4, The possibility must exist that any replies given by the person
(or the fact that they remained silent) may be given to a Court
in a prosecution.

‘The criteria for when to caution are described in PACE Codes of
Practice — Code C 10.1. Locate and read this reference now.

The Criteria Examined
Let us now examine some of the criteria in more detail.

criteria 2

“You must have grounds to suspect the person concerned
of committing that offence.”

By “grounds to suspect” we mean something more than merely a hunch
or simple suspicion, There must be clear reasons based on facts, not just
a feeling that the person is involved. To put it another way, “grounds to '
suspect” indicates that there is some objective basis for the suspicion

that a particular individual has committed the offence being investigated.

“The possibility must exist that any replies given by the
person (or the fact that they remained silent) may be given
to a Court in a prosecution.”

tis important to note that when you are asking questions, without
the intention of using them for a prosecution, you do not need to
caution the person,

‘The PACE Codes of Practice - Code C 10.1 ~ gives some examples
of questions that may be asked without issuing a caution. Locate and
read this reference now.

‘You would have noticed that these include any questions asked to
establish:

+ identity;
+ ownership of a vehicle:

+ need to search (this is detailed further in the Powers of Search
Module).

Additionally, even when you are asking questions to establish
whether, or by whom, an offence has been committed, you do not
need t0 caution until you:

+ have grounds to suspect a particular individual;
+ wish to question them to obtain evidence to put before a Court.

Generally speaking, Post Office Security Managers will not be
involved with asking questions about identity and ownership of
vehicles; these aspects apply more to Police Officers. However,
it is important to be fully aware of the criteria for when a caution
should be issued with the “grounds to suspect” criteria being

In this case:

+ You are intending to put questions to them about the offences.

+ You would NOT, at this stage, plan to use either their replies, or the

None of the PHGs should be cautioned before being interviewed,
as not all four of the criteria have been met. However, if during
‘questioning the position changed, for example, if someone made
admissions, they should immediately be cautioned. As soon as the
admissions were made, the four criteria would have been met.

The Caution

incorrect Wording

‘On the last page the recommendation was made to keep practising
the caution until you are word perfect. What happens, though, if you
do use wording which is not exactly as shown?

‘Minor deviations from the prescribed wording do not constitute a
breach of the Codes of Practice provided that the sense of the caution
is preserved.

‘The PACE Codes of Practice — Code C 10.4 ~ gives some guidance
on this aspect. Locate and read this reference now.

Why dogs the Wording Matter?

‘The wording is crucial because, as said in the Introduction to this
module, evidence of admissions can be ruled inadmissible if it was
not obtained properly. The Judge might take the view that a badly-
worded caution did not get the meaning over properly, and therefore
resultant admissions should not be allowed as evidence, with the case
possibly being lost as a result.

Examples of Acc

table

Here are examples of what would probably be regarded as acceptable
and not acceptable as variations of the correct wording of the
caution.

“You are not obliged to say anything but it may harm your
defence if you fail to tell me something when I ask you
questions which you later rely on in court. Anything you do
say could possibly be given in evidence.”

‘You will see that all the important phrases of the caution have been
included, with just minor variations in the wording. It is therefore
highly unlikely that any criticism could be made in Court of the
‘wording used.

Caution

“You do not have to say anything but what you say may be
given in evidence.”

‘It will be seen that a significant part of the caution has been omitted
in this example, and it could quite fairly be argued that the person
being cautioned did not receive a fair description of their rights.

More Detailed Explanatior

‘What if someone says they do not understand the meaning of the
caution?

‘The PACE Codes of Practice ~ Code C Notes for Guidance 10C —
gives some guidance for when this type of situation arises. Locate
and read this reference now.

‘The key points to explain are that the person does not have to say
anything and can remain silent. However, if they are prosecuted and
in Court give an explanation that they could have mentioned at
the time they were questioned, the Court may not consider the
explanation has much credibil

‘The wording of this further explanation could therefore be:

“You have the right to say absolutely nothing. However, if
‘you are taken to Court and you then say something in your
defence to explain your actions, and claim you are innocent,
the Court may draw its own conclusions if you have not
‘mentioned it when questioned. They might think you are only
saying it in Court because you have had time to think of what
10 say, whereas if you do have an explanation you should
mention it when I question you. Anything you do say may be
given in evidence.”

If there is any doubt in your mind about the person’s full understanding
‘of the caution itis vital to explain it in sufficient detail for it to be shown

Second Caution

‘There is also a second caution which we will refer to now even
though it is used towards the end of an interview. If you have
sufficient evidence to support a prosecution, you inform the suspected
offender that they may have rendered themselves liable to
prosecution, and administer the second caution. The wording is:

“You do not have to say anything, but it may harm your
defence if you do not mention now something which you
later rely on in court. Anything you do say may be given in
evidence. Do you understand?”

‘There will be further information on this aspect later in the module
regarding interviews.

‘This caution is also used if someone is charged at a Police Station,
and it will be seen that the key word changed is “...if you do not,
‘mention now something which...”

‘The criterion for issuing this caution during an interview is the
existence of what you consider sufficient evidence to support a
prosecution. It is not necessary for admissions to have been made.

mention it when I question you. Anything you do say may be
given in evidence,

Caution and Interview

This section looks at the interview stage of an investigation. It aims
to explain the process you need to follow to ensure that the evidence
you obtain at an interview is in fine with the PACE Codes of
Practice.

vhat is an Intervi

An interview is the questioning of a person regarding their
involvement (or suspected involvement) in a criminal offence or
offences which, by virtue of the PACE Codes of Practice (paragraph
10.1 of Code C), is required to be carried out under caution.

‘The PACE Codes of Practice - Code C Section 11.1 A ~ refers to this
definition. Locate and read this reference now.

However, there is a separate Code which deals with the procedures
involved when tape recording interviews. This is Code E, and we
shall look at this in more detail in the next section of this workbook.

lease read the PACE Codes of Practice - Code C Section 11.
‘The four pages of this section cover a lot of the general principles
of interviewing prior to the tape-recording procedures which are
covered in Code E.

Although the definition of an interview shown above is quite clear, it

is necessary to stress that the word “interview” is to be given a wide,
rather than a narrow, interpretation,

Interview

Rules Rela

‘There was a Court of Appeal case of “Matthews, Dennison and Voss”
where the following ruling was made:

* Any discussion or talk between a suspect or prisoner and a Police
Officer would amount to an interview, whether instigated by the
suspect or the Police Officer.

Other Court of Appeal cases over the years have laid down the
following principles:

+ The fact that the exchange consisted merely of a “quick chat” does
not prevent it being an interview.

+ Where an Officer asks a question which produces an incriminating
response the exchange can be an interview, even though the Officer
hhad no real grounds for suspicion when he put the question.

+ The fact that the exchange takes place in the street or at the scene
of a crime does not prevent it being an interview.

* The fact that the questions put by the Officer are designed to give
the arrested person or suspect an opportunity to give an innocent
explanation (as opposed to eliciting admissions) does not prevent
the exchange being an interview.

* The fact that the suspect has asked for the interview to be “off the
record” does not prevent it being an interview. The Code does not,
allow for “off the record” conversation, even in the form of a
general chat, though if the suspect is not warned of this, a resulting
admission may be excluded on the grounds that its admission would
bbe unfair,

All references in PACE to Police Officers apply to other people
involved in investigative work, such as Post Office Security
‘Managers. Section 67 para 9 of PACE states “that persons other than
Police Officers who are charged with the duty of investigating
offences or charging offenders shall in discharge of that duty have
regard to any relevant provision of such a code”.

‘What the above Court of Appeal ruling means is that interviews have
to be conducted on a formal basis following the correct procedures.
The days of “The Sweeney”, with cosy Tittle chats as a means of
obtaining admissions are over!

Interviews must always be conducted strictly in accordance with the
PACE Codes of Practice.

‘There are, however, also some disadvantages, namely:

Even if you have not seen a Post Office interview being recorded,
you will probably have seen “The Bill” on television, and have some
idea of what the equipment looks like. In any event, during the
Practical Skills Course classroom sessions, further training will be
given on this subject, including practical exercises.

‘The standard equipment is supplied by “NEAL”. Here is some
‘general information about the equipment we use:

+ Two standard cassettes are used. Post Office tapes last 45 minutes,
but most Police tapes are only 30 minutes duration.

+ The machine records both tapes simultaneously.

+The machine has a counter which records in minutes.

+ The machine has red and green lights which react to the sounds of
the talking.

+The microphone is sensitive, and where it is placed is therefore a
consideration,

{In addition to the above, other equipment is required to complete the
interviewing task, for example:

+ Tape copier — this is a machine which copies tapes at high speed
‘when extra copies are required. However, some Police Stations now
use tape-recording machines with three tapes thereby automatically
providing a spare copy.

+ Playback machine ~ this is a machine whereby you can play back
one of the two tapes when a summary or transcript is being
prepared. ‘

Section 4: Miscellaneous

Caution and Interview

This final section looks again at the PEACE process, and also
considers the distribution of the tapes at the end of an interview.

“PEACE” Proce

88

Earlier in the module we looked at the Planning and Preparation
stage of the “PEACE” process. We now look at the remaining parts.

Engage and Explain

‘The “engage” stage is the initial introduction and subsequent
explanation of what is to happen during the interview. They are very
important areas, and all interviews have to start somewhere. The first
impression given by the interviewer is critical - common courtesy is,
the key and is likely to result in a far more successful interview.

‘The “explain” stage is concerned with the information given to the
interviewee in order that the purpose and direction of the interview
can be fully understood. This would include the reasons for the
interview, the routine it wil follow and the basic outline of the
interview.

Account

This is the stage where you deal with the interviewee’s recollection
of the events, and is the time when questions are asked. There are
different methods of questioning called the “Cognitive” approach and
the “Management of Conversation”. These will be discussed in more
detail in the Practical Skills Course, along with practical exercises.

THIRTY THREE
Section 4: I

Caution and Interview

tis important to close an interview properly, and amongst the points,
to consider are:

+ to summarise what has been said;
+ to check your understanding of what has been said;
+ to invite questions or feedback.

‘The final part of the interview is the evaluation, where you refer
back to your objectives from the planning stage and see if they have
been met.

It is appreciated that the above explanation of questioning techniques
seems very formal and complicated. No amount of theory can take
the place of practical interviewing experience, and any concerns you
have about this matter will be addressed in great detail during the
exercises on the Practical Skills Course.

Every Security Manager has to conduct their first interview
sometime, and it will be a less daunting prospect after your practise
sessions!

‘The security of the two tapes is of prime importance, and this is fully
covered in both the PACE Codes of Practice Code E, and the Quick
Reference Guide to Tape-Recorded Interviews.

In simple terms, one tape is sealed and becomes the Master Tape.
‘The seal has to be signed by all parties before the interview has
concluded. The Master Tape is retained as an exhibit for any
prosecution

‘The second copy becomes the working tape and is used for preparing

tape summaries or transcripts. It can also be copied if additional
copies are required.

READING

Interview

‘This module focused on how to caution and interview suspects in
accordance with PACE.

In Section 1 we looked at the caution, which you as a Security
Manager will need to give in the course of your duties. We looked at
the exact wording required when issuing the caution, when the
caution is appropriate and acceptable variations to the official
wording of the caution, The section finished by looking at the second
caution issued at the end of an interview.

Section 2 focused on the interview stage of the investigation.
We looked at the definition of an interview and the rules which
need to be followed at all times.

Section 3 explored how tape-recorded interviews need to be
administered. We looked briefly atthe advantages and disadvantages
of tape recording.

Finally, Section 4 explored some of the general matters you will get
involved in when conducting interviews. We looked at conducting a
structured interview, and the distribution of tapes following a tape-
recorded interview.

‘There is no specific follow-up reading recommended with this
‘module, However, the importance of understanding the PACE
Codes of Practice C and B and the Quick Reference Guide for
‘Tape Recorded Interviews cannot be over stated

‘There are a lot of procedures and legal matters referred to in these
documents, and it is recommended that you plan time to read them
again to consolidate your understanding of this vital subject area

a) What course of action do you take? 4) State all the procedures you have to adopt from then to the

conclusion of the interview, quoting the words you would use,
This is a difficult situation to deal with during a voluntary
interview. If the suspect offender was under arrest, the
interview would be conducted at a designated Police Station,
and the Custody Officer would automatically offer them the
services of a Duty Solicitor.

You would start by issuing the second caution:

“I have to inform you that you may have rendered yourself
liable to prosecution. You do not have to say anything but it
‘may harm your defence if you do not mention now something
which you later rely on in court. Anything you do say may be
given in evidence. Do you wish to clarify anything you have
said or add anything else before the end of the interview.”
Than hand the interviewee form CS019 and state:

“Here is a leaflet that explains what will happen to the

tapes. I am about to stop the machine. One of the tapes will

be sealed. Will you please sign the seal before I stop the
‘mackine.”

However, if this situation arises during a voluntary interview
in your own office, you are duty bound to try and comply with
the interviewee’s request.

You should firstly state “I am going to stop the tape while you
arrange for your Solicitor to attend, The time is now...”.

You should then stop the recorder ~ but not remove the tapes.
When the Solicitor arrives, the machine should be re-started.

There are several options open to you if the interviewee does
‘not have a Solicitor:

After the seal has been signed by all parties present you stop

remains in the interview room until the Friend arrives, You
would normally turn the tapes off and restart thent when the
Support Officer returns with the Friend. If the break was
expected to be very short, however, there would be no problem
with leaving the tapes running.

You could telephone the nearest designated Police Station ask
the Custody Officer for the name of the Duty Solicitor and
speak to him.

+ You could consider continuing the interview at the Police
Station (on a voluntary basis rather than as a result of
arresting the suspect) where the services of the Duty Solicitor
would be provided free of charge.

Ifyou do turn the tapes off, itis advisable to ask the
interviewee to confirm, when the interview resumes on tape,
that no questions have been asked during the break.

This is a difficult area and further discussion will take place
during the Practical Skills Course. Do remember, however,
that if you are ever placed in a position such as this and need
advice, contact your Line Manager or the SIS Helpdesk/out-
