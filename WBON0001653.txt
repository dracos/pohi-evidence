Dear Sirs

Post Office Group Litigation
Horizon Issues Trial - Disclosure

Please find enclosed 32 documents that have come to our attention as part of another, legally privileged,
piece of work that we are carrying out for our client.

Without waiving privilege in that work, our client asked us to advise on an operational change on 29
August 2019. During discussions to scope that piece of work we learned that as part of the operational
change, Fujitsu was in the process of producing documents containing explanations of seven issues that
had recently arisen. We then received copies of 12 documents relating to 12 issues on 16 September
2019. We subsequently requested copies of the Peaks and a KEL referred to in those documents that
had not already been disclosed and we are providing them to you now. On 23 September we received
another document relating to another issue and we are disclosing it together with the Peak referred to
therein.

We will provide formal disclosure of these documents with Begin Bates numbers shortly.

Yours faithfully

[OKO (ux) ue.
