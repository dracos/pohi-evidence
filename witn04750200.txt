I, Jarnail Singh, will say as follows:



   1. I am providing this statement in response to a request for information dated

       16 February 2024, pursuant to Rule 9 of the Inquiry Rules 2006 — Request

       number 2, regarding matters failing within Phases 5 and 6 of the Inquiry. This

       is the second request that has been made to me under the Inquiry Rules 2006

       and is written further to my first statement dated 6 October 2023

       (WITN04750100).



   2. In writing this statement, can confirm that I have considered the documents

       previously sent to me by the Inquiry, my first witness statement

3. 1 can confirm that I am represented and have had legal assistance in writing

   this statement from Ashfords LLP.




4. The below deals the nature and extent of my involvement with POL's

   response to complaints made by Sub-Postmasters (SPMs), Justice For Sub-

   Postmasters Alliance (JFSA), MPs or journalists as to the integrity of the

   Horizon IT System or POL's prosecution of SPMs based on data generated

   by that system.

6. 1 had no formal role in POL's response to complaints made by SPMs, JFSA,

   MPs or journalists as to the integrity of the Horizon IT System. Nor did I have

   any formal role in POL's response to complaints made by SPMs, JFSA, MPs

   or journalists as to POL's prosecution of SPMs based on data generated by

   that system. As far as I am aware, POL's senior legal team (General Counsel

   and Head of Legal) were sometimes involved in these matters and I was

   sometimes asked to provide input or comment on specific matters.



7. Cartwright King (CK) were involved in a large number of prosecutions prior to

   the separation of POL from RMG and following separation, all prosecutions

   were outsourced to CK and I worked in liaison with them, including their

   solicitors, in-house and external counsel. Prosecution advice on

   charges/charging decisions was provided directly by CK to the

   Investigation/Security team. On some occasions, particularly in 2012 when

   the process at POL was bedding in, the charging advice was sent by CK to

   me and I forwarded it on to the decision maker in the Investigation/Security

   team.




8. Charging decisions and decisions on discontinuing cases, remained with the

   Investigation/Security team, as it had prior to the separation of POL from

   RMG. Given the interplay between these individuals/parties and in light of

   issues being raised in relation to Horizon, I would always involve the more

   senior in-house lawyers at POL and CK in relation to requests for

   information/instructions and handling decisions relating to cases which fell

   under CK's care and conduct.

                                                                                 WITNO4750200




9. As an example. I was asked by Dave Pardoe, Senior Security Manager, who

   was the decision maker in the case involving Mrs Merritt relating to the

   Yetminster branch, to draft some wording in relation to the decision not to

   continue with her case. I recall that Susan Crichton has already asked me to

   obtain CK's papers and to summarise the case for her and she had input on

   the wording of the letter to Mrs Merritt. As my email dated 26th June 2012

   (POL00141386) then confirms, the final wording of the letter followed a

   discussion which I had with the Company Secretary, Alwen Lyons, who

   approved it in Susan's absence. The drafting was in accordance with the

   company's position and drafted on the instructions of General Counsel and

   Company Secretary. I had the assurances that I believed that everyone else

   had and had no reason at this time to have any reason to doubt the

   truthfulness of the statement.



10. In the same matter, I was asked by Susan Crichton, General Counsel,

   (POL00143339) on 9 July 2012 whether agreed with some proposed

   wording and I advised on removing a sentence from a press release where

   the sentence could be criticised for implying how the court would have dealt

   with the case had it proceeded. I felt that that was not appropriate and

   suggested it be removed.


11. I was not involved in the decision to instruct Second Sight (SS) and became

   aware of their appointment after the decision had been made to appoint them.

   As far as I can recall. I had no contact with them at all and nor would I have

   expected to have. I may have been involved in ad hoc requests for

                                    Page 5 of 53
                                                                                     W ITN04750200
                                                                                 WITNO4750200




   information but even then I recall that it was another person who would have

   actually located the information and provided it to SS.



12 Once I became aware of their involvement I was asked to draft some wording

   (POL00058155) for what I understood to be a general explanatory statement

   regarding their role and remit. This was all based on information given to me

   as I had no involvement in determining the scope of their role and it was

   drafted at the request of Hugh Flemington, Head of Legal . The wording was

   then picked up by Head of PR and Media and approved by the Company

   Secretary. Once it was approved, I provided the wording to CK and Counsel

   for use as required in ongoing cases because it was anticipated that the

   involvement of Second Sight was going to give rise to queries/challenges by

   Defendant's legal teams in ongoing matters. I had no role in any wider public

   communications strategy concerning the SS review.


13. My view on the instruction of SS, at this stage in mid-2012, was that it was a

   positive move from POL in wanting to address concerns that were raised in

   some specific cases. I had no view on the choice of SS.


14. 1 was not involved in the drafting of SS's terms of reference and/or the

   decision-making process regarding the ambit of its investigations. Based on

   an email dated 11th July 2012 (P L00143374) from Susan Crichton

   explaining SS's role, my understanding is that SS were forensic accountants.

   Given that expertise, it was my understanding that they were not looking into

   technical IT matters nor the legal process. Susan said that "at the present

   there is no intention to undertake a full forensic review of the Horizon system".


                                   Page 6 of 53
                                                                                     W ITNO4750200
                                                                                  WITN04750200




   My understanding initially was that they were going to be reporting back within

   a few weeks.


15. 1 felt that I needed to understand their role and remit so that I could provide an

   explanation regarding their involvement to CK, who were continuing to handle

   criminal matters for POL where the involvement of SS was bound to be raised

   by defence lawyers and possibly by the Courts.


16. 1 am aware that CK notified me when the defence solicitors in the R v Wylie

   prosecution contacted them about SS's investigation into Horizon. In an email

   dated 9th July 2012 (POL00143374) Andy Cash asked me to provide "a clear

   steer from the centre" and I therefore forwarded the request for instructions to

   Hugh Flemington and Susan Crichton. I also discussed the involvement of

   SS with Hugh Flemington in person but I do not recall that discussion in any

   detail. I recall that I was concerned that Susan and Hugh understood that

   once proceedings were issued in criminal matters, the courts were not likely to

   agree to lengthy stays of proceedings to allow SS to produce their report. The

   risk to POL were applications by the defence on the grounds of abuse of

   process. I therefore asked what POL's position ought to be in relation to

   ongoing proceedings but also in pending and future investigations.


17. Susan Crichton responded to me on 11th July 2012 confirming the scope and

   reiterated that "POL has no reason to believe that there is any issue with the

   integrity of the Horizon System and the current investigation is limited in

   scope and number of cases". She confirmed they had not at that stage been

   formally appointed and she attached a copy of the draft proposed terms of

   reference for their instruction.

                                      Page 7 of 53
                                                                                     W ITNO4750200
                                                                                   WITNO4750200




18. 1 was not asked to review those terms of reference but I did so because I

   thought it would be helpful for CK to have them to enable them to respond to

   the defence solicitors on the Wylie case and so that they better understood

   the position generally. When I reviewed the draft terms I noted that the

   wording included an instruction for SS to study relevant evidence with regard

   to the Horizon system and I queried with Susan whether this could be deleted.

   To the best of my recollection, the reason I think I took issue with this was

   because SS were not looking at the legal process and I felt the word

   `evidence' was potentially confusing. i recognised that SS's primary focus

   was to look into the accounting processes in respect of the cases in question

   and completely understood that in order to do so they would need

   documentation/information, and I was not seeking to propose anything

   different in terms of overall scope. With the benefit of hindsight I was not

   being invited to comment and probably should not have done so. I do not

   know if my comments were taken on board or how SS's initial terms of

   reference were progressed.



19. I believe that responsibility for the ambit of SS's investigation ultimately was a

   decision for the Board, supported by General Counsel and Head of Legal. I

   believe that Belinda Crowe and her team may also have worked with SS, as

   well as external lawyers Bond Dickinson (BD). At some point, Brian Altman

   KC was also instructed to advise and suggested that a criminal lawyer have

   some involvement in working with SS and so CK became involved, although I

   do not recall when this was.

                                                                                     WITNO4750200




20. 1 believe BD and CK fielded requests for documents. Sometimes I was asked

   if I could provide information and I believe most of the requests for documents

   I received were from BD. I recall identifying for them where papers were held.

   I believe some may have been retained in RMG archives for matters

   concluded before the separation of POL in which case I made some enquiries

   where papers were held and where they could be obtained


21. Generally I do not feel that I was sufficiently close to the work that SS were

   doing to comment on whether they were given sufficient information by POL

   to carry out its instructions over the course of its engagement.


22. I recall that following the involvement of SS being discussed in the context of

   the R v Wylie case, Harry Bowyer, in--house Counsel at CK, advised on the

   way forward in ongoing criminal cases (POL00026567). Harry advised that

   POL should carry out a review of cases where Horizon challenges were

   raised and appoint a disclosure officer to deal with disclosure of Horizon

   challenge related information. Helen Rose was a member of the Security

   Team and was given that role.


23. I have been asked about a database which I refer to as having been kept by

   the criminal law team in an email dated 24th July 2012 (POL00143453). This

   email was in response to an information request by Mr Bates for information

   as to how many years RMG>POL held details of prosecutions. In my response

   to Chris Darvill in the POL Legal team, I referred to a database of

   prosecutions being kept by RMG since 2009, which Rob Wilson, RMG Head

   of Criminal Law, had informed was kept by RMG. I had no knowledge of this

   database and do not remember adding any case details to any database

                                   Page 9 of 53
                                                                                    W ITNO4750200
                                                                                  WITNO4750200




   when I was with RMG. I spoke to my former colleague Rob Wilson who told

   me about this database before I replied to Chris. I do not know what

   information it held and/or whether any information was recorded on the

   database in respect of Horizon failures.


24.At this stage in 2012, CK had care and conduct of all POL criminal

   prosecutions. i retained no records specifically in relation to Horizon

   challenges but I believe that such information would have been available from

   CK and the Investigation/Security Team. As I mentioned above, on Harry

   Bowyer's advice, Helen Rose from the Security Team was tasked to look into

   in which cases Horizon had been challenged and organising disclosure.


25. 1 have been asked about an email to Rachel Panter of CK dated 21St February

   2013 (POL00325434) and the basis on which I considered it appropriate to

   accept a plea to false accounting on the proviso that the defendant wrote that

   they did not challenge the integrity of the Horizon IT System. It had always

   been the position during RMG days and then at POL that Horizon was robust

   and consequently the business would not accept a plea on the basis that

   Horizon was at fault. I do not know what the letter from the defence solicitors

   says as it has not been provided — it is possible that my email is a response to

   something stated in that letter — but generally, the Court needs to be able to

   understand on what basis the plea is made and accepted so that it can

   sentence accordingly and if this is not clear, then there is a risk that the Court

   might order a Newton hearing. Having the defendant put the basis of plea in

   writing was usually of assistance to the defence in mitigation and provided

   clarity to the Court and Rob Wilson had always encouraged us to having it


                                   Page 10 of 53
                                                                                     W ITN04750200
                                                                                 WITNO4750200




   clearly set out in writing. In this instance, I do not know why I have provided

   these instructions as they would usually have been provided by the

   investigator, who in this case was Stephen Bradshaw. I do not believe that

   the ongoing SS investigation had any bearing on this decision or the basis

   upon which the plea was agreeable — the reasoning for the decision was

   consistent with the RMG/POL position prior to SS.



26. 1 have also been asked about an email from Helen Rose dated 3rd August

   2012 (POL00175144) where she says "In our previous phone call you

   mentioned where sometimes there would be bargaining and some cases

   would be charged with false accounting rather than theft and false accounting

   on the proviso that the horizon system is not brought into question". I cannot

   now recall the specifics of any call with Helen Rose in August 2012. I believe

   the purpose of the call was me reminding her that she needed to cast the net

   wide when looking for any previous cases of Horizon being challenged,

   including cases where theft, false accounting and theft and false accounting

   had been charged.



27. All cases/charging decisions were assessed on the evidence and having

   regard to the Code for Crown Prosecutors. This is evidenced by the memos

   from the Legal Team to the Security/Investigation Team and in the advice

   from external lawyers where involved. I do not believe that charges were

   selected on the proviso that the Horizon IT System is not brought into

   question. POL wouldn't know whether a defendant was going to raise a

   Horizon issue as part of a defence and wouldn't therefore select charges on


                                  Page 11 of 53
                                                                                    W ITN04750200
                                                                                  WITNO4750200




   this basis. I believe the reference to plea bargaining is a reference to where

   the defence would occasionally approach POL with an offer to plead to either

   a lesser offence or to plead guilty on a limited basis. This is action which

   would be instigated by the defence and which POL would consider and

   respond to, rather than being instigated by POL.



28. 1 am not aware that POL's position on the acceptance of pleas in prosecutions

   brought by SPMs changed following the announcement of the SS review.

   The main charge for me in 2012 was that CK took over the care and conduct

   of all prosecution cases from 15t April 2012.


29. I have been asked about the nature and extent of my involvement in the

   decision to discontinue the proposed prosecutions against Ms Merrit, Ms

   Wylie and Uppal. Decisions of this nature were usually for the investigator in

   the Security Team, but as set out above, at this time due to the involvement of

   SS, I did have some discussions with the Company Secretary, Head of Legal

   and General Counsel. In all 3 cases CK were instructed.


30. I do not know to what extent POL was concerned to ensure that others did not

   attribute decisions to discontinue prosecutions to concerns as to the reliability

   of the Horizon IT System. I don't recall prosecutions being routinely

   discontinued, hence Harry Bowyer's input on how cases should be case

   managed from a disclosure perspective if Horizon was challenged.


31. I have been asked about the decision to discontinue the Merrit case and the

   extent to which I considered this to be consistent with POL's public position on

   the reason for dropping the case. My recollection is that the decision not to

   proceed was down to the intervention of Oliver Letwin MP. I note that the case

   closure report at POL00143303 cites "Prosecution case dropped as this case

   will now form part of the external review for Horizon Integrity challenges". I

   accept there is some inconsistency here but I do not feel able to comment

   further as I was not involved in the decision to discontinue this case. Any

   involvement I had in the decision letter to Mrs Merrit was on the instructions of

   the Company Secretary and I do not recall being informed about the nature of

   the Horizon issue being alleged or of the decision for the case to be reviewed

   by SS.


32. 1 was primarily interested in Harry Bowyer's advice (POL00026567) in terms

   of his views on how best to manage the disclosure issues which were

   envisaged. In particular I remember thinking about some of the previous

   issues where we had needed to go to Fujitsu for data. I do not particularly

   remember having a view on his comment "I assume that we still contend that

   the system is fool proof in which case we should defend it aggressively" I felt

   it was for POL to determine its position. In any event, it was on the same day

   that Susan Crichton set out in an email to me POL's position that it had no

   reason to believe that there was any issue with the integrity of Horizon


33.As far as I can recall, POL's approach to bringing or maintaining prosecutions

   did not change upon the appointment of Second Sight. Each case was still

   considered on a case by case basis and having regard to the Code for Crown

   Prosecutors. I do not recall there being any policy shift as a result of the

   appointment of SS.

34. In relation to applications by SPMs for stays of prosecutions on the basis of

   the SS review, I wanted CK to advise as they were handling all prosecutions.

   I felt that blanket stays would be problematic as the criminal courts would not

   be happy to defer indefinitely matters where individuals were facing trial. I

   wanted CK to advise on it and they proposed a route forward whereby POL

   might agree on a case by case basis not to oppose stays sought by

   defendants (POL00186039).




35. The below deals with the nature and extent of any involvement that I had in

   POL's response to SS's Interim Report. In answering the Inquiry's questions

   on this subject, I can confirm that I have reviewed the following documents:

     vi.     POLO0099063 (Second Sight Interim Report).



36. 1 do not recall having any communications or meetings with SS in the run up

   to the provision of the Interim Report.



37. 1 do not recall exactly when I received the SS Interim Report but upon reading

   it i remember being concerned, both in relation to its findings around bugs but

   also the comments around issues with training and support to SPMs. I

   recognised that this was something that needed immediate expert advice from

   POL's external lawyers, CK. I do not recall exactly when this happened but

   because I had been involved in previous prosecution cases I recall it was

   decided that I should not be centrally involved in any review or any follow up

   action.


38. 1 recall that CK advised POL on next steps and Brian Altman KC was

   instructed to review processes, including CK's processes. Martin Smith and

   Simon Clark of CK were primarily providing their advice to Head of Legal and

   General Counsel. I do not recall the detail of any conversations with the POL

   legal team around this issue.


39. I have been asked what I knew of Project Sparrow and my involvement with it.

   This was, I think, a senior management or Board level project. I do not know

   anything about it. I recall the name but I don't think I had any involvement in

   it.

40. 1 can confirm that I have reviewed the following documents in respect of the

   Helen Rose report:



      i.   POL00022598 ("the Helen Rose report");

     ii.   POL00323841 (email chain between Rodric Williams, Martin Smith and

           others in July 2013); and



           17 June 2013).



41. 1 cannot recall when I first read the Helen Rose report but I assume that it was

   in June or July 2013, and I assume before 10th July, when CK advised Hugh

   Flemington on disclosure of the report in the Ishaq prosecution case




   following Harry Bowyer's advice in the Wylie case but I do not recall if her

   report stemmed directly from that involvement or if she was provided any

   other instructions. If she was, I believe they must have come from Hugh

   Flemington or Susan Crichton. For the avoidance of doubt, I did not request

   .i .iiiruiifltii1tI



43. My initial response on reading Helen's report was one of concern and I recall

   that I wanted CK's advice on what to do. Specifically, I recall thinking that if it

                                                                                     WITNO4750200




   was correct that Gareth Jenkins knew of Horizon integrity issues that was a

   real concern.


44. 1 have been asked to what extent, if at all, did I think that points raised within

   the Helen Rose report cast doubt on the safety of the convictions of SPMs

   whose prosecutions was based wholly or partly on Horizon data. I had no

   expertise in considering whether Helen's report gave rise to safety of

   conviction issues. I do not recall whether safety of convictions was

   immediately addressed by CK following receipt of Helen's report but I believe

   that this was something which Simon Clarke was quickly advising POL in

   relation to, and it certainly forms part of his written advice on 8th July 2013

   (PO LOU 006365).


45. 1 do not recall being involved in the response to the report. From the

   information at this time provided by the Inquiry I can see that matters were

   being handled by Hugh Flemington and Rodric Williams, who was a litigation

   lawyer, and I was kept in copy.


46. In terms of whether the Helen Rose Report was disclosable, whilst I always

   deferred to CK on such matters, my view was that if it met the test for

   disclosure it should be disclosed. For the avoidance of doubt, I agreed with

   CK's advice that it should be disclosed.


47. 1 have been asked about my email to Andrew Parsons of BD dated 17'h June

   2014 (POL00129392). written approximately 1 year after Helen Rose's Report

   was provided.

  48. The approach and advice by Andrew Parsons which I responded to is in

     relation to the Mediation Scheme. I had no involvement in, authority over, or

     any opinion on how those matters should be conducted. The reason i did

     respond was because the email referred to discussions between BD and CK,

     and CK were continuing to deal with POL criminal cases. Martin Smith and

     Simon Clarke from CK were copied into the email and by responding, I

     wanted to give affirmation to CK. My reference to agreeing to deal with issues

     on a case by case basis is affirmation in relation to the penultimate para

     relating to the suggestion that CK support with any queries the Investigation

     Team have with how to deal with the Helen Rose Report.


  49. I reiterate that I was in support of disclosure of any evidence where it was

     relevant and met the test for disclosure and I in no way intended to support

     any suggestion of how to deal with the Helen Rose Report in CQRs which

     were part of the Mediation Scheme process. As everyone knew my role

     related to criminal matters only and i had no authority to give instructions

     regarding the conduct of the Mediation Scheme, I do not believe that anyone

     would have taken my email as an instruction to minimalize or entirely ignore

     the Helen Rose Report when responding to applications to the Mediation

     Scheme.


THE WEEKLY HORIZON CALL

  50. The below deals with my involvement in the Horizon regular call set up after

     the Interim Report. In answering the Inquiry's questions around this subject

     matter, I can confirm that I have reviewed the following documents:




                                    Page 18 of 53
                                                                                        W ITNO4750200
                                                                                   WITNO4750200




       i.   POL00083932 (record of Horizon regular call on 19 July 2013);

      ii.   POL00139731 (record of Horizon regular call on 24 July 2013);

     iii.   POL00139732 (record of Horizon regular call on 31 July 2013);

    iv.     POL00139745 (Martin Smith's attendance note made on 1 August

            2013);

     v.     POL00325474 (my email to Martin Smith on 1 August 2013);

    vi.     POL00006799 (advice from Simon Clarke dated 2 August 2013);

    vii.    POL00083930 (record of Horizon regular call on 14 August 2013);

   viii.    POL00139748 (Martin Smith's attendance note from 14 August 2013);

    ix.     POL00129005 (Rob King's email to me on 19 August 2013);

     x.     POL00325492 (my email on 2.0 August 2013);

    xi.     POL00089720 (record of Horizon regular call on 21 August 2013);

    xii.    POL00139728 (record of Horizon regular call on 28 August 2013); and

   xiii.    POL00323677 (my email to Susan Crichton on 20 September 2013).



51. I believe the weekly Horizon call followed the advice of CK around having a

   central place where Horizon issues could be dealt with in one place, making

   the disclosure process easier. To the best of my recollection, I think Susan

   Crichton tasked the Investigation/ Security Team with this following CK's

   advice.



52. I was not involved in setting up the weekly call and was not in attendance at

   the first meeting on 19th July 2013 and do not recall if I was briefed on it but I

   did attend on 24111 July 2013 and thereafter. I do not recall the discussions

   held on the weekly calls over and above what is set out in the call records.

                                                                                  WITNO4750200




53.On reviewing the record of the call on 24th July 2013 (POL00139731) I do not

   fully understand the comment "No minutes circulated, but we will all be taking

   notes."Clearly a record was taken, so I don't know if it was being suggested

   that minutes/notes shouldn't be taken and I don't recall any discussion on this

   issue.



54.On reviewing the record of the call on 31St July 2013 (POL00139732); 1 can't

   recall what was discussed in respect of the Helen Rose Report. Further, I

   can't see any reference to the creation of minutes or notes so I can't recall if

   there was any discussion around this on that call.


55. 1 recall that after the weekly meeting on 31st July 2013, which I believe took

   place in the morning, Dave Posnett came to see me. Dave was seeking my

   guidance because he said that John Scott had instructed him that typed

   minutes of the weekly calls should be scrapped and / or shredded. I

   immediately felt very uncomfortable and I told Dave Posnett very clearly that

   he must not do that and that he should tell John Scott the same. I recognised

   that this was a serious issue and I called Martin Smith at CK. I think I might

   have even done this when Dave Posnett was present so that he could talk to

   Martin Smith if needed, but I am not certain of this. In any event I relayed

   word for word what Dave Posnett had told me and I believe Martin Smith's

   record is an accurate note. I believe I also spoke with Hugh Flemington about

   this but this might not have been on the same day.

                                                                                     WITNO4750200




56. The reason for calling Martin Smith was to seek his assistance given POL's

   criminal litigation disclosure obligations. Markin told me to leave it with him —

   he said he would speak with Simon Clarke and they would deal with it and

   respond. Martin told me that Simon was in the process of providing advice for

   POL on disclosure and if I emailed him he could incorporate any points I

   wished to be covered in that note. I therefore emailed Martin the next

   morning setting out my request (POL00325474).


57. Reviewing matters now, I can see that I have copied and pasted wording

   attributed to Andrew Parsons of BD from the 19th July 2013 weekly Horizon

   call, which I did not attend — "If its produced its available for disclosure — if not

   minuted then technically its not" I therefore assume that I was provided with a

   copy of the record of that call.


58. What I wanted Simon Clarke to cover in his advice was an explanation that

   disclosure obligations extended not simply to what was recorded, but what

   was known. Simon included this within his advice note (POL00006799) dated

   2rd August 2013 under a section entitled The Duty to Record and Retain'.


59. I agreed with the advice and I think the position was very clearly set out.


60. In terms of the advice note at paragraphs 5i. to 5iv. I cannot recall precisely

   whether my conversation with Dave Posnett covered all of these matters

   and/or whether I relayed all of this to Martin Smith, but I do recall Dave using

   the word "shredded" which is referred to at Si. I note that Martin Smith was on

   all of the weekly Horizon calls and if anything relating to the retention of

   information was discussed on the 19th July 2013 call, then Martin might have

                                                                                  WITNO4750200




   direct knowledge/recollection of that and this might have fed into the advice

   note.


61. 1 cannot recall who the advice from Simon Clarke was provided to but I do

   recall seeing it. I believe it was agreed that BD would minute the weekly

   Horizon call moving forwards.


62. 1 have been asked to set out my recollection of a phone call with Martin Smith

   on 14th August 2013. 1 recall that I called Martin Smith when I learned that

   John Scott had been asked to chair the weekly Horizon call which was taking

   place that day. Given the issues which Dave Posnett informed me of on 31st

   July 2013 1 was concerned with John Scott being on the call. I believe Susan

   Crichton asked John Scott to chair the call. I recall that Martin Smith shared

   my concern which is why his attendance note refers to it being "not

   appropriate' (PL00139748).


63. 1 do not recall the weekly Horizon call which took place on 14th August 2013

   but having reviewed the record of this call (POL00083930) I believe that there

   was some discussion around concerns from the network team about not

   prosecuting where the allegation related to theft by a member of staff of a

   SPM. I believe this was because the SPM would remain liable for the

   shortfall/debt. There is then a reference to the network team raising "comms

   issues" and needing "a line of communication". Rodric Williams then appears

   to pick this up and one of the actions from the meeting is for Rodric to

   circulate a process for comms to Security and Legal. I cannot recall anything

   further in relation to this call .

64. 1 have been asked about an email sent to me on 19th August 2013 from Rob

   King (POL00129005). As set out above. I had concerns about the record

   keeping in relation to the Horizon weekly call but I do not know what prompted

   Rob to email me. It may be that we bumped into each other as we worked in

   the same building. I do not know who briefed him on the creation, storage

   and distribution of minutes and/or notes. I believe Rob King was ex-Police

   and on review of his email, he is setting out to me his views and governance

   concerns in relation to the process established. I can see that he is

   expressing the view that the Security team was not the best place to be

   resolving issues with Horizon but don't completely understand his email in

   terms of the establishment of a working group placing the weekly calls

   superfluous and reference to Susan's concerns.


65. I have been asked to explain the views expressed in my email to Susan

   Crichton on 20 September 2013 (POL00323677) regarding not inviting Fujitsu

   to a meeting. For the avoidance of doubt, this was not concerning the weekly

   Horizon call which took place on Wednesday mornings. This was a separate

   meeting between POL lawyers only and the reason for me expressing this

   view was purely down to issues of legal privilege. My email was in response

   to and in agreement with, the advice provided to Susan Crichton by Martin

   Smith of CK.


66. 1 do not know why Susan Crichton left POL. I believe I knew a few weeks

   before that she was leaving. I had limited one to one contact with Susan as I

   reported to Hugh Flemington, Head of Legal.

67. The Inquiry have asked me to set out the nature and extent of any

   involvement I had in POL's review of past convictions of SPMs based on data

   generated by the Horizon IT System following the Interim Report, including

   the consideration of whether to disclose the Interim Report of the Helen Rose

   report. I can confirm that I have reviewed the following documents:

68. I do not recall being involved in POL's review of past convictions following the

   SS Interim Report. As I mentioned above, I recall that because I had been

   involved in previous prosecution cases I believe it was decided that I should

   not be involved in any review or any follow up action.



69. 1 do not think that I attended the conference on 3rd July 2013 at POL Head

   Office concerning issues in relation to Horizon and the prosecution of criminal

   offences by POL.

70. 1 have been asked to set out whether I or others in the POL legal department

   considered whether it was necessary or appropriate to search for further

   documentation or information relevant to the integrity, or lack thereof, of the

   Horizon IT System to consider disclosing it to SPMs convicted of theft, fraud

   or false accounting. All I can say is that I believe that CK advised and POL

   understood its ongoing disclosure duties and this formed part of CK's

   consideration and advice to POL on the actions required in past cases.


71. I am aware that at this time Simon Clarke at CK was advising POL on a

   number of matters, including disclosure and expert evidence issues. I believe

   that I agreed with Simon Clarke's advice on these matters. I note from my

   review of the documents Simon Clarke advised on 8th July 2013

   (POL00006365) that 16t January 2010 be the start date of the review process.

   I can't recall whether I received that advice but if i did, I believe I would have

   agreed that that was an appropriate starting point, based on what was known

   at that time around the Horizon issues. I noted this was to be kept under

   review. I note that Simon Clarke advised on 19th July 2013 (POL00006800) in

   relation to compensation for miscarriages of justice. Again, I do not recall

   whether I received that advice but for the avoidance of doubt I had no

   experience in relation to that issue and wouldn't have been in a position to

   agree or disagree with his advice.


72.On 24th July 2013 Brian Altman KC attended POL's offices and I recall that

   Susan Crichton asked me to attend a meeting with him where he was

   introduced to me and others. I do not recall details of the meeting but having

   reviewed the draft terms of reference for his appointment (POL00297953), I

   believe the meeting was an introductory meeting for CK and I was to provide

   him with some initial information about the past and current prosecution

   process.


73. 1 had no involvement in setting Brian Altman KC's terms of reference. In

   particular, I was not involved in any discussion regarding whether he should

   be instructed to review the "efficacy" or "safety" of past prosecutions. I do not

   know why POL decided that Brian would advise on the efficacy of CK's role

   rather than the safety of the convictions but I note that Gavin Matthews of BD

   expressed the view in an email dated 9th August 2013 (POL00021980) that

   Brian shouldn't advise on safety and it may be that POL were content to follow

   his advice for the reasons he set out.



74. 1 have been asked to describe my view on Brian Altman KC's Interim Review

   of CK's Current Process dated 2 August 2013 (POL00006583). I cannot

   recall when or even if I received this advice and therefore what my views on it

   were. I assume that the advice was provided to BD and they would have

   shared it with CK. As this was an interim review, I am not sure if it resulted in

   changes to the approach to reviewing criminal cases.


75.On 9t" September 2013 I together with colleagues from POL legal, CK and BD

   attended a conference with Brian Altman KC. I have reviewed BD's note of

   the conference (POL00006485) and another note of the conference

   (POL00139866) which I think might have been taken by Rodric Williams or

   one of the CK team. I do not precisely recall the conference but I am not

   aware of any material omissions from the notes. I note that the notes refer to

   a response from Harry Bowyer of CK to Brian Altman KC's interim review. 1

                                                                                   WITNO4750200




   do not believe that I received Harry's response, or if I did I cannot now recall

   the contents of it, and i haven't received a copy of it from the Inquiry.


76. 1 don't recall whether there was any discussion in relation to failing to record

   minutes or the destruction of any minutes/notes. I don't understand the

   reference to cultural issues attributed to Simon Clarke of CK in the notes. Nor

   do I recall the comment attributed to Susan Crichton that "people then dump"

   I believe it was Susan who also mentioned that there had been a "cash audit"

   and I do not have any further information in relation to any such cash audit. I

   don't recall whether there was any discussion of the `Callender Square bug'.


77. I have been asked to consider the note, 'It was widely agreed there was likely

   to be a "band wagon" approach in relation to defendant challenging the

   previous convictions". I believe that Brian Altman KC might have used this

   term — it also appears at paragraph 55 of his General Review

   (POL00006581). All I took from this was that there was an acknowledgement

   of the likely volume of challenges and experienced counsel seems to be

   highlighting this likely result based on his experience. With the benefit of

   hindsight, the terms shouldn't have been used but I do not think that it was in

   any way intended as a derogatory comment nor was it I believe, intended to

   describe SPMs in a negative manner.


78. I have been asked about the advice given by Brian Altman KC regarding the

   mediation scheme where he advised caution in relation to mediating with

   individuals previously convicted. I had no experience in mediation cases or

   the interplay between a mediation scheme and criminal procedure and so I

   was in no position to agree or disagree with Brian's advice on this issue. I do

                                   Page 28 of 53
                                                                                    W ITN04750200
                                                                                   WITNO4750200




   not know what was being referred to in terms of information which a convicted

   SPM would "not normally be entitled to" but which "lawyers acting for those

   individuals" may be seeking `in order to pursue an appeal". I recall that my

   primary concern was in relation to POL's ongoing duty of disclosure in

   criminal cases including in relation to completed matters, and I knew the CK

   review was going on for that reason.


79. 1 have been asked about the General Review advice note dated 15h October

   2013 of Brian Altman KC ( POL00006581). I don't know when I first read it

   and I don't specifically recall it. Brian refers to the cash audit at paragraph 64

   of the advice. As above, I have no knowledge of this. In relation to my

   understanding of any discussion of the "Callendar Square / Falkirk Bug", all I

   can recall now is that I think that it was mentioned by the defence expert in

   the Misra case but this was explained by Gareth Jenkins. I had no technical

   knowledge relating to Horizon or IT systems more generally and so would not

   have known whether it was accurate to refer to the "Callender Square / Falkirk

   Bug" as an isolated instance. My understanding of the advice was that the

   cases falling for review should be those from 1St January 2010 onward but that

   if during mediation any earlier issues were raised, including for example other

   instances of the "Callendar Square / Falkirk Bug" having been reported, then

   those events would likely be disclosable. If I received and reviewed this

   advice at the time I believe I would have agreed with that approach.



80. 1 have been asked to consider the advice at paragraphs 129-132 and CK's

   desire to control the dissemination of information and material during the

   mediation process. I do not understand what position CK are suggesting is

                                   Page 29 of 53
                                                                                    W ITNO4750200
                                                                                  WITN04750200




   taken here. I had always taken the view that in criminal procedure the duty of

   disclosure was wide ranging. CK had supported this view previously on a

   number of occasions, in particular when I sought their advice in relation to the

   retention of records of the weekly Horizon calls, as set out above, and so I am

   not sure what sort of control they wanted to exercise in relation to the

   mediation process.


81. I believe the advice was primarily for the benefit of others in more senior roles,

   including Susan Crichton and Hugh Flemington. I do not know what actions

   were taken by POL upon receipt of this advice.


82. 1 have been asked to set out my recollection of the meeting between me,

   Brian Altman KC, Gavin Matthews, Andrew Parsons and Rodric Williams on

   18 November 2013. My note of this discussion (POL00146859) is not a very

   clear note but from what I recall of the discussion, I believe Anthony Hooper

   had suggested all convicted SPMs only had a route of challenge to the Court

   of Appeal, but Simon Clarke of CK had taken the view that they could be

   considered for mediation. I believe that Brian Altman KC agreed with Simon

   Clarke. I believe that he also wanted to review minutes of a meeting held

   between SS and BD. BD were on the call and I am not sure whether they

   provided Brian with the minutes from that meeting. I provided my notes of the

   call to Chris Aujard, who was the General Counsel who had been appointed

   after Susan Crichton left.


83. Brian Altman KC provided his advice on his review of POL's prosecution role

   on 19th December 2013 (POL00112937). In the executive summary part of

   this advice he described the Horizon data integrity issue as "an exceptional

                                   Page 30 of 53
                                                                                      W ITNO4750200
                                                                                  WITN04750200




   instance of POL prosecutorial failure of serial non-disclosure in breach of

   POL's disclosure obligations" Whilst I cannot see that he further explains this

   in the body of his advice, I understood this to be a reference to the failure of

   Fujitsu to provide full disclosure in cases, but for which RMG/POL as the

   prosecuting authority must accept responsibility.


84. 1 have been asked to set out my views on the conclusion that there was no

   need for POL to divest its role as a prosecutor. I understood the conclusion

   and did not disagree with the view provided. Overall, what I can recall at this

   time was all I could see were problems in proceeding with cases, given the

   disclosure issues and the lack of any expert witness. I recall not really seeing

   a way through this and I think by this stage I thought it would probably be

   better to stop prosecutions, but instead they were being held in the hope that

   we would find a new expert and a way to proceed.


85. 1 do not recall any other conferences with Brian Altman KC or Cartwright King

   concerning the integrity of Horizon or past or present prosecutions based on

   data generated by the Horizon IT System.


86. 1 don't believe that I had any real involvement in POL's response to the CCRC

   investigation. I recall that following Susan Crichton's departure, Sally Berlin,

   Director of Casework Operations at the CCRC, emailed Amanda Brown, PA

   to General Counsel, seeking an update. This correspondence was forwarded

   to me and I sent it on to BD who prepared the response for new General

   Counsel, Chris Aujard, to send back to the CCRC (POL00123515).

87. 1 have been asked to consider the case review advice dated 1st May 2014

   provided by Simon Clarke of CK in the case of Hosi (POL00133638). I do not

   I.T■TRAWSH: i'GtTil0101C'Im _ •        4   we      M11MTGV1 T-M: • _ ,. - 97:1

   were instructed on the reviews and because I had been involved in some of

   the previous cases I was not centrally involved in the reviews. I believe the

   case was one of Juliet MacFarlane's dealt with at RMG. I believe that Chris

   Aujard would have provided instructions to CK on the recommendations within

   the advice. I believe that on instructions CK would have provided disclosure.



88. 1 have been asked to set out the nature and extent of any involvement I had in

   POL's dealings with the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal and / or the

   Public Prosecution Service in Northern Ireland following the SS report. I recall

   that BTO were POL's Scottish agents and POL's cases were mainly handled

   by Laura Irvine. I do recall, and the notes of the conference with Brian Altman

   KC confirm, that I went to Scotland to discuss the ongoing Scottish cases with

   Laura Irvine. Martin Smith and Simon Clarke were also in attendance. I recall

   part of the discussion was whether all cases should be discontinued in

   Scotland or whether decisions should be taken on a case by case basis. I

   believe the view reached was to deal with each case on its merits. I do not

   recall having any wider involvement. I do not recall any involvement in

   Northern Ireland cases or what position was taken by POL in relation to

   Northern Ireland cases.

89. 1 have been asked to detail the nature and extent of my involvement in the

   Initial Complaint Review and Mediation Scheme. I had no role in the scheme.

   I recall that I responded to requests for information as and when requested.



90. 1 do not therefore know whether the Mediation Scheme impacted POL's

   conduct of prosecution or its review of past convictions. I know that CK and

   BD were more closely involved in the Mediation Scheme than I was and CK

   also held the role of reviewing past convictions and would have care and

   conduct of any ongoing matters. However, i recall that ongoing matters

   remained held up due to disclosure issues and the lack of an expert witness.


91. 1 have been asked to consider my email to Andrew Parsons on 17 April 2014

   (POL00169318) and an email chain between me, Belinda Crowe and others

   (POL00325950) and to set out the nature and extent of my involvement in: (a)

   deciding what documents should be provided to Second Sight during the

   Mediation Scheme and; (b) advising on legal professional privilege in respect

   of prosecution documents.


92. 1 recall that I was occasionally asked to comment on disclosure of certain

   documentation but overall my understanding was that there was an

   established process in place which ordinarily didn't involve me. As the above

   emails and my email dated 5th January 2015 confirm (POL00062588), I have

   responded to specific requests. On each occasion, I do not know what the

   ultimate decision on the provision of documents to SS was.

93. 1 don't recall providing any advice in respect of discussing the causes of

   losses at mediation with SPMs who had been convicted of false accounting.




94. The below deals the nature and extent of my involvement in POL seeking a

   new expert to opine on the integrity of the Horizon IT System in civil and

   criminal cases. I can confirm thatl have reviewed the following documents:



       i.   POL00146675 (my email to Alwen Lyons on 22 October 2013) and

            POL00146676 (attachment);

       ii. POLO0146919 (email chain regarding a meeting with Fujitsu);



            POLO0125569 (attachment);

       iv. POLOO148714 (email chain regarding the instruction of Imperial



      v. POLOO148749 (Simon Clarke's advice of 23 July 2014); and

      vi. POLOO149562 (email chain on 'Top 5 cases"); and

      vii . POL00325918 email from Andrew Pheasant to me on 1 October 2014),




95. I recall that I had some involvement in seeking a new expert to opine on the

   integrity of the Horizon IT System. I did not draft the paper (POL00146676)

   but I recall that I was asked by Susan Crichton or Hugh Flemington to seek

   Board approval. That was something I hadn't done before and I remember




                                  Page 34 of 53
                                                                                        W ITN04750200

   asking Susan how to do that and she advised that I needed to send the paper

   to Alwen Lyons, Company Secretary.



96. Within the papers provided to me by the Inquiry I can see there is reference to

   arrangements for a meeting with Fujitsu on 29t" November 2013

   (POLO0146919). I do not have any recollection of this meeting. i can recall

   that it took a long time to progress the instruction of new experts. I can see

   that I was involved in seeking approval from Chris Aujard, General Counsel,

   and others to the initial review proposal of Professor Kramer and Dr Dulay

   some 8 months later in July 2014 (POL00125568).



97. 1 have been asked to what extent, if at all, did I agree with Martin Smith of

   CK's advice not to investigate Legacy Horizon cases due to concerns that

   "disclosure issues could arise in historic cases". I recall that I was primarily

   concerned that the experts would have access to the information they felt they

   needed and there was to be no attempt to curtail what they were provided

   with. That was the reason for my email dated gth July 2014 in response to

   Martin Smith's (POLOO148714). I believe that once the need to ensure expert

   independence was explained I believe this was accepted and the discussion

   moved on.


98. My recollection was that the experts were being instructed in respect of the

   integrity of the current system. Separately, I felt that disclosure obligations in

   respect of past cases was by this stage well understood and the review

   process by OK was well underway, the terms of which were subject to the

   review by Brian Altman KC. On that basis I believe I would have agreed with

   Martin's view that the experts were not required to investigate the old Horizon

   system.


99. 1 have been asked what I meant in my email dated 14th July 2014

   (POL00148714) by saying "to instruct the expert to prepare the report in

   accordance with the scope but with the proviso that they immediately notify

   Cartwright King of anything which may cause POL concern' What I believe

   section 2 of my email relates to is a direct response to the cost and scope

   concerns set out by Andy Holt. who worked in IT, in his email of 10th July

   2014. Andy was concerned that the experts hadn't appreciated the scale of

   the task and was therefore concerned about the cost implications. In

   responding, I had in mind that the experts were due to provide monthly

   updates and monthly invoices to CK, and I wanted to explain to Andy that

   through this CK could keep control of the process from a scope and cost

   perspective. We wanted CK to interface with the experts to keep a degree of

   separation from POL to preserve their independence.



100.      1 have been asked to set out my views on Simon Clarke's Advice dated

   23 July 2014 (POL00148749). I requested this advice to provide all persons

   involved in the discussion regarding the instruction of the new experts with

   clarity on the approach to the provision of information to the experts and

   completely agreed with this advice. I believe that I shared this with all of the

   persons involved in that discussion.


101.      1 do not recall any significant further involvement in the instruction if the

   experts. I can see from the documentation provided by the Inquiry that I had

                                                                                       WITNO4750200




   some involvement in obtaining confidentiality agreements in September 2014

   (POL00325918) at the request of my line manager Jessica Madron. I do not

   recall having any involvement in the actual instructions to the experts, which I

   believe were drafted by BD and reviewed by CK.




102.        I can confirm that I have considered the following documents:

       i.   POL00148973 (email chain including myself and Rodric Williams on 9

            September 2014; and

       ii. UKG100018250 (Significant Litigation report dated November 2014).



103.        To the best of my recollection, the significant litigation report included

   sections dealing with civil litigation and criminal litigation. I believe that CK

   drafted the criminal litigation update and I reviewed and inputted as necessary

   and then passed it to Rodric Williams. Rodric then reviewed and amended as

   before it was submitted to the Board.



104.        I note in the November 2014 report (UKG100018250) there is reference

   to there being a "number of cases which could have been prosecuted (e.g_

   those with full and frank admission to theft / fraud, but prosecutions were not

   commenced to avoid adverse judicial comment" I do not recall which cases

   are being referred to here and I believe CK would be able to provide further

   information. My recollection is that there was a concern that even where "full

   and frank admissions" had been made there was still a concern that with

   Horizon issues being so widely publicised, Defendants would plead not guilty

   and POL would then face potential disclosure issues and have no expert

   witness. I believe that at this time the Head of Security, John Scott, was still

   the decision maker for cases. Chris Aujard may have been involved in

   reviewing which cases should proceed, but I am not sure.




105.      I can confirm that I have considered the following documents:



       ii. POL00021816 (email from Andrew Parsons to me dated 20 August

           1           'It       #tI               11i      :         • ''•   !11

106.      1 have been asked to set out the nature and extent of my involvement

   in POL's response to SS's Briefing Reports. Whilst the first briefing report

   dated 25'" July 2014 arrived whilst I was with POL (POL00004439), the

   second report was dated 9th April 2015 by which time I had left POL and I did




107.      1 do not recall whether I was provided with the Briefing Report Part 1. 1

   believe SS provided their reports to BD. Rodric Williams was the main POL

   lawyer involved and Martin Smith of CK and his colleagues at CK were

   involved in the mediation scheme.

108.      I have been asked about who would have considered and advised POL

   whether the Briefing Reports needed to be disclosed to SPMs convicted of

   theft, fraud or false accounting on the basis of data generated by the Horizon

   IT System.


109.      1 can see from the documents provided to me by the Inquiry that I was

   provided with a draft copy of the Briefing Report Part 2 (POL00021819) by

   Andrew Parsons of BD on 20th August 2014 (POL00021816). Andrew asked

   me or CK to review it to advise whether the report gave rise to criminal law /

   disclosure issues. I can see that I provided a holding response on 21st August

   2014 explaining that I was discussing it with CK and on 22     August 2014 1

   provided a further response explaining that "Martin [Smith] and Simon

  [Clarke]. . . advise that they would not propose any amendments to Rodric

  [Williams] letter"_ In relation to disclosure I went on to say `We [meaning

   Martin, Simon and t] cannot comment at this stage. We would wish to see

   final version of the report containing details of the enquiries being carried out

   and reasoned evidence conclusions, to enable use to make disclosure

   decisions". (POL00040239).



110.      1 had no involvement in the termination of SS's involvement.




111.      I have been asked to set out the nature and extent of my involvement

   in POL's response to journalists investigating allegations that the Horizon IT

   system lacked integrity. I recall having very limited involvement. Based on

     information provided to me by the Inquiry I can see that I was copied into an

     email chain (POL00169392) where POL was considering in early 2015

     whether to agree to an invitation to be interviewed for the BBC's Inside Out

     programme. Based on my review of this document I can see that I was asked

     on 8" January 2015 to input on one specific point relating to criminal appeals /

     criminal case reviews. In my response I can see that I am still referring to the

     SS Interim Report which does reinforce in my mind that I might not have seen

     the later 2014 SS Briefing Report Part 1. On review of my email i believe that I

     might have copied and pasted advice given by CK or possibly Brian Altman

     KC as the wording and language and grammar looks a little different to my

     usual email style. I may have spoken with CK before responding but I am not

     sure now whether I did. I believe that I was primarily concerned that POL

     needed to very carefully consider the content of public statements/interviews

     because, as above, I was continually concerned to ensure that POL met its

     disclosure obligations and I felt that CK as POL's external criminal lawyers

     should be involved in the discussion in relation to whether to give an interview

     and / or how it should respond to the BBC's interview questions. I copied my

     response to Jessica Madron as I recall that she became my line manager

     after Hugh Flemington left POL.



RESIGNATIONS

  112.      1 have asked why I think Chris Aujard left POL. To the best of my

     recollection he left after I did and I therefore do not know why he left.

GENERAL

  113.      At the time there was a clear belief that the Horizon system was robust

     which was a message reiterated through my time at RMG and POL, by the

     Head of Criminal Law (pre 2012) and subsequently by General Counsel (post

     2012). 1 do not believe that any individuals at RMG and / or POL knowingly

     withheld information from the legal team, but it may be that in some parts of

     the wider organisation there may have been information which was not known

     to us and which may have been relevant to criminal prosecution work. On

     reflection, I feel that the governance structures may not have been designed

     well enough to challenge assertions by individuals in senior positions

     regarding the robustness of Horizon.



  114.      When I first began working on POL prosecution cases in around 2007

     there was a clearly established process led by the Head of Criminal Law and

     two principal lawyers. On reflection, I do not feel that the prosecution process

     was designed well. I reflect on whether I should have realised or been aware

     of this, but I was the most junior of the qualified solicitors and don't believe 1

     would have been in a position to challenge. The head of criminal law team

     put the prosecution process in place, made the key decisions, for example in

     relation to criteria for acceptance of basis of pleas, and also held responsibility

     for reviewing the effectiveness of the overall process. What is clear to me now

     is that we needed independent review and challenge.



  115.      1 do not feel that I was particularly close to POL's response to SPMs,

     Members of Parliament, journalists and members of the public regarding


                                     Page 41 of 53
                                                                                           W ITN04750200
                                                                                         WITNO4750200




         challenges to the integrity of the Horizon IT System and therefore I do not feel

         in a position to reflect on the overall organisation's response.



   116.         In my role I leaned very heavily on CK as POL's external criminal

         lawyers, and to a much lesser extent on BD, once I began to have some

         interaction with them. I felt that the lawyers and counsel I dealt with at CK

         acted with integrity at all times in what became very challenging

         circumstances.



   117.         1 believe that advice was requested and given promptly and well-

         intentioned actions were put in place, in particular once the instruction of SS

         was known to those dealing with criminal cases in 2012 and Helen Rose

         became involved, and then again in 2013 in response to the Helen Rose

         Report and the SS Interim Report. I do not feel that I was sufficiently senior to

         have a true sense of whether the advice of the Legal Department was

         effectively provided to the business.




Statement of Truth

I believe the content of this statement to be true.
