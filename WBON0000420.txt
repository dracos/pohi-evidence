Hi Andy

Please see below the index to our instructions for Brian Altman.

Please could you arrange for this to be nicely formatted, and emailed back to me.

Please could you also arrange for a lever arch file to be set up with numbered tabs for each of the items in the
index and appropriate spine labelling (along the lines of “POL instructions to BAQC Feb 2016”). We can
fill the file, we just don’t have the stationery and folders! I would anticipate looking at the volume of paper,
that it would fit in one lever arch file. Please could the file and index be free from any BD branding. We
will need two copies of this file (filled with the numbered tabs) — one to keep here and one for Brian Altman.

Kind regards,

Elisa
