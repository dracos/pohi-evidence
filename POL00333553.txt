Dear Sir / Madam,

Disclosure for PPS

You may be aware that there has been recent publicity regarding the Horizon computer
system used by Post Office Ltd for accounting purposes. This system was referred to
during a BBC Panorama programme. There has also been televised coverage of a
number of parliamentary discussions. It is also in the public domain that a number of
convicted defendants have asked the CCRC to look into their cases. In these
circumstances we would ask that any Post Office related cases are referred to Amy Quirk
in order that she may review them and determine whether Post Office may have any
relevant information which may assist the PPS.

Yours sincerely,
Amy Cuirk

Amy Quirk
Senior Security Intelligence Manager
