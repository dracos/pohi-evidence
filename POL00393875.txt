Customer Management

5.1 Horizon Service Review Forum

This section outlines the agreed terms of reference for the Horizon Service Review
Forum.

The nature, extent and associated performance of the services provided by ICL
Pathway are specified in the Related Agreements. These contracts must always be
used as the definitive source of information and interpretation of the contracted
service.

At a lower level, the DSS, POCL and ICL Pathway have jointly developed a Service
Management Framework to support working level co-operation and day to day
control of the live service environment. The framework establishes a structure of
core functions and control mechanisms to underpin the effective management of an
end to end service.

The Horizon Service Review Forum is a key element of the overall Service
Management Framework.

5.1.1 Horizon Service Review Forum

The Horizon Service Review Forum provides a regular opportunity for senior
managers from the DSS, POCL and ICL Pathway to meet, review and discuss the
overall performance of ICL Pathways systems and services in the live environment.

The forum is a tripartite event to provide focus upon the mutual interests of the
DSS, POCL and ICL Pathway. However, from time to time there may be separate
review meetings between the DSS or POCL and ICL Pathway to review and discuss
matters of exclusive interest, for example, AP and EPOSS services.

The Horizon Service Review Forum is concerned with maintaining satisfactory levels
of service at an operational and practical level. Separate forums exist to consider,
decide upon and escalate matters of a contractual/commercial nature, that is, the
Contract Administration Groups and Contracts Steering Group. If any contractual or
commercial issues do arise at the Horizon Service Review Forum, the details are
noted and referred on to the appropriate forum for consideration, discussion and
determination.

5.1.2 Context of Meetings

The Horizon Service Review Forum addresses all facets of the ICL Pathway
contracted services, primarily focusing upon

1. Review of Performance Reports and relevant Management Information Statistics
(MIS).

1. Quantitative and qualitative assessment of the services.

1. Review of major incidents and/or significant outstanding problems.

1. Matters escalated from the DSS or POCL internal Service Review processes.

1. Review of impending changes or enhancements to the live service environment.
1. Development and monitoring of service improvement initiatives.

1. Implementation Requirements (non Roll-Out)

A typical agenda for the Horizon Service Review Forum appears in the DSS Agreement
Schedules D5 & E5 and POCL Agreement Schedules D5, E5, F5, G7, HS

5.1.3. Frequency of Meetings

5.1.3.1 Each Month

It is recognised that the Related Agreements formally provide for quarterly Service
Review meetings. However, for the time being it is anticipated that the Horizon
Service Review Forum will meet on a monthly basis. This reflects the early and
evolving state of the live environment. The monthly meeting will normally be within
10 working days of ICL Pathway publishing their Performance Reports and MIS
data. Other meetings may be arranged on an ad-hoc basis.

5.1.3.2 Every Third Month

Prior to each third monthly meeting, ICL Pathway will also provide information about
the level of any remedies applicable during the preceding service period. The
circumstances which have given rise to the performance deficiencies will be
considered at the Horizon Service Review Forum and output in the form of a report
to the Contract Administration Group(s).

5.1.4 Attendees

5.1.4.1 DSS and POCL

Both the DSS and POCL have each appointed/empowered a Business Manager
and Liaison Manager to undertake Service Management functions. The respective
roles and responsibilities of these individuals are detailed in the DSS Agreement
Schedules D5 & E5 and POCL Agreement Schedules D5, E5, F5, G7, H5. The
Business Manager(s) will attend the Horizon Service Review Forum and may be
accompanied by other DSS/POCL personnel as necessary.

5.1.4.2 ICL Pathway

ICL Pathway will appoint/empower an Operational Service Manager, Service
Manager and Service Help Desk Manager to undertake Service Management
functions The respective roles and responsibilities of these individuals are detailed
in the DSS Agreement Schedules D5 & E5 and POCL Agreement Schedules D5,
E5, F5, G7, H5. The Operational Service Manager will attend the Horizon Service
Review Forum and may be accompanied by other ICL Pathway personnel as
necessary.

5.1.5 Current Constitutions

The present constitution of the Horizon Service Review Forum is as shown in the
block diagram that follows.

Relationship between the Horizon Service Review Forum and Contract
Management Groups

The Horizon Service Review Forum supports and informs the Contract Management
function. The forum has no authority to take decisions of a contractual or
commercial nature. The associated Contract Management function is outlined in
Schedules A4 to the Authorities Agreement, DSS Agreement and POCL
Agreement.

The Horizon Service Review Forum provides reports to the Contract Administration
and Contracts Steering Groups for contract monitoring purposes and the
consideration or determination of any contractual issues. In particular, the Contract
Administration Groups considers the overall performance of ICL Pathway services
for the purpose of invoice authorisation and the application of remedies where
appropriate.

Preliminary Activities

Following receipt of the ICL Pathway monthly Performance and MIS reporting pack
both the DSS and POCL conduct their own internal Service Review meetings.
Separate terms of reference exist within each organisation for these forums. In
general, the meetings provide an opportunity for representatives from a variety of
business units and working groups in the DSS and POCL to:

1. Review the ICL Pathway performance and MIS reports

1. Discuss the prioritisation, progress and resolution of outstanding problems
1. Facilitate operational feedback about the contracted services

1. Review Service Management processes and procedures

1. Identify improvement opportunities

Service Operations Manual Version: 0.2
Date: 29/06/98

The internal Service Review meetings are normally chaired by the respective
Liaison Managers and the ICL Pathway Service Manager is usually invited to attend.
Counterparts from the other organisations Service Management team may also be
invited on a regular or ad hoc basis. The full Horizon Service Review Forum
provides a primary route for the escalation of matteres that cannot be resolved at
the DSS and POCL internal Service Review meetings

Following the internal Service Review meetings the DSS and POCL Business
Managers are briefed by their respective Liaison Managers. Subsequently, the two
Business Managers will meet in advance of the full Horizon Service Review Forum
to highlight and discuss matters of mutual interest or concern.

The target timeframe for preliminary activities leading up to the Horizon Service
Review Forum is shown in the following diagram.

6.1.2.1

Customer Satisfaction

The customer satisfaction functions of Customer Support are concerned with the
following:

« Service Visit Record (SVR) cards

e Satisfaction surveys, and

« Management care visits

Service Visit Records (SVR) cards

This section defines the procedure by which Service Visit Records (SVRs) are
distributed to Horizon users, that is, Postmasters or Sub-Postmasters. The
feedback card allows the Postmaster to comment briefly on the quality of the service
provided by an engineer during his visit, including any related contact through the
Horizon System Helpdesk (HSH). The card is then received, analysed and action is
then taken by ICL Pathway according to the content of the card.

SVR Production

ICL Pathway are responsible for the initial design and production of the SVR, plus
any subsequent updates or amendments. A sample SVR is given at the end of this
section.

The feedback section of the SVR is reply-paid. The Royal Mail invoice Pathway for
the cost of the reply-paid service.
SVR Distribution

Within ICL

ICL Pathway arrange for batches of SVRs to be printed and then provide them to
the SORBUS SVR Co-ordinator for distribution to their engineers.

ICL Pathway process new orders for batches of SVRs on request by the SORBUS
SVR Co-ordinator.

6.1.2.2 Within Post Offices

Each time a SORBUS engineer visits a Post Office, he completes the front sheet of
the SVR and obtain a signature from the Postmaster verifying irs content. The
engineer then retains the top copy, leaving a copy of the SVR and attached
Feedback Card with the Postmaster. The Postmaster should keep the SVR copy for
his records and then complete the feedback card and return it to ICL Pathway.

SORBUS and CFM have a similar internal procedure for handling the SVRs that
complements the ICL Pathway procedure described here (see document Reference
ICLS/PATHWAYUKSS).

SVR Analysis

The Feedback Card asks seven brief questions about the service provided by
SORBUS or CFM. Against each question the Postmaster need only tick a box for
Yes, No or, where relevant, N/A. There is also space for brief comments. Each card
has a unique serial number.

When returned to ICL, the card is received in the central mail room of the ICL
Pathway office in Feltham (FEL 01). Itis then delivered to the Customer Service

department and passed to the Customer Satisfaction Manager for entry into a
database, which is updated daily.

The database holds all the information from the feedback cards, as follows:
Unique serial number

Date Call No.
Contact Name Position
Post Office FAD Code
Postcode Tel No
Service Provided by Service Unit
Arrival Completion

Yes, No or N/A response against each of the seven questions
Free text comments or suggestions
The free text comments may relate to SORBUS engineers or the HSH.

There is a field in the database for SORBUS or HSH responses, for actions taken
by them, plus a date column for when the response was received from them.

A field entitled Action Required is also available to help the ICL Pathway Customer
Satisfaction Manager note any additional actions required.

6.1.3.1 Individual Card Analysis

Immediately after entering the data from each feedback card into the database,
those which show one or more No responses to any of the questions, or have
negative comments/ suggestions, are electronically extracted and converted to a
Word document as a single SVR. These are sent to the SORBUS SVR Co-
ordinator, or the CFM Horizon System Helpdesk Manager, according to who the
particular issue relates.

SORBUS or CFM then investigate the issue and takes appropriate corrective action,
in accordance with their own internal procedure. This includes contacting the
Postmaster directly to obtain further details. Once resolved, SORBUS or CFM
should contact the Postmaster to confirm resolution of the issue.

Details of the cause of the issue and the action taken are entered on the electronic
SVR, and noted as complete. The completed SVR is then returned electronically to
ICL Pathway Customer Satisfaction by the SORBUS SVR Co-ordinator, or the CFM
Horizon System Helpdesk Manager, within 10 working days of receipt. For issues of
a more serious nature, best endeavours must be made to return the completed
electronic SVR within five working days.

The ICL Pathway Customer Satisfaction Manager then updates the database with
details of the returned, completed SVRs.

The ICL Pathway Customer Satisfaction Manager must contact either the SORBUS
SVR Co-ordinator or the CFM Horizon System Helpdesk Manager, immediately, if
an SVR is not completed within 10 working days, to establish the reason for the
delay and to agree a satisfactory method of resolution.

6.1.3.2 Top Level Analysis

Routine, monthly analysis is performed giving basic statistics, as follows:

1. Percentage of feedback cards returned compared with total visits made. A
figure for the total number of visits made in the month is obtained from SORBUS

and entered onto the spreadsheet.
1. Percentage of positive and negative responses by question.
1. Comments on key areas of satisfaction, or dissatisfaction.
The SORBUS SVR Co-ordinator and the CFM Helpdesk Manager receive a copy of
the report every month.
Review Meetings

Review meetingsare held monthly between the ICL Pathway Customer Satisfaction
Manager, SORBUS SVR Co-ordinator and CFM Helpdesk Manager.

These meetings are part of a general ‘satisfaction’ review, but specific to the SVR
procedure. They ensure that correct procedures are adhered to, that statistics are
analysed, that all necessary actions have been taken, that outstanding issues have
been dealt with, or that a plan of action is agreed.

Back-up Of Historical Data

Hard copies of the Feedback Cards are filed in numerical order by ICL Pathway and
held for a period of six months before they are destroyed.

The electronic data (database) is held on hard disk and backed-up onto diskette.
The data is held for three years before being destroyed.
Charitable Donations

ICL Pathway make a donation to charity for every feedback card returned. The
amount and charity chosen by ICL Pathway may change from time to time.

Satisfaction Surveys

This section defines the Procedure by which Post Office Counters Limited (POCL)
Research Department prepare for and carry out User Satisfaction Surveys during
the implementation of releases 1b and 1c of the Horizon system. This section also
explains how the survey results are documented and reported back to ICL Pathway
for action, as appropriate.

Initial Preparation

The basic actions consist of preparing a project plan for all activities, including dates
for each task. Also, performing initial Focus events, targeting a small cross section
of Users to help compile questionnaires for broader telephone surveys.

POCL Research Services and ICL Pathway meet whenever required during the
course of the project to communicate progress or resolve issues. No set dates are
established, and the meetings occur as and when necessary. However, results
from the Focus Events are presented at the Satisfaction Forum.

The Project Plan

A colour coded plan is produced and maintained by POCL Research Services. It
indicates when Go Ahead for the activity is to be approved by the PDA, when the
fieldwork is to be expedited and when the results are due.

The above details apply to each release stage of 1b and 1c of the Horizon
implementation.

Focus Events

A Focus event is a meeting chaired by POCL Research Services. It is attended by
asmall number of Postmasters, picked by POCL Research Services, who are at an
appropriate stage in the implementation of Horizon. There are normally eight
Postmasters at each event. Four Focus events are held in quick succession in
towns located within the chosen geographical implementation areas, for example,
Bristol and Newcastle.

With input from ICL Pathway a discussion document is assembled by POCL
Research Services which is used as an informal script to help ensure all relevant
topics are covered during the event. However, the events are designed to allow the
Postmasters to air their views on any aspect of the implementation or services of
Horizon if they feel it is relevant. It is the Chairman’s responsibility to ensure that all
the topics are covered and the meeting keeps to the agenda.

The results of the Focus events will be used to develop a more specific
questionnaire which will form a telephone survey of a further 100 Post Office sites.

Telephone Surveys

Using the data gathered during the Focus events, a telephone questionnaire was
generated by POCL Research Services. This questionnaire is much more formal,
and is performed by an independent, outside agency. The telephone surveys are
timed to be carried out once the planned 190 sites for Release 1b have been
implemented. The whole procedure, from Focus event to telephone survey, is
started from scratch for Release 1c.

Areas Covered By Surveys

The initial Focus events are designed to be informal, but the event should address
the following areas:

These topics will again be used to compile the more scripted telephone surveys.

Survey Results

The results of the Focus events, may themselves indicate problem areas that
require immediate and specific corrective action, or areas where customer
satisfaction has been particularly positive.

The results of the telephone surveys give a more comprehensive and specific
analysis of a much larger cross section of Horizon users. Again these results
enable ICL Pathway to pinpoint specific areas of concern or satisfaction and take
relevant action.

The ICL Pathway Customer Satisfaction Manager receive the reports of both the
Focus event and telephone surveys, and instigate and co-ordinate any required
actions.

The Horizon users are contacted with regard to the general results of the surveys
and the sort of actions that will be taken, when appropriate.

The appropriate methods of communication with users, suppliers and internally, will
be considered on receipt of the survey results.

Management Care Visits

In order to monitor the user’s perception of ICL Pathway’s Post Implementation
Customer Service, Customer Service manage the Management Care Visit
Programme (MCVP). The MCVP involves senior ICL Pathway representatives
visiting selected post offices and collecting feedback using a predefined interview
pack.

Purpose

The purpose of the MCVP is to monitor the user’s perception of ICL Pathway’s Post
Implementation Customer Service. The interviews allow ICL Pathway to gain an
understanding of the user’s (Postmasters) problems, concerns, suggestions and
good news. Where and when relevant ICL Pathway can act upon this information
as an aid to resolving problems, taking pre-emptive action and learning from good
news and positive feedback.

This programme is non-contractual, and is managed within the Customer Service
department of ICL Pathway.

The MCVP is performed annually, with visits around 500 Post Offices per year after
full roll out of the programme (1999 onwards). Until that time a small number of
Post Offices will be visited in Q4 of 1997 and around 200 in 1998. Cumulative
analysis is carried out internally on a monthly basis, and results published quarterly.

A number of relevant senior ICL Pathway representatives have been selected to
carry out the interviews, hereafter known as the interviewers.

Training

The Customer Satisfaction Manager presents the details of the procedure to the
interviewers before they have contact with any Post Offices regarding the
interviews.

The purpose and the goals of the MCVP are presented. The interview procedure
and questionnaire are explained in detail and the interview process is established.
All other relevant documentation is presented, and any questions or concerns raised
by the interviewers are addressed.

Section 9 of this document is the Interviewer’s Summary Guide, which is designed
to be copied and used as a reference guide during the interviews.

It is important for the interviewers to understand why each interview must follow a
standard procedure, to ensure all results can be fairly compared and a true analysis
obtained.

Preparations And Documentation

The interviewers are sent electronic copies of relevant documentation, plus hard
copy ‘Interview Packs’ containing all relevant reference documentation, which
should be maintained by the interviewers,. These packs must be taken to the
interviews.

The Interview Packs contain the Procedure document (including Interviewer’s
Summary Guide), Phone Script, sample forms and documents (referred to in the
questionnaire), the Questionnaire and the list of Post Offices to be contacted.

Before contacting the Post Offices, the interviewers must familiarise themselves with
recent Horizon System Helpdesk call history. The call history should be assessed to
check that there is no reason why the Post Offices should not be contacted now to
arrange a visit. The decision not to visit a particular post office will be made by the

Customer Satisfaction Manager (or nominated representative).

Arranging Appointments

Once the list of Post Offices has been received by each interviewer, he or she can
start to arrange the visits, after first requesting and having the Horizon System call
history checked by the Customer Satisfaction Manager.

Details of the Post Offices, FAD Code, Address, Phone Number and Contact Name
are supplied to the interviewers. Each list is personalised for each interviewer, only
containing the Post Offices to be visited by that interviewer.

The interviewers should first familiarise themselves with the Phone Script (Ref:
MCVP 97/script.doc) and then telephone the Post Offices, using the script, to
arrange the appointments.

As each visit is arranged details of the Post Office and appointment must be sent to
the Customer Satisfaction Manager for entry onto an Appointments Database.

The interviewers must ensure the Post Offices have a contact number and the
interviewer's name so that they can contact the interviewer should a problem arise
with the arranged appointment. If an interviewer is, in general, difficult to contact
they should leave the contact number for the Customer Satisfaction Manager as an
alternative.

The interviews should always be arranged at a time to suit the Post Office. This
may involve a lunch time, or in some cases an evening meeting. The interviewers
should also stress that the interviews need take no more than half an hour, but that
there is no time limit applied.

If the interviews are arranged significantly in advance (more than 10 days) the
interviewer should contact the Post Office nearer the visit (no more than 2 days
before) to confirm it can still go ahead.

It is up to the interviewers to obtain directions to the Post Offices.

The Interview

Before going to the Post Offices the interviewers must familiarise themselves with
the questionnaire.

The questionnaire has eleven sections. Before commencing with Section 1
onwards the interviewers should explain a little more about the purpose and
objectives of the visit, as stated in the notes on the front sheet of the questionnaire.

Section 1

This section can be pre-filled, where possible, before the interview, to save time.
However, all information must be checked with the interviewees before moving on to
the next section.

Section 2

The interviewers should gain a very brief understanding of how the implementation
of the Post Office went in general. This will not form part of the statistics, but it will
help ICL Pathway understand if any implementation experiences have influenced
the subsequent views of the interviewees, either positively or negatively.

Sections 3 to 10

All the answers to the questions in these sections are analysed. There is an ‘N/A’
(Not Applicable) option for each question, but it should be avoided if at all possible.
When asking each question the interviewers should read out the positive and

COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Page 24 of 104
POL00393875
POL00393875

ICL Pathway ICL Pathway Customer Service: Customer Ref: CS/MAN/004

Service Operations Manual Version: 0.2
Date: 29/06/98

6.3.6

negative answer options, and only then offer ‘N/A’ if it appears unavoidable.

Where ‘N/A’s are recorded the number of Post Offices that can be analysed against
that question is reduced, thus giving a smaller sample of Post Offices’ views.

The interviewers must mark the boxes appropriate to the answers given. The
interviewers must not suggest answers or influence answers in any way, other than
to try to avoid ‘N/A’ answers where possible. The interviewer must ensure the
interviewees understand the questions fully before they answer.

There is an opportunity for the interviewees to comment further on the response
given to each question. The interviewers should ask if there are any comments
after each question is answered.

It is especially important to get comments when the questions have a negative
answer. This helps ICL Pathway to understand the reasons behind the negative
comments, and thus enables them to take any possible corrective action, either
generically or for a single Post Office, if relevant.

Section 11

This section gives the interviewees a chance to express any concerns, problems or
suggestions for improvement to the Horizon system or services. The interviewers
should also encourage any positive comments or experiences the interviewees can
share. This helps to keep this section balanced.

At this point the interviewers should try to engage general conversation in order to
get opinions free flowing and less ‘closed’ than those given during the
questionnaire, but remembering to keep the conversation relevant to the purpose of
the interviews, that is, about the service provided after implementation.

Questions such as:
‘What else would you want ICL Pathway to do to improve services?

What sort of things do we do well and what sort of things do we need to improve
on?’

If the interviewees ask any questions, the interviewers should note them down and
explain that they are not in a position to answer any specific questions as part of the
interview process. If required an ICL Pathway representative could contact the
interviewees at a later time to respond to any specific questions. These questions
should be noted down in Section 11 or in the additional notes area.

At the end of Section 11 the interviewers must ask whether the interviewees are
willing to be contacted again, if necessary, after the interview results are analysed.
The interviewers must delete either the ‘willing’ or ‘unwilling’ part of the statement
accordingly.

The interviews can then be terminated. The interviewers should remember to thank
the interviewees for their time and co-operation, and then leave the premises.

Follow Up Letters

As soon after the visit as possible the interviewers should write to the interviewees
confirming the main points of the interview, to ensure there is no future controversy
or misunderstanding about the information provided by the interviewees.

The first and last paragraphs of the letter are supplied as a standard. The middle
section of the letter is a summary of the interview, as compiled by the interviewers.
This does not need to include details about sections 3 to 10 of the questionnaire,
but should cover the information provided for sections 1, 11 and any additional
notes made.

Feedback Reports

The completed questionnaires and reports must be treated as confidential within ICL
Pathway. They must be kept securely until they can be passed on to the Customer
Satisfaction Manager, as quickly as possible.

The results of the questionnaires are entered on to an analysis spreadsheet (see
document reference MCVP 97/analysis97.xls). The FAD code is used as the unique
reference for each completed questionnaire. The hard copies are filed securely in
numerical order by FAD code. Any questions, concerns or required actions logged
are recorded against the FAD code.

Analysis

Pre-designed graphs reflect Positive, Very Positive, Negative, Very Negative results
for each section, from 3 to 10.

A report is produced monthly showing graphs with the cumulative results to date and
a brief summary on each section's results. Relevant information from Section 11,
and any additional notes, is also summarised. This report is for limited distribution
within ICL Pathway.

A quarterly report is produced, similar to the monthly reports, which reflects the
cumulative, quarterly results. There will also be further recommendations for action
on feedback of note.

Results are formally published internally each quarter. The most appropriate
method of publication is decided at the relevant time.

The quarterly report is presented to the PDA, via the Satisfaction Forum.

General publication to all Post Offices is expected to be a brief write-up, using the
most appropriate method of publication, which is decided at the relevant time.

Concerns, suggestions or comments which require further action are recorded
separately on the spreadsheet as a log for action. The FAD code, name of the
Post Office, and details of the comments are noted, and any actions taken can be
recorded. The record is kept open until a satisfactory conclusion is reached. The
action can then be marked as closed. The Customer Satisfaction Manager
maintains and manages the log.

The Post Offices is only contacted to follow up any feedback if they agreed at the
interview to further contact and then, only when considered necessary by ICL
Pathway.

this information with the interviewees before moving on to Section2. Make sure
your handwriting is always legible.

Just get any points of note regarding the implementation work, as it may have a
bearing on how the interviewees respond to the questionnaire. If nothing out of the
ordinary happened during implementation and the interviewees appear fine about it,
just enter OK in Section 2.

Do not rush the questions. Make sure the interviewees understand each question
before giving an answer. Read out the four positive and negative options available
as answers. Only volunteer the N/A option if you see no alternative

Horizon System Helpdesk

Overview

The Horizon System Helpdesk (HSH), provides Post Office Counters Ltd counter
staff with a single point of contact for dealing with all problems relating to the
Horizon IT equipment installed on the counter. Additionally it provides a single point
of contact for technical interface queries from DSS (CAPS) staff via the ITSA
Service Helpdesk IBDN: POCL Interface still to be agreed by POCLI. Any calls received
that are inappropriate to this helpdesk are re-directed to the appropriate service
point, if sufficient information is available.

Horizon System Helpdesk information

related to the ICL Pathway environment or the data feeds into ICL Pathway from
Post Office Counters Ltd (POCL) and their clients such as DSS (CAPS) or DVLA
(TIP). It provides a single point of contact for counter staff, ICL Pathway operation
staff and POCL clients such as DSS (CAPS), for ICL Pathway-related incidents. All
incidents reported to the HSH from outside of the Pathway environment are sent via
a client service desk, for example, DSS incidents that affect the ICL Pathway
environment are sent via the ITSA Service Helpdesk.

Skeleton Service 0500 - 0800 Monday to Saturday
Skeleton Service 2000 - 2400 Monday to Saturday
Skeleton Service 0700 - 2200 Sunday
The service is not provided on English Bank Holidays.
During these hours of operation, all calls are handled by Pathway operators with the
telephone equipment relaying messages to callers in exceptional circumstances, for
instance when call volumes exceed the telephone system limits.
8.2.3. Contacting the Horizon System Helpdesk
8.2.3.1 Call validation
The HSH is available to receive calls from any of its authorised sources and takes
calls that are described on the HSH Call Enquiry Matrix. When the HSH is
contacted, the helpdesk operator asks several questions in order to verify the
caller's identity and to ascertain the nature of the problem. These include name,
post office FAD or site code (where applicable) and details of the problem.
Before calling the helpdesk the caller should gather as much information as possible
to enable the helpdesk operator to diagnose the nature of the problem quickly.
8.2.3.2 Call logging

The operator attempts to resolve or diagnose the problem during this initial
telephone call. The information is recorded onto a helpdesk system and allocated a
unique call reference number.

Once the problem has been diagnosed the operator informs the caller of the call
identity number and what action to expect next. This identity number should be
recorded by the caller and quoted if the caller needs to ring the helpdesk about this
problem again.

If the customer's query/problem is not resolved within the initial telephone call, the
helpdesk advise the customer the date/time by which they will next receive contact.
This contact will take the form of either a site visit by an engineer or a telephone call
from someone in the Pathway support chain.

8.2.3.3 One-shot password verification procedure

If the caller requires emergency password access, the HSH verifies the caller's
identity using agreed procedures, before issuing the emergency password.

The One Shot Password (OSP) facility is only available to Office Managers or
Supervisors, selected Regional Managers and auditors. Each person authorised to
use the OSP service is registered and undergoes a verification procedure before a
password is provided.

[DN: The verification procedure will be inserted here when agreed (CP1172).1

8.2.3.4 Third party calls

All incidents affecting the Horizon BPS and OBCS services, occurring in the DSS
environment must be reported to the ITSA Service Helpdesk. (The ITSA SHD is the
service point for all DSS IT calls. It is owned and managed by the DSS and provides
a single interface for issues that cross the boundary between DSS and ICL
Pathway.) Incidents reported from the ITSA SHD into the HSH are allocated a
reference number and subjected to the same call handling and escalation
procedures as for other calls. If calls are received direct from the DSS environment,
that is, not from the ITSA SHD, these are re-directed as described in Section 8.2.3.6
Call redirecting.

Similarly, incidents affecting the EPOSS, APS or reference data services that arise
in the POCL environment are also reported to the HSH in accordance to agreed
procedures.

[DN : Interfaces into POCL still not known or agreed. This issue is being driven by POCL
Product Management)

In the event of an unplanned post office closure, the affected post office contacts
the POCL Regional Helpdesk and informs them. The POCL Regional Helpdesk then
contacts the HSH on behalf of the affected post office to register an incident. The
POCL Regional Helpdesk operator quotes the post office FAD code, their name and
telephone number and the nature of the problem (see the NR2 Operating
Environment PPD [Ref. CS/PRO/0024)].

8.2.3.5 Call escalation

The HSH system manages each call throughout its life and alerts the HSH
supervisors should the helpdesk service levels approach or pass minimum SLA
levels. A manual escalation and alert procedure ensure timely escalation into ICL
Pathway, its suppliers, Post Office Counters Ltd and DSS. The escalation procedure
utilises a problem manager at a predetermined point. The problem manager is
responsible for ensuring that the correct management and resources are in place to
resolve the problem and restore the service levels. The problem manager is
supported by an escalation process that covers the BA, ITSA, Post Office Counters
Ltd and ICL Pathway organisations in case any disputes of ownership and
responsibility arise.

8.2.3.6 Call redirecting

The HSH retains responsibility for resolution and escalation of the call. Calls that
cannot be resolved in the initial phone call are passed electronically to support
specialists for resolution. All calls raised in the HSH are subject to SLA timings to
ensure that failures in the operation are resolved as quickly as possible. Should the
HSH receive calls that are not applicable to the service provided by that helpdesk,
they are re-routed to the appropriate helpdesk. Should the HSH receive calls that

are for another Pathway helpdesk, such calls are re-directed via telephony links
between the two helpdesks. If the HSH receives calls for another authority's
helpdesk, the helpdesk operator advises the caller to ring the appropriate number.
Where possible the helpdesk operator supplies the phone number of the
appropriate desk.

8.2.3.7 Contingency

8.2.4

8.2.4.1

For contingency purposes, the helpdesk service is provided from two sites. These
sites are geographically separated, but linked by common computer and telephony
systems. In normal operation the service is provided from one site with a second site
being used to deal with over-spill at peak times. Should the first site become unable
to operate, the second site takes over. Depending on the nature and extent of the
problem, there may be a period of around two hours during which only a reduced
service is possible. In the extreme situation of neither site being able to provide the
helpdesk service, the telephone lines would be directed to respond to callers with a
pre-recorded message.

PO outlet incidents
This section gives descriptions of the calls that may be received by the HSH from
PO counter staff.

PO hardware incidents

The calls that may be received from PO counter staff about hardware incidents are
as follows:

Call ref Description

POHCO1 Hardware incidents may be logged by the Post Master or counter

to staff if a problem arises in using the equipment installed at the
POHC12 counter.

and Pan , -
PCHC15 Should such a situation occur, the caller rings the HSH to gain access

to suitable support. The caller is required to make a note of the
activity being performed when the problem arose, before the
helpdesk is called.

In the event of a Counter PC system failure or a peripheral failure, the
HSH allocates an engineer to attend the post office. The caller is told
when the engineer is expected to arrive.

The engineer normally carry spare parts with him; however
occasionally spare parts may need to be sent by courier to the post
Office. In this instance, the engineer will be scheduled to arrive shortly
after the spare part has been delivered. The post office is informed in
advance to expect a spare part to be delivered. Once at the post
office the engineer replaces the faulty part, tests its operation and
then checks that the Post Master is happy that the system is now
operational. The engineer must remove any broken equipment when
he leaves.

For more details see the NR2 Operating Environment PPD [Ref.
CS/PRO/0024].

POHC16 Post offices that have equipment destroyed or damaged should
contact the HSH who will deal with the call in the same way as a
hardware incident. If equipment is damaged the engineer completes
a report on the circumstances surrounding the damage which must

Software problems can arise in the form of an error message
displayed on the screen or during the use of the system when
something fails to work correctly. Counter staff should record any
messages appearing on the screen or details of what activity was
being undertaken at the time of the problem and appraise the
helpdesk operator of these messages and actions. Details of the
incident are captured by the HSH operators, who determine the
nature of the problem, allocate a call identification number and inform
the caller of the next expected action. If the problem has occurred
before and has been previously resolved, the operator issues
instructions to the caller to help them to circumvent the problem, or
alternatively the helpdesk operator may attempt to resolve the
problem by repeating the process on the HSH reference system.

If the problem requires a more technical solution, the incident is
passed into the ICL Pathway support organisation. The incident is
then investigated and a workaround or resolution applied. The
support technicians may contact the caller to understand the incident
circumstance more fully, or to gather more evidence to assist the
investigation.

8.2.6 Security incidents

This section gives descriptions of the calls that may be received by the HSH relating
to security incidents.

Call ref

Description

SEC001

Post offices that have equipment stolen must follow existing Post
Office Counters Ltd procedures to report the theft, that is, contact the
Police and Post Office Counters Ltd Regional Helpdesk. ICL Pathway
must replace the stolen equipment once the incident has been
reported to the HSH by the Regional Helpdesk. If the counter and the
ICL Pathway wiring are undamaged, ICL Pathway must arrange for
the counter system to be re-equipped quickly to bring the post office
back into operation. However, work may have to be scheduled to
correct any physical damage and this must be arranged at a suitable
time and agreed with the Post Master.

SEC002

Each time a PC is powered on the Post Master must perform the Post
Office Log On (POLO) procedure. The Post Master is issued with a
PMMC card plus a spare and PIN when the equipment is installed.
This card and PIN must be kept in a secure location and used when
the equipment is powered on after being switched off as described in
the NR2 Access Control and User Administration PPD [Ref.
CS/PRO/0025].

If the card or PIN is lost, the Post Master must ring the HSH. The
helpdesk operator will ask a series of questions to verify the identity
of the caller and then pass the caller on to a supervisor. The
supervisor then assists the Post Master to generate a new PIN or
allocates a PIN to the spare card. This process involves the Post
Master following verbal instructions from the HSH Supervisor. In
extreme cases where the system cannot generate the PIN number
easily the Post Master is taken through the underlying recovery
process that involves typing a series of letters and numbers into the
Horizon system and takes approximately twenty minutes to complete.

The new PIN must be stored securely as instructed in the NR2
Access Control and User Administration PPD [Ref. CS/PRO/0025],
and in the case of a lost card the one card will be invalidated and a
replacement card is ordered for issue to the post office.

SEC003

Passwords within an office are controlled by the Office Manager or
supervisor and if a member of staff loses or forgets his or her
password the Office Manager can reset it. If the Office Manager loses
or forgets his or her password an emergency password can be issued
by the HSH using the One Shot Password service (OSP). Audit staff
also need access to the system and require use of the OSP service
to gain access. Each person authorised to use this service is pre-
registered and has to undergo a verification procedure before access
to the OSP service is permitted.

IDN: The verification procedure is still not agreed [¢P 117211

Once verified the caller has to enter the OSP service on the counter
system and is issued with a password which is valid for only one
session. (Further information on system access using one-shot
passwords is given in the NR2 Access Control and User
Administration PPD [Ref. CS/PRO/0025])

The Horizon system monitors and records unsuccessful,
unauthorised attempts to access the system. These are investigated

by POCL and Pathway security.

SECO00S

If the Post Master or any Post Office Counters Ltd staff discover or
suspect that any part of the Horizon system or environment presents
a Safety risk, it must be reported immediately to the HSH. The
helpdesk must instruct the caller to switch off any electrical
equipment, or take any necessary remedial action until an engineer
can attend the affected site. When the engineer arrives on site he will
assess the situation and take appropriate action to remove the risk.

SEC007

If the Post Master or Post Office Counters Ltd representative
suspects a security breach, for example, passwords have become
known to an unauthorised person, the Horizon system has been
tampered with, or someone suspects their user information has been
used without their knowledge, the HSH must be informed
immediately. The helpdesk must immediately inform the ICL Pathway
Security Unit who will begin investigations. The caller may be
contacted during this investigation and is advised to make notes of
the circumstances surrounding the suspected security breach. ICL
Pathway may remove any system access at this point and the post
office may be prevented from using the system until authorisation is
given.

the call. Calls are not passed on to specialists, unlike calls to the HSH. However,
should the helpdesk receive calls which are appropriate for both the Payment Card
Helpline and the HSH, then on completion of the Payment Card Helpline call, the
Payment Card Helpline should endeavour to transfer the call to the Horizon
Helpdesk, via the telephony link between the two helpdesks. If the Payment Card
Helpline receives calls for another authority's helpdesk, the helpdesk operator
should advise the caller to ring the appropriate number. Where possible the
helpdesk operator should supply the phone number of the appropriate desk.

Operational Business Change

ICL Pathway provides services to implement standard changes, as defined in the
contractual change service matrix. Standard changes are those that can be
identified and prepared for in advance, and that do not require software code
changes. Many of these changes are supported by changes to reference data.
Standard changes are either related to POCL Outlets, for example, relocating an
office, or to the Products sold at POCL Outlets, for example, changing the price of
stamps.

14.1 Operational Business Change - Outlets

A Change Proposal/Request is raised to include the change service matrix as a
contractual document, together with the mechanism for using these processes to by-
pass the Change Request process for standard steady state changes.

The volume of change covered by the contract is declared in the Authorities
Schedule A06 [8]. Thereafter, all outlet changes are chargeable.

14.1.1 Change types
Outlet changes are categorised into the following types.

14.1.1.1 Delayed opening
Closed for less than one day and Pathway are not informed.
Note: The postmaster MUST complete the End of Day procedures.

14.1.1.2 Emergency closure
Minimal notice is given of closure and it can only be temporary arrangement.
The closure may last from less than one day, up to the point that an alternative
Nominated Post Office is available or the office re-opens or permanently closes.
14.1.1.3 Simple re-opening
It only applies following an emergency closure when no site visit or data change is
needed before re-opening.
14.1.1.4 Standard closure
All non-emergency closures. Notice is given. All permanent closures are standard.

14.1.1.5 Refurbishment (same counter configuration)
Office closes, Pathway remove & relocate same equipment.

14.1.1.6 Open/Relocation/ Refurbishment (new counter configuration)
Re-opening where site visit (including refurbishment) or data change required.
New opening.
Relocation: move equipment etc from one site to another, with same FAD code.

14.1.1.7 Office Details

Details about the office change and Pathway need notice to implement the change
successfully (not FAD code).

14.1.1.8 Planned Outlet Reference Data
Data that supports changes to the information about the PO retail network.

14.1.1.9 Outlet data only

Data that supports changes to the information about the PO retail network and does
not impact Pathway, can be implemented with no manual intervention by Pathway.

14.1.2 Card & payment management

Emergency and standard closures, refurbishment and relocation all require

processes for managing benefit cards and payments during outlet closures. The
closure types are as follows.

14.1.2.1 Temporary closures:
1. Short term Any duration when there is no alternative
NPO notified to Pathway
2. Medium Term Requires 1 days notice & expected for a

- no card re-issue closure of at least 3 days
3. Medium Term Requires 3 days notice & expected for a
- with card re-issue closure of 7 days or more.

14.1.2.2 Permanent closures require 2 weeks notice.

The result of a permanent closure is the permanent transfer of all beneficiaries from
the closing office to the alternative one and the removal of all equipment from site. If
a temporary closure lasts for a significant period of time, POCL may initiate
permanent closure procedures, or a subset of those procedures, for example,
transfer the beneficiaries and remove the counter terminal but do not remove the
ISDN connection.

These timescales are not restrictive, the availability of other information, for
example, alternative NPO is the defining factor. The times are indicative and POCL
may select whichever closure type is appropriate and in line with their agreement

with DSS. Pathway will implement the change as requested. (see ref 5 for further
details of payment methods during office closure).

Release 1c
These processes supersede the release 1c processes for outlet change [ref 7].
However the following points must be noted:

1. There is no medium term temporary closure process for card & payment
management at Release 1c.

1. Pathway can only install equipment for new openings or relocations if there is a
compliant counter, at Release 1c.

1. Reference data is sent manually from POCL to Pathway at Release 1c, only for
details about those offices involved in Release 1c, and is updated manually by
Pathway.

Operational Business Change - Product

14.2.1 Change Types

Product changes are categorised into the following types.

14.2.1.1 Product
Introduction of a new EPOSS product.

Changes to an existing EPOSS product, or changes to the way EPOSS works using
reference data, are subsets of this process. That is, the same process will be
followed to make changes, as are followed for introducing a new product, but not all
of the activities will apply.

14.2.1.2 AP Client Service
Introduction of a new Automated Payment Client Service (i.e. new AP product).

Changes to an existing AP product, or other AP information, are subsets of this

process. That is, the same process will be followed to make changes, as are

followed for introducing a new AP product, but not all of the activities will apply.
14.2.1.3 Data Only

These changes are a subset of the two above, but are singled out as they have no
impact on Pathway and can be implemented by changing the data with no manual
intervention by Pathway.
14.2.2 Top Level Processes - Product
The table below gives the top level view of the processes for product change.
The four elements of each changes are:
1. Management
1. Notification
1. Implementation
1. Acceptance

The services that make up each element are given, for the different change types.

Second Level Processes- Product

14.2.4.1 Error Management

Throughout these processes are references to [incident]. This indicates that that
action may raise an incident as part of the Reference Data Error Management/
Reconciliation process. This process is yet to be defined.

14.2.4.2 Terminology

The following processes include the term ‘system label’, this refers to the
mechanism of labelling all the files that belong to a change (CAN Number) in the
RDMC, so they can be realised as a single unit.
