Moderator: Okay, I'm resuming the interview. Um, it's 18:02 hours. Just before you sign that,
Carl, can I-, it's just procedure. Um, you've thrown me, now. We're at the same, err, interview
room, which is Hand Morgan & Owen at 17 Martin Street. Err, the same people are present. Err,
my name is Manish (ph 00.24) Patel and my colleague.

Patrick Farrington: Patrick Farrington.

(TC: 00:00:29)

Moderator: Okay. Err, Carl, I remind you, you remain under caution, that is you do not have to
say anything but it may harm your defence if you do not mention, when questioned, something
which you later rely on in court. Anything you do say may be given in evidence. Do you understand
that?

(TC: 00:00:41)
Carl: I do understand that. Yes, thank you.

(TC: 00:00:42)

Moderator: Okay, err, you're busily filling in that form there, our CS001. Um, I can see that
you've signed it all up. I will read out what, what it says so that there's no mistake as to what, err,
you're signing. Err, I remind you, this is a voluntary interview that you've agreed to, um, that

you're not under arrest, and you do not have to remain at this interview. Err, if you do remain, you
have the right to good representation. Obviously, Mr Farrington is here on your behalf, and you're
entitled to read the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 Codes of Practice.

(TC: 00:01:10)
Carl: Okay

(TC: 00:01:12)

Moderator: Um, obviously, at the back you've signed there saying that I've reminded you of the
caution, err, you remain under caution, and I've, I've reminded you of your legal rights and that
you do wish Mr Farrington to remain at the interview.

(TC: 00:01:23)
Carl: Okay, yeah, no problem. Um, I do not want a friend from the Post Office. If I do, I can-, I can tell
you

(TC: 00:01:28)

Moderator: Okay, alright, thank you. Um, right, before we were cut short there, um, we were
talking about 14th March 2002. Okay, um, we just talked about those cheques. The thing that, um,
has thrown me a little bit now, and maybe you can offer an explanation as to this, um, is that on the
14th March, he buys, in total over the three, um, over the three transactions, right, he buys, um,
€64,900.

(TC: 00:01:59)
Carl: Yeah.

(TC: 00:01:59)
Moderator: Yeah, okay. He goes off to, um, where we refer to MP4, um, he goes off to Thomas
Cook down the road, and he deposits €60,000 on the same day.

(TC: 00:02:13)
Carl: Yeah.

(TC: 00:02:16)

Moderator: Yeah, and we talked about that before. It was less than £4,900, okay. Now, what
concerns me a little bit, and maybe, you know, as I said, you might be able to explain. This is the
actual transaction from Thomas Cook, um, alright. This is the records that they keep, transcript,
yes, a bit like ourselves and the post office, and this is their till receipt, okay.

(TC: 00:02:38)
Carl: Yes.

(TC: 00:02:40)
Moderator: There's their till receipt. Um, it's 14th March 2002, €60,000 bought from the customer,
yes?

(TC: 00:02:47)
Carl: Yes.

(TC: 00:02:47)
Moderator: Then they give the Sterling value. If you have a close look at that, you'll probably be
able to work out how much you made from it, but it gives a Sterling amount.

(TC: 00:02:53)
Carl: Yes.

(TC: 00:02:54)
Moderator: What concerns me is the time, Carl, because the time that they bought the Euros back
from him was at 11:57 hours.

(TC: 00:03:02)
Carl: Mmhmm, yes.

(TC: 00:03:06)
Moderator: Well, how did he have €60,000 to sell to Thomas Cook at 11:57 hours if he hadn't
bought them from you yet?

(TC: 00:03:14)
Carl: Well, he must have had some himself.

(TC: 00:03:16)

Moderator: No, you see, he doesn't, because the previous day, or the previous amount, should I
say, on 12th March, right, two days before the 14th, he buys €57,000 from you and on the same day
he deposits €57,000.

(TC: 00:03:31)
Carl: Then I don't know what-,

(TC: 00:03:31)
Moderator: On the 9th March, which is a Saturday, he buys €40,000 from you and he deposits
€40,000 from you. So, err, he probably didn't have any excess amount.

(TC: 00:03:40) ;
Carl: I don't know that, do I? I'm noti

(TC: 00:03:43)
Moderator: No, indeed, you're not.

(TC: 00:03:44)

Carl: I mean, he might have turned around and said, look, he wanted to use €60,000, or whatever,
however much he wanted to use, and he made up of his own money and came back and, I don't know, he
might even of wanted use some of his own money he was going to use legitimately, as I say, for business,
and I didn't have my stuff for (ph 04.05) in the morning. He used some of his own money or legitimate
money he was going to use for his own business and come back and-,

(TC: 00:04:09)
Moderator: Well, yes, but he must have found €40,000 of his legitimate own money then.

(TC: 00:04:16)

(TC: 00:04:24) ; a”
Moderator: No you don't, no, and what I'm saying to you is that____ GRO iwhether it's
known to you or not, is carrying out this little scam of his to make money, ok: e goes in, buys
Euros from you one day, and generally, on the same day he goes off and deposits them. Sometimes
it's a day later, sometimes it's two days later and here we are, he's doing exactly that. On the 14th
he buys them from you and he sells them back to Thomas Cook on the 14th. Then on the 19th, a
few days later, he buys some more off you, €45,000 and he deposits €40,600 on the 19th. So, it
doesn't seem as though he's got any spare cash lying around, albeit he may well have, but this is
how his little seam works. He buys from you, he sells immediately afterwards to Thomas Cook.

(TC: 00:05:11)
Patrick Farrington: Mr Page has answered that question on at least two occasions on the last five
minutes.

(TC: 00:05:14)
Carl: I don't know.

(TC: 00:05:17)
Patrick Farrington: He said he doesn't know. Can we please move on.

(TC: 00:05:20)
Carl: Alright, I mean, why don't you ask me, why does he drive a BMW and not a Ford Focus. How the
hell would I know? Can he afford it, yes or no?

(TC: 00:05:27)
Moderator: Did you give him all of the Euros, €64,900, at 7:20 hours?

(TC: 00:05:36)
Carl: I would have only given him what's on there, €44,900. That's all I would have had in stock.

(TC: 00:05:43)

(TC: 00:05:48)
Moderator: Right. So, you didn't give him all of the €64,000 at 7:20.

(TC: 00:05:56)
Carl: I'm 99.99% sure, I mean, it was half a year ago, no, I didn't.

(TC: 00:06:00)
Moderator: Right, okay.

(TC: 00:06:06)
Carl: I mean, are there any more incidents like that?

(TC: 00:06:10)
Moderator: Do you know of any?

(TC: 00:06:10)
Carl: No, I'm asking you a question. You' re the one with the figures in front of you.

(TC: 00:06:13)
Moderator: Okay. It seems odd though, doesn't it?

(TC: 00:06:18)
Patrick Farrington: Well, again, he's answered the question and can we move on, please?

(TC: 00:06:25)

Moderator: Right, let's, um, let's go to, um, one or two of the cheques, then, and, err, let's have a
look at Friday 22nd March. Right, um, schedule back, Friday 22nd March, right, a number of

(TC: 00:07:13)

(TC: 00:07:20)
Carl: Yes, and one for €5,000

(TC: 00:07:21)
Moderator: At 07:23. Yes? Okay. Now, the 07:21, let's concentrate on that, right. €43,200 he buys,
and the value should be £25,411.76.

(TC: 00:07:39)
Carl: Yes.

(TC: 00:07:39)
Moderator: Yes, okay. These are some of the cheques, right. Well, let's, 07:18, right, the 07:18

(TC: 00:08:30)
Carl: £2,941.18.

(TC: 00:08:32)
Moderator: Indeed, right. Now, that cheque, where are the ones we just talked about? Sorry, there
is it. Um, that's the cheque there, yes?

(TC: 00:08:58)
Carl: Okay.

(TC: 00:08:58)

Moderator: We have a cheque, cheque number 100264, 22nd March 2002, for £15,411.76. Why is it
£10,000 short?

(TC: 00:09:40)
Moderator: He might have given you £10,000 in cash. Has he ever bought from you in case
before?

(TC: 00:09:44)
Carl: Mmm, he used to. He did for a little while. Not very often, though, but I did point that out to the
police when I got interviews. He did bring cash a couple of times, plus a cheque.

(TC: 00:09:59)
Moderator: He's given you cash sometimes, and a cheque?

(TC: 00:10:00)
Carl: (TC 00:10:00) Mmhmm,, it's taken about three or four times, and that was it.

(TC: 00:10:03)
Moderator: Three or four times, right. It's news to me. I haven't heard that before, and I've read
the transcripts that the police had with you.

(TC: 00:10:09)
Carl: Right.

(TC: 00:10:11)
Moderator: That's never mentioned before. It seems to be that the suggestion was he always paid
by cheque.

(TC: 00:10:15)
Carl: Well, 99% of the time he did pay by cheque.

(TC: 00:10:18)
Moderator: But, for that occasion then he must have given you cash.

(TC: 00:10:20)
Carl: He must have given me cash, or he might have given another cheque later on. If there's no cheque
there he must have given me the cash.

(TC: 00:10:30)
Moderator: You don't know why, you think it might have been cash he gave you.

(TC: 00:10:33)
Carl: Yes.

(TC: 00:10:34)

Moderator: Okay. Um, now, again, these cheques and, you know, I think you've answered it
already but I'll make the point on tape, these cheques which were taken in on the 22nd March, err,
didn't get dispatched until 27th, on the BCV and again it's a delay of six days.

heques I'm holding back, or is it just the

(TC: 00:11:16)
Moderator: Well, you tell me, which ones are you holding back?

(TC: 00:11:20)
Carl: I'm holding the bureau cheques back, because I told you I'm holding them back.

(TC: 00:11:23)
Moderator: So, it's all cheques taken from bureau, are held back.

(TC: 00:11:24)
Carl: That's correct.

(TC: 00:11:25)
Moderator: Okay. Let's look at 28th March 2002. 28th March, only one transaction, happens at
08:45.

(TC: 00:11:39)
Carl: Mmhmm.

(TC: 00:11:39)
Moderator: €45,000 bought, and that's the value, £26k odd.

(TC: 00:11:44)
Carl: Yes.

(TC: 00:11:44)
Moderator: Yes, and if we look at the cheques in relation to that amount we come across this
cheque here which is cheque number, I think it's 100271, but it's a little bit blurred.

(TC: 00:12:08)

(TC: 00:12:12)
Carl: Yes.

(TC: 00:12:13)
Moderator: It's ten grand light again, Carl.

(TC: 00:12:15)
Carl: As I said to you, a couple of times he's maybe done that. I know he has done that.

(TC: 00:12:20)
Moderator: So, he probably gave you cash on that occasion, as well, to make up the difference.

(TC: 00:12:21)
Carl: Maybe, yes.

(TC: 00:12:23)

Moderator: See, that doesn't work with his scam. He can't make a profit, giving you cash, Carl, not
that you would be aware of that, but if he gives you cash, and that's the whole reason why he gives
you cheques, if he gives you, err, cash, he's not, you know, one, the money is coming straight out of
his account, and secondly, you know, it's not making him any profit.

(TC: 00:12:45)
Carl: Well, that's not down to me. So, it doesn't concern me at all, does it?

(TC: 00:12:47)

Moderator: No, but, see, that doesn't follow his modus operandi, because every other occasion he
seems to have paid by cheque. For the 110 transactions we've got, err, we've got the vast majority
of those cheques back, but yet, these two are ten grand light, and you now offer the explanation
(talking over each other 13.03) ten grand in cash.

(TC: 00:13:10)
Moderator: Mmm, but, err, I think you have mentioned previously in interviews that he always
pays by cheque.

(TC: 00:13:15)
Carl: The majority of times, as far as I can remember, he always paid by cheque.

(TC: 00:13:18)
Moderator: But it seems to have now changed slightly-,

(TC: 00:13:20)
Carl: What, two transactions over, what, how many transactions he's done.

(TC: 00:13:24)

(TC: 00:13:27)

Carl: Is it 0.1% of all the transactions he does, is it?

(TC: 00:13:30)

Moderator: I don't know, I haven't worked that out, Carl. Okay, now, there are some other, err,
anomalies, as well. Um, let's have a look at Wednesday 29th May. Okay, Wednesday 29th May,

(TC: 00:14:46)
Carl: Why did I accept a cheque without a year on?

Moderator: Well, that was my second question.

(TC: 00:14:49)
Carl: Yes.

(TC: 00:14:50)
Moderator: The first question which sprung to mind was that if you conducted a transaction on
18th May, where are we? 28th May, okay, why you took a cheque which was dated 31st May.

(TC: 00:15:03)
Carl: No, you said 28th May. No, you' ve got 31st May

(TC: 00:15:09)
Moderator: No, that's not the same value. This is a cheque in relation to the transaction which
happened on 28th.

(TC: 00:15:15)
Carl: No, 29th May, £37,575, which is 29th May.

(TC: 00:15:21)

(TC: 00:15:24)
Carl: Okay.

(TC: 00:15:25)
Moderator: On 29th May, you do that transaction for that same value, £37,000, whatever.

(TC: 00:15:32)
Colin Price: Friday.

(TC: 00:15:34)
Moderator: Yes, 29th was a Wednesday, the 31st was a Friday. So, the first question that springs to
mind is why you took that cheque for a transaction which occurred on Wednesday 29th.

(TC: 00:15:46)
Carl: Before you go any further, I think I was at Euro Disney. When did I get audited, last?

(TC: 00:15:52)
Moderator: You were in Euro Disney at the latter part of, um, June.

(TC: 00:15:55)
Carl: July. June, okay. That's right. I knew it was the end of the month some time. Okay, fair enough.
That's fair enough. So, it's £37,575.76, and down for that is what, 29th?

(TC: 00:16:08)
Moderator: Yes.

(TC: 00:16:09)
Carl: I mean, before you' ve shown me the cheques, he's put the wrong date on. Do I accept post-dated
cheques? No, I don't.

(TC: 00:16:15)

Moderator: Well, clearly you do. This is at least the second example I've shown you of a post-dated
cheque and I'm not going through all of them. There's many post-dated cheques. Why do you do
that?

(TC: 00:16:26)
Carl: I don't check the date, to be fair, if I'm honest, on most of the cheques.

(TC: 00:16:29)
Moderator: Right, so, would that be why you also missed off the year?

(TC: 00:16:32)
Carl: Yes, I would say so, yes.

(TC: 00:16:34)
Moderator: Because you don't check the date.

(TC: 00:16:37)
Carl: I check the date, when you' re doing the transactions and you're going through, you check the
amount that figures up. You don't expect to check the dates, as well.

(TC: 00:16:43)
Moderator: Would it be because the transaction happened on a Wednesday.

(TC: 00:16:47)
Carl: Yes.

(TC: 00:16:48)
Moderator: Cash account end week. If he dates it after the Wednesday, you don't have to submit it
until the next Wednesday, do you?

(TC: 00:16:54)
Carl: Yes, but if the auditors come in, I'm going to show a shortage, aren't I?

(TC: 00:17:18)

(TC: 00:17:26)
Carl: Mmhmm

(TC: 00:17:27)
Moderator: 5th June, with it you sent away another 99 cheques, right. So, you see, you did that
transaction on week nine, on Wednesday 29th May.

(TC: 00:17:35)
Carl: Yes.

(TC: 00:17:39)

Moderator: The cheque is dated for week 10, right, and you don't send it away until you have to on
Wednesday 5th June, which is week 10. So, how did you account for this transaction of 29th in your
finances, in your accounts, in your cash account? Because clearly you didn't bring this cheque to
account until the following week.

one, and here are the actual printouts from the bottom copy, and you can see there's one after each
one. Why did you put them in as five different transactions?

(TC: 00:19:23)
Carl: I don't know, it might not have been me doing it. It might have been one of the girls that have done
it, and just checking that the man had £20,000 bundles, and sell £20,000 at a time.

(TC: 00:19:32)
Moderator: Right, but it ups your remuneration, doesn't it?

(TC: 00:19:38)

(TC: 00:19:59)

(TC: 00:21:10)

what they all equate to.

Carl: Well, yes, but in the same we also have foreign currency, as well.

(TC: 00:31:28)
Moderator: You have foreign currency in the safe.

(TC: 00:31:29)
Carl: Yes

(TC: 00:31:30)
Moderator: Okay, that's the AM stock, is it?

(TC: 00:31:31)
Carl: AM stock and put two in the side there with (mw 31.33) stuff.

(TC: 00:31:33)
Moderator: Okay, right. So, that's the value, cash held, £107,005.30, and then below that you see
the revaluation, £73,779, which is what you reported to Chesterfield, yes.

(TC: 00:31:46)
Carl: Yes.

(TC: 00:31:48)
Moderator: That's the figure that you put onto your cash account, isn't it? This, £107,005.30, yes?

(TC: 00:31:54)
Carl: That goes in the bureau and there's also one in the foreign currency, as well. That's the figure in
Horizon on the bureau till, and there's one on the AM till, as well.

(TC: 00:32:03)
Moderator: Right, this £107,000, is that the figure you feed into Horizon so that it appears on the
cash account?

(TC: 00:32:10)
Carl: Yes, but you' ve got that one on Horizon on the bureau and I' ve had some foreign currency on the
AM stock, as well. So, cash held would be that plus that.

hold in the office, whether it's in the bureau till-,

Carl: No, just the bureau till.

(TC: 00:32:36)

(TC: 00:32:38)

(TC: 00:32:58)
Carl: No, it should be in this foreign currency.

(TC: 00:33:00)
Moderator: But that's what I'm saying, if it's in foreign currency, on the cash account, that's the
figures you have to declare, isn't it?

(TC: 00:33:06)
Carl: No, that weekly summary sheet there is for the bureau till.

(TC: 00:33:12)

Moderator: Yes, I understand that, but that's also the figure-, if I show you a cash account, right,
and I show you the cash account relating to that week, week 41, this is it, right. This is exhibit,
sorry, AP19. Yes, okay, there we are. Cash account week 41, yes.

(TC: 00:33:34)
Carl: Okay

(TC: 00:33:35)
Moderator: Week ending 08/01/2003. Right, if we have a look at table number five, which is the
cash stock, etc. in hand, at line 50 it shows £106,321.42 as cash.

(TC: 00:33:55)

they started their audit, didn't they?

balancing AM stock, he pulls out a print out, right, he pulls out this printout here, which is his

(TC: 00:35:27)

(TC: 00:35:29)
Carl: Well, whenever he had the cheque, because I had the cheque for £278,000.

(TC: 00:35:33)
Moderator: No, when did he have that, because on the 13th, the day before, he presented four
cheques and had £360,000.

(TC: 00:35:39)
Carl: He might have had the week before, like I told you.

(TC: 00:35:41)
Moderator: On the week before is the 7th, and we've got those two cheques because they've been
stopped, as well.

(TC: 00:35:46)
Carl: Yes, and what are you trying to say?

(TC: 00:35:48)
Moderator: Well, where was that money?

Carl: Well, GRO has had it, because he gave me the cheque, and I put that cheque in for the
money he took out.

(TC: 00:35:57)

Carl: Well, I' ve got a cheque there for £278,000 to cover that.

(TC: 00:36:24)
Moderator: But you sold him more Euros on that back of that, so you can't cover it on that, as
well, can you? You can't have it both ways, Carl.

(TC: 00:36:29)
Carl: No, but I' ve got a cheque there for £278,000 which he gave me for the Euros which came out of
that till.

(TC: 00:36:34)
Moderator: Right, have you been inflating your, err, um, cash accounts, Mr Page?

(TC: 00:36:39)
Carl: No.

(TC: 00:36:40)
Moderator: Are you sure?

(TC: 00:36:40)
Carl: Yes.

Moderator: Alright. Let's, err, move on then, Carl, because what I want to show you now is
schedule MP6. Um, what I've done, err, I've gone through, um, all of the till receipts, okay, and I've
gone through them and I've found, err, all of the declared, um, values for the F10 commands, there,
which is the figure that should reported on to the, um, cash account.

(TC: 00:37:09)
Carl: Yes.

(TC: 00:37:10)

Moderator: This is schedule MP6, right. Starting backwards, Carl, 08/01/03, which is week 41,
alright, the one we just talked about, there's your cash on hand figure that you declared, £106,000.
There's the figure that you declared as £389,005.30, as foreign currency on hand, right, and that's
the actual value on the command ten, which should have been-,

Moderator: The different is £282,000, right.

(TC: 00:37:50)
Carl: Yes.

(TC: 00:37:52)
Moderator: If you have a look, and I've seen you scan it already, if you have a look at every single
week previously, Carl, you were quoting two different figures, Carl.

(TC: 00:38:00)
Carl: One in the bureau, and one in the AM stock.

(TC: 00:38:04)
Moderator: Well, you can't do, can you? How can you, because it either has to be included as
foreign currency or cash?

Moderator: I haven't seen one. You couldn't tell me when it was, could you? It's not on my
schedule. I don't know whether it existed or not, Carl.

(TC: 00:38:24)
Carl: Well, what do you mean by that?

(TC: 00:38:25)
Moderator: Well, I don't know whether you did give him Euros on that cheque or not. It's only
what you're saying. I haven't found any evidence of it. Is that what you're saying?

(TC: 00:38:34)
Carl: Yes.

Moderator: He seems to suggest that he only gave you those cheques for the bounce cheques, he
didn't tell me about any Euros he's had, but that's a different point, Carl. Can you explain why
you're declaring different figures every week? If you go back.

(TC: 00:38:49)
Carl: Yes.

(TC: 00:38:50)

Moderator: Alright, week 40. So, you're saying, I'm going to declare £299,157.71 as your foreign
currency on hand, and in face the forward money changer (ph 39.00), the command ten actually
shows £19,157.71 and that's, err, an inflation of £280,000.

(TC: 00:39:08)
Carl: Yes, because I'm using the AM stock. Hold on a minute, you're telling me that I' ve got £280,000
odd.

(TC: 00:39:16)

Moderator: I don't know what you've done with £280,000 odd, Carl. It can't clearly be in the AM
stock, Carl, because if it's in the AM stock you're either going to declare it as cash, or you're going
to declare it as foreign currency.

Carl: Yes.

(TC: 00:40:27)

Moderator: Right, which is this week, there, 26th June 2002, okay, your cash figure that you were
declaring on hand showed a figure of £211,286.54 and you were showing a foreign currency on
hand figure of £85,179, okay. Now, if you look prior to that, you know, going backwards, you can
see that the currency on hand figures are quite low, aren't they, which equate to command ten
figures.

(TC: 00:40:55)
Carl: That's right, yes.

(TC: 00:40:56)
Moderator: Right, but if you look at your cash on hand declared, they're very high figures. I mean,
here we are, look, week six, £365,000.

(TC: 00:41:03)
Carl: As you can,;
that much in stock.

: the amount of Euros he's having off me per week, I’ve needed to keep

(TC: 00:41:11)

Moderator: Why do you need to keep cash in hand for him when he pays you by cheque and you're
ordering Euros and giving him Euros. Why would you have Sterling cash? That cash on hand
figure is not anything to do with foreign currency.

(TC: 00:41:22)
Carl: No, that there, I mean, I had that in stock and I was told to reduce it dramatically and I did do.

(TC: 00:41:27)

Moderator: Right, well, you didn't, actually, because this little highlighted figure here, you were
contacted by the (mw 41.33) people, weren't you? Matrix team, many times saying, "Carl, you're
holding too much cash. Please return it," and they even rang you up, didn't they, and they said,
"Carl, please return it. We're making provisions for a vehicle to come and collect it on the
Thursday."

(TC: 00:41:47)
Carl: No, they came on the Friday, and they came to pick it up on the Friday and I wasn't there. The
reason why I wasn't there, because my dad had a heart attack, and the area manager was informed.

(TC: 00:42:04)

Moderator: Claimed out £160k. He did, didn't he? However, if you have a look, Carl, shortly after
that, these inflations start on the ford money changer and the foreign currency and the cash values
that you hold go down.

(TC: 00:42:22)
Carl: Yes.

(TC: 00:42:23)

Moderator: You see, what I think you've been doing, Carl, and those figures demonstrate it, is that
you've been inflating your cash for quite some time. I'd say more than a year, probably two years
GRO but because you were hassled, err, by the (mw 42.41) people about the high value of,

‘GT, Cas 1 had on hand, and because they came and physically removed £160k from your safe,

right, you had to find another way of hiding the shortage.

looked at the difference in what you've been declaring on the ford money changer, and what's
actually on the bottom copy receipt. For them to do that, they would have had to take the till rolls
away, Carl. They clearly didn't because I've got them, and I got them on 13th, so they wouldn't
know, would they? How would they know?
