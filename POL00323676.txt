Subject: RE: Fujitsu Lawyers and the Friday Conference Call.
Susan,

Many thanks for your e-mail. I have been considering the position today and I remain extremely
nervous about having Fujitsu’s lawyers on the Friday conference call. At the present time only
POL lawyers and lawyers instructed by POL are on the call. If Fujitsu’s lawyers are on the call they
will have a duty to report the entire contents of the call back to their client.

Whilst there may be merit in us meeting with the Fujitsu lawyers if, for example, they are able to
assist with disclosure etc, I think that such meetings should be on an ad hoc basis and with very
clear and limited agendas. With a conference call there is in my opinion a greater risk that the
Fujitsu lawyers may try to raise issues which we/you would prefer not to be discussed in front of
them.

I will be out of the office tomorrow and so my colleague Andrew Bolc will be dialling in to
provide the weekly update. If we are to meet with the Fujitsu lawyers in due course, I think that it
would first be appropriate for us to have a chat about the agenda and the issues which may well
arise.

So far as Simon’s Advice in relation to GJ is concerned, I understand that it was drafted with the
knowledge that it may well be disclosed and so I would have no objection to that. The Scope

document is work in progress and will most probably be perfected in the near future.

Kind regards

Martin.

I met with our relationship manager and one of the lawyers from Fujitsu today, Michael Harvey, a couple of issues
have come out from our conversation which I think that we should discuss and wonder if you would be happy for him
to join our call at 4 on Friday afternoon. If that works for you I think that he should see the advice re Gareth Jenkins
and the proposed scope for the expert before our call — are you happy me to send these documents through to him.
Thanks

Susan
