Hi Helen,

This attached report, as well as a couple of other SSK Crown branch incidents, has caused a few
concerns on the Wednesday morning call.

I noted the attached report stated that “At this time no allegations have been substantiated or
evidence gained worthy of further investigation”.

Would this mean that the alleged replacement of the SSK at Yeovil wasn’t substantiated either?
Do you know how this was left with the Crown Team would Mark have provided his report to
someone in Crown too for any further action they deemed necessary? Do you know whether or
not anyone requested or received a report from NCR regarding the specific issues relating to the
SSK in question at Yeovil?

Also I understand that conference calls were taking place between Crown, Atos, FSC regarding
SSK machines, do you know whether anyone from Security was engaged in any of these calls?
For info I asked Sharon Brearley (Service Manger Atos) for a report on Yeovil and this is the
response I received:-

“At my meeting with NCR this month, I asked them to provide details of the fault history from
the time the kiosks were installed at Yeovil, below is the information provided.

NCR Overview

History at Yeovil from when it was installed (14/08/14) is below up to and including April a total
of 25 calls , below that are the 9 calls since 1** May of which 3 were chargeable. April rather
than March was the problem month and could be put down to bad practice in the engineers
attending and clearing the jam on the printers but not actually diagnosing the root cause. Only
one call logged for touchscreen which was in April not August to December as suggested.

e 8 Network calls either damaged cable or being pulled out the wall

e 11 Printer calls which tended to be cleared and then repeat calls as all happened within 6
weeks before eventually replaced

2 rebuilds of software

2 No fault founds

1 Cabinet door loose

1 Touchscreen issue

This report from NCR does not actually mention a replaced SSK machine. Looking at the list of
replaced parts and rebuilds this may amount to a new SSK?

Hi Andy,

POL00043619

I'd like to get this one bottomed out rather than leave it rumbling along so can you let me
know:-

e Are conference calls still ongoing regarding incidents for SSKs please?

e If Yes Who attends the calls (names if you have them please)?

e Are FSC still receiving reported losses or enquiries from Crown Network related to SSKs?

e To date and as a result of the conf calls, has anyone provided any reports on the
incidents raised at Crowns that you're aware of?

e Is there any report that you know of that would provide MI on Crown Network losses
relating to SSK terminals? (Not suggesting you would have that in FSC but it may have
been discussed?)

Thanks
Anne

Nick/Andy,

I note you are dealing with SSKs re the Horizon bi-weekly call notes.
For info, associated is the case closure for Yeovil ... appears one SSK was faulty rather than Horizon
affected.
