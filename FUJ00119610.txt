1 Purpose

This document contains ICL Pathway’s Resolution Plan in respect of Acceptance
Incident 378.

2 Summary

ICL Pathway distributed the fix to the original incident, of which there were five
occurrences, on 9-10 August. ICL Pathway is preparing an extension to this fix to
cover a similar incident.

3 Criteria

The Criterion under test is 831/1.

“The Contractor shall support interfaces from TMS and Outlets to Transaction
Information Processing TIP”

4  POCL position
Based upon the minutes of the Acceptance Board Meeting of 18 August 1999, POCL
contended that:

“rectification activity had not been successful and further analysis was awaited from
Pathway”.

5 Pathway position

5.1 Further analysis from Pathway
The original incident that gave rise to AI 378 was diagnosed and a fix was distributed
to the counters on 9-10 August. There had been two occurrences.
A further three incidents were reported all relating to the period before 10 August.

A further incident with similar symptoms, but a different root cause (TIP 916) has
been reported and is being diagnosed and the system made robust against such
occurrences.

5.2 Resolution

ICL Pathway will continue to monitor for such incidents and fix them. The incidents
are tracked at the detailed level in 4/378 TIP Incident Status Report.

5.3. Clearance action

incidents. The fix implemented on 9-10 August has been in monitored as successful
for over a month.

The fix for TIP 916 is in preparation and will be monitored for a period of two weeks
after implementation.
