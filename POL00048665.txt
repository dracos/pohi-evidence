Dear Madam
re: R-y- Josephine Hamilton - Winchester Crown Court
For Trial - 10" September 2007

We thank you for your letter of 24" April 2007.

Firstly, please would you note the correct address to which correspondence
should be sent.

We have received from our client a substantial amount of financial
documentation which quite frankly should have been taken by your
employees at the time of suspending our client as the sub-Postmistress
when an audit was also carried out. The documentation contains horizon
data, trial and final balances, APS transactions, remittances in and out,
Giro deposits and withdrawals, personal banking, cash on hand, cheques,
listing, receipts, other print outs and documents. _ It has taken 180 hours
simply to sort the documentation out into its correct weeks and as we have
already stated this is clearly work that should have been done by the
prosecution and the documents should have been part of the prosecution
case.

The documents are now contained in some 14 lever arch files and run to
approximat tely 5,000 pages. Once we have reviewed this paperwork we
will be in a position to submit to you a full Defence Case Statement
together with a comprehensive request for disclosure.

Clearly this case has grown considerably in size since the last Directions hearing. We
anticipate that our time estimate could now well be completely wrong. We have
therefore requested that the matter be listed for Mention in order that the court can be
apprised of the situation.
