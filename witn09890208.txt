Notes

1. These figures are all subject to the limitations and caveats described at paragraph 71
of the witness statement and below.

2. The post-1999 figures are based on the criteria applied in the PCDE because this data
has, where possible, been verified as accurate. These figures relate to cases where it
is confirmed (or in some cases assumed where it has not been possible to verify) that:
(a) the individual was convicted of a criminal offence; (b) POL (or RMG for prosecutions

relating to POL that took place pre-separation) was the prosecutor; and (c) the
prosecution was based wholly or partly on data derived from the Horizon IT system.

The pre-2000 data (with a green shaded background) relates to all offence types where
a conviction has been confirmed or is assumed where the defendant was an SPM,
assistant or POL employee, including all case types. A figure has also been provided
in brackets for the subset of cases considered likely to involve a shortfall in the branch
accounts based on their descriptions in Casework Spreadsheets.

There is one case for the year 2000 because there was only one Horizon-related
conviction that year. The figure for non-Horizon related cases for the year 2000 is 56
so the total figure for 2000 is 57. 18 of the 56 non-Horizon related cases are considered
likely to have involved a shortfall in the branch accounts based on their descriptions in
Casework Spreadsheets.

For 2001, there were 35 Horizon-related cases, 44 non-Horizon cases, so 79
convictions in total for all offence types. 13 of the 44 non-Horizon cases are considered
likely to have involved a shortfall in the branch accounts based on their descriptions in
Casework Spreadsheets.

For 2002, there were 60 Horizon-related cases, 13 non-Horizon cases, so 73
convictions in total for all offence types. Two of the 13 non-Horizon cases are
considered likely to have involved a shortfall in the branch accounts based on their
descriptions in Casework Spreadsheets.

There is one individual who was convicted on different counts on two separate dates,
one following a guilty plea in 2009 and one following trial in 2010. To avoid the
conviction being counted twice, this case has only been counted as one conviction in
2009. The 2010 conviction is not separately included in the table.

Cases involving co-defendants have been separated. For example, a case where three
co-defendants appear to have been convicted is recorded as three convictions.

‘ Please note that there are instances where a cases involving co-defendants have been recorded on
the casework spreadsheets as one conviction, but when the underlying papers have been reviewed, it
has transpired that only one of the individuals was convicted. For the purposes of these figures for the

pre-PCDE numbers, if a conviction is recorded on the spreadsheets for a co-defendant case, it is
presumed that all individuals were convicted.
