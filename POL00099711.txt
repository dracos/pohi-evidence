Alice, these are readable on an iPad but not phone or blackberry.

Alternatively you may want to ask Jorja to print off hard copies for you. You should certainly read the first one and then
choose any selection. It will depress and distress you. Therefore, there are a no of points to bear in mind:

1) Second Sight are now fully back on board and very complimentary about how we are handling the process for such
cases. My phone call with Ron Warmington could not have been more positive. I remain wary of Ron as he can be
emotional and has been fickle with his loyalties, but I will forward you a mail trail that shows his support. Belinda has
also briefed herself on the process and was impressed with it to date.

2) 1am convinced from my meeting with Angela and her team yesterday that we need to re-establish a network of
named field support managers for branches. This is one of a number of changes they will recommend but worth flagging
as it is a theme throughout. We have some very good people who know what needs to be done and who are aware that
it has to be achieved within a reducing cost framework.

3) To remind you, Angela has already changed high profile processes to avoid any new sensitivities in this
area. (Suspension policy, introduction of suspended terminations for previously unblemished records, etc.)

4) There is more to do but Angela will have mapped out the end to end support process for Spmrs by the end of this
month and associated issues. I had an interim update yesterday in Swansea: it is challenging and wide ranging and it will

take careful integrated planning, but promises to be a catalyst for changes we would like to see.

5) This is in the spirit of no surprises. And it is not representative of the present day to day service. But it is nonetheless
disturbing.

Dear All

I would appreciate it if you would read the attached (you can ignore the spreadsheet). These are cases
which are likely to go into the mediation process as a result of the Horizon/Second Sight review now
known as Project Sparrow.

There are two reasons to ask you to do this: firstly because I think you should be aware and, secondly,
we need to think, as an ExCo, how we share this information and take the learnings from it, which
Angela van den Bogerd is currently working on through the business.

if we get time at Monday's Weekly ExCo, i would like to raise it then, otherwise we will pick up during
AOB on the 15 October.

Regards
Paula

Paula:

As promised in today's call, here are eight examples of the incoming
Applications. I've selected those that are more clearly expressed than most of
the others that we've been receiving. I'd have also sent Case M041 but it hasn't
been scanned yet.

I'm also enclosing a spreadsheet that shows which ‘Thematic Issues’ each
Applicant has reported to us. It's probably not worth you looking at that before
your meeting with Angela and her team tomorrow but, in case you do, you only need
to look at Rows 55 to 97 (those are the Mediation Applications). The rows above
that relate to the MP-sourced cases and those that came in from the JFSA. In
some cases the Mediation Applicants were already on the spreadsheet so are
cross-referenced to their earlier appearance. Where there are more ‘Thematic
Issues’ marked on an MP-sourced case than on that same case's Mediation
Application that's because we know more about the case than has as yet been
revealed in the Mediation Application.
