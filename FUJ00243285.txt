Introduction to Psychological Safety

What is psychological safety?

In a culture built on psychological safety,
there is a shared belief that the environment
is conducive to taking interpersonal risks or
engaging in acts of vulnerability such as:

{e) 2 Giving and receiving feedback

iam)

Admitting when a mistake was made

Questioning assumptions

Asking for help

/ ‘
aM 2
(2) Asking a question

A healthy culture, a psychologically safe culture,
exists where these actions of everyday
interpersonal vulnerability are rewarded as
opposed to punished. It is a culture that has a
learning mindset and embodies the reality that
things will go wrong but we will catch them and
learn from them.

The costs are real when employees hold back
their full participation. Psychologically safe
environments illicit a performance response and
encourage people to take action. Unsafe
environments that place a focus on assigning
blame, excluding those who raise concerns, and
encourage concealing failures, provoke a fear
response, creating distraction and diminishing
performance.

An environment where it is safe to speak up can
drive innovation in addition to alerting an
organisation about problems or concerns. People
who may have solutions to problems, have ideas
for product improvements, have closest contact
with clients or are otherwise in a position to
offer insights or spot hazards, may choose to
remain quiet in environments in which speaking
up is a risky or dangerous activity, or in
environments where being silent is rewarded.

Every employee, but most importantly the direct manager, has an influence on an organisation's culture.
Culture can be created by design or by default. One way that managers can transform culture, is to model
and reward acts of vulnerability, which creates an environment where people feel comfortable speaking

up.

Leadership Approachability Self-Assessment

How approachable are you and how do you model rewarded vulnerability? Assessing your approachability as a people
manager is an important step in improving your leadership skills. Take a few moments to reflect on the following:

How often do you talk about ethics and compliance related topics with your team?

Never I Once a year Ct] Once a quarter CI Once a month

How often do you hear phrases like, “I don’t know” or see people raising questions in meetings, communications, or
other interactions with your teams or colleagues?

C] Never I Rarely i Sometimes C] Often

Reflecting on a time when you witnessed the behaviour described in the prior question, what was your initial reaction?
Did you notice the reaction of others and if so, what did you see or hear?

How often have you shared stories with your team from your own experiences about making a mistake, being faced with
an ethical dilemma, or raising questions?

Never I Rarely {I Sometimes CI Often

Thinking about your team meetings, are there people who never contribute to the conversation? Are there others who
dominate the conversation? Why do you think that is?

How often do your employees or your colleagues come to you for your opinions, perspectives, and thoughts?

Never C] Rarely C] Sometimes Cl Often

How often do your employees come to you directly with concerns as opposed to you learning about concerns second-
hand? _

Strategies for Improving Your Approachability

Being an approachable manager is crucial for creating a positive work environment where employees feel comfortable
coming to you with concerns. Remember that building trust and becoming more approachable takes time and
consistency. It may not come naturally, but it is a skill that can be practised and improved. Here are some strategies to

help you become more approachable:

Active Listening:

When an employee approaches you with a concern, give
them your full attention. Show that you are listening by
maintaining eye contact, nodding, and refraining from
interrupting. Ask clarifying questions to ensure you
understand their perspective.

Open Door Policy:

Communicate that your door is always open for
employees to come and talk. Make it clear that you are
accessible and willing to listen.

Be Empathetic:

Empathy is a crucial trait for approachable managers. Try
to understand and appreciate the emotions and feelings

behind the concerns your employees bring to you. Show
that you genuinely care about their well-being.

Body Language:

Pay attention to your body language. Maintain an open
posture, and use friendly facial expressions. Avoid
appearing rushed or preoccupied when talking to
employees.

Avoid Judgement:

Create a safe space for employees to express
themselves without fear of judgement. Avoid making
hasty judgements or criticisms when they bring up
concerns.

Timely Response: Address concerns in a timely manner.
Even if you cannot provide an immediate solution,
acknowledge their concern and let them know when you
will follow up with more information, next steps, or a
resolution.

Regular Discussions: Schedule regular one-on-one
meetings with your team members to discuss their
concerns, goals, and feedback.

Transparency:

Be honest and transparent in your communications. If
you cannot share certain information due to
confidentiality, explain why you can't and reassure them
that you'll share what you can.

Encourage Feedback:

Actively seek feedback from your employees on your
own performance as a manager. This shows that you
value their opinions and are open to improvement.

Provide Resources:

Offer resources and support to help employees address
their concerns. This could involve connecting them with
the right team members or providing access to training
or tools that may help.

Conflict Resolution Skills:

Develop strong conflict resolution skills. When conflicts
arise, mediate them fairly and impartially, ensuring that
both sides feel heard and understood.

Lead by Example:

Demonstrate the behaviour you expect from your team.
If you want them to communicate openly and
professionally, model these behaviours in your
interactions with them. Ask questions. Be able to say “I
don’t know”.

Recognise and Appreciate:

Acknowledge and appreciate employees when they do
bring concerns to your attention. This positive
reinforcement can encourage more open communication
in the future.

Training and Development:

Invest in your own leadership development, including
courses or workshops on communication and
interpersonal skills.
