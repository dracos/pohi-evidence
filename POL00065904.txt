R. v. SEEMA MISRA - DISCLOSURE

1. This Note revisits the issue of disclosure in the case of R. v. Seema Misra; a topic I last

considered on the 22" January 2014.

2. I have reconsidered my advice of the 22" January 2014 and the R. v. Misra case
papers. I note that the matter is now with the Criminal Convictions Review
Commission (CCRC) by application of Mrs Misra and so have also considered the rules
of disclosure as the relate to the work of the CCRC. Finally in this respect I note that
POL is now the subject of a s.17 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1995 order in respect of

Mrs Misra’s case.

3. Given these circumstances I advise that all matters relating to issues of disclosure
now fall to be determined by the CCRC and not by POL, whether on advice or not and

POL must abide by the terms of the s.17 order.

4. Separately, POL holds material about which the CCRC do not have notice of, such as
non case-specific Advice documents etc. To the extent that any such documents may
fall to be disclosed to the CCRC or any other party, reference should be had to my

separate advice on the topic.
