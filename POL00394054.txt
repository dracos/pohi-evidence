7. Normal Data Processing Arrangements
7.1. Interface Outline
The POL RDS stores business reference data concerning
POL’s organisational units and structure, its products, PoCL
automated payment tokens and accounting structures. —
This data is primarily used to support the Horizon System
service - both ICL Pathway’s systems and the POL
OPTIP system.
All data in the RDS is driven by effective dates, hence POCL
the RDS acts as the mechanism used to manage the Pettway Transaction
implementation of operational business changes (OBC) ROM Peceeey
within the Horizon systems.
POL have undertaken to supply reference data in
accordance with agreed OBC lead times® 789 10,11,
PON POL supplies ICL Pathway with distinct reference data - type A (see
RDS section [ REF _Ref445008495 \n ]).
= x The transfer of this data is achieved by POL placing reference data files
Interface ona gateway PC owned and maintained by ICL Pathway (see section [
I REF _Ref445008405 \n J).
ICL Pathway i initi idati
RDMC. ICL Pathway will perform an initial validation of the reference data

placed on the gateway and either accept or reject it. The POL RDS team
shall be responsible for analysing and resolving any errors arising from this validation process
(see section [ REF _Ref446227920 \n ]).

Once accepted, the data will either be:
(a) Processed and released to Post Office outlets, e.g. minor changes to outlet details; or

(b) Processed and offered for further verification/authorisation by POL, prior to being released
- e.g. new products being introduced.

7.11. Type A Data Files

Type A data files consist of wholly automated extraction’s from the POL RDS. The precise
content and structure of these files in defined in the relevant AIS?

Multiple files may be created each day, up to a maximum of 999.

Supply of type A data to ICL Pathway will be in accordance with agreed Operational Business
Change procedures and timescales® 79 10,11,

Type A data files may consist of either:
> Data content records generated in support of one or a number of Help Desk changes.
>» Data content records generated in support of one or a number of Advanced changes.

> Data content records generated in order to correct a single / multiple error.

[ REF Status \* MERGEFORMAT ] [SUBJECT \*

In any case, every type A file is allocated a unique Change Control Number (CCN), which
identifies the specific change supported by the data content of the file. These CCN’s are
supplied to ICL Pathway within the data files themselves.

7.1.2. Type B Data Files

Type B (Scales) data files, the precise data content of these files is defined in a separate AIS°.
All type B data files will be accompanied by a delivery note detailing any associated CCN’s.
Type B files are created whenever changes to the relevant reference data are received.

Supply of type B data to ICL Pathway will be in accordance with agreed Operational Business
Change procedures and timescales® 79 10,11,

Multiple type B files may be created on any day, up to a maximum of 36 of each type.

On days where there are no changes to type B data, there will be no type B files sent to ICL
Pathway.

Type B data files are currently supplied by Business Service Management Development, EPOSS
Service Provision Team (Formerly Outlet Systems Group) .

Whilst the gateway PC is situated at a POL site, ICL Pathway is responsible for its maintenance
(see section [ REF _Ref444069592 \n }), and for provision of back-up facilities (see section I REF
_Ref444069596 \n ]).

7.2.1. Response Files

Response files are generated automatically by the Gateway PC to RDS and indicate success (or
failure) of the transfer of data to the Gateway PC. Response files are generated automatically
by RDMC and indicate success (or failure) to load data into RDMC.

2- POCL Reference Data Team Error File Collection

1. The POL RDS operational team shall generate and transmit reference data files to ICL
Pathway at the earliest practicable opportunity, with due regard to both agreed OBC
procedures and those times when ICL Pathway file retrieval takes place.

At 8am, and at 2 hourly intervals thereafter until 8pm, a scheduled task commences ICL
Pathway reference data file retrieval and RDMC data load.

2. The POL RDS operational team shall also collect and analyse response files generated by the
ICL Pathway RDMC (see section [ REF _Ref446227920 \n }).

3. For pre-authorised changes, the data is processed within the RDMC and TSM system and
transmitted to the Outlets overnight.

7.3.4. RDS to OPTIP Transfer problems

RDT will not release any Reference Data to the Live environment before 10 a.m. to allow the
POL Reference Data Operational Team to inform Pathway should any problem have occurred
in the transfer of data from RDS to OPTIP. This will help to reduce the risk of data being sent to
the Live counters before OPTIP has received it. Should there be any such problems, the POL

[TITLE \* MERGEFORMAT ] [ REF Status \* MERGEFORMAT ] [SUBJECT \*
MERGEFORMAT J

Reference Data operational team will advise Pathway which (if any) files will be affected by the
problem and the likely time to resolution.

7.3.5. Urgent Reference Data Changes

RDT will monitor RDMC for Reference Data changes which fall into the category of Basic
Express or Migration Special until 10am and take the appropriate action. If a Migration Special
is submitted to RDMC after 10am, and POL wish action to be taken, RDT should be contacted
by telephone and requested to progress the change (this is not an option for Basic Express
changes due to the processing times involved).

Should an incident occur which requires changes to Reference Data, the priority given to the
delivery of the Reference Data will be governed by the priority of the incident.

7.3.6. Errors and Rework

Observed errors result in the change being suspended awaiting corrective action. For example,
file(s) containing rejected records will not be processed by RDT until the rejected records have
been corrected, this will be classified as Rework.

Rework files are files which are, or appear to be, either amendment or error correction files toa
change that is currently being progressed.

Action will be taken in an attempt to establish and eliminate root causes for Rework.
74. Error Handling

For both Type A & Type B data files, ICL Pathway RDMC/RDT generates response files, the
contents of which either confirms successful loading of the data, or notifies POL of any interface
errors. In addition, file(s) acknowledging ICL Pathway’s receipt of transmitted reference data
file(s) are also generated.

POL shall expect to be in receipt of response files relating to Type A data files approximately
1% hours, but not more than two hours after transmission, during the working day.

In the case of transmissions loaded at 8pm, response files will be expected by 8am the following
day.

The following table classifies possible errors on the operational interface, and prescribes how
they should be dealt with.

7.4.1, Milestones at risk

If an error or errors might put at risk the implementation of a change within agreed OBC lead
times'!, an incident must be raised (see section [ REF _Ref446816046 \n ]), as soon as the error is
identified.

In all other cases, the party identifying the error must report it to the other party, detailing the
nature of the error, at the earliest possible opportunity.

The best course of action to manage the error through to resolution shall then be identified and
agreed. Again, if it is identified that the error may cause a change to fail to be implemented
within agreed OBC lead times", an incident must be raised (see section [ REF _Ref446816046 \n
).

74.2. Exceptional Circumstances

In exceptional circumstances, POL and ICL Pathway may agree to exchange files in other ways;
and/or apply error correction data in other ways.

The primary fallback mechanism for supply of reference data files to ICL Pathway in the event
of gateway PC failure shall be the use of e-mail.

For this purpose, the POL RDS operational team shall use the following e-mail addresses,
prioritised in the order as listed:

OBC Product¢
OBCRefData@
OBC Network

listed in section [ REF _Ref447085468 \n J.

The secondary fallback mechanism for supply of reference data files to ICL Pathway in the
event of gateway PC failure shall be the use of CD ROM, sent via courier.

CD’s shall be sent via courier to ICL Pathway’s site at Bracknell (see section [ REF
_Ref447085389 \n ]).

Response files should be sent back to the RDS operational team utilising the same ways and
means.

7.5. Engineer Visits

If, as a result of a help desk call being raised, an ICL Pathway engineer is required to visit the
POL Huthwaite site, ICL Pathway will inform POL BS National Helpdesk of the engineer's
name at least half an hour before the engineer is due to arrive.

POL will ensure that the Reception Security at Huthwaite will have a pass organised to allow
the engineer access to the site.

The engineer will carry an identity badge at all times whilst he is on site, and present it for
inspection at the Huthwaite Reception desk.

This procedure will be the same for out of hours emergency access.

7.6. File Back-up and Retention

[TITLE \* MERGEFORMAT ] [ REF Status \* MERGEFORMAT ] [SUBJECT \*
MERGEFORMAT J

7.6.1. Back-ups

The POL RDS is backed up 2 hourly (transaction logs only) with a complete back up to tape at
the end of each normal operational processing day.

The ICL Pathway RDMC and RDDS databases are backed up after agent processing.

This ensures that in the event of a system failure (whether it be either the Reference Data, ICL
Pathway or OPTIP systems failing) points of consistency exist between the systems that
minimise the potential impact of a failure.

7.6.2. Archiving

All reference data files are archived by the Reference Data operational team, prior to
transmission. In exceptional circumstances, ICL Pathway may request for a specific file or files
to be resent.

In such circumstances POL will make its best endeavours to deliver the requested file(s) within
a period of 72 hours.

In any case, POL shall leave files on the gateway for at least 7 days before deletion.

All files sent by the Reference Data operational team (reference data files, error correction files)
shall be retained for a period of 18 months, this being determined by POL internal auditing
requirements.

8. Disaster Recovery

In the event of a Major Business Continuity Incident (MBCI) the POL Central RDS team will
invoke the Reference Data Operations Team Business Continuity Plan (Ref. CON/PLN/003)
which covers :

> The relocation of the POL Central RDS and the Reference Data Operations Team within
Transaction Processing to the Colvin Assured fixed Office Recovery site in Bradford.

> The restoration of service provided by the Reference Data Operations Team.

In addition to this, the completed daily back ups of the POL Central RDS are stored off site each
night.

10. Service Management

POL and ICL Pathway have jointly developed a Service Management Framework to support
the end to end Horizon service. The framework defines a variety of discrete but inter-
dependant Service Management disciplines that both POL and ICL Pathway have agreed to
deploy consistently across their respective organisations. These are all described in the Service
Management Framework document set.

The following paragraphs describe how the disciplines of Incident Management, Business
Continuity Management, Problem Management and Change Management are deployed to
support the processing of Reference Data.

10.1. Incident Management

Incidents are day to day faults and failures in computer systems or related processes and
procedures. For example, in the reference data environment these will include all of the
following:

> Hardware, software, networking faults

> Interruptions to data processing
>» Delayed or incorrect data
>» Accounting and reconciliation errors

Fundamentally, the incident management discipline is aimed at ensuring all incidents are
reported to an appropriate Help Desk service. Amongst other things, the Help Desk will record,
allocate a unique identifier, prioritise and manage every incident through to a satisfactory
resolution. There are three significant Help Desk services supporting the reference data
environment, i.e. Horizon Systems Help Desk (ICL Pathway), National Helpdesk (BS) and the
Network Business Support Centre (POL).

10.1.1. Incident Management within POL

If an incident arises within POL there will be a choice of Help Desk services to contact. National
Helpdesk will field all incidents of a technical nature, excepting those that involve the Horizon
equipment deployed in Post Office outlets. The Network Business Support Centre will field all
business incidents.

Certain incidents may have technical and business aspects. These will be reported to both
National Helpdesk and the Network Business Support Centre. The two Help Desks will co-
operate over the management and resolution process.

10.1.2. Incident Management within ICL Pathway

All technical and business incidents arising within ICL Pathway will be reported to the Horizon
Systems Help Desk. Post Office outlets will also contact the Horizon Systems Help Desk to
report any incidents involving the local computer systems installed by ICL Pathway.

10.1.3. Cross Boundary Incident Management

The nature of this interface means that certain incidents will require action and investigation
across the organisational boundaries of POL and ICL Pathway. The raising of incidents across
boundaries can only be done by the respective Help Desks. Both National Helpdesk or the

MERGEFORMAT J

Network Business Support Centre are empowered to raise incidents with the Horizon Systems
Help Desk (and vice versa). When an incident is passed between Help Desk services each will
make a note of the unique identifier allocated by the other (for tracking and audit purposes).

10.1.4, Help Desk Call Matrices

The Horizon Systems Help Desk, BS National Helpdesk and the Network Business Support
Centre will co-operate to develop a Help Desk Call Matrix for each service. These will
categorise the likely incident scenarios, clarify the proper reporting routes, highlight the
potential technical or business impacts of each incident and specify the anticipated call to fix
times.

10.1.5. Prioritisation

The SLA with the RDS supplier, in conjunction with BS National Helpdesk, will allocate a status
of High, Medium or Low for each incident.

10.1.6. Expert Domains

It may be necessary for various experts in ICL Pathway, ITS and POL to co-operate over the
resolution of certain incidents. It is therefore important that the respective roles and
responsibilities of the relevant expert domains are clearly defined and agreed. Sections [ REF
_Ref446229979 \n ] and [ REF _Ref446229984 \n ] provide further information and contact
details.

10.2. Business Continuity Management

Certain incidents may arise at the RDS/ICL Pathway interface which have the potential could
cause major operational disruption and/or have serious impacts on customers and clients.
These will be regarded as Major Business Continuity Incidents and identified as such within the
Help Desk Call Matrices (see section [ REF _Ref446230033 \n })

Major Business Continuity Incidents will be subject to the Cross Domain Business Continuity
Management process. This supports immediate escalation of a Major Business Continuity
Incident to senior managers in both organisations who will form a joint Business Continuity
Management Team. The escalation route is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a
year.

The joint Business Continuity Management Team will co-ordinate the invocation of Recovery
Plans and Contingency Procedures where necessary.

10.3. Problem Management

POL has established a Problem Management function within its Business Service Management
organisation.

ICL Pathway has established a Problem Management function within their Customer Services
organisation.

These functions exist to facilitate the escalation, management and resolution of problems that
impact across the boundaries.

Consequently, all problems that arise across the RDS/ICL Pathway interface must be reported
to and progressed via these routes.

11. Documentation & Reporting

Should all necessary data required for the implementation of a change not be received by the
necessary OBC milestone, an incident will be raised detailing what data was not received, and
to what change the missing data relates.

The RDS operational team shall expect to receive a summary of all incidents logged with ITS
from the POL Support Services team, on a monthly basis.

12. OLA Reviews
12.1. Ownership

This OLA shall be owned and maintained by the RDS operational team, who shall utilise
suitable procedures to manage any changes to this document that may arise (see section [ REF
_Ref447094352 \n }).

12.2. Operational Review Forum
POL and ICL Pathway will review this OLA through operational review meetings.

These meetings shall be held at regular intervals, Reference Data Operational Review Forum
held monthly, and the OLA will be addressed within these operational review meetings
whenever it is considered necessary, during the period the OLA remains relevant.

In any case, this OLA should be reviewed within 12 months of sign off.

Any amendments to the OLA will remain non-contractual but will be agreed between POL and
ICL Pathway through the Operational Review Meetings, and agreed representatives from POL
and ICL Pathway shall formally sign off an updated hardcopy version.
