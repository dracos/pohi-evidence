 Hi Jon

 I hope you had a good break.

 I've decided to take Monday off. I'm pretty sure you II need to catch up on everything that's been going on in your
 absence so I assume you wouldn't be able to make Monday. If you can make Tuesday, that's great. Either email or
 ring; if there's no answer just let me know what time you can be with us.

 Failing that, we can talk on Tuesday and arrange some time.

.,?<ind regards
  fenny

 telephone call, as below.

 Jon

 We need some help with analysis and witness statement generation for Gareth, would you be available Monday or

Charles,

I've added my comments to your 5th Report (attached — comments are as Word revisions — mainly                               the far right hand




                                                                                                                       in

 0303.5th interim
  technical exp...
As discussed briefly I've also now got hold of the transaction logs for December 2006 to December 2007. These
amount to a total of nearly half a million transactions (431,490 to be precise).

What I have done is searched through them looking for all examples of Debit Card transactions which have not been
successful, since this seems to be one of the defence's main attacks on the system.

There are 92 such failed transactions for a total value of £117,149.98.                    analysed         those with an individual value-
                                                                                    I've




                                                                                                      all




of more than £1,000 (leaving £6,113.55 worth that I've not analysed).

In all the cases I've analysed one of 3 things happened

1 The Customer session was then settled by a Cheque (and so the failure must have been noticed by the clerk)
2. The Customer session was abandoned (ie any good were.returned and the transactions cancelled and the only
   item from the session is the failed Debit Card payment).
3. The Customer session was settled to Cash (which could have been accidental). However in all such cases the
   transaction was subsequently reversed resulting in the cash also being reversed.

There are business rules that control whether transactions can be cancelled or if they have to be committed and then
reversed (which is the main difference between cases 2 and 3 above). I suspect (but can't necessarily prove) that in
case 2 the sessions were for purchase of Foreign Currency. I case.3 the sessions were all for purchase of Premium
Bonds.

I think this refutes the assertion that failed Debit Card Payments are the cause of the losses.

I'm not sure what further analysis to carry out. However I've identified some possible areas to pursue:

1. I've looked at Pouch Reversals (where cash or currency is packed for despatch to POL's Cash Centre) and the
   Pouch is subsequently Cancelled. This is a method by which cash losses can be partially hidden and was
   mentioned in the defendant's interviews. For Dec 2006 there were no such examples.
2. Each night there should be a Cash Declaration made for each Stock Unit in the Branch indicating the current cash
   in the till. It is also possible to look at all the cash movements for each Stock Unit by looking at the Cash
   transactions. I've tried to compare the Cash movements in terms of the Transactions and also in terms of
   differences in Declarations and there seems to be very little correlation indicating that the cash declarations are
   probably inaccurate
3. As part of the monthly Balancing process, special transactions are recorded to reflect Stock Adjustments and
   Discrepancies detected by the system as part of this process. These all result in the system assuming that Cash it
   put into (or removed) from the Till to reflect these Adjustments I Discrepancies. It may be worth examining these.

As arranged, I'll give you a ring at 12 noon tomorrow.
