2.01.0 Introduction

2AL Purpose

This Access Control Policy (ACP) defines the policy for controlling access to resources in the
Fujitsu Services (Pathway) Ltd IT system.

Effective control depends on:
Understanding the information in the system and what access to it should be permitted,
and where it is vulnerable, and

© Having a clear definition of the roles and responsibilities of all personnel who need some
form of access to the system, and

© Setting access policies and controls to provide the required access while countering the
threats and vulnerabilities.
721.2 Context

This document fits into the structure of documents for Fujitsu Services (Pathway) Ltd
security as illustrated in figure 1-1 below.

The ACP defines the policies for controlling access to the Fujitsu Services (Pathway) Ltd IT
system in compliance with the Fujitsu Services (Pathway) Ltd Security Policy.

The Security Functional Specification (SFS) defines the security functionality that will be
incorporated into the Fujitsu Services (Pathway) Ltd system.

The Technical Environment Description (TED) describes the architecture and technical
environment for the Fujitsu Services (Pathway) Ltd solution.

Controlling access to IT resources requires a combination of physical controls and manual
procedures as well as controls in the IT system. Other documents define related policies,
procedures and processes, for example, for physical security of information (including the
procedures for entering a site and safeguarding manual records) as well as procedures for

using the system and handling security incidents. Other documents define how the various
Fujitsu Services (Pathway) Ltd components are configured.

2.31.3 Effect on other Fujitsu’ Services (Pathway) Ltd
Standards and Procedures

This Access Control Policy defines the policy for controlling access to resources in the
operational Fujitsu Services (Pathway) Ltd system. As explained in section 1.2, other
documents give more details of the technical solution and the associated policies and
procedures. The effect of the Access Control Policy on these other documents is:

2.34:11.3.1.1 Configuration documents should define how systems are configured to
conform to the ACP, for example, how the roles defined in the ACP are set up to
restrict access as required.

2.34.21.3.1.2 The roles defined in the ACP should be used in other standards and
procedures, not just information system controls. For example,

* where a role requires access to sensitive data, this should be reflected in the
level of vetting required for staff in that role.

© users in these roles must be formally registered and authorised to take that role
by the appropriate authority before being added to the IT system. Records of all
persons registered to use the system must be kept, though the way this is done
may be role or service dependent.

2.34.31.3.1.3 Where physical security and/or procedures are required to complement the IT
controls to provide the required level of access control, such procedures need to
conform to the ACP.

2.3441.3.1.4 The Fujitsu Services (Pathway) Ltd Security Manager will satisfy himself that
the procedures at the various Outlets are in compliance with the Fujitsu Services
(Pathway) Ltd security policies and specifications.

241.4 Scope and Document Structure

This Access Control Policy defines how access to information system resources is controlled
in the Fujitsu Services (Pathway) Ltd solution. It covers the Fujitsu Services (Pathway) Ltd
Data Centre systems; Fujitsu Services (Pathway) Ltd managed systems such as interface
systems at Post-Office-LtdPOL Outlets and closely related Fujitsu Services (Pathway) Ltd
project systems. Access may be the result of direct user action, or automatically initiated
activities.

The ACP contains:

and running these systems.

Separate internal Fujitsu Services (Pathway) Ltd documents also cover system development

and test systems and other activities prior to the handing over of the software for operational
use.

251.5 Access Control Policy Review

This document will be formally reviewed at least annually. It will also be reviewed where
relevant after a significant security incident, as part of a more general security policy review,
and updated whenever necessary.

Responsibilities for approval, review and issue of this document will conform to the review
procedure for Fujitsu Services (Pathway) Ltd policy and standards defined in the Fujitsu
Services (Pathway) Ltd Security Policy.

3.02.0 __ Outline of Services, Roles and Outlets

The Fujitsu Services (Pathway) Ltd system can be described from different views as follows:

© The operational systems and their business users.
© The business management users of the system, including security and auditing.
* Implementation systems used during rollout of new Post Office outlets.

© System & operational management and support.

This chapter gives an outline of the people and systems involved as a context for the policies
and roles described later. It is not intended as a complete description of the system - for that,

At the Data Centres, the main applications are on Sequent/UNIX systems, but the agents and
correspondence servers which handle distribution of information to and from the Post Office
outlets are on NT servers, as are most of the supporting systems such as the key management
systems. Post Office Systems are also NT.

Apart from at the Post Office outlets, all activities are automated in normal circumstances, so
there are no business users.

2__ Roles

At the Post Office counters, operational roles are the Post Office Manager, Supervisor and
Counter Clerk. These should be taken as also referring to the equivalent staff in franchises
and Sub Post Office outlets including Sub Postmasters and their staf.

The relleutOCMS database contains information about Post Office outlets where Fujitsu
Services (Pathway) Ltd is to be implemented, for example, Post Office details, the state of the
site and their staff training.

Configuration information comes mainly from the auto-configuration system and is used in
the initial set-up of the Post Office outlets, updating the generic set-up of the counter systems
as delivered, The auto-configuration process is very largely automated.

The help desk handles all technical calls from Post-Offee-LdDSSPOL and other Fujitsu
Services (Pathway) Ltd users including those from the Post Office requiring key and
password recovery services.

Fujitsu Services (Pathway) Ltd project sites include a Configuration Management system for
software to be distributed to Fujitsu Services (Pathway) Ltd systems, including Post Office
outlets. There are also test rigs used by application support staff for detecting and fixing bugs.

The technical help desk and system/operational management and support staff also use
intemal Fujitsu Services (Pathway) Ltd/Fujitsu Services support services such as the
Powerhelp and PinICL systems for recording, progressing and monitoring calls to the help
desk.

Note that many of the system and operational management and support staff are remote from
the systems being managed.

3.4.22.4.2__ Roles
The main roles are as follows:

¢ Operational Management (sometimes called System Administration): keeping the system
running where this is not carried out by system management. Operational management is
normally split into sub-roles, including:

¢ System set-up and installation: setting up the base and application software on the

system and configuring it for live running, including roles.

* Software update, where this is not automated via system management
Security/User administration: administering user security information such as their
authentication information, the roles they can perform and the groups they belong
to.

Database (e.g, Oracle) or Package (c.g. Riposte) administration

‘Computer operator: on most systems, this is a minimal role - switching on

machines, loading media and similar operations.

Other system administration functions

Note that some package administration is done by people supporting the

application users e.g. Discoverer and Business Objects are administered by

corporate management support staff.

‘¢ System Management: monitoring events and resources in the operational system and
taking appropriate action to rectify problems. Also, distributing software (complete new
packages or patches), where this is automated, for example, at the Post Office outlets. As
for operational management, sub-roles separate specific roles and also separate
administration of users and the Tivoli system itself.

Network Management: managing the network, including routers and firewalls, which

connect machines and Outlets together.

3.52.5 Fujitsu Services (Pathway) Ltd Sites and Interactions

The main Fujitsu Services (Pathway) Ltd services run at the secure Fujitsu Services
(Pathway) Ltd Data Centres at Wigan and Bootle. This includes the main operational
systems, most corporate management systems, some implementation systems and system &
network management ones as outlined in the previous sections.

The main operational and management services can be run at either site, if needed, though
there is a prime site for each. Figure 2-5 shows the sites with electronic links to the Fujitsu
Services (Pathway) Ltd Data Centres.

The main Fujitsu Services (Pathway) Ltd project sites that have access to the Data Centre
systems have secure LANs for that access with an encrypted link to the Data Centre. Where
people at these sites access other systems, including other sites, there are separate networks.
‘At some Fujitsu Services (Pathway) Ltd project sites (e.g. Feltham and Bracknell) there are
more complex networks which permit limited traffic to/from other controlled systems (for
example, for software distribution from the Configuration Management systems and
downloading of data to test rigs for investigating faults). In these cases, firewalls are used at
the project sites to control this traffic.

There are a number of other support and implementation sites with different types of access,
these are subject to different access control policies as appropriate for the site.

4.03.0 __ Overall Access Control Policies

This chapter identifies the overall access control policies and associated procedures and
controls, which apply across the Fujitsu Services (Pathway) Ltd solution. It gives the general
policies that apply across systems and identifies where variants and exceptions are permitted.
In these cases, the exceptions are defined in the appropriate sub-section of chapters 4 and 5
below. No other variants are permitted.

443.1 Introduction

The objectives in the Fujitsu Services (Pathway) Ltd Security Policy give the requirements
for confidentiality and integrity of data, whether in storage or in transit, and integrity of the
services and software components. The ACP defines the policies for controlling access in line
with these objectives.

4443.1.1 Fujitsu Services (Pathway) Ltd Human Roles

Human access to the Fujitsu Services (Pathway) Ltd information systems is specified in terms
of roles. People in specified roles are permitted to carry out defined functions and access
specified data. This is normally policed by controls within the information systems, though in
some cases, manual procedures are used to supplement these.

Fujitsu Services (Pathway) Ltd controls the roles people are allowed to perform, and which
functions they are allowed to carry out. However, users are individually identified so that
they can be made accountable for their actions.

Where practical, the same or similar roles are defined for several systems to reduce
complexity and make it easier to check compliance with the overall security policy.

The Access Control Policy includes all roles for users who have direct access to the Fujitsu
Services (Pathway) Ltd operational systems and the related systems at the Data Centres. In
addition, this document includes a limited number of roles of users who cause others to use
the system on their behalf, for example in response to a phone call.

Roles will normally be associated with major functions. Defining separate roles allows
different functions to be allocated to different individuals. However, the actual allocation of
roles to individuals is done by administrative action. Some users can be permitted to carry out
more than one major function, so are permitted to take more than one “role”, but this will not
be done where it might undermine security.

4:4.23.1.2 _ Types of Information and its Use

Information in the Fujitsu Services (Pathway) Ltd system to be protected from unauthorised
access includes:

The business data exchanged with Pest Office LtdPOL and its clients such as the reference
data to support EPOSS and the transaction data resulting from Post Office counter
activities.

Business data is transferred between Post Office Ltd, Post Office LidPOL, POL Clients
and the Fujitsu Services (Pathway) Ltd Data Centres and between the Data centres and the
Post Office outlets. It is stored at the main operation systems and also in archives. Some
data is also available for management services at the Data Warehouse.

Fujitsu Services (Pathway) Ltd business management data - financials, service level
agreements etc. There are confidentiality and integrity requirements for much of this data.
This data is collected from the operational systems to the MIS ones, and information
extracted to Fujitsu Services (Pathway) Ltd project Outlets and forwarded to Post Office
EtdPOL and Clients.

Other data supporting the business processes such as training data (special, non-sensitive,
business style data used in training sessions) and on-line documentation e.g. Post Office
procedures.

Operational systems data such as the software, configuration information, Tivoli scripts,
system management event logs etc.

This data is mainly held at the Data Centre and other systems, and accessed remotely from
system management and support Outlets

Security information about users, keys, security audit logs ete

Most processing of the business information, except at the Post Office Outlet, is automated
and therefore not subject to human access. Most processing of system data is also automated.

All information is protected in conformance to the Security Functional Specification and
Fujitsu Services (Pathway) Ltd Security Policy.
423.2 General Principles

The following general principles should be followed in controlling access to the Fujitsu
Services (Pathway) Ltd systems.

4.2443.2.

The principle of “least privilege” should apply to restrict the access rights of
users. (This may be applied through a mixture of technical and procedural
controls.)

424.23.2.1.2 Duties of different users should be separated to minimise the damage that any
‘one user can do to the system or the information in it.

4.2.4.33.2.1.3 If a role at a particular location is allocated to a single person, there should
generally be at least one other person who can deputise for that person. (At small
Post Office outlets where no deputy is available, and the Post Office Manager is
unavailable, the Post Office Outlet will not open until emergency procedures have
been invoked.)

4.2.4.43.2.1.4 Where possible, the operation of Fujitsu Services (Pathway) Ltd should be
automated to reduce the need for human intervention and the potential accidental
and malicious security breaches resulting from human activity. For example,
applications should be designed to reduce the human interaction needed and jobs
should be scheduled automatically as the result of files being received or at a
particular time.

5 Similarly, where practical, system management tasks should be automated;
including taking remedial action where the results of monitoring the system show
this is needed. Only where action cannot be taken automatically, or human
verification of an action is needed, should human intervention be required.

Note that this Access Control Policy covers access by system entities as well as human users,
but do not define roles for them.

4.33.3 Human Access

This section contains the policies for how human access to the Fujitsu Services (Pathway) Ltd
systems is controlled. It is divided into sub-section for policies on:

Authentication to prove the user’s identity to the IT system, and hence his right to take on
a particular role, and access particular resources

User registration’ administration to establish and maintain the user’s identity and security
attributes (such as role, password)
Authentication of visitors

Authentication by telephone
© Control of human access to resources (see also 3.5)

4343.3.1 Authentication to IT Systems

4.3443.3.1.1 All users must be authenticated to the IT system. This must identify them as
individuals. (The few permitted exceptions to this policy are in chapter 4)

4,34,23.3.1.2 People accessing Fujitsu Services (Pathway) Ltd systems are required to
identify themselves using hand held tokens if:

© They are at sites remote from the Data Centre and can update operational or
MIS systems (for example, to perform systems management actions)

They can access Pest Office LtgPOL business data (except at Post Office
outlets),

They are authorised to update system data, which can affect the running of the
Fujitsu Services (Pathway) Ltd systems. This includes people who have UNIX
root privilege, NT users belonging to the administrator’s group and database
administrators.

4,3:4.33.3.1.3 Where such tokens are used for authentication, the associated PIN must be at
least 6 characters long.

[TITLE \* MERGEFORMAT I Ref: RS/POL/003,
Version: 3.4
[SUBJECT \* MERGEFORMAT ] Date: 18-FEB-2002

4.3-4-43.3.1.4 Each user will have an individually allocated token except in emergencies, for
example, when a token is lost. In such cases, specific authentication will be
agreed.

4.34,53.3. Where a user needs to authenticate to multiple systems/domains in one
session, the first authentication (normally to the local workstation) should be with

a token.

4,34.63.3.1.6 If a user who authenticates with a token to one system/domain needs to
perform an additional authentication to another system, the second authentication
should also be a token based one, using the same token. Agreed exceptions to this
must be documented.

4,34.93.3.1.7 Where passwords are used for authentication, the user is forced to change the
initial password before any other access to the system is permitted.

4.3.4,83.3.1.8 Passwords will expire in 30 days unless otherwise stated (in the section on the
appropriate domain).

4.34.93.3.1.9 Re-use of the same password is not permitted for either a specified time or
until at least 3 other passwords have been used.

434403.3.1.10 The minimum password length is 6 characters and there cannot be
more than two consecutive identical characters. The password cannot be the same
as the username.

434H13.3.1.11 After 3 consecutive unsuccessful attempts to log-on, the user is locked
out unless otherwise stated.

4.34.123.3.1.12 Users are authenticated with their individual usernames on first
accessing the system. A change to use another username will only be permitted to
certain authorised operational management roles in exceptional circumstances as
specified in the appropriate later section (for example, for Sequent systems in
4.2.2), Any change to use another username must be controlled and audited in a
way that will always be recorded.

13____An operational management role may need full system administrator
access to the system in limited circumstances. In this case, where possible, the
user should be given limited privileges on log-on and have to ask for other
authorised, but potentially wide ranging, privileges when required. In particular,
no user is allowed to log onto UNIX with root access (though some may be
permitted a controlled change to root access later).

43.23.3.2 _User Registration and Administration

4.3.243.3.2.1 People must be identified to Fujitsu Services (Pathway) Ltd information
system as individuals, Users with direct access to the system should be registered
as follows.

© Ifaccessing the system via a package such as Oracle or Tivoli, they are
registered with that package.
¢ Users who require direct access to the operating system are registered with that
operating system (at the local system or NT domain)
© Users requiring token authentication are also registered with the appropriate
authentication service.
(The only exceptions allowed to this are the specific cases identified in later sections of this
document, In these limited exceptional cases, the user, for example, an engineer, is identified
as an individual using manual means prior to using the system in a way specially set up for
this, and where the use of the system is suitably monitored.)

43.33. Authentication of Visitors to Post Office outlets and Fujitsu
Services (Pathway) Ltd Sites

4.3343.3.

All visitors to both Fujitsu Services (Pathway) Ltd and Post Office Outlets
who need access to the IT system must have a company identity card which
includes their photograph, signature and pass number.

4,3.3.23.3.3.2_Unless otherwise stated, for all such visits, the pass number of the visitor must
be notified in advance to the relevant manager; access will not be permitted if this
has not been done, However, Auditors may visit Post Office outlets and other
Outlets without prior notice to the Post Office Manager.

4.3.3.33.3.3.3 Fujitsu Services (Pathway) Ltd visitors to Post Office outlets must be subject
to Fujitsu Services (Pathway) Ltd vetting procedures and approval by Horizon.

Visitors to Fujitsu Services (Pathway) Ltd Outlets are subject to agreed vetting
procedures.

Telephone Authentication at Help Desks
‘Authentication by telephone is needed at the Help Desks:Desks.

All the Help Desks receive calls from Customers, Post-Office-LidPOL staff at Post Office
outlets and other people such as Fujitsu Services (Pathway) Ltd staff. The following
categories of call have different authentication requirements:

© Category 1: Calls where the source of call would not affect the action taken. For example,
the call is just a query of generally available information.

Fujitsu Services [TITLE \* MERGEFORMAT I Ref RS/POL/003,
Version: 3.4
[SUBJECT \* MERGEFORMAT ] Date: 18-FEB-2002

Category 2: Where the result of the call is to cause an action which has only limited
consequences e.g. to report a problem in the Post Office outlet (which could result in an
engineer call).

Category 3: Where the consequences of misidentifying of the caller can be serious and the
telephone authentication is the only authentication of the caller. For example, the wrong
person may be allowed access to sensitive information, and/or be able to disrupt the
service.

Category 4: Where the consequences of the call could potentially be serious, but
authentication of the user on the phone is only part of the process needed to complete an
action. For example, a Post Office Manager has lost the PIN associated with the card used
to boot the system, but will still also require a password to use the system.

4.3.413.3.4.1 For category I calls, no authentication is needed.

43.4.23.3.4.2 For category 2 calls made, for example, by Pest Office LtaPOL staff, at least
the location of the caller should be verified, for example, the particular Post Office
outlet, or Post-Office LtaPOL regional centre. This location must be one already
known to the Help Desk for which suitable verification information is available.

4:3.4.33.3.4.3 For category 3 calls, the caller must be identified individually. (If the person
concemed is not known individually to the Help Desk, the call must be routed via
a known centre for verification. For example, calls from Post Office staff at the
Outlet could be routed via a Post-Office LtaPOL regional centre whose staff
authenticate to the Fujitsu Services (Pathway) Ltd Help Desk.)

4,3-443.3.4.4 For category 4 calls, the authentication process should at least verify the
location of the call to one known and acceptable for this type of call.

43.4.53.3.

Help Desks must maintain the information required authenticating the callers
and their Outlets/offices as required for the type of call.

4:3:4-63.3. If the call needs to be passed onto another internal Fujitsu Services (Pathway)
Ltd help desk, the call should be forwarded only after the initial authentication has
been carried out.

43.4.73.3.

There are several different types of calls in each category. The authentication
process for each call type must conform to these policies.

Details of the information used for different types of call must conform to these policies and
be given in the appropriate Help Desk procedures.

43.53.3.5 Control of Human Access to Resources

Controls of access to resources areis achieved partly by workstation set-up and partly by
administration of the resource, for example, in the form of an access control list. Details of
the way the access controls are implemented in the information systems depend on the
product used and are not defined in this policy document.

4.3.543.3.5.1_ All human users with access to Fujitsu Services (Pathway) Ltd Data Centre or
Fujitsu Services (Pathway) Ltd managed systems on other sites must do so using
controlled workstations as defined in 3.6.1.

4,3.5.23.3.5.2_ Access controls associated with resources should define the “role” of the user,
not the individual user’s identity (unless there is an agreed need for individual
access). The role may be represented by a group identity, for example, in products
such as Riposte, UNIX and Windows NT, which support groups, not roles
direetly.

4.3.533,3.5.3 Access controls associated with resources should provide access to the
resources as in the role definitions in chapter 6,

4.43.4 Non Human Users

As much of the operational Fujitsu Services (Pathway) Ltd system is automated, some users
are system, not human users, so there are usernames and passwords for both types of users. In
general, system users should be subject to the controls specified above (c.g. for password
protection), as such usernames generally cannot be confined to human users only, so human
users can potentially access usernames intended for system users. However, some
differences are permitted.

4e4cL13.4.1.1 The username and password used to automate the login may be held in clear if
it is only accessible to authorised operational management staff for that system

and the potential damage from mis-use of that username is minimised.

4-4:1.23.4.1.2 The password may expire less frequently than the 30 days for human users
where suitably obscure passwords are used, and the risk of external access to such
accounts is very low.

4.53.5 Information and Resource Access

The Fujitsu Services (Pathway) Ltd Access Control Policy is concerned with protecting
information in all Fujitsu Services (Pathway) Ltd systems at the Data Centres, at Fujitsu
Services (Pathway) Ltd managed systems (such as interface systems at Post-Office-LidPOL
and other Outlets), at the systems used to access Data Centre and managed systems and in
transit between these. This includes protection of information during fault investigations and
correction and information retained for auditing and fraud investigation.

4,54-43.5.1.1 Where human access to sensitive information is needed, it should only be
accessible to those with a need to see it according to their role.

Information in transit between systems should be encrypted for confidentiality
and/or integrity according to the needs of the particular link as defined in the
Security Functional Specification [SFS].

4,5.4.33.5.1.3 Digital signatures should be used for integrity of business information between
the Post Office outlets and other services where required. For example, for signing
automated payments at the Post Office Outlet prior to transmission via Fujitsu
Services (Pathway) Lid to Post Office Lid-or Post Offiee LtdPOL or POL Clients.

4.54-43.5.1.4 System data should also be integrity protected when required. For example,
digital signatures protect software distributed to the Post Office outlets and
elsewhere.

5 Business information in filestore at the Post Office PCs should be encrypted.

4,51.63.5.1.6 Passwords should be stored in encrypted form separately from application data
and executable code, except for the specific cases listed in Non Human Access
above.

7 Fujitsu Services (Pathway) Ltd systems should prevent human users
interfering with each other or with the automated applications and should prevent
applications interfering with each other.

8 Information should be appropriately separated in filestore, database tables etc.
Each data set should be accessible only to those with a need for that access.

Different applications should run in their own user names or that of the user
calling them (or at the Post Office Outlet, in the Riposte username impersonating
the user).

4.54103: 0 Access to shared resources such as filestore should be controlled by:

* Access to that filestore being restricted to a specific product which is available
only to authorised users, or

© Access to those resources being restricted to users in specified roles. (Group ids
may be used to represent roles. Access control lists using these will ensure that
only authorised people can access the resource).

4.$4143.5.1.11 Information in relational databases should be accessible only via
authorised client “applications” (such as Oracle Forms, Discoverer, Business
Objects, Tivoli database interfaces) except where there is a proven need for lower
level access. Lower level access will only be granted for agreed operational
management and support functions.

1.12 __ System Management actions by Tivoli should be activated using pre-

defined Tivoli tasks authorised for use by SMC and the Fujitsu Services
(Pathway) Ltd configuration management and software distribution process. This
includes collection of diagnostic information from the Post Office Outlet for
application support.

454433.5.1.13 Packages (such as Oracle and Tivoli) and applications above the
operating system must also conform to the Access Control Policy. For example,
Oracle should restrict users to the authorised tables and views. Also, access to the
package’s resources should use role based access controls.

454443.5.1.14 For client-server applications (such as Oracle Forms ones), audit
records should be generated at the server so audit logs do not rely on input from
workstations.

4.Sc.153.5.1.15 Security audit logs must be protected from everyone except those
permitted to take specified Security Event Auditor roles. Unless otherwise
specified for a particular domain (such as the Post Office outlets), the security-
auditing role is separate from other roles at that domain.

4,514163.5.1.16 All systems, except Post Office counter systems, must provide read
‘access to audit trails by authorised security auditors.

45.23.5.2 Key Management

Cryptography is used widely in Fujitsu Services (Pathway) Ltd as described in the Security

Functional Specification [SFS] for:

© Protecting information on links for confidentiality, integrity and origin authentication in
line with the requirements for that link.

«End-to-end integrity and data origin authentication, potentially over multiple links using
digital signatures.

Filestore encryption at the Post Office Outlet.

The following policies apply for protection of keys.
45243.

CESG approved keys must be protected in line with CESG requirements.

4,5:2.23.5.2.2 Key material (symmetric keys, DSA private keys and DSA entropy) should be
held in clear only when in physically secure environments.

4,5.2.33.5.2.3 Public keys (except for the CA’s public key) should be held in certificates
"signed by the Certification Authority.

4,5.2.43.5.2.4 Symmetric keys should only be stored where necessary, and be held securely.

4.5.2.53.5.2.5 Keys (or part keys) held in filestore must be in separate filestore accessible
only to authorised key custodians via authorised applications.

4.5.2.63.5.

Keys used for protecting data should not be resident in filestore in clear.

4.5.2.93.5.2.7 Keys should be changed periodically according to CESG policy. Different
periods may apply to Symmetric Keys used for encrypting data, Key Encryption
Keys (KEKs) used to encrypt other keys and Certification Authority keys.

4.5.2.83.5.2.8 New KEKs should not be distributed solely under the protection of existing
KEKs.

9 Key material in transit electronically must be encrypted (except for CHAP
keys between the routers within the Fujitsu Services (Pathway) Ltd Data Centre
LAN).

45.2403.5.2.10 Cryptographic keys and Key Encryption Keys are either installed
locally at the machine where they are to be used, or are distributed electronically
using an approved protocol which protects these keys in transit.

Where a key is delivered in two parts (e.g. a red key and a black key),
the parts should be delivered by different routes.

The key (or part key) to be handled manually must be held in a locked
safe when not in use. Access to this must be authorised and recorded in
conformance with Fujitsu Services (Pathway) Ltd procedures.

4.63.6 System Set-up Policies
4,643.61 Workstation Set-up Policies

4.6c1-13.6.1.1 Users with interactive access to Fujitsu Services (Pathway) Ltd systems should
use “controlled, NT workstations” as defined in the following policies in this
section. All such exceptions to the “controlled NT” workstation policy must be
authorised and documented in the ACP.

4.6:1.23.6.1.2 Workstations from which operational systems can be updated should have
floppy drives disabled. Booting from CDROM should also be disabled once a
system has been configured. In all cases, exceptions to this rule must be agreed

5.04.0 ___ Specific Human Access Controls
$44.1 Introduction

This chapter covers where the access control policies, and in particular, authentication
policies, in chapter 3 for human users are specialised for particular roles and where
exceptions to these policies are permitted.

Note that a full list of Fujitsu Services (Pathway) Ltd roles, outlining the IT access permitted
to each of them, is given in chapter 6.

§.24.2 Post Office Outlets — Operational and Implementation
Roles

There are no system management and support roles at the Post Office outlets, as these tasks
are run remotely, apart from some limited tasks available to Post Office managers.
5.244.2.1 Post Office Normal Running

For normal functions, Post Office Managers, clerks and supervisors authenticate using a
Riposte username and password.

On normal counter start up (once installation is complete), the Post Office Manager (or
authorised other user) uses the Post Office Memory card and PIN (which is also used in
protecting the filestore, as defined in the [SFS]}).

The following specialisations of the policies in chapter 3 apply in these cases.
S.2b14.2.1.1_A password cannot be re-used for 18 months.

S.2cl-24.2.1.2 The password is checked to conform to quality standards as follows:

© The password cannot contain spaces
© The password cannot be one of an agreed “excluded passwords” list.

5.2:4.34.2.1.3 After a period of inactivity at a Post Office counter, the session will time out,
but can be resumed on entry of the password. After a longer period of inactivity,
the user is forcibly logged out.

5.24.44.2.1.4 The PIN used for the Post Office Manager’s memory card is a 15 character
alphanumeric value

5.24,54.2.1.5 The Post Office Manager should secure the Memory card and PEN—for
ciated PIN in separate places

5.2:4,64.2.1.6 When a new Post Office user is added to the system, a full name must be
supplied, so that the user can be identified from the user name included in the
transaction logged in the Riposte journals.

Customer Authentication at Post Office Outlets

For most Post Office operations, customers do not need to authenticate themselves.-fis-+here

$234.23 Post Office Exceptional Cases except
Implementation/Installation

This subsection includes exceptional cases involving the Post Office Manager and other Post
Office staff and also supports engineers, Post-Office-LtdPOL auditors and emergency
managers.

For some user groups, and some exceptional circumstances, the Post Office Manager (or
other authorised person) authenticates using a one-time password with the assistance of the
Horizon System Help Desk (HSHD). The Post Office system generates a value, then phones
the HSHD authenticating to the HSHD as defined for that user role/circumstances (see
[ACUA PPD)). The HSHD (after authenticating the user) provides a check value that the user
can type in at the Post effieeOflice counter to authenticate himself.

The following policies apply to these exceptions.

5.2.3:14.2.3.1 If there is a failure on booting the counter systems afer installation of new
software, the Post Office Manager then reverts to the failsafe version of NT
supported by HSHD and using a one-time password.

5.2.3.24.2.3.2 If the Manager loses his password, he (or an authorised deputy in his absence)
logs into a SUPPORT username using a one-time password provided via the
HSHD.

5.2.3.34.2.3.3 If the Manager loses his card or PIN, he obtains an emergency recovery key
via the HSHD (after authenticate to the HSHD).

5.2.3.44.2.3.4 Support engineers (installing new hardware and running tests to check it) and
‘Auditors use generic Riposte usernames for the appropriate role and authenticate
via one-time passwords. For both engineers and auditors, the pass number is also
typed in; so individual users can be identified in the log.

$.2.3.54.2.3.5 If a Pest-Office-LidPOL Emergency Manager takes over a Post office when
the manager is unavailable or unco-operative, he may use the emergency recovery
procedure to boot up the Post Office — see 4.2.3.3.

5.2.4:14.2.4.1 The installation engineer must authenticate to the POM (see Visitor
Authentication) prior to using the Auto-configuration application. Authentication
to NT or Riposte must be impossible at this stage.

5.2:4.24.2.4.2 On first installation of the Post Office (after memory card set-up), the
Manager logs in under the Set-up Manager username to create his individual
username. He then logs in using this, and deletes the Set-up Manager username.
On all future occasions, the POM must authenticate using his individual user
name except in cases identified in 4.2.3 above.

3 For migrating manual records, the POM should check the HFSO’s credentials
and create a MiMAN user including the HFSO’s name. The HSFO authenticates
to that (using a shared HFSO password) under POM control and should only have
access to the migration application. After migration, the POM and HSFO should
check the name details are correct and the POM should then delete the migration
account.

Corporate (including Security) Management Users

Unless stated otherwise, all corporate management users are authenticated to their local NT
domain using a security token, They use controlled NT workstations on secure LANs at
Fujitsu Services (Pathway) Ltd project Sites linked by encrypted links to the Data Centres
(see site type 1 in 3.6.3).

5.3.14. Business Management

These users may also need to authenticate to the relevant system and/or application for
particular systems. This is required for Oracle applications, and for Business Object universes
used to access data at Data Warchouse systems via Oracle/Business objects.

The only specialisations and exceptions to the policies in chapter 3 for these users are:

5.3-4-44.3.1.1 People in the following roles have CDs at workstations with write access:

© Management support users, who write agreed warehouse data to CD for

5.3.2.24.3.2.2 The Key Custodian uses the local console at the platform where the key is to
be installed/changed and authenticates using a token to the local system. (For NT,
this is defined as a local role)

5.3.2.4.3.2.3 The Key Handler has the key on the appropriate media (e.g. floppy) for re-
installation of the key during system reboot. He is not a known user of the system

Procedures for getting in Support Staff

A number of problems can lead to staff being required to support the system. This could be
FSCS or SSC staff coming in to support the system from their normal support sites. However,
it could also require support staff from other organisations such as Sequent or Cisco. FSCS is
generally responsible for the call out procedures.

S.S.3.44.

1_All requests for technical support should be made to the Horizon System Help
esk. The identity of the caller requesting support (if by telephone) should be
verified to ensure the call comes from an appropriate source, so can be acted on.
The Help Desk will pass on the call to the appropriate unit in line with Help Desk
Procedures using the call handling system.

5.5.3:.24.5.3.2 All support calls should be recorded in the call handling system and their

progress reported there, including who was called out and the actions taken.

5.5.3:34.5.3.3 Routers will by default be configured to prevent access from support
organisations other than the standard OSD Outlets supporting Fujitsu Services
(Pathway) Ltd. When support is required from another authorised site (e.g.
Sequent or Cisco), a router should be configured to allow this access, and then re-
configured to disallow it after use.

55.44.54 Software Distribution and Exceptions for Fixes

5.5414.5.4.1 All software (new software and fixes) must be registered in the configuration
management system controlled by configuration librarians. It should be tested
using test rigs and authorised by the CS Release Manager prior to distribution by
Software Distributors.

may sometimes be forwarded to 3rd/4th line support units, which may include application
suppliers.

Note that no application support users have access to Post Office counter systems — errors
here are diagnosed using logs of events extracted via Tivoli.

Centre must do so using NT controlled workstations in a secure workstation
environment as defined in 3.2.3.3. (For SSC, the secure environment must include
a firewall to restrict traffic between the test rigs and the secure LAN, though the
workstation gives access to both Data Centres and test rigs.)

where this is required to assist in diagnosing application problems and testing new
software to fix the problem.

corupted by faulty code.)
Correction of data must be subject to agreed authorisation procedures.

© FSCS operational management staff that will fast fix code, when authorised,
under controlled conditions.
Where time permits, correction of errors should be by re-issue of a new version
of the software via the Configuration management system, When faster fixing
is required, agreed Fujitsu Services (Pathway) Ltd authorisation procedures
must be followed. For applications supported by SSC, this will start with a
request by SSC.

In all cases, updates to code or data by application support staff require two
tail to be present when the change is made and all such changes to be audited,
identifying what has been changed (before and after values) and the individual
who made the change.

6.05.0 _ Specific System Access Controls
6A5.1 Introduction

This chapter covers cases where the access control policies in chapter 3 are specialised for
particular systems-Andsystems and where exceptions to these policies are permitted.

In addition to the policies in chapter 3, all systems should support the roles in chapter 6, with
only the required functions and resources available as defined there with the human access
controls defined in chapter 4.

Note: the ACP does not cover internal systems such as Powerhelp and PinICL.

6:2: Post Office outlets Platforms

A multi-counter Post Office has a local LAN with NT workstations, one of which is the
gateway with a link to the Fujitsu Services (Pathway) Ltd Data Centres.

§.2.1_Human Users (Formatted: Bullets and Numbering )

The roles supported are Post Office staff (Post Office Manager, counter clerk and supervisor),
Customer (indirectly), Pest-Offiee-LtdPOL Auditors and Emergency managers, Engineers
(support and installation engineers) and Horizon Field support Officers (see 4.1, 4.2 and 4.4).

6.2.4.15.2.1.1_At no stage afier leaving the factory should it be possible to logon directly to
Windows NT or for a user to access NT functions or data.

6.2:4:25.2.1.2 No operational management roles should be supported at the Post Office
systems, or any other roles apart from than those listedin-S.2 above.

6225.22 Factory Set-up Controls

Software is installed at the factory (though may be updated on installation) and initial
configuration done.

5.2.3:45.2.3.3 After a user has logged on using Riposte, all access to the system should be
controlled by Riposte — the Riposte desktop should allow access to only those
items available to people in the user’s role. The user must not be able to call any
other applications or NT functions or resources. No direct access to Windows NT
should be possible at any time, even for engineers.

5.2.3.4 The Riposte infrastructure should not need NT administrator privilege.
635.3 Sequent Systems

3.1

Introduction

Sequent systems with Dynix operating system and Oracle databases are used for the main
operational applications (see 2.1) and the Data Warehouse (see 2.2) at the Data Centres. The
systems also have data in flat files (e.g. before/after transfer to/from other systems).

63.25.3.2 Human Access

5.3.2.LAll Sequent systems support the operational management and support roles listed in--——(Formatted: Bullets and Numbering J

chapter 6, They also support application roles for the particular applications such as ODBC,
RDMC and Business Objects for access to Data Warehouse data.

6,3.245.3.2.1 All business users (such as the Business Support unit) should use Oracle
applications — Oracle Forms, Business Objects or Discover 2000.

6,3.2.25.3.2.2 Where the SQL*Net access to the database could potentially give more access
than that permitted for thatthe business role, the application at the client must
restrict access to that permitted. Also, a secure controlled workstation conforming
to Fujitsu Services (Pathway) Ltd policies (see 3.2) must be used and the user
identified there with the correct role so that the application controls cannot be by-
passed.

6.3.2.35.3.2.3 Users just using Oracle via applications on their controlled workstations

should be registered to the Oracle application, not the underlying operating

system, and authenticate using a password.

6.3.245,3.2.4 Where users need to be both UNIX and Oracle users, they should be registered
in UNIX, and have Oracle use the result of the UNIX (and security token)
authentication.

6-3-2-55,3.2.5 Oracle database administration functions should use:

¢ Patrol for monitoring the database

* Pre-defined Discover queries to examine the state of the database. (Discoverer
should be configured to restrict access to the tables and views needed for the
task and audit actions.)

¢ Pre-defined, authorised SQL*Plus for database updates (which should include
auditing)

6,3.2.65.3.2.6 Application support users of Oracle should use:
© Discover queries to examine the data
© Pre-defined forms for correcting standard types of data problem
© Pre-authorised SQL*Plus scripts for correcting other data problems
Alll pre-defined forms and pre-authorised scripts should audit the correction made.

632-753.

Users who require any access to operating system facilities must do so via a
secure menu system that restricts the user to functions authorised for users of that
role (and audits all functions performed by that user).

3.2.8 Where a function called from the secure menu system requires a change of
username, that change should be done automatically by the menu system and
audited. Changes to username must also cause a Patrol event.

The secure menu system should have specific functions for most system
management activities. However, for emergency use, the menu will include an
item that provides root access and use of UNIX commands.

Computer operators access Sequent systems from the console, using
the secure menu system to access a limited number of predefined jobs such as
back-ups.

Engineering access when the operating system cannot be fully booted,
is via “single user mode” under controlled conditions (see Visitor Authentication
and Engineering Access). Single user mode should only be used when more
controlled methods are not possible.

63.2425,3.2.12 Operational management staff always authenticates under their own
names to UNIX and perform functions wherever possible without superuser/root
privileges. If root is needed, the appropriate menu item on the secure menu system
will be used to switch users. This will be audited and an alert sent to BMC Patrol
so a record remains available even if the audit log at the UNIX machine is
subsequently corrupted.

63.2435.3.2.13 Where non-Fujitsu Services (Pathway) Ltd, e.g. Sequent staff provide
3rd line support, this may be from the 3rd party site. In this case, access must be
from a controlled NT workstation and controlled environment as for Fujitsu
Services (Pathway) Ltd operational management - see 3.2. Call in procedures are
asin 4.5.3.

63:24145.3.2.14 As Sequent requires root access, an independent monitoring system
will be used where all key strokes on the Sequent workstation are captured and
echoed on a FSCS workstation.

6-3.24155.3.2.15 Application support managers can correct application data subject to
authorisation procedures — see 4.5.5. For Oracle applications, this should, where
possible, be via specific functions available to the Oracle SSC role. In exceptional
circumstances, use of SQL*Plus scripts will be authorised after checking. For
other services, this may involve updates to flat files. In all cases, corrections to the
data are audited.

3 Application/Oracle Roles at the Operational Sequent Systems

6,3.345.3.3.1 Database roles with appropriate database views/tables should be used to
separate what data is available to whom

6-3:3:25,3.3.2 The following Oracle roles should be defined for all Oracle applications on the
operational Sequent servers. Note that in some cases, people with different human
roles in the list in chapter 6 may have the same access to the same Oracle role.

Oracle role I Functions, and roles

MONITOR Read only access to application data in this database
- used by Auditors, application support etc

AUDITOR ‘As MONITOR plus access to audit information

- used by auditors

CFM_DBA _I Full dba privileges

ssc As for MONITOR, plus limited updates, implemented by
pre-defined, authorised forms

BSU Specific business support functions on OBCS and some

other applications - see chapter 6.

6.3.3.35,3.3.3 Other application roles should be defined for particular applications to support
the application roles listed in chapter 6, for example, Reference Data roles at
RDMC.

6,3:3.45.3.3.4 Information available to people doing ad-hoc queries should be further
constrained e.g. using Business Object universes

Note that there are also roles for non-human users.

63.45.34 Dynix and Oracle Access Controls

6.3.4.15.3.4.1 The Dynix operating system should be set-up according to the access control
policy in 3 above.

6,3-4.25.3.4.2 Automated processes should do all loading/unloading of data to/from Oracle
databases. Separate interface tables should be used to restrict the damage possible
due to failures during automated processes.

6:3:4.35.3.4.3 The set-up of the system should be regularly monitored, for example, to check
for dormant accounts and to review any changes made to important system files.

645.4 Windows NT Systems

This section covers NT workstations and servers at the Data Centres and other Fujitsu
Services (Pathway) Ltd managed NT systems except the Post Office outlets. NT workstations
at secure Fujitsu Services (Pathway) Ltd management and support Sites should also conform
to these policies, and the NT domain policies.

6415.4.1 Generic NT Policies

NT systems support the operational management and support roles listed in chapter 6 unless
other-wise stated.

As on other systems, engincers should only have controlled access and must
be accompanied by FSCS staff when using the system.

2 Apart from event logs etc, which are relevant to all NT systems, application
support users should access application databases via relevant tools, rather than
just operating system facilities.

.1.3_AII NT servers should be set up with a group and template user for the generic
management and support roles (plus any others defined for the particular NT
system). These templates should be used when a user is assigned to a role to set up
that user with the required user profile providing access to only those tools needed
to carry out the role.

6-4:1-45.4.1.4 While use of NT domains allows a user to log in once to multiple servers,
some roles (such as Engineer and Key Custodian) should always be defined as
requiring the user to be local at the machine.

64.25.42 _NT Domain Policies

Windows NT domains are used in Fujitsu Services (Pathway) Ltd to control which NT
servers can share NT resources and which users have access to those resources. They are also
used to simplify user authentication — a user need only logon once to a domain, or once to a
set of domains, which have an established trust relationship, which includes trust in the users
of the domains.

Fujitsu Services [TITLE \* MERGEFORMAT I Ref RS/POL/003,
Version: 3.4
[SUBJECT \* MERGEFORMAT ] Date: 18-FEB-2002

NT domains should conform to the following policies:

NT domains should generally have at least one Backup Domain Controller.
should be on a separate site from the Primary Domain Controller. Exceptions
to this must be agreed and are expected to be smail domains with few users.

Where a set of related NT systems is run by a different authority from other
NT systems, this should be set up as a separate domain.

6-4.2.35.4.2.3 Where such a domain does not share users or resources with other domains, it
should be a separate domain with no trust relationship with other domains. For
example, the Payment Card Helpline systems are such a domain.

.2.4 Domains may span Sites where all NT workstations and servers in the domain
are run by the same authority and are subject to the same physical and network
security. (For example, the SMC system management domain spans the SMC
workstations attached to a secure LAN on the secure SMC Site and the Tivoli NT
servers at the Data Centre).

A domain must be confined within an area of the network, which is subject to
the same security policies and controls. For example, it must not include NT
systems on different sides of a firewall.

6 Where sharing of resources, but not users, is required between domains, then
the trust between domains should be restricted to sharing the agreed
resources/files across the domain boundary. The resource sharing must be
restricted to the minimum required for the agreed functions.

642.95.4.2.7 Where sharing of files is required between domains on different sides of a
firewall, this should be subject to special authorisation procedures as well as the
policy above.

642.85.4.

A domain should not establish trust in users registered in a domain in a less
trusted part of the network.

642.95.4.2.9 Users should only have access to the NT systems to which they are permitted
access. The domain set up should prevent them accessing any other NT systems.

642405.4.2.10 Users should not be registered as NT users at domains where their only
access is at the application level, for example, viafrom a remote client via an
application protocol to a particular application that has its own logon.

6424154211 Set up of NT domains should assist separation of systems to reduce
interference between them.

6435.43 Correspondence Servers

6.4.3:15.4.3.1 Business Support and Auditor access to the operational Correspondence
servers should be restricted to exceptional circumstances for limited amounts of
data (as otherwise, the performance of the system could be impaired). In all cases,
access should be controlled, and limited to use of a specific agreed query tool.

Security Servers on NT

Security services on NT are:

* A Key Management Application (KMA) which (generates and) distributes cryptographic
keys to Fujitsu Services (Pathway) Ltd services and the Post Office outlets. An associated

Certification Authority (CA) generates public key certificates and Entropy servers that
generate DSA entropy for digital signatures.

The VPN servers used for protection of the traffic to Post Office outlets

The audit and key management workstations supporting the Fujitsu Services (Pathway)
Ltd security manager and his staff

Signing servers to sign software and auto-configuration information sent to the Post
officeOflice Outlet.

(This is in addition to the software security services to protect data in transit on particular
links.)

6.4.415.4.4.1 The Certification Authority Workstation (CAW) that includes the CA should
be off-line — not connected to any network.

6:4:4.25.4.4.2. The KMA should store all keys encrypted, and the key used to encrypt these
keys should be subject to the normal KEK policies — see 3.5.

64435.4.4.3 Application level access to the KMA should be restricted to the agreed
functions for each of the specified roles, and each role should have the least
privilege needed to do the job. All security significant actions should be audited.

64445.4.4.4 On-line interactive access by human users to the NT server on which the
KMA resides should not be generally possible. It should require approval by the
Fujitsu Services (Pathway) Ltd Security Manager to permit this access (except for
key handling on reboot). The access will only ever be permitted for:

© Read only access by application support staff (updates should always be via the
standard Tivoli software distribution)

© Limited, authorised, system admin access by local users??-Dba-auditer.

addition, files for different systems (e.g. TIP, Royal Mail and Reference Data) are
separated.

6.95.9 System Management Servers

A set of Tivoli system management servers are used to manage the Post Office systems and
related Data Centre NT systems (mainly using Tivoli products). They also monitor other
Fujitsu Services (Pathway) Ltd management systems and collect event data from other
systems also.

6,9415.9.1.1 All users of Tivoli must be registered at the Tivoli server and associated with
the appropriate roles, groups (and regions) to restrict their access to facilities,
which they are permitted to access. (All such users have security tokens, so are
also registered with an Authentication Service)

6.94.25.9.1.2_In addition to SMC roles, Tivoli servers should also support:

© Fujitsu Services (Pathway) Ltd Security Auditors with read access to audit
information via the web interface — platform audit logs, Tivoli notices, and
Tivoli events collected for auditing.

© Application support users with access to Pre-authorised Tivoli tasks to extract
diagnostic information from the Post Office.

also need to log onto UNIX for access to authorised OpenView and Cisco Works/View
functions.
‘As well as NMS roles, there is also Cisco router support roles. Engineers may also require
direct access to routers.
There are no on-line application support roles. Support of Open View, Cisco Works etc is
done off-line. Fujitsu Services (Pathway) Ltd auditors access audit information from the
NMS via audit records sent through to Tivoli and extracted audit logs.

running and the configuration be independently validated and also authorised by a
senior FSCS network person before use.

users must still be individually authenticated. (This implies that at the end of the
shift, the existing user must log out and the new user log on.)

not via Open View, and therefore not subject to its controls. This is confined to
authorised FSCS Network Managers using Telnet access to routers from a specific
dedicated NT system on the Operational Bridge area of the Network Centres.

permit Cisco access only when Cisco support is needed. A different TACACS
username and password must be used on each occasion, valid for the particular
session only.

routers. Only named and authorised senior CISCO staff may have the “enable”
mode needed for reviewing configuration files and debugging. CISCO staff
should not make changes to the routers, but advice the Network Manager of any
changes required.

6-101.85.10.1.8 The only direct access permitted to routers is for engineers
investigating hardware problems. In this case, access should always be done
locally at the router using a console.

10.1.9 ___In normal running, the routers must not have consoles attached, though
console access may be enabled. Any attempt to log-on at a console should be via
TACACS+, so flagged at the NMS.

6-40-4405.10.1.10 A faulty router must be configured out of the network before a console
is attached and the router engineer logs on to diagnose and repair the fault. When
the router is connected back into the system, its configuration must be checked
and the new configuration authorised before the router is configured for normal
use in the operational system.

6404445.10.1.11 Engineers are not individually known to the routers, so manual
procedures must identify the engineer when he visits the site before he is given
today’s password. The password used for direct router console access should be
changed via the NMS every 28 days and also immediately when an engineer
requires access.

10.2 Firewall Management

Firewalls are managed using Enterprise Centres on Solaris systems (shared with Security
token management), one at each Data Centre.

Enterprise Centre roles supported are Firewall Manager and Firewall Monitor. There are no
on-line support roles for the Enterprise Centre application or the firewall application.

640.245.10.2.1 All access to the firewalls must be via the Enterprise Centre, except for
hardware maintenance, As for routers, in normal running, firewalls must not have
consoles attached — they should only be attached for hardware maintenance after
the firewalls has been configured out of the system.

6.10.2.25.10.2.2__All configuration changes must be made via the Enterprise Centre and
logged via Tivoli. Firewall audit logs should also be sent to the Enterprise Centre.

610.2.35.10.2.3 __ Firewalls should restrict traffic as in the network access policies in 3.7.
(This is different for different firewalls).

6A45.11 Software Distribution Servers

Software distribution servers include the Configuration Management and associated signing
servers on Fujitsu Services (Pathway) Ltd project Outlets and the depot/Tivoli servers at the
Data Centres to which software is sent for onward transmission to other Fujitsu Services
(Pathway) Ltd systems at the Data Centres, Post Office outlets and elsewhere.

GA4LASI11.1 The Configuration management system should have access controls,
which conform to this policy, even though it is not at the data centre, or on a
separate secure LAN.

6A4A25.11.1.2 The associated signing server should be on the secure LAN, and
controls should be fully conformant with this policy.

6425.12 Implementation Servers at the Data Centres

Implementation of new Post Office outlets, including migration of in-office data involves
several servers at the Data Centres. The Post Office counters are delivered with a standard
configuration, which needs to be personalised and updated when installed.

The servers involved in this process are shown in the following diagram.
