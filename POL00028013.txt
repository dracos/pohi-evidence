To address governance findings
‘outlined in the interim report a new
governance structure has been
developed for Horizon processes

The governance framework for Horizon
processes is based on 3 ‘pillars’ used
by other organisations utilising
product/service management approach
‘and has been tailored to POL context
‘and Horizon challenges

- Strategy/Demand

Architecture

- Service Delivery

Each pillar requires a governance
forum chaired by the head of each area

Management

Single Product Ownership & Accountability

All capabilities required to develop, maintain or service Horizon are grouped in one team focused on delivering
‘outcomes and value for the Postmaster. A Product Manager is the technical point of contact for the Postmasters
and the Post Office Business and is accountable for the success of Horizon over its entire life-cycle.

Clearer accountability for Horizon su

Customer-contric thinking and stronger Postmaster voice in IT and th
understanding of Postmasters needs and more action in the interest:

Improved response to Postmaster demand, change and fix v
Postmasters and the Post Office business

Single accountability for better prioritisation betw

:t roadmap for stronger alignment of product with Postmaster future needs

Improved innovation over the whole lifespan of the product,

Improved user journey and Postmaster experience

Prior to Horizon Product Management

Lack of end-to-end ownership and accountability meant:

Product decisions being made without sufficient guidance and oversight
Postmaster Horizon requests passed from team to team resulting in longer issue resolution times or unresolved issues
Increased internal interactions and effort needed to address Horizon support, changes and fixes
Limited product improvement planning or innovation due to a lack of end-to-end ownership of all of the components that make

up Horizon
With Horizon Product Management
Clearer accountability for Horizon success

Customer-centric thinking and stronger Postmaster voice in IT and the business leading to better understanding of

Postmasters needs and more action in the interests of Postmasters
Improved response to Postmaster demand, change and fix via a single point of contact for Postmasters and the Post Office

business

Single accountability for better prioritisation between issues, changes and fixes
Product roadmap for stronger alignment of product with Postmaster future needs
Improved innovation over the whole lifespan of the product

Future Plans

G The Horizon system has grown over 25 years and encompasses a broad swathe of processes from
customer sales journeys in: counter banking, mails, travel, bill payment, identity services, etc to
branch processes such as: training, knowledge, stock management, cash management, and
branch accounting.

Ohi Our research indicates that there is no one system that we can buy that will do it all without

procure several components of the new platform as we continue to more complex use cases.

We will replace Horizon by 2025 with a new, modern IT system

We will start replacing
Horizon in 2023 with a
modern system, which we
will design and build with
Postmasters, for
Postmasters

»

The new system is starting to be designed now. It will take time to make
sure it is a solution that will serve Postmaster needs for years to come

We already know that it will be...

It will be fast and intuitive to use, with fewer, clearer
steps to complete transactions and faster, more
accessible training than the current system

It will support simpler, more streamlined in-branch
processes, with better safeguards, checks and easier
error-correction

It will be more flexible for Postmasters to use and for
the Post Office to make updates without disruption to
Postmasters and their staff

The new system will
start to become
available to branches,
ultimately replacing the

We will run pilots in branches

Of course, this means we will have

+ We don't want to overwhelm these sessions with one topic, so as
