Subject: RE: SoS sign off - POL STIP 2022/23
Attachment: BEIS approval request 2022 Incentive plans v13 LH final clean.docx
Dear both,

The timelines for managing the communication of Nick’s STIP for FY22/23 and his pay increase are
still causing significant issues for the motivation and retention of Nick.

Today, Nick requested an urgent meeting with Henry and I, where he was clearly distressed, highly
frustrated and expressed his deep concerns about the timelines and process for his STIP confirmation
for FY22/23 and his pay increase. He is emphatic he wants this shorting before the end of this month,
is feeling totally undervalued and is threatening to put a grievance in (again).

As you know, this has been going on since January. We sent the note from Lisa Harrington on 15"
February requesting his bonus plan (which is in his contract) to be approved (see letter attached).

We have not heard anything back from you on this.

Can I ask that you expedite the approval process for the STIP Plan for FY22/23 (so we can confirm his
participation) as well approve his annual pay increase of 5% effective 1* April 22.

All of these delays are eroding trust and Henry and I are very concerned about the negative PR this
will have, if Nick follows through on his threats of raising a grievance, which in my experience typically
results in a breakdown of trust and confidence, and results in a exit from the business. This could be
a PR disaster considering everything POL is working through.

I look forward to hearing from you urgently on this matter.

Kind regards,

Jane

Dear lan I just left you voicemail — I’m still waiting for a decision between DBT and UKGI after which it
can go up to the Secretary of State/ Minister Hollingrake — but waiting for UKGI/ DBT to agree the
position at the moment.

Kind regards

Hi Roshana

I wasn’t aware this was being held up. This is really disappointing to hear, given that the letter was
sent by Lisa over a month ago, and we are delaying communicating the STIP to the wider population
until it has been agreed for Nick and Al. We were at least hoping to communicate it before the end of
the year.

When are you expecting the decision on Nick’s increase to be made? When would you expect a
decision from SoS to be after that?

Thanks

Dear lan, I think we flagged this at the last catch up as we had to put this on hold pending the CEO
Pay increase approval — as the numbers had changed. We’re still waiting for a internal decision here
before putting up that submission but then would put up the STIP 22/23 — I appreciate this isn’t ideal
—we might be able to put the STIP 22/23 up but would need to say it’s dependent on the CEO
increase approval.
