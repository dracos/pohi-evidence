INTRODUCTION
1. The suspect should be informed that the interview is being tape
recorded.
2. The lights on the recording machine which indicate that the recording
equipment is activated and recording should be explained to the suspect.
3. Then state the date, time and place of the interview. The

Investigators should state their names and role and all other persons
present should identify themselves.

OBJECTION TO TAPE RECORDING If a suspect objects tell them that you will be
free to make a note of the interview anyway but the recording will provide a
clear and undisputed account of what takes place. If the objections
continue the suspect should be told that your instructions require that they
should record their objections on tape. After they have stated their
objection, or made no reply, decide if you are going to continue on tape or
revert to notes of interview.

PROCEDURE TO FOLLOW WHEN AN APPROPRIATE ADULT IS PRESENT Confirm they have
received a copy of the GSO01A. “You are not expected to act simply as an
observer. The purpose of your presence is firstly, to advise the person
being questioned, secondly to observe whether or not the interview is being
conducted properly and fairly, and thirdly to facilitate communication with
the person being interviewed.”

THE JUVENILE SHOULD BE ADVISED “The duties of the appropriate adult include
giving you advice and assistance. Also you can consult privately with your
appropriate adult at any time.”

REASONS The suspect should be told in detail the following;

1. Reason for the Investigation (The offences and matter under
Investigation) .
2. Reason why they have been Identified (Their suspected involvement, e.g.

DCDO. Be aware of the potential risk of jeopardising the enquiry by revealing
too much information prematurely) .

3. Reason for the interview (To establish the facts or seek an explanation
from them)

The suspect must be under no misapprehension that they are facing a criminal

investigation because the Investigators suspect that they have committed a

criminal offence.

NOTICE AT END OF INTERVIEW Inform the suspect that at the end of the
interview they will be given a notice explaining what will happen to the
tapes.

CAUTION “You do not have to say anything, but it may harm your defence if
you do not mention when questioned something which you later rely on in
court. Anything you do say may be given in evidence. Do you understand?”

EXPLANATION OF CAUTION IF REQUIRED

1. You do not have to say anything; you do not have to answer my
questions.
2. However if this matter goes to court and you give an explanation which

you have not told me about today the court may wonder why you are saying
it then. They may think you needed time to think up an explanation, they
may in fact think you are lying. So if you have an explanation now is your
opportunity to give it.

3. Anything you do say is being recorded and the tapes could be played in
court.
