Second Sight have asked for the issue of the provision of Prosecution Documents to them by POL to go
on the agenda for tomorrow’s Working Group (starting at 10 am). Given the lengthy exchanges in the
Select Committee we wanted to clear our lines with you.

Second Sight continue to press for access to all prosecution documents, including legally privileged
information and relating to cases where the Working Group has considered the case (and consequently
completed its work).

Our proposed line to take is (said in the nicest possible way):

<!--[if !supportLists]--><![endif]-->Post Office continues to provide publicly available documents
relating to prosecutions along with other documents that may be relevant to Second Sight for
cases that remain in the Scheme, as agreed by the Working Group.

<!--[if !supportLists]--><![endif]-->/t is not clear why Second Sight continue to ask for documents
relating to cases where the final CRR has been completed and considered by the Working Group
— the work of Second Sight and the Working Group is complete at that point.

<!--[if !supportLists]--><![endif]-->As previously discussed — and endorsed by the Chair — Second
Sight are not entitled to see legally privileged material.

<!--[if !supportLists]--><![endif]-->Post Office will not release it without a very clear rationale for
doing so, so please set that out in writing for us to consider.

Since the Select Committee, Second Sight have been increasingly bold in their assertions within Case
Reviews relating to Post Office’s approach to prosecutions. Only if very heavily pressed would we wish
to go further in saying (again, as nicely as possible):

<!--[if !supportLists]--><![endif]-->We do not see how this information would assist your review
of individual cases.

<!--[if !supportLists]--><![endif]-->Post Office’s approach to prosecutions is out of scope of the
Scheme.

<!--[if !supportLists]--><![endif]-->We note that in recent CRRs, Second Sight have made a
number of comments relating to prosecutions that they are not qualified nor competent to
make.

e  <!--[if !supportLists]--><![endif]-->We are not prepared to share legally privileged information at
a time when JFSA have instructed a legal firm in preparation of action against the Post Office.

Ona related note, we may also get pressed on the provision of emails from staff based in Bracknell. This
also came up at the Select Committee and we would propose to take the following line:

e  <!--[if !supportLists]--><![endif]-->We continue to work with colleagues to access the email files
requested — however, this is a very big job

e = <!--[if !supportLists]--><![endif]-->We remain unclear as to the question that Second Sight are
seeking to address

e  <!--[if !supportLists]--><![endif]-->/f greater clarity could be provided on that issue we may be
able to address their question more quickly

These were the issues that Chris was calling about earlier. If you are content with the lines we propose
an “ok” by email will be fine. Alternatively we are available to speak if that would be more helpful.

Thanks

Tom
