All,

Further to my email on Friday, please find attached Tony’s decision and casting votes on the mediation issues.
Tony will now revisit his vote in M054. Should POL wish to make a submission about the application of the new
test to M054, it should be with Tony by Thursday 28 August (copied to JFSA) and any reply to the POL submission
from JFSA should be with Tony by Monday 1 September.

Best wishes
