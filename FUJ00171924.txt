Problem Statement ( Underlying cause of the problem):
need to inform the clerk at the 2nd counter that the cheque rem out has already happened. and reversal
needs to be done.

Risk of not fixing:
minimal risk, very unlikely to happen because the clerk should physically have the cheque at the time of
processing, and then dispatch it, so it should not be available for concurrent processing.

The benefit of fixing:

risk of concurrent Cheque rem outs is no longer a problem. (BRDB_RX_REP_SESSION_DATA would
show two product 2 transactions for the same amounts in transaction mode if concurrent rem out has
happened.)

ASM Utilization Capacity (estimated man-days required to deliver the fix):
3 days

[Start of Responsel
consider the following scenario:

H) Counter 1 is logged in and attached to a shared stock unit

2) Press Back Office, Cheques

3) Print, or Preview and press Enter

l4) The Print, Preview and Rem Out & Cut Off screen is redisplayed

5) Switch to counter 2 which is logged in and attached to the same shared stock unit
6) Press Back Office, Cheques

7) Print, or Preview and Enter

Is) The Print, Preview and Rem Out & Cut Off screen is redisplayed

Is) Press Rem Out & Cut Off

ho) Press Yes to confirm Rem Out and Cut Off

hi) The remittance out slip is printed, followed by the daily cheques listing

H2) Press Continue on the confirmation message.

h3) Return to counter 1

Ha) Press Rem Out & Cut Off

5) Press Yes to confirm Rem Out and Cut Off

Hé) The remittance out slip is printed, followed by the daily cheques listing

7) MSGO0524 "Already Cut Off" is display because the report has already been cut-off.

lunfortunately, the cheques have been remmed out twice at this point. The second rem out will still be visible and not cut-off on
the cheques listing report if is produced again. The clerk would need to reverse the second rem out, otherwise they would be
financially down.

ffhis should be very unlikely to happen because the clerk should phyiscally have the cheque at the time of processing, and then

dispatch it, so it should not be available for concurrent processing. The clerks should be alerted to the problem by the message
SG00524 stating that the cheques list report has already been cut off.

IBRDB_RX_REP_ SESSION PATA would show two product 2 transactions for the same amounts in transaction mode 12 on different nodes for
the Same stock unit within 1 hour and 15 minutes of each other, but this could be a valid coincidence and does not mean the
oblem has definately occurred.

[the window for error could be reduced by checking when "Rem Out & Cut Off" is pressed that the cut-off marker for the cheques
listing report has not changed - i.e. before doing the rem out, but this would not stop two rem outs happening genuinely
concurrently.

fo truly fix this, there would need to be a new BAL service that performed both the rem out and cut off, which is a complete re-
rite of the application and a major amount of effort for very little business benefit.

Perhaps the best solution would be to change the message output, instead of MSG00524, to a message advising the clerk that a
concurrent rem out has occurred, and that they need to reverse the second rem out using existing reversals.

[fhe counter code would need a new overloaded copy of method CutOffReport in CutOffReportingBLO to take the message id to display
if the report was found to already be cut-off.

I am awaiting for POL confirmation of this solution.
