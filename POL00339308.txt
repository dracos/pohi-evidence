Hello Alwen. I've as yet had no confirmation from Janet that this meeting is still on. Do you have her telephone
number so I can call her to firm this up? Thanks. Ron.

Hi Alwen. I had a call about 20 minutes ago from Janet. She is setting up a meeting for 10:30 am
next Weds July 4th at Westminster. Ian and I are to attend, as maybe also is Andrew Bridgen
MP. I relayed to Janet that we have been instructed to hold back from doing major work on the
matter until after that meeting. Doubtless she will pass that on to Mr Arbuthnot and perhaps also
to Mr Bridgen.

Best regards. Ron.

Best regards. Ron.

Thanks Alwen. Susan and I spoke briefly earlier this evening and we agreed that
Jan and I should hold off until we have secured Mr Arbuthnot's endorsement. We
will, however, have a conference call tomorrow with Simon Baker and Rod Ismay
as we try to understand better the Helpdesk processes in responding to incoming
reports of mysterious shortages... and to determine what data/records they retain.

Best regards. Ron.

Ron os
I have spoken to; GRO JA's PA and she suggested that I let her
have your telephoni ‘and she will organise the meeting,
hopefully this week, so I will pass on your contact numbers.

If Susan suggested you start the work before meeting JA then I think
that's fine, but he will need to give his support before you officially start
‘on the reviews.

Thanks

Hi Alwen. Jorja and I spoke late this afternoon. I'm holding off
from doing more work on this matter until My colleague Ian
Henderson and i have been approved by Mr A. That somewhat
conflicts with my instructions from Susan which was to try to
progress the matter while she is away in hols. It'd be nice if Mr A
would like a meeting this Wednesday which is the best day for me.
I'm on
Very best regards. Ron.
