Dear Sirs
REGINA v JOSEPHINE HAMILTON

WINCHESTER CROWN COURT
PLEA AND CASE MANAGEMENT HEARING ~ 12™ MARCH 2007

I am required to disclose to you any prosecution material which has not previously been
disclosed and which might reasonably be considered capable of undermining the
Prosecution case against the accused or of assisting the case for the accused.

At this stage there is no prosecution material which meets the above test.

Attached to this letter is a copy of a Schedule of Non-Sensitive Unused Material.

If you supply a written Defence Statement to me the material will be further reviewed in
the light of that statement.

Yours faithfully

JA McFarlane
