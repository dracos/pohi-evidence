Please see request below — could we please prepare a shortish timetable that sets out the dates, issues, and inter-
dependencies?

thanks

Jane

It would be helpful to understand the timetable for appealing and what impact the recusal application might
have on that. I think you indicated that the Judge was willing to be flexible on the time limits for seeking
permission to appeal and presumably POL are developing their strategy for an appeal.

Kind regards
