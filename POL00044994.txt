Subject: Sentencing of Seema Misra - West Byfleet Post Office
Attachments: image003.wmz

Mrs Misra was sentenced today following last months trial at Guildford Crown Court where she was found
guilty despite trying to run a defence that Horizon was responsible for the losses

She was sentenced to 15 months imprisonment with no order for costs. A section 18 statement was served

and a timetable for confiscation has been agreed as Post Office® Financial Investigators will now attempt to
try and recover the monies stolen.

Thank you to everybody who assisted in this case.
