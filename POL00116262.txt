> Hi Mark, building on our conversation this afternoon (thanks for being available at short notice) re comms on the prosecutions
policy, which was very helpful: we have just finished the ARC and the same point was made by Alice re the comms sensitivities, ie.,
avoiding the conflation of various unrelated events, not proactively communicating any adjustments - online or otherwise, but
equally thinking how we manage the public messaging of option B, if it does become necessary. (She pointed out that it may emerge
at the JA/MPs meeting, which I think is a helpful angle to bear in mind as we shape it.)

>

> I imagine Chris will want to update his paper before the next Board (where he can - we are aware of constraints), so there is an
opportunity to feed in the comms messaging: indeed, if you can spare the time it might be worth you coming along if the paper is
tabled for discussion. If not, I will bring you in anyway as we prep for the MPs meeting.

> Can you meet with Chris and Belinda and shape an approach and a set of Q&As to inform the Board discussion, plus the same for
the MPs meeting - they won't be far different! Then you might want to run past Alwen and/or Martin for a second round check.

> Any questions, don't hesitate to get back to me or Chris.

B.
