Dear all

Further to the updates Chris and I have been providing about Second Sight's "Part Two" report, we have now issued our
detailed response to the Report to the recipients of Part Two report.

Our working assumption is that as Second Sight’s report was passed to the media, ours will be too. As before, we are
well prepared for this eventuality and plan to take the same position as last time. That is that passing confidential
documents prepared for the purpose of mediation is highly regrettable and not in interests of applicants.

As before, we will try to make no further comment and if pushed will keep our comments to a minimum. It is essential
we hold on that position to avoid giving the story unnecessary oxygen. The media outlets that ran the story last time
may pick up on this again.

I will monitor the situation closely and update you if the position changes.

Best wishes
Mark
