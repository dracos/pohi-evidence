1. Introduction

This document defines the processes applicable to the Peritas activities undertaken to
discharge the contractual responsibilities for measurement of the effectiveness of the user
training programme in a manner consistent with the Kirkpatrick model.

2. Scope

This paper is intended to provide a definition of the evaluation process required to
satisfy Requirement 915, Evaluation of User Training.

Although User Awareness programmes will have an appraisal process, this is outside the
scope of this paper.

3. Principles of Training Evaluation

3.1 Introduction

Training evaluation is an essential process in developing and delivering effective
training programmes. It is vital that effective evaluation is built into the development
as well as the delivery stages of training projects, so that milestones are set and
achieved. In this way, the training products are assessed throughout their lifecycle
against a known set of criteria, based upon the goals of the programme itself. Should
these change, the products can change as well. Thus, the evaluation process becomes
the controlling element that ensures the products finally delivered into the training
cycle meet all the needs and goals set for them.

It is clear that evaluation must follow a systematic approach which is commonly
understood so that it encourages a partnership between the training function and the
managers and staff to be developed. The advantage of obtaining commitment from the
management at the start of the programme is that the overall needs are clearly
identified and joint ownership of the solution exists.

Within the framework of such a partnership it is possible to document an evaluation
strategy. This strategy enables the development of tactics and measurements by which
to judge the effectiveness of the training itself.

3.2 The Four Level Approach to Evaluation

To ensure that the training delivered is effective, both Peritas and POCL apply a Four
Level Approach based closely on the well-known Kirkpatrick Model. Levels One to
Three are those most commonly used; Level Four, which complements the
methodology, is used less often.

The first three levels of the approach can be encapsulated within these questions:
Level One— Reaction

“Were the participants pleased with the training?”

“Did it meet their expectations?”
Level Two — Learning

“What did the participants learn?”
Level Three — Application

“Were the participants able to apply what they learnt during training in the work
place?”

One can see from the questions that levels 1 & 2 may be measured.

3.2.1 Level 1

Level One looks at the reaction of the participants and what they thought of the
training. This includes tutors, materials, facilities, methodology, content and similar
factors. Initial receptivity provides a good atmosphere for learning, but does not mean
high levels of learning will automatically occur.

3.2.2 Level 2

Level Two concems learning or knowledge gain. It measures the retention of

principles, facts, techniques and skills presented in the training. The measures must
be objective and quantifiable to be good indicators of what knowledge has been learnt.

3.2.3 Level 3

Level Three concerns measurement of the extent of application of knowledge. This
level is progressively harder to measure than the previous levels as there are many
factors which can affect on-the-job performance. Techniques include before and after
comparisons, observations by superiors and subordinates, statistical comparisons and
long range follow-ups.

3.2.4 Level Four Evaluation

Level Four evaluation attempts to measure the impact of training on overall business
performance. Typical success measures are reduced costs or increased output. This
would mean objective collection of detailed data before and after training to provide
benchmarks against which to analyse the changes. Many other variables exist which
can affect results, so attempts are made to isolate these.

Level Four evaluation is extremely complex and very difficult to measure in practical
terms, due to the many variables which can affect the enterprise during the period in
which a learning programme is being evaluated.

4. Contractual Obligations

4.1 Venue Assessment

Peritas are required to obtain an assessment of whether each venue used for user
training is satisfactory for that purpose. ICL Pathway have a contractual threshold
level which requires 85% of all events to be delivered within a satisfactory venue.
(See Appendix Al)

4.2 Training Assessment

Peritas are required to provide a procedure for measuring the effectiveness of the
training programme at levels 1 and 2 of the Kirkpatrick model. Both these measures

are to be taken when the delegate attends any user training event. Level 1 assessment
occurring when the training phase of the event is completed, subsequently a
competence test is used to secure the level 2 evaluation. (See Appendix A2)

The higher levels of the model, i.e. levels 3 and 4 are addressed by the “Management
of Change” programmes undertaken by ICL Pathway and POCL.

-5. Proposed Procedure

5.1 Timing of Measurement

On completion of each training event each delegate is required to provide an
assessment of the event in a manner consistent with level 1 of the Kirkpatrick model.
Such a process is consistent with the traditional end of course appraisal process used
in most commercial training events.

Following the course appraisal and review, each delegate is required to demonstrate
operational competence in a manner consistent with level 2 of the Kirkpatrick model.
Such a procedure requires the individual to complete a number of operational
processes both accurately and within agreed time constraints.

5.2 Course Appraisal

A course appraisal form will be the basis of the level one assessment and also the
venue assessment.

The appraisal form is completed by the trainee, subsequently the trainer’s comment
code is added to the document.

The form is a two sided document, side 1 is entered into the Peritas system (TPAS).
Should further analysis be required the reverse side of the form is used to capture the
detailed comments of each trainee.

5.3 Venue Assessment

Section 1 of the end of course appraisal will contain the venue assessment, the
delegate being requested to tick one of three statements which best describes the

contribution of the venue to the overall quality of the training event (See Appendix
Al). The three descriptions proposed are:

1, The venue helped the learning process.
2. The venue made no difference to the ability to leam.
3. The venue made learning more difficult.

The training administration system is used to record the comments and aggregate the
number of satisfactory responses i.e. the summation of questions 1 and 2, and the
number of unsatisfactory responses, i.e. question 3, selected.

The venue assessment is complemented by the trainer’s perception of the individual
attributes of the venue,

The attributes assessed are:

5.4 Level 1 Assessment

On completion of each training event each delegate is required to provide an
assessment of the event in a manner consistent with level 1 of the Kirkpatrick model.
Such a process is consistent with the traditional end of course appraisal process used
in most commercial training events.

Following the course appraisal and review, each delegate is required to demonstrate
operational competence in a manner consistent with level 2 of the Kirkpatrick model.
Such a procedure requires the individual to complete a number of operational
processes both accurately and within agree time constraints.

The appraisal requests the delegate to comment on the 5 key attributes of the training
event which are:

1, Achievement of course objectives,
2. Quality of course presentation.

3. Skill and knowledge of trainer.

4. Relevance of the course workbook.

5. Overall level of satisfaction.

The contractual requirement is based on a target percentage of the delegates regarding
the event as “satisfactory”, Rather than rely on secondary translation to determine
whether the event is satisfactory the contractual term is used within the appraisal.

For each attribute there are 4 possible ratings:

1, Excellent

2. Good

3. Satisfactory
4. Unsatisfactory

The rationale which results in the additional positive rating in this case “Excellent”
arises from the findings of the majority of research studies in that delegates have a
basic aversion to marking the highest positive category and therefore the need for
balance is achieved by inclusion of the extra category.

The subsequent processing of the appraisal form within TPAS, the training project
administration system, determines the “predominant perception” of each delegate as
follows:

The categories 1 to 4 are assigned a score in the range from 4 to 1 respectively, this
creates a maximum score of 20 for each delegate.

The “predominant perception” is calculated as follows:

Score <8 the course classification is unsatisfactory

Date:
7<score <13 the course classification is satisfactory
12 <score <18 the course classification is good
17< score <21 the course classification is excellent

The system aggregates the total number of each category in order to determine
performance against the contractual target on a cumulative and period basis, the
period being a calendar month.

The above banding ensures that the course is only considered as acceptable if the
majority of attributes are scored as satisfactory or better.

On the reverse side of the appraisal form detailed comments may be added concerning
the specific attributes of the event as measured on Page 1 of the appraisal form. In
addition, examples of the course appraisal are shown in Appendix A.

5.5 Level 2 Assessment

5.5.1 Measurement method

This assessment is based on a test of user competence which occurs on completion of
the training event (See Appendix B). The competence test content and critical
elements are based on the key competencies defined for each job category by POCL.
The categories identified are:

Trainer
Auditor
Postmaster

Counter Assistant

The successful completion of the competence test results in the award of a “Horizon
Achievement Certificate” for the appropriate job category as listed above (See
Appendix C). In the event of failure the trainee is invited to attend a remedial training
event.

6. Remedial Training

6.1 Criteria for live operation

All training for essential staff must be completed with not more than four working
days remaining prior to the installation date for the office.

Additional staff, above the level of Minimum Training Compliance (MTC), are
targeted for training within the same window. However, should they be unavailable
then they must be trained not more than two working days after the office installation
date.

6.2 Remedial Training Provision

Remedial Training is provided in two forms:-

1, Where a critical area of competence fails to meet the required standard the delegate
is invited to attend a remedial training event.

2. Where multiple areas of competency fail to meet the required standard the delegate
is invited to another training event.

Remedial events are provided during the afternoon or evening and are of 2.5 hours
tuition duration plus competence test re-sit.

The delegate will be offered a place on the first available local event, which will be on
the same day or the following day. Subject to the constraint that the remedial activity
must be completed prior to installation, then further alternative dates may be offered.

There are two variants of events ie. Manager’s remedial and Counter Assistant’s
remedial.

6.3.2 Scheduling

Manager’s remedial events are scheduled within each geographic area for the
Tuesday, Friday and Saturday (afternoon).

Counter Assistant’s events are scheduled within the same are for Monday, Wednesday
and Thursday of each week.

Typically, there will be up to 8 events on each day of the week covered by the
implementation programme.

6.3.3 Result notification

Competence test results for remedial events are known by 22.00 on any day. During
the period 22.00 to 23.00 the trainer will brief delegates on the outcome of their tests,
arrange any further remedial action should that be necessary and finally communicate
the results to the ICL Pathway Training Administration Centre (TAC).

The TAC processes the test results and transmits any changes to the status of the MTC
to the Roll Out Database (RoDB), in the event of a competence test failure which
relates to an office due for installation on the following working day, the information
is also transmitted by electronic mail to the appropriate implementation group
manager.
