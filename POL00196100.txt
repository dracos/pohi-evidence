Subject: Martin Griffiths/Sparrow

Angela, I wanted to ask the last couple of questions, copied to a different group.

This is such a tragic case and is likely to be much more complicated than it appears, or than Alan Bates had chosen to
see it initially. But because of Alan's reaction and of course the work we are doing with Sparrow, we should be completely
on the front foot - looking into it from a Sparrow angle immediately:

+ as this case was in the process post the Second Sight interim report, were we handling it any differently? And if so, are
there records to show what/how?

+ had Glenn Chester, John Breedon, auditors, security and finance colleagues and any others who were involved with
Martin or his case, received any briefings about approaching such cases differently than in the past? le., the cultural
change flagged by the Second Sight report? I know you have done some briefings but not sure how wide-spread.

+ Should my questions above prompt us to look at any others any differently? And to revisit colleague briefings?

+ I saw a note re letting James know, what about SS and Alan Bates?

Andy/Belinda, I will forward you the background.
Finally, I am happy to get answers to the above on Monday. It has been a very demanding week.
Thanks, Paula
