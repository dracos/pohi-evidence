Dear Emily,

I have been unsuccessful at locating the Agency File from our Leeds Office.

I was told by John Jenkinson at Leeds that the file had at one stage been booked out to [ think it was
Graham Ward, Investigations but had been returned . The file is somewhere at Leeds as it has not been

‘sent to Iron Mountain.

John can be contacted on Posilin

Regards,
