Report on practice events

4. Introduction:

ICL ‘Training Services were requested by Pathway/POCL 10 provide tainers for a
scries of courses for Counter Assistants and Counter Managers on the Horizon
system. The delegates on the courses were volunteers from POCL. The aims of these
practice courses from an ICL ‘Training Service perspective were as follows:

1. ‘To give experience to new trainers who had completed the ICL ‘Training Services
induction course in November/December 1998 and a recent Horizon update week-
end in delivering the Counter ‘Assistant and Counter Managers events.

2. To receive feed back from the delegates on the course content.

3. ‘Yo evaluate the Performance Standard Assessment (PSA) results.

4. To evaluate the equipment reliability when used in a training cnvironment.

Pathway/POC}. had agreed to use the courses as an opportunity for new trainers to
train in a real environment.

2. Outline:

The courses were delivered in a variety of Jocations within UK. The trainers were all
delivering the courses for the first time initially (with one exception) and were
working in pairs to miuximise benefit. The trainers who delivered the first courscs
were used again on subscquent courses as a second trainer this allowed a mix ofa
trainer who had delivered onc course and a trainer who was delivering for a first time.
The HISO development had an impact on the original plan for the allocation of
traincrs, as several of the trainers who were involved in the HFSO courscs were
withdrawn from this training.

Fairly confident.

Second day should be expanded to full day-especially for delegates who have no

Course well delivered yood idea to use two trainers.

Very enjoyable always afforded opportunity to ask questions.

Where do reports g0?

More time needed, setting up uscrs-allocating users.

Course definitely requires wo full days second day is six hours with no lunch break, J
fee] the course is unsatisfactory because it is very intensive and coverage of important
tasks i.c. balancing is rushed as a result. Bearing in mind a subpostmaster could be
asked to do their first balance unsupervised.

might find yourself in trouble. You need to know what you doing.

More time needed on the balancing, procedure. Sped through a lot of information and
the course quite intense.

Balancing (more time). .

Pretty confident with day to day work & procedures, stil] confused over the balance in
relation to comparing it with what T do at present.

Stil] a Jittle unsure in using system.

Found going through from Icon to Yoon a little daunting but I think with more hands
on 1 will become more confident.

Very interesting, quite intense, but very enjoyable have learnt lot.

A little longer necded on balancing procedures.

Reasonably confident, { am sure once ‘using equipment for real everything would
quickly become automatic.

A very good overview of the system and its functions.

Balancing section is a lot to take jn within the current format.

Canfident in day 1 content, less confident on the management / balancing section.

As somcone without counter knowledge Thave been picased at how casy the system is

to use.
The knowledge of the trainer was very good and his experience of post office life was
areal plus.

helped. Although I feel that % day for buluncing could be insufficient for offices that

Everyday transactions need muking a little more obvious, at the moment they are
rolled into one transaction which becomes u little overwhelming.

Reasonably confident as long as I take my time until 1 become more familiar.

One trainer Barry was excellent, the other Rob was satisfactory and I understand it
was only his second time. He was very nervous but did a reasonable job and I"m sure
he will be fine with more practice.

Quietly confident.

Confident.

Remarks general:

Bulancing (Two pers) (like to add).

Reasonably confident.

Could always have more time.

The system itself is no problem but finding some particular transactions scems
difficult.

The ‘dummy’ training aids do not always resemble the rcal thing.

Error adjustments (like to add).

Feel a bit mixed up with issuing PUNs / PANS etc.

The training is difficult to assess with the constant advances being made before going,
live. P'm sure this will be sorted out and in the main the course was very interesting.
Quite confident.

Fairly confident (Iwo pers).

Only satisfactory - because for my role as an auditor I needed to cover the balancing,
aspect of the system.

Stock and office balancing (like to add).

Trainer knew about Horizon but not enough of POCL transactions. No training given
on stock balancing etc.

4, Visitors:

There were u number of visitors to cvents, although it had been previously agreed on a
Pathway training mecting that no visitors would attend these events. As the cvents
were the trainers first 10 “rcal delegates” the added pressure of in some cases very
senior visitors to # trainer's first event made them somewhat apprehensive.

5. Course Delivery:

It is important that the course is delivered within the timings specified, timings are
_ difficult for a new trainer to judge with accuracy as the delegate groups differ from

event {o event in their aptitude for this type of system. Jt will take most trainers a
number of deliveries until they are confident and practiscd cnough to make the hest
use of time. The event can, and has been, delivered in the time-scales set.

From a trainer perspective this is not un easy course fora first delivery, as the trainer
has to be mobile throughout the event to fault check the delegates. This means that
trainers have to remember 12 hours of information in the right sequence and maintain
all the taining techniques required of a professional trainer. To practice ull the
trainers in the delivery of one event prior to rollout would take approximately 1 man-
year; trainers are assessed on clements of the courses as part of their induction.

None of the information taught on the Horizon courses is in itself considered
complicated, It is the volume of information delivered in the allocated time-scales,
which causes the delegates concer.

6. Unsatisfactory grading:

A small number of delegates graded clements of the event us “Unsatisfactory”, the
appraisals clearly stated on these occasions that the course delivery and trainer skills
were not # contributory factor to this grade. The delegates felt that the amount of
course content to be assimiluted was more than they could cope with. ‘They were
concerned that they would not be able to operate the system effectively afler
installation.

7. Trainer grading:

‘The uainers achieved no unsatisfactory grading from any of the delegates. A
significant number made additional favouruble comments on the truiner’s
performance. Only one delegate commented on the trainer's lack of Post Office
knowledge. While ICL ‘Iraining Services are satisfied with the trainers first attempt at
the events every effort will be made through the trainers Q&A process to raise the
standard of trainer’s performance even higher.

8. Streaming. of delegates for courses:

Ttis the authors understanding that delegates were to he streamed for events this was
not the case CA courses had delegates who were CM status and were disillusioned
because the cvent did not include office balancing. Some courses also contained
Jiaison staff for the project and one course two auditors. It is important that the course
content is publicised for delegates to ensure the right delegate is on the right level of
course.

9. Delegates requiring Additional Training

‘There were three delegates from all the courses who would have been required to

attend an Additional ‘lraining event after completion of the Performance Standard Oy
Assessment. 79 delegatcs attempted the PSA 3 required Additional Training this

equates to 2.37% of the total.

10. Performance Standard Assessment (PSA)

‘The PSA is currently under review two versions were used for the events and a third
modified version is awaiting formal sign off from POCL.

41. Conclusion:

‘Yhe trainer appraisals have been very favourable for a first attempt there is still room
for improvement particularly in the area of timings although the timings did improve
where a trainer delivered 4 subsequent event.

Jt would appear from some of the delegate appraisals that they expected balancing on
the Counter Assistants course.

The appraisals annotated “Unsatisfactory” on “overall level of satisfaction” was
because of the amount of information to be assimilated and the course content rather
than any problem with the trainer’s delivery.
