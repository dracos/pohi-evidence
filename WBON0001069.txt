Hi Pete

By way of an introduction, I am a colleague of Andy Parsons at Bond Dickinson.

With apologies for bringing this issue up again, we need to revisit the Known Error Log point and I'm currently looking
to draft a short description of what the KEL is / its scope etc. In addition to your helpful notes below, we wondered
whether you might be able to provide us with a few example KELs (5 or so), just from the top of the pile? Is this
feasible / easily done?

Thanks

We have checked all the KELs (takes time as they have free text included) and have found there are no KELs
that directly affect the normal operation of the Core Audit Process.

Thanks. Very useful.

Noted on the theme of questions — unfortunately these are not always under are control as these are questions being
put by Freeths, the postmasters' solicitors.

That said, are you 100% sure that there are no KELs in respect of the Core Audit Log? If so, we may say this to
Freeths so to try to avoid having to disclose the KELs.

Thanks

Andrew

As requested, please find below our answers to the 6 questions posed.

We would, however, like to first point out our concern regarding the underlying, erroneous, theme that these questions
(and the previous questions we've provided answers to you on) seem to be driving at. At the risk of sounding like a
“broken record”, the key premise of the HNG-X (and Horizon) system is the Core Audit Log. This comprises the only
source of the “truth”. And to our knowledge there has been no identified issues with the Core Audit Log and there are
no KELs in respect of this log. To this end, the questions regarding the existence or otherwise of issues with other
elements of the system are, in our opinion, a distraction to the key premise and could be used to create an erroneous
view of HNG-X / Horizon. It is our view that a strong rebuttal is required and a shift of focus from a view that we
should somehow constantly need to “prove the negative” to a focus on the fact that the Core Audit Log provides a true
source of the data entered and transactions performed at the relevant terminals. Any subsequent use of said data by
the system does not impact on this “truth” and as such we often determine the existence or otherwise of errors by
reference to the Core Audit Log.

The answers (highlighted in yellow) to your questions are:

What format do these logs take and where are they held? The logs (referred to as the Known Error Log or “KEL”) are

) What level of detail is included within the logs (i.e. are they generic logs for all Horizon errors or linked to specific
branches, do the logs explain the consequences of the error and the fix which was aI ?

/ When did Fujitsu begin to maintain these logs and are they still maintained? The log was implemented from day 1 of

WBD_000939.000012
Are the logs capable of being extracted and provided to us? Yes via excel data extract

WBONO001069
WBON0001069

Have Post Office previously been provided with a copy of these and, if so, to whom and when? We don't believe Post
Office has ever asked for this before but it is available if required.

Has there been any correspondence between Post Office and Fujitsu concerning these logs?

I suspect loads— but it

would be ce to just understand in e level terms how any are used. tne earnath ela hese

Hope this helps

Hope you're well. Would you mind hoping with what is hopefully a quick query?

The solicitors for the postmasters have asked us to provide them with a copy of the ‘known error logs' kept by Fujitsu
and all correspondence between Fujitsu and Post Office relating to the same. So we can respond to this request it
would be appreciated if you could confirm whether a Horizon "known error log" or a similar documents exist. We've not
decided yet on whether to provide this information (and so don't need any documents from you at this stage) — we're
just trying to scope out what might be covered by the request.

We would appreciate if you could help with the following:

What format do these logs take and where are they held?

What level of detail is included within the logs (i.e. are they generic logs for all Horizon errors or linked to specific
branches, do the logs explain the consequences of the error and the fix which was applied, etc)?

When did Fujitsu begin to maintain these logs and are they still maintained?

Are the logs capable of being extracted and provided to us?

Have Post Office previously been provided with a copy of these and, if so, to whom and when?

Has there been any correspondence between Post Office and Fujitsu concerning these logs? I suspect loads — but it
would be good to just understand in high level terms how they are used.

I'm hoping that this questions are fairly easy to address but if they do need more careful thought, please let me know
and we can discuss how to tackle them.

If possible, a response by close of business on Wednesday would be useful.

Kind regards

Andy
