Subject: RE: Draft Letter to Sir Anthony Hooper - SUBJECT TO PRIVILEGE

Thanks Tom, this is a good letter. I wonder whether we should, however, add in something to acknowledge what
Tony has suggested by way of mediation — that is we mediate on the narrow point of whether POL would support an
appeal. We have set out our position on this previously in the email from Rod to Tony.

Best wishes
Belinda

Subject: Draft Letter to Sir Anthony Hooper - SUBJECT TO PRIVILEGE

Mark Underwoodi=} Georgia Barker;

All

Earlier in the week Chris asked me to draft him a letter to Tony Hooper fulfilling the request to look again at Post
Office’s approach to mediating criminal cases. We had a draft from CK that contained some helpful material but tone
was not ideal (attached for ease).

Also attached is my lay person’s interpretation of the CK draft based on my conversation with Chris. It needs a proper
legal check plus any other comments you wish to make. My aim is to demonstrate that have genuinely looked at the
issue again and are being reasonable. We must also assume that this will find its way into the public domain as I
would expect Tony to want to share with the entire Working Group. We won’t persuade Tony our position is correct
but the “structured discussion” element shows some flexibility on our part and offers an incentive to endorsing the
wider proposal.

Andy —1’d be particularly grateful if you could consider potential examples to be inserted in here (please see my
comments)
Thanks

Tom
