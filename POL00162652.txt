Mark,

Yes I saw this when it came in. I've had someone to contact Amjed to see if we can get to the bottom of
this for him.

Good morning

Hope yous r well. When I took over my branch at Edinburgh rd 464 in September 2014 fad code
294832X

I have had problems with the ATM

Training was given but the lady that came out she didn't know much about the blue sheet ATM
balancing sheet.

So I was left on my own my sheet has never balanced except from last week where I got another
postmaster from the other side of the town to come and help me out.

This issue is that I have had some transactions corrections totally about £1900 to give but it's not
my fault.

Secondly the machine is off quit an age now which I strongly believe should be upgraded.

So why do postoffice Itd have people working for them that don't have a clue in training how can
they train others?

The lady that came to train me was a lady called Margaret Burke she was calling other colleagues
to ask them what to do on the blue sheet I said why don't u go and tell them to come as u don't

Please advise and help me

Good idea Amjed. I can assure you we try really hard to get our position across! But
we can't talk about individual cases publicly. This is the statement we issued after
Panorama.

I hope you have a good conversation with Angela. Don't hesitate to contact me if I
can help.

Best wishes

Hi Amjed

I think Angela is going to call you but just to reassure, the
BBC has not seen all the evidence in the cases it featured.
We don't have our own laws - we have to meet the very

high standards of the courts and we prosecute very rarely.

Best wishes

Yeah I understand what ur saying but if the
BBC r saying that innocent people r getting
prosecuted then that scares the living day lights
out of me.

They must have some evidence to broadcast
the programme?

Also the BBC said that the postoffice has there
own laws regarding punishment?

So many questions and uncertainty

Kind regards

Dear Amjed

Thank you for your email about
the BBC programme which was
broadcast on Monday night.

Tam really sorry that it concerned
you so much. I also understand
that. It painted a very worrying
picture.

IT would like to reassure you on a
few points.

Firstly, the programme was very
one-sided. I have been talking to
the programme with my team for
many months and we have
provided them with information
and evidence which disputes the
claims they made. Sadly these
were not reflected and we are
taking that up with the BBC.

Secondly, I can assure you that the
allegations made are untrue. The
Horizon system is efficient and
effective while the business takes
its approach to prosecutions
seriously: we do prosecute where
there is evidence of wrongdoing,
but we never prosecute anyone for
making innocent mistakes.

There is no evidence in the cases
featured on Panorama of issues in
the Horizon system being to blame
for losses in branch.

We cannot comment about
individual cases as you will
understand, but I hope this
reassures you.

My number is below: do call if I
can help further. I have also copied
my colleague Angela who I know
would also answer any concerns.

Best wishes and thank you for
raising your concerns.

Mark
