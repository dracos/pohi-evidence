‘Horizon - Termination

Thank you for copying to me the Solicitor General's advice. Although I do not agree
that the POCL approach is necessarily slower than the DSS approach I would hope that all are - ~
now agreed that itis safer. . ne

I do think that we should all aim to bring this legal debate to a close and I would nor
like to be responsible for prolonging it. That is why’ J do not propose to comment in detail on
the Solicitor General’s advice. However, there i is one aspect of his advice which J believe it is
crucial to clarify in the interests of both public sector parties.

It was generally agreed in conference that perhaps the worst of all worlds would be to

“ give a time of the essence notice which sets an unreasonable period and thereby enables
Pathway successfully to sue for anticipatory breach of contract. That would be an

unforgivable error. I therefore agree entirely with paragraph 16 of the Solicitor General's
advice.

. However, I think the reasoning in paragraph 17 is dangerously misconceived. It seems
to suggest that because the Authorities are entitled to terminate by giving twelve months

achieve-Operational Trial might be reasonable.

That is misconceived in two respects. First, the period of twelve months is a notice

complete Operational Trial. Secondly, termination for convenience requires twelve months
notice plus the payment of.a specified amount by way of compensation. Currently. the
relevant formula would require a payment to Pathway of an amount up to almost £400
million. The fact that the Authorities can terminate on twelve months notice if they pay
Pathway £400 million should not be used as an argument for saying that a period shorter than
what is ‘required is a reasonable period. .

In fact, 1 understand that the current date which both Pathway and the Authorities
think is the most likely date for completion of Operational Trial is 30th September, 1999.

The “POCL approach” (on current information) is therefore that a time of the-essence
notice expiring on 1st October, 1999 should be Served. For the avoidance of doubr, a decision
to serve a time of the essence notice with a shorter period would not represent the POCL
approach. ,

Ishould add chat it would be quite reasonable, in the circumstances, for ministers co
conclude that the time of the essence route is the most appropriate even if it is ministers’
unequivocal wish to terminate, That conclusion rests on an assessment of the likelihood of
Pathway failing to meet the deadline. Although-I quite understand that the Solicitor General
does not feel able to comment on this question, POCL believes it to be highly. unlikely that
Pathway will complete Operational Trial by that date if all currently proposed concessions are
withdrawn. In other words there i is every likelihood that the time of the essence notice will
lead to termination.

Please feel free to give this letter such further circulation as you consider necessary.

Yours sincerely, ‘ .

Horizon - Termination Options

Thank you ‘for your call this afternoon reporting on certain discussions at the working
group meeting. .

As you know, there are a number of different termination options. We believe the best
is likely to be to serve a time of the essence notice of a reasonable period. One particularly
bad option would be to give a time of the essence notice which was not reasonable because it ©
required operational trial to be completed in a time period which we all know is impossible,
or highly unlikely. Accordingly, serving a time of the essence notice expiring in July when we
all know that operational trial is highly unlikely to be completed before 30th September
would be an extraordinarily foolhardy thing to do (and would be contrary to the advice of
counsel to the Law Officers).

Indeed I would even prefer to pursue the somewhat discredited schedule CS route
rather than serve an invalid time of the essence notice.

What is more, given the view that it is unlikely that Pathway will continue working on
