Good chat with GC Jane

Think she begins to agree — Grab’

Issue I raised is inability to brief N QC in person and Judgment is also about what was NOT taken into account...and

that needs briefings. Briefing better done in person. She agreed.

She is interested in DP QC and if there is availability info pre 10am, all the better.

GC Jane speaking to one director (don’t know who) and expects to decide around 10am today as to who to go with for

view on recusal and then (as a separate work stream) "general contractual appeal"

Good convo’. I think she was OK with where we got to
