Dear Sir / Madam

With reference to the above, please find enclosed all the necessary documents in order
for me to apply for Postmaster at The Grange in Rayleigh, Essex —- FAD 1031406.

My apologies my application has taken a while to reach you in order for me to apply
for this post, however, due to personal circumstances I believe that there has been
communication between Mr Alan Lusher and my Mother (Sue Palmer), who is the
current owner of the business, and there is possibly a note to this affect on my file.

Please note that I am to go into partnership with my Mother on the retail side of the
business, however the position of Postmaster is for myself only and she will not be
working on this side of the business at all. I currently work in the Post Office full
time at the Grange under the current Postmaster William Wilcox. However I do
understand this does not guarantee me the position of Postmaster even though as I am
led to believe, this role is not open to any other candidates.

I enclose my business plan as requested and our accountant has drawn up the last
three years accounts plus the projected years forecast for 2008 which is also enclosed.

I very much look forward to hearing from y: d if you need any further information,
please do not hesitate to contact me on: _ __between 8.30 and 5.45pm or by
written communication using the address at the top of this page.

Dear Ms Prady

Please accept this letter as written confirmation, duly signed, as agreement that we are
to lend our Son £70,000 in order for him to buy his half of the family business in
order to apply for the position of Postmaster at The Grange. The money leant will be
used to acquire a 50% share of the retail side of the business on the pretence that he is
installed as Postmaster. Kevin will run the Post Office himself without our
involvement and the retail side will be joint responsibility. The loan terms and
conditions are agreed by all parties and we are happy to sign this letter to that affect.

Signed
