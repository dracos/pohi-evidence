                 SECOND WITNESS STATEMENT OF RUTH REID




1. I, Ruth Reid, will say as follows:

2. In recognition of the importance of the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry,

   continue to offer my full co-operation to the Inquiry.

   3. I am providing this statement following receipt of a second Rule 9 Request

      dated 30 November 2022 from the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry asking me to

      provide a written statement regarding issues falling within Phase 2 and Phase

      3 of the Inquiry. This Request contains 41 questions which the Inquiry have

      asked me to address in my statement. For ease of reference, I have written

      out each question with its corresponding question number.

PLEASE CONSIDER POL00083922 AND FUJ00000485.

Question 1: Please describe and explain how ICL Pathway proposed to rectify

Acceptance Incident 376 in early August 1999?

  4. FUJ00000485 is a Change Control Note ("CCN"). I understand this to be a

      contractual document between ICL Pathway Ltd ("Pathway") and Post Office

      Counters Ltd ("POOL"). I understand this CCN is the first of a number of

      CCNs. I have not seen this document before. I was not involved in agreeing

      contractual provisions. I believe this would have involved Dave Miller and

      Keith Baines rather than myself.

   5. POL00083922 contains a number of documents regarding a number of

      acceptance incidents. As I have explained in my first statement, my work was

      primarily focused on Acceptance Incident 376 ("Al 376"). This was a data

      integrity issue between the electronic summary cash account stream and the

      individual transactions which made up that cash account. Both streams of

      data were produced by Pathway. The error was identified when comparing

      these data streams with the information available to TIP (the Transaction

      Information Processing project). This was designed as a temporary check to

      ensure that TIP could receive a complete data set from Pathway.


                                   Page 2 of 21

                                                                                   WI TN05210200




  6. 1 consider that it was worth highlighting that there continued to be a separate

     supporting document stream produced by Transaction Process which fed the

     business ledgers and the end to end error resolution process.

  7. The document is produced by John Dicks of Pathway and confirms that the

     incident was witnessed by Martin Box of POOL_ The document confirms that

     POCL consider the severity to be high as it "would affect POCL's ability to

     produce an accurate cash account". The document goes on to confirm that

     Pathway "accept the problem exists" but "would argue about the severity". It

     goes on to confirm that Steve Warwick (of Pathway) was "to provide

     rectification of this issue. PWY understand the problem and are currently

     working on the fix".

  8. As I do not have an IT and accounting background and was not on the End to

     End Working Party focusing on this issue I cannot provide a technical answer

     to the question. What I can say is that, to the best of my recollection,

     Pathway proposed a change to the TIP interface to introduce the data integrity

     control which was a control between the two data streams_ To have that

     introduced on their side would have required cross party resolution as part of

     the business as usual end to end error resolution process, which was being

     worked up by the End to End Working Party.

Question 2: Please explain why you considered that acceptance should be

declined in August 1999?

  9. My recollection is that at this time the error rate was still 1.2%. Pathway

     themselves were not content with this error rate at this time and therefore it




                                    Page 3 of 21
                                                                                            W I TN05210200
                                                                                       WITNO5210200




      was agreed by everyone including myself that acceptance be declined in

      August 1999.

Question 3: What (if any) concerns did you have at this stage about ICL

Pathway's openness and willingness to share information and data concerning

the nature, severity and cause(s) of Acceptance Incident 376?

   10. Due to the passage of time is it difficult to recall how I felt in August 1999 but

      to the best of my recollection I do not recall having specific concerns at this

      time. Both parties accepted that the error rate was too high and Pathway had

      committed to continue work to reduce the error rate. Both parties committed

      to a series of workshops to work on this and a number of other issues. I was

      aware that there was a great deal of work to be done on both sides but there

      was nothing to cause me to have concern regarding Pathway's willingness

      and openness to share information and data.

PLEASE CONSIDER POL00038332, POL00043711, POL00028466,

FUJ00118144, FUJ00118146 AND FUJ00118147

Question 4: What did you understand the root (cause)s of the accounting

discrepancies revealed by Acceptance Incident 376 to be?

   11. Given that I do not have a technical / IT / accounting background I do not feel

      able to provide an answer. However, I would say that Al 376 was considered

      a data integrity issue rather than an accounting discrepancy.

Question 5: Did you consider that ICL Pathway had an adequate

understanding of the root cause(s) of the accounting discrepancies?

   12. 1 consider Pathway adequately understood this data integrity issue as it

      presented itself.

Question 6: How many outlets were affected by cash account discrepancies in

the summer of 1999?

   13. 1 don't know.

Question 7: Did the control which you proposed be introduced by ICL Pathway

address the underlying root cause(s) of the accounting discrepancies?

   14. My understanding is that the data integrity control was an enabler to identify

      the reason for errors between the two Pathway produced data streams and

      therefore would address the Al 376 data integrity issue.

   15. Following the introduction of Horizon, there was still the need for error

      resolution by the Transaction Processing Business Unit in Chesterfield and it

      was accepted that we still needed a process to manage accounting

      exceptions where transaction were not automated at the point of sale/data

      capture after the developers handed over the Horizon system.

Question 8: If not, what action did you understand ICL Pathway to be taking to

address the root cause(s) of the accounting discrepancies?

   16. Pathway were responsible for resolving the Al 376 data integrity issue as set

      out above. Pathway were not responsible for all POCL accounting

      discrepancies.

   17. In terms of the action Pathway were taking to address the data integrity issue

      at this time document POL00028332 sets out the work Pathway have done to

      identify the error and contributory problems and fixes developed and

                                                                                 WI TN05210200




      implemented as at 12th August 1999. Document POL00043711 contains the

      minutes of subsequent meetings on 25th and 26th August 1999 which again

      provide an account of the progress made and actions required. To the best of

      my recollection these documents accurately set out the action Pathway were

      taking.

Question 9: Did you consider that the action being taken by !CL Pathway to

investigate the underlying root cause(s) of the accounting discrepancies was

sufficient? Please explain the reason(s) for your answer.

   18. Yes, for the reasons set out above and having regard to the actions Pathway

      were taking as set out in the documents referred to.

PLEASE CONSIDER FUJ00079176 AND FUJO0118150

Question 10: Please describe and explain how the error rate of 0.6% came to

be proposed by you and Keith Baines as a condition for acceptance of the

Horizon system?

   19. There was an End to End Working Party which came up with the 0.6% error

      rate which came to be proposed by Keith Baines and I. This Working Party

      included Mark Burley who worked for me and various members of Keith

      Baines' team. For the avoidance of doubt, this working party was not confined

      to those with technical/IT backgrounds but also included Transaction

      Processing, Finance, the Operational Retail Network Management and the

      Investigation and Audit teams. I believe that the 0.6% error rate would have

      had to have been agreed by the Head of Transaction Processing, which was

      the relevant business unit. This position owned the operational business

      process, which was the relevant school of management thought at that time.

                                    Page 6of21

                                                                                     WI TN05210200




   20. 1 was the representative of these group at the Acceptance Workshops and

      therefore the conduit for feeding into Pathway, the findings of the End to End

      Working Party.

Question 11: Why did you consider such an error rate to be acceptable?

   21. 1 believe it would have been the position that if an error rate of 0.6% was

      acceptable to the Head of Transaction Processing Business Unit, the

      technical representatives of the relevant working group and Keith Baines (as

      POCL Commercial Lead), with the impact of accepting such an error rate

      having been assessed and costed, I considered it acceptable.

Question 12: What did you understand the impact of such an error rate to be

on the network of post office branches once the Horizon system had been

rolled out nationwide?

   22. As I mentioned above, agreeing an error rate of 0.6% would have been

      subject to an impact assessment which would have considered the cost and

      resource required to investigate and resolve the residual errors. There was a

      Business as Usual process for dealing with errors, which existed prior to

      Horizon because errors were a fact of life where transactions were not fully

      automated and required manual input of information at the outlet. That

      remained the position following the roll out of Horizon.

   23. There was a large number of people in the Transaction Processing Business

      Unit in Chesterfield whose role it was to investigate and resolve errors. As a

      result, I considered that the network of Post Office branches would have been

      supported by these business processes in managing any residual errors

      resulting from Al 376 data integrity issues.

                                                                                     WI TN05210200




   24. For the avoidance of doubt the End to End Working Party were responsible

      for augmenting the end to end business resolution process as a result of

      introducing both Horizon and the data integrity check.

Question 13: How did you envisage that POCL and ICL Pathway would manage

the resolution of errors at a rate of 0.6% nationwide?

   25. Following roll out the resolution of errors would have been the role of the

      Transaction Processing Unit in Chesterfield following the Business as Usual

      process with input, as required, from the Retail Network, Finance, Internal and

      External Audit and the Internal Investigation teams. At this time, there was a

      team of around 700 people in Chesterfield within Transaction Processing

      involved in this process.

Question 14: Please describe and explain the other conditions which you

proposed as part of the resolution of Al 376 prior to acceptance?

   26. 1 believe the question refers to the 6 conditions which are referred to at page 9

      of document FUJ00079176 as being proposed by Keith Baines and I. There

      is also a reference to a document called "RH's paper" on page 9 of that

      document. I have not seen that paper and I cannot recall from memory what

      the other conditions were. These conditions and the resultant papers, were

      produced by the End to End Working Party.

PLEASE CONSIDER POL00038907.

Question 15: Who was responsible for determining whether or not acceptance

of the Horizon system should take place in September 1999?

   27. To the best of my recollection this would have fallen to the Release

      Acceptance Board. I do not know if there was one individual who had ultimate

      responsibility. For the avoidance of doubt, I confirm that I was not a member

      of the Release Acceptance Board and responsibility did not sit with me.

Question 16: At paragraph 92 of your statement dated 13 October 2022, you

state that Peter Copping, an Independent Expert, recommended "as part of the

contract arbitration process, on the basis that there was a rectification plan to

introduce the data capture release in December 1999 (this was a large piece of

work), that acceptance take place but on a conditional basis, rather than

acceptance continue to be declined."

      a. Please confirm how and when this recommendation was

      communicated to you and! or to POCL.

   28. 1 do not specifically remember how it was officially communicated to POOL

      but from my perspective, my own knowledge of Peter Copping's

      recommendations came from the discussions which took place at the

      acceptance workshops at the Renaissance Hotel at Heathrow.

      b. Please confirm what (if any) discussions you held with other

      employees of POCL concerning this recommendation.

   29. 1 do not specifically remember but I would have discussed it with Dave Smith,

      who was my boss. I would be talking to him daily or several times a day and

      we would talk about everything all the time, before and after every meeting.

      He was based in Gavrelle House in London. I know I also spoke with Mark

      Burley and Peter Jones on a daily basis and it is very likely I would have

      therefore discussed it with them. The same can be said for the Automation

                                                                                  WI TN05210200




      Working Group which I was a member of— it is very likely that I would have

      discussed it with my colleagues on the AWG, in particular Sue Harding of

      Transaction Processing, Shaun Delaney of POL Finance and Carol Pryslak

      and one other person (I do not remember their name), who represented the

      Regions of the Operational Retail Network on the AWG. Dave Smith would

      have represented this type of issue at the Automation Programme Group

      level.

      c. Did you consider this to be a binding recommendation by the

      independent expert? Please explain the reason(s) for your answer.

   30. 1 do not know the contractual or legal status of Peter Copping's involvement

      and therefore I do not know whether his recommendations were binding.

Question 17: Why did you prefer for the data integrity control to be

implemented prior to acceptance?

   31. From a common sense viewpoint I thought it was better for Pathway to

      implement the control prior to formal acceptance rather than to rely on POCL

      through the TIP process and because the TIP checking process was not

      designed to be a permanent process. I wanted to see it fixed and the target

      end to end operational process in place before acceptance.

Question 18: What (if any) risks did you perceive there to be in granting

conditional acceptance to the system prior to implementation of the control?

   32. To the best of my recollection, conditional acceptance wasn't something I had

      considered and I didn't know it was possible. As far as I was aware, the

      concept of conditional acceptance was introduced/raised by Peter Copping

      and the respective commercial teams. Once I understood how conditional

                                                                                    W ITN05210200




      acceptance could work, and what the conditions could/would be, I was

      satisfied with the recommendation and did not perceive any particular risks on

      the basis that Pathway would still be required to demonstrate an improvement

      to the system to bring the error rate within acceptable limits in order for

      acceptance to take place.

Question 19: To whom (if anyone) did you communicate your preference and!

or concerns about the risks of granting conditional acceptance to the system?

   33.1 would have discussed it with my colleagues as outlined in my answer to

      questions 16b. above.

Question 20: To your knowledge, who ultimately took the final decision in

respect of acceptance of the Horizon system?

   34.Please see my response to question 15 above.

PLEASE CONSIDER FUJ00079316, FUJO0118143 AND FUJ00118194

Question 21: What (if any) involvement did you have in scrutinising the design

for the EPOSS / TIP Reconciliation Controls?

   35.The technical work of scrutinising the design for the EPOSS / TIP

      Reconciliation Controls would, to the best of my recollection, have been

      carried out by the End to End Working Party. I don't recall ever seeing any of

      the Pathway design documents. I do not know whether such document would

      have been shared with anyone on the POOL side involved in the technical

      work.

Question 22: What did you understand about how these controls were

intended to function?

                                     Page 11 of 21

   36. As I do not have a technical/IT/client accounting background this is not within

      my knowledge.

Question 23: Were you satisfied that these controls were sufficiently rigorous

to address the accounting integrity issues identified y Al 376? Please explain

the reason(s) for you answer.

   37. Again, I am unable to provide an answer from a technical/IT perspective. The

      implementation of data integrity controls was focused on ensuring that the

      error rate of the Al 376 data integrity issue was reduced to 0.6% or less,

      otherwise Core System Release would not take place.

Question 24: Who within POCL was responsible for investigating and

resolving the manual error reports produced by ICL Pathway pursuant to these

controls?

   38. The Transaction Processing Business Unit in the first instance. Depending on

      the nature of the issue there may have been a need for involvement from the

      Operational Retail Network Management, the Finance Executive, Pathway

      and the Investigations Department.

Question 25: How were accounting discrepancies caused by POCL Reference

data intended to be resolved?

   39. To the best of my recollection, this would have been the work of the

      Reference Data Project Team (Ted Baldwin and Geoff Darby) in conjunction

      with John Meagher of the Horizon Product Assurance Team. I was not part of

Question 26: Are these the types of daily and weekly reports to which you refer

in paragraph 112 of your witness statement dated 13 October 2022?

   40. No. For an example of the reports I was referring to see page 2 of document

      P0L00028559.

PLEASE CONSIDER POL00043723.

Question 27: At the time of the roll-out decision on or around 24 November

1999, what was your understanding of the following:

      a. The ability of the integrity control to detect all data errors;

   41. 1 can only rely on what is contained within document POL00043723 to assist

      me in providing an answer to this question. POCL's position was that the

      Pathway integrity control was capable of detecting all relevant incidents. This

      is not the same as having no errors but what was required, as the document

      confirmed, was a robust process for error detection of the two data streams.

      My recollection is that the error rate must have been reduced to 0.6% or

      under which was what had been previously required.

      b. The level of disruption and cause of new incidents;

   42. 1 am unable to recall and the documents I have reviewed do not assist me in

      providing an answer.

      c. POCL's understanding of the design and operation of the emerging

      reconciliation controls;

   43. 1 am unable to provide an answer regarding design as I do not have a

      technical/IT background. I understand the purpose/operation was to enable

      the data streams to be better compared and for errors to be identified and

                                                                                      WI TN05210200




      reported so that they could then be investigated by the Transaction

      Processing Business Unit.

      d. The constraints on the level of testing of the emerging reconciliation

      controls.

   44. To the best of my recollection, whilst there remained a lot of work to do on

      both sides, I believe that we were satisfied that there was sufficient time and

      resource to carry out testing of the emerging reconciliation controls. This

      factored in the operational impact of the Christmas period and an accounting

      period end.

Question 28: What (if any) input did you have in relation to the "Demand

Position Paper" produced in preparation for the checkpoint meeting in

November 1999?

   45. I don't recall having any input. The document is unhelpful as it does not

      contain details of author(s) and distribution. It also appears that the document

      is perhaps two versions of the same document or two separate documents,

      with pages 1-4 largely repeated on pages 5-8. I don't remember seeing it

      before.

Question 29: What action did you understand POCL to be taking to address

the ongoing concerns about cash account discrepancies in November 1999?

   46. The work of the End to End Working Party continued throughout this period.

      Due to the passage of time I cannot remember any specific details_

PLEASE CONSIDER FUJ00118186

Question 30: Why were certain types of cash account discrepancy excluded

from the agreed error rate criterion of 0.6% (as originally defined in the Second

Supplemental Agreement) in January 2000?

   47. 1 do not feel that I am in a position to comment on the content of the Second

      and Third Supplemental Agreement as these are contractual documents and

      was not involved in the drafting or negotiation of the contract between

      Pathway and POCL. I don't recall ever seeing these documents.

   48. FUJO0118186 is a document signed by Dave Miller in the presence of Keith

      Baines and dated 1      January 2000. As I explained in my first statement,

      don't recall being present in January 2000 and I often took an extended

      holiday in January.

   49. 1 believe the contract would have reflected the fact that the agreed error rate

      would only point to exceptions between the individual transactions stream and

      the cash count transaction stream as compiled by the Horizon system. There

      were many different causes of errors not all of which were attributable to

      Pathway, for example those attributable to human error at the point of input of

      information at an outlet. Many of our clients' transactions were not

      automated. Automated products were known within the business as `token

      drive' products. I believe that the contract would have recognised that

      Pathway weren't responsible for errors which derived from other legacy

      processes/systems/products which hadn't been fully automated/were not

      token driven and which required manual input.

Question 31: Please describe and explain the Error Matrix included at

Schedule 4 to the Third Supplemental Agreement,

   50.As I wasn't on the End to End Working Party, all that I feel able to comment

      on in relation to Schedule 4 is that these are references to the type of errors

      found at the TIP interface as examined by the Working Party.

Question 32: What was your understanding in January 2000 of the "defences"

which had been implemented by ICL Pathway in order to address ongoing

cash account discrepancies?

   51.The term or word "defences" isn't something I recall being used during my

      work on these matters. The three defensive measures referred to at note no.

      6 (page 24) of document FUJO0118186 relate to technical matters which I am

      unable to comment on.

Question 33: What did you understand the purpose and function of the

"attribute checker" to be?

   52.Again, this is not something that I recall being aware of at the time and the

      document doesn't help me to understand or recollect what the "attribute

      checker" was.

Question 34: What was your understanding in January 2000 as to the ability of

the integrity control to detect all relevant data errors in Horizon?

   53.As I have mentioned above and in my first statement, I do not remember

      being involved in January 2000, but I can only assume that all parties were

      satisfied that the data integrity control was capable by this stage of detecting

      all relevant data errors in Horizon.

Question 35: What did you understand ICL Pathway's obligation(s) to be in the

event that it could not establish the root cause of a cash account imbalance

and! or the appropriate corrective action to take to rectify the imbalance?

   54. My understanding is that Pathway were responsible for issues/errors caused

      by their system and would therefore need to provide a fix for any issues which

      were attributable to them.

PLEASE CONSIDER FUJ00080690

Question 36: Were you shown a copy of this report at or around the time it was

first produced in September 1998?

   55. 1 do not recall seeing this document. The author names do not mean anything

      to me. This was a Pathway only report as far as I can see.

Question 37: Were you aware, at the time, of the concerns expressed by ICL

Pathway developers within this report concerning the quality of the EPOSS

application, code and design?

   56. No.

Question 38: What (if any) impact would knowledge of these concerns have

had upon your handling of Acceptance Incident 376 had you been aware of

them at the time?

   57. This report appears to contain concerns attributable to the authors regarding

      matters between August and September 1998. I feel that it is impossible for

      me to say, had I know about this, whether this would have had any bearing on

      the process of dealing with Acceptance Incident 376, which was of course

      being worked on constantly from the Summer of 1999 onwards.

Question 39: Were you shown a copy of this audit report at or around the time

it was produced in October 1999?


   58. No.


Question 40: Were you aware, at the time, of the concerns expressed by ICL

Pathway auditors within this report concerning the quality of the EPOSS

application, code and design?


   59. No. I did not have any interaction with Pathway auditors.


Question 41: What (if any) impact would knowledge of these concerns have

had upon your handling of Acceptance Incident 376 had you been aware of

them at the time?


   60. 1 did not receive this document but note that it does highlight a number of

      issues with the ICL Pathway system/code. As I do not have a technical/IT

      background it is difficult for me to comment on whether these issues,

      contained in a report which is a snapshot view from September 1999, are

      significant in terms of the subsequent Core System Release which took plan

      in January 2000. It is now 2023 and I feel that it is impossible for me to say,

      had I know about this over 23 years ago, whether this would have had any

      bearing on the process for resolving Al 376. It was Pathway and not POCL's

      responsibility to develop their system in accordance with the requirements of

      private finance.
