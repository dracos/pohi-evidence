1 Introduction

Not all incidents and complaints that arise at the helpdesk can easily be resolved using
the incident management process [Ref.2]. Some incidents have a wide impact, some
may be difficult and time consuming to resolve, whilst others may arise as a result of a
single underlying issue. Therefore, some incidents may require referral to the Problem
Management process operated by ICL Pathway Customer Service.

A key element for success in the resolution of incidents and complaints that are
referred to ICL Pathway Customer service is an effective Problem Management and
Alert process.

Definitions of incidents and problems are given in ICL Pathways Policy Manual
(CS/QMS/001).

2 Scope

This document details the Problem Management process, which includes the raising
of alerts.

The scope begins at the point that a problem is identified. The process is divided up
into the major Problem Management elements as shown in the “Deployed Process”
within Section 3.

The scope includes the handling of Cross-Domain problems and the raising of
Divisional and Corporate alerts.

The diagram below highlights the feeds in and out of the problem management
process.

Each of the suppliers is able to identify problems that link in to the ICL Pathway
Customer Service Problem Management process. The customers are those who
potentially benefit from the resolution of a problem.

5 Problem Management Process

The process followed by the Problem Manager to ensure the resolution of a problem
depends upon whether the problem is internal to ICL Pathway, or a cross-domain
problem that requires interactions with a POL BSM Problem Manager.

5.1.4 Assign Problem Manager

The Duty Manager is informed of individual problems, problems maybe
communicated to the Duty Manager by the internal CS organisation or an external
source. The Duty Manager then identifies potential Problem Manager/s (PM) best
placed to manage the problem. Before a finial decision can be made the DM must
check the workload of the potential PM/s and assign the problem to an individual PM
whose workload can accommodate it. Any difficulties with assigning a PM are
discussed with the appropriate CS Line Managers.

5.1.2 Provide detaily of the Problew

The DM together with the problem originator provides the assigned PM with all the
available details of the Problem.

5.2.1 Log Problew

All the details of the problems, along with any action taken to date, must be logged on
the database [Ref.3]. This includes cross referencing the problem to any existing
incident numbers or linked PinICL numbers, and also the POL problem number if the
problem is a cross-domain Problem (see Section 5.3).

5.2.2 Anolyse Problew

The Problem Manager contacts the originator of the problem in order to understand, if
necessary, the problem more fully. It also allows the originator to know who the
Problem Manager is and be informed of the Problem Reference number. The Problem
Manager is then in a position to define the problem. If the problem already exists, the
originator is notified of the Problem Manager dealing with the existing problem.

5.2.3 Assess lmpoct

If the problem doesn’t already exist, the Problem Manager assesses the impact of the
problem. This allows the problem Manager to decide who is impacted by the problem
so that they can be informed and kept updated. In the case of a cross-domain Problem
information from the POL Problem Manager should be taken into account.

5.2.4 Prioritie

Having assessed the impact of the Problem the Problem Manager assigns a priority to
the problem. The priority defines how urgent the problem is.

The Problem Manager also determines the closure criteria for the problem, i.e. the
conditions under which the problem can be closed. This is also captured on the
database.

Tf required, the Problem Manager can request the HSH to set up a Master Incident to
capture incidents arising as a result of the problem. The priority of the problem could
subsequently increase (or be lowered) if the volumes of incidents arising changes
dramatically.

5.3.4 Agree Problem Owner

At this stage the Problem Manager must decide whether or not the Problem impacts
POL), i.e. a cross-domain Problem.

If the problem is identified as cross-domain the POL BSM Problem Management
team is contacted [Ref.1]. Once a POL BSM Problem Manager has been established
the Problem Managers from ICL Pathway and POL agree the priority of the problem,
and also decide which organisation is responsible for the resolution of the problem

5.3.2 Agree Action and Update plaw

A plan of action (including target dates) and an update schedule is then agreed with
the Resolution Owner. The Problem Manager is then in a position to monitor the
resolution progress and take action should any delays occur.

If the Problem is cross-domain, then having agreed which organisation is responsible
for the resolution of the problem, the Problem Managers agree the closure criteria, i.e.
the conditions under which the problem can be closed, and also an update schedule to
keep each other informed of progress.

5.3.3 Requirement for a Temporary Procedure

Whether the problem is cross-domain or internal to ICL Pathway, the Problem
Manager decides if a temporary procedure (TP) is required to address incidents arising
as a result of the problem whilst a permanent solution to the problem is being
developed. Ifa TP is required, see Section 5.7.

COMPANY IN CONFIDENCE Date: 26/11/01

5.4.1 Identify Root Cause

If ICL Pathway is responsible for the resolution of the Problem, whether or not it is an
internal problem or a cross-domain problem, the root cause of the problem must be
determined before any feasible solution can be developed. The level of investigation is
determined by the business impact and risk of the initial problem.

Please Refer to Corporate Customer Satisfaction Framework (If online double click on
Hyperlink) for more information on Root Cause Analysis.

5.4.2 Develop permanent solution

Having Investigation the root cause of the problem the Problem Manager ensures that
the resolution owner develops and proposes a permanent solution to the problem, all
the while keeping the Problem Manager updated with progress.

If responsibility for resolution lies within POL, the POL BSM Problem Manager
ensures that a proposed solution is developed.

5.4.3 Agree solution

If ICL Pathway is responsible for resolution, the Problem Manager agrees the
proposed solution with the resolution owner. If the problem is cross-domain, the
Problem Manager must also agree the solution with POL BSM PM.

If POL is responsible for the resolution of the problem, after having developed a
proposed solution, the POL BSM PM will agree the solution with the ICL Pathway
CS PM.

5.4.4 Implement solution

If ICL Pathway is responsible for the resolution, then after having agreed the proposed
solution, the Problem Manager ensures the process for implementing the change is
initiated. In many cases, this requires the initiation of the formal Change Management
process [Ref.4].

If POL is responsible for resolution, then once the solution has been agreed with the
ICL Pathway Problem Manager, the POL BSM Problem Manager ensures that the
solution is implemented.

5.5.1 Monitor Solution Implementation

The Problem Manager monitors the resolution and implementation of the problem to
ensure constant progress against deadlines. If deadlines are not being met, or progress
is slow, then if necessary, the Problem Manager can escalate (see Section 5.8) the
problem to ensure continuous progress against requirements.

In certain circumstances a problem can be suspended to save the Problem Manager
writing updates that do not add any further information or benefit to the Problem
Management database log. E.g. a resolution to a problem is due to be released into the
live estate within the next scheduled software release. The problem may be suspended

until the software release is run and the new resolution can be monitored. A problem
can only be suspended once it has been authorised by the senior problem Manager.

5.5.2 Solution Implemented

Once the solution has been implemented, the Problem Manager determines whether
the problem has been resolved. If not, then action must be taken to understand why the
problem still remains and to ensure that a solution is developed that resolves the
problem. Again, escalation may be used to ensure that resources are available to
develop a solution to meet target deadlines.

If the problem has been resolved, the Problem Manager can move on to closing the
problem.

5.6.1 Requirement for a PIR

Before the Problem is formally closed the Problem Manager decides if a Post
Implementation Review (PIR) is required. In the case of a Cross-Domain Problem,
either organisational Problem Manager can request a PIR. A PIR should take place if
the Problem Manager was unhappy with the way that the problem was resolved. The
Review should include all the main players within the resolution of the problem with a
view to running through the problem and determining which parts of the process could
have been implemented more efficiently. The end result is to initiate improvement
actions to ensure that the process is operated as it should be or ultimately improved.

The PIR is presided over by the Problem Manager who requested it.

If a PIR is has been carried out, this should be used as the authority to close the
problem. The problem is closed after all actions arising from the PIR have been
completed.

If the problem was cross-domain, it cannot be closed until agreed with the POL BSM

Problem Manager. If agreement is required from the POL BSM Problem Manager,
evidence of their agreement to close is required, i.e. letter, email, fax etc.

5.7.14 Temporary Procedure Development

If a Temporary Procedure (TP) is already in place then the Problem Manager
determines whether or not the TP meets current requirements. In the case of cross-
domain problems, the Problem Manager agrees with the POL BSM Problem if the
existing Temporary Procedure meets requirements.

Note: Cross-domain temporary procedures are agreed between the Problem Managers
of both organisations. Once agreed, the TP is known as an Authorised Temporary
Procedure (ATP).

If an existing TP meets current requirements then no further action is taken until the
TP is withdrawn.

If an existing TP does not meet current requirements, or no TP is yet in place, the
Problem Manager ensures that a TP is developed, recorded and registered, and finally
implemented. Development of the Temporary Procedure must include an
implementation and withdrawal plan.

If a cross-domain problem requires an ATP to be developed, the Problem Managers
agree which organisation is responsible for developing the ATP. The Problem
Manager of the organisation responsible for the development of the ATP ensures that
an ATP is developed. This is then agreed with their counterpart, recorded and
registered, and implemented.

5.7.2 Until Problem resolved

A TP remains in place until a permanent solution has been developed and
implemented. During this time, the Problem Manager(s) regularly review and monitor
a TP to ensure that it is working as it should.

5.7.3 Withdrawel of the Temporary Procedure

Once a permanent solution to the problem has been developed and implemented, the
temporary procedure is withdrawn. This must be carried out in a co-ordinated manner
alongside the implementation of the permanent solution.

potential Divisional Alert.

The Divisional Alert status is intended to bring increasing levels of management

should only be considered for use in exceptional circumstances.

impact, or

e It has not been possible to reach agreement on some aspect of the definition or
management of the Problem.

5.8.1.1 Specific to Process Box H1, H2, H3 and H4

If a Problem Manager or CS Service Manager feels that a problem is suffering from
any of the circumstances listed above then they can escalate the problem to the CS
Management Team. The CS Management Team will decide whether to raise a
Divisional Alert or not.

5.8.2 Manage Divisional Alert

5.8.2.1 Specific to Process Box H5

Divisional alert reporting for selected live problems is initiated by an instruction from
the CS Director or nominated person. A parallel instruction to the relevant CS
Problem Manager initiates the provision of problem updates.

from the CS Problem Manager. Alert reports are produced and sent to an agreed
distribution list until they are instructed to close the Alert from the CS Director or
nominated person.

progressed, passed on to the relevant CS Problem Manager and copied to the CS
Management Team and CS Director or nominated person.

Specific questions from ICL Pathway Directors are passed to CS Problem Managers
with a request to include an answer to the question in the next problem update. The
CS Management Team interacts directly with CS Problem Managers when required.

Note: If a cross-domain problem is being escalated, the Problem manager must ensure

that the counterpart organisational Problem Manager is informed so that escalation can
take place to the same level within the partner organisation. This ensures that the same
management levels are aware of the situation should they need to contact each other.

5.8.2.3 Specific to Process Box H7

ICL Pathway Directors (and other selected Pathway Managers) receive live problem
alert reports, and thereby remain aware of serious live problems.

ICL Pathway Directors interact with PON Senior Management as and when required.

For problems where action or a decision is required, they communicate Directives to
the appropriate ICL Pathway Directorate(s), e.g. change priorities, sanction additional
Tesource.

When appropriate, the CS Management Team responds directly to the ICL Pathway
Management Team, e.g. to answer a non-specific or general question.

In very exceptional circumstances, the ICL Pathway Management Team may use
standard procedures to escalate a selected live problem to ICL Corporate Red Alert
status (CSAC). Any questions or requests relating to the alert report are communicated
to CS Ops Support

5.8.2.4 CS Mgt team escalation to CSAC

In normal circumstances escalation to CSAC will be at the discretion of the ICL PW
Management Team. However, in exceptional circumstances, e.g. Severe Business
Continuity, the CS Director or nominated person may raise an alert directly with
CSAC and provide notification to the ICL PW Management team in Parallel.
