Witness Name: Gareth James
Statement No.: WITN09750100
Dated: 20 April 2024
POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY
FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF GARETH JAMES
I, Gareth James will say as follows:-
BACKGROUND
1. I am a former employee (from 1997) and Partner (from 2011) of Deloitte

LLP ("Deloitte" also referred to as "we" and "us"). I left Deloitte to join EY LLP

("EY") in 2015. This witness statement is made to assist the Post Office Horizon

IT Inquiry (the “ Inquiry” ) with the matters set out in the Rule 9 Request dated 9
October 2023 (the “Request” ). This statement will focus on answering the 31
questions outlined in the Request and will refer to a number of associated

documents. I have been assisted by my legal representative, David Young of

Addleshaw Goddard LLP, in drafting this statement.

WITNO9750100

2. I graduated from Nottingham University in 1997 with a Masters in
Engineering and joined Deloitte & Touche LLP (which in 2008 became Deloitte
LLP) as an auditor in its Nottingham office. I qualified as a chartered accountant
in 2001, which is when I started specialising in IT Risk and Analytics services for
both external and intemal audit functions. I relocated from Nottingham to Leeds

in 2001, from where I continue to be based today at EY.

3. I left Deloitte and moved to EY in 2015. I now lead EY's audit data
analytics specialists across the UK as well as leading on EMEIAservice delivery

model transformation strategies.

OVERVIEW OF MY WORK IN RELATION TO HORIZON IT

4. I have been asked about my recollection of Deloitte’s engagements with the
Post Office Limited ("POL") in relation to its Horizon IT system. In order to provide
context to the later detail in this statement, I can say as follows by way of

introductory remarks.

5. It is important to note that reference to the 'Horizon IT system' suggests that
there has been a single system in place since it was first introduced. This is not
correct; the system went through a significant upgrade in or around 2010. The work
I performed whilst at Deloitte only related to the upgraded version referred to as
‘Horizon Online’, 'HNG' and/or 'HNG-X,' where the acronym to my recollection

translated as “Horizon Next Generation”. I shall refer to that version of the Horizon

Page 20f 39
WITNO09750100
WITNO9750100

system throughout this witness statement as "HNG-X." My work did not extend to
the original or older Horizon system (pre-2010), also referred to as ‘Legacy Horizon’

("Legacy Horizon System").

6. Projects (or potential projects) connected with HNG-X that I was involved in

during my time at Deloitte are described in more detail in the paragraphs below.

7. POL first approached Deloitte to scope potential work relating to HNG-
X in 2012. This was Project Spire, which I think was the POL name given to it, but

we were not appointed by POL to do the actual work.

8. There were also initial discussions with POL around Project Zebra in 2012,
however as further detailed in this statement we did not begin work on this
engagement until 2014. Project names were allocated within Deloitte whenever we
undertook work which was legally privileged so that teams could discuss the work
without concern over revealing a client's identity internally or inadvertently. Project
Zebra was definitely the Deloitte project name. This was the only project I worked on
that related to assessing the reliability of aspects of HNG-X. As explained later in
this statement, our engagement was limited to a desktop review of the Third-Party
Assurance Work (see paragraph 29) already undertaken by other advisers for

POL.

9. I also worked on matters for POL under an internal audit co-source
engagement from 2008 (the "Co-Source Engagement"). Such engagements are
common and refer to an arrangement in which a third-party auditor works for a
company's own internal audit function to support the delivery of their agreed annual

intemal audit plan.

Page 3 of 39
WITNO09750100
WITNO9750100

10. I My work under the Co-Source Engagement did not however involve any
assessment of the reliability of HNG-X or the Legacy Horizon System, rather it
focused on other POL systems (such as POL SAP) and financial business
processes within POL that, in some cases, used data from the Horizon IT System in

use at the time of the internal audit work.

THE ISMAY REPORT

11. I have been asked about my recollections regarding the Ismay Report in

2010. As far as I can recall I have never seen the Ismay Report.

2012/13 ASSURANCE REVIEWS

12. I have also been asked a series of questions relating to my involvement in

producing a number of work products referenced in question 4 of the Request.

13. I contributed to the production of these work products for Derek Foster,
POL's then Head of Internal Audit and Risk Management under the Co-Source

Engagement.

14. This work did not involve any assessment of the reliability of the Horizon IT

System (HNG-X or Legacy).

PROJECT SPIRE

15. I have been asked questions around my involvement in preparing a number

of discussion documents referenced in question 5 of the Request

16. The documents relating to Project Spire were prepared by myself and my

team in response to an invitation from POL. We were invited to share our initial

Page 4 0f 39
WITNO09750100
WITNO9750100

thoughts on how some of the objectives in relation to risks and control measures
present within the HNG-X system could be addressed by Deloitte specialist teams to
help POL assess the reliability of the computer processing environment. The
‘processing environment refers to the combination of IT processes and controls
within POL, or their third-party suppliers, which underpin the operation of the HNG-X

system.

17. We were not ultimately instructed on Project Spire.

PROJECT ZEBRA

2012: Initial scoping options discussions

18. I recall that after our Project Spire proposal, but still in 2012, POL was keen
to understand if and how Deloitte could undertake some work that would enable us
to provide an opinion on the integrity of the HNG-X processing environment, and so

we had a further discussion with POL.

19. These discussions with POL resulted in the production of the Project Zebra
scoping options document (POL00116802), which identified some commonly used

intemational standards that can be used as the basis of formal assurance opinions.

20. The Project Zebra paper was built upon the Project Spire proposal and
outlined three possible engagement options identified by us. Deloitte was not
engaged by POL to proceed with the work in 2012; scoping and drafting the

eventual engagement parameters of Project Zebra did not occur until 2014.

WITNO09750100
WITNO9750100

21. I WhistI cannot recall the specific detail of meetings and their content, my
primary contact in respect of the 2012 proposals for Project Spire and Project Zebra

was Rod Ismay.

22. Questions 6 and 7 of the Request ask for my comments on my view at the
time of what type of review was required in order properly to investigate whether the
Horizon IT System was sufficiently robust to produce data that could be relied upon
either (a) for management or statutory accounts or (b) prosecutions, and whether I
believed POL had carried out such a review when I was preparing the discussion

documents in 2012.

23. My recollection of my view at the time aligns with the content of the Project
Spire and Zebra discussion documents the Inquiry has provided with the Request
(referenced in paragraph 15 and 19 above). These options are common
approaches for the provision of independently gathered information and assurance
relating to IT risks and the preparation of management and statutory accounts,
which management (and/or their legal team) in tum would need to assess in the
context of their specific needs and wider work. I cannot comment upon what could
be relied upon for prosecutions as this is beyond my area of expertise and it would
presumably depend on the options chosen by the client for work to be done. What
we knew in terms of scoping work that we could do for POL is reflected in the

discussion documents.

24. As the audit analytics lead for Deloitte at the time, I was aware that POL was
undertaking various discrete data-driven reconciliations tying Horizon data to other

systems and ledgers, but I did not understand that POL had done any substantial

Page 6 of 39
WITNO9750100

WITNO09750100
end-to-end independent data-driven assessments relating to the reliability of
processing.
25. I cannot recall and therefore comment on any other reviews or projects POL
was involved in at the time.
2013: Second Sight's draft interim report
26. I have been asked in question 8 of the Request to provide an explanation as

to why I was sent a copy of the Second Sight's draft interim report in July 2013.

27. _ I recall receiving the email provided with question 8 of the Request
(FUJ00087091) which attached the Second Sight draft interim report. However, it
was not made clear why this was sent to me and I do not recall requesting or
reading the report. I note that at that time I had not been appointed to do work for
POL on HNG-X and I thus had no mandate to read such detailed, confidential third-

party information.

2014: Project Zebra

a) Engagement and scope

28. Deloitte was engaged by POL by way of an Engagement Letter dated 9 April
2014 ("Engagement Letter") (POL00108464) to undertake a desktop review (see
paragraph 30) and provide an ‘independently-produced summary of the
assurance and other work undertaken, over [POL's] current day Horizon
HNG-X system,( for presentation to and discussion with the POL Board
[during a meeting on 30 April 2014]' (the "Board Meeting"). This summary

document is referred to as the Deliverable (as defined below).

Page 7 of 39
WITNO09750100
WITNO9750100

29. The ‘assurance and other work undertaken, over [POL's] current day
Horizon HNG-X system’ that Deloitte was engaged to review is detailed in

Appendix 1 to the Engagement Letter (the "Third-Party Assurance Work").

30. ‘Desktop review' in this context means that Deloitte was not engaged to
conduct testing of the HNG-X system necessary to provide an opinion on the
completeness, accuracy and quality of the Third Party Assurance Work, but
instead and as per the Engagement Letter the ‘work [was to be] preformed
through a combination of a desk-based inspection of documentation,
corroborative enquiry and through third party-provided evidence or contact...'
in order to provide an overview of the Third-Party Assurance Work already

undertaken.

31. The reference made to ‘Horizon HNG-X' in the Engagement Letter is
important. It is clearly stated that [only] matters relating to the Horizon HNG-X
processing environment will be considered in our review. We will not consider
any information relating to the legacy Horizon system...' This makes it clear that
the scope of our work only related to the HNG-X system. The Legacy Horizon
System was excluded from our Scope (defined below) as we were informed that all

data from the pre-2010 system had been deleted.

32. Prior to finalising the Engagement Letter, my team and I considered
possible assumptions or conclusions that might be reached by POL in error or
by overestimating the nature and extent of our work, as a result of the

instructions and how to address them.

Page 8 of 39,
WITNO09750100
WITNO9750100

33. I recall being conscious that our Deliverable could be misinterpreted by
POL as providing complete assurance over the HNG-X System itself, rather than an
assessment of the Third-Party Assurance Work. The following mitigations were
identified and included:

i. I Agreeing in the Engagement Letter that our Scope was to review and
summarise the Third-Party Assurance Work rather than providing direct
assurance on the HNG-X System itself.

ii. I Ensuring there were ongoing communications with the POL Client Team
(defined below) to emphasise the parameters of our Scope (as per (i)
above).

iii. Highlighting clearly in our Deliverable the work we had and had not

undertaken.

34. We were from the outset concerned that we would not be able to conclude
our review and finalise our Deliverable within POL's required timescale. We

therefore agreed with POL that we would limit our Scope by dividing it into two parts.

35. Part 1 of the instruction, as a desktop review, did not include testing or
implementation of the control measures identified in the HNG-X System. Part 1
related only to gathering an understanding of the system, existing assurance
sources over key IT risks and whether there appeared any key gaps in controls or
assurance provided (the ‘assurance map’). My intent was that, based on such part 1
information and understanding, more targeted independent testing and data

analytics could be performed, if required by POL, in an anticipated part 2.

36. I Akey reason behind a two-part proposal was that there was limited time

within which Deloitte was asked to complete a Deliverable. It was not possible both

Page 9 of 39
WITNO09750100
WITNO9750100

to appropriately scope and then carry out the testing needed to assess the control
measures in the time within which POL required a Deliverable to be concluded. This
is made clear by the assumptions upon which Deloitte's work was to be
based, as detailed in the Engagement Letter. We stated that ‘Deloitte will not
verify or test any information provided directly by [POL], or indirectly by third
parties’ and ‘Deloitte will adopt a time-limited approach to our work dependent

on the accuracy of the assumptions."

37.  Asstated, the outcome of part 1 would inform whether part 2 was required by
POL and, if so, which specific areas of risk should be targeted. However as detailed
further in this statement, I never received approval from POL to (i) conclude part 1

with the submission of a final part 1 report and (ii) begin part 2.

38. Project Zebra was therefore designed to provide services in two parts ("the

Services").

39. Part 1 of the Services was ‘to provide, based upon the information made
available to [Deloitte] by [POL], an independently produced summary of the
assurance and other work undertaken, [POL's] current day Horizon HNG-X system,
for presentation and discussion with the POL Board.'In summary, this was to
include the following:

(i) Obtain an understanding of the general allegations we were hearing and
which were being reported in the media that the "Horizon HNG-X" IT system,
used to record transactions in Post Office branches, was defective and/or
that the processes associated with it were inadequate; the key risks in and
intemal controls over the Horizon HNG-X processing environment relevant to

the integrity of processing; the measures in place to record and preserve the

Page 10 of 39
40.

WITNO09750100
WITNO9750100

integrity of system audit trails and other background matters that Deloitte
may deem necessary to complete our Deliverable (defined below). The intent
of this part of the Scope was to explore with POL which parts of the
processes sub-postmasters were alleging were not working.

(ii) Obtain an understanding of the key differences between the current
hardware and software used to make up the Horizon HNG-X System,
compared to that of the Legacy Horizon system. It is important to note that
this did not involve providing any assurance as to the integrity of the Legacy
Horizon System because as I have indicated already my recollection is that
we were told that no data from Legacy Horizon was retained so this part of
the Scope was simply to understand what had changed in the transition from
Legacy Horizon to HNG-X.

(iii) Review, understand and consolidate the existing Third-Party Assurance
Work (as was detailed in Appendix 1 to the Engagement Letter).

(iv) Hold discussions with relevant members of POL staff and other key
stakeholders as pre-agreed with POL.

(v) Prepare a report on findings in the format and with the details outlined in
section 2(d) of the Engagement Letter (the "Deliverable").

(vi) Attend twice-weekly meetings or conference calls with the POL client team
("Client Team"), to explain Deloitte's approach, status of work and
commentary within our Deliverable.

(together referred to as the "Scope")

The POL Client Team consisted of Lesley Sewell, Chief Information Officer;

Chris Aujard, General Counsel; Belinda Crowe, Programme Director; and Rodric

Williams, Litigation Lawyer. The Client Team was to report on the Project Zebra

Page 11 of 39
WITNO09750100
WITNO9750100

engagement to Paula Vennells, POL Chief Executive. My POL points of contact
throughout the project were Chris Aujard and Rodric Williams in POL Legal ("POL
Legal Team") and the majority of meetings and conference calls (as per (vi) above)

were only attended by POL Legal Team representatives.

41. There were a number of limitations to the work Deloitte was able to conduct
which are reflected in the Scope. These have been mentioned above and detailed
further below in the statement, but include:

(i) a review of the HNG-X System which was introduced in 2010 but excluding a
review of the Legacy Horizon System;

(ii) excluding testing and implementation of the HNG-X processing environment
to determine whether risk related control measures were sufficient to confirm
the reliability of the HNG-X System in practice as a result of time constraints;
and

(iii) as a result of (ii) above, only conducting a desktop review of the Third-Party
Assurance Work already undertaken in relation to the reliability of the HNG-X

System and not testing the quality, completeness or accuracy of this advice.

42. As a result of limitations, the work conducted by Deloitte had to be
based upon a number of assumptions, most importantly, those detailed in
paragraph 41 above. This meant that the work conducted by Deloitte had to
presume the accuracy of statements made and information provided by third parties
as to the design of the system and how this worked in practice; Deloitte was not

instructed to question or test the accuracy of such statements or information.

43. I was the Deloitte Partner responsible for provision of the Services.

Page 12 of 39
WITNO09750100
WITNO9750100

44. ~My role included leading a team of IT and data risk specialists; day-to-day
liaison with the POL Legal Team; attending twice-weekly meetings with the POL
Legal Team (which happened in lieu of the twice-weekly meetings with the Client
Team anticipated in our Engagement Letter), to provide an update on findings and
progress; planning and reviewing outputs from interviews with POL and Fujitsu staff
(which were carried out by individuals in my team) and assessment of
documentation provided by POL and third parties plus attending a meeting with the
POL Board (as requested by the POL Legal Team) and, finally, drafting the

Deliverable in accordance with the Engagement Letter provisions.

b) The Board Meeting (held on 30 April 2014)

45. I have been asked a series of questions throughout the Request
regarding my involvement and attendance at this Board Meeting. As
mentioned in paragraph 28 above and as outlined in our Engagement Letter,
Deloitte was to produce the Deliverable for presentation to the POL Board at
the Board Meeting. To be clear the Board meeting referred to was that held

on 30 April 2014.

46. —_ I attended only part of this Board Meeting in order to address one item on the
agenda relating to Project Zebra, for which Chris Aujard was the owner/sponsor.
An outline of what was discussed in relation to this is detailed under HORIZON —
DELOITTE REPORT at POLB 14/55 of the Board minutes (POL00027411). My

recollection is that I was in the room for less than an hour.

47. —Anumber of draft versions of the Deliverable were produced and circulated

to Chris Aujard and/or Rodric Williams prior to the Board Meeting. There were 16

Page 13 of 39
WITNO09750100
WITNO9750100

draft versions of the Deliverable in total, but not all of these were shared with the
POL Legal Team as some version changes were the result of Deloitte internal
review procedures. The draft Deliverable had a number of different titles throughout
the drafting process, including ‘Project Zebra —- Phase 1 Report: HNG-X Review of
Assurance Sources’ (POL00105635) and ‘Horizon: Desktop Review of Assurance

Sources and Key Control Features. '(POL00028062).

48. I cannot recall which versions of the draft Deliverable were shared with the

POL Legal Team, and which versions resulted from Deloitte internal reviews.

49. Asoutlined in our Engagement Letter, it was my assumption that the POL
Legal Team was keeping senior POL stakeholders appropriately informed and
sighted on our work. It was not expressly mentioned in the Board Meeting whether
the Board members had received a draft version of our Deliverable (as shared with
the POL Legal Team). The ‘contents and key extracts' report referred to below (see
paragraph 51) formed the primary basis of discussion in the Board Meeting.
However, I assumed at the time that the Board members had access to the draft
Deliverable for three reasons; first the purpose of the Deliverable was for the Board
Meeting; second, the summary document presented at the Board Meeting
(see paragraph 50 and 51 below) made clear reference to the Deliverable;

and, third, they thanked me for it during the meeting.

50. Asour final Deliverable was taking shape, there were requests from the
POL Legal Team to produce further documentation. For example, due to the
length and detail of our Deliverable we agreed to produce a ‘contents and key
extracts' (POLO0105635) document to frame the discussions for the purposes of the

Board Meeting. As part of this discussion document, we were asked to make

Page 14 of 39
WITNO09750100
WITNO9750100

summary statements from our work on any issues we had found. Given our
concems on misinterpretation from our work (see paragraphs 32 and 33 above), this
led to the form of words written into the ‘contents and key extracts’ document, and
attention drawn to specific matters such as the understanding we had obtained over

balancing transactions.

51. I was not aware of anything else discussed by the Board before or after my
attendance. At the time of the Board Meeting, our Deliverable was in a mature draft,
and was very detailed, so (as I have explained above) the “content and key extracts”
document was prepared by Deloitte (at the request of the POL Legal team) to seek

to highlight key points for the Board discussion.

52. The output from the Board Meeting was a request for me to consider the
following key matters:

i. ‘Inthe context of specific allegations regarding non-traceable, "phantom"
transactions existing in Horizon— what assurance could be provided over
how the system records and maintains the transaction logs;

ii. In wider context, what further assurance could be given both pre and post

2010 (when there was a change in the Horizon system in use).'

53. This led to changes to our Scope which are detailed in subsequent

paragraphs below.

54. I have been asked in question 16 of the Request to comment
specifically upon my impression on the leadership style, the effectiveness of
the Board (including its understanding of IT) and what I considered the

Board’s purpose was in inviting me to the Board Meeting. My primary contacts

Page 15 of 39
WITNO09750100
WITNO9750100

in POL for this work were the POL Legal Team, and my exposure to the
Board was limited to attendance at a single Board meeting to discuss one
agenda item which was the work commissioned in the Engagement Letter. I
am not able to comment beyond that. The Engagement Letter was the result
of discussions in early April 2014 with the POL Legal Team and that details
what I understood at the time, which included the planned attendance at the

Board Meeting.

55. I have also been asked to comment upon a direct quote from the Board
Minutes which reads ‘Deloitte’s views would need to be expressed in such a
way that they would persuade reasonable lay people.'I do not directly recall this
comment, reflected in the minute at POLB14/55(d) nor what the context may have
been, but it is not unusual for clients to ask us to use non-technical language, as far

as reasonable, in our Deliverables.

56. — With regards to the question as to whether I consider the minute at POLB
14/55(d) to be a full and accurate account of what I said to the Board, I would
say that the Minute is plainly not a verbatim account of what was said, rather a
summary of a more contextual and detailed conversation. I was not provided with
a copy of the minutes or asked to comment on their accuracy at the time. In
terms of further detail, I do recall talking the Board through our Scope in greater
detail than is reflected, to ensure (for example) that the Board appreciated that our
work on the HNG-X system did not cover the Legacy Horizon System and that our
work had not engaged in testing, so was reliant on the completeness and accuracy

of documentation and answers to questions. A further example of the greater detail

Page 16 of 39
WITNO09750100
WITNO9750100

discussed can be seen from the actions I was asked to take away (described in

paragraph 52).

c) Changes in Scope

57. I Asmentioned above, the Scope of our work expanded following the Board
Meeting. The change order dated 6 May 2014 (the "Change Order")
(POL00117612) referenced in question 17 of the Requestclarified further items that

the POL Board required Deloitte to perform as part of its part 1 activities.

58. The reason for this extension is summarised in the Board Briefing
(defined below); ‘as [part 1] work progressed it became apparent that in some
key areas [Third-Party Assurance Work] was either not relevant or could not
be located by POL. For example, because the Horizon On-Line modification in
2010 was found to have not significantly impacted features relating to the
integrity of processing, the scope of testing did not identify and test such
features; nor had any work been performed to test relevant in-built controls in

Horizon and its surrounding business controls, other than access controls.’

59. On6 May 2014, we were, therefore, instructed to extend our desktop review
and assemble an initial schedule of key control features in HNG-X from the existing
additional documentation received from POL and Fujitsu. For clarity, the findings
from this extension of our Scope were integrated into version 16 of our draft

Deliverable, mentioned above.

60. A final draft of our Deliverable (version 16) was issued to the POL Legal
Team on 23 May 2014 (POL00028062). It was described as a draft because POL

had requested that we keep it that way until they indicated it could be marked as

Page 17 of 39
WITNO09750100
WITNO9750100

final. POL never did ask for version 16 of the draft to be converted into a final version
and instead asked us to produce the shorter Board Briefing mentioned in paragraph
62 below. I eventually assumed this was no longer a priority for POL and thus
version 16 is what I consider to be the final version of the Deliverable. This version of

the Deliverable included the outputs from the Change Order.

61. The Change Order is referenced alongside a document entitled
‘Deloitte - HNG-X: Review of Assurance Sources — Discussion Areas re:
Phase 2 - Draft For Discussion’ (POLO0031384) in question 17 of the
Request. This document was produced to assist in scoping further part 1
work, as ultimately agreed and signed off by Chris Aujard following requests

made in the Board Meeting.

62. Deloitte also produced a further document for a subsequent POL Board
meeting. In our Change Order this is referred to as a Board update document’ but it
was ultimately finalised under the title ‘Board Briefing’ (POL00028069) dated 4 June

2014.

63. I The Board Briefing addressed five matters (collectively the 'Matters') where
‘the design and operation of the ‘Horizon Features’ were critical to supporting POL's
legal position.’ These were:-
i. Horizon only allows complete baskets of transactions to be processed,
ii. I Baskets being communicated between Branch and Data Centre are not
subject to tampering before being copied into the Audit Store (defined

below);

Page 18 of 39
WITNO09750100
WITNO9750100

iii. Baskets of transactions recorded to the Audit Store are complete and
‘digitally sealed’, to protect their integrity and make it evident if they have
been tampered with;

iv. Horizon's Audit Store maintains and reports from a complete and unchanged
record of all sealed baskets; and

v. _ Horizon provides visibility to Sub-postmasters of all centrally-generated

transactions processed to their Branch ledgers.

64. The Horizon Features'were those (a) built directly into HNG-X to exert
control over processing; (b) relating to IT management activities over HNG-X and (c)
relating to POL's business processes that use HNG-X. We defined these as being

features:

'...deemed relevant by POL to their objectives if they supported the statements
that Sub-postmasters have full ownership and visibility of all records in their
Branch ledger, and that audit trails kept by Horizon are complete and

accurate’.

65. As outlined in the Board Briefing, no documentation from the Legacy Horizon
System's implementation in 1995 remained available and so we were unable to
conduct a desktop review of features of this system. However, a review of the
documentation and interview responses relating to the HNG-X system, combined
with verbal statements from Fujitsu that the Legacy Horizon System's key design
features were the same as HNG-X suggested that, if implemented and operating
effectively, such features would support the robust operation of the system. The
identified features were reported in the final version of our Deliverable (see

paragraph 60), however for the reasons stated above we could not provide

Page 19 of 39
WITNO09750100
WITNO9750100

any assurance that such features were actually built into the Legacy Horizon

System.

66. _I have been asked in question 19 of the Request to comment upon the
nature and extent of the Centera configuration issue identified in an email to

Rodric Williams on 20 May 2014 (POL00029728) to which I was in copy.

67.  Centera is the bespoke hardware on which the Audit Store data resides.
The Audit Store is the part of the HNG-X system where histories of detailed branch
transactions are maintained (with wider audit trail information, such as system and
user identification data points). In addition to software application controls, we were
told by Fujitsu that the Audit Store used bespoke hardware that gave additional
assurance that data in the Audit Store was preserved reliably. This hardware
(Centera) can be configured to differing degrees of security (Centera CE+ as

opposed to Centera Basic).

68. During our work, we identified conflicting information on how Centera (the
Audit Store hardware) was configured, and so members of my team asked Fujitsu
to confirm the facts. Some responses had suggested that HNG-X was configured
to CE+ mode. The system was subsequently confirmed to be configured to the

Basic mode only.

69. In CE+ mode, data could only be edited on-site (by administrators, physically
present at the hardware), whereas in Basic mode, editing could be performed by
administrators remotely. I recall that, from a risk point of view, this difference had little
significant impact on the wider overall HNG-X control environment for the reasons

outlined below.

70. We were informed by Fujitsu that changes could only be made by a limited
number of individuals with administrator access (not ‘ordinary Fujitsu staff’),
regardless of whether this was performed remotely or on-site. Any such access was
logged by the system, which also had ‘digital seal’ arrangements in place on
records, making editing detectable (with the exception of the unusual but technically

feasible work-around set out below).

71. I The absence of remote management capabilities in the CE+ mode makes it
marginally more secure, but as explained above we considered access rights,
logging and digital seals (all included in Basic mode) the key controls to preserve

data integrity.

72. The reference to the ‘delete and replace’ scenario explores the technical
feasibility that instead of ‘editing’ a transaction, an administrative user could ‘delete
and replace’ a transaction in the Audit Store. Although we found this technically
possible to do (by someone with access, who could also reinstate a formal digital
seal), we were informed by Fujitsu staff that we interviewed that this was not done

by Fujitsu administrators.

73. Based on what we were told by Fujitsu staff, an ordinary Fujitsu employee
would not have the requisite access rights to perform such transaction deletion and
reinsertion in the Audit Store. I also recall my team reporting that Fujitsu staff had to
investigate to see if it would actually be possible. The technical feasibility of this
workaround and the lack of documentation was reported in our Board Briefing and

Deliverable.

WITNO9750100

74. I should reiterate that, being a desktop review, and as highlighted
extensively in our Deliverable and other documents, our Scope excluded
implementation and operating effectiveness testing. Accordingly, there was no
evidence beyond the verbal assertions and documentation we received from either
POL or Fujitsu of these stated measures being in place and operating. As outlined
in the Deliverable, we were reliant upon the accuracy of statements made as
it was not in Scope for us to verify] or [test] any information provided directly

by POL, or directly or indirectly by third parties.’

75. Our findings in relation to this were included in the Board Briefing

(POL00028069) :-

‘We have not identified any documented controls designed to:

Prevent a person with authorised privileged access from deleting a digitally
sealed group of data and replacing it with a fake’ group within the Audit Store
(which could still have a valid digital signature, if they have access to keys, and

a valid digital seal created using a publicly available formula).'

d) Work products produced by Deloitte

76. Due to changes in part 1 scope agreed in the Change Order (as detailed

above) we ultimately produced the following documentation:

i. A full draft report detailing the findings of our review of the Third-Party
Assurance Work relating to the HNG-X System. This was referred to as

the 'Deliverable' (POL00028062) in our Engagement Letter. There were

Page 22 of 39
WITNO09750100
WITNO9750100

various iterations with differing titles. The final draft version (version 16)
was dated 23 May 2014.

ii. I a'contents and key extracts document’ summarising the findings of the
above-mentioned Deliverable for a discussion with the POL Board that
occurred during the Board Meeting.

iii. I A Board Briefing document produced at the request of the POL Board

following the Board Meeting which addressed five key matters.

77. With reference to draft versions of the Board Briefing, I have been
asked (with reference to the quote (POL00031391 and POL00029726) in
question 18b of the Request) what I would consider a ‘significant deficiency in the
identified design features’. It would be a risk that does not have a suitably designed
intemal control response. For example, a risk of transactions being created, edited,
or deleted by unauthorised individuals would be a significant deficiency unless

intemal controls such as system access controls were in place.

78. Question 20 of the Request focuses on a document entitled 'Deloitte —
Horizon Desktop Review of Assurance Sources and Key Control Features, Draft for
Discussion, dated 23 May 2014’ (POL00028062). This document is version 16 of

the Deliverable (see paragraph 76 above for further details).

79. Question 20c of the Request, asks that I consider a specific quote taken from

the Deliverable? and comment upon what it means for the Horizon system

' “nothing has come to our attention that suggests there are significant deficiencies in the identified design features..."
2" The extensive Horizon system documentation is structured from a technical rather than a risk and controls perspective and

provides an understanding of the Horizon Features. POL should conduct a formal assessment to identify a complete
set of Horizon Features that respond to POL’s control objectives.

Page 23 of 39
WITNO09750100
WITNO9750100

documentation to be structured from a technical rather than risk and controls

perspective’.

80. IThe documentation provided to us was of an operational nature i.e. how
HNG-X worked in practice rather than covering governance and risk management.
For example, we were provided with a number of policies and procedures relating to
the configuration and running of the system but were not provided with the risk
and control matrices which would have highlighted what risk management controls

are required and why.

81. As to whether it was common practice for similar projects undertaken
by Deloitte not to include testing (see question 20d of the Request in relation
to a quote from the Deliverable on limitations®), I would say this is not
uncommon in reviews of this nature. However, such a short amount of time in
which to report on complex matters is far less common. It is evident from our
communications with POL referenced in question 20 of the Request, that we
accommodated POL’s tight timetables by focusing our Scope on part 1 Services
(see paragraph 39 above for further details). The Scope Limitations detailed on

pages 5 to 6 of the Deliverable were not constraints to the conduct of our work.

82. The key item in the Scope Limitations which limited our ability to understand

the facts of the full Horizon IT system, is the final bullet on page 5 of our Deliverable:

‘Our work was limited by significant gaps existing in the information available,
relating to both the granulantty of information and the existence of the Horizon

Features over the entire timeline of operation of Horizon. The effect of which

° “the Assurance Work we have assessed does not completely test these features for implementation and operating effectiveness”

Page 24 of 39
WITNO09750100
WITNO9750100

is that there are gaps within what we are able to comment upon over this

timeline.’

83. This limitation meant the full history of the Horizon Features could not be
determined, in particular pre-2010 where documentation was not available and
Fujitsu staff unable to recall or clarify key facts for us, due to the Legacy system no

longer being available.

84. I believe the assumptions on page 6 of our Deliverable (see question 20f of
the Request) were appropriate because our Scope did not extend to detection or

consideration of those risks; it was important to highlight this point.

85. My team looked at the issues mentioned in question 20g of the Request:
“Branch 14 Issue”, “Branch 62 Issue”, “Falkirk Issue” and the “Lepton Detailed Spot
Review Information.” As detailed in the Deliverable, these were matters we
identified from the documents provided by POL which ‘helped to provide us
with a high-level understanding of the nature and extent of potential concerns
with the Horizon processing environment, and thus focus our work in certain
higher risk areas." All these matters related to alleged processing errors and

anomalies in the HNG-X system that resulted in accounting discrepancies.

86. Such specific accusations of error (see paragraph 85) helped to inform our
wider understanding that led to the creation of the risk diagram on page 4 of the
final Deliverable. This part of the work was undertaken to understand potential

risks in respect of which assurance sources may be required.

Page 25 of 39
WITNO09750100
WITNO9750100

87. Three assurance reports are identified at page 25 (ISO 27001, ISAE 3402
and PCI DSS) of our Deliverable and I have been asked to summarise the
degree of assurance I believe POL could take from these. Whilst all of the
reports are formal sources of assurance, it is important to understand the purpose
for which they are individually intended and whether they can, in aggregate, provide
the assurance that POL management required in respect of key risks. Our view on
limitations and points of consideration relevant to each was outlined on page 25 of

our Deliverable.

88. Our key point in this section was that the Third-Party Assurance Work was
primarily focused on information security risks rather than operations and change
management risks. We also highlighted to POL (see Appendix 2 of our Deliverable)
that it would be important to ensure these detailed Horizon Features had suitable

sources of assurance either identified or performed.

89. Question 20j of the Request asks how the 'Level of Comfort’ was

assessed as “Partial” for the following matter:

‘For any outstanding (non-accepted) Transaction Acknowledgement or Transaction
Corrections at month end, a formal resolution process exists which enables non-
accepted items to be identified, held in suspense and actively investigated to the
point of resolution with the Sub-postmaster. Business as usual resolution activities

can be taken to conclude outstanding items and have them cleared down’.

90. From what! recall, the Level of Comfort was assessed as partial for that

particular matter, as processes were reported to exist to clear such non-accepted

Page 26 of 39
WITNO09750100
WITNO9750100

items with Sub-postmasters but these items were not always cleared on a timely

basis.

91. With reference to the Board Briefing, question 23c of the Request asks
that I consider a particular quote® and clarify what is meant by ‘the matters

explicitly drawn out in [the] full report’ that I considered went against the stated
objectives. Here the Board Briefing is referring to the ‘Matters for Consideration’

contained in Section 6 of the Deliverable.

92. I am also asked to provide a view on the extent to which the findings in
our Deliverable and other work products, such as the Board Briefing, cast any
doubt over (a) the integrity of the Horizon IT System or (b) the safety of past
convictions that relied on data produced by the Horizon IT System (HNG-X or
Legacy). On (a) I have tried to explain in this statement the limitations on what
we were asked or indeed could do both in the time we had and in the absence
of more data and information relating to Legacy. That is why I was careful in
the Engagement Letter and Scope to have clarity and acknowledgement. The
Board Briefing provides the best summary of what we were able to conclude.
On (b) we were never asked to address that question and I am not qualified or
competent to express a specific view but in general terms I do not think our
work cast doubt, rather it stopped short of confirming that assurance sources
were in place to provide comfort that the system was operating reliably, and

went on to recommend further areas of work, targeting key potential risks, to

5 “Based on the desktop review we have performed, except for the lack of monitoring controls and the matters explicitly drawn
out in our full report, we have not become aware of anything to suggest that the system as designed would not deli ver the
objectives of processing of baskets of transactions and keeping copies of them in the Audit Store with integrity”

Page 27 of 39
WITNO09750100
WITNO9750100

verify if key internal controls that were key to the reliable operation of the

system were operating effectively or not.

e) Correspondence and discussions with POL and third parties

93. I have been asked to comment on a number of emails and discussions
between myself and different members of the POL Client Team. I will address

each of these interactions in the following paragraphs.

94. Prior to any references to specific discussions, however, I am asked to
provide an overview of key conversations I had with POL or Fujitsu
representatives. Given the passage of time, I cannot now recall sufficient detail to
provide such an overview. However, I recall that as the engagement was conducted
under legal professional privilege, communication was managed primarily via the
POL Legal Team and those who facilitated access to anyone we wanted to speak
to. Those to whom we requested access are listed in the appendix to our

Deliverable. My specific recollections are set out in the following paragraphs.

95. We were able to request interviews with any ‘key stakeholders’ including
Fujitsu personnel, as long as these were pre-agreed and approved by the POL

Legal Team.

96. I did not personally go on site at Fujitsu to conduct the interviews that have

been described. Members of my team undertook those interviews.

97. Question 10 of the Request relates to an email (and associated
attachments) (POL00117519) that was sent to me by Rodric Willams on 2

April 2014. I accept from reading the email that there was a call with him on that

Page 28 of 39
WITNO09750100
WITNO9750100

date. As the following paragraphs hopefully make clear, there was plainly an
ongoing conversation, primarily with Rodric Williams, which ultimately led to the
production of our Engagement Letter on 9 April but my ability to recollect the
contents of individual discussions is limited by the passage of time beyond what is

recorded in the emails.

98. I am also asked to comment on whether POL's instructions would
enable Deloitte to provide a piece of work that provided any or any reasonable
assurance as to the integrity of the Horizon IT System. As outlined in our 2012
Project Zebra proposal, (POL00116802) I was of the view that options were
available to POL to carry out detailed work that could provide assurance over the
integrity of HNG-X. Such assurance would have required more detailed work than
was eventually agreed in Part 1 of our Scope, for example testing of implementation
and operating effectiveness, alongside data extraction and analysis and the potential

ultimate application of international standards frameworks such as ISAE3000.

99. In question 11 of the Request, I am asked to comment on a meeting
that I had with Rodric Williams on 3 April 2014, as referenced in two emails
that were sent to me; the first from Rodric Williams on 4 April 2014 (with
associated attachments) (POL00125760) and the second from Belinda Crowe
also on 4 April 2014 (POL00117551). As indicated in paragraph 97, I know
that the various discussions took place in the week leading up to the
production of our Engagement Letter but my recollection of discussions in

specific meetings is now limited.

100. The same is, I regret, true in relation to Question 12 which refers to an

email exchange between Belinda Crowe and me on 7 April 2014

Page 29 of 39
WITNO09750100
WITNO9750100

(POLO0108407) and asks for my recollection of the discussions referred to in

that exchange.

101. Finally, an email from Gareth Jenkins to me and others on 10 April
2014 (POL00100514) is referenced in question 15. I am asked for my
recollection of the purpose of the meeting referred to in that email. I apologise
but I simply cannot now recall the details of what was discussed at this meeting or

its purpose.

102. I have been asked a series of questions under the sub-heading
‘Following the full report.' These questions relate to events that followed after
version 16 of the Deliverable was sent to the POL Legal Team on 23 May
2014. Question 21 of the Request specifically refers to an email chain
between me, Rodric Williams and Chris Aujard from 29 to 30 May 2014 anda
forwarding email from Chris Aujard to the POL Board circulated on 29 May

2024 at 18:25hrs (POL00031400).

103. As discussed at para 62, a new document known as the Board Briefing was
prepared following discussions on 29 May 2014 with the POL Legal Team. Chris
Aujard made it clear he required a shorter document for the Board, focusing on

extracts from our draft Deliverable.

104. Tobeclear, I believe Chris Aujard's email of 29 May 2014 was referring to

version 16 of the Deliverable because there was no other ‘full report’.

105. Ihave not previously seen Chris Aujard's forwarding email to the POL Board.
Reading it now, I do not think that it was fair. The email from Chris Aujard criticising

our delivery indicates there were expectations of the substance of our commentary

Page 30 of 39
WITNO09750100
WITNO9750100

which would not have been possible from the part 1 work alone, particularly
considering it was limited to a desktop review to provide a summary of Third-
Party Assurance Reviews. We were not able to provide the level of assurance
requested by the POL Legal Team before our engagement began and this
would not have been possible regardless in the time available, even if detailed
testing had been instructed. This was made very clear from the outset of our
instruction and is documented in both the Engagement Letter and the

subsequent Change Order, as well as in the Deliverable.

106. The dialogue with POL during the run-up to the Board Meeting and during
May 2014 was exclusively with the POL Legal Team, in particular Chris Aujard and,

to a lesser extent, Rodric Williams.

107. I do recall thinking that certain aspects of the Horizon Features (in particular
relating to the Audit Store) exceeded the level of transactional archive control that
one would usually see in other retail businesses with large numbers of branches,
and I do recall a desire from the POL Legal Team for Deloitte to make succinct
positive statements on this in our Deliverable. This resulted in discussions with the
POL Legal Team regarding key wording that could be used in the Executive

Summary of our Deliverable.

108. It was imperative to Deloitte that extracts should not be taken from our
Deliverable and used without appropriate context, in particular given the points noted
previously relating to our Scope (for example the limitation to HNG-X only) and the

nature of our work (for example the absence of testing)

Page 31 of 39
WITNO09750100
WITNO9750100

109. I do recall feeling pressure at this stage to include particular assurance
wording. I had excellent support from my senior colleagues in Deloitte, including a
very experienced second review partner, who agreed that the wording we had
included in the draft Deliverable was appropriate and we could not appropriately
go any further. We confirmed to the POL Legal Team that we would be unable to
alter the wording as requested, particularly given the Scope, timing and nature of the

work performed.

110. Question 22 of the Request asks that I consider and set out the
background to an email from myself to Rodric Williams on 4 June 2014
(POL00031408). That date coincides with the date on the Board Briefing, however
I cannot recall the background to this email and I am unable to now say if my email

to Rodric Williams on 4 June was sent after or prior to delivery of the Board Briefing.

111. Adocument entitled 'report to POL Board on Initial Complaints Review
and Mediation Scheme: Sub Committee Recommendation’ (POL00027 153) is
referenced in question 25 of the Request, and I am asked to respond to a

number of queries regarding discussions around this document.

112. For example, did Deloitte state that it would not consent to the release
of its report(s) in accordance with paragraph 5.2 of the report? I do not recall
any discussions with the POL Legal Team about consent to release our Deliverable

outside of the legal advisory teams.

113. With regards to paragraph 5.4 of the report identified in paragraph 111
above, which I am also asked to consider, I do recall a conversation with the

POL Legal Team around whether a ‘backward looking’ review was recommended or

Page 32 of 39
WITNO09750100
WITNO9750100

appropriate. The additional work performed under the Change Order showed that
very little documentation from the Legacy System remained available (for reasons
stated at paragraph 31 above). Our position on a “backward looking” review was
taken on the basis that there would be no evidence available on which to base more

detailed work and testing.

f) Reasons and motivations behind instructing Deloitte

114. Throughout the Request I have been asked to respond to queries
which go to my understanding as to why POL decided to instruct Deloitte to
undertake the work in Scope. I will seek to answer these queries to the best of

my knowledge in this section of the statement.

115. My understanding of POL's reason for this instruction, raised in question
13a of the Request, which the Engagement Letter was intended to reflect, was to
assist POL in determining whether the ‘Horizon HNG-X system is robust and
operates with integrity, within an appropriate control framework.’ I understood that
this would (i) primarily assist POL in making decisions relating to potential
improvements to its business practices and (ii) inform POL's strategy in relation to
ongoing litigation in respect of the allegations that it was facing, namely that the
Horizon IT system was defective and/or that the processes associated with it were
inadequate (although, as explained above and throughout, our work was confined to
HNG- X and not Legacy). I did not know the specifics of such litigation and cannot

comment further on the next steps identified.

Page 33 of 39
WITNO09750100
WITNO9750100

116. Inrelation to the extract quoted in question 13b of the Request®, I would say
this is standard for a review of the nature agreed and the timetable available,
however it is worth re-iterating that the limited time to finalise the Deliverable was not
typical. This type of desktop assessment approach is a standard method of
commencing a complex assurance requirement which may involve the need for

multiple, agile stages of work.

117. Question 13d of the Request asks that I consider a specific quote from
the Engagement Letter regarding legal privilege’ and relay my understanding
as to how the Deliverable would be used in relation to any ongoing litigation or
potential future litigation. As mentioned above, I did not know the specifics of
the litigation our engagement related to as this was not relevant to the work we
were engaged to undertake. We were asked to perform our work under legal
privilege and to mark our reports appropriately; that was an instruction rather
than a discussion and, given the sensitivities around the Horizon IT system
and the fact we were reporting into the POL Legal Team, the instruction did
not strike me as unusual. As clearly stated in our Engagement Letter, our work

products were not designed to be used as expert evidence.

118. As I have stated at paragraph 23, I do not think that I can provide an
opinion as requested in question 20d of the Request, on the robustness of the
review with regards to (a) management or statutory accounts or (b) prosecutions
or defending litigation.

® "You do not require Deloitte to comment on or test the quality of the assurance work performed, nor opine on either its adequa cy,

sufficiency or conclusions, or the integrity of the Horizon HGN -X processing environment (nor the legacy Horizon
system)”.

7 "You have advised us that all correspondence and all preparatory papers for any report we might make are legally privileged,
as they are being prepared in relation to ongoing litigation and linked to the provision of legal advice "

Page 34 of 39
WITNO09750100
WITNO9750100

g) General

119. In answer to question 29 of the Request, with the benefit of hindsight, I
would have liked more specific information from the POL Legal Team on the
circulation of our Deliverable, albeit in draft form; for example, what versions were

shared with the Board and when.

120. Further work I would have liked to have performed is detailed in our

Deliverable, specifically part 2 testing and implementation.
