2.2 Consideration for Single Point of Contact (SPOC) linked to Rick Griffin

>» The Project Manager will engage with Rick Griffin with regards to SPOC.
Project and how this could be linked to “Whistleblower”

» Project Manager to engage and communicate with Grapevine with regards to
possible links with SPOC and current processes which may already be
embedded at Grapevine which may provide a link to “Whistleblower” type
activity.

2.3 Process options, benchmarking and recommendations

There are a range of possible process options including:-

Single Point Of Contact

Presentation possibilities

Communication Campaign (Posters, Leaflets etc)

Horizon & Fujitsu options

Whistleblower Process Map

Benchmarking against external companies Whistleblower Policies
Process agreement between Stakeholders

VVVVVVV

Once the key activities have been clearly identified the project manager will engage
with all key stakeholders to ensure all possible options have been considered before
the final recommendations are made. This whistle blowing policy will include the
businesses commitment to the highest standards of corporate openness, probity and
accountability and will set out arrangements for all staff to raise concerns about
malpractice or serious wrongdoing in ways which will protect them from reprisal.

2.4 Process launch and implementation

The project manager will be responsible for ensuring that the agreed
recommendations from phase 2.3 above are successfully adopted and implemented

2.5 Post implementation review

Following phase 2.4, above the agreed process which has been implemented will be
monitored and reviewed to assess the effectiveness.

4. Project Finances

Although at this stage the total cost cannot be quantified, there will be costs involved in this
project principally around communications to cascade and deliver the process. There could
also be resource costs around running the process as business as usual once the project
has been completed. It is suggested an estimated budget cost for printing around £10,000
and T&S costs of £5,000 should be allowed for this project.

5. Project Assumptions, Risks and Constraints

A tisk could be that the cost of introducing and maintaining a “Whistleblower” policy may
outweigh any potential benefits.

However if a process is not adopted and introduced then the business would fail to meet
F.S.A. guidelines.
