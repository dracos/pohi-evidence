Case Summary:
Audit Deficiency. Sub-postmaster (Michael Rudkin)
is Chairman of the Negotiating Panel for the
National Federation of Sub-postmasters. Branch is
managed by his wife Susan Rudkin, who has
admitted to the theft of £40k. Mrs Rudkin when
interviewed stated that since February 2007 she
covered losses and paid funds into her bank
account to pay bills.
Mrs Rudkin said that she had let things get out
of control as she was running the private
business, the PO counter and the sorting office
staff (14 postmen). She admitted to taking PO
money and paying into Lloyds Bank business
accounts to meet bills. Also the inflating the
cash to cover up weekly losses in the PO. It was
not possible to establish a firm date when this
started but she says it is since the robbery at
the office some two years ago. Paperwork from
office shows that the figure was around £24k
short in September (20072). Total difference in
cash on audit was £43700. She confirmed that no
staff were aware of what she was doing and her
husband had not worked in the PO for over a year
and he was unaware of the shortage until today as
he played no part in running the office.

The Post OfficeO Network Auditors, led by Paul
Field visited Ibstock Post Office® on Wednesday
20th August 2008 to conduct a verification of
assets audit. er being admitted to the office
the wife of the Postmaster, Mrs Susan RUDKIN
requested a private word with Paul Field. She
then informed him that the safe would be around
£40,000 short.

The office which has 3 HORIZON terminals and
employs 5 part time staff is sited within a
newsagents and general dealers in a rural village
on the outskirts of Leicester. There is also a

Sorting office on the premises which is a base
for 14 postmen.

The office was victim to a robbery in January
2006 and the last risk based audit was undertaken
on 7% December 2006.

Mr Rudkin said that he would allow an interview
to take place on his premises and said that his
wife would cooperate fully with any investigation
and would not require a solicitor.

He handed me a signed admission statement, by Mrs
Rudkin and informed me that at the time, the
discrepancy in the account was £43856:89 which
was mainly due to a shortage in the cash of
£43761:17.

conducted a tape-recorded interview with Susan
RUDKIN in the private residence at Ibstock Post
Officeo.

During the interview Susan Rudkin explained that
her husband was heavily involved in NFSP work and
she felt that the pressure of running the private
business, the Post Office® and the household
finances had gotten too much. She said that the
Post Office had been experiencing losses and she
had been inflating the cash on hand to cover it
up. She also said that she had been taking cash
from the Post Office® and paying it into their
Lloyds bank business account to cover bills. It
was not possible to establish an exact date when
the theft started but she said that she had been
under pressure since the robbery. Susan Rudkin
said that she felt embarrassed to tell her
husband about the situation and felt that she had
let him down. When asked about the cash
declarations she said she that she kept a running
total of the shortages and just added this amount
onto the daily figures. She was adamant that no
one else knew what she was doing and on the
occasions that other staff members declared the
cash she would overwrite the figures. Susan
Rudkin acknowledged that she had stolen the money
from the Post Office® (although the initial
intention was to repay it) and was not at present
able to repay i

Mr & Mrs Rudkin live {I
! GRO around
£450k. There is a £250k mortgage outstanding and
the only other known debt is a card

can be confirmed until the usual financial check
results are received.

Mr Rudkin feels there will be no prosecution when
the money is repaid and he will be reinstated in
post.

25/02/09 I section 18 prepared and forwarded to Jarnail and GH
Mike Wilcox
25/03/09 I Please find attached a section 18 request to be GH

served on the defendant should she plead or be
found guilty in a crown court.

We need to ensure that our agents ask for
confiscation and ask for compensation, and that
they request the compensation be deferred to the

outcome of any future confiscation hearing.

With an outstanding amount for £43,894.15 the
court may " incorrectly" at an early time agree
confiscation and compensation and make an order
at the time of the hearing without waiting for a
financial report (I say incorrectly because this
offence falls into the category of "General
Criminal Conduct" and as such it would be
impossible at this point for the court to agree
the defendant's total benefit from crime). In
this case the section 18 need not be served but

POL00056762
POL00056762
the increase in the value of money from Jan 07
offence start to January 2009 added (this being
the latest figure on hand) and a benefit,
confiscation and compensation figure of

£44, 689.82 should be sought.

If there is any other way I may assist please do
not hesitate to contact me

17/08/09 1. Spoke with Ms Henrietta Paget, she says that GH
there was an undertaking given in court that
there would not be a POCA request for any
figure greater than the loss. She says that
this could be argued in court but that the
outcome would not be certain and that there
could be some criticism of POLTD. She
suggested that I consider our position and
if I should accept this position or go for
the extended benefit figure. She further
stated that there was a significant document
from the defence which had yet to be passed
to me by Jarnail
