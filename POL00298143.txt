As you will see we are asking Richard to do a review on Second Sight which is very sensitive.

To help him could you please gather together the last update paper from the Board plus any other papers on
going (such as Angela's work) and send the over. Better still ping them to me first and I will review and then
you can dispatch. Also we need to get an NDA but let's discuss tomorrow.

Finally can you please drop this note to Angela and cc me so we can make contact electronically

Angela

I'm looking forward to meeting you tomorrow and catching up on the work you have been doing around the
Second Sight review. I was hoping to be able to review the workstreams to get a better understanding on
how we are handling the various issues. If there are any documents by way of background reading which it
would be helpful if I had read in advance then please send them over.

Many thanks

Alasdair

Hi Richard

Can we meet at St Ermins at Queen's Anne's Gate. I've held meetings there before and they have a very good quiet
and private area in the balcony above the reception.

www.sterminshotel.co.uk

I have a meeting at 0900 there and so I will be there before you arrive - again I will be upstairs (probably on
the right) as you arrive into reception. Any problems please contact me on my mobile I
orvm.

I have also attached a draft specification for the review which will give you a broad sense of what we are
trying to achieve. I will fill you in on the background and some thoughts on the approach but this is certainly
an area for discussion. I will also try and gather together other relevant background papers and get them
sent over.

Finally we will need to sign and NDA and I will arrange this to happen - needless to say this work is highly
sensitive.

I look forward to meeting you on Friday at 1030.
Many thanks

Alasdair
