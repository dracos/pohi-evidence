I hope this makes sense. Any questions give me a call. I understand Darrell raised this as the Team Leaders meeting.

Hi Chris,

I'm working an investigators guide. The guide will deal with a few important issues, including evidence handling and
continuity. Rob says you've worked on something. Could you send your ‘stuff’ over to me and I'll see where I can pop it

in the guide.

Cheers
