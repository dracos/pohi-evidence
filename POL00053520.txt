REGINA v SEEMA MISRA
GUILDFORD CROWN COURT
TRIAL ~ 30 NOVEMBER 2009
CASE NO: POLTD/0708/0249

Jon,

I enclose a copy of a letter and request for disclosure received from Issy Hogg. I
also enclose a copy of my fairly brief reply at this stage. Could you please do
your best to obtain the material requested and if it is not available or you could

consider it irrelevant please could you state so and why.

If you are unsure as to any of it please tell me and I will seek advice from
Warwick Tatford of Counsel as to disclosure.

Regards.

Phil Taylor
Legal Executive
Criminal Law Division
