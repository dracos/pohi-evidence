FUJITSU Description

FUJITSU RESTRICTED (COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE)

The Service Management Service has overall governance over the activities of the Third Line Support
Service. If the scope of the Third Line Support Service changed, the Service Management Service may
interface directly with the Application Support Service (Fourth Line).

The Third Line Support Service receives Incidents for investigation from the MAC Team Element of the
Service Management Service. Any changes to the scope of the Third Line Support Service may result in
Incidents being passed to the Application Support Service (Fourth Line).

2.8 Post Office Dependencies and Responsibilities

In addition to the generic responsibilities which shall apply as set out in Schedule AS of the Agreement,
Post Office shall keep each base unit in each Branch switched on at all times unless specifically
requested to do otherwise by Fujitsu Services.

2.9 Business Continuity

This section defines the measures taken to minimise the risk of not being able to provide the Third Line
Support Service and sets out what Fujitsu Services is required to provide in terms of business continuity
specific to the provision of this Third Line Support Service. Details of the Third Line Support Service
Business Continuity Plan are set out in the Working Document entitled: “"HNG-X Support Service
Business Continuity Plan” (SVM/SDM/PLA/0001).

2.9.1. Maintaining Access to Data and Systems

2.9.1.1 Incident Management System

In the event that the Third Line Support Service incident management tool (Peak) becomes unavailable,
failover will occur to a backup system within another Fujitsu Services site.

In the event that the backup system is unavailable, the Third Line Support Service will resort to manual
logging of Incidents until the system is restored and then input manually logged Incidents into the
restored system.

2.9.1.2 Live System Access and Repair Tools

In the event that live systems access and repair tools are unavailable in the primary Third Line Support
Service site, the Third Line Support Service will use suitably configured laptops and support the system
from home addresses.

2.9.1.3 Failover Timescale

Fujitsu Services shall ensure access to live systems access and repair tools via the laptop solution within
three (3) hours of the initial failure.

In the event of a long term failure (expected to last more than 24 hours) Fujitsu Services may choose to
setup 3" line support services at a suitable alternate site.

2.9.1.4 Testing

Fujitsu Services will carry out one (1) walkthrough and one (1) operational test per year covering the
Incident Management System, live system access and repair tools, subject to agreeing the actual dates
for such tests with Post Office, such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld. Such tests shall be
carried out in accordance with the Working Document entitled: “HNG-X Business Continuity Test Plan”
(SVM/SDM/PLA/0003).
