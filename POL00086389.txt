Transfer Pack

Judy Balderson and I have been working with the Agent Application Processing Team (AAPT) to
update the Transfer Pack. As you know many of the documents in the different packs were
duplicated across the packs, with the exception of the SERV135, which was an extract from the
relevant contract. The SERV135 document has now been made obsolete and we have agreed
with AAPT that one pack covering all branch models would be more user-friendly.

As a result we have created just one Transfer Pack which includes the appropriate number of
copies of all the necessary documents/forms and is applicable for all branch models.

Please note that the pack now contains 3 copies of the Acknowledgement of Appointment, as two
copies need to be returned to the AAPT in Leeds. This information has been updated on the
Agent Recruitment page.

The new pack has been added to EASE so please ensure you print a copy and destroy any
previous versions.
