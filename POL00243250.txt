Subject: Draft Letter of Response [BD-4A.FID26859284]

Attachments: _DOC_33380020(1)_DRAFT Letter of Response 16 July 2016.DOCX; _DOC_33379819(1)_LOR Review.XLSX

All
Please find attached the draft Letter of Response (LOR).

The LOR is substantially ready for your review, save for two sections that will be addressed later: Remote Access (as per
our discussion at the SG meeting) and GLO (which is the subject of ongoing correspondence with Freeths).

Your comments are welcomed on all of the LOR but may I ask that, as a minimum, you review the sections marked for
your attention in the attached spreadsheet.

I should be grateful if you could provide your amendments / comments by close of business on Tuesday 19 July 2016
before our next Steering Group meeting on 20 July 2016. If possible, please could you send through comments /
amendments by way of track changes to the letter.

In order to preserve legal privilege, please do not circulate the draft LOR to anyone else. You may discuss it with
colleagues if necessary to do so but if you need to forward it to someone else for input, please can you speak to Rodric or
me first.

Kind regards
Andy
