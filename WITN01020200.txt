            I, Paula Anne Vennells, will say as follows:




            1. 1 make this second witness statement in response to the Notice dated 28 March

                2024 issued by the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry (the "Inquiry") pursuant to

                Section 21 of the Inquiries Act 2005 (the "Section 21 Notice") in relation to my

                appearance before the Business, Innovation and Skills ("BIS") Select Committee

                of the House of Commons on 3 February 2015.

            3. On 3 February 2015, I appeared and gave evidence before the House of Commons

                BIS Select Committee.



            4. A transcript of this evidence is available at (UKO100003229).



            5. The Inquiry team has set out a number of statements in paragraphs 1.1 to 1.15 of

                the Annex to the Section 21 Notice and asked me to set Out, as at 10:00 on 3

                 February 2015, (a) which of them I believed to be true, (b) which (if any) I believed

                to be false and (c) which (if any) I neither believed were true nor false for want of




            6. 1 note that some of the statements are lifted verbatim from my evidence to BIS on

                3 February 2015, some are paraphrased, and some do not reflect the totality or

                context of what I said. The statement at paragraph 1.13 is taken from a reply given

                by Angela Van Den Bogerd to the BIS Select Committee and is not a statement




            7. After 15 January 2015, when the request was made that Post Office Limited

                ("POL") attends to give evidence, various briefing documents' were put together


              These documents included documents, many of which are updated versions of one another, named
            or headed: Draft briefing document attached to emai l (POL00219704); Draft Qs and As

                for me and various preparatory sessions were held.



            8. Much of my understanding of the up•-to--date position as at 10:00 on 3 February

                2015 was drawn from briefing documents that I was provided with on Friday 30

                January 2015, which had been put together by members of the senior management

                team.



            9. Updated versions of ten documents 2 were provided by email at 17:59 on 2

                 February 2015 (POL00168307) and I recall having at least some of these in hard

                copy when giving evidence and immediately beforehand.

            Paragraph 1.2: The reason for the applications to the Mediation Scheme taking loner

            to progress than POL would have liked was because it had investigated every single

            11.As at 10:00 on 3 February 2015, I believed it to be true that the reason for the

                applications to the Mediation Scheme taking longer to progress than POL would

                 have liked was because POL had investigated every single case and Second Sight

                and the Working Group were completing their part of the process, all in the most

                thorough detail. The reasons for my belief are set out in detail in my first witness

                statement dated 8 March 2024 (WfTN01020100), particularly (but not exclusively)

                 in paragraphs 756, 786, 787, 791 and 807.

            Sight with all of the documents it had requested that were pertinent to resolvi

            applicants' cases.



            13. As at 10:00 on 3 February 2015, I believed it to be true that POL had, where it was



                requested that were pertinent to resolving applicants' cases.



            Paragraph 1.5: When requested, POL had provided Second Sight with whatever

            information was appropriate on every single applicant in the Mediation Scheme.

            14.As at 10:00 on 3 February 2015, 1 believed it to be true that, when requested, POL

                had provided Second Sight with whatever information was appropriate on every

                single applicant in the Mediation Scheme.



            Paragraph 1.6: Where a POL investigation into an application to the Mediation

            Scheme had identified an IT issue. POL had looked into those issues and taken advice

            on them from internal IT experts.



            15.As at 10:00 on 3 February 2015, I believed it to be true that that where a POL

                investigation into an application to the Mediation Scheme had identified an IT issue,

                 POL had looked into those issues and taken the right advice from our IT experts in

                the business. To expand upon this, I spoke frequently with Lesley Sewell, POL's

                Chief Information Officer, who reassured me that POL had liaised with Fujitsu when

                it was investigating the IT issues in the Mediation Scheme.



            Paraaraph 1.7: The satisfaction rate of SPMs for the suDr)ort desk was around 87%.



            16. As at 10:00 on 3 February 2015, I believed it to be true that the satisfaction rate of

                SPMs for the support desk was around 87%. I had been provided with a vast

                quantity of briefing material prior to the BIS Select Committee hearing and I can

                only assume that that percentage was a figure that I had been given by my team.



            Paragraph 1.8: The satisfaction rate of SPMs for the support desk had improved

            17. As at 10:00 on 3 February 2015, I believed it to be true that the satisfaction rate of

                SPMs for the support desk had improved following changes introduced in 2013 but

                had always been good. I assume that this statement was based on material that I

                had been given by my team, as I would not have known this independently.



            Paracraoh 1.9: POL had found no evidence of any miscarriages of iustice in relation

            to prosecutions of SPMs for theft, false accounting or offences under the Fraud Act




            18.As at 10:00 on 3 February 2015, I believed it to be true that POL had found no

                evidence of any miscarriages of justice. My understanding was that a review of

                criminal cases had been undertaken by external lawyers and that disclosure had

            19.The information provided to me was that there was no reason to believe that any

                conviction of an SPM was unsafe. For example, see an email from David Oliver to

                me on 27 January 2014 (POL00301554). I was informed that we were continuing

                to keep the matters under review. I can see from an email dated 19 March 2014,

                from David Oliver to Sophie Bialaszewski that, during the course of a meeting with

                David, I had specifically asked whether there were any unsafe convictions (see

                page 2 of (POL00303098)).



            20.The information provided to me for my January 2015 CEO report was that POL had

                now completed investigations for all cases in the Mediation Scheme. As at that

                date we had found no evidence of faults with the Horizon system or unsafe

                convictions, nor had any been provided by any applicant or Second Sight. We were

                not aware that any convictions had been appealed. A copy of my January 2015

                CEO report is contained in the Board pack for the 28 January 2015 Board Meeting

                (see page 6 of (POL00027422)).



            21. 1 was aware that POL had received a letter from the CCRC asking for information

                on the criminal cases involved in Sparrow and that the business had 28 days to

                respond (see page 9 of (POL00311444)).



            Paragraph 1.10: POL had found no evidence to suggest that the criminal conviction of

            an applicant to the Mediation Scheme was unsafe.



            22.As at 10:00 on 3 February 2015, 1 believed it to be true that POL had found no

                evidence to suggest that the criminal conviction of an applicant to the Mediation

                Scheme was unsafe. My belief was based on the material provided to me in

                advance of the BIS Select Committee hearing, set out at paragraphs 7 to 9 above.



            Paragraph 1.11: POL had completed all of its investigation reports for the applications

            in the Mediation Scheme.



            23.As at 10:00 on 3 February 2015, I believed it to be true that POL had completed all

                of its investigation reports for the applications in the Mediation Scheme. My belief

            Paragraph 1.12: As soon as the Mediation Scheme started, POL made sure that it did

            not destroy any data related to it at all.



            24.As at 10:00 on 3 February 2015, 1 believed it to be true that as soon as the

                Mediation Scheme started, POL made sure that it did not destroy any data related

                to it at all. My understanding was based on conversations with colleagues in the

                legal team and briefing notes prepared for me.



            Paragraph 1.13: Every application to the mediation scheme was considered by POL

            on its own merits, including those involving a criminal conviction, whether or not an

            individual had pleaded guilty.



            25. 1 believed it to be true that every application to the Mediation Scheme was

                considered by POL on its own merits, including those involving a criminal

                conviction, whether or not an individual had pleaded guilty. There would be rigorous

                examination by the Post Office team, which would be reviewed by Second Sight,

                and lawyers would be involved in that process. However, we had had strong legal

                advice that it would be unwise to try and finally resolve cases with criminal

                convictions by mediation, even though they had been admitted to the Scheme,

                because they could not be resolved by mediation. For all cases, if anything came

                up in the review process that threw new light onto the prosecution process, that

                information would be disclosed. We would offer individual face-to-face meetings

                with the SPM and potentially with their MP. My belief was based on the material

                provided to me in advance of the BIS Select Committee hearing, set out at

                paragraphs 7 to 9 above.

            Paragraph 1.14: POL had found no evidence that suggested that Horizon was not

            working as it should be during its two-and--a-half-year investigation.



            26.As at 10:00 on 3 February 2015, 1 believed it to be true that POL had found no

                evidence that suggested that Horizon was not working as it should be during its

                two-and-a-half-year investigation. My up-to-date understanding of the position was

                largely based on the material provided to me in advance of the BIS Select

                Committee hearing, set out at paragraphs 7 to 9 above. For example, see

                (POL00026704) at page 7, paragraph 24 and (POL00026702) at page 3,

                paragraph 17. l was aware that several members of the Sparrow team had had

                input into the briefing documents provided to me.



            Paragraph 1.15: There was no functionality in Horizon for either branches, POL or

            branch's accounts.



            27.As at 10:00 on 3 February 2015, I believed it to be true that there was no

                functionality in Horizon for either branches, POL or Fujitsu to edit, manipulate or

                remove transaction data once it had been recorded in a branch's accounts. My

                belief was based on the material provided to me in advance of the Select

                Committee hearing, set out at paragraphs 7 to 9 above. In particular, see

                (P0L00026699; P0L00029809).

            Paragraoh 2: As at 3 February 2015. did you continue to have confidence in the

            Horizon IT System?



            28.As at 10:00 on 3 February 2015, 1 continued to have confidence in the Horizon IT

                system.



            Paragraph 3: 3 February 2015



            29. 1 am asked in paragraph 3 of the Annex to the Section 21 Notice whether, before

                10:00 on 3 February 2015, 1 was aware of the matters set out in paragraphs 3.1

                and 3.2.



            Paragraph 3.1: That Second Sight claimed (a) to have asked POL to provide emails

            sent in 2008 relevant to an incident it was investigating at a Fujitsu office in Bracknell




            30. 1 recall that at some point in 2013, I was aware that Second Sight had asked POL

                for emails relevant to an incident it had been investigating at a Fujitsu office in

                Bracknell. The team had told me that they had been asked for an enormous amount

                of data which required a massive data mining task which needed to be narrowed

                down. I was not aware that POL had sent 2009 emails instead of 2008 emails. 1

                was aware on a general level that there were issues over emails, but not the

                specificity of what is set out in paragraph 3.1 above. I did not know that the issues

                relating to the provision of emails had not been resolved by 2015.

            Paraaraoh 3.2: That Second Siaht claimed (a) to have reauested full access to

            prosecution files and (b) that POL had denied it had such access.



            31. I can see that I was copied into an email sent by Ian Henderson to Chris Aujard on

                16 January 2015 (POL00102005) in which he stated "...POL...so far has not

                provided the information requested on a number of critical matters, including the

                Bracknell emails, prosecution documents and full details of transactions relating to

                the Suspense account". I cannot recall receiving this email, but I note that it raised

                a number of different issues.



            32. 1 was not copied into the reply by Chris Aujard, nor into further emails relating to

                this issue. I note that on 22 January 2015, Belinda Crowe forwarded to the Sparrow

                team and others, Ian Henderson's email of 16 January, Chris Aujard's response of

                21 January and Ian Henderson's further reply of 21 January (POL00109904).

                Belinda said that she had "alerted Paula to the fact that this is in existence and

                relevant to the Select Committee. She [Paula] has asked specifically that we have

                answers to these questions. / assured her we would — Rod will be able to provide

                answers to these questions. ".



            33. It appears from the email above that I sought further information to answer the

                questions in the 16 January email which I assume I would have asked for having

                been made aware of the issues. I do not recall receiving any further detailed

                information on these points and my briefing pack did not contain material on the

                prosecution files issue.

            34. 1 recall when I gave my evidence to the BIS Select Committee that what Ian

                Henderson was saying about access to prosecution files was new to me. i had not

                understood from the legal team what a prosecution file was, that access had

                previously been provided to this material or whether or not that access had been

                stopped. I felt under enormous pressure and was completely wrong footed by the

                exchanges before the BIS Select Committee and I did not want to say anything on

                an issue about which I did not have a complete understanding. At the same time, I

                did not want to commit to something which was clearly a legal matter, on which I

                was not qualified to make a decision. I wanted to go away and make further

                enquiries so I could give an informed response to the Committee.



            Paragraoh 4: 24 June 2020



            35.The Inquiry team has set out a number of statements in paragraphs 4.1 to 4.32 of

                the Annex to the Section 21 Notice and asked me to set out, as at 24 June 2020,

                (a) which of them I believed to be true, (b) which (if any) I believed to be false and

                (c) which (if any) I neither believed were true nor false for want of knowledge. I

                note that some of the statements are lifted verbatim from my letter to BEIS dated

                24 June 2020, some are paraphrased, and some do not reflect the totality or

                context of what I said in the letter.

                 I could remember in dealing with complaints about the Horizon IT System prior to

                becoming managing director of POL. See for example paragraphs 36 to 39 of my

                witness statement dated 8 March 2024 (WWITN01020100) for roles and

                responsibilities in relation to dealing with complaints.



            Paragraph 4.2: You had no responsibility for investigators or prosecutors prior to

            becoming managing director of POL.

            System in about mid-2012.



            38.As at 24 June 2020, I believed it to be true that I began engaging with SPMs'

                concerns regarding the Horizon IT system in about mid -2012.



            39. 1 have seen from disclosure that I was copied in on documents referring to SPMs'

                complaints about Horizon during 2010 and 2011 which I do not now recall, nor did

                 I when I sent my responses to BEIS on 24 June 2020. The chronology of my

                engagement with SPMs' concerns is set out in detail in my witness statement dated

                8 March 2024 (WWITN01020100). Some non-exhaustive examples of this are in

                 paragraphs 196 and 1270, of that statement.

                 identifying specific areas within POL where there was need for improvement.

                 For completeness, I should have made clear that for E&Y to conduct more in-depth

                audits using the SAS70 model, Fujitsu needed to put in place reporting systems

                which could respond to the SAS70 approach.

            56.As at 24 June 2020, 1 believed it to be true that E&Y had noted improvements to

                 recommendations for further improvements.

                 issues raised in previous years' audits.

            Paragraph 4.23: In or around March 2015. the POL board sub-committee decided not

            to give Second Sight access to POL's internal prosecution files that were subject to

            59. As at 24 June 2020, 1 believed it to be true that in or around March 2015, the POL

                 board sub-committee decided not to give Second Sight access to POL's internal

                 prosecution files that were subject to legal professional privilege. I am no longer

                able to recall why, in June 2020, I believed that it was the POL board sub-

                committee which made this decision.

            CEO of Fuiitsu. who said the Horizon IT System was 'like Fort Knox".



            60. As at 24 June 2020, I believed it to be true that I had previously raised the issue of

                 remote access with the then CEO of Fujitsu, who had said that the Horizon IT

                System was "like Fort Knox": see paragraphs 1299 and 1796 of my witness




            Paragraph 4.25: When you were CEO of POL, you were told by Fujitsu that it was not

            Paragraph 4.27: You only became aware that the information Fujitsu had provided to

            you on remote access was seriously inaccurate after you had left POL.



            61. As at 24 June 2020, in paragraphs 54 and 55 of my letter to BEIS, I was responding

                to a question (14) about my knowledge in 2015 of whether SPMs' transactions

                could be accessed and altered centrally without their knowledge. I believed that

                answer to be true. The question related to the evidence that I gave to the BIS Select

                Committee in 2015. I had wanted to give an answer to the 2015 BIS Select

                Committee that was direct and factually accurate and had raised this question

                 repeatedly both internally and with Fujitsu. I had always been given the same

                answer: that it was not possible for branch records to be altered remotely without

                the SPMs knowledge. My belief was also based on the material provided to me in

                advance of the BIS Select Committee hearing in February 2015, as set out at

                 paragraphs 7 to 9 above.



            62.As I said in paragraph 55 of my letter of 24 June 2020, I only became aware from

                the judgment of Fraser J in the Horizon Issues litigation (see paragraphs 525 to

                527 (POL00022840)), that the information that I had been given about remote

                access in 2015 was seriously inaccurate.



            63. l would like to refer to paragraphs 1267 to 1443 of my first witness statement dated

                8 March 2024 (WITNO1020100) for a fuller explanation of my understanding of

                 remote access while I was CEO of POL.
