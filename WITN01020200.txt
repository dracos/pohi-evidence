Evidence before House of Commons BIS Select Committee on 3 February 2015

3. On 3 February 2015, | appeared and gave evidence before the House of Commons

BIS Select Committee.

4. A transcript of this evidence is available at (UKGI00003229).

5. The Inquiry team has set out a number of statements in paragraphs 1.1 to 1.15 of
the Annex to the Section 21 Notice and asked me to set out, as at 10:00 on 3
February 2015, (a) which of them | believed to be true, (b) which (if any) | believed
to be false and (c) which (if any) | neither believed were true nor false for want of

knowledge.

6. | note that some of the statements are lifted verbatim from my evidence to BIS on
3 February 2015, some are paraphrased, and some do not reflect the totality or
context of what | said. The statement at paragraph 1.13 is taken from a reply given
by Angela Van Den Bogerd to the BIS Select Committee and is not a statement

that | made.

7. After 15 January 2015, when the request was made that Post Office Limited

(“POL”) attends to give evidence, various briefing documents‘ were put together

1 These documents included documents, many of which are updated versions of one another, named
or headed: Draft briefing document attached to email (POL00219704); Draft Qs and As
(POL00102073); Suggested core narrative (POL00026697); Draft opening statement (POL00117061);

for me and various preparatory sessions were held.

8. Much of my understanding of the up-to-date position as at 10:00 on 3 February
2015 was drawn from briefing documents that | was provided with on Friday 30
January 2015, which had been put together by members of the senior management

team.

9. Updated versions of ten documents? were provided by email at 17:59 on 2

February 2015 (POL00168307) and | recall having at least some of these in hard

copy when giving evidence and immediately beforehand.

Paragraph 1.1: Applications to the Initial Complaint Review and Mediation Scheme

(the "Mediation Scheme") had taken longer to progress than you would have liked.

10.As at 10:00 on 3 February 2015, | believed it to be true that the applications to the

Mediation Scheme had taken longer to progress than POL would have liked.

Paragraph 1.2: The reason for the applications to the Mediation Scheme taking longer

to progress than POL would have liked was because it had investigated every single

case in the most thorough detail.

2 The ten attachments were named: NARRATIVE BOXES finalised (POL00029809); Core narrative
(POL00026697); Key facts SC (POL00026698); B/S select committee Qs and As 1549

11.As at 10:00 on 3 February 2015, | believed it to be true that the reason for the
applications to the Mediation Scheme taking longer to progress than POL would
have liked was because POL had investigated every single case and Second Sight
and the Working Group were completing their part of the process, all in the most
thorough detail. The reasons for my belief are set out in detail in my first witness
statement dated 8 March 2024 (WITN01020100), particularly (but not exclusively)

in paragraphs 756, 786, 787, 791 and 807.

Paragraph 1.3: The investigation by POL of applications to the Mediation Scheme had

been rigorous.

12.As at 10:00 on 3 February 2015, | believed it to be true that the investigation by

POL of applications to the Mediation Scheme had been rigorous.

Paragraph 1.4: POL had, where it was able and possible to do so, provided Second

Sight with all of the documents it had requested that were pertinent to resolving

applicants’ cases.

13.As at 10:00 on 3 February 2015, | believed it to be true that POL had, where it was

able and possible to do so, provided Second Sight with all of the documents it had

requested that were pertinent to resolving applicants’ cases.

Paragraph 1.5: When requested, POL had provided Second Sight with whatever

information was appropriate on every single applicant in the Mediation Scheme.

14.As at 10:00 on 3 February 2015, | believed it to be true that, when requested, POL
had provided Second Sight with whatever information was appropriate on every

single applicant in the Mediation Scheme.

Paragraph 1.6: Where a POL investigation into an application to the Mediation

Scheme had identified an IT issue, POL had looked into those issues and taken advice

on them from internal IT experts.

15.As at 10:00 on 3 February 2015, | believed it to be true that that where a POL
investigation into an application to the Mediation Scheme had identified an IT issue,
POL had looked into those issues and taken the right advice from our IT experts in
the business. To expand upon this, | spoke frequently with Lesley Sewell, POL's
Chief Information Officer, who reassured me that POL had liaised with Fujitsu when

it was investigating the IT issues in the Mediation Scheme.

Paragraph 1.7: The satisfaction rate of SPMs for the support desk was around 87%.

16.As at 10:00 on 3 February 2015, | believed it to be true that the satisfaction rate of
SPMs for the support desk was around 87%. | had been provided with a vast
quantity of briefing material prior to the BIS Select Committee hearing and | can

only assume that that percentage was a figure that | had been given by my team.

Paragraph 1.8: The satisfaction rate of SPMs for the support desk had improved

following changes introduced in 2013 but had always been good.

17.As at 10:00 on 3 February 2015, | believed it to be true that the satisfaction rate of
SPMs for the support desk had improved following changes introduced in 2013 but
had always been good. | assume that this statement was based on material that |

had been given by my team, as | would not have known this independently.

Paragraph 1.9: POL had found no evidence of any miscarriages of justice in relation

to prosecutions of SPMs for theft, false accounting or offences under the Fraud Act

2006.

18.As at 10:00 on 3 February 2015, | believed it to be true that POL had found no
evidence of any miscarriages of justice. My understanding was that a review of
criminal cases had been undertaken by external lawyers and that disclosure had

been made to SPMs where appropriate.

19.The information provided to me was that there was no reason to believe that any
conviction of an SPM was unsafe. For example, see an email from David Oliver to
me on 27 January 2014 (POL00301554). | was informed that we were continuing
to keep the matters under review. | can see from an email dated 19 March 2014,
from David Oliver to Sophie Bialaszewski that, during the course of a meeting with
David, | had specifically asked whether there were any unsafe convictions (see

page 2 of (POL00303098)).

20. The information provided to me for my January 2015 CEO report was that POL had
now completed investigations for all cases in the Mediation Scheme. As at that

date we had found no evidence of faults with the Horizon system or unsafe

convictions, nor had any been provided by any applicant or Second Sight. We were
not aware that any convictions had been appealed. A copy of my January 2015
CEO report is contained in the Board pack for the 28 January 2015 Board Meeting

(see page 6 of (POL00027422)).
21.1 was aware that POL had received a letter from the CCRC asking for information
on the criminal cases involved in Sparrow and that the business had 28 days to

respond (see page 9 of (POL00311444)).

Paragraph 1.10: POL had found no evidence to suggest that the criminal conviction of

an applicant to the Mediation Scheme was unsafe.

22.As at 10:00 on 3 February 2015, | believed it to be true that POL had found no
evidence to suggest that the criminal conviction of an applicant to the Mediation
Scheme was unsafe. My belief was based on the material provided to me in

advance of the BIS Select Committee hearing, set out at paragraphs 7 to 9 above.

Paragraph 1.11: POL had completed all of its investigation reports for the applications

in the Mediation Scheme.

23.As at 10:00 on 3 February 2015, | believed it to be true that POL had completed all
of its investigation reports for the applications in the Mediation Scheme. My belief
was based on the material provided to me in advance of the BIS Select Committee

hearing, set out at paragraphs 7 to 9 above.

Paragraph 1.12: As soon as the Mediation Scheme started, POL made sure that it did

not destroy any data related to it at all.

24.As at 10:00 on 3 February 2015, | believed it to be true that as soon as the
Mediation Scheme started, POL made sure that it did not destroy any data related
to it at all. My understanding was based on conversations with colleagues in the

legal team and briefing notes prepared for me.

Paragraph 1.13: Every application to the mediation scheme was considered by POL

on its own merits, including those involving a criminal conviction, whether or not_an

individual had pleaded guilty.

25.1 believed it to be true that every application to the Mediation Scheme was
considered by POL on its own merits, including those involving a criminal
conviction, whether or not an individual had pleaded guilty. There would be rigorous
examination by the Post Office team, which would be reviewed by Second Sight,
and lawyers would be involved in that process. However, we had had strong legal
advice that it would be unwise to try and finally resolve cases with criminal
convictions by mediation, even though they had been admitted to the Scheme,
because they could not be resolved by mediation. For all cases, if anything came
up in the review process that threw new light onto the prosecution process, that
information would be disclosed. We would offer individual face-to-face meetings
with the SPM and potentially with their MP. My belief was based on the material
provided to me in advance of the BIS Select Committee hearing, set out at

paragraphs 7 to 9 above.

Paragraph 1.14: POL had found no evidence that suggested that Horizon was not

working as it should be during its two-and-a-half-year investigation.

26.As at 10:00 on 3 February 2015, | believed it to be true that POL had found no
evidence that suggested that Horizon was not working as it should be during its
two-and-a-half-year investigation. My up-to-date understanding of the position was
largely based on the material provided to me in advance of the BIS Select
Committee hearing, set out at paragraphs 7 to 9 above. For example, see
(POL00026704) at page 7, paragraph 24 and (POL00026702) at page 3,
paragraph 17. | was aware that several members of the Sparrow team had had

input into the briefing documents provided to me.

Paragraph 1.15: There was no functionality in Horizon for either branches, POL or

Fujitsu to edit, manipulate or remove transaction data once it had been recorded in

branch’s accounts.

27.As at 10:00 on 3 February 2015, | believed it to be true that there was no
functionality in Horizon for either branches, POL or Fujitsu to edit, manipulate or
remove transaction data once it had been recorded in a branch’s accounts. My
belief was based on the material provided to me in advance of the Select
Committee hearing, set out at paragraphs 7 to 9 above. In particular, see

(POL00026699; POL00029809).

Paragraph 2: As at 3 February 2015, did you continue to have confidence in the

Horizon IT System?

28.As at 10:00 on 3 February 2015, | continued to have confidence in the Horizon IT

System.

Paragraph 3: 3 February 2015

29.1 am asked in paragraph 3 of the Annex to the Section 21 Notice whether, before
10:00 on 3 February 2015, | was aware of the matters set out in paragraphs 3.1

and 3.2.

Paragraph 3.1: That Second Sight claimed (a) to have asked POL to provide emails

sent in 2008 relevant to an incident it was investigating at a Fujitsu office in Bracknell

and (b) that POL had provided some emails sent in 2009 but not 2008.

30.1 recall that at some point in 2013, | was aware that Second Sight had asked POL
for emails relevant to an incident it had been investigating at a Fujitsu office in
Bracknell. The team had told me that they had been asked for an enormous amount
of data which required a massive data mining task which needed to be narrowed
down. | was not aware that POL had sent 2009 emails instead of 2008 emails. |
was aware on a general level that there were issues over emails, but not the
specificity of what is set out in paragraph 3.1 above. | did not know that the issues

relating to the provision of emails had not been resolved by 2015.

Paragraph 3.2: That Second Sight claimed (a) to have requested full access to

prosecution files and (b) that POL had denied it had such access.

31.1 can see that | was copied into an email sent by lan Henderson to Chris Aujard on
16 January 2015 (POL00102005) in which he stated "...POL...so far has not
provided the information requested on a number of critical matters, including the
Bracknell emails, prosecution documents and full details of transactions relating to
the Suspense account". | cannot recall receiving this email, but | note that it raised

a number of different issues.

32.1 was not copied into the reply by Chris Aujard, nor into further emails relating to
this issue. | note that on 22 January 2015, Belinda Crowe forwarded to the Sparrow
team and others, lan Henderson's email of 16 January, Chris Aujard's response of
21 January and lan Henderson's further reply of 21 January (POL00109904).
Belinda said that she had "alerted Paula to the fact that this is in existence and
relevant to the Select Committee. She [Paula] has asked specifically that we have
answers to these questions. | assured her we would — Rod will be able to provide

answers to these questions. ".

33.It appears from the email above that | sought further information to answer the
questions in the 16 January email which | assume | would have asked for having
been made aware of the issues. | do not recall receiving any further detailed
information on these points and my briefing pack did not contain material on the

prosecution files issue.

34.1 recall when | gave my evidence to the BIS Select Committee that what lan
Henderson was saying about access to prosecution files was new to me. | had not
understood from the legal team what a prosecution file was, that access had
previously been provided to this material or whether or not that access had been
stopped. | felt under enormous pressure and was completely wrong footed by the
exchanges before the BIS Select Committee and | did not want to say anything on
an issue about which | did not have a complete understanding. At the same time, |
did not want to commit to something which was clearly a legal matter, on which |
was not qualified to make a decision. | wanted to go away and make further

enquiries so | could give an informed response to the Committee.

Paragraph 4: 24 June 2020

35.The Inquiry team has set out a number of statements in paragraphs 4.1 to 4.32 of
the Annex to the Section 21 Notice and asked me to set out, as at 24 June 2020,
(a) which of them | believed to be true, (b) which (if any) | believed to be false and
(c) which (if any) | neither believed were true nor false for want of knowledge. |
note that some of the statements are lifted verbatim from my letter to BEIS dated
24 June 2020, some are paraphrased, and some do not reflect the totality or

context of what | said in the letter.

Paragraph 4.1: You had no real involvement with dealing with complaints about the

concerns regarding the Horizon IT system in about mid-2012.

39.1 have seen from disclosure that | was copied in on documents referring to SPMs'

complaints about Horizon during 2010 and 2011 which | do not now recall, nor did

| when | sent my responses to BEIS on 24 June 2020. The chronology of my

engagement with SPMs' concerns is set out in detail in my witness statement dated

8 March 2024 (WITN01020100). Some non-exhaustive examples of this are in

paragraphs 196 and 1270, of that statement.

Paragraph 4.19: As a result of the E&Y 2011 audit, Post Office instructed E&Y to

55.As at 24 June 2020, | believed it to be true that as a result of the E&Y 2011 audit,
Post Office had instructed E&Y to conduct more in-depth audits using the SAS70

by the Inquiry, | now realise that this was not a full account of the position in 2011.
For completeness, | should have made clear that for E&Y to conduct more in-depth
audits using the SAS70 model, Fujitsu needed to put in place reporting systems

Paragraph 4.23: In or around March 2015, the POL board sub-committee decided not

to give Second Sight access to POL’s internal prosecution files that were subject to

legal professional privilege.

59.As at 24 June 2020, | believed it to be true that in or around March 2015, the POL
board sub-committee decided not to give Second Sight access to POL's internal
prosecution files that were subject to legal professional privilege. | am no longer
able to recall why, in June 2020, | believed that it was the POL board sub-

Paragraph 4.27: You only became aware that the information Fujitsu had provided to

you on remote access was seriously inaccurate after you had left POL.

61.As at 24 June 2020, in paragraphs 54 and 55 of my letter to BEIS, | was responding
to a question (14) about my knowledge in 2015 of whether SPMs' transactions
could be accessed and altered centrally without their knowledge. | believed that
answer to be true. The question related to the evidence that | gave to the BIS Select
Committee in 2015. | had wanted to give an answer to the 2015 BIS Select
Committee that was direct and factually accurate and had raised this question
repeatedly both internally and with Fujitsu. | had always been given the same
answer: that it was not possible for branch records to be altered remotely without
the SPMs' knowledge. My belief was also based on the material provided to me in
advance of the BIS Select Committee hearing in February 2015, as set out at

paragraphs 7 to 9 above.

62.As | said in paragraph 55 of my letter of 24 June 2020, | only became aware from
the judgment of Fraser J in the Horizon Issues litigation (see paragraphs 525 to
527 (POL00022840)), that the information that | had been given about remote

access in 2015 was seriously inaccurate.

63.1 would like to refer to paragraphs 1267 to 1443 of my first witness statement dated

8 March 2024 (WITN01020100) for a fuller explanation of my understanding of

remote access while | was CEO of POL.
