and 5B, MC Rules 1981, r 70)

Statement of Andrew Paul Dunks
Age if under 18 over 18 (If over 18 insert ‘over 18')
This statement (consisting of 2 pages signed by me) is true to the best of my knowledge and

belief and I make it knowing that, if it is tendered in evidence, I shall be liable to prosecution if I
have wilfully stated in it anything which I know to be false or do not believe true.

Dated the 24th day of June __ 2008

I have been employed by Fujitsu Services (Fujitsu), Post Office Account, since 11 March 2002
as an IT Security Analyst where I am involved in IT Security for the Post Office Account. I

have a working knowledge of the computer system known as Horizon, which is a
computerised accounting system used by Post Office Ltd. I am authorised by Fujitsu to
undertake extractions of audit data held on the Horizon system and to obtain information
regarding system transaction information processed on the Horizon system.

I make this Witness Statement from facts within my own knowledge unless otherwise stated.
Any records to which I refer in my statement form part of the records relating to the business
of Fujitsu. These were compiled during the ordinary course of business from information
supplied by persons who have or may reasonably be supposed to have personal knowledge of
the matter dealt with in the information supplied, but are unlikely to have any recollection of
the information or cannot be traced, since the nature of the helpdesk involves many engineers
all at differing levels and any number could be involved in a particular call. As part of my
duties, I have access to these records, but I was not involved with any of the technical aspects
of these calls. This area is not my particular area of expertise and I make this witness
statement simply to help clarify the call logs for the benefit of the Court.

An important element of the support provided to sub-postmasters and Counter Clerks is the

Continuation of statement of Andy Dunks

Horizon System Helpdesk (HSH). The HSH is the Horizon user's first ‘port of call’ in the event
of their experiencing a problem with the Horizon system or requiring advice and guidance. If
the system were to malfunction, upon discovery the Horizon users (i.e. the sub-postmaster or
counter clerk) would raise a call to the HSH seeking clarification or advice. HSH is a service
run by Fujitsu Services for the Post Office. I have been asked to provide information pertaining
the working condition of the Horizon system. The following information constitutes the calls
logged by HSH recorded during the period June 30th 2005 to January 14th 2008 for the West
Byfleet Post Office - Branch Code 126023.

I have reviewed the HSH calls pertaining to the West Byfleet branch during the period June
30th 2005 to January 14th 2008. There were 107 calls from branch Code 126023 to the HSH,
this equates to between 3 and 4 calls a month which is average for this size Post Office. All

the calls are of a routine nature and do not fall outside the normal working parameters of the

system or would affect the working order of the counters.
