1.0 INTRODUCTION

1.1 SCOPE

The Agreement defines a Release to be a documented collection of software and/or
data provided by the CONTRACTOR to deliver a Service.

This document describes the planned contents for the Core System Release (CSR).

1.2 OVERVIEW

The Releases identified as Pathway Release 1e and Pathway Release 2 no longer
exist and have effectively been withdrawn. New Release 2 [4] was created by ICL
Pathway in their place, in order to establish a Release based on what was previously
Release 1e and re-prioritised elements of what was Release 2. The changes brought
about by the outcome of the Treasury Review, which requires exclusion of DSS
related functionality and services, has given rise to this release which is known as
the Core Systems Release (CSR).

Any reference to the previous contract (PFI) will need to be interpreted in line with
the revised contract which is a Public Private Partnership (PPP)contract.

Functionality will be delivered to provide:

EPOSS

OBCS

APS (covering magnetic stripe card and bar coded bills)

the technical and security infrastructure to support the above services

a method by which ICL Pathway’s central systems will link directly to Host APS
(HAPS), TIP and POCL Reference Data System (RDS).
