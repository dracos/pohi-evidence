Dear Alan
Cash Account Loss £1041.86
Ihave received correspondence from the Management Information Support Duty
in Birmingham advising me that they now require repayment for the loss of
£1041.86 currently held in Table 2a of your Cash Account.
Unfortunately neither the visits from Selwyn Berry and Ki Barnes nor the pension
& allowance checks carried out for the problematic weeks, revealed specific

reasons as to how the resultant loss of £1041.86 initially occurred.

I would therefore appreciate if, as a matter of some urgency, you could advise me
of your proposals to now make good the loss.

Yours sincerely.

Losses and Gains
Dear Alan,

Further to our conversation, you confirmed that you have been rolling over losses and
gains for the past two years or more. I was unaware of this practice taking place at Craig
Y Don and acknowledge your comment that you wrote to the Post Office regarding
Horizon, losses and gains over two years age, and that to date you have not received any
reply or ‘acknowledgment.

I am now instructing you, that with immediate effect, your are required to make good the
outstanding loss and to cease with this current practice of rolling over any losses and
gains.

Please be advised that Subpostmasters are responsible for all lossés cdused through
their own-negligence, carelessness or error and also for losses of all kinds caused by their
assistants. Deficiencies due to such losses must be made good without delay. With regard
to gains, surpluses may be withdrawn provided that any subsequent charge up to the
amount withdrawn is made good immediately.

Thank you

Yours sincerely ~

Dear Mr Bates,

RE: LOSSES AND GAINS

Thank you for your letter of the 16 Apri! 2003, the content of which has been noted.

Nevertheless, I must point out that you are Bound by the Terms and Conditions of your

Coniract for Services, which was acknowledged by you on the 31 March 2003, when

accepting your appointment.

To this effect you are charged with ensuring that all accounts entrusted to you are kept

in the form prescribed by Post Office Ltd, by using the approved accounting system i.e

Horizon, and therefore, in the event of any losses occurring these should be made good
e without delay (Section 12, paragraph 4, Section 12, paragraph 12 refers).

Accordingly, failure to comply with these obligations can be construed as a Breach of
Contract, which could ultimately put your Contract for Services ‘at risk’.

Reference: Losses and Gains
Dear Mr Wakley

With regard to your letter dated 2 May 2003, I presume the Terms and Conditions of my Contract
of Service you refer to are those I acknowledged on the 31 March 1998 and not 31 March 2003 as
stated in your letter.

You refer me-to section 12 of that contract “The Subpostmaster is responsible for all losses caused
through his own negligence, carelessness or error, and also for losses of all kinds caused by his
Assistants. Deficiencies due to such losses must be made good without delay.” You rightly point
out that I have agreed these terms and I can confirm I would gladly make good any losses caused in

these manners, But I can see nothing in this clause which states that I am also liable for data 1am
unable to check. °

Taken to an extreme, if the Horizon system said I owed £1,000,000 you would say I would have to
make good the loss without delay and without question.

There is no way I will agree to be held responsible for data I have input until such time as I am able
to access the data that I am being asked to be responsible for. In trying to state that I have
acknowledged such things in the Terms and-Conditions of my Contract of Service you are in effect
purporting to vary this contract.

As we are talking about matters contractual I would also draw your attention to item 4.5, and
reference is also made in item 4.4 of the Conditions of Appointment for Craig Y Don Sub Post Office
included in the Contract of Service. This relates to the National Lottery playstation which was
already installed and operational when we took over the business. The Post Office removed the
machine at the end of January 1999 despite all my protests both written and verbal about the loss of
revenue they were going to cause me, about how it had been part of my business plan revenue
projection, of how we had doubled the turnover of the terminal in the few months we had been in
office. I presume the Post Office will now be returning the terminal to us and making good the loss
of income we have incurred during the period we were without the terminal.

Finally, in respect of an issue I raised with you in my letter dated 3" December 2003, namely
recovering the financial shortfall from the private side of our business due to Post Office Limited’s
actions. Our accounts are currently with the firm of Chartered Accounts we use, who are preparing a
statement on the level of shortcomings we have incurred. It will be significant and we will be
looking to recover that lost income swiftly. In the meantime I would appreciate it if you would

ascertain to whom the correspondence should be directed, in order to minimise the delay in meeting
oGPslaim..Or would it be better to address it to you?

Dear Sir

Re: Craig-y-Don Post Office

We have been instructed by Post Office Ltd in relation to an outstanding debt owed by you to Post Office
Ltd of £.1,407.38.

The claim relates to deficiencies in the accounts of Craig-y-Don Post Office while you held the office of
Sub Postmaster under a contract for services with Post Office Ltd.

Under the contract for services you are responsible for all losses occurring as a result of the acts or
omissions of yourself or your assistants. Deficiencies due to such losses must be made good without
delay and your responsibility for the losses does not cease when your appointment as Sub Postmaster
finishes.

You are, therefore, contractually liable to repay to Post Office Ltd the sum of £1,407.38. We should
therefore be grateful if you would let us have your proposals for repayment of the sum due.

Unless we hear from you within 14 days from the date of this letter, we will seek Post Office Ltd’s
instructions in relation to the issue of proceedings against you in the County Court for recovery of the sum
due. If proceedings are issued against you and Judgment obtained, you will also be liable to pay interest
on the sum due and solicitors costs. I

We trust this will not be necessary and look forward to hearing from you within the next 14 days.
