Meeting with Keith Todd, CEO ICL, 8 November 1999
Aide memoire on points at issue.
1. ICL’s performance in major public sector IT projects - especially ELGAR
and Horizon

Keith Todd should be left with no doubts about the seriousness DTI attaches to
ICL delivering on these.

We know Horizon has been difficult for all parties. (It has damaged relations
with Fujitsu, the largest single Japanese inward investor to the UK.)

DTI (and especially CII) as the “focus” for the information age needs to be
(and be seen as) an exemplar in its use of technology. There are alarming signs
that the ELGAR project is in some continuing difficulty.
2. Electronic Communications Bill
ICL one of the 100 or so to comment at length.
3. PIU and e-commerce
Any comments from ICL ?
4. Envisioning Centre
ICL’s continued commitment to this welcome, but be aware of two points:
«the other key partner SGI is in serious trouble, £145 million loss
first quarter, three changes of CEO in about a year, competitors
starting to match the capability.
e Industry support is largely “in kind”.
Nevertheless this state of the art demonstration centre is to be welcomed, and could
prove an important tool in DTI’s raising of awareness as regards the potential of the
new technologies.

5. Knowledge management

ICL have an opportunity to take a more active leadership position and should
be encouraged to be pro-active.
