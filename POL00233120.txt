Hi - yes, we are. Mark and his team have written to every single signatory, offering a meeting. One has taken us up -
Gareth Thomas who represents Harrow for Labour.

Despite pleas such as Andy Furey's, it looks to have found its limit at 28.
Not overly concerned.

Best wishes

Patrick

TO: CWU POSTMASTERS MEMBERS

Dear Member,

We are writing to bring your attention to an Early Day Motion (EDM 427) which has been tabled in
relation to the alleged problems with the Post Office Horizon system as featured in the BBC’s Panorama
POL00233120

POL00233120

programme on 17th August. The CWU is calling for a full judicial inquiry into this matter.

We would like to gain as much support for this EDM as possible, and we have therefore provided with
this email a model letter for Postmasters to use to write to their local MP to ask them to sign EDM 427.
The EDM reads as follows:

EDM 427: POST OFFICE HORIZON COMPUTER SYSTEM:

That this House notes with concern that a number of postmasters have been forced to pay back
thousands of pounds, or have been prosecuted or imprisoned, solely on the basis of questionable data
indicating cash shortfalls from the Post Office Horizon computer system introduced in 2000; further
notes that the BBC Panorama investigation on 17 August 2015, entitled Trouble at the Post Office,
demonstrated the damaging effect this has had on the lives of the postmasters involved; acknowledges
that the report by forensic accountants Second Sight into claims many sub-postmasters were wrongly
accused raises serious questions about the integrity of the Horizon system; expresses disappointment
with the dismissive response from the Post Office to the findings of the Second Sight report; notes the
concerns raised by the Business, Innovation and Skills Committee in the last Parliament in a letter to the
Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills, dated 17 March 2015, about the approach of the
Post Office to the subsequent mediation scheme; notes the Prime Minister's comment on 1 July 2015,
Official Report, column 1477, that the internal inquiry by the Post Office has not satisfied many hon.
Members on both sides of the House; commends the work of the former hon. Member for North
Hampshire, James Arbuthnot, for consistently raising this important issue in the last Parliament; and
urges the Government to establish a full independent judicial inquiry.

28 MPs have signed this EDM as of 18" September. The following link will take you to the EDM on the
parliamentary website, so you can double check whether your MP has already signed it.

Thank you for your support in this matter.
Best regards

Andy Furey
Assistant Secretary
CWU.
