HORIZON — DELOITTE REPORT

The Board welcomed Lesley Sewell, Chief Information Officer, and
Gareth James, Partner, Deloitte, to the meeting. Chris Aujard also re-
joined the meeting.

The Chairman thanked Gareth James for his draft report and
explained that there were a number of people who were sceptical
about Horizon, but that the Board were concerned to know the ‘truth’
about the reliability of the system and needed that ‘truth’ expressed in
such a way that it would persuade reasonable people.

Lesley Sewell explained that the first piece of work Deloitte had been
asked to undertake was to give assurance that the control framework,
including the security and processes for changes in the system, were
robust from an IT perspective.

Gareth James reported that all the work to date showed that the
system had strong areas of control and that its testing and
implementation were in line with best practice. Work was still needed
to assure the controls and access at the Finance Service Centre.

Chris Aujard explained that several of the subpostmasters who were
challenging Horizon had made allegations about ‘phantom’
transactions which were non-traceable. Assurance from Deloitte
about the integrity of the system records logs would be very valuable.

The Board asked what assurance could be given pre 2010 when the
different Horizon system was in use. It was agreed that Gareth James
would produce and cost a proposal for additional work to enable
assurance for the wider system, including pre 2010.

Lesley Sewell, Gareth James and Chris Aujard left the meeting.
