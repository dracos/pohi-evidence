Dear Colin
Re: OBCS Failure on 8" November 2001

I have reviewed the response to Liz Tuddenham from Tom Chriyan,
dated 8 October 2002, in response to Post Office Limited's claim for
compensation for the incident relating to the failure of the OBCS on 8
November 2001.

Having now reviewed both your response and our original claim, I
agree with your view that lost income should not be included. However,
I do not agree with your other proposed reductions of the Post Office
assessment.

You proposal that Fujitsu liability relates only to the period of 5 hours 9
minutes, ending when Fujitsu Services transmitted the MBS message,
takes no account of the further elapsed time until staff in our branches
received and could be expected to have read the MBS (4 hours is
allowed for delivery of MBS messages), nor of the fact that the MBS
only mitigated the problem, but did not solve it.

The use of the MBS and the effectiveness of that MBS has been
factored into our calculation of actual additional staff costs and call
charges, as shown in our breakdown of the costs.

Your proposal that PO Ltd should pay half the normal price for the MBS
is not acceptable. This MBS was necessary solely because of a failure
by Fujitsu Services to provide the contracted OBCS service. Therefore
the full cost for the MBS should be borne by Fujitsu Services as is
usual practice in such circumstances.

Re: OBCS Failures

In conclusion Fujitsu’s revised proposal is not acceptable to PO Ltd and
our revised claim for direct costs is £14,657.02. I look forward to
Fujitsu’s acceptance of this figure as settlement of the OBCS failure.

The OBCS failures in branches on 8" November 2001 resulted in direct
additional costs in Post Office transaction processing until 13"
November 2001. We have not included these costs in our calculations
and are prepared to accept the above amount in full and final
settlement of our claim in relation to this incident. However we may
review this position in light of your response to this letter.

Yours sincerely,
