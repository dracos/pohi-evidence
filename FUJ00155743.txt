Thanks, Gareth. No, we are not concerned with 2001 and prior. Our earliest data is, I think, from May 2002.

Hi Penny,
Yes, that looks fine.

I assume that we're not concerned about problems in 2001 or earlier? When I looked at the PEAK yesterday that fixed
Transfer IN, it indicated that other fixes had been made in 2001 for other transactions. It wasn’t very specific and I
think it best to ignore it.

Regards

Gareth

Hi Gareth

Thanks for your help yesterday. I’ve simplified the text in the statement and incorporated the fix. I propose:-
The Horizon system records time in GMT and takes no account of Civil Time
Displacements. There was, however, one exception which related to the category of

transactions ‘Transfer In’ where events recorded in the Transaction Logs were shown in
local time. This meant that during the designated summer months ‘Transfer In’ log entries
FUJ00155743
FUJ00155743

were recorded in BST instead of GMT and showed a one hour forward displacement in time
from other transactions being recorded in the logs. This anomaly was corrected prior to BST
2005 since when ‘Transfer In’ log entries have been recorded in GMT, consistent with all
other transactions being recorded in the logs.

Do you think it’s OK?

Kind regards
Penny

Penny,
This is the first I've heard of this anomaly. I've just tried it out (ie carrying out a transfer) and as far as I can
tell all Transfers are recorded in the normal way (ie with times in GMT — since it is currently BST it is easy to

tell!).

Do you know where that statement came form and do you have any examples where it is an issue?
