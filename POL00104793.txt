REPORTING OF CRIMINAL OFFENCES TO POLICE

PURPOSE

The aim of this policy is to advise Security Managers of the availability of standardised forms for
reporting offences etc.

LINK TO ACCOUNTABILITIES

Security Managers

POLICY

The development of the Phoenix National Criminal Justice Record Service has enabled the Association
of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) Disclosure Group to design national standardised forms for the
reporting of offences and the results of prosecutions/cautions to Police Authorities.

The standard forms, which are designed for use by all Non Police Prosecuting Agencies (NPAs), have
been provided to all Security Managers

1 Form NPA I - Source Input Document for Phoenix
2. Form NPA 2 - Continuation Sheet for additional offences
3 Form NPA 3 - Notification of result of case (PSO use only)

The Home Office has stipulated that in the interests of consistency each N P A should have one central
point of contact to whom the Police Authorities will send details of previous convictions. That role is
undertaken by SIS, Prosecution Support Office (PSO (Croydon, Leeds and Bristol)) and all Police
Authorities in England and Wales have been notified accordingly.

REPORTING PROCESS

During the course of a suspect interview, investigators should complete the offender details on side 1 of
form NPAI, (Name, sex, DOB, etc.) and all of side 2, which deals with identification details of the
suspect. Form CS033 (Antecedent history) should also be completed and placed in the case papers for
the attention of Legal Services. (An aide memoir on completing NPA forms is associated at pages
4106.)

e —Incases of arrest and subsequent charge of a suspect, investigators will complete the Police
Source Input Documents and the Police will process the information for inputting to the Police
National Computer. Investigators should ensure that photographs and fingerprints are taken at this
time. If the case is then prosecuted by Consignia, investigators should submit the NPA forms or
copies of the Police Source Input Documents to their respective PSO.

© — Ifthe person has not been in police detention, the remainder of Side 1 of form NPAI should be
completed once the application has been made for summonses or authority is given for the offender
to be cautioned. (From Prosecuting Agents downwards.) It is important to remember that any
additional offences charged must be listed separately on form NPA2's. (Offences "Taken into
Consideration" (TIC's) should not be entered onto form NPA2's. ) The completed NPA1 form
(and NPA2's where necessary). should be submitted to the relevant PSO at this time, to
enable a criminal record to be created or updated.

Copies of the NPA documentation should also be placed into the case file.
© On receipt of the cases papers, Legal Services will consider the evidence and, where it is sufficient
to prosecute or caution, request a certificate of conviction from the PSO before advising further

action.

e _ Ifithas been decided to prosecute, the relevant PSO Office will write to the Police requesting

photographs and fingerprints to be taken after conviction (not afer sentence) using Typist Draht
Letter CS040B. NB. The PSO will need later to notify the Police of any subsequent conviction
using Typist Draft CS040C in order that the Police can carry out the request under Section 27 of
PACE which allows for the compulsory taking of photographs and fingerprints within one month
of conviction provided the offender has not at any stage been in Police detention.

* — Onconviction, Legal Services will notify the PSO who should then send details to the Police using
CS040 for photographs and fingerprints to be taken (see above). This should be done following
conviction and not sentence which may be up to 4 weeks after conviction,

When sentence has been passed, Legal Services will notify the Investigator and PSO of the outcome.
The PSO will report the result to the relevant Police Authority by means of form NPA 3.
