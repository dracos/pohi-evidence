Hi Kay

Our telcon refers.

As discussed, I require the NBSC call logs for the branches listed below. I have also included the period required as it is
important that we only have information relating to the subpostmasters named below although I'm not sure how far our

records go back.

This information is required as part of the evidence being supplied to Second Sight, the external forensic auditors
appointed by POL to investigate challenges by subpostmasters over the integrity of the Horizon system.

In view of the importance of this issue, I would like this information by close of business today or early tomorrow at the
latest if possible. If you have any problems meeting this deadline, please let me know.

Many thanks for your help.

Regards

Nigel Allen

Our tel discussion refers.

As discussed, here is a list of former subpostmasters and branches where I need the date of the subpostmaster's

logs etc. for the correct period of time.

West Byfleet —- 126023 - Seema Mishra
Hockley — 082140 - Terence Walters
