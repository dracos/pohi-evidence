Tim hi,
A quick build on Jane’s note to the Board.
Tom copying you as we talked this am.

We discussed in some detail. Jane was not defensive and listened well. She is understandably
frustrated and her note to the board is a good summary of why.

But the onus is on us to change our tack. We agreed Jane will put the following in place asap:
1) speak to the whole team - everyone needs to take a step back and think more carefully about
the ‘how’ not just the ‘what’

2) she has already spoken to Rod, our litigation lawyer, who saw the submission but didn’t spot
the wording - no doubt he regrets the error

3) future submissions will have a second legal check and the comms team will then read for
‘tone’; Jane will read all of the next ones

4) meet Andy Burrows, the WBD lawyer who wrote the offending statement; reassure herself that
he ‘gets’ the issue

5) meet the QCs and agree how they will redress the tone

I will support Jane, and follow up each action with her next week. Once I’ve been debriefed on
4), I will call one of the managing partners at WBD, who I know well. I want a personal
reassurance.

Please don’t forward this.
Let me know if you have questions.

Best,
Paula
