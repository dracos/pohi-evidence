Thanks Steve,

Given the date ranges on the attachments, is it the case that the disc served on the defence did not
in fact cover the entire indictment period i.e. 14/9/10 to 9/2/11?

As you can see from the e mail below I have made contact with their expert. I will have a look at what they are after
and see what I can do. I have also extended the offer of visiting a trainings school to see how the system works and
with a visit behind the counter for “real” time operation

I explained the headings and used the age old term of it is a posh calculator and records all key strokes. If I can sort
out the data she is happy for me to put the long name in and send the data to her by e mail rather than get another disc
with the long names in.

Think that is all she wants for know.

Dear Steve

Further to our telephone conversation this afternoon, the following documents which have not been
disclosed to me to date are what is required:-

1. The Horizon data for the missing period - ie 09.09.10 to 10.01.11. As I explained on the telephone
the data on the disc I have been provided with is described as “ARQ 135 — 139 9 SEP 10 to 9 Feb 11
Birkenshaw” but unfortunately has been redacted to cover only 11.01.11 to 09.02.11 (see attached
spreadsheets)

2. Stock records in the same format as $B/5 and SB/6 for all dates during the indictment period.

3. Stock received records (for stamps), in the same format as SB/23, for the missing periods during
the indictment - ie. 02.11.10 to 17.11.10 and 17.12.10 to 08.02.11.

4. Exhibit SB/23 contains copies of the Final Branch Trading Statements from 15.09.10 to
12.01.11. Copies for the remaining period of the indictment - i.e. 13.01.11 to 09.02.11 are
therefore also required.

Please advise which of the above documents you will be in a position to provide and if any are not within your
control please advise accordingly.

I appreciate your assistance and look forward to hearing from you soon.
