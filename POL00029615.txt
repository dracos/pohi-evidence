So this response is fine as far as it goes but it does play into Ian's comments about assertions; there
is no point us just saying things as facts unless we can give Second Sight the evidence that those
assertions are based on.

Attached is the current version of the SROOS response document.

This has been through Andrew Parsons (Bond Dickinson) for review. For completeness, Rodric williams
(legal), also has also been provided with a copy just so he can run his eye over it.

Could you make an attempt to read through this document ahead of our meeting this morning. I'm hopeful
that we can get to a position where we clear this for issue to Second sight later today.

I also attach the original Spot Review from Second Sight.

Just to provide a brief update on SROOS response.

I have drafted the response and this was issued to Andrew Parsons (legal) at Bond Dickinson on Tuesday.
The response contains the following:

- Set_up and configuration of the POL assigned areas within the Breakdown site in 2008. This includes the
1st floor and basement areas.

- Technical positioning of the POL test environment within Breakdown in 2008 in relation to it's build
and complete separation to the live production environment.

- Formal responses to TC related questions raised by Second Sight.

- Formal response to the enquiry relating to whether Branch Accounting (now P&BA) had access to branch
accounts and were able to change them through the TC process.

- A summary of our (POL) attempts to align Mr Rudkins stated visit to Bracknell in 2008 with our internal
records of projects\activities that were in place in 2008.

Fujitsu are continuing to conduct an audit trail of the number of times the manual process has been
activated for TCs. To date they have identified one instance. Simon is keeping tabs on this.

Andrew is currently reviewing the draft response and in speaking with him this morning feels there are
just one or two tweaks needed from the original draft. He will have a further version ready by CoP

today.

I suggest once I receive this that the three of you need to cast your eyes over it and provide authority
as to it’s readiness for submission into SS. We can agree this at tomorrow’s meeting.

In the meantime, any other points you need to raise, let me know.
