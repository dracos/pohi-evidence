POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY

FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF VINCENT GASKELL

|, Mr Vincent Gaskell , will say as follows:

1. Before my retirement in 2010, | had been civil servant throughout my career.
My experience included a range of junior and senior management operational
roles before progressing into project and change management roles within the
Benefits Agency, BA, including programme management for the agency's
Customer Accounting and Payment System(CAPS). Subsequent roles included
the Change Director within the Child Support Agency, then Chief Executive of
the Criminal Records Bureau within the Home Office. My last role before
retirement was as a board member of the Identity and Passport Service within

the Home Office.

2. This witness statement is made to assist the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry
(the “Inquiry”) with the matters set out in the Rule 9 Request dated 30 May

2022 (the “Request’).

3. | have been asked to set out the background of my involvement in the Horizon
project. | had no direct involvement in the Horizon project but, in late 1997 | was
asked to be the Programme Manager for the Benefits Agency Customer
Accounting and Payments System, CAPS. | had no involvement with the
programme before that date. | reported to the Benefits Agency's Programme
Director who had overall responsibility for the Agency’s involvement in the
BA/POCL (Post Office Counters Limited) programme as | understood it to be
called then.

4. As the CAPS programme manager my focus and responsibilities were primarily
on the development of CAPS and the links to benefit systems. For example
after | took over the programme, my team prepared for and managed the upload
of millions of benefit recipients records on a regular basis onto CAPS systems.
In addition we had to train many thousands of BA staff to use the new systems.
So my information about the progress on the Horizon system only came from
the reports | received before each Horizon service delivery board meeting or
from the reports the Post Office submitted to the Caps and Card Programme
Board chaired by the programme director. The Programme Design Authority
had a more active role in following the development of the Horizon system.

5. In addition, BA/DSS (Department of Social Security) Finance colleagues had a
role in continuing to make sure there was integrity in the benefit payment
system (they were the experts) including with card payments. | do not recall
them raising an issue about duplicate or incomplete transactions but | cannot
be certain.

6. | continued as Programme Manager until early 1999 (| think February) when |

became the Programme Director for the Benefits Agency's role in the BA/POCL

WITNO04140100
WITN04140100

programme which included the ongoing oversight of the CAPS programme. |
also became responsible for leading the BA’s input to the Department of Social
Security and their involvement in the HMT (HM Treasury) review of the overall
programme. As the programme director | also assumed responsibility for the
ongoing commercial and contractual matters with the Post Office and ICL for
the Payment Card programme.

. Shortly before | became the CAPS Programme Manager there had been a
major replan undertaken and agreed between the BA, Post Office Counters Ltd
and ICL Pathway. My role was to have overall responsibility for the
development and implementation of CAPS systems in support of the Payment
Card Scheme within the BA/POCL Programme.

. This included: ensuring the CAPS Programme successfully implemented its
major software releases on time; ensuring that the Agency's Benefit Systems
had viable plans to migrate onto CAPS successfully and on time; developing
and implementing training plans for all BA staff in the use of CAPS systems;
ensure there were effective overall project management controls in place for
CAPS; and to ensure effective working relationships with the overarching
Programme Design Authority. | was accountable to the BA Programme Director
and reported to the CAPS Programme Board.

. My role on the Release Authorisation Board | believe was to provide assurance
and progress reports on CAPS and to respond to queries. In addition, if there
were any issues identified by the Release Authorisation Board that might have
had a direct impact on the development of CAPS, | would report those issues

to the CAPS programme board together with any impact assessment. The

Page 3 of 13

WITN04140100

Board would also receive reports from the Programme Design Authority and
from the Post Office Horizon team.

10.1 have been asked to provide a brief explanation of the purpose and functions
of; the Benefits Payment Service (BPS), Benefits Encashment Service (BES),
CAPS and the Order Book Control System (OBCS). | cannot now recall the
specific function of either the Benefit Payment Service, Benefits Encashment
Service or the Order Book Control System and there may be others better
qualified to do so.

11.CAPS - prior to the development of CAPS, there was no consistent way in which
each of the Agency's Benefit Systems captured and recorded a customer's
personal details. Each system made and recorded payments to customers from
that specific system. The purpose of CAPS was to design, develop and
implement a common and consistent way for BA staff to capture and enter a
customer's personal details onto each benefit system and then to convert the
existing case load on each system to the new way of recording those customer
details. This also enabled the creation of a ‘customer account’ in which
customer payments could be recorded in a consistent manner for all benefit
systems. It also provided the means by which individual or combined benefit
payments could be paid to a benefit recipient through a third party, for example
the benefit payment card or through a bank by automated credit transfer.

12.| have been asked to describe the problems faced by the Horizon project in the
Autumn of 1997 and my understanding about the technical integrity and
robustness of Horizon at that time. As | recall, at the time | became the CAPS
Programme Manager in the Autumn of 1997, the interfaces and data links

between CAPS and ICL were already in place and working. Payment data for

Page 4 of 13
WITNO04140100
WITN04140100

some Child Benefit customers was being transferred and card payments in a
few Post Offices were being made. Progress on CAPS was good and on
schedule.

13.1 cannot recall the detail but there were ongoing issues with ICL to agree more
detailed dates for ongoing development and testing. These issues meant
renegotiation and planning with each of the BA’s benefit systems that all had
their own individual work programmes to incorporate policy changes, benefit
uprating, or system upgrades. This became an ever increasing problem. Each
change by ICL meant carrying out impact assessments with each benefit
system and adjusting their work programmes accordingly which, at times,
meant deferring much needed work on those systems. Each change in plan or
schedule led to increasing frustration by BA managers.

14.As to problems and issues faced by the Horizon project, | cannot add any more
information or comment than is contained in the Horizon Business Continuity
Reports overseen by the Programme Delivery Authority (Exhibits WITN0414-
01/1, WITN0414-01/2, WITN0414-01/3 and WITN0414-01/4). The day to day
responsibility for the development and operation of the Horizon system was
between the Post Office and ICL.

15.It was not my role to provide reports to Ministers at this time but as the
Programme Manager for CAPS | reported to the Programme Director who
chaired the CAPS and Card Programme Board. Progress reports on CAPS
were submitted to him and the Board. Similarly, the Programme Design
Authority provided regular reports for the Programme as a whole to the Director
and the Board. At that time too, the Director was a member of the BA

Management Board and reported to the agency Chief Executive.

WITN04140100

16.1 am not aware of feedback by users of the Horizon system other than through
the Business Continuity reports. Some issues arose periodically with Benefit
Card recipients but these were usually about process (customers unable to get
to a Post Office) and resolved quickly.

17.The Horizon project proceeded and between January and May 1998 card
payments to Child Benefit customers continued. From a CAPS perspective,
though | cannot now recall the detail, as mentioned in Exhibit WITN0414-01/5,
there were occasional and sometimes ongoing issues to resolve with ICL.
Some of these, once analysed, were about process such as dealing with
disabled customers. However there were also more significant software issues
to resolve by ICL relating to inactivated cards that would have directly impacted
on benefit customers. On these occasions we had to press ICL to explain why
the problems were happening and to arrange urgent software fixes to resolve
them.

18. The Horizon Service Delivery reports make clear, there was increasing concern
being expressed by the Post Office from December 1997 onwards, about lost
transactions and duplicate payments within the Horizon system. | have no
recollection of these affecting card payments and they were outside of my area
of responsibility. | cannot recall the detail and had no visibility of the specific
nature of the transactions. My only information came from the service delivery
reports provided the Post Office team to the Service Delivery Board.

19.1 was aware that Post Office representatives were pressing ICL for a better
understanding of why the problems were occurring and for quicker resolution

of them through software fixes by ICL.

Page 6 of 13
WITNO04140100
WITN04140100

20. Those concerns expressed by the Post Office continued throughout the period
and, as reflected in the Horizon Service Delivery reports, extended to
transaction processing generally and the pace of resolution of the issues and
problems.

21.Overall progress on the Programme, including from the Service Delivery
reports, would have been reported to senior officials within the BA through the
CAPS and Card Programme Board by the Post Office and the Programme
Delivery Authority. | cannot recall what reports might have been submitted to
Ministers.

22.During this period and throughout the payment card programme, my
recollection of surveys of child benefit customers using the service did not
produce any significant issues and was broadly neutral in their use of the
payment card.

23.1 have been asked to describe the problems faced by the Horizon project
between June and December 1998. | had no responsibility for or direct
involvement in the day to day operation of the Horizon system within the Post
Office other than through the ICL/CAPS interface. To the best of my knowledge
| only became aware of the issues and challenges the Horizon system faced
from the Service Delivery Reports and my attendance at the Horizon Service
Delivery Board meetings. It was evident that the Post Office had ongoing
concerns about lost and duplicate transactions. The risk to business continuity
in the Post Office was raised during this period by the Post Office and by the
Programme Design Authority. There were also indications that the Post Office
and ICL did not agree on the underlying reasons for the problems (Exhibit

WITN0414-01/6).

WITNO04140100
WITN04140100

24.By June 1998 the BA became aware that ICL had missed a key milestone in
the development of their next major software release (Exhibit WITN0414-01/7
issue 4). In addition a key element of their work for that release, the Data
Interface Definition and Validation (DIDVR), had also been delayed. | do not
recall the detail but CAPS, and the Benefit Systems, would need the DIDVR to
complete the development work and preparation for future testing. This was a
further erosion in the perceived credibility of |\CL/Horizon plans.

25.Within the BA we were increasingly concerned about:

- the slow progress on resolving problems within the Horizon system as
reported by the Post Office;

- The apparent lack of visibility by the Post Office of the design and
development of some key elements of the Horizon system (for example
EPOSS) and the reported lack of transparency by ICL. (Exhibit
WITN0414-01/7)

- ICL missing some further key delivery dates (for example the completion
of development work for their next software release due at the end of
May 1998) and the lack of visibility of future plans from ICL. These
matters are contained in the listed documentation provided.

26. These concerns were reported and discussed with senior managers in the BA
and with the Post Office. Though the CAPS programme had met all its delivery
dates and remained on schedule, the BA pressed the Post Office for a more
realistic testing and implementation timetable for the next ICL software release
date and a review of Service Delivery. The Post Office agreed to conduct a

review of their Service Delivery with assistance from the BA. They also agreed

Page 8 of 13
WITNO04140100
WITN04140100

to discuss planning concerns with ICL. However the dates for the next ICL
software release and future testing did not change as | recall.

27.Later in the year the Post Office reported that a major series of system tests of
the Horizon system had failed to demonstrate the required integrity of the
system and its interface to the Post Office domain. As a consequence the Post
Office said that joint testing with the BA had to be deferred with further
replanning needed. This phase of testing was an important stage prior to a ‘Live
Trial’ in 1999 and acceptance.

28.1 have been asked to comment on the Horizon project between January and
May 1999. By early 1999 more details were reported of the problems, faults
and issues that had been raised during the last phase of systems tests of the
Horizon system (referred to as MOR3 and End to End 2 in the documentation
supplied). We did not have the detail of the faults and PinICLs but the number
and reported severity were of concern prior to a Live Trial and possible
acceptance. However, as | recall, there were some significant issues faced by
some Benefit Payment Card customers following a Horizon Data Centre
Migration in May 1999. | cannot recall the specifics but it did lead to a number
of emergency payments having to be made to some of the card customers.

29.In addition, and again | cannot recall the detail, | and senior management within
the BA, were increasingly concerned about testing as a whole with ICL/Horizon.
Paragraphs 7-14 of Exhibit WITN0414-01/8 set out the major issues as we saw
them. These included: the scope of testing (paragraph 7-8); how BA and the
Post Office viewed the outcome of recent test runs (paragraphs 8-13); the lack
of detail behind test results conducted between the Post Office and ICL

(paragraphs 12-15); the lack of visibility of the severity of the PinICLs found in

Page 9 of 13
WITNO04140100
WITN04140100

the last test run. These and the planning delays affected the confidence of BA
managers in how best to proceed specifically in relation to replanning and
testing (paragraphs 16-21).

30. There was a clear difference of view between the BA and the Post Office on
how best to proceed which is set out in paragraphs 24-31 of Exhibit WITN0414-
01/8 and those views were fed into the HMT review at that time.

31.The BA continued to press for another round of testing before entering the Live
Trial and extended Post Office roll out. The Post Office disagreed and
subsequently the BA took the decision not to enter the Live Trial. That decision
was discussed with senior managers in the BA and DSS and also with DSS
ministers.

32.My involvement with the Treasury Review of the Programme as a whole was to
report on progress on CAPS, and to consider and assess options for a way
forward. However, when | became the BA Programme Director in early 1999, |
became responsible for leading the work within the BA with HMT, through the
Department of Social Security, and for the commercial and contractual matters
with POCL and with ICL.

33. It is my understanding, and as reported by the National Audit office in their
report dated 18 August 2000, that in May 1999 the government decided that
removing the payment card from the BA/POCL programme offered better value
for money than complete cancellation, would better protect the early automation
of the Post Office, and was preferable to continuation.

34. Following the Ministerial decision my involvement with the Horizon project was
to lead on behalf of the DSS and BA, with the commercial and contractual

ramifications of that decision which included the termination of the Benefit

Page 10 of 13
WITNO04140100
WITN04140100

Payment Card, the withdrawal of cards from existing customers, ongoing
payment of services provided by the Post Office (for example payments made
by order book). The outcome of those negotiations with ICL is set out in Exhibit
WITN0414-01/9. Other documents set out what was agreed with the Post Office
| also continued to oversee the implementation of CAPS across the BA benefit
Systems and to work with the BA and the Department of Social Security to plan
for the introduction of the payment of Benefits by Automated Credit Transfer
into peoples bank accounts. Later that year | joined the Board of the Child
Support Agency and had no further involvement with the CAPS programme or
the Post Office.

35.1 can think of no other matter to assist the Chair.
