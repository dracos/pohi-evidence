Each Director of the Company who had an interest under sections 177 and/or 182 of the

5. CEO update

It was noted that the workforce is currently working at full capacity with demand for UKGI’s support
increasing. Whilst secondments have been secured, the quality of candidates yielded by an
ongoing process to recruit new EDs was low, and thus the risk of over-stretch remains high. It
was noted that the increase in the workforce will drive cost pressures which will require clarity
from HMT as to the longer term funding envelope.

The role of UKGI in dealing with the aftermath of the various economic interventions was briefly
discussed ahead of the strategy discussion later in the agenda, but noting that UKGI as currently
constituted was not equipped to manage the various debt and equity stakes government may
take in a number of businesses.

The CEO expressed his gratitude to the people of UKGI who have come together and worked
tirelessly offering support to projects and workstreams since the crisis begun. Whilst the recent
staff pulse survey results showed that there a slight downward trend, a strong emphasis on
communication helps to mitigate this risk. The senior team continue to discuss support
mechanisms for staff.

6. People

The Board noted that the resourcing requirements remains tight but manageable. The ED
recruitment process was discussed; an external agency will be required to widen the field of
applicants. The Board were invited to share details of any potential candidates for the role with
the COO.

In respect of staff wellbeing, the initial support processes include forum meetings at each grade
level to discuss issues and potential solutions, which will then be fed back to the COO. In addition
to that there continues to be a programme of activities for staff to get engaged with including
various social activities. The COO is exploring the option of giving staff opportunity to move from
a project if they wish to do so.

The Board discussed the importance of taking annual leave to enable staff to get an actual break.
The COO explained that the expectation is that all staff will be required to take at least two weeks
leave by the end of the annual leave year, and the remaining leave allowance will be rolled over
to the following two years.

7. Governance, Portfolio and Risk update

The Board noted the update on governance activities. The three key themes arising from the
portfolio reviews were increasing stresses around remuneration, appointments and flight risk;
deteriorating cash positions; and year-end issues around audit, going concern and accounts

preparation.

UKGI require further assurances that Homes England has dealt with Ceri Smith's resignation from
its Board in the correct way.

The success of the recent informal RemCo chairs’ event was noted; the Board encouraged the
team to schedule further sessions including audit and risk, and sustainability.

On risk, the Board again noted again the usefulness of the COVID-19 tracker in the current
circumstances. The Board was briefly updated on the on-going challenges for the Post Office
and will discuss in further detail at the next meeting. The Board were also informed of the work
UKGI have been involved in on the Trade Credit Insurance. UKGI’s current role is to provide
commercial advice to BEIS. A portfolio project review is scheduled within the next week to be
discussed in further detail. The Board were notified of the issues at NATS, which has been
severely affected by COVID-19, causing a negative financial impact to the company. A portfolio
review meeting on NATS took place a week prior, and the following issues were highlighted as a
cause for concern: significant cash flow problems, lack of dialogue with DfT resulting in insufficient
information flow, and lack of clarity around UKGI's role.

8. CFO Report
The CFO noted that control totals for this year are highly likely to be breached, but that this will

likely be dealt with satisfactorily via the supplementaries. The expansion of UKGI’s headcount
also presents a risk to future years’ budget position.

12. Board Effectiveness review

The Board were thanked for their input into the recent internal board effectiveness review. Overall
there were no material issues identified. The Board discussed its composition and agreed that
the feedback from the review is timely with the upcoming refresh of NED’s. They agreed that the
future composition of the Board should be considered in parallel with UKGI’s future, which will
again be discussed at the upcoming Board/ExCo strategy session.

The outcome of the review led to some proposed recommendations. The Board agreed with all
of the recommendations, the Chairman and Company Secretary agreed to implement these and
will revert back to the Board on their progress in due course.

13. Forward look

The Board duly noted the updated forward look.

There being no other business, the meeting duly closed at 16:30.

information as the Company may reasonably require relating to such right of
recovery and the steps taken or to be taken by the Director in connection with it;

amount as shallhave been so paid by the Company,

and the amount of any repayment by the Director under this sub-clause 2.5 in respect of

repayment (if any) to the Company of the same expenditure governed by sub-clause
2.3.

Ifthe Director, by reason of his own default, fails to comply with his obligations under
Clause 3 in any material respect then the Company's obligation to indemnify the
Director under sub-clause 2.1 inrespect of the relevant Indemnity Claim shall be limited
to the amount which the Director would have been entitled to receive pursuant to such

Indemnity Claim) the Director shall:

existence of such Indemnity Claim (or circumstances), giving reasonably full

Ref: UKGI-BP-448 .
Category: Paper circulated, for discussion is}
b
The overall context of this report is that UKGI remains extremely busy and that demand .
for our services is increasing. In terms of demand, we have had a number of ad-hoc
requests for relatively short-term pieces of work, which cumulatively are absorbing &
significant resource. These include (but are not limited to): supporting HMG’s acquisition .
of a £500m stake in OneWeb, the Low Earth Orbit satellite company, and establishing a
shareholder role; providing a panel member for the tailored review of the Government &E
Property Agency; providing credit risk support to the HMT FD in her role approving °
guarantee requests under the UK Guarantee Scheme for infrastructure projects;
supporting DCMS on a review of the BBC’s borrowing limits; support for DCMS in the a
design of a TV and film industry reinsurance scheme; providing commercial and
corporate finance input into the design of DCMS'’s ‘cultural recovery fund’ to support the =
creative arts sector; and advising BEIS on the design and structuring of a funding model a
for carbon capture and storage. We had to decline to be involved in the cultural recovery
fund and the carbon capture and storage projects, and are further investigating a
the OneWeb request. )
ExCo has thoroughly reviewed and challenged each of these requests as we have =
revitalised the ExCo approval process for new business. In all cases where we have 9°
taken on the new assignments, there have been compelling strategic reasons for
undertaking the work. Should any of these develop into more significant mandates, &
formal Board endorsement will be sought in the normal way. .
In the longer term we are in discussions with HMT over two major new assignments for S
UKGI. The first, Asset Co, has been discussed here previously and I will provide a
verbal update on latest thoughts on UKGI's role at the meeting, as the position continues
to evolve. It remains clear that there should be a substantial requirement for UKGI's 8
involvement.

Secondly, HMT is considering where to house a function that would provide capability
for government in dealing with contingent liabilities. No final decisions have been Lad
taken. This function would comprise actuaries, statisticians, credit risk analysts,
corporate financiers and policy advisers, and so encompass a similarly diverse range of

skills to the team we successfully assembled for the Student Loans sale programme. -
The government’s stock of guarantees and other contingent liabilities was increasing
even before the COVID-19 pandemic, and this function would assist government in =
assessing risk and pricing these instruments. One of the options that HMT is considering .
is a joint unit between UKGI and the Government Actuary’s department. As well as the
impact on our own staffing — we would need to recruit skillsets that we don’t currently a
possess - we may need to consider how the skills mix on the Board can support this role, .
and whether we need to recruit additional specific skills and experience.

_

Both of these roles would likely involve substantial increases in our headcount, probably
taking UKGI to a point where our organisational structure would need to change. Mark
Russell always spoke of “Dunbar’s number” with 150 staff being the threshold above 00
which our current model as a single operating unit would need alteration. Our current
number of people is 136. I have been working with Susie Timlin and Rob Razzell to give
some early thought to preparation for this eventuality. ©

A further observation on these actual and potential new roles is that the demand stems

from UKGI’s deep financial, numerical and commercial expertise. Once you had 5
navigated past the quotes from Gramsci, you will have noted that in his recent Ditchley .
lecture, Michael Gove stated that government needs more people “who are equipped to rm
read a balance sheet and discuss what constitutes an appropriate return on investment, p
more who are conversant with the commercial practices of those from whom we procure
services”. This observation, alongside the picture of increasing pressure on our
resources, speaks to UKGI's unique role in government, and to the case for a properly nN
resourced and funded specialist corporate finance and corporate governance function.

am
The CCFF and Birch projects continue to require very significant senior-level input. We a
are gradually obtaining greater clarity over the respective roles and responsibilities for
HMT, UKGI and HMT’s advisers, McKinsey, and over the overall policy framework, but a IN
recent UKGI Project Review does point for the clarity to be finalised as a matter of .
urgency. This will ensure we operate within our own risk parameters and will help, for
example, with resolving the position regarding the end of McKinsey’s current contract a
which is later this month. .
I have now completed my one-to-one meetings with all staff and I am now commencing a
a programme of “brown bag” lunch meetings with a randomly selected group of eight to .
ten staff members to try and maintain engagement throughout this period. Whilst my
introductory meetings with Departments have been moving along during this period, I a
now intend to pick up the velocity of meetings with Chairs and CEOs at our assets.
Broadly speaking, I am receiving positive feedback internally on our strategy and UKGI &
is fit and well. However, the stresses and strains of working from home, combined with
our increased workloads, are clearly being felt by some staff members more than an
others. I think our Director and ExCo group is particularly pressed in this regard, although 2°
I again note their consistent support and significant efforts in this very busy period.

y
Our corporate finance ED recruitment is well underway, with two search agencies °
engaged, both having been tasked to deliver diverse longlists. We have recruited one
ED, Martin Hurst, a former EY divestments partner, on a six-month contract, to provide R

support on the vaccines workstream, pending the completion of our permanent

recruitment process.

We will be saying goodbye to one of our ADs, Rob Faull at the end of this month. Having

made a good recovery from a serious illness, he is taking well-deserved retirement after

a career in the civil service — having joined ShEx in 2004, he is our longest serving -

member of staff — I’m sure you will join me in wishing him well.

As the July days tick by, we are sending out a very strong message to staff that they e

must try and get some rest and relaxation over the summer months. In this regard,

l intend to lead by example and take some holiday in August, having had just half a day a

of leave since December. I think it is particularly important to pace ourselves for the .

1. UKGI’s overarching objectives:

To monitor POL's operational and financial performance against its agreed
commitments and goals

To challenge and support POL on their strategy and approach regarding the
recently settled Horizon litigation and associated activities

To promote good corporate governance

To provide constructive challenge on POL’s strategic decisions

To support the expanded BEIS Policy Team

To keep Ministers, Perm Sec and UKGI updated

2. Key deliverables and milestones:

In recent months, the UKGI team has had many successes and the key milestones are
highlighted below:

Litigation: UKGI NED pushed for changes in the internal and external legal
teams and a mindset change that led to the December 2019 settlement. This
issue attracts a significant amount of parliamentary and media attention. UKGI is
now proactively proposing solutions to the way cases going to the Court of Appeal
are managed and how any compensation payable could be funded.
Leadership: A new CEO was recruited in late 2019 and he has made a positive
start by pushing for the litigation settlement, overhauling the executive team and
overseeing the Covid-19 response. Two NEDs have recently been recruited.
Covid-19: The team assisted with POL’s response by facilitating flexibility in
POL’s contractual requirements on the network and working capital facility. This
has helped to protect service provision across the UK during the pandemic.
Funding: Engaged with POL on key issues such as its 4YP and subsequent
Spending Review bid. These were put on hold due to Covid-19, but much of the
work is not wasted and is becoming more critical with current funding expiring in
March 2021. The 20/21 budget was delayed due to Covid-19 but has now been
agreed at Board level.

Strategy: Acted as a critical friend, including on the renegotiated contract with
Bank of Ireland, its updated Banking Framework, its back-office Telecoms
contract and potential sale, as well as its new contract with Royal Mail.
Governance: A Framework Document was put in place in March 2020, alongside
amended Articles. These formalised quarterly meetings and have helped to
improve our oversight and governance of POL. These were delivered behind
schedule due to challenges in agreeing drafting with POL.

Investments: Worked with POL’s finance team to push significant improvements
in internal controls so that projects are being run more efficiently and the reporting
to the Board and BEIS is markedly better.

3. Progress update, key risks and mitigants (including high / medium / low rating
for probability and impact):

a) Horizon IT Litigation (high, high):

In December 2019 POL settled a high-profile and long running litigation between it and
555 (mostly former) postmasters related to the Horizon IT system.

Convicted Postmasters: As of 3 June the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC)
had decided to refer to the Court of Appeal 47 out of 61 cases of postmasters convicted

by POL of criminal offences, where evidence used to convict included information drawn
from the Horizon IT system (we anticipate another 7 cases will be referred shortly). If
these cases are overturned POL would be exposed to potential claims of compensation.
In April, the POL Chair wrote to Minister Scully on this matter, highlighting that since
1999 POL has convicted a total of 959 postmasters (including the 61 referred to above)
and that if all of these postmasters applied to the CCRC and were successful in the Court
of Appeal POL could be exposed to worst-case compensation claims in the region of
£0.75bn — 0.85bn. This would be unaffordable by POL. Work is ongoing to refine these
estimates and BEIS (incl. PermSec), Ministers and SoS are sighted on the subject.

Governance: Management of the litigation is occupying a significant share of senior
resource within POL and, in anticipation of an increased workload associated with the
Convicted Postmasters, UKGI is working with POL to explore ways in which this can be
managed differently to allow management to focus on running the business.

Compensation Scheme: UKGI is working with POL, BEIS and HMT to explore the
feasibility of setting up a compensation scheme that would be available to postmasters
who may have their convictions overturned. UKGI is also working on a proposal to
separate the management and funding of the ongoing claims from the company’s BAU
activity.

Historical Shortfalls Scheme: On 1 May a Historical Shortfall Scheme was launched
by POL that aims to make payments to postmasters who claim to have suffered losses
as a result of the Horizon IT system (it is not open to convicted postmasters).

Independent Review: Since the new year there has been growing pressure for an
independent, judge-led public inquiry into the Horizon IT ‘scandal’. Instead of this a
forward-looking independent review to assess whether POL has learned the lessons
from the litigation and taken the necessary actions has been agreed, and the draft Terms
of Reference were launched on 10 June. BEIS are now searching for a suitable Chair.
Pressure for the Government on this is still high; whilst we expect it to still be forward-
looking, and from a UKGI point of view challenge how we are monitoring the changes
taking in place at POL, there is the possibility of historical issues, decisions etc. being
looked into and in particular Government's role in them.

BEIS Select Committee: The BEIS Select Committee launched its own inquiry in March.
The first oral evidence session went ahead on 10 March as planned hearing evidence
from affected postmasters, however the second was postponed due to Covid-19. In June
the new Chair wrote to the current and former POL CEOs and BEIS inviting written
evidence, and we suspect the oral session may be rescheduled. We have a good
indication of the potential lines of questioning from these submissions (which are all now
public) and we expect the focus when questioning BEIS/UKGI to be on what information
was known regarding Horizon and by when, what was done about it and how Ministers
were involved throughout.

b) Covid-19 response (high, high):

c) Funding and strategy (medium, high): .
Funding: POL’s current 3-year funding deal expires in March 2021 and we are now ©
working with POL and BEIS on a deal for the period after this date. This requires a .

Spending Review bid to be prepared over the Summer (which given the impact of Covid-

19 is likely to be more significant than people had been expecting before the pandemic). 5
Network Strategy: POL’s new CEO has commissioned a review of the network to make

sure that POL’s strategy in this area is fit for purpose given current customer demand is
patterns, the likely fallout of Covid-19 and the funding available in the Spending Review.
We have encouraged POL to make this as wide-ranging as possible though any

significant changes (e.g. to access criteria) will require a public consultation. b

2019-20 Annual Report and Account

The Comptroller and Auditor General certified the 2019-20 Annual Report and Account
with an unqualified audit opinion without modification on 30 June 2020 and it was laid
electronically in the House of Commons on 2 July 2020.

As part of the audit, NAO carried out an assessment on the impact of Covid-19 on the
accounts and confirmed that there was no material impact on the UKGI accounts.

Advice

The key element of this is ECM and DCM advisers. UKGI has a number of suppliers on ©
standby to provide support, some of which will only bill a nominal £1, others which will
charge full rates. Given the uncertainty over the volume of cases where this advice may ix)
be required, and over which advisers will be used, the cost forecasts are somewhat °
speculative.

Spending review

The SR commission is expected in July with conclusion in October or November. UKGI
is in discussions with HMT central finance team and the sponsorship team on how to
shape the submission. The key objectives for us in developing a funding model are that:

- It enables UKGI to respond to demand signals with reasonable flexibility;

- Income has a high degree of certainty as UKGI/HMT’s ability to manage risk on
its RDEL-Admin budget is very limited;

- There is limited scope for negotiation of costs with clients as this introduces
friction into relationships.

Delivery Risk: Red (No change); Reputational Risk: High (No change)

Litigation was under scrutiny as the Statement of Reasons from the
CCRC was received, the ToR of the independent review were published
and there was media and parliamentary attention. POL’s budget for 20/21
underwent due diligence from KPMG and shows that the financial position
is improving, with no breach of the WCF forecast for the rest of the year.
The waiver on minimum network numbers was extended, but the
geographic access criteria is now being met as closures reduce, despite
there being a reporting issue that had previously understated closures.
The Telco back office contract received shareholder approval, so POL will
soon launch a sale process. The new 10-year Royal Mail contract should
be signed in July. RemCo provided a 19/20 bonus proposal for HMG
approval which has been the subject of debate. POL has begun a
strategic review of its network and service provision to inform a Spending
Review bid.

Topic: Departmental Relationship Review — HM Treasury

Endorsed by: Charles Donald
Ref: UKGI-BP-453

Category: Paper circulated, for discussion

Purpose

This paper has been prepared for information, and to facilitate a discussion of UKGI’s
relationship with HM Treasury (HMT).

Overview

The HMT relationship is unique given its role as UKGI’s parent department, client, and
HMT's interest as an economic and finance ministry across UKGI’s wider projects. There
are extensive relationships from the top down to working level, and the quality of these
relationships, the inherent trust built up, and UKGI’s growing track record in providing
specialist advice not available elsewhere in government, are critical to achieving UKGI’s
objectives.

This paper provides an overview of the relationship, and proposes some key issues for
discussion — namely, maintaining and building the relationship; strategic alignment; the
potential new ‘AssetCo’; and resourcing.

Author: Charles Donald
Ref: UKGI-BP-454
Category: Paper circulated for approval
Summary

Following the Board strategy session on 9 June, this paper sets out how we will monitor
effective execution across the organisation. It is intended to provide the Board with an
understanding of our performance during 2019/20 and the plan for capturing our
achievements during the next year against our three key pillars of governance, corporate
finance, asset realisations; and our people.

I am grateful to Candida Morley, Annie Carpenter, Anna Payton, Tom Banks, Holger
Vieten, Susie Timlin and Julie Price for their input into this paper and help with its
preparation.

Governance

Governance is now front and centre of UKGI’s strategy for 2020/21 and beyond.
UKGI's core objective with our governance assets remains: “to act as shareholder for,
and lead establishment of, UK government arm’s-length bodies, as required in line with
HMG priorities”.

Over the past financial year we have reinforced our reputation as the centre of excellence
in HMG for corporate governance by continuing to build our business and our people
from a strong base. A key part of this included codifying and sharing across HMG our
target shareholder role to enable us to fulfil an effective and proactive shareholder
function for government assets (Figure 1).

Figure 1: UKGI’s target shareholder role ‘O
Our shareholder teams have driven forward the five core pillars (above) of our target role
throughout the year and accomplished some substantial achievements, ranging from 2
bringing about fundamental leadership changes in some of our higher risk assets such ;
as Post Office Ltd to effectively resetting the Departmental relationship and enabling a
more collaborative approach with some of our lower risk assets such as HM Land b
Registry. As requested by the Board, we asked shareholder teams to self-report the top °
three areas in which they felt UKGI had made a difference during the 19/20 year, in
relation to each asset. The full set of those assessments are set out in Annex A. b
The table below shows the range of those 2019/20 achievements mapped across the
five core pillars of the target shareholder role. The breadth of achievements across the 3
pillars shows that our teams have achieved in all areas of our proactive target role but
with 81% focussed across performance, leadership, and governance systems. This is D
encouraging. BS

Although only 7% of our achievements are directly attributed to UKGI’s experienced .
shareholder non-executive Directors, we feel that this is likely to be because the question
asked for outcomes. We know that a strong UKGI NED presence is a key enabler driving By
effective outcomes, but it is not often an outcome of itself. As a result it correlates with
outcomes 1-4 above but is not of itself showing up frequently as a core achievement. b

For next year we may want to consider a slightly different question which can better on)
demonstrate this.
An experienced shareholder NED is a vital aspect of the value we add. We have worked os
hard to maintain a more consistent board member representation within the portfolio,
with 80% of our assets retaining the same UKGI shareholder NED during 2019/20. This
is an improvement on 2018/19 where, in our view, churn was too high where only 62% a
retained the same NED. This will be a metric that we will want to monitor going forward
but we should also note that some churn will be appropriate.
To enable us to continue to capture and monitor our progress in the governance area,
our key metrics for 2020/21 will be: three instances where UKGI has made a a
difference to its assets; and client feedback from our assets and their .
Departments.
. fo)
Corporate Finance .
UKGI’s core objective in relation to corporate finance remains: “providing advice on major ©
HMG corporate finance matters, including HMG financial interventions into corporate .
structures and advising on corporate finance negotiations”.
=
As set out to the Board at the strategy session on 9 June, we plan to restrict pipeline °
development in corporate finance for 2020/21 to focus on resourcing Covid-19 related
Special Situations work and to be ready to cope with any increase in inward M&A activity. fE
We also need to be ready for any ongoing risk as we move closer to the 31 December °
2020 deadline for the EU transition agreement.
x
nd
Our primary metric to monitor effective delivery in this area will be: client feedback from °
the various departments and assets we deal with.

During 19/20, UKGI received positive feedback from a number of our clients, including:

UKGI BOARD MANDATE

UK Government Investments Limited (“the Company” or “UKGI") was formed on 1 April, 2016 to
undertake the activities previously undertaken by The Shareholder Executive and to be the parent
of UK Financial Investments (“UKFI”), whose functions and responsibilities were merged into UKGI
on 1 April 2018. UKGI is wholly owned by HM Treasury (“HMT”) and governed by a Framework
Agreement with HMT dated April 2018 ( “The Framework Agreement”).

The purpose of this mandate (“Mandate”) of the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of UKGI is to
provide guidance to Board members, about our role and responsibilities and the culture and values
of the Board.

This Mandate will be reviewed annually in March of each year.

OUR PURPOSE AND ROLE

The Board is responsible for the stewardship of the Company. We oversee the conduct and affairs
of the Company to ensure that it achieves the objectives set out in its Framework Agreement (the
“Qbjectives”) with HM Treasury, as well as complying with applicable law and regulation. The
overall purpose of UKGI is to be HMG’s of excellence in corporate finance and corporate
governance.

The Board discharges some of its responsibilities directly and others through its Board
Committees and senior management.

The Board agrees, and has collective responsibility for, developing the strategy and high level
priorities of the Company. We track and measure the performance against the strategy and
Objectives. Our strategy consists of the development of specific actions aimed at achieving the
Objectives.

The key resource in implementing our strategy is our people. Accordingly, one of our important
roles is ensuring that senior management is effective in assessing the staffing requirements of
UKGI and then recruiting, retaining and developing our people, as well as ensuring that they are
appropriately allocated to deliver our Objectives.

The Board is responsible for ensuring that appropriate values, ethics and behaviours for the proper
conduct of the Company are agreed and that appropriate procedures and training are in place to
ensure that these are observed throughout UKGI and that reward and assessment includes
measurement against these values.

The Board has discussed and agreed the key values of the Company. We expect the Board and
employees to be Professional, Collegiate, Open and Honest and Outcomes Focused.

The Board is responsible for ensuring that the senior management ensures respect for diversity
across, inter alia, gender, ethnicity, age, nationality and religion by attention to recruiting,
evaluation, promotion and compensation. The senior management will present an annual review
of its diversity plan.

Our responsibilities

The Board recognises that it cannot, and should not, be involved in the day-to-day exercise of the
various activities of the Company and nor to take operational decisions. The CEO, as Accounting
Officer, is responsible for the key operational decisions. The CEO's duties, priorities and objectives
will normally align with the Board’s. When they do not, it is up to the Accounting Officer to act
according to Accounting Officer standards of regularity, propriety, value-for-money and feasibility.

However, as the prudent fiduciary providing oversight of the management of the business, the
Board does have responsibility for:

(i) Ensuring that adequate controls and processes are in place for the proper exercise
of the senior management's day-to-day responsibilities, including controls and
processes to manage audit, compliance and legal risks as well as to manage public
money and the Company's budget;

(ii) Ensuring that people with the appropriate mix of skills and experience are in place
to lead UKGI and meet our Objectives through recruiting, developing, remunerating
and motivating our people;

(iii) Approving the overall strategy and objectives of UKGI:

(iv) Approving taking on significant new mandates;

(v) Approving at least annually the risk register following discussion of the underlying
processes and controls at the Audit and Risk Committee;

(vi) _Assessing the extent to which the management team of UKGI achieves our
Objectives, including delivering corporate finance and corporate governance advice
to Ministers and Departments across Whitehall. The Board will agree the format in
which performance is reported to HMT at the Quarterly Shareholder Meeting.

(vii) Giving its endorsement, when requested to do so by the Chair, CEO or Ministers, of
advice to be given to Ministers. Requests to the Board for endorsement of advice will
be typically about major decisions to be taken by Ministers at key milestones. Such
milestones might include, but are not limited to, the pricing of an initial public offering
or agreement to sale in a private market transaction. This endorsement will typically
be given by the Transaction Committee to which such matters are delegated ( see
below).

(viii) Determining advice to HM Treasury and Ministers on the stewardship of, and
preparation and execution of disposal strategies for Financial Investment Assets,
which include the Government's investments in the Royal Bank of Scotland and UK
Asset Resolution — this responsibility has been delegated by the Board to the
Transaction Committee.

(ix) Endorsing any decision to ask a departmental Accounting Officer to seek a
ministerial direction.

The CEO and other senior UKGI officials may be held to account for advice given to Ministers
when they are called as witnesses to give evidence at Parliamentary Select Committee hearings,
in particular hearings of the Public Accounts Committee (“PAC”) and, in the case of the Financial
Investment Assets, the Treasury Select Committee (TSC). PAC hearings will typically follow
National Audit Office value-for-money reports. In these cases, the UKGI executives will typically
appear in support of the Accounting Officer responsible for the asset, investment or divestment
on which we have provided advice.

Discharging our responsibilities
In order to effectively discharge its responsibilities, the Board should be informed about the

business of UKGI, including transactions and governance projects as well as other corporate
finance and corporate governance advice. Accordingly:

(i) Independent Directors are encouraged to meet with senior management and members
of the project teams outside Board meetings;
(ii) Independent Directors may be assigned to specific project teams. Assignments to

project teams will facilitate the Board’s role in ensuring appropriate risk assessment
and control is in place and that advice is well-considered. The Independent Directors
assigned to a project are expected to challenge, advise and support teams but do not
have responsibility for leading the team or making decisions but, given their expertise
and experience, may exercise influence;

(iii) Independent Directors are encouraged to attend management-led Portfolio and Risk
and Assurance Reviews and to challenge, advise and support the teams in those
reviews;

(iv) I The Board will discuss which transactions, governance roles and other significant
areas of advice merit the Board’s (and where appropriate, Transaction Committee's)
focus and attention and, in some instances, endorsements of advice. The CEO and
senior management, in discussion with the Chairman, will identify the most important
issues as far in advance as is possible so that the Board, or its Committees, can be
appropriately informed about the issues;

(v) The Board will regularly review the main corporate finance and corporate governance
projects to allow challenge, discussion and advice to the teams about the key issues
and risks; The Board and the Transaction Committee would expect over the course of
the year to have conducted deep-dives/full discussion about those roles (governance
or transactions) that are identified as highest risk/impact by the risk register.

Recently appointed Independent Directors will go through an induction process which will include
meetings with senior management as well as a review of the main corporate finance and corporate
governance projects and of the risk register.

Budget, Business Plan and Performance

The Board is responsible for ensuring that effective procedures and processes are in place so that
UKGI discharges its responsibilities to prepare a Budget and Business Plan each year for
agreement with HMT and report on an effective and timely basis to the Principal Accounting Officer
at HMT (or their nominee).

Committee responsibilities

The Board is responsible for determining advice to HM Treasury and Ministers on the stewardship
of, and preparation and execution of disposal strategies for Financial Investment Assets. This
work is delegated to the Transaction Committee. Financial Investment Assets are defined in the
Transaction Committee’s terms of reference. The Board may also, when requested, provide its
endorsement of advice to Ministers or Accounting Officers in relation to other assets or
transactions. Much of this work, particularly for discrete transactions, is delegated to the
Transaction Committee, which will meet as and when required in order to provide this
endorsement. If at any time the Transaction Committee does not endorse the advice, the matter
shall be escalated to the Board.

The Board is responsible for overseeing the implementation of appropriate risk assessment
systems, internal controls and processes to identify, manage and mitigate the principal risks of the
Company's business both as they relate to transactions and Governance roles. Much of this work
is delegated to the Audit and Risk Committee.

APPOINTMENTS, VALUES AND CULTURE
Appointments

The UKGI Board consists of (i) Independent Directors nominated by the Nominations Committee
and approved by the Board and by HM Treasury, (ii) the Shareholder Representative Director and
the Director appointed by a government department, currently BEIS, and (iii) the Chair, Deputy
Chair and Chief Executive who are appointed by HM Treasury. (The Chief Executive is appointed
by Treasury Ministers in consultation with the Chair). All appointments will comply with the
Commissioner for Public Appointments’ Code of Practice for Ministerial Appointments to Public
Bodies and may be subject to regulation as determined by government policy and the legal
framework at the time an appointment is made.

UKGI aspires to be a high performing Board; this means we must appoint Independent Directors
with the skills and experience necessary to achieve the Board’s purpose and with the attributes
and values required to help the effective functioning of the whole Board. The Board explicitly
acknowledges the need for diversity in the composition of our Board. The Board will ensure that
rigourous appraisals of the Board, its Committees and the individual Board members are
conducted. (HM Treasury is responsible for external review of the Chair.)

Values

Each member of the Board must exercise due care and diligence, using the skills and experience
that they have and for which they were appointed to the Board. It is the responsibility of each
Board member to always act in the interests of the Company and play their part in creating the
required open Board culture.

In fulfilling their duties, UKGI Directors are expected to uphold and embody the Company's values
of being Professional, Collegiate, Open and Honest and Outcomes Focused; these values
are the lens through which our decisions and actions should be viewed. The values will be used
in evaluating the effectiveness of the Board and the contribution of all Board members.

These values should be at the heart of every action of the UKGI Board and its Members and of
every decision taken by the Board. UKGI’s reputation and its ethos has been hard earned through
the work over many years of The Shareholder Executive and UKFI, is a key element of the brand
and must be preserved and enhanced. If any material aspect of the Company's business or of any
proposed action does not feel right judged against these values, the view should be expressed at
the Board or, where necessary, privately to the Chairman or CEO for discussion and resolution.

Board Members are expected to comply at all times with “Code of Conduct for Board Members of
Public Bodies” and otherwise observe the points set out in paragraph 6.12 of the Framework
Agreement relating to use of public funds, conflicts of interest, use of information, acceptance of
gifts and hospitality, etc.

Culture ©
Board members have a duty to make their considered views known, even if they are critical or are
expressing an opposing view. They should do this in a way that represents theUKGI's values and b
encourages constructive discussion and solutions rather than conflict, and in a way that respects .
the views of other Board members.

oo
As a Board we accept that things do not always go according to plan in business and we must be .
able to discuss openly difficult issues and plans that have failed in a way that is designed to
improve outcomes. So, whilst accountability must be clear, to encourage this open discussion we a
expect that challenge should be tempered and balanced by support and encouragement.
Directors are expected to take an active role in discussion and decision-making at each Board 7
meeting. To facilitate this, the Chair is primarily responsible for ensuring that the Board has a
culture where openness is encouraged, where disagreement is tolerated and valued, and where
all Board members feel able to raise issues about any relevant aspect of the performance of the %
Company without constraint. As a Board, we respect the different skills and experience we each
have and for which we were appointed and try to ensure that collectively we make the most of O
these talents by listening as well as speaking. .
In support of the required openness at the Board, where it is expected that there will be differences im
of opinion, it is the responsibility of the Chair to bring discussion to a conclusion, decision and 9
agreed action that reflects the views of the Board, cutting through disagreement where required.

remaining on the Action Log. This included: i) the Jupiter private medical insurance issue, for
which work towards a solution was still ongoing; ii) the team’s plans to respond to the new 2020
Stewardship Code, on which the Committee would receive an update at the June meeting; and
iii) on plans to engage with RBS on remuneration metrics, which was planned to begin over the
summer consistent with the usual approach.

provide a Network SGEI i.e. a network of at least 11,500 branches meeting clearly defined access criteria;

take steps to provide the Product SGEI across these branches (e.g. mails, pensions and benefits, banking,

+ UKGI and BEIS have been providing support to POL on its response to the Covid-19 pandemic which has GO BOWS WO GO (od
been having a negative impact on POL's operations and finances. To provide POL with financial flexibility, a 2
security headroom waiver was implemented until the end of June, due to improving forecasts this has not
been extended and the team is monitoring whether there willbe a need for another waiver in August. 2
+ BEIS agreed a three-month waiver on POL's network obligations on 25 March due to the impact of Covid-19

on the Post Office network. The current waiver expires on 26 June, and BEIS with the support of UKGI is
requesting PermSec approval of a further waiver of 6 months with the option for a3 month extension.

+ On the Horizon Litigation, POL agreed a settlement of £57.75m regarding the GLO proceedings on 11 Dec.
The settlement also included other elements aimed at strengthening POU’s relationship with its ieee]
postmasters. POL is still potentially exposed to further claims from the cohort of convicted claimants
(outside the GLO claimants}, as well as other postmasters outside the GLO. POL has launched a
(independently run) Historical Shortfall Scheme to consider claims by former postmasters who believe they
have experienced shortfalls. One BEIS Select Committee hearing has been held with another postponed &
BEIS/UKGI has just responded in a letter to questions being asked by the Select Committee. ‘Tom Cooper

+ A separate litigation case will be heard by the employment tribunal in October 2020, relating to 123
postmasters claiming “worker” status. If successful there are rights that “worker” status would bring,

including holiday pay, pensions and an entitlement to the national minimum wage. This has possible a
financial consequences.

Review of POL's 4 year business plan which is being worked on by POL (deferred delivery due to Covid-19). B

In parallel BEIS policy are working on a long-term vision for the Post Office, which will need to align with this
plan (and inform a bid at the Spending Review).

+ POL’s leadership is in a period of transition due to the departure of key personnel and it is likely that Nick
Read (the CEO) may make a number of hires to build out his senior team, most likely external. Also a risk S
that POL's CFOO may also leave, given he also applied for the CEO role and his 6 month retention bonus has :
vested. "3

+ Negotiations with Royal Mail are progressing positively with both sides targeting an agreement on a new,
non-exclusive 10 year deal imminently. We are engaging closely with POL on this. 2
