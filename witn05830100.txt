                                                       Dated: 10 May 2023


                             POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY




                      FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF ALAN LUSHER




     I, Alan Lusher, will say as follows:


1.     I would like to express my support for the Horizon Inquiry and to offer my full co-

       operation to Sir Wyn Williams in his investigation. I would also like to express my

       sincere sympathy to any subpostmasters ("SPMs") who were badly affected by the

       Horizon project.


2.     To confirm why I am providing this statement, on 25 August 2022 I received a written

       request from the Post Office Horizon Inquiry for me to provide a written statement

       pursuant to Rule 9 of the Inquiry Rules 2006 — Request 1. This Request contained

       21 questions which the Inquiry asked me to address in my statement.


3.     On 06 April 2023 I received a further request from the Post Office Horizon Inquiry

       asking me to provide a written statement pursuant to Rule 9 of the Inquiry Rules

       2006 — Request 2. This Request contained 76 questions which the Inquiry asked

       me to address in my statement.

      with the Rule 9 Request of 25 August 2022 and the second dealing with the Rule 9

      Request of 06 April 2023.

BACKGROUND

5.    I have been asked to set out an overview of my role(s) within the Post Office. To

      assist me, I obtained a list of my roles held during my time at the Post Office which

      I understand was taken from `Success Factors employee record'. This information

      did not cover my job history prior to 1 April 1999 as this information was held in a

6.   My recollection of the exact dates and roles is not clear but the following is to the

     best of my recollection. My employment with the Post Office commenced on 11

     January 1982 and finished on 31 August 2019. My first role was to serve on Crown

     Office Counters. I progressed to work with sub-post offices in the counter services

     department.

                                                                                      WITNO5830100




7.    When I worked in the audit team at postal officer grade (prior to Horizon) I would go

      into the post offices to count cash. Promotion came in approximately 1988, when I

      took the role of Management accountant and then I was promoted again to manage

      the audit team in the Norwich area in approximately 1990. As audit team leader I

      would mostly only attend cash centre audits and conduct audits as part of an

      appraisal process to check the audit teams were doing what they should.


8.    The audit team were referred to as the 'checkers'. When the team went into

      branches, they would complete the equivalent of a weekly account check, in the

      same way that SPMs would. We would take the starting figure, count everything

      coming in and everything going out, look at the stock and then balance the

      accounts. We would then review various processes such as security, and check

      that opening hours were adhered to and properly advertised. I would be physically

      present at those audits when I was audit team leader approximately once a month.


9.    I continued working in the audit team, but covering greater areas — North Thames

      and East Anglia, then the South East area and then part of the audit team which

      operated on a national basis, managing or conducting audits of admin centres, cash

      centres, branch offices and sub-post offices_


10.   Between 2002 and 2003 I was in the Commercial Security team. Almost all of the

      work I did in this team was around cheque fraud. I used to intercept a lot of cheque

      fraud using data from Horizon.


11.   I also had a 2 year period working in `sales' before I moved to the position of contract

      manager between 2005 and 2012 working predominantly in the East, but having

      input to any area as needs dictated. As contract manager, I had responsibility for

                                       Page 4 of 53

                                                                                        WITN05830100




      interviewing prospective SPMs, dealing with contractual issues during the period of

      their contracts and then dealing with suspensions and terminations of contracts as

      required.


12.   Between 2012 and 2019 1 had a role as contract manager but covering a particular

      type of branch. Specifically, I managed the contracts of multiple partners' which

      included businesses such as McColl's, Co-ops and One-Stop. These partners

      managed a large number of branches, so I had contact with the partners'

      management teams but very little contact with individual SPMs. The partners would

      have had their own arrangements for supporting their own Post Office staff. As a

      contract manager it would not have been my responsibility to visit individual

      branches but, occasionally, if a post office was located near to me in my region,

      then I might have been asked to act as a contract advisor and interview a SPM on

      a more geographical basis.


13.   In terms of my qualifications, I left school with 9 "O" levels and 2 "A" levels. While

      working at the Post Office I continued to study and achieved a Master's Degree in

      Business Administration (MBA) in 2004.


14.   Training within the Post Office include a six-week course before serving on the

      counter (pre-Horizon) and a residential management course upon promotion to

      management. On-the-job training was given for all other roles. Besides this, I cannot

      recall anything more specific about my training. I requested a copy of my training

      record from the Post Office in the hope that this information might assist in

      prompting my memory_ However, its only relevance to Horizon is that it shows that

      I completed a day's course on Horizon on 13 June 2003. I believe I would have had

                                                                                     WITNO5830100




      additional refresher training of perhaps a few hours in circumstances where I was

      called on to serve on a counter, for example during strike action by counter staff. In

      all cases this would have been 'user training'.


15_   My career progressed from a `Postal Officer', through to `Contract Advisor'.




ADVICE AND ASSISTANCE


16.   I have been asked to provide an overview of what contact I had with any SPMs or

      managers and assistants working in Post Offices, if any. Before Horizon was

      introduced and when I was working within "Counter Services" I had frequent contact

      with SPMs, visiting their branches and doing such tasks as calculating remuneration

      and allowances, performing audits, and dealing with transaction correction notices.

      I played a supporting role in conducting audits of Crown Offices.


17.   As audit manager, the team that I managed frequently dealt with accounting

      difficulties experienced by SPMs. These were matters arising either as a result of

      them not balancing their accounts, as a result of transaction corrections being

      brought to account or as a result of audits. As an audit manager, I managed the

      audit teams but would not necessarily attend audits myself. My contact with the

      postmasters would therefore have been fairly minimal, unless there was an

      exceptionally large shortfall in the accounts. In that situation, I would be in the

      position to make a decision as to whether to suspend the contract pending further

      investigation. However, in the ordinary course of events, the contract manager

      would make that decision.

                                                                                        WITNO5830100




18.   As contract manager, I engaged in SPM's appointment interviews, dealing with

      general contractual issues, such as opening times, complaints, cash shortages and

      contract suspensions and terminations_ Further information on this is detailed below

      at paragraphs 20 — 28.


19.   I have been asked to describe whether I was responsible for providing SPMs or

      Post Office branches with advice or assistance. Please see above for a description

      of my job roles. The training team was responsible for the initial training of SPMs

      and the helpline was almost always available for advice and assistance_ Online help

      was also available. If the helpline or training team could not resolve a request for

      further assistance, then occasionally a query may have come through to the audit

      team. These were typically straightforward matters which were easily resolved,

      however, if not, the audit team could arrange for a site visit or audit to occur_

      Personally, I would have had very little involvement in this.


20.   When accounting difficulties arose, they were in general dealt with as follows: if the

      discrepancy was minor, SPMs were advised to check all cash and stock on hand,

      along with any vouchers. If their check did not reveal any errors in balancing, then

      they could conclude that there must have been an error in vouchers dispatched or

      input into the account earlier in the accounting period. The transaction correcting

      system was in place so that the various agencies would check returns sent to them

      by SPMs and issue "transaction corrections" to rectify the error.


21.   When there were unexplained accounting shortages, team members would often

      liaise with the accounting department at Chesterfield, or other departments to

      establish whether error notices were due to be issued. The system of rectifying


                                          Page 7 of 53
                                                                                      WI TNO5830100
                                                                                   WITN05830100




      errors could be slow and several weeks may elapse before a discrepancy could be

      corrected in the account. On occasions when there were a number of errors in the

      system, it became complex and sometimes almost impossible to pinpoint the

      causes of a discrepancy.


22.   Either the audit or the contract team could refer disputed errors to the accounting

      team based in Chesterfield who had access to the Horizon system and were very

      helpful in resolving errors and latterly had a champion for difficult cases — Andy

      Winn.


23.   If a cash shortage arose because of failure to correct a discrepancy or any other

      reason, an audit of accounts could be conducted to establish an accurate and

      updated figure. Following any type of audit, SPMs were required to withdraw any

      surpluses or make good losses.


24.   If a deficiency was significant then the contract manager would be called upon to

      consider suspension of the contract of the SPM pending further investigation.


25.   Firstly, the contract advisor would have an initial call with the SPM to establish if

      further resources or training was needed or if they needed to suspend the contract.

      If the decision was taken that the contract should be suspended, information would

      be gathered together from the accounting team at Chesterfield and from the audit

      team who would have provided an audit report. Suspension wasn't an exercise in

      assigning blame, it was done simply to control risk and gather information until such

      time as the issues could be explained and rectified. The contract advisor would then

      have an interview with the SPM and, if the SPM desired, a representative of the



                                      Page 8 of 53
                                                                                         WI TNO5830100
                                                                                       WITNO5830100




      federation of SPMs would also be present to support them (which was normally the

      case).


26.   The purpose of this interview was to establish whether the SPM's contract should

      be reinstated, reinstated with conditions, or terminated.


27.   Depending on the level of the shortage or the nature of the discrepancy, the contract

      advisor would also inform the investigation team. Their investigation would be to

      establish whether there had been any criminal wrongdoing, whereas the contract

      advisor would be concerned with breaches of contract. I never had any direct

      involvement in making the decision as to whether criminality had occurred, even

      when I was working in the Security Team. If the investigation team became involved

      then any contractual decision about termination may have been delayed—If they

      discovered evidence which would be relevant to the contract advisor's decision,

      then this would be shared with the contract advisor.


28.   In my role as contract advisor, I was authorized to make the decision to suspend a

      contract, with my line manager available to consult as required. Terminating a

      contract was not a decision that was taken lightly and senior management was

      always involved in the decision. However, over time, there came to be a number of

      disputed cases in the courts, which led to more senior personnel making the

      decisions about termination. Eventually contract termination was purely a senior

      management decision and not the decision of the contract advisor.


29.   The Horizon system was integral to both the day-to-day transactions and the

      balancing procedure of SPMs. For the vast majority, the system worked well and in

      my own experience, challenges about the system were very rare_ I was unaware of

                                         Page 9 of 53
                                                                                        WI TNO5830100
                                                                                     WITN05830100




      any issues raised by "multiple partners" and cannot recall any questioning or

      suggestion that Horizon was at fault.


30.   If there had been any questions raised subsequent to a particular termination of

      contract, then the whole matter would have gone to the appeal process which was

      conducted at a higher grade and I would not have been involved in this.


31.   I cannot recall raising any concerns and therefore I cannot comment on whether

      there were any steps that I think should have been taken that were not.


32.   I was aware of occasional complaints about the quality of training provided, but I

      believe that the system itself was set up to support SPMs.


33.   I believe there was a very significant training programme for SPMs when the

      Horizon system was first commissioned. I was not part of that process and had no

      direct knowledge of it.


34.   I would have had knowledge of the arrangements for the introductory training of

      newly appointed SPMs after Horizon was introduced. In general, I considered the

      training to be sufficient. In particular, every effort was made to ensure that they had

      received adequate training including follow-up training_ However, after introductory

      training, additional training was very rarely provided for SPMs' staff. You could

      therefore end up with a situation where someone could be running a branch who

      had received no training direct from the Post Office. SPMs would have had access

      to training manuals, the helpline, online resources and the training mode' of the

      Horizon system, in order to support the training of their own staff.

35.    In the initial stages, I cannot recall being aware of any unusual evidence that might

       have given me the sense that the problems were not human error but something

       else. I cannot recall being aware of Fujitsu or any IT people coming in to sense

       check the issues but that does not mean it didn't happen in some cases — just that

       I was unaware of specific incidents of that nature.


      TRAINING


36.    All SPMs were offered initial training. Some of the training was conducted in the

       classroom and some on-site as the Post Office was in operation. The training team

       also conducted follow-up visits to ensure new SPMs were confident using the

       Horizon system, particularly in the balancing procedure. In addition to this, support

       was available to the SPMs online using the Horizon training mode, from the Helpline

       and from trainers or visiting officers, who would attend the branch in person if

       warranted. I should point out that the entire training regime was managed by a

       specific team and therefore I relied on that team to monitor training, provide the

       training and ensure that it was sufficient. Only in unusual circumstances would a

       contract manager become involved in training matters, for example, to require that

       additional training be stipulated as a condition of contract reinstatement.


37.    If anybody felt that they were not confident in using Horizon, additional training could

       be arranged and often the Federation of Subpostmasters and neighbouring

       subpostmasters would be pleased to provide support and assistance, particularly

       for new SPMs.


38.    SPMs were offered initial on-site and classroom training. The number of training

       centres available for classroom training was reduced, which resulted in some


                                           Page 11 of 53

                                                                                    WITN05830100




      people deciding not to take up the offer of this training because of the associated

      travel commitment.


39.   Horizon could also be switched into a training' mode, allowing the individual to

      explore the system and gain confidence in using it.


40.   It would be normal that a new SPM would not only be taking on the Post Office, but

      also a retail business. Their retail business was often more significant to them than

      the Post Office, and the individual could be training for both at the same time. On

      such occasions, effective Horizon training time whilst the trainer was on-site could

      be limited. This problem could only be resolved by providing training before the

      transfer of the business, or additional training after. This was not always easy to

      arrange because of the commitments of the training team.


ERRORS OR ISSUES WITH HORIZON SYSTEM


41.   My only recollection of direct involvement with an allegation that the Horizon system

      may have been the cause of discrepancies was in or around 2006-2008, specifically

      with the matters arising at the Rivenhall branch. I recall the SPM's suggestion that

      the discrepancies were caused by the system. These events took place many years

      ago and therefore my active memory of them is not comprehensive. It is possible

      that if I were provided with additional documentation relating to this case, that

      elements of it might come back to me.


42.   I do recall that, following an interview with the SPM, Mr Ward, I sent out a staff

      member, Mandy Lawless, who had been a branch office manager and was




                                     Page 12 of 53
                                                                                            WI TNO5830100
                                                                                          WITNO5830100




       considered to be an expert in using the Horizon system. She attended the site to

       discuss the issue with the SPM but she was unable to substantiate his concerns.


43.     Subsequently the local federation representative and then a neighbouring

       federation representative also got involved to see what they could do to help resolve

       things but they were also unable to substantiate his concerns.


44.    As part of the investigation into Rivenhall, I referred the matter to the accounting

       department at Chesterfield and would have discussed the matter with my line

       manager. I'm aware that the head of the accounting team, Andy Wynn, was involved

       to help clarify the reason for the losses. It would not have been my role to

       understand the technical issues behind any concerns about Horizon. I believe,

       though I am not certain that it would have been Andy Wynn's responsibility to raise

       any potential technical issues either internally to the manager responsible for liaison

       with Fujitsu, or himself directly to Fujitsu. I was not party to these arrangements but

       I was aware that the case had been considered by the right people within the Post

       Office.


45.    After the termination of the contract at Rivenhall, the entire case was considered

       again under the appeals procedure by a senior manager and the termination was

       confirmed.


      RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES


46.    I have been asked to explain whether I was involved in or party to any disputes

       between the Post Office and SPMs regarding any shortfalls of money. Please see

       paragraphs 20 — 28 above. I could have been involved with such discussions

                                          Page 13 of 53
                                                                                      WI TN05830100
                                                                                   WITNO5830100




      between 2005 and 2019, although, my only recollection of such disputes where the

      integrity of Horizon was at stake is in relation to the Rivenhall branch. Please see

      paragraphs 41 — 45 above.


47.   Whilst I was aware that senior management had meetings with SPMs about the

      difficulties being experienced with Horizon, I remained unaware of the nature or

      detail of these discussions.


48.   As described in paragraphs 20 — 28 above, I was involved in the resolution of

      various disputes, mainly about cash shortages, but also about other issues, such

      as customer complaints or adherence to opening hours. Disputes about the

      accounts would sometimes prompt an audit being carried out at the branch and a

      subsequent interview as described above. An appeals process was in place if the

      SPM was unsatisfied with the outcome. This would involve an experienced and

      specially trained senior manager who would hear the case afresh to arrive at an

      independent decision.


49.   The accounting team at Chesterfield, who had access to the Horizon system, were

      very helpful in resolving disputes arising from accounting discrepancies and I

      believe that they would have had the responsibility of ensuring that technical IT

      issues were raised with Fujitsu-if appropriate. Disputes directly involving Horizon

      were dealt with by the Post Office legal team and senior managers.


50.   I cannot recall ever being involved in contacting or receiving input from Fujitsu at

      any stage in the resolution of any disputes. This was not a direction of enquiry open

      to me in my role but would have been available to others involved in the process. I



                                     Page 14 of 53
                                                                                        WI TNO5830100
                                                                                      WITN05830100




      believe the account team at Chesterfield could obtain historic data from Fujitsu

      relating to individual branch accounting disputes.


51.   As far as I am aware, Horizon was thought by the Post Office to be a totally secure

      system. In retrospect, if there had been a more detailed analysis of IT issues, they

      might have discovered something at the time but this was not within my sphere or

      scope of responsibility.


52.   In other respects, the system provided the environment for open discussion with

      SPMs, who often called on the Federation of Subpostmasters for support.


53.   There are no other matters that I consider the Chair of the Inquiry should be aware

      of However, the events took place many years ago and my active memory of them

      is therefore very limited.

      06 APRIL 2023 — RULE 9 OF THE INQUIRY RULES 2006 — REQUEST 2


APPOINTMENT OF SUBPOSTMASTERS


54.   I held the position of contract manager between 2005 and 2019 and during this time

      I had responsibility for interviewing prospective SPMs. I have had sight of and

      reviewed, the following documents:


       a) Brief summary of certain sections of the subpostmasters contract" (17

          December 2004) (POL00088903);

       b) Template letter "Assessment for the position of subpostmaster" (August

          2005) (POL00088900);

       c) "Agency Recruitment Policy" (version 0.1, October 2008) (POL00005670).


55.   I have been asked to describe the process for the selection and appointment of new

      SPMs. I can recall that there were various changes and enhancements to the

      processes for the selection and appointment of SPMs. Although I was involved in

      these processes between 2005 and 2019, my recollection is no longer very good

      relating to specific processes at any point within that timeframe.


56.   As an interviewer there were also changes in job title, for example, Contract and

      Services Manager, Contract Manager, Commercial Contracts Manager, Contracts

      Advisor. These are titles which all applied to the same or very similar role, so for

      simplicity, I will refer to all as Contracts Advisor unless there is a specific reason to

      differentiate.




                                       Page 16 of 53
                                                                                             WI TN05830100
                                                                                           WITNO5830100




57.   I cannot recall specifically the titles of teams involved in the selection process in the

      timeframe specified, but in general terms, I believe there was a central team based

      in Chesterfield, latterly known as the Agent Recruitment Team, who would send out

      documents to applicants. The Contract Advisor would conduct the interview,

      perhaps with a note taker, or using electronic recording equipment. For larger

      branches, it was not unusual for two Contract Advisors to interview.


58.   In terms of how vacancies were advertised, normally, applications would come

      from people who were in the process of buying a retail business from the incumbent

      SPM. If there were no applications from this source and the Post Office was facing

      potential closure, then a member of staff would search the area and ask for

      applications from suitable businesses.


59.   In relation to the documentation that an individual was required to submit as part of

      their application, I cannot be specific to the timeframe, but in general the applicant

      would have to supply a completed application form and a business plan, along with

      the evidence of identity / right to work in the UK document as specified in the

      invitation to interview letter.


60.   In terms of how applicants were assessed during interview, the right to work and a

      satisfactory criminal record was confirmed, the business plan would then be

      assessed for viability and a competence framework was completed by way of a

      formal discussion. The Contracts Advisor was responsible for conducting

      interviews.


61.   I have been asked to confirm whether contractual issues were discussed during the

      interview and, if so, the details of any discussion and in particular, whether

                                          Page 17 of 53
                                                                                       W ITNO5830100
                                                                                    WITN05830100




      successful applicants were given the chance to review their contract or a summary

      of the key points before they were appointed. In answering this question I refer to

      document POL0088900 which has a brief summary of certain sections of the SPMs

      contract which was sent out by the central team as part of the invitation to attend

      an interview. This summary of key points of the contract would be discussed at

      interview. Security, for example, would always be discussed, due to its importance

      for the safety of the SPM and staff as well as the protection of Post Office funds and

      the contractual position regarding cash or stock losses would also always be

      discussed.


62.   The Contract Advisor was responsible for deciding whether the vacancy would be

      offered to the applicant.


63.   The successful applicant would then receive a pack of documents either delivered

      at the time of the transfer by the audit team, or sent by the central administration

      team in Chesterfield. This pack would include key documents, for example, an

      inventory of Post Office property, a document for them to sign up to the Official

      Secrets Act and the full contract.


64.   In terms of what measures were in place to ensure consistency in the selection of

      SPMs for appointment, Contract Advisors would be trained by sitting in on

      interviews with more experienced colleagues before carrying out any interviews

      themselves. As well as initial training, I can remember an 'away day' devoted to

      training using professional actors as applicants, but I cannot be sure that this was

      within the timeframe referred to. For larger branches, two contract advisors would

      sometimes conduct the interview.

      CONTRACTUAL LIABILITY OF SUBPOSTMASTER FOR SHORTFALLS


65.    I have had sight of and reviewed the following documents:


           a) "Losses and gains policy within the POCL agency network" (version 1, 20

              November 1998) (POL00088904) (in particular paragraph 3.1);

           b) "Post Office Ltd — Security Policy: Accounting losses policy for agency

              branches" (version 1, February 2003) (POL00086845) (in particular,

              section 1 and section 3);

           c) "Post Office Ltd — Security Policy: Liability for losses policy (for agency

              branches)" (version 1.7, September 2003) (POL00088867) (in particular,

              section 1 and section 3);

           d) "Post Office Ltd Losses policy — overarching (branches)" (version 9,

              effective date April 2006) (POL00030562) (in particular, section 2).


66.    I have been asked to confirm what my understanding was when I worked for the

       Post Office of the contractual position as to the responsibility of SPMs for shortfalls

       or `losses' identified within their branch. My understanding is summed up in the

       sections of the contract which stated that "the subpostmaster is responsible for all

       losses caused through his own carelessness, negligence or error and also for all

       losses caused by his assistants. Deficiencies due to such losses must be made

       good without delay."


67.    I have been asked to confirm how the Post Office policy on the responsibility of

       employees within the Crown Offices for shortfalls or `losses' identified in a Crown

       Office differ from the policy on the responsibility of SPMs for shortfalls or 'losses'

                                          Page 19 of 53
                                                                                      WI TNO5830100
                                                                                    WITN05830100




      identified within their branches. However, I did not have a role in the enforcement

      of losses within the Crown Office Network and therefore cannot comment on this.


THE AUDIT PROCESS AND THE POLICIES/PRACTICES IN PLACE


68.   From the mid-1980s, I was a member of the Audit Team, carrying out audits as a

      Postal Officer. This would involve me conducting audits of sub post offices either

      by myself or as part of a team for larger branches. I left the audit team for a time,

      but re-joined as manager of the team in the Anglia region, later expanded to the

      North Thames and East Anglia region.


69.   The role then varied further as part of the team based nationally, to include, for

      example, the scheduling of audits. However, the main thrust of the role remained in

      the management of the cash centre, branch office and sub office audits.


70.   I believe all activities were governed by policies, which we periodically reviewed for

      improvement. However, I cannot recall the names of policies or the dates of any

      changes.


The audit process


71.   I have been asked to review the document: document "Losses and gains policy

      within the POCL agency network" (version 1, 20 November 1998) (POL00088904)

      (in particular, "Appendix D — Process for losses and gains at Agency Outlets"). I can

      confirm that I have reviewed this document.




                                     Page 20 of 53
                                                                                         WI TNO5830100
                                                                                       WITNO5830100




72.   I have been asked to confirm whether I was familiar with this policy when I was part

      of the Audit Team and, despite the passage of time, I can recall some of the

      document. I believe that the document was produced at a time when the various

      regions of the post office had a degree of autonomy. However, I do not know if this

      was produced in North Thames, East Anglia, another region, or was a national

      policy.


73.   I do not recall that there was any difference in the role of the audit team before or

      after the introduction of Horizon. Advice given, either by the audit team or the

      helpline, would be to re-check cash, stock and vouchers on hand and try to identify

      the source of the misbalance in records of documents dispatched.


74.   An audit would not normally be conducted on the report of a misbalance, as the

      audit could prove nothing more than what was possible by a careful re-check of the

      balance. The audit team would also be able to make checks with Financial Accounts

      Department (FAD) in Chesterfield, later known as the Product and Branch

      Accounting section (P&BA), to find out if a recent error had been detected in the

      branch submissions.


75.   Audits would normally be programmed to take place periodically. This was,

      however, dependent on the size of the branch, and generally between every one to

      three years. There would also be audits conducted within the first 3 months of

      service, following robbery or burglary incidents or at the transfer of a branch to a

      new SPM. A small number of random audits were included in the programme. Risk

      modelling was used increasingly to take into account factors such as the value of




                                         Page 21 of 53
                                                                                    WI TNO5830100
                                                                                 WITNO5830100




      cash held and the history of losses and errors at the branch in order to prioritise

      branches for audit.


76.   When Horizon was introduced, the only change to the Audit's Team role was a

      change to the process in that, where it was necessary to use accounts information

      from the branch, this would be obtained from the Horizon system, rather than the

      previous paper-based system. After my time with the audit team, the roles of

      trainers and auditors were merged.


77.   I have been asked to confirm whether I am aware of any other policies which were

      in place when I worked within the Audit Team governing the audit process. I can

      recall that the process of completing an audit would be documented, as would be

      the process for selecting branches for audit. In the earlier days of the period in

      question, the audit team were also responsible for the monitoring of losses and the

      administration of some of the error notice system as well as the administration of

      "former subpostmasters' accounts", which involved the resolution of discrepancies

      for SPMs after they left a branch. Each of these areas was covered by documented

      policies.


78.   I have been asked to confirm what sources of information I would expect an auditor

      to have considered when completing an audit (pre and post the introduction of

      Horizon) and whether these sources varied according to the type of audit being

      conducted. I can recall that the basis of an audit consisted of two elements: the

      verification of cash, stock and vouchers, and the inspection of compliance to laid

      down procedures.

79.   In order to verify cash, stock and vouchers, the auditor would obtain a starting figure

      from the office account, whether paper based, from the Horizon system or from

      other various systems which were in use before the introduction of Horizon. Cash,

      stock and vouchers would then be physically counted to arrive at a balance. After

      the audit, some figures from the office account could be verified, for example the

      value of any remittances sent from or to the branch could be checked against the

      records of the cash centre. Other information would always be checked by other

      agencies or departments in the normal error checking process.


80.   Calculations would be completed to check that stock holding levels were reasonable

      compared to sales, and that overnight cash holdings were within target.


81.   The checking of "vouchers" refers to withdrawals or deposits from or to various

      sources — for example the National Savings and Investments (NS&I), or one of the

      banks.   Over time, the number of paper vouchers decreased as digital input

      increased. Fundamentally, nothing about the audit changed with the introduction

      of Horizon except for the source of some information at the branch.


82.   When looking at compliance, the auditor would be looking to check a number of

      records in the branch, for example to ensure a record was kept of visitors to the

      branch and a record of alarm testing. They may check that leaflets and posters on

      display were current and that opening times were correctly advertised.


83.   If the audit was conducted to establish a loss following an incident of robbery or

      burglary, then some of the checks may have been dispensed with.

84.   With the exception of transfer audits and those conducted following a robbery or

      burglary, audits were conducted unannounced. On arrival at the branch, the auditor

      would obtain access to the Post Office cash, stock and records and the SPM and

      staff would be prevented from accessing these or the Horizon system.           The

      expected plan for the audit would be communicated to the SPM and the person in

      charge if the SPM was absent. The branch would be closed to the public for the

      minimum amount of time and generally not for the full duration of the audit. Note

      that if the SPM was absent, they would, if possible, be contacted to inform them

      that an audit was being conducted at their branch.


85.   I have been asked to confirm what further enquiries or investigations an auditor

      would undertake if they discovered a discrepancy or a shortfall during an audit. At

      the branch, provided proper records had been kept, it was normally possible to

      check most of the information entered into the audit account. For example, cash

      could be checked against the record of the previous overnight cash holding record,

      stock could be checked, albeit approximately, to the last stock levels recorded by

      the branch and many vouchers would still be on hand at the branch. The SPM or

      officer in charge would normally be on hand to answer questions from the auditor,

      especially dealing with matters of local knowledge, but a formal interview would be

      a part of the investigation process and not carried out by the audit team.


86.   Further checks of records would take place following, or during an audit by making

      telephone enquiries. For example, branch records could be verified against records

      of cash and stock received or dispatched with the cash centre, or daily vouchers

      dispatched with the accounts department in Chesterfield or the various agencies.

                                                                                         WITNO5830100




      Some of these checks could not be undertaken at the time of the audit, as some

      items might be in transit.


87.   After the audit was completed, in the case of larger discrepancies, the case would

      be passed to the line manager for consideration of precautionary suspension

      pending investigation and to the investigation team to consider any criminal

      aspects.


88.   If a discrepancy or shortfall was discovered, SPM's were able to provide their own

      information or undertake their own investigation. It would be normal practice to

      discuss any discrepancy with the SPM or person in charge and sometimes this

      would prompt their memory and result in a resolution. They should always have

      been invited to check the figures in the audit account.


89.   In the more serious cases where a SPM's contract had been precautionarily

      suspended, then he or she would be invited to interview with the Contract Advisor

      and / or the investigator. I have never been involved with the investigation interviews

      conducted by the investigation team, so cannot comment on them, but when

      interviewed by a Contract Advisor, the SPM would usually be accompanied by an

      officer of the National Federation of SPMs. This interview would be conducted as

      soon as reasonable after the precautionary suspension to allow time for information

      to be gathered and at this interview, all aspects of the case would be discussed and

      every opportunity given for the SPM and their representative to provide any

      information for consideration.


90.   I was aware of auditors being given instructions on taking payment from SPM's to

      make up any shortfalls. Payments could be taken and a receipt given. I believe it

                                         Page 25 of 53
                                                                                    WI TNO5830100
                                                                                  WITN05830100




      was also made clear that this payment would be accepted without prejudice to any

      further action to be taken by the Post Office.


91.   Any audit would be generally performed with the branch being closed to the public,

      and therefore with an urgency to have service resumed as soon as possible.

      Therefore, discussions with the SPM would normally be brief whilst the assets were

      checked by the auditors. Once any discrepancy had been established, then the

      SPM would be invited to check the account and input any local knowledge.


92.   In terms of what processes were in place which allowed a SPM to raise issues or

      concerns during an audit, if any issues or concerns were raised by a SPM during

      an audit, auditors were encouraged to simply note any issues raised, but not to

      question. The audit report would contain a summary of any issues or concerns

      raised by the SPM. Any general issues or concerns would be raised with their area

      manager! sales manager.


93.   There was no involvement with Fujitsu at any stage in the audit process.


94.   In terms of whether there was any variation between the audit process in respect of

      Crown Office branches and other branches, broadly the process was the same for

      the verification of assets. However, the check of compliance to procedures differed

      because the Post Office employed a manager to ensure ongoing compliance, so

      the audit checks were less.

      MY ROLE AND THE POLICIES / PRACTICES IN PLACE RELATING TO ERROR

      NOTICES, TRANSACTION CORRECTIONS, TRANSACTION

      ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS AND BRANCH DISCREPANCIES


95.     I have been asked to confirm my involvement in and the policies / practices in place

        relating to error notices, transaction corrections, transaction acknowledgements

        and branch discrepancies. Within the audit team error notices were received from

        various agencies, such as NS&I, and would be sent on to the sub post office to be

        brought to account. These would have the effect of rectifying errors made and the

        resultant shortage or surplus would be made good or withdrawn as appropriate. I

        cannot recall whether "transaction corrections" were introduced at the same time

        as the Horizon system, but these had the same effect as error notices — it's just that

        they were delivered electronically to the SPM's Horizon system.


96.     I do not recall what a transaction acknowledgement was.


97.     When a SPM found a discrepancy in the account at some stage and depending on

        amount, these were reported to the audit team.


      Error notices, transaction corrections. transaction acknowledaements and branch

      discrepancies.


98.     I was asked to considered the following policies:


            a) "Losses and gains policy within the POOL agency network" (version 1, 20

               November 1998) (POL00088904) (see, in particular, the table under

               paragraph 3.1);

      b) "Debt Recovery Processes under Branch Trading" (October 2005)

          (POL00085794);

      c) "Post Office Ltd Losses policy — overarching (branches)" (version 9,

          effective date April 2006) (POL00030562) and appendices 3 ('Process for

          awaiting TC (Transaction Correction) — Multiples' at POL00083951) and 4

          ('Process for awaiting TC (Transaction Correction) — Singletons' at

          P0L00083952);

      d) "Transaction Corrections Process Review for Agency Branches" (version

          6b (draft, October 2007) (POL00039024);

      e) "Operating Level Agreement: Product & Branch Accounting, Network and

          Service Delivery" (version 1.0, March 2009) (POL00039089);

      f) "Operators' In Service Debt - Operators' Lifecycle Issue - Policy issue 8" (1

          January 2012) (POL00113670);

      g) "Policy Document — Postmasters' In Service Debt" (version 2.0, 4

          December 2012) (POL00090357).


99.   I can confirm that I have reviewed these documents.


100. Prior to the introduction of Branch Trading an error notice was designed to enable

      the SPM to make an entry in the branch account to reverse the effect of an earlier

      entry made in error. For example, if a deposit of one hundred pounds was entered

      in error into the branch accounts as one thousand pounds, then when the office

      account was balanced, it would be found to be short by nine hundred pounds. The

      error notice would reverse this effect by crediting the account with nine hundred



                                    Page 28 of 53
                                                                                         WI TN05830100
                                                                                       WITNO5830100




      pounds, creating a compensating surplus at the next balance of account. An error

      notice was sent to the branch by post.


101. After the introduction of Branch Trading a transaction correction was the electronic

      equivalent of an error notice. As stated above, I do not recall what a transaction

      acknowledgement was.


102. Error notice or Transaction Corrections ("TC") were issued when a discrepancy was

      identified between the branch account and other evidence. This evidence could be,

      for example, a customer receipt or an entry in a bank book. It would take some

      investigation to establish which entry was correct, but then an error notice or TC

      would be issued to reverse the effect of an original error.


103. Error notices were issued by the accounts department in Chesterfield or the various

      agencies, such as NS&I. They were sent to the audit team so that they could be

      recorded and then sent out to the relevant branches. TCs were electronic versions

      of error notices, but would be sent directly to the branch, bypassing the audit team.


104. An error notice would normally be brought to account and the resultant discrepancy

      made good or withdrawn. It could be challenged and an explanation sought. The

      amount could also be posted to the suspense account, which would have the effect

      of declaring that the notice was in the account, but that the resultant discrepancy

      had not been dealt with.


105. In order to continue trading, TCs had to be brought to account and the resultant

      surplus or shortage made good or withdrawn. I note from document POL0039024

      that discrepancies less than £150 should have always have been withdrawn or

                                         Page 29 of 53
                                                                                 WI TNO5830100
                                                                               WITN05830100




     made good, but a dispute process could be invoked for larger errors, giving the

     opportunity for further investigation and allowing the SPM to bring any new

     evidence. The process was dealt with by the central accounting team.


106. In terms of the process that a SPM was expected to follow if they discovered a

     deficiency or surplus in the amount of cash held when balancing a branch, the

     contractual position was that surpluses should be withdrawn and shortages made

     good without delay.


107. If the SPM was expecting an error notice, discrepancies could be posted to

     suspense. I believe permission from the retail Network Manager was required for

     this and that there were time limits to avoid amounts being held in suspense

     indefinitely. It was not considered to be good practice to simply "roll over" a

     discrepancy in the hope that it would come good at the next balance of accounts.


108. When Branch Trading was introduced, Document POL00085794 indicated that

     £150 was considered the minimum amount for a deficiency before a SPM was able

     to "settle centrally". Generally, in my work, I was less concerned with smaller

     discrepancies, so I am not familiar with the actual position in relation to their

     settlement.


109. The Inquiry have informed me that they have received evidence that as part of the

     IMPACT programme, which involved the introduction of a new end to end

     accounting process via Horizon, the local suspense account which had previously

     been available to SPMs was removed. I have been referred to the witness

     statement of Susan Harding at WITN03980100, paragraphs 23 to 32 and also to

     the following documents:

         a) `Losses and gains policy within the POCL agency network' (version 1, 20

             November 1998) (POL00088904) (see, in particular, section 1, part 2

             `Authority To Hold Losses In Unclaimed Payments');


         b) ii) `Post Office Ltd — Security Policy: Accounting losses policy for agency

            branches' (version 1, February 2003) (POL00086845) (see, in particular,

         c) 'Post Office Ltd — Security Policy: Liability for losses policy (for agency

            branches)' (version 1.7, September 2003) (POL00088867) (see, in

             particular, section 3 — `Authority to Hold Losses');


         d) The letter at page 2 of NFSP00000169;


110. I can confirm that I have reviewed these documents.



111. I have been asked to explain what role the local suspense account played before

     its removal. The role of the local suspense account was to account for any

     unclaimed payments or receipts uncharged to the account. The suspense facility

     would also enable shortages or surpluses to be declared, but not made good or

     withdrawn. For example, if the balance of account showed a shortage, this could be

     entered as an unclaimed payment, which would have the same effect as adding it

     to the cash on hand, negating the shortage. With permission, the facility could be

     used legitimately to hold discrepancies for up to 8 weeks, usually whist awaiting an

     error notice. The facility was replaced by the debt resolution process.



112. By October 2005 (the date of the guidance "Debt Recovery Processes under

     Branch Trading" at POL00085794), it is correct that the only option open to a SPM



                                         Page 31 of 53
                                                                                        WI TNO5830100
                                                                                     WITNO5830100




      who received a TC which they did not understand, or wished to challenge, was to

      call the NBSC helpline.


113. This would result in either a satisfactory explanation being given so the TC would

      be brought to account; evidence that the TC was incorrectly issued resulting in a

      compensation; TC being issued; or the dispute process being invoked which would

      result in the amount being held in a separate account whilst further investigations

      took place. This is referred to in document POL00085794.


114. It is correct that, if the SPM could not provide information at the time of the call to

      the helpline to show that the TC was issued incorrectly, the SPM was required to

      "Accept and Settle Centrally" whilst a further investigation took place. However, I

      was not involved in this process.


115. It is correct that, if a SPM identified a discrepancy which they considered to have

      been caused by a system error, the only option available to them was to call the

      NSBC helpline and seek agreement of Product and Branch Accounting to "settle

      centrally" while the matter was investigated. This was the process in respect of any

      disputed discrepancy. Separate to the NSBC helpline, there was also a dedicated

      "Horizon Helpdesk".


116. I have been asked whether "settling centrally" signifies acceptance of debt liability,

      as is suggested in the document dated 14 November 2008 entitled "TC/Debt

      Recovery Review" at POL00001404. My understanding of the way the process was

      used in practice is that settling centrally was an acceptance of debt liability, unless

      the dispute resolution process was invoked, which would stop the debt recovery

      process pending further investigation_

                                      Page 32 of 53
                                                                                           WI TNO5830100
                                                                                         WITN05830100




117. I would like to point out that the "settle centrally" facility was used routinely by

      branches managed by the "multiple partners". This enabled the partner to settle the

      discrepancies for all the branches they managed in a single settlement to the Post

      Office.


118. There was not anything to distinguish a disputed debt from an undisputed debt and

      I cannot see that the policy or the contract made any distinction.


119. At the time, the contractual position in respect of losses was clear and the SPM was

      responsible for all kinds of losses whether caused by carelessness, negligence or

      error and losses of all kinds caused by assistants.


120. To avoid any confusion around the term "settle centrally" I would like to explain that

      the term was often used to describe the action of clicking on the button to accept a

      TC. Clicking this button then led to options of either accepting liability to pay money

      into the account, or to raise a dispute. If the SPM disputed a TC, then there was a

      process in place to investigate the error without the need for immediate settlement.


121. On that basis I found it satisfactory that SPMs were required to click the button to

      "settle centrally" even if a TC was disputed as immediate payment was then not

      required and a delay enabled time for enquiries to be made and any proof to be

      provided. I still consider this to be a satisfactory system of bringing to account TCs

      even if disputed. It is only in the light of the findings of the court case that it has

      been found that the process of investigating any dispute has been found inadequate

      in relation to finding Horizon system errors.

122. I would agree that the process for challenging TCs / TAs discrepancies meant that

     a deficiency or loss was assumed to be the result of carelessness, negligence or

     error caused by the SPM or any staff employed.


MY ROLE WITHIN THE COMMERCIAL SECURITY TEAM


123. During my short time within the Commercial Security Team, my role was to reduce

      losses to the Post Office caused by weaknesses in product security. There may

     have been minor involvement with other products, the detail of which I cannot recall,

     but my main task was to look at cheque encashment fraud.


124. In order to do this, data was downloaded daily from the relevant system which would

     show the account number of all encased cheques across the Post Office network.

     This data must have originated from the Horizon system, but I was able to download

      it. I cannot clearly recall whether I has download access to Horizon, but I believe

      there was another computer system which came between my download and the

      source of the data. Multiple encashments from a single bank account could be

      identified, which could then be further investigated. This system enabled many

     fraudulent encashments to be stopped. I do not recall any fraud being perpetrated

     by SPMs or Post Office staff, only by dishonest members of the public.


125. I had no concerns during this time about the reliability of Horizon data. The data

      was verified by the counterfeit cheques which were gathered in.

                                                                                         WITNO5830100




   "CORRECTIVE ACTION" TAKEN AGAINST SPMs, SUSPENSION,

   TERMINATION AND APPEALS


126. My permanent roles within the Post Office are described above, but on some

     occasions, I covered, without additional pay, the role of the contract advisor line

     manager. On occasions in this role, I would be contacted by a Contract Advisor,

     should they wish to discuss a potential suspension. I would always have the option

     of discussing any decision with another Contract Advisor line manager, or other

     senior manager, if necessary.


      "Corrective Action" taken against SPMs


127. I can confirm that I have reviewed the memo dated 15 February 2006 entitled

     "Corrective Action for agents — Process, Timescales and Letters" (POL00083945).


128. Where any accounting errors which generate transactions corrections were

     identified, a member of staff, either a trainer or a visiting officer, would be sent out

     to the branch to provide training or support in the balancing process. The National

     Federation of Subpostmasters were often very helpful, particularly in providing

     coaching and support to new SPMs. On occasions full days of additional support

     from a trainer could be arranged.


129. It is not correct that it was assumed that SPMs who were receiving "[frequent]

     transactions corrections" were those "yet to embrace the changes and challenges

     the business faces". I believe the corrective action process sought to reduce the

     cost to the Post Office of frequent errors. This was a separate issue to helping to

     bring about the cultural change to proactive selling of products by SPMs rather than

                                         Page 35 of 53
                                                                                      WI TNO5830100
                                                                                   WITN05830100




      just providing service to customers. The support provided in cases of frequent errors

      are listed at point 36. Remedial action to encourage active selling was likely to be

      coaching and training from the Sales Account Manager, supported by the Contract

      Advisor (Contract and Services Manager as referred to within POL00083945.) I

      recall few cases coming through to the Contract Advisors, which focused on

      reluctance of SPMs to sell products.


130. In relation to paragraph 3.4: "Precautionary Suspension and Summary

      Termination", in the absence of "evidence of dishonesty", I have been asked to

      confirm what kind of "material breach of the contract for services would justify such

      action." I can recall that breaches of the contract for services which could lead to

      precautionary suspension or summary termination could be cases where

      carelessness, negligence or error were evident or where losses were caused by an

      assistant.


131. I do not recall having any involvement with "corrective action" against Crown Office

      staff. I therefore cannot recommend on how the process differed from the process

      applicable to SPMs.

132. I can confirm that I have reviewed the following documents:

         k) "Guiding Principles for Suspension" (2 November 2012) (POL00086116).


133. I have been asked to confirm what a contract manager's / contract advisor's role

     was following the discovery of a discrepancy or shortfall during an audit and what

     process was followed when an auditor's report was provided to them. When a


                                      Page 37 of 53
                                                                                       WI TNO5830100
                                                                                    WITN05830100




      shortfall in a branch account was discovered by the audit team of over £1,000, then

      an auditor would make contact with a Contract Advisor who would then, in

      consultation with their line manager, make a decision on whether to suspend the

      contract to give time for further investigation, or to allow trading to continue based

      on information provided.


134. If the deficiency was less than £1,000 this would be highlighted in the audit report,

      but not brought to the immediate attention of the Contract Advisor.


135. In circumstances where a discrepancy and/ or shortfall was identified, the situation

      changed over time as to who was responsible for deciding whether a SPM should

      be suspended. For a long time, the Contract Advisor would consult with a senior

      manager before any decision was made. As awareness of Horizon difficulties

      increased, any such decision was taken at senior manager level.


136. In relation to how an individual responsible decided whether or not to suspend a

      SPM, I recall the "Guiding Principles for Suspension" document, ref POL00086116

      and my understanding is that this was designed to be an aid memoire for Contract

      Advisors to assist them in their decision making. This document would be taken into

      consideration, along with information provided by the audit team and any other

      information available. Before the decision was taken, there would always be

      consultation between the Contract Advisor and their line manager.


137. If the precautionary suspension was due to account shortages, the SPM would

      normally be informed by telephone at the time of the audit, and this would be

      confirmed by letter shortly afterwards.



                                     Page 38 of 53
                                                                                         WI TNO5830100
                                                                                       WITN05830100




138. The decision to make a precautionary suspension pending investigation would be

     taken by the Post Office and I do not believe there was any process for the SPM to

     make representation about that decision. However, it would often be the case that

     the Contract Advisor would speak to the SPM at the time of audit and before the

     decision to suspend was taken. At that stage the SPM could bring forward any

     matters for consideration.


139. As to whether SPMs were remunerated for the period of their suspension,

     remuneration would normally be withheld_ Direction for this process is outlined

     within the contract, but I do not recall the detail.


140. In terms of who was responsible for deciding whether a SPMs contract should be

     terminated where a discrepancy and / or shortfall was identified, once the decision

     to precautionarily suspend a contract was made, evidence would then be gathered

     to enable a meaningful interview to take place where all aspects of the case could

     be discussed. In some cases, the interview could be conducted a few days after the

     suspension of the contract, but this was dependent on what information needed to

     be gathered. As with the decision to suspend the contract, a senior manager,

     normally the line manager of the Contract Advisor would be consulted before a

     decision to reinstate or terminate the contract was made.


141. At interview, evidence would be heard from the SPM and the Contract Advisor.

     The SPM would usually be accompanied by a friend — often a representative of the

     Federation of Subpostmasters. Whilst that "friend" was not permitted to formally

     represent a SPM, they could be useful to both parties in helping to clarify any issues

     relating to day-to-day transactions in the branch. The Contract Advisor would


                                          Page 39 of 53
                                                                                  WI TNO5830100
                                                                                WITN05830100




     present the report from the auditors and any other information which was relevant

     to the case.


142. Prior to the interview the Contract Advisor may consult with the accounts

     department and the security team if a criminal investigation was being considered,

     as well as any other relevant agency. Before a decision was taken on whether to

     re-instate the contract with or without conditions, or to terminate it, a senior

     manager, usually the line manager of the Contract Advisor would always be

     consulted_


143_ If the decision was made not to terminate a SPMs contract after they had been

     suspended, they would be informed of the decision not to terminate as soon as

     possible and of any conditions to the re-instatement. Provided any conditions were

     met, the branch contract would be reinstated. If the branch had been closed since

     the precautionary suspension, then it would be re-opened as soon as practicable

     and if it had been transferred to a temporary SPM, then a transfer back would be

     arranged.


144. As I recall, a SPMs contract could be terminated without notice in cases of

     bankruptcy, abandonment of service or death of the SPM.


145. SPMs did not have the right to appeal against the decision to suspend them. The

     decision to precautionarily suspend pending further investigation was made by the

     Post Office based on evidence available at the time.


146. The SPMs did, however, have the right to appeal a decision to terminate their

     contract. Appeals were heard only by specially trained senior managers. I recall

                                   Page 40 of 53
                                                                                     WI TNO5830100
                                                                                   WITN05830100




     taking notes during appeals before it was common practice to record the appeal

     interview using an electronic device, but as I never achieved the status of senior

     manager, I never had input into the decision making.


147. Although I was never involved in deciding on a SPM's appeal I am aware that the

     appeal hearing was regarded as a completely fresh review of all the evidence and

     every opportunity was given for the SPM to present their case.


148. The SPM was invited to present their case and had the opportunity to make

     representations before the appeal was determined.


149. I cannot recall any changes to suspension, termination or appeal that were brought

     about by the Network Transformation Programme.


150. Asa user of the policies, I may have been consulted on any revisions over a number

     of years. My only specific recollection is in helping to revise process to do with

     appeals and to provide assistance in the training of appeals managers as indicated

     in the document POL00086828 — "Subpostmasters Appeal Panel Process review".


151. In relation to what approach was taken to termination of contract decisions when

     criminal or civil proceedings had not yet been resolved, any criminal proceedings

     would take place independently to the contractual process. Civil proceedings would

     be started as part of the "Former Subpostmasters Accounts" process, so would not

     be commenced until after any debt was established and the termination process

     completed.

RECOVERY OF AGENTS' DEBT


152. I can confirm that I have reviewed the following documents:


      a) "Losses at SPSO's: Guidelines on responsibilities and recovery

         arrangements" (understood to be issued in 1988) (POL00083939) (see, in

         particular, paragraphs 15 to 28);

      b) `Losses and gains policy within the POCL agency network' (version 1, 20

         November 1998) (POL00088904) (see, in particular, sections 3 and 4 and

         appendices D and K);

      c) Working agreement — "Finance Service Centre and Network" (version

         2.12, undated) (POL00088897) (see, in particular, paragraph 3.7);

      d) "Fraud & Conformance Team Handover Document" (3 March 2012,

         revised July 2012) (POL00002086)_


153. I have been asked to explain my role and that of contract managers / contract

     advisors more generally in relation to recovering debt from current and former

     SPMs. As regional audit manager, I was involved with recovery of debt from serving

     and former SPMs. The process was to write to SPMs explaining the contractual

     position and the reason for the debt. Repayment plans were offered and if recovery

     proved to be impossible, then the cases were passed up to more senior

     management for consideration of write-off or to be passed to the legal department

     for their input.

                                                                                       WITNO5830100




154. POL00088904 indicates Retail Line Managers and Heads of Retail Network took

     on these responsibilities when regions existed, although I believe the audit team

      played an administrative role in monitoring losses.


155. Although I cannot be sure of dates or their exact role, Contract Advisors also

      became involved in the process. I believe any write-off authority given to Contract

     Advisors was later withdrawn and applied only to senior managers.


156. I have been asked what involvement contract managers / contract advisors had in

     decision-making relating to agent debt being dealt with by the Financial Services

     Centre ("FSC") after a SPM had opted to "settle centrally". The FCS would deal with

      providing information and evidence of any debt. The Contract Advisor would be

      involved in recovery of the debt.


157. I cannot recall any detail around any other teams within the Post Office which were

      involved in the debt recovery and branch conformance.


158. I can confirm that I have reviewed the following documents:


          a) "Losses and gains policy within the POCL agency network" (version 1, 20

             November 1998) (POL00088904) (see, in particular, section 5 and

             appendices J and L);

          b) "Post Office Ltd — Security Policy: Accounting losses policy for agency

             branches" (version 1, February 2003) (POL00086845) (see, in particular,

             section 4 and section 5);




                                          Page 43 of 53
                                                                                        WI TN05830100
                                                                                       WITNO5830100




      c) "Post Office Ltd — Security Policy: Liability for losses policy (for agency

          branches)" (version 1.7, September 2003) (POL00088867) (see, in

          particular, section 4 and section 5);

      d) "Post Office Ltd Losses policy— overarching (branches)" (version 9,

          effective date April 2006) (POL00030562) and appendix 5 "Process for

          seeking relief on losses — singletons" (POL00005816),


159. It can be seen from these documents that responsibility for the recovery of losses

      changed over time, with audit, the retail line and Contract Advisors being involved

      at various times and in various ways.


160. I recall that "write-off' could have been considered for accounting losses if the SPM

      was within the first 6 weeks of service and in cases of exceptional hardship. The

      earlier document POL00088904 describes more factors which Retail Network

      Managers and Heads of Retail Network could consider, which included accounting

      cases where evidence was not conclusive. Document POL00005816 refers to

      distressing circumstances which an Area Performance Manager may take into

      account when considering write-off. I was not involved in decisions taken by these

      managers.


161. I am unaware of the frequency of debt write-off for SPMs.


CIVIL CLAIMS AND OTHER DEBT RECOVERY PROCEEDINGS


162. I have been asked in what circumstances were civil claims I other debt recovery

      proceedings brought on behalf of the Post Office to recover debt from current or

      former SPMs. If debt recovery had been unsuccessful, after write off criteria had

                                                                                      WITN05830100




      been considered and repayments plans discussed, then cases were passed to

      either senior managers or the legal team to decide whether to further pursue the

      debt_


163. I was not involved at any time with the recovery of debt from Crown Office

      employees and can therefore not answer any questions in relation to this.


   CASES AGAINST SPMs


164. I have been asked what, if any, recollection I have of the following criminal cases:

          y) Ann Neild


165. I have no recollection of any of the above listed criminal cases, with the exception

      of Suzanne Palmer and Allison Henderson.


Suzanne Palmer


166. The Inquiry have provided me the following documents: POL00068275;

      P0L00068277; P0L00068278; P0L00068281; P0L00068280; P0L00068282;

      P0L00068283; P0L00068575; and P0L00068581.


167. I have provided a witness statement in relation to Suzanne Palmer's bankruptcy

      case on 03/04/2023 and therefore my memory of the case has been at least partially

      refreshed. I was not involved in the criminal case against Suzanne Palmer, but

      would have supplied information to the security investigation team if requested to

      do so, but I have no specific recollection that any such request was made to me.

                                                                                           WITNO5830100




   Allison Henderson


168. The Inquiry have provided me with the following documents: POL00025670;

      P0L00025672; P0L00044501; P0L00046853; P0L00044900; P0L00047152;

      P0L00047235; P0L00054285; and P0L00054422.


169. The documents provided remind me that an audit was carried out at the Worstead

      branch of which Allison Henderson was SPM revealing a shortage in the account

      of £11,957.78. I invited Mrs. Henderson to interview to decide on the future of the

      contract for services, but before that interview took place, Mrs. Henderson resigned.

      The security investigations team requested a witness statement from me, which I

      supplied and is document POL00047235 dated 20 September 2010. I had no further

      involvement with any criminal proceedings.


170. I have been asked whether there are any prosecutions that I had a role in that I

      consider are relevant to the matters being investigated by the Inquiry. I was never

      involved with the security investigations team and my only involvement in any

      criminal cases was to provide information to them, or on a very limited number of

      occasions, a witness statement. I was not involved in criminal cases, other than to

      provide statements or information.


171. I have been asked what, if any, recollection I have of the following civil actions:


      a) Aslam Ramtoola

             GRO
       c) Kevin Palmer

       d) Rachel Williams

                                                                                   WITNO5830100




   e) Frank Holt

   f) Susan McKnight

   g) Tracey Etheridge

   h) Katherine McAlerney

   i) Keith Macaldowie

   j) Lee Castleton

   k) Julie Wolstenholme


172_ I was involved with deciding on the future of contracts for services, not any civil

     action. I take "civil action" to mean the recovery of debt. There are no civil actions

     that I had any role in, or that I would consider relevant for this inquiry.


KNOWLEDGE OF BUGS, ERRORS AND DEFECTS IN THE HORIZON SYSTEM


173. I have considered the correspondence at POL00073790 and POL00105278. These

      documents describe a situation around a discrepancy found at an audit in April 2008

     at The Grange Post Office branch whilst Kevin Palmer was the SPM. It was to do

     with accounting for lottery scratch cards. It appears that there was confusion about

     the correct way of accounting for scratch cards and as a result Kevin Palmer was

      left with a shortage to make good. The case was sent to Andy Winn in the accounts

      department in Chesterfield to clarify as he had the expertise and access to the

      records needed. He wrote to Mr Palmer in October 2012 with an explanation

     POL00105278.


174. As a Contract Advisor I was aware that the system used for accounting for scratch

      cards was the cause of a disproportionate number of errors, but I have no reason

      to believe that this was caused by any bugs, errors or defects in the Horizon system

                                      Page 48 of 53
                                                                                           W I TNO5830100
                                                                                         WITNO5830100




175. At the time of the introduction of the system and consistently throughout the time

      when groups of SPMs were questioning the robustness of the Horizon system, my

      colleagues and I in the contracts team were assured of its complete reliability. I was

      assured that the Horizon system was not capable of causing discrepancies. I

      considered the system as reliable in reporting discrepancies in the account. I was

      also assured that if the system stopped working due to an interruption in the power

      supply, everything was recorded, so would be brought back when the supply was

      restored.


OTHER MATTERS


176. It has come to light that decisions in which I have been involved in the past may

      have been based on incorrect information obtained from the Horizon system. It has

     subsequently been found that the Horizon system, on which I relied, has been found

     to be less reliable than I was assured it was. I would like to express my sincere

     apologies to anybody who may have been affected unjustly_
