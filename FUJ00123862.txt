10. ARCGENREP0004.HorizonDataIntegrity.doc

A document I produced 3 years ago year describing the Integrity of Horizon.
11. Modes.xls

Info on Modes

See below for more info

Where indicated they are described further below.

1721.Products.xIsx

Main cols to consider:
1. Action: If Action = E, then this indicates Product is to be withdrawn

2. E: Effective data: Indicates the data at which this becomes effective. There
may be multiple rows for the same column with a different date. I suggest for
simplicity you ignore any such cols unless Action = E

3. G: Prod No (also in B). This is the value to do a look up on from the
transactions

4. H: Type of product
5. I: Product Name

Other cols may be of interest, but I won’t go through them all now. Main use is G
and I.

Prod 0 XML _Anal.xls

Key sheet is “Branch Opening Balances”.

If you paste in the Horizon XML lines into col A, then the formulae in cols C to L
will extract the value of the attribute in row I into the corresponding cell.

This particular extract was produced having extracted all rows found containing
“<ProductNo>0</ProductNo> from a Horizon raw dump. These rows show the
Opening Balance (is sum of cash, value stock and currency) at balance time for a
Branch.

It relates to the Misra case, but the point of including it is to show the analysis
technique if it is of use.

Modes.x1s

Main cols to consider:
1. A: Numeric Mode (as used in HNG-X transactions)
2. B: Acronym (used in Horizon extracts)

3. C: “No” indicates Mode is not used in practice

FUJITSU RESTRICTED (COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE)

4. D: Description of the Mode. NB “Remit” means items moving into or out of
a Branch. Transfer means items moving between Stock Units in a Branch.

Note HNGX has merged 4 & 5 and only uses 4 for all Revaluations and also 16 and
18; and 17 & 19. HNG-X also uses 14 for “Transfer Acceptance” rather than Bulk
Input.

Modes 29 onwards all relate to Transaction Corrections initiated by Post Office Ltd.

The following gives the values for Entry Mod

Barcode Scanner
1 Keyed
