Journey to the WG and Scheme

+ Ministerial commitments following SS Report set out broad way ahead.
+ PO/JFSA/SS designed the Scheme and published details

+ WG established and agreed its ToRs (not published)

+ What changes could be made within existing ToRs?

+ Ministerial commitments relatively broad - some scope for change

+ Published Scheme but can be varied BY WG

* Under TORs for WG PO would need agreement of WG to change - experience to date
shows reluctance to do so

Therefore:

* if PO asks for change what happens if WG refuses?

* where does that leave us?

* would we be prepared to force the issue and break the WG?
