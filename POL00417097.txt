Further to our discussion on Monday, Ed Davey has said that the JFSA should be
invited in to meet him. He took this view on the basis of the 20 July letter from JFSA
and the briefing on the expected C4 news item and without further advice from me.
The meeting is unlikely to take place before early September, due to diary and holiday
constraints. Ahead of this meeting it would however be helpful to have POL
comments/factual responses on the claims and allegations made in the 2 JFSA letters,
on the cases on the JFSA website and on the cases raised by Alun Michael MP and
Jenny Randerson AM (Ed Davey's reply to these last letters will refer to having invited
the JFSA to meet him)

Sorry to add to heavy workload.
Regards

Mike
