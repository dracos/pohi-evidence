1. Introduction

This note is provided as input to a Witness Statement regarding Gaerwen.

2. What I’ve Done

Penny Thomas provided me with extracts from Audited Data for 3 separate periods.

T have taken this Data and extracted details of all Banking Transactions and analysed
the zero value transactions. The following table provides a summary of the data that
has been analysed:

460 19/05/2005 | 27/05/2005 _| 407 47
Totals 1804 236

I have produced a separate

Transactions.

Each Spreadsheet has the following Columns:

Counter Position that the Transaction took place on

User logged in at that Counter

<Time:

Transaction Time in GMT

<SaleValue:_| Amount of the transaction (always zero)

<TranType: _| Transaction Type (see table below for meanings)

<RespCd: _ | Result of the Transaction (see table below for meanings)

The “<TranType:” column indicates the Type of Transaction.
are used in the 3 spreadsheets with the meanings shown:

01 Balance Enquiry — Mag Stripe

03 Cash Withdrawal — Mag Stripe

04 Cash Withdrawal with Balance — Mag Stripe
06 Change PIN — Mag Stripe

61 Balance Enquiry — Chip and PIN

62 Cash Deposit — Chip and PIN

63 Cash Withdrawal — Chip and PIN

64 Cash Withdrawal with Balance — Chip and PIN
65 Cash Withdraw Limit — Chip and PIN

following Types are used in the 3 spreadsheets with the meanings shown:

01 Authorised OK

03 Declined - Invalid PIN

04 Declined - Insufficient Funds

06 Declined - Usage Violation (amount)

08 Declined - Other

23 Failed by Fl: Unexpected Resp Code

26 Fail by Fl: System Unavailable - Return Card
32 Failed by Agent: Fl Timeout

In all cases where the Response was “Authorised OK” (152 transactions), the
Transaction was either a Balance Enquiry or Change of PIN (Transaction Types 01,
06 or 61), where no Cash is expected to have changed hands.

Response Codes 03, 04, 06 and 08, indicate that the Financial Institution has decline
the Transaction, and so no Cash should change hands.

Response Codes 23 and 26 indicate an unusual Response from the Financial
Institution and again no Cash should change hands.

Finally, Response Code 32 indicates that Horizon’s Central system has received no
response from the Financial Institution within a timeout period, and so no Cash should
change hands.

All these are perfectly normal occurrences and should result in clear instructions
being passed to the Counter Clerk to ensure that no Cash should change hands.
