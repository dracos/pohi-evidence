We would be grateful if you could review this extract and provide any comments which you may have. If there are any

Re Pleading 21 and our meeting on 22 June when you requested a summary of what “Horizon “does”, I am.
pleased to attach a summary broken down into service line activity.

I trust that this addresses your question albeit in a slightly different manner possibly than you may be
expecting, due to the complexity of the service supply.

Best regards,
Chris
