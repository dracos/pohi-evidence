17) Whether, when there were discrepancies between trial balances generated by Horizon and

‘other arrangements are agreed’.

disputed amounts centrally, (albeit collection was in some cases suspended, apparently

disputed amounts because of the limitations on their ability to access, identify and
reconcile transactions recorded on Horizon and the lack of any or adequate report-writing
features in Horizon.
