Introduction

This is the functional High Level Test Plan for S81. It defines the tests to be
performed of the functional changes introduced as part of that release.

Scope

The scope of the testing covered in this document is determined by the general
strategy in relation to business integration testing performed by ITU SV&. This is
defined in [2] and [3] but the objectives can be summarised as:

- To test that the changes introduced to Horizon at a given release meet the
requirements defined in relation to those changes.
- To confirm that the Horizon solution has not regressed as a result of
introducing the changes.
The strategy for ITU SV&I business integration testing also stipulates two
fundamental principles underlying the testing:
= The testing is done on (in so far as is possible) a 'live-like' test rig
- The testing can be characterised as ‘integrated’ (i.e. covering the interaction
between the various components of the Horizon solution, e.g. counter, agent
and host). This means, for example, that in a test which generates a transaction

at the counter, that transaction is tracked from the counter to all extemal
interfaces (e.g. TIP gateway) from which it leaves Horizon

General

The following table shows the Change Proposals and PEAKs implemented at S81 and
covered in the functional tests defined within this document.
