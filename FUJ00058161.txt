Managing Directors Summary

1 SUMMARY

® March has been a heavy month with the focus of attention on the
completion of integration and test for the early releases within the new
Implementation Plan. Extra resources were focused on this area and
the workload pressure has been high and good results have. been
achieved, although the programme remains on critical timescales.

« A major breakthrough has been. the resolution of the migration issue to
the satisfaction of both PDA and the sponsors. This has been achieved
without increased costs on ICL Pathway. We have however still to
find a way forward to overcome the lack of counterspace-available in
much of the Post Office network. As we approach the next delivery
programme at the end of April, this issue is rapidly getting to the top
of the agenda and will require quite difficult-escalation before an
acceptable resolution is fouind.

° Good:work has been done on méasuring counter transaction times
which are fundamental to our sérvicé level agreements. The work
here is looking encouraging and:so far we are on course to come in
within the set limits.

¢ IGL continues to run satisfactorily with a steady card population now
of just-over 1,500 card users.

e Animportant ‘Away Day’ was held between ICL Pathway
management-team and the PDA management team to explore how we
progress in terms of openness and trust on this demanding
programme. No stunning breakthroughs but a glimmer on improved
understanding.

° Considerable attention has been given. duririg the month to staff
appraisals and also to constructing an improvéd method of reviewing
and éstablishing the terms of contract arrangements for the substantial
freelance community. This latter has work has been pushed through
vigorously and will prove of long term benefit to ICL Pathway.

¢ Arrangements are in hand for meetings with POCL and Bull to discuss
how we engage with them both on the technical and architectural
implications of supporting the post office Government.direct initiative
{Genesis 2] which is due for piloting in the summer of 1997.

Managing Directors Summary Date: 14/04/97

2.2 CAPS MIGRATION

© Release 1a was successfully implemented over the Easter weekend, the
work went well.and continues to run OK. This enables the new
version of CAPs 2.0 to intercept our system and prepare the way for
later releases.

2.3 OBCS

e This is the Release. 1b due for implementation at the end of April.
Testing has moved on rapidly from system test into direct interface
testing arid into Model Office Rehearsal and Trial, which-is now well
advanced. We fully expect a final signoff and successful
implementation on time.

2.4 CHANGE CONTROL FOR-THE REPLAN EXERCISE

e This has now reached an advanced draft and should be signed off by
all parties fairly quickly. Care is being taken to ensure that we
preserve our rights should there be any further delays in the CAPs
programme and to ensure that the CAPs migration plan, when firm,
allows us to argue all relevant impacts on our direct.costs.

2.5 BPS RELEASE

e This is Release 1c due for.implementation at the end of June. ‘This has
been badly“impacted by a late Riposte baseline release’ which has
caused between two and three weeks delay. We aré sharing our
recovering plans with the PDA and will shortly have to determine the
likely impact on scheduled dates. It also causes a knock effect on
Release le due to the compressed timescales between these releases. A
satisfactory outcome ’is'the critical piece of work for April.

2.6 CONTRACTUAL ACCEPTANCE

e¢ We have made good progress in preparing the ground for the
acceptance process and also agreeing the functional requirements for
the CAPs 3.0 Release and the Pathway Release 2 product scheduled
for January 1998.

2.7 FRAUD AND RISK MANAGEMENT

¢ Good progress over a wide range of issues. The main concern is that
the, subject of extended verification procedures [EVP] which we had
thought was buttoned down a month ago has reopened with a major
escalation from the sponsors.

2.8 QUALITY

e A second EFQM review has been held across ICL Pathway which
records significant progress over the last fifteen months. As before an
action list involving all directors has been created to take the next
phase forward.

2.9 INTERNATIONAL PROSPECTS

e Escher have begun work with Australia Post and there are éarly signs
that we may need to get involved. A design study for Deutsche Post
now has been accepted and key meetings will take place with ICL
ParhWay later in April. The Japanese Ministry of Post and
Telecommunications [MPT] have visited us through their agents
Numera Research Institute who were impressed with what they have
seen and want to return again later in the summer. Singapore Post

” have accepted their pilot system and rollout is now under way.
Support to the ICL.Singapore project now comes from our
development group and this.appears to be satisfactory to all parties.

3 CURRENT CRITICAL PROBLEMS

3.4 COUNTER SPACE

° As we survey the first 200 offices the extent of this problem is
becoming clearer and worse. We have formally lodged with PDA that
the Post Office network is not fit forthe purpose of automation and
that this responsibility clearly lies with the sponsor. Difficiile
negotiations must be anticipated.

3.2 RELEASE 1C FOR BPS

¢ We have critical areas concerning‘access control and reconéiliation
which must be resolved and agreed before signoff for this Release can
be achieved.

Managing Directors Summary Date: 14/04/97

3.3 TEST RIGS FOR RELEASE 1C AND 1E

© Multiple releases have created serious bottle necks in the building and
availability of test rigs to allow parallel testing to proceed at the speed
necessary. Actions have been taken to résolve these bottlenecks by
drawing in extra resources and the next few weeks will tell us how
successful this has been.

3.4 RELEASE 2 BASELINE WITH CAPS 3.0 PRODUCT

e Lining up these two releases is critical for the ability to pay multiple
benefits from January 1998. Final agreement on this synchronisation
is needed within the next few weeks.

3.5 SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS FOR NORTHERN IRELAND

e Our encryption arrangements for data traffic in Northern Ireland:has
been deemed unacceptable to the sponsors although it is acceptable
elsewhere in the UK. This remains.unresolved.

3.6 PUBLIC AWARENESS CAMPAIGN

e We have a major issue with the.sponsors‘on the customer:education
activities where we are planning to communicate the introduction of
the payment card and the impact this has on the general public. BA
want us to take this much further to explain the implications benefit
by benefit. This is further exacerbated by the provisional benefit
migration plan which spreads the transfér of benefits to cards some 12
months later than anticipated. This issué is certain to run for some
time yet.

4 ISSUES

4.1 PHASED MIGRATION

e There are a series of difficult technical and logistic issues to resolves in
terms of moving forward from the'staged releases. In particular
Release 1b to Release 1c is proving problematic.

Managing Directors Summary Date: 14/04/97

4.2 BENEFIT MIGRATION

e We still have not received the change request for thé new:benefit
migration programme and following on from this how we recover
increased direct costs.

4.3 ISDN COVERAGE

e This now needs to be escalated to BT to determine the extent of the
problem before settling on how to cover the gaps in the network,
either via satellite, frame relay or use of PSTN. facilities.

4.4 NEW POCL PRODUCTS

¢ The process for-agreeing new product requirements with POCL has
become extended and there is a need to accelerate agreement here such
that new products and hence new revenue streams can be intercepted
at a Release 3 product for late Spring 1998.

4.5. EXTENDED VERIFICATION

« The fact that this issue has come back on the table again is bad.news
and indicates that PDA are not.controlling their sponsors adequately
and keeping them informed and disciplined.

5 COSTS
© Project spend has increased this month as the workload on
development and testing has become more complex and involved.
Action is being taken to tighten down the cost base as far as: we
possible can but the true way forward has got to be to exploit this
sophisticated infrastructure to leverage off more-revenue and. business
to bring the returns and profitability to:a higher level.

Programmes Report

1 MONTHLY SUMMARY

e March was a crucial month for-the Programme, we successfully intercepted
CAPS.2 in IGL, moved into Model Office testing for the OBCS release due to
be rolled out in April and plannéd to make significant progress with system
testing the BPS and full EPOSS releases due to be implemented in June and
September respectively. Unfortunately, the latter did not occur due to reasons
explained later and I now anticipate a difficult time with the Sponsors in
April as we struggle to meet our testing deadlines.

© The.dévelopment, testing and.integration staff continue to work long hours
under considerable pressure but to their credit their commitment and
enthusiasm remains. A successful implementation of the OBCS release on
April.28" will do much to maintain morale.

© We resolved the migration issue which threatened to increase our
implementation costs but have still to find an acceptable solution to the
limited counter space issue. ] am concerned that BT are failing to implement
ISDN across the UK in the expected timescales. Observers believe that they
could be as much as 2 years.behind schedule which could obviously have.
serious implications on our roll out plan.

e The functional requirement for the CAPS3/Pathway Release 2 is still not
agreed but development work has commenced in order to meet the deadlines.
There is a small risk that rework will be necessary ifthe sponsors introduce
changes at the last minute.

e We are working with Bull to determine the architectural and technical
‘implications of supporting the Genesis 2 Project (Government Direct) during
the July/August timeframe. The plan currently is to use our infrastructure only
so as'to minimise the impact-on Pathway Acceptance Procéss. Agreement with
the sponsors to relax the acceprance criteria in those post offices chosen for
the pilot is essential if with are to actively participate.

« Despite a few problems during the Easter weekend the migration from CAPS
1 to CAPS 2 was successfully achieved. The new service is running well with

very few technical problems.

e The Order Book Control System (OBCS) successfully navigated business
integration testing, direct interface testing and model office rehearsal with
only a handful of hardware/software issues identified and fixed. We remain
confident that this release will be implemented on April 28" as planned.

¢ At the beginning of March, it became apparent that a new version of Riposte
had to be installed to satisfy the functional requirement. Due to a series of
technical problems, this unplanned activity took the whole of March to
successfully build and integrate. This combined with the conclusion that the
Benefit Payment Release (BPS) required more technical infrastructure than
original planned, conspired to seriously hamper progress. The additional
effort spent on BPS had a knock impact on the EPOSS release schedule but
the current view is that the size of the task has been reduced because some of
the infrastructure work has been brought forward, consequently it should be

possible to recover the lost time.

¢ The Business Requirement Definitions (BRD) for the Mails and Eftpos
products continuc to be revised and reissued but time is running out if they
are to be included in Release 2. We are close to agreeing the CAPS 3 interface
requirements but it has been necessary to commence development to maintain
the deadlines. This carries some risk of rework if changes are introduced at

the last minute.

3 CURRENT CRITICAL PROBLEMS

¢ The delays associated with the BPS and EPOSS releases must be recovered if

we are to avoid a major confrontation with the Sponsors.

¢ The number of Post Offices with restricted counter space is significantly
greater than we have been led to believe. From an initial view of roughly
3000 we could now be faced with 10000 which require considerable

modification to house the equipment.

© Sign off of the functional baseline for the BPS release has been delayed due to
problems with Access Control and Reconciliation, Every effort is being made
to satisfy the customers expectations.

4 ISSUES

© The phased release strategy has created additional migration problems.

© The data centrés do not have the space contingency originally specified in the
plans. This must be rectified.

¢ The Audit requirements are open to interpretation, this may cause us
problems during the Acceptance Process for Release 1.

e Agreeing thé process for introducing new business requirements for POCL is
proving more difficult than anticipated.

e British Telecom are behind schedule with the installation of ISDN within the
UK. This in turn will impact the Pathway roll out strategy.

e We have run into problems with Post Offices which are not served by ISDN
i.e. those in remote locations and mobile offices. Energis are evaluating the
alternatives such as PSTN, frame relay, satellite etc

¢ The Riposte system.is designed to operate with. two Correspondence Servers
but only one has been installed with the IGL and OBCS systems. Plans are
now in place to introduce two.servers into live operation for OBCS.

1 MONTHLY SUMMARY

© The Replan is not yet put to bed. The Change Request has been agreed in
draft form but not yet submitted to us for formal approval. There is a risk
that DSS may yet balk at two conditions, both of which have been
acknowledged in writing by the PDA. These are (i)that each of the new
release delivery dates for CAPS into Pathway (now split into various releases
aligned to the Replan and identified as CARs) remain milestone dates (delay
to which would shift all subsequent contract dates to the right day by day),
and (ii)that the revised CAPS Migration plan (delayed switch from books to
cards) be subject to a separate Change Request which will reimburse us for
additional direct costs incurred as a result of the changes. We may have to
escalate quickly.

2 PROGRESS

© Replan is agreed in all significant respect except for the above points
© Migration approach agreed in outline, in principle, at no additional cost
e Scorecard mapping to MIS - a significant task

¢ Amount of change still required for Release 1 rapidly reducing - specifically
Escher

© Counter transaction times method and results crystallising - mostly
encouraging

Significant headway on limiting the customer education exposure (generic
versus benefit by benefit)

© Fulfilment subcontract agreed

© Change control process initiated for Replan with all major sub-contractors

2.3 EXTERNAL, WITH PDA

e CNT - mostly focused on the Replan but also increasingly acting positively to
broker movement on contentious issues where progress has stalled. Their
resolution usually involves a commercial component. Customer education is
one example now making headway. Counter space is the next major item to
be addressed. The principle that counter space should be “fit for the purpose
of automation” has been tabled and (subject to minutes confirming) accepted
by the PDA contracts team. On Acceptance, the PDA contracts team has in
principle agreed that the PDA should propose any additional tests they wish
to see performed to show compliance with the Service Schedules (as opposed
to Requirements) - rather than their insisting that we. should do Acceptance
tests by both criteria (the previous position held at operations level).

e JCCB (Joint Change Control Board). Subject to our providing adequate
supporting explanation for additional costs, particularly where these are of a
one-off nature, we have been givén assurance of timely approval in future. It
is clear that a degree of delegated authority has now been given to the PDA to
approve at least low level CCNs. Whére we seek changes to the Scorecard to
recover additional operating costs, timely approval is likely to be much more
difficult. We have the JCCB’s commitment to using all reasonable endeavours
to fast-tracking CCN117 (significant Requirements changes to DSS
functionality proposed for Release 2) as a “Red Star Priority” item. We have
notified the JCCB that work has started in anticipation of approval (there has
been a great deal of prior discussion) in order to hold Release.2 timescales
but that failure to confirm the CCN (including Scorecard changes) by 16"
April would indeed put Release 2 at severe risk.

e Finance,and Commercial Forum - mostly housekeeping - working well:

¢ Acceptance team joint.sessions (Jim Morley leading for Commercial) -
progress being made but

¢ Multiple phone conversations with Pat Kelsey on the Replan, CAS (DSS are
still crying to sidestep.any responsibility despite the CAR on them to facilitate
resolution), on contentious issues as above, and generally to smooth paths
wherever possible (eg. EVP. and Access Control “agreements to agree”).

2.4 EXTERNAL, WITH POCL, DSS

© Finance and.Commercial Forum - alternating POCL, DSS, POCL etc. The
main value added feature of the POCL forum is early qualification of
prospective POCL new business. This is going slow and is becoming a
¢oncern. POCL client managers are under pressure to reduce costs from their
clients: they are on the defensive. For no change ‘in style-of transaction and
no change in client process, counter automation represents unwanted
additional cost. Without business reengineering end to end with the clients
active involvement, this is bad news for them, and they are fighting it.
Grasping the opportunity to reengineer will take new attitudes and heavier
weight account managers. We may have to take more concerted initiatives at
senior level within POCL to change the mindset.

© DSS equivalent body is at.this stage. concerned only about audit trails, etc...

2.5 EXTERNAL, WITH SUPPLIERS

¢ The Change Control process is now underway. Suppliers have been given
planning data from which to assess the impacts of the delays. The Suppliers
Forum has been notified of the solid state of the Replan and committed itself
to facilitating thé changes. However, the indications are that we will come
under pressure'to recompense suppliers. for moncys lost today, never mind
the claw back in eight years time. As predicted last month, this is likely to be
a tough round of negotiations.

2.6 INTERNAL TO ICL PATHWAY

© With the Replan bedding down, and a large numbers of Change Proposals
now approved or at. least-clearly visible, attention has focused on proper
quantification of the full financial impact this year. A series of joint
programme office and. financial reviews has been conducted to match all the
development, build and support plans to departmental forecasts. The impacts
have been extended into the Business Plan where there are knock on
implications on eg. levels of support. required to maintain a more complex
system. The Business Plan had already been-updated in anticipation of these
changes and to reflect the extension of contract term, but it has now been
brought up to date. The impacts on 1997 and the Business Case are both
worse than previously thought.

"© Quarterly targets by Departmental on headcount and sub-contract Project
spend will be set later this week to ensure that spend is held back as long as
possible to reflect the delays in roll out. These will be designed not to
adversely impact on urgent development.or test and integration work, but

may call for more concerted efforts to redeploy people from other areas pro-
tem.

3 CURRENT CRITICAL PROBLEMS

© Noné critical now, a number alluded to above which could become so.
4 ISSUES

e The Replan not been put to bed contractually - possible issues of principle
with DSS yet to deal with.

° Release le, 2 and 3 work beginning to “pile up” as effort is focused on 1b
and 1c. The rapid succession of releases is a risk to both timescales and cost
control: we may have one release too many in the programme between now
and, next April - but it is difficult to see which one could-go.

e Project overspend - far more money is going‘on development and T&I than
was originally envisaged (more than double) - due.to a combination of system
complexity not properly understood at Tender stage, the amount of change
needed to ensure compliance with Requirements, and the increase in start up
duration. As things stand, some of these additional costs will wash though the
Steady State phase of the contract unless steps are taken to prevent them
doing so. .

e Making sure New Business/reengineered POCL products happen.

5 COSTS

e Shown below in very summary form are the cost/(WBS movements relative to
the post-Replan Business Case presented to Fujitsa in February as the. basis
for their funding support. The Business Case varied for Replan delays had
previously balanced back to the original.ISC casé in broad terms by virtue of
the contract extension. In relation to the added ‘programme complexity
identified.since award of contract, the additional costs and capital had
previously been offset by the inclusion of £100m of POCL revenue which
had “firmed up” during Drop Down sufficiéntly for revenue contingencies to
be released.

e Excluded are reductions in 1997 cost of sales/capital due solely to the
timescale shift. The deltas are expressed as project impacts. The 1997 deltas
also.apply to 1997 costs and cash, but against those must.be netted the
beneficial (short’term) impacts of delay.

e The heavy up-front hit means that NPV and IRR are both significantly
damaged.

e On the positive side, the risk register balance has. been reduced by commercial
action and inclusion of costs in the Business Case not previously iiicluded.

¢ The movements in the Business Case are in net terms significant and
damaging. We will have to address them in the coming weeks through a
combination of scrutinising all on-going costs (zero based budgets beyond the
“Build” phase, looking at the complete end to.end supply chain of support
and other costs) and securing POCL/client reengineering and New Business
commitments which leverage the infrastructure.

1 SUMMARY

The major achievement has been to get the on-line CAPS business rules and
interfaces agreed and defined. It has taken over half of the unit’s resources this
month but has demonstrated that a forceful style can be beneficial. A new
SADD was published which incorporates the on-line CAPS business rules
agreed.

2.3 POST DROP DOWN

© Just when we thought the drop down earthquake had finished along comes
an aftershock: we have responded to a CR to drop down the audit
requirements in Schedules AQ3.

2.4 DETAILED PLAN ACTIVITIES

2.4.1 CURRENT ACTIVITIES

2.4.1.1 RELEASE 1
© The Post Office Closures paper achieved sign-off.

¢ All outstanding PINICL’s for Releases 1a and 1b were cleared. There are a
small number outstanding for Releases 1c and 1e.

¢ The Service Agreement for EDS has been written and sent for review to PDA
and to EDS (who are happy with it).

e Agreement on the MIS reports was achieved, just a few minor changes.

2.4.1.2 RELEASE 2

CAPS On-line Interface: This has been the most significant activity of the
month. CR P16a, then b, were dealt with, much of the last two weeks spent
developing CCN117 in response. This is now complete for review by Pathway
and the PDA. It has entailed often muscular discussions with relevant
Authorities and producing changes to:

The Requirements Catalogue
The Solutions Catalogue
CMS, PAS and BES Service Definitions

Fraud liabilities (Schedule B08)
SADD sections 3 and 4

© In addition three revision levels of thé associated CAPS interfaces were
reviewed, partly rewritten and comments returned. The most recent version,
received Wednesday is acceptable and will. form the basis for'Pathway release
2.

¢ Further work is in hand to generate two further, smaller CCNs to cover on-
line enquiries and a common data interface definition for batch and online
operations.

¢ “Card” Definition: This entails overhauling the entire contract for a
definition of Card which in inany places means Payment Card or Temporary
Token when in some places it can.méan.one or the other or both.

e CPs to factor the changes froni CCN117 into Pathway Release 2 in the CAS
and PAS/CMS areas are being raised. The on-line functionality represents the
major part of this.

e The paper on business rules for foreign. encashments, encompassing all the
Byzantine payment rules and proxy relationships has been rewritten and is
with the PDA for comment by 4" April. Simplifications, relatively speaking,
to these rules which would otherwise embarrass BES have been negotiated.

¢ Remote Stock-unit - Initial analysis of CR done. PDA have been advised that
we will report back on 15/4/97.

e Quantum - Two reviéws with POCL have been held. Landis & Gyr (Owners
of Quantum) aré-concerned that the lack ‘of a hardware based security method
(i.e. a retailer smart card) will not be robust enough. Tom Parker has
prepared a proposal to usé a software based method and the counter
peripherals as défined, for.use in discussions with L&G.

e There-are some worrying undercurrents here - POCL will try to make out it is
our problem. L&G havé limited motivation to accommodate Pathway since
they already have another retail outlet via the Paypoint terminal which does
support a retailer card and of course they sell the device.

2.4.1.3 RELEASE 2/3

© Work onthe “Government Direct” initiative has been started in POCL and
will be reviewed here in mid April.

e APPU Hardware: The IPR license trarisfer will be signed by Pathway in a.few
days. This will allow POCL-to release. the-design and build documents-and
the APPU software to us. The decision about how many outlets, and who
Pays is to be resolved by Finance & Commercial.

2.4.1.4 CARS

e The CARs are again right up to date. On 27/3 the customer had 65 overdue.
The notable progress was getting the bulk of the Reférence Data,CARs
completed, albeit with commitments on POCL to keep updating the files.

2.4.1.5 ACCEPTANCE

¢ During the month a full schedule was produced and communicated to the
PDA and the first Acceptance Specifications are on the point of being
published.

e Acéess to thé database-has been established and we:are expecting the up-to-
date test.condition library to come on-stream mid April.

e A new version of the BES Acceptance Specifications was produced by T&I
" following discussions. This covers T&I testable conditions with the original
BES requirements; more work will be done to incorporate other, mostly PAS
requirements which will be tested within. BES.

e PAS/CMS - the PAS and CMS Acceptance Specification was reviewed, and a
new'version produced. Extensive test conditions are in place, which need to
be reviewed in detail

¢ CAPS Interface - the Acceptance Specification for this area is due in April.
The test conditions have largely beén produced by the testing and integration
teams.

2.4.1.6 NEW BUSINESS SUPPORT

e Mails BRD - New version received arid now out for assessment within
Pathway. POCL are-placing less emphasis on the generic.nature of the
service, and more on Mails functionality. Pathway need to determine the
development base from'which our solution will be built.

¢ Distribution BRD - formerly Inventory Management, The draft BRD was
received and turned around. The first real version is now due.

e DNS - Technical options paper received and comments made. This will
resultin a BRD in due-course.

e EFTPOS - Discussions were held with ICL Retail and a joint workshop with
POCL and their consultants, Pathway and ICL Retail will be held on 3" April
to define system and service boundaries. POCL still expect this to be in.

Customer Service Report

1 MONTHLY SUMMARY

1.1 OPERATIONS

1.1.1 INITIAL GO LIVE - 2

© The undoubted highlight of the month was the successful upgrade, over
Easter, of CAPS 1 to CAPS 2 and IGL 0.2.to [GL 0.3. Although there were
a ‘few operational and technical problems in the upgrade it was successfully
signed off by all parties.

© The'servicé continues to run successfully with few technical problems.

© An escalation process between Pathway, [TSA.and PDA has been agreed and
implemented.

1.1.2 MIGRATION

1.1.2.1 RELEASE 1B

@ Release 1B will go live on Monday 28th,April. Martin Riddell will publish
the transition plan on Thursday 10 April for review with POCL.

© Operational readiness reviews (ORRs) have been scheduled from Monday 7
April to look at ICL CFM’s capability and readiness to provide and manage
the Horizon Systems Help-desk and Systems Management Centre.

© Further reviews will be held the following week covering Systems Operate
and Pathway’s 3rd and 4th line support capability.

© A major problem with software distribution and Riposte has been solved
leaving.no apparent outstanding operational or support-issues.

1.1.2.2 RELEASE 1c

© Our main.focus of attention is the migration methodology of moving from
Release 1B to 1C.

© To carry out the Release 1A to 1C migration (10 IGL Post Offices) and the
Release 1B-to 1C migration (190 OBCS only Post Offices) over the:same
weekend is unacceptably high risk and so these activities will be split
between two weekends around 30 June.

© Qur ability to distribute software to the Release 1€ environment using
Tivoli is currently being tested and a decision on the technique is expected
to be made by Friday 11" April.

11.1.3 sYsTEMS MANAGEMENT

e Systems.Management in terms of counter software distribution is making
good progress

© Progress.oi software distribution to central NT configurations is'less
advanced although in theory there should be few differences.

© We are concentrating on the process and procedures for administering and
managing.software distribution.

1.1.4 SYSTEMS OPERATION

e@ ICL CFM continue to provide reasonable service in operating the IGL
system and played their part in upgrading to Release 1A, however, I am
concerned at the number of simple ‘operator errors’ which occur.

e They have now produced their first operations manual which is a good start
but still. needs a lot more work to make it Pathway specific.

© Our contract and charging arrangements with ICL CFM have been’placed
under closer scrutiny since.it appears there may be an element of double
counting.

@ The issue of home working to provide support from Northern Ireland is
still not finally resolved but we are now more optimistic that the security
problems are not as serious as were originally voiced by the PDA. A formal
response to John Dicks’ letter is expected next month. ,

1.2 POCL SERVICES

© The POCL Card Distribution Contract will be signed off next month.

© John Dicks, Martyn Bennett and I are now agreed that there is no viable
alternative to the use of PUNs at this time. [ will continue to monitor the
effectiveness of the process and report on any improvement opportunities
as operational experience improves.

1.3 BA SERVICES

© 1557 cards have been issued to 31 March.

© Process modelling for the production of Temporary Tokens has moved
forward during this month, with Oracle undertaking the design following
detailed discussion of requirement.

1.4.2 ACCEPTANCE

© All supplier responses to the aéceptance packs were received by mid March
and reviewed by the appropriate Service Manager which led to some re-
work.

© Denise lvermee collated the combined Supplier and Customer Service
fesporises on acceptance criteria and. conducted a review rehearsal on.25"
March which enabled her'to piblish-the first version of the Acceptance
Specification to the PDA for review.

1.5 MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SERVICES

1.5.1 SERVICE LEVEL MANAGEMENT

Customer Service Report Date: 14/04/97

© As aresult of CAPS failing to take into account double bank holiday
payments for Easter Monday, customers were unable to make double
encashments on the previous Monday - 24/03. CAPS forwarded an extra
file to us during the afternoon of 24", and we were able to get the data
down to the post-office counter. Everything worked smoothly and there
were no reconciliation problems. :

11.5.4 RECONCILIATION - RELEASE 1

© Oracle have'supplied the reports specified and they have been released into
T&l. Richard Brunskill has'identified the tests required.

e@ The PDA appear to be content with the format of the reports which are
now baselined and can.therefore only be modified under change-control.

© There is'n6 formal réconciliation’requirement for OBGS in Release 1B
although Richard will provide:the reports necessary for. charging.

© Stalemate exists between Pathway and the-PDA over the reconciliation
requirements for-APS. We continue to-maintain that we are.adhering to the
reqhirement to provide information electronically. Their insistence that a
liard copy reconciliation / file summary is produced for files delivered to
HAPS should. be subject to a formal Change Request. I am addressing this
through John Dicks’ team.

1.5.5 PERFORMANCE BENCHMARKS

e Jan Ambrose continues to make good progress in establishing the
performance benchmark process. She has reviewed the:-amended OBCS
encashment transaction and receipt times with POCL’s ‘Efficiency and
Process Support’ team and provided them.with revised BES transaction
times, developed using Release 1C PRD Version 0.7.

© It has been agreed with the PDA that-transaction times for single.and two-
key transaction types should be measured using'the keyboard rather than
the touch-screen, which is significantly slower. Transactions requiring three
or more key depressions will be accessed using the touch-screen only. This
presents a significant advantage to Pathway in achieving conformance to
transaction performance requirements.

e It has been agreed with the PDA that the printing of the second APS receipt
shall take place outside of the timed transaction and will not therefore
impact overall transaction times.

1.5.6 CUSTOMER SATISFACTION

e An Implementation and Service Review has been established which will
permit regular monitoring of Post Office outlets as they move from the
implementation phase to operational.-service.

© A joint PDA/Pathway Evaluation and Satisfaction Forum has been
established to monitor the various activities-being undertaken:to evaluate
satisfaction levels during implementation and in steady state.

© A draft of the Service Visit Reply Card has been provided tothe PDA for
comment.

4.1 SYSTEMS MANAGEMENT

© The hardware configuration for the model office at Release 1B is
insufficient for operational use in terms of resilience and its isolation from
test configurations. Martin Riddell is addressing this urgently.

e Although technically there should be no problems with Tivoli Systems
Management’s ability to distribute software, the Release management

process has still to be finalised.

Quality & Risk Report. Date: 14/04/97

1.2 RISK MANAGEMENT

¢ Arisk review has been conducted during March, which identified the
following:

Migration of Manual Post Offices is no longer a risk as the
approach proposed by Pathway has had broad agreement.

Technical support of the system is-a new risk. This relates to
homeworking from CFM Belfast. PDA have indicated that thé
Red Pike encryption algorithm may be inadequate. This is being
‘followed up with CESG.

Fraud investigation costs. Following some comments from BA
fraud investigators, regarding the obligation for DSS.to investigate
all suspect frauds, Schedule B08 is being reviewed to ascertain
Pathway’s potential exposure.

1.3 SYSTEM SECURITY

¢ Access Control Policy. A formal response to Version 0.6 has been received
from the PDA and a review was held on 25" March. We (Pathway) are
treating the ACP 0.6 as if it has already been baselined. The PDA have been
reviewing Section 8 of the ACP (OPS.Domain) in isolation, and a
demonstration of the Riposte ‘in-office-access’ capabilities took place on 12"
March. This served to highlight the deficiencies in the product. As a result,
nineteen issues were: raised predominantly relating to access control in thé
OPS domain and particularly where the access controls do not reflect
BS7799. A formal session was held with the PDA in Borough High Stréet on
26" March where the issues and their status were progressed. Development
actions are underway to assess the extent of the changes required. A full
development impact analysis of the ACP is also underway. The objective is to
subrnit a Pathway impacted and baselined to the PDA for review and sign-off
during the week beginning April 14".

© Mapping of Access requirements to Roles / Profiles (a very large task) is being
undertaken for each component by the relevant supplier.

¢ The Security Functional Specification has been updated to take into account
of:

Energis inter-campus link.
Data Warehouse solution.
Virus protection requirements.
Cryptography changes.

Improved alignment with the Access Control Policy and the
Technical Environment Définition (TED).

It is being reviewed internally before submission to PDA for sign off.

e Change proposals for 3 major components-of-the security solution have been
submitted and deferred; Token Authentication (SecureID), Access
Management (COSManager) and Link Encryption (Zergo). Modifications-to
the CP’s are being made for resubmission.

© Release strategy. Security release contents for Rib have been agreed with
Jeremy Folkes (PDA). The Release 1c conténts definition agreement is subject

¢ Implementation of the required UNIX / Oracle environmenc(s) in the Data
Centres; Fundamental to the-security and audit that we €nvisage for the:
Sequent / Oracle environment is the COSManager product, Sequent’s’
proposal for the product has been. rejected and BAP is tasked with a)
reviewing Sequent’s pricing and b).identifying alternative products.

e Further discussions have taken. place to address IT:Security Breaches, their-
management and escalation. PDA is to provide a ‘template’ of the record
definition currently used to escalate [T~ security events to UNIRAS:
Considerable effort is:required to analyse and define Pathway event
management,

¢ Key Management System development, including standards, processes-and
procedures is being undertaken as a matter of priority by TSC. It is intended
that we meet with CESG during April to discuss technical and commercial
aspects of supply key generation material.

© A Telephone Caller Identification process for Help Desks and all callers
(POCL dnd BA) has been agreed with PDA.

© System Firewalls. Sun Firewall 1 software is.being proposed for file transfer
links eg De La Rue. For faster, links eg CFM, Sorbus, Feltham dedicated
hardware.is required. The threat and proposed solutions are to be reviewed.

¢ Security Card Production. These identity cards are required for all Pathway /
represéntative staff who have access behind the Post Office counter eg for
surveys, installation, maintenance. These are being produced under the
control of Pathway security, and logged ona database. A process for the
production, logging and management of the cards is being developed.

e Site security Audits.

Girobank. CFM have been tasked with producing a process for
power down, maintaining security and ensuring continuity in the
event of an alarm. Girobank have committed to provide dedicated
‘fire-fighters’; an.alert process needs to be developed and SLA’s

hardware which cannot be supported by the Pathway solution. Alternative
(software) approaches have been considered and a paper’sent to L&¢G for
consideration. A meeting is planned week beginning 7 April to discuss.

© Delivery of Post Master memory cards. Procedures are being developed with
Implementation.

1.4 INTERNAL SECURITY

© Intetnal virus contro] procedures are being déveloped; they are dependent on

Management of Change to develop an approach to measurement and
evaluation of customer satisfaction.

« Self Assessment (Strategic Business Model). A Self Assessment exercise has
been conducted with the Senior Management Team. The overall Score was
542 compared with 11/95 score of 372. This reflected improvement in all
areas, except Leadership, especially Processes and Business Results. Detailed
comments from attendees Workbooks extracted, reviewed, and summary of
key points circulated. An Action Plan has been developed with each of the
management team taking responsibility for an improvement area. I suggested
to the SMT that Self Assessment could be used at a Departmental level as a
basis for identifying areas for improvement, leading on to action plans and
Departmental / Personal Objective setting. The suggestion was taken up by
Customer Services and a Self Assessment carried out with the CS management
team. Results have been summarised and circulated.

1.6 PROCESS MANAGEMENT

e Process Audits. The Development Process Audit has been completed. A report
has been drafted and circulated for comment prior to issue. A number of
strengths were observed including the formal Incident Management System
(PINICL); control of information into Configuration Management and Joint
Working with customer representatives to evaluate counter solutions. The
major aspect needing attention is the documentation required under two
broad categories; Design Specifications and Test Documentation. A full
report will be issued early in April, and a corrective plan agreed.

© New Product / Service Introduction. A meeting with John Meagher has
resulted in some apparent easing of the PDA logjam.

e Reference Data Management process development. An acceptable Pathway
process has been developed, which is currently being technically validated,
before being despatched to PDA and Customer Services for review.

¢ Customer Requirements processes / CAR’s. A draft process has been
despatched to PDA for review.

e Upgrade Online Standards. Release 5 completed.

* Roll Out/ Implementation. Assistance and documentation is being provided
to the Implementation team as required.

© Configuration Management. Work on developing these processes has begun.

* Development Method. This has been significantly updated and a draft
reissued for comment. It will form the basis of Release 6 of the On Line Help
Standards.

Business Development Report

1 SUMMARY

1.1 GENERAL:

_Major progress achieved on Migration. The contractual obligation was ICL

Pathway’s but this had not been budgeted. However we had budgeted for
post installation training visits. We have now managed to combine the two
and sub-contract the-migration activity back to POCL. Their costs, for this
activity will bé £2.1million while our budgeted training visits were
£5.Omillion thus representing a significant and welcome saving to ICL
Pathway.

Training programmé is now getting locked down. We have endeavoured to
identify up to £2.0million saving off the £8.Omillion extra training cost built
into the re-plan budget. However this has proved impossible and while
efforts continue, the saving to be gained from use of POCL premises and
such like is highly unlikely to hit £1.0million.

Efforts continue to alleviate the ‘fitting kit on the counter problem’. The
team will visit An Post next week to discuss practicalities with them as they
hit similar problems. We will use the 190 Live Trial sites to better identify
the real scope of the problem. However, I am having our team get the ‘mind-
set’ right, i.e. let’s find ways of fitting the.kit on the counter rather than
accepting that it won’t! The principal hit on any related costs may be [CL
Pathways so it is imperative that we find efféctive solutions to this issue.

Communications continues to be‘a tough one. As we get into a finer level of
detail, it is becoming apparent that the sponsors have. not been updated on
the finer details of our solution. This has caused a major discussion with the
PDA which has identified the size of the problem. As a result, a-meeting was
arranged for Friday last, 4"" April with representatives from BA to present the
ICL Pathway solution. This meeting has served to better identify: the gaps:in
expectation and the various sponsor organisations have retreated to consider
the perceived gaps. They will feedback by Friday 11".

An ICL Retail briefing for POCL was postponed by POCL at the last minute
due to the unavailability of some key people. This will be re-arranged for
later in April or early May.

Department of National Savings (DNS) have issued an RFI OJEC notice for
a significant part of their business operations. ] have been working with
several parts of [CL, principally CFM (Neal Bagshaw) to see how best ICL
can respond to this OJEC. It has now been agreed that CFM will front the
response and we will continue discussions as to how to best-utilise the ICL
Pathway infrastructure.and POCL in the detailed response later.

Post Office have also issued a tender for a telephony based. help desk system.
CFM have also picked this up with help from ICL Ireland who have-won a
similar contract recently with Telecom Eireann. Both of these latter two
demonstrate what is achievable if different parts of the one ICL talk:to each
other and better understand the potential added value of the [CL Pathway
position and our relationships.

Business Development activities continue but not to the level of final
commitment that I would like. This is mainly due to the-length of the various
processes within POCL and their clients. We continue to look for ways of
slimming down these processes.

I have been involved with briefing sessions with Dave Miller and Wendy
Goldstraw, Regional General Managers for South West and Scotland
respectively: This‘was a’ PDA sponsored activity ‘through Bruce McNiven.
The main issues that arose from these were the pressure on the regions that
the automation programme is bringing and the lack of a co-ordinated
approach from POCL Strategic Head Office (SHO) regarding other areas
related to the programme, e.g. Comms., Retail Development.

Contact has been made with Andrew Neill of ICL Financial Services who has
recently joined ICL from Unisys. His experience in Payment systems and
Electronic.Commerce could be very useful to-us.as we head down the smart
card route. A meeting has been set up to appraise him of the {CL Pathway
service. :

The consultancy contract-with Robert Atkins has been terminated as of 31"
March.

1.2 MARKETING COMMUNICATIONS

1.2.1 CUSTOMER EDUCATION

e The.most significant event-this month has been the negotiation
surrounding customer education and our basic approach. These
negotiations arc happening later than is desirable, but the fact chat:they are
happening is progress. The difficulties being experiericed are a symptom of
the way the requirements were constructed with us (ICL.Pathway) having
joint management responsibility and ownership of the budget (via the-
scorecard). The PDA have consistently refused to accept joint management
and hence the current impasse: they would rather issue edicts than jointly
plan and implement.

© To recap, the PDA want a benefit by benefit approach: they refuse to
accept that communication should surround the change of instrument. of
payment. The approach they require can not: be implemented as the
audietice can not be discretely segmented. The.PDA argue that we have
already agreed to this - there is good evidence to-show we have not. They
might be beginning to realise the absurdity of their request and we must
now guard against them causing us to extend the duration of the
advertising.

1.2.2 SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS

e Plan completed covering all key deliverables:and production schedules .
Chrissie is making.good but slow progress with the Preston. part of the
PDA to gain agreement.

1.2.3 PRESS PLANNING
e Most key deliverables have beén drafted: no.PDA agreement as yet.

e No furthér progress on their acceptance of our crisis communication plan
and how they relate to our processes.

“11.2.4 INTERNAL COMMUNICATIONS

e Another good month especially on the POCL/NFSP side - ‘work done on
information flows to the regions as well as the start of work on the
communication of changed processes.

© Corporate Presentation on ‘This is ICL Pathway’ still scheduled for late
April.

e We are working on a Series of activities to formally demonstrate the
equipment to all staff (not IGL or gamma) in May.

© Dress down day raised £200 for red nose day:

© A quiz night is to be arranged.

1.2.5 MISCELLANEOUS

e Helpdesks/Helplines - a real.issue in terms of their co-ordination and
specifically with reference to their use for customer education. Anna has
now input to their briefing questions and circulated these to Girobank.

e Anna will shortly be seeing other key suppliers'with. Martyn Bennett-to
play into their current plans for crisis: management & to ensure they fit
with our crisis approach. Anna will also explain our approach to group.
And additional focus will bé given to promotion of our media profile.

e French Thornton’s findings have identified ‘major barriers:to the overall
change that the regions are attempting and it seems likely that soine
programmes (not Horizon which remains the number 1 priority) will be
dropped.

e A lot of work has been done on the User Awareness événts.which have
gone very well. Attendance has been excéptionally high (95% +),
awareness at the beginning of the event has also been very high (all credit

* to the internal awareness programme) and comments have been very
encouraging ¢:g:

“TI feel much happier driving home than I did driving down here”

e The initial lead on Help Desk rationalisation has become a firm
opportunity. Post Office Group have placed a European. Journal entry for
the hardware and software to equip two 300 seat helpdesks. Discussions
with, Post Office Group. reveal that it is for SSL who are building their
capability top bid-for internal and external business. ICL Ireland are keen
to be involved in a bid and the details have been passed to Sorbus and
CFM.

e The Regional User Satisfaction Managers.are doing valuable work. The
Red Amber Green initiative which identifies potentially problematic: Post
Offices is particularly successful, having been adopted by both North East
and South West. In total 2:5 offices have been identified with various
problemis eg space, resignation-and bad attitude. Further work will reveal
what can be doné within existing budgets and what may need to be
discussed further with the PDA. The Information Flow project identifies
what can be done'to ensure all parties-receive the information they require
as effectively as possible. Both of these projects are highly valued by the
RLMs.

© Two meetings of The Evaluation and Satisfaction Forum have taken place
attended primarily by Bruce McNiven and Dave McLaughlin from the
PDA and Peter Burden, Dave Fletcher and Steve Cowburn from ICL
Pathway. It has been agreed that the Foram will take a-broad view of all
satisfaction and evaluation issues whilst not. replicating work done on SLAs
or on contractual matters. The Forum is attempting to identify all
measurement and evaluation, streams that the various parties are planning
with a view to reduce duplication and therefore costs for’all those
involved. This will also ensure that users will not repeatedly be asked to
provide similar information. Key Indicators of Satisfaction will be adopted
and a balanced scorecard approach has been proposed.

e After successfully managing the Management Awareness programme Mike
Neal.has returned to ICL Consultancy. He has been a valuable member of
the team.

1.3 BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT

e Client Launch Day programme for key clients is progressing well with buy-
in being received from all clients. Seniority of audience. from Royal Mail
particularly pleasing.

e Based on the lengthening Partnership Projects list, POCL has appointed a
Business Development Manager to work on new business opportunities.
Our aim is that this individual -will work closely with [CL Pathway to
identify, scope, and progress all the new business opportunities that
automation-enables. The key difference‘is that previously all new business
opportunities were progressed by the account teams'who already had full
time jobs’ managing the existing clients.

© Approach to Day 1 scorecard initial set-up and subsequent management
has been agreed at a working level with POCL. Once the. results of the
detailed work in this area (Mark Wilcox) have been agreed, it will be
progressed as a change proposal via the joint Commercial & Finance
forum. .

e The processés which. POCL have in place to:
- Identify and document client requirements,
- Obtain buy-in from the account team and client,
- Identify and agree benefits to both.POCL and client,

aré not performing well. Accordingly, we have begun discussions with
POGL which we (ICL-Pathway) hope will put in place more.robust
processes with increased support-and contro] from the senior management
within POCL.

e The:resources which POCL have in place to map and re-engineer the
existing processes with their clients are stretched, and the work is typically
being undertaken by the account teams without the full time support of
professional process engineers. Accordingly the requirements which we
are receiving are of very varied quality, and require much “to and fro-ing”
between ourselves, POCL, and the client. On that basis, there may be a
need to get our analysts and process experts involved up-front to ensure
that well specified requirements are received, and that time and resource is
not wasted in the development périod.

1.4 MANAGEMENT OF CHANGE

¢ The Management Awareness programme is nearly complete . By the end of
March, 18 events have been completed. The events have been very well
received and have succeeded in their objective of “passing responsibility.
for the change” to the regions. This‘can Clearly be seen by the activities of

the.RLMs and the concerns being voiced over RNM workload.

1.5 CLIENT MANAGEMENT

¢ The ICL Showcase at the Raddison Hotel at Heathrow occurred from 10" -
12™ March and the ICL Pathway stand was visited by the majority of the
attendees despite its slightly out of the way location and received very
favorable reaction.

¢ The ICL Retail briefing event for Paul Rich set for 25'" March was postponed
the day before by Paul Rich. A new date later in April is being sort.

© The meeting with Pat Kelsey and Robin O’Connor at Bird & Bird took place
on 5/3/97 with Tony Oppenheim. The PDA agreed to contribute £7.2K to
the costs incurred over the BA flying logos issue of last August.

e Further contact continues with Microsoft including on the support services.
Briefings from Alan Ward and Dick Long will be conveyed.

« Discussions with Sequent concerning our joining their stand for the PittCom
event on Wednesday 21" May will be held very shortly and the resultant
activity schedule produced. This is an opportunity to show new MP’s our
system at little cost and risk.

« The War Pensions designs were finally delivered to De La Rue Card
Technology on 26" March some 12 days later than the 14" promised at Bird
& Bird on 5".

e The Post Masters’ Memory Card (PMMC) needs to have its design created
and approved by the end of April in order to achieve delivery to Pathway
(D2D?) by the end of June. The PDA have already agreed that their say in
this is more limited so it may not be as daunting as previous experience might
have lead us believe.

«© Temporary Tokens is in area that needs coordination and Robin O’Connor
has asked Martin J. to remain involved.

3 CURRENT CRITICAL PROBLEMS

None

4 ISSUES

¢ The current situation on the Communications programme is the biggest issue.
This is going to be a tough one to crack but I am confident of maintaining the

ICL Pathway baseline.

The fitting the kit on the counter is still a concern. I do not really see this
getting sorted until after the 190 live trial sites have been surveyed. We will

then have a much better view of the scope of the problem.

The acceptance of the baseline dates for new releases is still causing concern. I
am raising this with Paul Rich so that he can top down let his team know of

the criticality of these dates.

1 SUMMARY

e Escher have had a team in Australia Post for 2 weeks in March to begin I
detailed work on their implementation. Some holes are already beginning to
emerge in areas that are not within Escher’s domain of expertise and itis
likely that they will soon request assistance from us.

© Our proposal for a design study at Deutsche Post (led by Fujitsu [CL
Germany) has been accepted in principle and details are now under
negotiation. As part of the-study a senior delegation will visit-us on 22-23
April.

e We continue to develop interest.from the Japanese Ministry of Post and
Télecommunications (MPT) along with the:Fujitsu account team. MPT have
appointed the Namira Research Institute as consultants. NRI visited-us.on
21" March, were impressed with what they saw’ and wish to return in the
summer.

¢ We are still awaiting a decision in Bulgafia on our joint. bid with British
Postal Consultancy Services, An Post and ICL Bulgaria, following a change in
Government.

e Singapore Post have givén acceptance. for their’pilot system and'we
commenced roll-out.o 27" March. The ICL Singapore project team have
praised the support given by Dick Long and his team without which they
would not have been able to achieve this milestone.

¢ Negotiations for a joint agreement on international sales with An Post and
Escher are marking time.

-2 PROGRESS

There are no handshake milestones affected by international sales.

3 CURRENT CRITICAL PROBLEMS

None.

4 ISSUE

e The Australia Post demands on Escher are already coming into.conttict with
ICL Pathway’s demands. We must be extra vigilant to ensure that our needs
are clearly understood and our milestones. are achieved.

1 MONTHLY SUMMARY

© The proposal for a Freelancer Management initiative was accepted by
Programmes and worked up into a set of deliverables and milestone plan.
Roll out has begun with.communication to managers and team.leaders of
freelance staff, resulting in unanimous support. Individual discussions with
freelancers, during early April, will enable total roll out of this major piece of
work by the middle of that. month. =~

© An Organisation management Review of Programmes has resulted in a plan
to reorganise top level management in Development and T&1. Changes will
be implemented on a transitional basis over the next two to three months

e The joint PDA/Pathway management away day was run during early March.
Focusing on the enhancement of relationship between the two management
teams, the day was reasonably successful with actions and an implementation
timetable being agreed

¢ A significant feature during the month was'the impact of the ICL
Management Executive’s Group-wide focus on headcount control, requiring
the submission of detailed manpower projections. Management of headcount
and pay costs. is crucial to the Pathway business case and, as in other [CL
businesses, will come under. strong scrutiny from the Group centre
throughout 1997 and’ beyond

e Melanie Lyng has made a strong start as Personnel Operations Manager
