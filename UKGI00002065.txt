Thanks Tim, that's very good to hear. We intervened with Jon M last night and he said he would pick this up with the
team.

Enjoy the rest of your weekend.

Will, Martin,

See below an extract from an email just received from Freshfields related to the Horizon disclosure.

Martin, I want to wait for the fat lady to sing, but it looks like you managed to make more progress (or rather progress)
that we could at this end. Many thanks for taking the baton.

Extract From Email:

"The Horizon language is still in the draft, but I spoke to Alex Dunn just now and he says that all of the Horizon disclosure
will be taken out today - which is good news."

Have a good rest of the weekend.
Tim
