The plan is to do a medium volume rollout on 15" March, April. The action was captured at the
followed by a high volume rollout on 22"! March, and then programme board and is CLOSED
followed by a series of high volume rollouts. on this action log.

ET were concerned that there must be a success criteria in

volume roll-out unless we are sure that the system will be
operational and stable in the network).
