a) Allowing the technical teams the right amount of time to diagnose and impact an incident
b) Avoiding unnecessary alerting of the customer

c) Assessing which incidents are major

2.2. Interfacing to Post Office

« During the MAC Core Hours (Monday — Friday 08:00 — 20:00, Saturday 08:00 — 17:00) and Bank
Holidays 0800 — 1400 excluding Christmas Day. The MAC should be the first point of operational
contact between Fujitsu and the Post Office Service Desk. The SMC are responsible for
escalation of incidents to the POA OOH Duty Manager. The POA OOH Duty Manager may
initiate communications with the Post Office OOH Duty Manger. The SMC operate on a 24 x 7x
365 basis.

e Any activity detailed in this document which is assigned to the MAC team is handed over to the
SMC outside the MAC Core Hours, with the exception of the above.

e The relevant technical teams who are aware of and monitoring a potential major incident must
call the appropriate Major Incident Manager (Duty Manager out of hours) as soon as possible.
This is not limited to major incidents alone, but applies wherever a state other than Business as
Usual has been detected. The Major Incident Manager must in turn communicate the potential
incident, to the POL IT Service Desk for awareness and monitoring—This is usually done via the
MAC team in core hours.

e The Major Incident Manager (or Duty Manager out of hours) is responsible for communicating
both up the Fujitsu organisation and across (see appendix 9.3) to their counterpart in Post Office.
Where this is impractical (e.g. leave, out of hours, unavailable), the initiative should be taken to
jump up the organisation. Of prime importance is that the customer is informed in a timely
manner and at the correct touch point. This communication should be by voice or direct SMS.
The communication should include the date, time, name, nature of the incident, priority, if service
affecting, likely impact, and the Fujitsu owner to contact.

POA Operations Major Incident Procedure

FUJITSU FUJITSU RESTRICTED (COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE)

e The Major Incident Manager (Duty Manager OOH, who covers Monday to Friday 17:30 to 09:00
and from 17:00 Friday though to 09:00 Monday) should also initiate communication using SMS
via the MAC team (see operational hours above.). Outside of these hours the SMS should be via
the SMC. The SMS distribution list used is titled ‘POASeniors' in hours by the MAC team and
“SMS Internal’ out of hours by the SMC and amongst others includes the appropriate members of
the POA Operations Management Team.

3 Post Office Account defining a Major Incident

3.1. Incident Classification

As a general rule a Major Incident will be an incident rated as a Business Critical Incident as shown in the
following

- The ‘CONTRACT’
- Sections 3.2 and 3.3 below.
- POA Operations Incident Management Procedure document (SVM/SDM/PRO/0018).

- A series of connected lower priority incidents which combine to have a significant business
impact.

However not all incidents rated as priority 1 qualify as a Major Incident as the priority levels do not always
reflect the overall business impact to POL. For example a single counter post office which is unable to
trade, regardless of its business volumes, is rated as a priority 1 incident.

For incident classification on Post Office Account refer to the POA Incident Enquiry Matrix
SVM/SDM/SD/0023.

3.2. Influencing Factors in calling a Major Incident

It is important that a Major Incident is defined in accordance with section 3.3 Major Incident Triggers, as
such, because of its business impact on the day when it occurs, rather than simply being defined as a
Major Incident because it appears on a list. However the following parameters will also feed into the
consideration of whether a major incident should be called:

e Duration, i.e. how long has the vulnerability to service already existed?

e Impact across the estate, including consideration of whether a service is merely degraded or
actually stopped

e Time at which the event occurs in relation to the 24 hour business day

e Time of year — e.g. Peak Trading Period, Christmas / Easter / End of month / quarter
« Anticipated time before service can be resumed

e Impact to POL branches, customers, clients or brand image

e Business initiatives e.g. product launches

3.3 Major Incident Triggers

The following criteria could trigger a major incident, however as detailed in 3.2, the influencing factors
must also be considered. As such the list below is not exhaustive, whilst if an incident occurs which is
not detailed below, e.g., legislative, it should not necessarily be precluded from being declared a major
incident.

In the event of a Security Incident, minor or major (which also include GDPR and PCI Incidents), the POA
Operational Security Manager MUST be informed.

The POA Incident Management procedure SVM/SDM/PRO/0018 Appendix A provides further guidance
on security incidents and the contact details for the POA Operational Security Manager is contained in
Appendix B.

From a corporate perspective the Fujitsu EMEIA SECURITY INCIDENT REPORTING PROCEDURE is
to be followed.

If the Security Incident has been confirmed to be a GDPR Incident, minor or major please follow the
GDPR process. Also, please add the appropriate configuration item to the incident i.e. GDPR, PCI or
PCI and GDPR. This will allow us to report against any incident where GDPR and/or PCI breaches have
been identified.

In the event of a Security Incident, minor or major (which also include GDPR and PCI Incidents), the POA
Operational Security Manager MUST be informed. It is good practice for any attachments that are being
shared internally via email or sent onto the Post Office following investigation, are password protected, in
order to reduce the risk of a security incident including breaching GDPR or PCI legislation. This is
included in the POA Security Operations Guidance Page

3.3.6 GDPR Triggers

If anybody on the Post Office Account or sub-contractors suspect that a GDPR incident has occurred,
then the Fujitsu Security Operations (CSPOA) team need to be engaged immediately, even out of hours.

When the Fujitsu Security Operations (CSPOA) team have determined or suspect that a GDPR issue has
occurred and that the Major Incident Process needs to be followed:

GDPR major incident triggers\considerations are as follows:
e Is this personal data
e What type of personal data
» Normal data
> Sensitive data
e What is the data shared on, processed on or transmitted through

« Has the data come from a 3 Party or the Customer. For example (AMEX) American Express.
sending EPA files such as the SSK file that does not conform to the AIS (Application Interface
Specification)

e Has data been lost in the Fujitsu domain that can't be explained

e Fujitsu are accountable for ensuring that sub-processors comply with GDPR/PCI legislation and
standards.

If the answer to the above questions has confirmed that there has been a GDPR incident, then the
process that should be adhered to is as follows:

e POA Duty Manager has identified a GDPR incident (suspected GDPR breach), during the
management of an incident.

e In Hours there is a requirement to inform the Fujitsu Security Operations (CSPOA) team, and the

Particularly where root cause analysis of a suspected breach is being undertaken, the email address
an be used as a point of escalation as this mailbox is continually

“monitored:

Data processors (POA and POA sub-processors) must understand what personal data is contained
within any data that has been lost, stolen, altered without permission, been subject to unauthorised
access or is unavailable to the data subject that requires access to it etc.

POL have confirmed that the current Horizon Incident Management Process is to be used in the case of a
suspected GDPR data breach and POL will determine if the incident is a GDPR breach.

In the event of a breach POA are to:
1. Follow the Major Incident Management process as below

2. Make sure if it is deemed a GDPR incident that the Fujitsu EMEIA Security Process is invoked via
this link: EMEIA Breach Notification Policy Link_and ensure that the EMEIA DPO has authorised
a decision to notify POL of a breach before notify POL

3. If instruction to not notify POL by the EMEIA DPO, then do not proceed with notifying POL and
leave as an internal incident.

4. If EMEIA DPO does not provide feedback within the 24 hour window, then proceed with notifying
POL.

5. Immediately (within than 24 hours from discovery) inform POL in order that they can determine if
it is a GDPR breach. POL will notify the ICO and, if appropriate, the impacted data subjects
(under article 33 of GDPR legislation POL have 72 hours from becoming aware of the breach to
notify the ICO of the nature of the breach and the containment plan).

SVM/SDM/PRO/0018 Appendix A provides further guidance on security incidents and the contact details
for the POA Operational Security Manager are contained in Appendix B.

The POA Security Management team will follow:

incident falling within one or more of the following categories should be considered a personal
data breach:

1. unauthorised or accidental disclosure of, or access to, personal data (a “Confidentiality
Breach”)

2. unauthorised or accidental alteration of personal data (an “Integrity Breach”);

3. accidental or unauthorised loss of access to, or destruction of, personal data (an “Availability

eSee Section 5 of SVM/SEC/MAN/3807 ‘Personal Data Summary’.

Post Office are likely to ask POA for technical support in their report of the suspected breach to the ICO
in at least the following areas:

The nature of the suspected breach — what personal data has been impacted and how
oWho accessed what data (content and artefact e.g. log, data file, device etc.) and when
oWhat category is the suspected data breached

oHow many data subjects are suspected to be impacted and what category are these data
subjects (since Horizon is transaction based it may be difficult to supply the number and

Business Continuity needs to be invoked.

4 Calling the Major Incident

During business hours the Major Incident Manager declares and manages the Major Incident (with
handovers to the POA OOH Duty Manager where applicable.)

Where the impact of the incident is not immediately obvious, and it is not clear if a Major Incident should
be called, escalation and discussion with the POA Operations Management Team should occur, and a
collective decision made. If a Major Incident is not called, the incident should be monitored until closure,
to ensure that the impact does not increase to that of a Major Incident.

In the event that multiple services are impacted, multiple Major Incident Managers may be appointed by
any Service Lead or Senior SDM and will remain in their roles until incident closure.

Out of hours the POA OOH Duty Manager is responsible for declaring a Major Incident.

Section 8 of this document specifies the roles and responsibilities during a major incident. The Major
Incident Manager, see section 8.2, is referred to the Manage Major Incident Procedure and must
endeavour throughout the life of a major incident to adhere to the principles of that procedure.

Systems Major Incident Procedure so please refer to the EMEIA procedure and utilise the templates
provided within that procedure. These include the Major Incident Report and e-mail templates.

Section 6.3 of this Post Office Account process details the normal Major Incident Communication Flow
agreed with Post Office

When initiating the Major Incident Report, as required by the Fujitsu EMEIA Business Management
Systems Major Incident Procedure, take into consideration the Post Office specific reporting requirements
detailed in the Post Office Major Incident Report Requirements contained in section 6.4 below.

6 Communications

6.1 Technical Bridge

This is a Fujitsu technical conference for Technical experts and SDU's to discuss and analyse the
incident and to formulate an action plan to restore the service to POL without delay. It should enable the
Technical Recovery Manager to baseline the anticipated response, covering resolution, time and
resources required. This will also include the appropriate owning SDU of the service affected by the
Major Incident.

The Technical Bridge will be set up as required by the Major Incident Manager.

Invitations to the Technical Bridge will be via SMS, email or voice. The SMS will be sent to the distribution
list titled “SMS Technical Bridge’. The SMS text will be sent to technical experts on the POA and will
include outline details of the Major Incident. Also dial in details and the start time will be provided as part
of the meeting invitation.

The Technical Bridge will be started at T + 15 from the trigger, and reconvened at regular intervals during
the Major Incident; the exact scheduling will be discussed and agreed at each preceding Major Incident
Call. The timing of “T+15” for calling a Tech Bridge is for IN Hours only. For OOH the Duty Manager will
be contacted (1 hour reasonable endeavours for response).

The Technical Bridge is chaired by the Major Incident Manager with the recovery managed by the
Technical Recovery Manager.

The Major Incident Communications Manager (MICM) is responsible for ensuring that updates, e.g.,
internal POA or SMS messages to a wider audience are provided at regular intervals, ideally every 30
minutes or longer if an appropriate ETA for the next update relevant to the recovery actions is given.

The MICN is also responsible for ensuring that the Major Incident within TTSNOW is updated at regular
intervals throughout the major incident, including relevant Technical Bridge updates, for audit trail and
report writing purposes.

A request for a Technical Recovery Manager (TRM) will be made to the appropriate Service Delivery Unit
or Development Leads, who will appoint the appropriate resource to be the TRM. Ideally this nomination
is made at the start of the Technical Bridge and will be a SME and a person who is expected to drive to
the resolution. Throughout the Technical Bridge and resolution of the incident, the individual may change
during the bridge and evolvement. Also, there is a possibility that the role could be reassigned to different
individuals.

Following each Technical Bridge, it is the responsibility of the TRM to agree any actions as follows

-Recovery / restoration actions (which should normally include the TfSNow Change numbers),

POA Operations Major Incident Procedure

FUJITSU FUJITSU RESTRICTED (COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE)

6.5 Escalation Communication Protocol

The primary principle:

“Up and Across”

Example:

The Major Incident Manager would escalate up to POA Lead SDM, Problem and Major Incident
Management, and across to the Post Office Service Desk.

6.6 Requests to Disable/Re-Enable Training Controls

Training Controls have been added to the HNG-A/X Applications, which control the roles that Counter
Users are able to logon with and the products that they can trade when logged on. Training Controls
manage access in accordance with training curricula data provided by POL's identity management
system. POL have expressed concerns that the training curricula data that they provide could be mis-
entered or corrupted by the systems providing it (supplied by Accenture) so as to cause a
catastrophic/wide-spread loss of access to HNG-A/X Users.

One approach to resolving such a situation would be for POL to Request that POA disabled Training
Controls, completely, and then re-enable the Controls once the training curricula data had been
corrected. Should such a situation arise, it is likely that it would be recognised during a Major Incident
Service Bridge call. Similarly, it would be during a Major Incident Service Bridge call that POL would
decide on Training Controls disablement, over any other courses of action to resolve (e.g. correcting the
data in their identity management system or continuing with limited trading).

N.B. POL requesting us to disable Training Controls during a Major Incident Service Bridge call is NOT
sufficient authorisation to action that request (see below)

6.6.1 Handling Requests to Disable Training Controls

Whilst discussions for requesting disablement of Training Controls might have occurred during a Major
Incident Service Bridge, disablement should not be carried out until a formal authorised request has been
received.

During the Major Incident service bridge call, should the decision be made to disable Training Controls,
the Post Office signatory who will issue the request to disable Training Controls will be identified to
Fujitsu Services. To enable the Post Office signatory to make the request, after the Service Bridge call
POA Duty Manager will send an email to the identified Post Office signatory requiring Post Office to issue
Fujitsu Services with instructions to make a Request to Disable Training Controls and subsequently a
Request to Re-Enable Training Controls.

The email will contain the text below:

7 Formal Incident Closure & Post Incident Review

7.1 Post Incident Review

The Post Incident Review is chaired by the Major Incident Manager and follows a set agenda which is.
distributed with the Post Incident Review meeting invitation, along with the draft copy of the Major
Incident Report (if available).

The template for writing a Post Incident Review Report is stored in Dimension (hyperlink below) under
SVM/SDM/TEM/2531.

The purpose of a Post Incident Review is:

e To understand the incident that prevented a Service or Services from being delivered.

« To confirm the impact to the business during and after the Incident and agree the number of
branches impacted and duration of Major Incident.

* To confirm the end-to-end recovery process and timeline, and identify that all documented
processes were followed.

e To analyse the management of the incident and the effectiveness of the governance process.

e To identify corrective actions, including agreed Third Party actions, to:
© prevent recurrence of the incident
co minimise future business impact
co improve the procedure for the management of incidents

Output: To confirm details provided in the draft MIR provided to POL update with corrective actions and
redistribute. To also include any of the following as appropriate

e any activities for a Service Improvement Plan

«any Changes and associated TfSNow Change reference.

e any follow up that requires to be progressed via Problem Management
* any improvements to KBsalerting and /or event management

The agreed impact of the Major Incident must be provided for inclusion in the Counter Availability SLT
Figures.

If this review highlights areas where improvements can be made, an agreed Service Improvement Plan
will be produced, using the EMEIA SIP template, with appropriate actions, owners and timescales. It will
also identify any ongoing risks to the service, together with any changes. Service Management will track
all actions to resolution. Third party actions will be reviewed at Service Review meetings.

Consideration should be given as to whether the improvements can be shared across Fujitsu as lessons
learnt, in accordance with Fujitsu EMEIA Business Management System document: Major Incident
Management Process. Please see use the hyperlink below to access this document:

Major_Incident_Management_Process

These are to be documented on the Lessons Learnt portal to help other Accounts to learn from the
failures or success of the major incident activities. As stipulated in the document, there may be situations
when the lessons cannot be shared due to confidentiality reasons.

7.3 Calculating potential LD liability for Major Incidents

Major Incidents which qualify as Failure Events are detailed in the Branch Network Service Description
(SVM/SDM/SD/0011). A Failure Event is defined in this document as an event or series of connected
events which causes one or more Counter Positions to be deemed to be Unavailable due to a Network
Wide Failure or a Local Failure. Ongoing failures will be deemed to be part of such a Failure Event until
the Failure Event is closed in accordance with the Incident closure and Major Incident Review process as
detailed in section 7.0.

For a Failure Event the Incident Closure & Major Incident Review Process will require Post Office and
Fujitsu to agree the number of branches and counter positions affected and the duration of the outage
(rounded to the nearest 30 minutes as detailed in the Network Wide Rounding Table).

Network Wide Rounding Table

8 Fujitsu Roles and Responsibilities during a Major
Incident

This section defines the roles and responsibilities individuals and teams have as part of the Major
Incident Escalation Procedure. The following roles will be laminated and available for the MIM to assign
during a Major Incident.

8.1 Role of the MAC Team

The role of the Major Account Controllers team in the event of a Major Incident is as follows:

« Receive phone calls and log incidents from Post Office IT Service Desk, and communicate the
progress of investigations to the Post Office IT Service Desk.

Notes:

1, There is also a HDI interface between Post Office Service Now and Fujitsu TfSNow systems
so incidents and updates may be automatically transferred as well

2, These incidents are generally considered ‘software’ incidents as hardware and branch network
incidents are no longer managed by Fujitsu.

e Escalation of any Call Threshold Breaches to the POA Duty Manager
« Confirming times and details to Major Incident Manager (MIM)

e Send/update service impact details to the Major Incident Manager. These details will be fed into
the Technical Bridge in real time as requested, whilst details for the overall Major Incident will be
provided to the Major Incident Manager post the incident.

* Be responsible for sending communications as provided by the Major Incident Communications
Manager for the following:-

To send out SMS text messages and attend all Technical Bridges
-SMS to SMS Technical Bridge
To inform of new Major Incidents and provide MI updates of progress to the following
- E Mail Post Office IT Service Desk

8.2 Role of the Major Incident Manager

Major Incident Manager (MIM). This will by default be either the Day Time Duty Manager or OOH Duty
Manager (hours shown in 9.3). However a separate member of the Service Management team may be
appointed as the MIM depending on the situation. The primary role of the MIM in a Major Incident is to
facilitate the management of the Incident through investigation and diagnosis to resolution, with the aim
of making the process as efficient and effective as possible. Upon determining that a Major Incident has
been called, a request for a Technical Recovery Manager (TRM) will be made to the appropriate POA
Service Lead or Senior SDM who will appoint one of his team to be the TRM. The Major Incident
Manager acts as the central point for communication and non-technical information flow, allowing the
TRM to focus on the technical situation and the resolution of the Incident. The Major Incident Manager is
also responsible for creating and maintaining all the associated documentation. For the process to be
effective, all updates and information regarding the incident must be fed to the MIM to update the
timelines and report.

The Major Incident Manager:
e Calls and chairs the Technical Bridge

e Has responsibility for creating the Major Incident Report, using the template defined in section9.1
and ensuring that the applicable information is captured.

e Records the Technical Bridge attendees names so they can be documented in the Major Incident
Report.

e Identifies Business and Service impact though discussions with the users, the Post Office IT
Service Desk and the MAC team — providing this input into the Tech Bridge.

e Distributes the Technical Bridge actions provided by the TRM (if appropriate).
e Assists with communication internally within the POA
e Track time lines

e Along with the POA Problem Manager, ensures that the TRM provides regular updates on any
longer term corrective actions

« Following the resolution of the Incident, schedules and chairs the PIR.

8.3 Role of the Technical Recovery Manager

The primary functions of the Technical Recovery Manager are to co-ordinate and manage the restoration
of service, manage the technical teams, and act as the communication point for the technical teams and
third parties. The function will also include managing all longer term technical corrective actions, e.g.
recommendations for improvements to KBs, eventing and configuration.

The Technical Recovery Manager:
e Manages the technical recovery of the Incident — liaising with SDUs and third parties.

« Provides updates on the recovery, when technicians / representatives of technical teams are
unable to attend the Technical Bridge.

e Is the only person to liaise directly with the technical teams, including technical third parties.

e Provides summarised actions from Technical Bridge to the Major Incident Manager, including:
o Current status including impact and risk
o Advising on potential workarounds.
o Planned recovery activities including timelines

o Root Cause Analysis*, corrective actions, and their corresponding action owners and
timelines (where known)

The TRM will be responsible for attending any meetings and providing appropriate root cause analysis
and corrective action detail. This will also include managing any longer term technical corrective actions
that are documented in the Major Incident Report and will include where appropriate:

e Any activities for a Service Improvement Plan

« Any Changes / TfSNow Change references
«Any Risks

e Any Configuration changes

e  Anyimprovements to KB's, alerting and /or events

e Any associated Peak or TfSNow calls

* For Root Cause Analysis refer to the Fujitsu EMEIA Conduct Root Cause Analysis Procedure.

8.4 Role of the Problem Manager

The Problem Manager ensures that corrective actions / investigations are tracked and completed
following the major incident.

Any corrective actions arising from the Major Incident Review will be added to the Major Incident Report
and also a Problem Record if appropriate, and tracked with POL through to completion. The updates will
be distributed to Post Office as required, and in the case of a Security Major Incident associated with PCI
failures, the POL Security team will also receive a copy of the report.

As Fujitsu have interfaces with 3 parties such as American Express, then liaising with Post Office
representatives from Service and support teams such as the Payments team as well as 3% party
representatives will be required, in order to contain, remove data etc, so the potential PCI\GDPR data
breaches are resolved in a timely manner and with the required authorisations.

8.5 Role of the Communications Manager
