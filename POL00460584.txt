Fujitsu Service Extension & Exit

From a commercial perspective, we need to balance challenging Fujitsu as part of standard Contract
Management assurance while working in partnership to smoothly exit services.

To support this, POL are standing up a team with Fujitsu to assess continuation of Fujitsu / Horizon service
until 2030. This will evaluate opportunities to remove or reduce Fujitsu reliance ahead of this time whilst also
maintaining the IT infrastructure landscape needed to support an effective transition of service.

What improvements have been made to Defect Management?

More robust testing and governance forms a key component to how Horizon system defects are managed.

Defect Definitions Defect Tooling
Consistently identify Leverage consistent tools —
system defects by severity ServiceNow & Jira — to log,
and business impact track and test defects until
resolution

Defect Triage & Thresholds
Bi-weekly meeting with
Fujitsu to discuss system

defects by severity with set

of limits on accepted defect
volumes during testing

Defect Review Forum
Weekly session run by POL
with Suppliers and
stakeholders to monitor
defects status

Defect Criticality
Postmasters and POL
stakeholders assess any
new defect impact to build
understanding and
prioritise urgency for
resolution

Defect Comms
Postmaster facing Branch
Hub & Knowledge Article

issued within 2 day SLA

once defect raised with
status of all current defects

available on Branch Hub

These improvements give Post Office confidence that when Horizon data and system issues are identified, the
right processes and structures are in place to resolve these more quickly.

POL00460584

Horizon Remediation Programme

The Programme was established in 2021 to address the outcomes of the Horizon Issues Judgement (HIJ),
helping re-build Postmaster trust and confidence in the system.

Over the past 3 years, the Programme has achieved a series of important milestones to improve Horizon,
mitigate HIJ findings and ensure the system remains sustainable whilst Post Office continues to use it.
