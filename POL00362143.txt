Chairman’s Statement
A record year for service to customers - but major challenges ahead

Royal Mail has delivered a year of record high quality of service to its customers. Financial performance has also been
outstanding, especially in the face of competition, with an operating profit of £355 million - an increase of 17.5% compared
with last year ~ on record revenues of more than £9 billion.

Parcelforce Worldwide has made a full-year profit for the first time ever and Post Office Limited has performed strongly to
cut its losses in a year that finally saw the end of pension and benefit books. General Logistics Systems (GLS), Royal Mail's
European parcels business, made a record profit and grew its revenues in a market where competition has intensified
strongly.

Our determination to share success with our people and reward them for excellent performance has been underlined with a
£418 Share in Success payment to people across the company, including, for the first time, subpostmasters who are the
backbone of our retailing network. The reward, which will be paid this month, amounts to a pay out of nearly £100 million
and follows last year’s payment of £1,074 to our people for successful delivery of the three-year Renewal Plan. Yet it doesn't
seem that long ago when many doubted the company, which was losing well over £1 million a day in 2002, would again be
profitable or capable of hitting custorner service targets.

We still have a mountain to climb. But last year showed that Royal Mail Group and its people have consolidated the gains we
tmade during the Renewal Plan. There was always a danger that we could have slipped back, that hard-won gains would have
crumbled - but we've sustained our tumaround and must continue to do so. That's a big achievement in itsetf.

Crucially, we need to embark swiftly on the modernisation of Royal Mail. This is the key challenge the whole organisation is
facing. It's an even more daunting task than the Renewal Plan we accomplished and it will test us all.

Putting in new technology and replacing obsolete equipment, in time and to budget; further streamlining our operations and
bringing our people with us at all times: increasing the focus on customers so that we deliver even better service in a market
where rivals are after our business all this will be incredibly stretching, It will mean a great deal of hard work.

Meanwhile, we have to keep pumping cash into our pension fund - perhaps as much as £750 million a year - in order to
fund our pension commitments to employees and clear a deficit that has now reached £5.6 billion. To put the deficit into
stark perspective, it outstrips the Group’s pre deficit net asset value of £2.3 billion by £3.3 billion. We have to find the money
to clear the deficit. It's a challenge that every one of us in the company can’t ignore.

And as hard as anything we do, the task of restructuring the Post Office network must be tackled to deal with chronic losses
on operations of some £2 million a week. It means creating a sustainable future for the rural service, where the majority of
the 7.854 branches are fundamentally loss-making and have needed every penny of the £150 million of funding made
available by the Government to stay open. We await a decision on future funding from the Government but it's down to us to
give the 500 directly managed branches in high streets and shopping malls - currently losing £50 million a year ~ a much
stronger financial base, as well as making the busiest urban branches - directly managed or privately owned - much more
attractive to visit by our customers.

It's all going to be very tough. But it’s encouraging that the building blocks we need are beginning to slot into place. A vital
part of our plans was securing, after lengthy negotiations with Postcomm, a price contro! that allows significant investment in
the business and gives us the ability to increase the cash payments into our pension fund whose deficit now totals £5.6
billion.

We have made tremendous progress in discussions with the Government - Royal Mail Group's shareholder ~ on our
investment case for the future. We put a commercial plan to the Government which we are confident will enhance the value
of the organisation for the shareholder. It is not a Government subsidy but a clear investable case for our shareholder and
im pleased to say that we have reached agreement in principle with Government on this investment case as a whole. There
remains, inevitably, a huge amount of detail to be worked through over the coming weeks, including ensuring we get the
right incentive scheme in place for our people. We know taking our people with us is central to our plans. We believe giving
them a stake in the company would be a huge incentive for our people to achieve the efficiency gains essential if we are to
compete successfully to retain and win customers in the face of tough competition and importantly we know this is
something they want and would respond to. This commercially focused investment from aur shareholder will give us an
opportunity to modernise and transform a business which is vital to the success of UK plc.

We can’t take anything for granted. The mail market opened to full competition and bulk mailers, already active, have in the
last 12 months handled more than one billion letters under access agreements with Royal Mail. Our postmen and
postwomen are still delivering this mail but we've lost revenue as it is transported directly into our mail centres. We face the
prospect of access volumes climbing to three billion items per annurn within the next two years, which would ammount to
around one in seven of the letters we currently handle,

We need to be more efficient. In the letters business, we need a £2 billion investment programme with financing both from
the Government and revenues we generate from turnover to replace ageing and obsolete equipment and put in place new
technology giving us the efficiencies, capabilities and a more flexible cost base in order to compete successfully and provide
the service our customers need.

Chairman's Statement (continued)

The Post Office network also needs investment to give it a sustainable future, We are seeing new revenues from the range of
new products introduced in the last couple of years in the network ~ the most recent have been the instant Saver account
and a credit card - but we have also (ost annual revenues worth £327 million as a result of the loss of traditional benefits
payments. The Post Office Card Account, used by 4.2 million pensioners and benefit recipients, will be phased out by 2010,
and the future of the rural network and the level of future financing available post 2008 lie in Government hands, We
continue to discuss with our shareholder the best way to secure Post Office services going forward. Balancing the need to
Tun the network as efficiently as possible while meeting the social need fulfilled by branches in communities nationwide is a
difficult challenge but it is one we are embracing.

‘The UK parcels market has become even more competitive in the last year, But the hard work the business and its people
have put into restructuring its operations and the focus on delivering high quality service to its 21,000 business customers
has paid off with the first full year of profitability. Parcelforce Worldwide will have to continue to work hard to ensure it stays
profitable in a market that gets tougher every year.

The star performer in the Group in terms of profitability is GLS which saw a 37% increase in profits to £100 million on
revenues which grew strongly to more than £1 billion. I's an outstanding example of the achievernents which flow from a
dedicated focus on customers and efficiency,

In fact, it's what the whole of Royal Mail is seeking to do. Our number one priority remains to deliver consistent, excellent
quality of service to our customers, Underpinning that is an unceasing drive to run all our operations as efficiently as possible
~ and making the right investments in our operations will be crucial to achieving higher productivity. The key to everything we
do is our people. We believe that to give them a real stake in the business will be a powerful incentive for increasing yet
further their commitment and dedication, We have made tremendous progress and have reached agreement in principle with
the 50 Government on the investment case to achieve ail this. The investment case will give us the means to build a successful

Chief Executive's Statement

A solid base to launch transformation
Royal Mail Group's outstanding performance last year shows we now have the sotid base needed to launch the
transformation of the company.

There is a long way to go from the base camp we have consolidated and it will be essential to bring our people with us, all
the way. It is going to be a very tough challenge, more difficult than anything we have achieved so far. But we know we are
capable of success. The task for us now is to get on with the enormous changes needed to ensure we compete successfully
in markets where there are already many competitors. It is going to require a huge commitment from all of us.

Competition and the threat it poses are now part of daily life across Royal Mail. We delivered record customer service last
year but we have to do better. A total focus on our customers, consistently delivering to them the service they expect and
pulling out all the stops to be flexible and responsive to their needs and concerns, must become ingrained into everyone's
daily life if we are to compete successfully. We will develop our products and services and create new ones to benefit our
customers, But we remain a people company and we will only ever be as good as the performance and commitment we ail
give.

\t's right, then, to praise our people for the record performance they have delivered in 2005-06. Over the last year, 94.1% of
First Class letters arrived the day after posting, a record performance well ahead of anything we've previously achieved and
just over a full percentage point above the 93.0% target. Second Class mail was ahead of target too with a 98.8%
performance and the large bulk of business mail services also hit or exceeded their targets. It's a world-class performance
by our people and they can take pride in what they have achieved. I am proud of them.

It was also an outstanding financial performance with the £355 million operating profit - up 17.5% compared to last year ~
triggering a £418 Share in Success payment to our people. They have shown a real commitment to ensuring the operational
changes we made in the three-year Renewal Plan are iow firmly embedded. And they understand, that with competition
growing, we cannot afford to slip back.

All four of Royal Mail Group's businesses improved their financial performance last year. In Letters, there was a decline in
inland addressed mail with the impact exacerbated by some bulk mail customers switching to lower-priced services. The
impact of these adverse effects was offset by a below-inflation price rise and the business made a £344 million operating
profit, a £1 miltion improvement on last year. This performance masks the losses Royal Mail continues to make in fulfilling its
Universal Service “one-price goes anywhere” Obligation as we continue to lose money on First and Second Class stamped
letters.

With competition intensifying and ctear signs that the letters market may well decline further, the need for Royal Mail to drive
efficiency changes is unmistakable. Improving efficiency in a declining market is much tougher than making productivity gains
in a growing one. A key challenge we face is to make rapid progress by investing in new technology and modernising the way
we work.

We remain determined to give a high priority to ensuring the integrity of the mail. We have introduced this year new
management processes, inclusion of mail integrity onto our performance management scorecards, an accountable director
and revised and updated policies. Last year was the first full year that we applied the vetting powers, which Royal Mail sought
and was granted, to check if applicants were attempting to conceal any past criminal convictions. It has armed us with an
additional layer of security. We have also reduced the number of casual employees to around 500 - in marked contrast to
the almost 20,000 employed in the autumn of 2004 and have deployed a new quarterly audit of the security of the mail in
all our mail centres and delivery offices. Our policy remains - zero tolerance to any form of wrongdoing.

Post Office Ltd made an operating loss of £111 million but this was a £12 million improvement on the previous year and
represented a real achievement as it showed solid progress in the business's drive to replace fost revenue from pension and
benefit book payments with growing income from alternative products such as travel, car and home insurance, HomePhone,
foreign currency, a credit card and loans and savings products. But losses of some £2 million a week are unsustainable long-
term in the Post Office network. Restructuring is essential and we continue to discuss with Government the best ways of
creating a stable, sustainable network; we are hopeful these discussions will come to fruition this autumn.

Parcelforce Worldwide's £5 million operating profit - the first full year operating profit the business has ever made - is the
result of a tong haul involving a focus on business customers, exiting from loss-making contracts and cutting costs, while all
the time focusing on delivering quality service by well-motivated people. It's a fantastic achievement but we are in no way
complacent as maintaining profitability in an intensely competitive market is a further tough challenge faced by the business.

General Logistics Systems (GLS) 37% improvement in operating profit to £100 milion with a 9.6% margin on revenue which
grew strongly by 13.6% is another fantastic performance by a company widely recognised as an outstanding campetitor in
the European parcels market. It is now established as a significant contributor to the Group's profits but we know it can
improve its performance further and this is the challenge it faces.

The Group's overall operating profit of £355 million was a fine achievement but it should also be noted that while the margin
‘on our revenue was a creditable 3.9%, it is well below the returns some of our biggest rivals in mail are achieving.

POL00362143

Royal Mail Holdings plc

Chief Executive's Statement (continued)

The building blocks for Royal Mail Group’s modernisation are beginning to fall into place. We have made enormous progress
in securing the funds we need to modernise this business, service the pension fund deficit which needs around £750 million
of cash every year and restructure the Post Office network which tases around £100 million a year. We have reached an
agreement in principle with the Government on our averall investment case and have secured a price control agreement with
Postcomm. Together, these would allow us to modernise the business while making increased payments to the pension fund
under a funding plan that satisfies the independent pension fund trustees. We are also having a constructive dialogue with
the Government on restructuring the Post Office netwark, against a backdrop of Government business across our counters
declining to less than 10% of overall business in our branches in three years’ time.

The years ahead will be harder than anything we've been through before. Every area of our business - letters, parcels and
the services we provide in Post Office branches ~ is under increasing competitive pressure. The days when the company could
rely on customers beating a path to our door have gone forever.

That's why it's so important that Royal Mail Group has secured the agreement in principle of our shareholder to our
investment plan. We will be working to agree the details over corning weeks, including putting the right incentive in place to
reward our people for future success. We believe that a stake in Royal Mail Group - an equal stake for everyone - will
motivate our people and help deliver the transformation we need. Our people are fundamental to our modernisation plans
and we have stressed their role in the commercial investment plan we have submitted the shareholder.

I am also very determined that we make further improvements to benefit them. I want everyone to enjoy working for the
company and that means ensuring they are motivated, they have the right working environment, the tools to do the job and
they are treated properly at all times. Securing the means to tackle the pension deficit is also fundamental to our strategy
and it remains a key action point for us. Rewards, benefits and a real stake in future success are crucial - but they all have to
be earned. It’s not gaing to be easy.

But our vision remains - to be demonstrably the best and most trusted mail company in the world. The challenges are huge
but last year we did indeed take jards realising our goal.

Annual Review 2005-06

Over the past year, the postal market in the UK changed forever - since 1 January 2006, Royal Mail has been facing full
competition. Our future success now depends on competing effectively in a market where customers have real choice.

Competition changes everything but we cannot afford to lose the momentum we built up over our three-year Renewal Plan
and have sustained over the last year. Improving service to customers has continued to be the number one priority of
everyone in the Company during 2005-06. Quality of service performance for both First Class and Second Class mail has
been above target levels for over a year - with 94.1% of First Class mail arriving the day after posting. Providing a consistent
high quality service to customers and giving them value-for-money will continue to be the top priorities in the current year
as these are key to keeping customers, and winning new ones, in a competitive marketplace.

Royal Mail values every letter and takes the security of the mail extremely seriously. The vast majority of our people are
scrupulously honest and trustworthy, and over 99.93% of our annual mailbag of 22 billion items arrives safely at the correct
destination.

Our people - our greatest asset

Royal Mail’s people are our greatest asset and we are committed to making the Royal Mail a great place to work, Engaging
and involving our people is the key to this and that is why we want them to have a stake in the Campany. We hold regular
‘Worktime Listening and Learning sessions to hear and discuss how we are tackling the challenges we face and the direction
in which the Company is moving as well as raising issues of concern to our people.

We have improved basic pay for postmen and postwomen to over £310 per week and in March 2006 we agreed a ground-
breaking productivity scheme with the Communication Workers Union which will set the scene for higher basic pay. The
scheme means that pay will improve as efficiency improves, giving postmen and postwomen, for the first time, a chance to
influence the size of their pay packet. In addition we have implemented a 2.9% increase in their basic pensionable pay.

We continued to tackle bullying and harassment over the past 12 months. By June 2005, we achieved our target of
completing diversity training of 175,000 people in just over 18 months. This was the largest undertaking of its kind by a UK
employer. Our efforts in working to create an inclusive culture throughout the Company where everyone feels valued and
respected were recognised in July 2005 when Royal Mail was awarded the Centrica Diversity Award in the Business in the
Community National Awards for Excellence. Royai Mail also won a bronze award from Race for Opportunity in recognition of
its efforts to support and fully harness the talents of the diverse mix of people we employ and to ensure equal opportunities
for everyone in the business.

We continue to tackle absenteeism across the business, with improved support for people who are off sick and rewarding
those people who do not take any unplanned sick leave. Following the success of our initiatives last year, including a prize
draw to recognise good attendance, we saw a significant increase in the number of people at work on any one-day. We
intend to run a similar scheme going forward to raise attendance levels further.

We also recognise our people who go that bit further in the course of their jobs by inviting customers to nominate Royal Mail
postmen and postwomen who are the unsung heroes in their local community. These individuals could be “1st Class’ charity
fundraisers in their spare time, have performed a public-spirited act or dealt with an emergency whilst out delivering or
collecting the mail, They could also simply be someone who has shown a resounding dedication to delivering a great service
to customers. The 2005-06 overall winner was Helen MacKenzie from Scotland, who helped save the life of a man whose
arm became trapped in machinery.

Supporting good causes

Royal Mail's people have a long history of giving their time and fundraising for good causes and in March 2005 Help the
Hospices was chosen as the organisation's first ever major supported charity, following a Company-wide poll. As part of a
two-year partnership with the national charity of the UK hospice movement, Royal Mail has pledged to match money raised
by its people, up to a limit of £250,000. With the help of its people, Royal Mail hopes to raise £1m averall for Help the
Hospices over the course of the partnership.

Fundraising initiatives have so far included the sale of Christmas angel decorations through larger Post Office® branches,
and the publication of ‘Unseen UK’, a unique collection of photographs taken by postmen and postwomen around the country,
The images range from the everyday to the bizarre - fram buildings, letterboxes and landscapes to wildlife and people, and of
course dogs. Proceeds from the sale of the book are going to Help the Hospices.

Every site across the business has been twinned with a nearby hospice so Royal Mail people are involved directly in their local
communities through their fundraising activities and volunteering. A network of community co-ordinators have been
appointed acrass the business to make it as easy as possible for our peaple to get involved as they want, whether working on.
a regular or a one-off basis with their local hospice.

Additional funds are being raised for the hospice movement through Royal Mail's award-winning payrol! giving scheme - the
largest of its kind in the UK. Over the past 15 years, Royal Mail’s postmen and postwomen have danated more than £27.5m
toa wide range of charities through regular payroll giving.

New opportunities through online shopping

Online shopping has continued to grow over the past 12 months, and Royal Mail continues to provide a range of services to
support the home shopping market, from warehousing and direct marketing expertise to delivery to all 27 million addresses
across the UK and return services. At Christmas, Royal Mail delivered around 2 billion items to customers in the run-up to 25
December, including a record breaking 70 million items that had been ordered over the internet - 15 million more than the
previous year.

The growing popularity of online shopping has seen retailers review their use of catalogues as a sales tool. A Royal Mail
survey of 20 leading retailers conducted last year revealed that catalogues are increasingly being used for generating online
orders as well as traditional sales. Nearly two thirds of the retailers surveyed sent catalogues or brochures to drive online
sales - double the number of five years ago.

Stamp celebrations

Royal Mail's stamps have celebrated a wide range of occasions over the past 12 months. The wedding of HRH Prince Charles
and Mrs Camilla Parker Bowles in April was commemorated by the issue of a miniature sheet capturing two images of the
couple in a relaxed and informal mood, This proved a popular souvenir of the event, with record numbers of stamps sold on
a Saturday, the day of the wedding,

Sporting triumphs were also celebrated on stamps during the year. Landon's successful bid to host the greatest sparting
event in the world in 2012, the Olympics, was marked by a set of stamps capturing images of athletes in motion.

The England cricket team's victory in the Ashes competition was marked by the issue of four stamps featuring images of the
squad. This was the first time that living people other than the Royal Family had appeared so prominently on a set of Royal
Mail special stamps.

Royal Mail teamed up with the United States Postal Service to launch a set of stamps featuring classic characters from
timeless children's illustrated stories. These included Paddington Bear, the Enormous Crocodile and the Very Hungry
Caterpillar, which, true to its character, took two ‘bites’ out of the stamp on which it appeared - the first time Royal Mail has
issued a stamp with holes in it

Young letter writers

Royal Mail's young letter writers competition has attracted over 5 miltion entries since it began 29 years ago - the biggest
letter-writing competition of its kind in the UK. Primary school children throughout the UK are invited to enter the
competition, and this year children were invited to write a First Class letter to anyone, anywhere, The judging panel includes
literacy and education specialists who have the hard task of picking the winner.

Post Office Limited ~ a challenging future

The 14,400-strang network of Past Office® branches continued to grow the range of products and services it offers to the
28 million weekly customers, as well as through sales via the Post Office® website and telephone orders, as the amount of
Government business undertaken through the Post Office® has declined. We have also undertaken a programme of sales
training for our people to give them the skills to selt more of our products.

The Post Office®, in response to a request from the Department of Trade and Industry, has tested a range of innovative
ways - other than the traditional village branch office - of providing Post Office® services in rural areas. These have included
partnerships with local service providers such as the police, mobile services as well as ‘hub and spoke’ arrangements where a
subpostmaster running a branch in a larger village provides Post Office® services in smaller communities in premises such
as a pub or village hall,

‘Over the last year, the Post Office® has extended its financial services products with the launch of a new instant saver
account as well as its ‘two in one’ credit card. The unique feature of the card is a loan-like facility, offering customers the
flexibility to make larger purchases at a discounted fixed rate of interest, together with a competitive rate of interest for
regular purchases. This builds on our success in other financial services ~ last year we handled 14 million foreign currency
transactions, making us the UK's number one provider of foreign exchange services. We are also the largest independent
provider of travel insurance, with annual sales totalling more than one miltion policies.

Since November, Nationwide ‘Flexaccount’ personal current account customers have been able to withdraw their cash and
check their balances at any Post Office® branch free of charge. This is part of our continued cammitment to work closely
with banks and building societies to increase accessibility to their services through our branches. More than one million
customers a day currently withdraw cash through the Post Office® network. The Post Office® now provides current account
banking services to 10 UK banks - with over 22 million current account holders able to access their cash, free of charge, at a
Post Office® branch, Our vision is to be able to offer free access to cash for all current account holders.

Post Office® customers can now buy gift vouchers for a wide range of high street retailers through a partnership with The
Gift Voucher Shop. The vouchers, which include those for ‘enjoyment’ and ‘experience’ days, can be purchased from any Post
Office® branch or ordered over the telephone and the internet. This makes it easy for customers to find and send a gift they
can be sure their family and friends will really want.

The Post Office® entered the home telephony market in January 2005 with its HomePhone service. Twelve months after
launch, the fixed-line residential service had signed up over 260,000 live customers and is currently signing up more than
4,000 custorners a day. Building on this presence in the telecoms market, the Post Office® launched a directory enquiries
service in January 2006 - with call costs cheaper than the two largest rival numbers in the market based on a one-minute
call from most UK landlines.

Parcels - in the UK and around the world

In the parcels market, Parcelforce Worldwide has continued to establish itself as a key player in the competitive, non-
regulated express parcels delivery service. It delivers same 45 million parcels a year, to customers in 239 countries and
territories across the world. Achieving a full year operating profit - £5 million - for the first time was a fantastic achievement
by the business,

Parcelforce Worldwide is the UK partner of General Logistics Systems (GLS), our European parcels business. GLS handles
over 1 million parcels a day through its network of nearly 700 depots and central transhipment points. its core operation is
business-to-business parcels deliveries and it has 220,000 customers in 34 states across Europe. GLS's 37% improvement in
operating profit was another fantastic performance, underlining the business's reputation as one of the most admired parcel

March 2001. The framework for change was the Postal Services Act 2000 that created a commercially focused company
with a more strategic relationship with the Government. The Postal Services Act also established a new regulatory regime
with an independent Regulator, Postcomm, and a reformed consumer body, Postwatch, Royal Mail Holdings plc together with
its subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures comprise ‘the Group’

The Group has over 370 years experience of providing the public with postal services - through our trusted brands we reach
everyone every working day in mail, parcels and express services and through our Post Office® branches. Our market place
is, however, rapidly changing: Government revenue, such as benefit payments, is being tost from Post Office Limited whilst
the UK mails market has been fully liberalised since January 2006, resulting in full competition.

We are providing new services to meet these challenges - from a range of new Post Office® financial services including
personal loans and a ‘two-in-one’ credit card, to electronic ‘stamps’, online shopping fulfilment and mail-related data tools to
help companies improve their marketing performance. Our continued aim is to put the customer at the heart of everything
we do by - increasing value through excellent quality of service, our unique reach to every address in the UK, enhancing our
trusted brands, becorning easier to do business with, retaining our profitable business, and developing innovative products
and services for our customers.

Governance

The EU Accounts Modemisation Directive (AMD) requires a mandatory addition to the existing Directors’ Report to provide an
enhanced review of a company's business far accounting years beginning from 1 April 2005. The Directive states that the
review should provide a balanced and comprehensive analysis of the development, performance and position of the
Company's business. The analysis should include both financial and, where appropriate, non-financial key performance
indicators (KPIs) relevant to the particular business, It is recognised that to the extent that this information appears in the
Operating and Financial Review (OFR), it does not need to be discussed in the Directors’ Report.

Although our reporting dates mean that the Group does not have to comply with the Directive until 2007, in fine with our
commitment to comply with best practice and achieve the highest standards of Corporate Governance, the Group has moved
towards full compliance with the new requirement early via an enhancement of the OFR. The report provides a ‘snapshot’ of
the Company at a moment in time addressing the requirements of the EU AMD, including the principal risks and uncertainties
facing the organisation.

In the following analysis, all references to operating profit are before exceptional items.

This year we report an operating profit of £355m compared to £302m for 2004-05, an increase of £53m or 17.5% mainly driven by the
performance of our unregulated parcels businesses. All operational business units contributed to this increase, with General Logistics
Systems improving profitability by £27m (37.0%), Post Office Limited by £12m (9.8%), Parcetforce Worldwide by £21m (>100%) and Royal

External revenue

Group external revenue increased by £100m (1.1%) from £8,956m to £9,056m driven primarily by increases in Royal Mail and GLS.

Royal Mail increased its revenue by £96m (1.4%) of which £118m arose from domestic mail price increases of 1.7%, £95m (1.4%) from
non-addressed and international products, offset by underlying inland addressed mail votume decline of €50m (0.7%), a £5m (0.1%)
negative mix impact and a £62m (0.9%) negative impact relating to customers switching to the cheaper Downstream Access products.

General Logistics Systems increased its revenue by £124m (13.6%) from £913m to £1,037m, mainly due to volume growth. Parcelforce
Worldwide increased its revenue by £16m (5.4%) from £298m to £31.4m reflecting higher volumes from increases in national account
products and favourable product mix, Post Office Limited reported a revenue decrease of £138m (14.1%) from £976m to £838m,
primarily as a result of the expected erosion of traditional benefits volumes, partially offset by new revenues.

Costs (excluding exceptional iterns)
Total costs of £8,733m have increased by £54m (0.6%). which is well belaw inflation.

People costs of £5,968m represent 68.3% of the Group's cost base and have increased year-on-year by £129m (2.24). This is partly due
to pay increasing for the majority of our frontline people from ‘1st April 2005 of 3.8% being offset by decreases in overtime, contract
labour and subpostmasters’ costs. During December 2004, the status of Romnec Limited changed from a joint venture to a subsidiary,
which impacted how we accounted for Rornec costs. This change had the effect of increasing people casts in the current year by around
£70m compared to prior year (accounting for 54%, of the £129m increase), with a corresponding reduction to non-people costs.

Distribution and conveyance costs of £1,218m, representing 13.9% of the Group's cost base, have increased by £35m (3.0%), driven
mainly by increased volumes in GLS.

Other operating charges of £1.547m representing 17.7% of the Group's cost base have decreased by £113m (6.8%) due to continuing
efficiency improvements in a number of areas, including central support functions and property costs.

Share of profits in associates and joint ventures

The Group's share of profits in associates and joint ventures of £32m (2005 £28m) comprises profits of £44m (2005 £39m) from
Camelot, POL's Bureau de Change joint venture (First Rate Exchange Services Limited), Quadrant our catering associate and G3
Worldwide Mail N.V. (Spring), offset by a loss of £9m (2005 loss of £111m) from Bank of Ireland's financial services venture with Post
Office Limited. The losses from Post Office Financial Services were expected and are a result of sales and marketing expenditure to
promote new products.

Net exceptional items (including operational exceptional items and profits/(losses) relating to business and property disposals)

Net exceptional costs of £143m (2005 £210m) comprise £91m (2005 £218m) relating to the Share in Success payments, £44m (2005
£23m) for impairment and £75m (2005 £36m) for redundancy costs, offset by profits of £67m (2005 £67m) from property and business
disposals.

Net finance income

Net finance income of £100m (2005 £75m) comprises notional pension interest of £101m (2005 £59m), interest earned on investments
of £48m (2005 £55m) and other interest receivable of £3m (2005 £3m), offset by interest payable on loans of £48m (2005 £36m) and
other interest payable of £4m (2005 £6m). Interest earned on investments decreased by £7m due to lower average investment balances,
because of the funding of POL's loss making social network, offset by higher interest rates. Interest payable increased primarily due to
higher average borrowings in our Post Office® network needed to fund benefits payments. The notional pension finance income has
increased by £42m due to higher returns on pension scheme assets more than offsetting interest cost on higher pension scheme
fiabilities.

Taxation
The taxation credit of £83m (reported rate -27%) comprises £25m current tax payable on overseas profits; a £7m deferred tax credit with
respect to overseas operations; a UK current tax charge of £1.1m and a UK deferred tax credit of €£142m. Last year a charge of £16m
was recorded comprising €8m current tax charge with respect to UK operations; a £12m current tax charge on overseas profits; a £19m
UK deferred tax charge and a £23m overseas deferred tax credit. The negative reported rate is mainly due to the increased amount of
deferred tax asset recognised

Group strategy
The following supports our Operating Units’ objectives:

Customers

Our customers are at the heart of everything we do. The key to winning and keeping customers is to provide a consistently high quality of
service (Qof5) - this has been the number one priority of everyone in the business over the past year, and it is at the heart of our strategy
moving forward. That means delivering a high quality of service and mail integrity, developing products that really match the needs of our
customers and provide value for money, as well as becoming easier to do business with.

People

The ‘Great Place to Work initiative, which has been established within the organisation since 2003, works on the basis that we can only
move forward and succeed as a business if we involve our people in making change happen. The plan focuses on engaging and involving
people in managing and improving their workplace.

Profitability and cash flow

Ensuring a sustainable and reasonable level of profitability and cashflow is key so we can reinvest in our future and eventually provide a
commercial return to our stakeholder. The Group is seeking to address the historic underinvestment it has seen in its Letters business,
along with continuing to develop better and more efficient ways of working. This will help to ensure we are flexible and efficient enough to
succeed in a competitive marketplace.

Corporate citizenship
Corporate Social Responsibility in the Group is doing the right thing for our people, our business and the communities we operate in.

We do the right thing because our:
* customers want to buy from companies that share their values:

sand

© colleagues want to work for companies that provide a healthy and safe environment and whose values align to thei
* communities want companies that create the incomes, the jobs and contribute to the cohesion that builds the neighbourhoods
where people want to live and work.

These key strategies and objectives are communicated widely across the Group, embedded into its day-to-day activities and measured on
a timely basis by appropriate KPI's and monitored by the Royal Mail Holdings Board and its sub Committee. The major KPI's are

Treasury management

The Group operates a central Treasury function that manages some £1bn of current asset investments, £866m of borrowings and
£829m of cash primarily in the Post Office® network, in accordance with investment restrictions set by the Government. It also acts as
internat banker for the Group's business units. The Group finances its operations largely through retained profits and borrowings.

Group Treasury derives its authority from the Royal Mail Holdings plc Board, and provides quarterly monitoring reports for their review.
‘The Treasury function only has the authority to undertake financial transactions relating to the management of the underlying business
risks and it does not engage in speculative transactions and does not operate as a profit centre, All strategies are risk averse, and the
treasury policy has remained unchanged during the year. The principal financial instruments for liquidity management are deposits and
short-term borrowings: and for commodity and currency hedging are spot/forward purchases, and swaps.

The Group is financed from the following facilities provided by the DT] and HM Treasury:

The terms of the Government borrowing facility and the associated Framework Agreement impose strict constraints on the separation of
cash funds within the Royal Mail Group and the purposes for which they can be used.

The principal treasury risks arising from the Group's activities are currency, counterparty, commodity (fuel) and liquidity risk. These are
managed as follows:

= the Group is exposed to foreign currency risk due to Royal Mail International's obligation to pay overseas postal operators for
carrying UK mail abroad, revaluation of the currency balances held to operate the Bureau de Change services within Post Office
Limited and various sales and purchase contracts denominated in foreign currency. Hedging programmes managed by Group
Treasury mitigate these risks. Where possible, exposures are netted internally and any remaining exposure is hedged using a
combination of external spot and forward contracts;

the Group's obligation to pay overseas postal operators is denominated in Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) - a basket currency
comprising of US Dollar (USD), Japanese Yen, Sterling and euro. The Group has a policy of matching receipts and payments for
individuat currencies where possible and then hedging any material net exposure. The policy is that up to 80% of the forecast
net exposure is hedged with agreement of the internal business unit. Group Treasury operates a rolling 18-month programme,
which is subsequently reviewed on a quarterly basis. There has been no external hedge in place throughout the financial year
2005-06 due to there being no material net exposure:

= Bureau de Change balances are grouped into baskets of closely correlated currencies. Each currency basket (e.g. USD or euro)
is then sold forward creating a liability to match the underlying asset;

* significant foreign currency risk arising from sales and purchase contracts, primarily in USD and euro, may be hedged up to
100% depending upon the reliability of the forecast of the underlying cash flows;

* the Group does not hedge the translation exposure created by the net assets of its overseas subsidiaries;

= the Group is exposed to fuel risk arising from operating one of the largest vehicle fleets in Europe, which consumes over 150
million litres of fuel per year, and a jet fuel risk from the purchasing of air freight services. The Group's fuel risk management
strategy aims to reduce uncertainty created by the movements in the oil and foreign currency markets. The strategy operates
within the parameters set by the Board, which allow the use of over-the-counter derivative products to manage these
exposures; and

= counterparty risk is managed by limiting aggregate exposure to any individual counterparty based on their financial strength.
These exposures are reviewed regularly and adjusted as appropriate.

The policies for financial assets - investments and derivative financial instruments are shown in note 2.

Regulation

Until the last few years, Royal Mail had enjoyed a monopoly status in the UK letters industry. However, in 2000 the Postal Services Act
created an independent postal Regulator - Postcomm - and allowed Royal Mail to have greater commercial freedom. Postcomm regulates

the prices of nearly 90% of Royal Mail's letters business, controls the terms and conditions for nearly all its services, fixes the quality of
service targets in its Licence with Royal Mail Group plc and determines compensation arrangements.

An overview of significant regulatory events since Pastcomm was created is highlighted below:

personal loan etc), its HomePhone and directory enquiries services etc. These products are, however, in direct competition with
services offered by banks, insurance and telephony companies, as are many of the services it has traditionally offered, e.9. bill
payments, renewal of car tax discs, travel services etc;

= Royal Mail has faced competition via ‘Downstream Access’ (OSA) agreements with companies since February 2004. DSA allows
competitors to collect and sort mailings of 4,000 items or more, before handing them over to us via our mail centres. Our
postmen and women then deliver these items the ‘final mile’ and last year we delivered over 1 billion DSA items - the volume
Postcomm had anticipated Royal Mail reaching within four years. Since January 2006, the UK mail market has been fully
liberalised so competitors are able to offer customers the opportunity of an end-to-end service for collection, sorting and
delivery of their mail. While Royal Mail has to maintain its universal service obligation, competitors have no such obligation and
are therefore able to target the most profitable areas of the letters business: and

* Royal Mai’s previous monopoly position has created an imbalance in prices, which do not reflect the cost of handling the mait.
For Royal Mail to compete effectively in an open market, its postage prices need to reflect its costs. Rebalancing these prices will
benefit some users more than others but it would stimulate innovative pricing structures giving consideration to customer base,
presentation, timing and planning of postings, tocation of both posting and delivery, speed of posting and mechanisation of
posting.

Changing markets
On top of this liberalisation, the market faces changes including:

© e-substitution - the role of mail is changing as people are increasingly using a wider number of channels for communication,
including email, mobile telephone calls and texting etc. This offers an opportunity as well as a challenge to keep mail relevant to
customers;

« _ e-fulfilment - the use of the Internet as a sales channel has and continues to increase demand for end-to-end delivery of
packets and parcels at affordable prices; and

< _advertising/Direct Mail - the use of mass mail advertising campaigns tends to reflect the health of the UK economy. Companies
are also developing as more innovative, targeted campaigns based on greater sales intelligence and greater integration with
other mediums.

While these changes present risks and challenges to Royal Mail they also present significant opportunities to work with our customers to
deliver the service they need for their companies to succeed.

Macroeconomics
There are a number of macroeconomic issues that will impact the Group over 2006-07:

© Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2006-07 is forecast to come in below trend at 2%. These low rates of increase may impact
letter traffic growth aver the next 2 years;

overall inflation is low, this will impact on both our prices, as our prices are based on an RPI-x formula, but also our costs;
* gas, electricity and oil prices are set to remain high, which will add to the Group's costs; and

© despite increasing unemployment and a poor economic outlook in certain areas of the country, full employment will continue
elsewhere - leading to a challenge to contain high rates of natural turnover of our people.

Corporate Social Responsibility

Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a key component in supporting the business to be recagnised as a responsible organisation that.
seeks to optimise the beneficial impacts inherent in our business and reduce the negative impacts. Through improving our CSR
performance and ensuring it is integrated into the way we work, we can make ourselves more productive and competitive, we are working
to reduce the number of accidents, reduce our production of CO2 and make our people healthier. We recognise that the route to achieving
and sustaining our goals is through our people and our relationship with customers, business partners, suppliers, communities and other
stakeholders.

A more comprehensive overview of our CSR will be found in the 2006 Corporate Social Responsibility report, published in September
2006.

Key Relationships
Royal Mail has several key relationships that are critical to its day-to-day activities and its overall success,

People - Our people are the lifeblood of the organisation and brands. Without their continued support and dedication it wil! be impossible
to function on a day-to-day basis and embrace the change within our markets. Training, diversity, flexible resourcing and making the
business a great place to work are same of the ways we continue to improve this relationship.

Unions - The Communications Workers Union (CWU) represents non-managerial staff, with the Communication Managers Association
{CMA) representing managerial staff. The Company's policy is to work with the CWU and CMA to engage staff in the development and
execution of business decisions.

Pension trustees - Our pension trustees comprise an independent body of 10 people including employees, union representatives,
pensioners and independent members. They take professional advice, including from Watson Wyatt LLP (actuary) and
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. They are responsible for full and interim valuations and agreeing with Royal Mail appropriate funding for
the pension schemes. The pension trustees now face increasing regulation from the pensions regulator, which was created in the
Pensions Act 2004.

Subpostmasters - The vast majority of Post Office Limited's 14,376 Post Office® branches are operated by subpostmasters and franchise
partners, The National Federation of Subpostmasters (NFSP) represents subpostmasters and currently has approximately 9,300 members.
Post Office Limited conducts annual remuneration negotiations with the NFSP and work closely to support a viable network. The NFSP is
separately a very active body lobbying Government, regulators and consumer bodies, There are several major retailers who are also
significant partners operating between them around 1,700 branches across the country. Post Office Limited liaises closely with these
companies to maintain successful working relationships. It is through effective partnership with these various organisations that the business
takes into account the interests of agents and seeks to support the achievement of their sales potential and longer-term network viability.

Customers - The Group's businesses and brands are used or recognised by almost everyone in the UK ~ from the largest of companies to
individuals. However, the 30 largest customers generate almost 14% of Group turnover and consequently Royal Mail is reliant on a small
custorner base. As competition increases the Group will have to continue to simplify ways of doing business and design products around
customers’ needs. Customers are offered standard terms and conditions for the markets and countries in which the Group operate.

Suppliers - The Group has a wide range of suppliers, with its primary reliance on those relating to outsourcing of non-core services, such
as IT support. It works in partnership with its suppliers to ensure the right products/services are delivered at the right time at competitive
costs. A central purchasing team monitor compliance to Group policy in awarding contracts or new business and adheres to agreed credit
terms.

The Regulator: Postcomm - 90% of Royal Mail letters’ revenues are price-controlled and the price control is set periodically by Postcomm
in the form of a cap on the average price of a basket of products. The price increases or reductions allowed by Postcomm through the
price control have a very material impact on the likely levels of cash flow the company can generate. Postcomm also investigates
compliance with licence conditions and has broad powers to publicly reprimand or fine the Company if it finds it in breach of those
conditions,

The consumer body: Postwatch - Postwatch’s role is to act as a consumer advocate in postal matters. Its public views on the effect of
Royal Mail's policies and management actions on custorners can have a damaging effect on Royal Mail's reputation, regardless of the
quality of service achieved. This can translate into increased customer complaints.

Shareholder ~ The Group is a plc that is 100% owned by the Government. The Shareholder Executive (within the Department of Trade and
Industry) manages the shareholder relationship with Royal Mail as a commercial shareholder. While management of the company
therefore fies with the Board of Directors, the shareholder is kept up-to-date through quarterly performance reviews and is asked
annually to approve the Company's business plan. Any new funding required by the company can only come from Government and can
only be approved by the Shareholder Executive if it meets market economic investor principles.

Royal Mail's £1m operating profit improvement from £343m to £344m is due to a 1.4% improvement in revenue growth (but versus a
3.2% growth in the corresponding period last year). The revenue growth of £96m is mainly due to tariff increases of £118m (1.72) arising
mainly from domestic mail, £95m (1.4%) from non-addressed and international products, offset by underlying intand addressed mail
volume decline of 0.7% (£50m), a £5m (0.1%) negative mix impact and a 0.9% (£62m) negative impact relating to customners switching to
the cheaper Downstream Access products. There is limited scope to reduce operational costs in the short term due to our Universal
Service Obligations.

General Logistics Systems 2006 2005 External revenue rose by 124m (13.6%) from £913m to £1,037m. The

higher than last year but this includes absorbing 7% additional volumes. The second half of the year saw an acceleration of unit cost

Although Post Office Limited saw substantial revenue losses it succeeded in reducing losses from £123m to £141m. The loss of the

Financial Services activity, together with continued improvements in overall cost efficiency, The £114m loss includes the cost of
maintaining the uneconomic part of the rural network. Had this activity been funded by an arm's length commercial contract with
Government, Post Office Limited would have made a profit.

Way forward

The Group has registered a strong profit growth in the first year post Renewal Plan whilst at the same time delivering excellent quality of
service. This is also the fourth consecutive year of underlying growth in profitability, driven this year by our unregulated parcels
businesses which continue to increase volumes, revenues, margin and profit; Post Office Limited reducing its losses in the face of
significant volume and revenue decline; and Royat Mail managing its costs to mitigate the material loss of volumes to lower priced access
products. However, this performance needs to be considered in the context that the Group still only generates a 3.9% return on sales,
which is considerably below that of our competitors, and that both Royal Mail and Post office Limited continue to support significant toss
making products or sectors - Royal Mait continues to make losses on stamps, whilst part of the Post Office Limited network continues to
make losses.

Royal Mail has recently indicated to Postcornm that it is ready to accept Postcomm's proposals for the third price control for the next four
years, but finds itself further burdened by restrictions on its ability to change its non-price terms at a time when markets are being
opened and flexi will be key. It also expects to see further volume toss to Downstream Access over and above the 1 billion loss in
2005-06. However, Royal Mail continues to drive efficiencies, but now must significantly invest in its network to ensure it can continue to
do so and compete with domestic and European rivals.

Post Office Limited expects to lose further revenues over the short term and will continue to try to find new revenues and reduce its cost
base - this is becoming increasingly difficult. Our parcels businesses are expected to grow, albeit at lower rates than experienced in the
past, due in part to the industry-wide consolidation that is taking place.

But our biggest hurdles by far are tackling our £5.6bn pension deficit whilst ensuring that the Group has an appropriate financing package
‘to permit Royal Mait to invest in its network, provide a long term sustainable solution to Post Office Limited's loss-making branches, the

rebalancing of prices within Royal Mail, and to provide adequate headroom to manage the significant commercial risks with respect to
liberalisation and the loss of traditional revenues within Post Office Limited.

Risks Disclosures

The Group uses a business-wide framework for the identification, assessment, treatment, monitoring and reporting of risk. The process
helps support the business objectives by linking into business strategy, identifying and reacting to emerging risks, developing cost effective
solutions to risk and, where appropriate. exploiting risks to gain competitive advantage.

Group-level risks have been identified and are being managed to support the long-term sustainability of the Group:

‘The Group operates in an environment subject to regulation, which imposes restrictions on operations and the risk of penalties for non-
compliance

The Postal Services Commission (Postcomm) issued to Royal Mail a 15-year operating licence in March 2001. The Licence contains
material restrictions on the operation of Royal Mail's business, including restricting its freedom to set its own prices and requiring it to
permit competitors access to its downstream delivery network. If Royal Mail breaches certain licence conditions it may be subject to
compensation payments and fines. There is inevitable uncertainty as to how the regulatory regime will affect Royal Mail in the future,
possibly to the detriment of the Group's profitability.

Royal Mail, unlike other postal licence holders, is obliged by its licence to provide a ‘Universal Service’, resulting in a higher, less flexible
cost base than its competitors

Royal Mail's licence requires it to comply with the Universal Service Obligation (USO). This means that a letter must be delivered within the
UK for the same price irrespective of the distance or remoteness of the destination. The USO also requires one delivery of mail for every
UK househald and business, and one callection of mail, six days a week. This is still a requirement for us in the now fully liberalised
market, resulting in a higher and less flexible cost base in comparison to our competitors. However, the USO ensures Royal Mail has the
largest, distribution network in the country - which may present future opportunities.

Liberalisation of the UK‘s postal markets may lead to competitors ‘cherry picking’ the most profitable customers, which could adversely
affect revenues and profitability

As of 1 January 2006 Royal Mail was subject to full competition, Rival companies have been able to collect, sort and then access our
network via ‘Downstream Access’ since 2004. However, a fully liberalised UK mail market means that competitors can by-pass our
network altogether. With 80% of Royal Mail's revenue coming from its business customers, it will be these customers that competitors
target but without the licence stipulation of a USO.

Ease of entry into, and exit from, the UK postal market could distort the market leading to volume volatility

A number of competitors who are not established postal service providers may initially enter the UK postal market and then rapidly exit. If
this is the case it will distort the market and be increasingly difficult to plan and accurately forecast the future capacity requirements,

The increasing substitution by alternatives to mail delivery services could lead to declining volumes, which would have an adverse impact
on profit

Business mail is an integral part of our business, delivering items for organisations such as Government departments, utilities, financial
services, local authorities and charities. Technologies such as e-mail and the intemet can be used to send information or make available
such information faster and, in many cases, at a lower cost than traditional mail services. Many organisations are now giving incentives to
customers to take up these alternatives. If substitution continues, mails volumes will decrease resulting in the associated fall in revenue.
Due to the USO however, Royal Mail will need to continue to maintain a comprehensive delivery network. As a result costs will not
decrease in line with decreasing volumes. This would have an adverse impact on profitability.

Royal Mail is largely dependent on the Regulator for its pricing, which could resutt in pricing inflexibility

Royat Mail's prices far most of its letters products are determined by price control reviews and negotiations with Postcomm. Although
such prices are well defined by a regulatory formula, Royal Mail's ability to rebalance its prices to better reflect the costs of handling the
mail is dependent on Postcomm, Royal Mail has some of the cheapest stamp prices in Europe, as historically business mail has subsidised
the losses made on stamped mail. Unless the applicable regulatory restraints permit Royal Mail to recover frorn this imbalance, there is a
risk that Royal Mail will always ase money on stamped mail, whilst its competitors cream-skim more profitable products such as business
mail.

Royal Mail derives a significant amount of its revenue from a relatively small number of customers; if a number of these were lost it
would have an adverse impact on profit

Competitors are successfully targeting larger customers and the most profitable areas of this business, yet will not be required to comply
with the Universal Service Obligation (USO). Also, socioeconomic changes are leading to a decline in mail volumes, Due to the USO,
however, costs may not decrease in line with falling volumes. This may have an adverse impact on profitability unless the Group can flex
its operational cost base.

If the UK's economy slows or goes into recession this is likely to have a detrimental impact on the Group's profits

The global economy is in the midst of a radical transformation, with far-reaching and fundamental changes for the pattern of economic
activity. These changes pose challenges and opportunities for the UK and all advanced economies. Historically there has been a correlation
between the state of the UK economy and level of revenue, if the economy continues to slow or goes into recession it will have a direct
impact on mail volumes, and consequently on the Group's profits.

Operating and Financial Review (continued)

The Group has a unique relationship with the Government, which may be affected by any future change in Government policy

The Government is Royal Mail's only shareholder. The influence of public policy considerations on Government thinking may adversely
affect the Group's ability to promote an effective business strategy. This is particutarly significant in the case of Post Office Limited, which
is frequently viewed as a public service provider but is required to run its branch network as a commercial business. The Government's
policy in relation to the social value of rural Post Office® branches may have a prejudicial effect on Post Office Limited’s ability to run an
efficient and profitable retail network, since rural branches are fundamentally unviable without material financial support from the
Government. Furthermore, a change in Government or its thinking may {ead to a different perception of the business and different
requirements, which may have an impact on the fong-term strategy of the business.

‘The Group is subject to changes in both domestic and European regulation and legislation, which could expose it to possible additional
costs

Various recent proposed changes to European or domestic law will have a direct impact on the Group: such as the European Working
Time Directive, International Financial Reporting Standards, speed restrictions on our vehicles and increased liberalisation of the market
for postal service providers. Any future changes may have a material impact on the Group and its individual business units.

Post Office Limited is now an appointed representative of the Bank of Ireland who are authorised and regulated by the FSA and has to
satisfy them that it is meeting the relevant regulatory requirements. It is also subject to anti-money laundering regulations issued under
the Proceeds of the Crime Act and enforced by HM Revenue and Customs. In 2005 Post Office Limited entered the telecommunications
market and is licensed as a telephone service provider by OFCOM, OFCOM has issued a Code of Conduct that service providers must
adhere to.

The business is people centred and depends on quality employees to be able to deliver its objectives

Royal Mail is one of the largest employers in the UK, employing about 193,000 people throughout its UK operations. Currently
employment within the UK is at an all time high leading to potential skills shortages and competition between employers for staff. This
combined with the fact that some areas of the country in which Royal Mail operates have a high natural turnover in staff, could lead to a
Potential shortage in the number and/or quality of available new recruits.

Without a continued change of culture within the organisation future development may be affected

The nature of the organisation relies on a large number of unionised people to ensure continuity and quality of service. The business has
undergone a huge amount of operational change, and while this has produced a return to profitability it has also coincided with a
changing market place; both in terms of financial pressures from competition and regulation and increased customer expectations, Due to
these emerging pressures future growth and development needs to be supported by a cultural change within the organisation. Without a
flexible, efficient and cooperative culture, Royal Mail could quickly become loss-making in an apen market as mail volumes decline, labour
rates increase, and customers have a choice of postal operator. In the event of significant industrial action this could have a major
detrimental effect on the Group's reputation and profits.

The Group relies on a number of key suppliers and could be at risk from adverse changes in price or performance

There are certain critical suppliers to the Group. If for some reason any of thern were unable to meet their service obligations or were to
increase prices significantly, this would adversely impact Royal Mait’s operations and results

The Group's business activities are time critical. This means that if certain infrastructure facilities were disrupted it would have an impact
on our business and operating results

The Group operates 14,376 retail outlets and a complex nationwide network delivering to every postal address in the UK. The business is
subject to a number of operational risks outside its control, including natural disasters, fie, flood, explosion, possibility of work stoppages
or civil unrest, transport infrastructure disruption, power failures, breakdown or failure of equipment, health pandemics, terrorism and the
normal hazards associated with running a complex infrastructure. Any such disruption would have an adverse impact on business and
operating results.

Insufficient investment in the operational network could affect productivity levels and our ability to compete effectively in a liberalised
market

To maintain and improve on our business and operational performance, large an-going investments in infrastructure are required. An
historic underinvestment has lead to equipment and technology nearing the end of its life cycle without being replaced with new
technology. A continued lack of investment in the Group's operational network could lead to an inability to compete effectively in an open
market, due to deterioration in productivity levels or an inability to improve productivity in comparison to its competitors.

The Group's brands are amongst the most recognised and most trusted in the UK; however, our reputation may be adversely affected by
Teports of poor customer service
The Group's brands - Royal Mail, Post Office® and Parcelforce Worldwide are some of the most well-known and trusted brands in the UK

and therefore major intangible assets of the Group. Negative perceptions of these brands and may lead to a loss in confidence and
potential loss in revenue, profits and cash flow.

Royal Mail Holdings plc
Operating and Financial Review (continued)

The Group operates a substantia! treasury operation, which is subject to financial exposures

Group Treasury is responsible for the liquidity of the Group and its subsidiaries. The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk and fuel
price risk. The former is due to Royal Mail international division's obligation to pay overseas postal operators for carrying UK mail abroad
and the balances held to operate the bureau de change services within Post Office Limited. The fuel price risk arises from operating one of
the largest vehicle fleets in Europe, which consumes over 150 million litres of fuel per year, and a jet fuel risk from the purchasing of air
freight services.

If the treasury strategy is inappropriate to cover the Group's exposures this could result in funds not being readily available when required
to pay liabilities or having a negative impact on profit due to increased costs,

The Group has a pension scheme deficit, which is subject to any volatile movements in actuarial assumptions and equity values

Royal Mail operates the 6th largest occupational pension scheme within the UK. It has some 170,000 active members and 279,000
pensioners/deferred pensioners. Due to its relative size to the Company (£5.6bn of pension liability compared to £2.3bn company net
assets excluding the pension deficit), and the longer life expectancy of people, even minor changes to assumptions used to calculate
pension costs and liabilities could have a severe impact on the Group's balance sheet. This, combined with the fact that asset values are
dependent on the UK equity markets, means that there can be large volatility in the pension costs recorded in the income statement and
the deficit recorded in the balance sheet.

Royal Mail Group pic's balance sheet has liabilities that exceed its assets, which could lead ta various exposures, not least that the Licence
to operate could be terminated

Royal Mail Group plc's negative balance sheet is due to the pensions deficit exceeding the Company's assets. This may lead to a number of
remote risk exposures: Royal Mail's postal licence could be terminated with 24 hours’ notice, and certain commercial customer and
supplier agreements may be terminated.

Directors’ Report (continued)
Our people strategy will ensure We realise our potential as an organisation through the strength of our people by developing a high~

identifying and developing in all our people a set of core behaviours that determine haw we treat each ather, our customers and

through the business - from local level up to Board level

Corporate Governance

Statement by the Directors on compliance with the Combined Code

The Board is committed to high standards of Corporate Governance and supports the Combined Code on Corporate Governance (the
Code), published in July 2003, which took effect for Royal Mail on 29 March 2004. The following statement is intended to explain our
governance policies and practices in light of the Code principles and provisions in so far as they are appropriate to a public company with
a single shareholder, and to provide insight into how the Board and management run the business far the benefit of the Shareholder. The
Company has fully complied with the provisions of the Code.

The Board

The Board is responsible for setting the objectives and strategy of the Group and for monitoring performance. The Board currently
comprises a Non Executive Chairman, six Executive Directors and seven Non Executive Directors, There is currently a vacancy for a Group
Finance Director. The biographies of each of the Directors, setting out their current roles, commitments and previous experience, are on
pages 27 and 28. The Board usually meets monthly, and has defined those matters that are reserved exclusively for its consideration.
These include the approval of financial statements, acquisitions and disposals, material agreements, non-recurring projects, major capital
expenditure and strategic plans. It also delegates responsibilities to the Board Committees detailed below. For each scheduled meeting of
the Board, the Company Secretary, on behalf of the Chairman, collates and circulates the papers, aiming to allow sufficient time for the
Directors to review the information provided. The Board is confident that all its members have the knowledge, talent and experience to
perform the functions required of a Director of the business. Executive Directors have rolling 12-manth contracts and Non Executive
Directors are generally appointed for a three-year term.

The Board considers that each of the seven Nan Executive Directors is independent. This means that in the view of the Board, they have
no links to the Executive Directors and other managers, and no business or other relationship with the Company that could interfere with
their judgement. Sir Michael Hodgkinson is the Senior Independent Director. There is also a clear division of responsibilities between the
Chairman and the Chief Executive. Performance evaluation of the Board, its Committees and individual Directors takes place on an annual
basis. The Board initiated a systematic approach to the evaluation of the effectiveness of the Board, its Committees and individual
Directors. This was undertaken by the Chairman and implemented in collaboration with the Committee Chairmen and with the support of
the Company Secretary. The evaluation was conducted by way of a formal questionnaire that enabled Directors’ perspectives on the
effectiveness of the Board and Committees to be fed back to the Chairman and the full Board. Performance evaluations of Board
Committees were conducted on behalf of the Chairman by the Chairmen of the respective Board Committees, The Non Executive
Directors, led by the Senior Independent Director, reviewed the performance of the Chairman and the Executive Directors.

Directors may take independent professional advice in the furtherance of their duties, at the Group's expense. All Directors have access to
the advice and services of the Company Secretary, the appointment and removal of whom is a matter for the Board as a whole.

All Directors, appointed by the Board, are required by the Company's Articles of Association to be elected by the Shareholder at the first
AGM after their appointment. On appointment, the Directors take part in an induction programme where they receive information about
the Royal Mail Group, the role of the Board and matters reserved for its decision, the terms of reference and membership of the principal
Board Committees, the Company's Corporate Governance arrangements and the latest financial information about the Group. This is
supplemented by visits to key business locations. The Company engages in two-way communication with the Shareholder to discuss
information on its strategy, performance and policies, The Board receives feedback on these meetings from the Directors attending the
meeting.

During the year, the Directors attended the following number of meetings of the Board and its main Committees:

Internal control
Overview
The Directors are responsible for the Group's system of internal control and risk management, as well as the timely review of its

effectiveness. The system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only
provide reasonable but not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.

The Group's approach to internal control is based on the underlying principle of line management accountability for control and risk
management. There is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the Group in accordance
with the guidance detailed by the Turnbutl Committee as part of the Code, including financial and operational risks and risks to reputation.
The Board regularly reviews this process. The process has been in place throughout the year and up to the date of approval of these
accounts, The responsibility for joint ventures and associates rests, on the whole, with the senior management of those operations. The
Company monitors its investments and exerts influence through Board representations.

The Board has reviewed the effectiveness of the system of risk management and internal control. The key elements include a review of
Internal Audit reports, regular confirmations from local management and communications from the Chair of the Audit and Risk Committee
‘on the outcome of Audit and Risk Committee meetings.

Audit and Risk Committee
The Committee reports to the Board and meets as a minimum on a quarterly basis to monitor and review the effectiveness of the control
environment. The Committee reviews the scope of work, authority and resaurces of the Internal Audit and Risk Management function.

Corporate Risk Management Committee

This is a sub-committee of the Audit and Risk Committee. It sets the framework for risk management within the Group and ensures
integration with strategic planning. It also facilitates regular reporting of key risks and the actions to manage the risks to a desired level.
The members of this Committee include David Burden (Chair), the Group Treasury Director, the Internal Audit and Risk Management
Director, the Director Corporate and Social Responsibility and other senior executives from across the Group,

Key control processes

The key processes used to assess the effectiveness of systems are ongoing and include the following:

. the business units have authority to manage within the limits set by the Board and within the scope of reserved powers. The
Group's Code of Business Standards sets the principles of professionalism and integrity for our people;

. discussion and approval by the Board of the strategic direction, plans and objectives of the Group and each operating company,
and the risks to achieving them;

. reviews and approval by the Board of budgets and forecasts;

. monthly reviews of performance by reference to key performance indicators, updated forecasts and information on the key risk
areas;

. at least quarterly reviews by the Audit and Risk Committee of the scope and results of internal audit work across the Group. The
scope of the work covers all key activities of the Group and concentrates on higher risk areas;

. reviews of the scope of the work of the external auditors by the Audit and Risk Committee and any significant issues arising;

. reviews by the Audit and Risk Committee of accounting policies and delegated authority levels; and

. consideration by the Audit and Risk Committee of the major risks facing the Group and procedures to manage them.

Risk Management process

There is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the Group. This process has been in
place throughout the year under review, and up to the date of approval of the Annual Report and Accounts, and accords with the Turnbull
guidance. The effectiveness of the process is reviewed annually by the Audit and Risk Committee, which then reports to the Board.

The pracess consists of:

= formal identification by management at each level of the Group through a self assessment process of the key risks to achieving
their business objectives and the controls in place to manage them. The likelihood and potential impact of each risk is evaluated;

= certification by management that they are responsible for managing the risks to their business objectives and that the internal
controls are such that they provide reasonable but not absolute assurance that the risks are appropriately identified, evaluated
and managed:

. quarterly reporting and review by the management of each business unit of risk management activities and action taken to
address non-compliance with controls or to improve their effectiveness; and

. independent assurance by Internal Audit as to the existence and effectiveness of the risk management activities described by
management.

The system of internal control and risk management is embedded into the operations of the Group, and the actions taken to mitigate any
weaknesses are carefully monitored.

Directors’ Remuneration Report

Information not subject to audit

This report provides the information required by the Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 (the Regulations). The Company
confirms that throughout the year it has complied with the principles in Section 1 of the Combined Cade on Corporate Governance (the
Code).

The Royal Mail Group strategic plan commits to extensive transformational change to ensure that its customers are offered high-quality
and cost-effective services. The Board believes that an effective remuneration strategy is essentiat to support the plan by ensuring that
the company has people of the right calibre and skills to meet the considerable challenges the company faces. Incentives which create an
identity of interest between employees and the Shareholder form a vital part of this strategy.

The Remuneration Committee

The Board retains overall accountability for the framework and costs of executive remuneration and the terms of the service contracts
offered to all Executive Directors, which require the consent of the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, The Secretary of State atso
approves the remuneration of Non Executive Directors. The Remuneration Committee's role is to develop the remuneration policy for
Executive Directors and their immediate reports and specifically to make recommendations on their salary, benefits, bonuses and other
terms and conditions of employment. The Committee also recommends appropriate compensation on the cessation of employment, giving
careful consideration to what compensation should be paid taking into account the circumstances of the particular case and ability of the
individual to mitigate.

The Remuneration Committee is made up wholly of independent Non Executive Directors. Membership of the Committee is disclosed on
page 34. The Chief Executive, Adam Crozier, and the Director People & Organisational Development, Tony McCarthy, may attend these
meetings by invitation but are not present at the discussion of their own remuneration.

Advice to the Remuneration Committee
The Committee cails for information and advice from inside and outside the Group. It takes advice from those independent, professional
organisations that are best able to assist its consideration of the particular topics under discussion.

During 2005-06, advice on the performance of key executives was given by the Chairman and the Chief Executive. Information on the
external marketplace was given by Monks Partnership (a trading name of PriceWaterhouse Coopers). Deloitte, and Watson Wyatt Limited.
Internal support is primarily provided by the Director People & Organisational Development, Tony McCarthy, and from the Company
Secretary, Jonathan Evans. Other advice and information has been provided by specialists from People & Organisational Development and
Finance.

During the year, advice was given to the Company by Watson Wyatt Limited on pension and actuarial matters.

Remuneration policy
The Company's paticy on Directors’ remuneration is that:

= the overall remuneration package should be sufficiently competitive to attract and retain executives of the necessary
quality in a complex business and a competitive market place, who will deliver success for the Shareholder and high
tevels of customer service, safety and environmental performance;

* a significant proportion of the remuneration package should be dependent on performance in both the short and the
long-term; and

= the system of remuneration should establish an identity of interest between senior executives, customers and the
Shareholder.

The policy for senior executives takes into account pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group.

The Committee regularly reviews the structure of the package and its competitiveness against appropriate marketplaces. The Committee
aims to ensure that the package is proportionate and effective, and that it is developed in accordance with accepted best practice, During
2005-06, as part of its regular review, the Committee has given particular consideration to annual and long-term incentive
arrangements.

The main components of remuneration

The main components for Executive Directors are: basic salary, an annual performance-related bonus, a Long-Term Incentive Plan,
pension and other benefits. The Committee betieves that there should be a continuing emphasis on those elements of remuneration that
are performance-related.

Directors’ Remuneration Report (continued)

Base salaries

The Committee believes that base salaries should be set at levels that are sufficient to recruit and retain high calibre executives. In making
its judgement, the Committee is informed by a variety of data aimed at making a fair comparison with enterprises of a similar size and
complexity to Royal Mail. This data is provided by independent consultancies. Increases are recommended where the Committee believes
that it is necessary to reflect contribution, increased individual responsibilities and market levels. All increases are approved by the
Secretary of State.

Performance-related, personal annual bonus 2005-06
The Chairman and Executive Directors may earn a performance-related bonus for achievement of financial and customer targets.

In the case of the non-executive Chairman a bonus of up to £180,000 is payable. The level of bonus has not changed since the Chairman
was appointed in March 2002.

The Remuneration Committee concluded that it was in the Shareholder's interest to encourage performance from executive directors
above the level of the budget and accordingly, in line with market practice and with the consent of the Secretary of State, have put in
place bonus arrangements for above target performance.

The percentages of base salary available through the bonus plan are as follows:

Threshold level On-target level Maximum
Chief Executive 30% 60% 100%
Other Executive Directors 24% 48% 80%

The on-target tevel bonus of 60% for the Chief Executive is a reduction from the previous 75% level. For other executive directors, the
on-target level has increased from 40% to 48%,

The measures used are annual operating profit before exceptional iterns and quality of service.
The quality of service measures are as follows:

First Class stamped and metered
Second Class stamped and metered
Mailsort 2
Mailsort 3
Special Delivery
2™ Class PPI
Parcelforce 24
* Post Office Limited new products sotd
Quality Targets are those in the Postcomm licence agreement and a number of these, including First Class stamped and metered, have
heen increased since last year. The first six of these quality measures account for the overwhelming bulk of mail and include the key
products of interest to the general public

The annual operating profit before exceptional items and the basket of quality measures are weighted so that if the on-target or threshold
levels are achieved against all measures they each make up 50% of the bonus. At the maximum level, the weighting moves to 60% on
profit and 40% on quality of service. Each measure in the bonus plan is independent of the others. In the case of the Managing Directors
of the Letters business and of Post Office Limited, 30% of their bonus is related to the profit and quality measures relating to the Group
and 70% to the profit and quality measures of their particular businesses.

Bonuses for intermediate amounts are calculated pro rata.

The Executive Directors are also entitled to a Share in Success payment at the same level as that paid to all other employees.
Long-Term Incentive Plan 2005-06

The Company operates a Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) for the Executive Directors and certain other senior employees. The objectives
of the LTIP are to incentivise the delivery of the fong-term business goals of the Group and to reward success in achieving or exceeding
these goals.

The Remuneration Committee has extensively consulted the Government on the most appropriate form of this incentive, but while the
discussions with Government on the strategic plan continue, the LTIP has not yet been finalised.

The discussions with Government have taken the previous LTIP as a model. The previous LTIP had the following key features:

© Annual Company Performance Awards which accrued on a sliding scale above a threshold tevel of performance and begin at
12.5% of annual base salary. For on-target performance, the Company Award was 25% of annual base salary and for
exceptional performance this rose in accordance with a stepped scale to a maximum of 37.5%:

amount of annual bonus waived by the employee. An emptoyee had the discretion to waive a maximum of one half of any
annual bonus up to the on-target level. In the new plan, if a bonus above on-target would otherwise be payable, then three
quarters of this additional amount will be compulsorily waived: and

* — Afinat enhancement. At the end of the performance period the amounts which had been set aside as both Annual Company
Performance Awards and as Bonus Awards could be further increased depending on a further performance factor. If the on-
target level was achieved then an additional one third was added. In the case of exceptional performance then up to a
maximum addition of 100% coutd be added.

Other than the requirement that three quarters of any annual bonus earned above the on-target level must be waived and an award of
equivalent value be made in the LTIP, it is envisaged that the potential rewards that can be earned under the plan will be broadly similar
to the previous arrangement.

The Company has made an estimate in its accounts for a Company Award for 2005-06 due under the new LTIP and is making an
appropriate recomnmendation to the Secretary of State. This award will not exceed 37.5% of the participants’ base salary,

Benefits
Benefits include the provision of company cars, health insurance, or the cash equivalent of any benefits not taken

Pensions

The Group has a liability to pay pensions in respect of Directors’ services and for some Executive Directors makes contributions to pension
schemes for this purpose. The Company has set up a retirement pension arrangement, which will provide benefits to Directors whose
contributions to the Company scheme are restricted by the Inland Revenue earings cap. Following the recent changes in pensions
legislation the Company will continue to apply the previous earnings cap, indexed by inflation each year, as a constraint on the amount of
salary which is pensionable through the Company scheme.

Fixed and performance-related elements of Executive Directors’ remuneration (excluding pensions)

For 2004-05, 42.5% of Directors’ potential annual earnings related to fixed elements, whist 57.5% related to annualised performance
elements, For the CEO 37% was fixed and 63% was variable. The current Long-Term Incentive Plan is still under discussion but is
expected to be broadly similar in terms of potential payments as the current plan. The annual bonus plan was changed in 2005-06 to
include a stretch element for performance above target and the percentage of total remuneration at risk to performance is therefore
higher than in the previous year.

Service contracts

The Committee's policy is that Executive Directors appointed to the Board are offered notice periods of one year. The Committee has a
defined policy on compensation and mitigation, to be applied in the event of a Director's contract being prematurely terminated. In such
circumstances, steps would be taken to ensure that poor performance is not rewarded.

The rolling service contracts and jetters of appointment of the Directors include the following terms:

Pensions

The Group normally offers its most senior people membership of the Royal Mail Senior Executive Pension Plan (RMSEPP). Details of the
RMSEPP are set out in note 14 to the accounts. The Plan is a funded, Inland Revenue-approved final salary occupational pension scheme.
The scheme provides for a two-thirds final pensionable salary at a normal retirement age of 60, subject to the necessary pensionable
service and Inland Revenue earnings cap. Pensions in payment are increased annually in line with Retail Prices Index (RPI), subject in
some cases to a cap. Pensions are also payable to dependants on the death of the member and a lump sum is payable if death in service
occurs.

For senior executives whose membership of the RMSEPP is restricted by the earnings cap, pension provision is made by a combination of
the Company scheme and an appropriate Funded Unapproved Retirement Benefits Scheme (FURBS) or equivalent. lan Griffiths receives a
cash supplement of 40% of base pay above the earnings cap. Alan Cook is not a member of the Company scheme and receives a cash
supplement of 40% of base pay less the equivalent member pension contributions payable under the Company scheme. The Company has
made provision for retirement pension arrangements at a rate of 40% of base pay above the earnings cap for Adam Crozier and David
Burden. A reserve has been established for the additional pension for Tony McCarthy to pravide the total retirement pension, including the
pension from his previous employer's pension scheme, of two-thirds of base pay at normal retirement age. The total provision for Adam
Crozier, Tony McCarthy and David Burden at the year end is £1,421,447 (2005 £674,379). Marisa Cassoni's reserve amounted to
£535,193 at the end of March 2005.

Disclosure of Directors’ pension transfer values is required under two separate requirements:

= Stock Exchange Listings Rules: the requirements are the same as disclosed in last year's accounts and are designed to
indicate the increase in the value of Directors’ accrued benefits during the period. The transfer value is calculated on the
basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11 and excludes Directors’ contributions; and

« Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002: this is designed to assess the change in transfer values during the
year, taking into account movement in investment market conditions. Falls in market values may generate a negative
movement in the transfer values.

The transfer values disclosed represent a potential liability of the pension plan rather than any remuneration due to the individual and
cannot be meaningfully aggregated with annual remuneration, as it is not money the individual is entitled to receive,

Independent Auditor's Report to the members of Royal Mail Holdings plc

We have audited the Group financial statements of Royal Mail Holdings plc for the year ended 26 March 2006 which comprise the Group
income statement, the Group balance sheet, the Group cash flow statement, the Group statement of recognised income and expense and
the related notes 1 to 31. These Group financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein,

We have reported separately on the parent company financial statements of Royal Mail Holdings plc for the year ended 26 March 2006
and on the information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited.

This report is made solely to the Company's members, as a body, in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company's members those matters we are required to state to them in an
auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone
other than the Company and the Company's members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors

The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Group financial statements in accordance with applicable United
Kingdom law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union as set out in the Statement of
Directors’ Responsibilities.

Our responsibility is to audit the Group financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).

We report to you our opinion as to whether the Group financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the Group financial
statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We also report
to you if, in our opinion, the Directors’ Report is not consistent with the Group financial statements, if we have not received all the
information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding director's remuneration and other
transactions is not disclosed.

We review whether the Corporate Governance statement reflects the Company's compliance with the nine provisions of the 2003 FRC
Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not
required to consider whether the Board's statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Group's Corporate Governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.

We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited Group financial
statements. The other information comprises only the Chairman's Statement, the Chief Executive's Statement, the Annual Review, the
Operating and Financial Review, the Directors’ Report, the Corporate Governance statement, the Internal Control statement, the unaudited
part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the Statement of Directors’ responsibilities. We consider the implications for our report if
we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the Group financial statements. Our responsibilities do
not extend to any other information.

Basis of audit opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board.
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the Group financial statements. It
also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgments made by the directors in the preparation of the Group financial
statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group's circumstances, consistently applied and adequately
disclosed.

We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to
provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the Group financial statements are free from material misstatement,
whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation
of information in the Group financial statements.

Opinion

In our opinion the Group financial statements:

© give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, of the state of the Group's affairs as at 26
March 2006 and of its profit for the year then ended; and

@ have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.

Notes to the Group accounts

‘1. Authorisation of financial statements and statement of compliance with IFRSs.

‘The Group's financial statements for the year ended 26 March 2006 were authorised for issue by the Board on 17 May 2006 and the balance sheet.
was signed on the Board's behalf by Allan Leighton and Adam Crozier. Rayal Mail Holdings plc is a public limited company owned by HM Government.

The Group's financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the
European Union as they apply to the financial statements of the Group for the year ended 26 March 2006. The principal accounting policies adopted by
the Group are set out in note 2.

2. Accounting policies
‘The adoption of IFRS has resulted in changes to the Group's accounting policies. The amended accounting policies are:

Basis of preparation and accounting

This is the first year in which the Group has prepared its financial statements under IFRSs and the comparatives have been restated from UK Generally
Accepted Accounting Practice (UK GAAP) to comply with IFRSs. The Group issued its preliminary IFRSs financial statements for 2005 and the
reconciliations to IFRSs from the previously published UK GAAP financial statements in November 2005, and these are published on the Royal Mail
website and in note 31.

The Group financial statements are presented in sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest million pounds except when otherwise indicated.

Royal Mail Group plc is exposed to the risk of being fined by its industry Regulator and of being required to pay compensation to certain customers, as a
result of failing to meet operational targets set by the Regulator in the Company's licence. The amount of such fines and compensation will be
determined by the Regulator after further representations from the Company and no further information is being disclosed on the grounds that it can
be expected to prejudice the outcome of that process.

Funding

Royal Mail Group ple

Royal Mail Group plc has net liabilities at 26 March 2006, primarily because of the pension deficit within its main pension plan, the Royal Mail Pension
Plan. Consequently, Royal Mail Group pic is in default of its borrowing facilities with Government, but has received formal waivers from the Department
of Trade and Industry, in its capacity as tender.

Royal Mail Group plc is profitable, even though it has to bear losses relating to stamped mail and carry out its Universal Service Obligations, but it now
faces considerable cash requirements with respect to its proposed investment in plant and equipment and funding its pension deficit at a time when the
market has been opened up to full competition.

Itis therefore currently in discussion with its Shareholder around a new funding package, which will enable the transformation of the Company to take
place and permit appropriate discussion with its pension Trustee with respect to the funding of its pension deficit. The Directors of Royai Mail Group ple
believe that the financing package will be delivered shortly. If new financing is not made available, the Directors will have to review the cash
requirements of its strategic plan that will result in a delay to the planned benefits. On the basis of careful consideration of cash flow projections the
Directors have concluded that it is appropriate that the accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis.

Post Office Limited
Post Office Limited had net liabifities as at 26th March 2006 and, as explained in the Directors’ Report and Operating Financial Review, continues to
‘operate at a loss, primarily because of supporting the loss-making rural network.

To become viable in the longer term, new profitable business areas are being developed to replace the lost contribution from traditional income sources,
significant cost reduction pragrammes are being implemented and continuing support for any loss-making rural network required by Government policy
is being sought from Government.

However, until the above activities have been successfully completed, Post Office Limited will continue to be dependent on financial support from its
parent company, Royal Mail Group plc, its ultimate parent company Royal Mail Holdings plc, and from the Government.

During the year, the Post Office Limited has produced a five-year strategic plan and its future financing is underpinned by:

two tranches of rural network funding of £150m per annum for 2006-07 and 2007-08 for which state aid clearance has now been obtained;
 —_anexisting short-term funding agreement of £145m with its parent through to March 2007;

© anew additional short-term funding agreement of £2311m with its parent through to March 2008;

© anunderstanding that Government will agree a long-term funding arrangement; and

 — Government being committed to a timetable, route map and consultation processes and, for any additional financing, that the necessary state aid
applications will be commenced as soon as practical.

Jt is understood that the above process will specifically address the following financing issues:
© extending the existing working capital facility of £1.15bn which expires in March 2010; and
* providing a funding solution for the loss-making parts of the network.

‘Whilst the process referred to above is not expected to be completed for several months, after careful consideration, the Directors are confident that a
satisfactory long-term resolution will be achieved during 2006-07 and that the Group will be able to meet future liabilities as they fail due.

Accordingly, on that basis, the Directors consider that it is appropriate that the accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis.

2. Accounting policies (continued)
Basis of consolidation

The consolidated financial statements comprise the accounts of Royal Mail Holdings plc and its subsidiary undertakings, The financial statements of the
major subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent Company, using consistent accounting policies.

All intragroup balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from intragroup transactions, have been eliminated in full. Transfer prices
between business segments are set on a basis of charges reached through a negotiation with the respective businesses.

Subsidiaries are consolidated frorn the date on which control is obtained by the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which control is no.
longer held by the Group. Where there is a loss of control of a subsidiary, the consolidated financial statements include the results for the part of the
reporting year during which the Group has control.

Investments in associates and joint ventures

The Group's investments in its associates and joint ventures are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method, the
investment is carried in the balance sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Group's share of the net assets of the associate/jaint venture, less
any impairment in value. The income statement reflects the Group's share of post tax profits of the assaciate/joint venture,

Any goodwill arising on acquisition of an associate, representing the excess of the cost of the investment compared to the Group's share of the net fair
value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired, is included in the carrying amount and not amortised. To the extent that the
net fair value of the associate's identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is greater than the cost of the investment, a gain is recognised and
added to the Group's share of the associate's profit or loss in the period in which the investment is acquired.

Revenue

Mails revenue

Account revenue is derived from specific contracts and recognised when the mail delivery is substantially complete. Prepaid revenue mainly relating to
stamp and meter income is recognised when the sale is made, adjusted to reflect a value of stamp and meter credits held but not used by the customer.

Parcelforce Worldwide revenue
Account revenue is derived from specific contracts and recognised when the delivery of an item is substantially complete,

Post Office Limited revenue
Revenue is recognised when retail and financial services are provided.

General Logistics Systems
Revenue is derived fram specific contracts and is recognised at the time of delivery.

Distribution and conveyance

Distribution and conveyance costs relate to third party costs incurred in carrying mail. These include conveyance by rail, road, sea and air, together with
costs incurred by international rail carriers and Parcelforce Worldwide delivery operators, These costs are disclosed separately on the face of the
income statement.

Operating profit before exceptional items.

Operating profit is the profit arising from the normal, recurring operations of the business. This incorporates revenue, people costs, operating costs
including distribution and conveyance, and the Group's post tax share of profits from associates and joint ventures. Operating exceptional items are
separately identified.

Operating exceptional items

Operating exceptional items are material items of income and expenditure which due to the nature of the events giving rise to them, require separate
presentation on the face of the income statement or in a note to allow a better understanding of financial performance in the year, in comparison to
prior years,

Operating profit

Operating prafit is the profit arising from the normal, recurring operations of the business and after charging operating exceptional items defined above.
it excludes the non operating items for profit or loss cn disposal of businesses and profit or loss on disposal of surplus property, plant and equipment.
These items are not part of the normal recurring operations of the business but are material, so are presented separately on the face of the income
statement to allow a better understanding of financial performance in the year, in comparison to prior years.

Goodwill

Business combinations on or after 29 March 2004 are accounted for under IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ using the purchase method. Any excess of
the cost of the business combination over the Group's interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is
recognised in the balance sheet as goodwill and is not amcrtised.

After initial recognition, goodwill is stated at cost less any accurnulated impairment losses. Goodwill arising from business combinations is reviewed for
impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may he impaired. An impairment loss is
recognised in the income statement for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset (or cash generating unit) exceeds its recoverable amount,
which is the higher of an asset's net reatisable value and its value in use.

For the purpose of these impairment reviews, goodwill is allocated to the related cash generating units as monitored by management.

Goodwill arising on the acquisition of equity accounted entities is included in the cost of those entities and therefore not reported in the balance sheet as
goodwill.

2. Accounting policies (continued)

Intangible assets

Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination are capitalised separately from goodwill if the fair value can be measured reliably on initial
recognition, Intangible assets acquired separately or generated internally are initially recognised at cost and are assessed to have either a finite or
indefinite useful life. Those with a finite life are amortised over their useful life and those with an indefinite life are reviewed annually or more frequently
if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement for
the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of an asset's net realisable value and its value
in use.

Finite lives of intangible assets are in the range of 1-6 years. Amortisation of intangible assets with finite lives is taken annually to the income
statement.

Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is recognised at cost, including attributable costs in bringing the asset into working condition for its intended use.
Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is provided on a straight-line basis by reference to original cost and to the remaining useful econemic
lives of assets and their estimated residual values. The useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually and adjustments, where applicable, are
made on a prospective basis. The lives assigned to major categories of property, plant and equipment and remaining lives are:

‘Average Range of asset lives

remaining lives

Land and buildings:

Freehold land Not depreciated Not depreciated
Freehold buildings 14 years Up to 50 years
Leasehold land and buildings 9 years The shorter of the period of the lease, 50 years or the estimated remaining useful life
Plant and machinery 5 years 3-15 years
Motor vehicles and trailers 3 years 1-12 years
_Fixtures and equipment 2 years 2-15 years

Property that the Group has identified as surplus is classified as ‘available for sale’. When authority to market property categorised in this manner has
been approved and the property is vacant and therefore available for immediate occupation, the property is transferred in line with IFRS 5 into ‘Non-
current assets held for sale’, a separate category on the balance sheet. Such properties are expected primarily to generate economic cash flow by sale of
the asset rather than by operational activities.

Leases

Finance leases, where substantially ail the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the leased item have passed to the Group are capitalised at the
inception of the lease with a corresponding liability recognised for the fair value of the leased item or, if lower. at the present value of the minimum.
lease payments, Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of
interest on the remaining balance of the liability.

Capitatised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset and the lease term.

Leases where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset are retained by the lessor, are classified as operating leases and rentals
are charged to the income statement over the lease term. The aggregate benefit of incentives are recognised as a reduction of rental expenses over the
lease term on a straight-line basis.

Inventories
inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value after adjusting for obsolete or slow moving stock. In the case of Post Office®
Counter Services, inventories include retail stocks and lottery products,

‘Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables are recognised and carried at original invoice ammount less an allowance for any non-collectable amounts. An estimate for doubtful
debts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable. Bad debts are written off when identified.

Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity date of three
months or less. In addition the Group use Money Market funds as a readily available source of cash, which are bought and sold on a daily basis to meet
the cash requirements of the business. These funds are also categorised as cash equivalents.

For the purpose of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of bank overdrafts.

2. Accounting policies (continued)

Financial assets - investments

Financial assets within the scope of IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement are classified as; financial assets at fair value through
income statement; loans, and receivables: held to maturity investments; or as available for sale financial assets, as appropriate. The Group determines
the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition and re-evaluates this designation at each financial year end. When financial assets are
recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, being the transaction price plus, in the case of financial assets not at ‘fair value through the income
statement, any directly attributable transactional costs. The Group has followed the transitional provisions of IFRS 1 ‘First time Adoption of IFRS’ to
adopt IAS 32 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation’ and IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’ from 28 March
2005, the first day of the 2005-06 financial year, and not restate comparative amounts on first applying IAS 32 and IAS 39. The comparative
disclosures therefore reflect the requirements of FRS 13 ‘Derivatives and other Financial Instruments: Disclosures’.

‘The subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on their classification as follows:

Financial assets at fair value through the income statement (held for trading)

Financial assets are classified as held for trading if they are acquired for sale in the short term. Derivatives are also classified as held for trading unless
they are designated as hedging instruments. Assets are carried in the balance sheet at fair value with gains or losses on ‘financial assets at fair value
through the income statement" recognised in the income statement.

Held-to-matunity investments

Non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturity are classified as ‘held to maturity’ when the Group has the
positive intention and ability to hold to maturity. Held to maturity investments are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the investments are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation
process. investments intended to be held for an undefined period are not included in this classification, Prior to 28 March 2005, the Group held such
investments at historic cost less any provision for impairment, except Government gilt-edged securities, which were stated at market value and will now
be categorised as ‘held for trading’.

Loans and receivables

Non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market, do not qualify as trading assets and have
not been designated as either ‘air value through the income statement’ or available for sale, Such assets are carried at amortised cost using the
effective interest rate method if the time value of money is significant, Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the loans and
receivables are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.

Available for sale financial assets

‘Available for sale financial assets’ are non-derivative financial assets that are designated as such or are nat classified in any of the three preceding
categories. After initial recognition, available for sale financial assets are measured at fair value with gains or losses being recognised as a separate
component of equity until the investment is derecognised, or unt the investment is deemed to be impaired at which time the cumulative gain or (oss
previously reported in equity is included in the income statement.

‘The fair value of quoted investments is determined by reference to bid prices at the close of business on the balance sheet date. Where there is no
active market, fair value is determined using valuation techniques. These include using recent arm's length market transactions: reference to the current
market value of another instrument which is substantially the same: and discounted cash flow analysis and pricing models, Otherwise assets will be
carried at cost.

Income tax and deferred tax
The charge for current taxation is based on the results for the year as adjusted for items that are non-assessable or disallowed. It is calculated using
rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.

Deferred tax is provided, using the liability method, on all temporary differences at the balance sheet date, between the tax bases of assets and liabilities
and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.

Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences except:

. initial recognition of goodwilt

= the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction affects neither
the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and

= taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interest in joint ventures, where the timing of the
reversal of the temporary differences can be controiled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable
future.

Other than stated below, deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry-forward of unused tax assets and unused tax
losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, carry-forward of unused
tax assets, and unused tax losses can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are not recognised in respect of:

. deductible temporary differences arising from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination
and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor the taxable profit or loss; and

. deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, except to the extent that
it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the
temporary difference will be utilised.

54

POL00362143
POL00362143

Royal Mail Holdings plc

2. Accounting policies (continued)

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and increased or reduced to the extent that sufficient taxable profit
will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised,

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the tax asset is realised or the liability is
settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax balances are not
discounted.

Deferred tax is charged or credited directly to equity if it relates to items that are credited or charged to equity. Otherwise it is recognised in the income
statement.

Supplier payment policy

The policy of the Company and its principal operating subsidiaries is to use their purchasing power fairly. Payment terms are agreed in advance for all
major contracts. For lower value transactions, the standard payment terms of the supptier apply. itis the Company's policy to abide with the agreed
terms. The Company and its principal operating subsidiaries in the UK have sought to comply with the DTI’s Better Payment Practice Code. Copies of
this can be obtained from the DTI. As the Company is a non-operating company, the creditor days are zero. The creditor days of the operating
subsidiaries can be found in their accounts.

Provisions

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of
resources will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. If the effect of the time value of
money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments
of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability,

Pensions and other post-retirement benefits

Membership of occupational pension schemes is open to most permanent UK employees of the Group. All members of defined benefit schemes are
contracted out of the earnings-related part of the State pension scheme, Overseas subsidiaries make separate arrangements for the provision of
pensions and other post-retirement benefits.

The plans’ assets of the defined benefit schemes are measured at fair value. Liabilities are measured on an actuarial basis using the projected unit credit
method and discounted at a rate equivalent to the current rate of return on a high quality corporate bond of equivalent currency and term. Full
actuarial valuations are carried out at intervals not normally exceeding three years as determined by the Trustees and are updated at each balance
sheet date. The resulting defined benefit asset or liability is presented separately on the face of the balance sheet.

For defined benefit schemes, the amounts charged to operating profit and included as part of people costs are the current service costs and any gains
and losses due on settlements and curtailments. Past service costs are charged to operating profit immediately if benefits have vested. If the benefits
have not vested immediately, the costs are recognised by equal annual instalments over the period until vesting occurs. The net difference between the
interest costs and the expected return on plan assets is recognised as finance costs or finance income respectively. Actuarial gains and losses are
recognised immediately in the statement of recognised income and expense (SORIE). Any deferred tax movement associated with the actuarial gains,
and losses is also recognised in the SORIE.

For defined contribution schemes, the Group's contributions are charged to operating profit as part of people costs in the period to which the
contributions relate.

Research and development
Expenditure on research is written off in the year it is incurred. Development costs are capitalised where they meet the criteria required under IFRS. If
these criteria are not met, then the costs are recognised in the income statement as they are incurred.

Foreign currencies
‘The functional and presentational currency of Royal Mail Holdings pic is sterling (E). The functional currency of the overseas subsidiaries in Europe is
mainly the euro (€).

The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. The trading results of foreign
operations are translated at the average rates of exchange for the reporting periad, being a reasonable approximation to the actual transaction rate.
The exchange differences arising on the translation, since the date of transition to IFRS, are taken directly to the foreign currency translation reserve in
equity.

Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency by applying the spot exchange rate ruling at the date of the
transaction, Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the functional currency rate of exchange ruling at the
balance sheet date, All differences are taken to the income statement, except when hedge accounting is applied and for differences on monetary assets
and liabilities that form part of the Group's net investment in a foreign operation. These are taken directly to equity until the disposal of the net
investment, at which time they are recognised in profit or loss.

Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are transtated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the
initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair vatue in foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair
vatue is determined.

Derivative financial instruments
The Group uses derivative instruments such as foreign currency contracts in order to manage the risk profile of any underlying risk exposure of the
Group, in tine with the Group’s treasury management policies. Such derivative financial instruments are initially stated at fair value.

For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as cash flow hedges where they hedge exposure to variability in cash flows that is either
attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a forecasted transaction.

In relation to cash flow hedges to hedge the foreign exchange risk of firm commitments that meet the conditions for hedge accounting, the portion of
the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly in equity and the ineffective portion is
Tecognised in the income statement.

55

POL00362143
POL00362143

Royal Mail Holdings plc

2. Accounting policies (continued)

When the hedged firm commitment results in the recognition of a non financial asset or non financial liability, then, at the time the asset or liability is
recognised, the associated gains or losses that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the acquisition cost
or other carrying amount of the asset or liablty. For all other cash flow hedges, the gains or losses that are recognised in equity are transferred to the
income statement in the same year in which the hedged firm commitment affects the net profitloss, for example when the future sale actually occurs.

For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are taken directly to the income
statement in the period.

Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is kept in equity until the forecast transaction occurs. If
a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement for the
year.

In accordance with the exemption under IFRS 1, comparative information has been prepared under previous UK GAAP (FRS13) and not IAS 32 and IAS
39. As a consequence derivative assets and liabilities were not included in the balance sheet at 27 March 2005. The comparative information in the
financial statements is presented in line with the accounting policy followed under UK GAAP as follows.

‘The Group uses forward foreign currency contracts to reduce exposure to foreign exchange rates. The Group's policy is that its derivative instruments
qualify for hedge accounting when the following criteria are met:

- the instrument must be related to a foreign currency asset or liability that is probable and whose characteristics have been identified:
- it must involve the same currency as the hedged item; and
= it must reduce the risk of foreign currency movements on the Group's operations,

‘The contracted rates are used to record the hedged item. As a result, gains and losses are offset against the foreign exchange gains or losses on the
related financial assets and liabilities. Where the instrument is used to hedge a committed or probable future transaction, gains or losses are not
recognised until the transaction occurs.

In addition, over-the-counter derivative products are used to manage both the commodity and foreign exchange risks associated with the fuel
procurement policy. Further details on financial instruments can be found in note 29 to the accounts.

interest-bearing loans and borrowings
All {oans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received, less directly attributable issue costs.

After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the liabilities are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.

‘Segmental information

The Group discloses segmental results as required by IAS 14 ‘Segment Information’. The Group's primary reporting format is by business segments and
its secondary format is by geographical segments. The operating segments are organised and managed separately according to the nature of the
products and services provided, with each segment representing a strategic business unit that offers different products and serves largely different
markets.

Royal Mail is the Group’s letters business and delivers letters to all addresses in the United Kingdom. Royal Mail offers a number of products to both
business and domestic users.

Parcelforce Worldwide is the parcels business unit operating within the UK.

Post Office Limited is a limited company responsible for the High Street’ Post Office® ‘counters’ branches offering a series of retail services to its
customers.

Generat Logistics Systems is the European parcels business, which via its subsidiaries and partners offers its services in 34 European countries.

Transfer prices between business segments are set on a basis of charges reached through negotiation with the respective businesses.

The Group has unrecognised deferred tax assets of £1,380m (2005 £970m) relating to the retirement benefit obligation, £224m (2005
£245m) relating mainly to fixed asset timing differences, and £113m (2005 £108m) relating to tax losses in subsidiaries that are available to
offset against future taxable profits. The Group has capital losses carried forward, the tax effect of which is £12m (2005 £11m). The Group has
rolled over capital gains of £83m (2005 £78m); no tax liability would be expected to crystallise should the assets into which the gains have
been rolled be sold at their carrying value, as it is anticipated that a capital loss would arise.

At 26 March 2006, there was no recognised or unrecognised deferred income tax liability (2005 £nil) for taxes that would be payable on the
unremitted earnings of certain of the Group's subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures as the Group has no liability to additional taxation should
such amounts be remitted due to the availability of double taxation relief or other exemptions.

The carrying value of goodwill arising on business combinations of £132m (2005 £131m) at the balance sheet date, includes £131m (2005,
£130m) relating to the General Logistics Systems (‘GLS’) business segment. In line with the accounting policy (see note 2), this goodwill has
been reviewed for impairment. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the carrying value of an asset or cash generating
unit exceeds the recoverable amount, The recoverable amount is the higher of net realisable value and vatue in use. The carrying value of GLS,
excluding interest bearing and tax related assets and liabilities, is £283m at year end (see note 3) and the operating profit before exceptional
items is £100m for the year (see note 3). The carrying value represents a multiple of 2.8 on operating profit before exceptional items. The net
realisable value of GLS, for the purposes of the impairment review (i. the ‘fair value less costs to sell’), has been assessed with reference to
earnings multiples for quoted entities in a similar sector. On this basis, the net realisable value of GLS has been assessed to be in excess of the
carrying value, No reasonable possible change in the earnings multiplies referenced would reduce the net realisable value to below the carrying
value.

From 29 March 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, goodwill is no longer amortised but subject to annual impairment reviews.

Freehold and leasehold properties that are being actively marketed and are fully vacant (indicating that a sale is highly probable and the
property is available for immediate sale), are classified as ‘non current assets held for sale’ on the basis that their primary recovery is through
sale and not occupancy. The expected disposal of these properties is as a result of the Group continuing to rationalise its portfolio and exit
surplus properties, These properties are expected to be disposed of within one year.

During the year, a gain of £20m (2005 Enil) was recognised in the income statement in relation to the disposal of such property.

Any impairment is as a result of reassessing the carrying values of properties after they have been reclassified to ‘non-current assets held for
sale’. During the year, an impairment of £3m was recognised as an operating exceptional item (note 6).

Properties held as ‘non-current assets held for sale’ have been allocated to Royal Mail, Post Office Limited and Parcelforce Worldwide for
segmental reporting purposes.

‘14. Employee benefits - pensions

The Group operates pension schemes as detailed below.

Name Eligibility Type

Royal Mail Pension Plan (RMPP) UK employees Defined benefit

Royal Mail Senior Executive Pension Plan (RMSEPP) UK senior executives Defined benefit

Royal Mail Retirement Savings Plan (RMRSP) UK employees Defined contribution
Overseas subsidiary

Various ather small-scale schemes operated by overseas subsidiaries _ employees Defined contribution

Defined Contribution

A charge for the defined contribution schemes of £2m (2005 £m) was recognised in operating profit before exceptional items within the
income statement. The Company contributions to these schemes was £1m (2005 £1m).

Defined Benefit

Both RMPP and RMSEPP are funded by the payment of contributions to separate trustee administered funds. The ‘atest full actuarial
valuations of both schemes were carried out as at 31 March 2003 using the projected unit method. The next full valuations are due to be
carried out as at 31 March 2006.

The regular future service contributions for RMPP. expressed as a percentage of pensionable pay, are expected to increase from 12.6% to 20%.
For RMSEPP, contributions are at 20.9% and future rates will be discussed with the Trustee during the 2006 actuarial valuation. Payment of
£113m (2005 £138m) was made during the year to fund the deficit in the schemes. It is anticipated that further such payments will be made
in future as required. A current liability of £47m (2005 £208m) has been recognised for payments to the pension schemes relating to
redundancy. During the year, payments of £209 (2005 £5m) relating to redundancy were made.

The foltowing disclosures relate to the RMPP and RMSEPP defined benefit scheme plans:

a) Major assumptions

The size of the pension deficit, which is large in the context of the Group and its finances, is materially sensitive to the assumptions
adopted. Small changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the deficit and overall income statement charge. The
rnajor assumptions were:

At 26 March 2006 At 27 March 2005,
Spa &pa
Rate of increase in salaries 38 42
Pate of increase in pensions and deferred pensions 28 27
Discount rate 49 55
Inflation assumption 28 27
Expected average rate of return on assets 7a IZ)

Mortality

Gver recent months the Group and the RMPP Trustee have discussed potential changes to the mortality assumptions to be adopted for the 2006
actuarial valuation. These discussions have been based on an analysis carried out by the Trustee of the experience of the plan’s pensioner
population up to 31 March 2005, The Trustee has proposed a particular mortality basis - based on the 1992 series mortality tables allowing for
“medium cohort’ projections of future improvements - and this has been applied to RMPP at the current year end. For consistency, the same
improvement has been assumed for RMSEPP. This differs from the prior year, when assumptions consistent with the latest full actuarial
valuations were used. The table below illustrates how these assumptions have changed.

_ Average expected life expectancy from age 60: 2006 2005
For a current 60 year old male RMPP member 26 years 22 years
For a current 60 year old female RMPP member 29 years 25 years

recognised in transition to IFRSs is attributable to actuarial gains and losses since inception of the pension schemes. Consequently, the
Directors are unable to determine the cumulative amount of actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognised in the statement of

recognised income and expense since inception of the pension schemes, before transition to IFRSs.

Under IAS 19 ‘Employee benefits’ businesses are required to recognise for ail short-term accumulating compensated absences such as holiday
entitlement earned but not taken at the balance sheet date. The business’ holiday entitlement coincides with the financial year. Employees are
allowed to carry forward untaken leave outstanding at the year end if this is approved by the business. The impact of these provisions within
IAS 19 on the Group's financial statements is to recognise an annual leave accrual in the balance sheet at 26 March 2006 of £39m (2005

The cash utilisation af £99m includes £96m of spend relating to exceptional rationalisation and £3m relating to other operating costs. Total
cash spend in the year relating to exceptional rationalisation is shown in the cash flow statement. Included within provisions is £51m (2005
£67m) relating to onerous property contracts and £13m (2005 £13m) of decommissioning costs.

The Mails and Parcels provision includes amounts relating to redundancy and ather non-redundancy items (onerous property contracts and
decommissioning costs), which relate to restructuring programmes. During the year £60m (2005 £36m) was charged to exceptional items
and £11m (2005 £11m) to other operating costs. £39m was transferred to creditors due within one year mainly relating to amounts due to
the pension scheme for redundancies with early retirement. £58m of this provision is expected to be utilised in 2006-07 and the remainder
over the following two to three years, except far £12m relating to decommissioning costs and £341m relating to onerous property contracts,
which are expected to be utilised over a longer periad. The timing of cash flows for these provisions are by their nature uncertain and
dependent upon the outcome of related events, The best estimates of the amounts are shown in the table above.

Counter Services provisions include amounts relating to the continuing headcount reduction programme. During the year £15m was
charged to exceptional items and £9m was transferred to creditors due within one year mainly relating to amounts due to the pension
scheme for redundancies with early retirement. The balance is expected to be utilised in 2006-07.

The change in the carrying vatue of the discounted element of the provision due to the passage of time is not material.

28. Financial risk management objectives and policies

The Group's principal financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise short-term deposits, money market liquidity investments,
Government gilt edged securities, loans, finance leases and hire purchase contracts and cash. The main purpases of these financial instruments
are to raise finance and manage the liquidity needs of the business operations. The Group has various other financial instruments such as
trade debtors and trade creditors, which arise directly from operations.

The Group also enters into derivative transactions, principally commodity swaps and forward currency contracts. The purpose is to manage the
commodity and currency risks arising from the Group's operations.

It is, and has been throughout the year under review, the Group's policy that no speculative trading in financial instruments shall be
undertaken.

The main risks arising from the Group's financial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk, foreign currency risk, commodity price and
credit risk. The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.

Interest rate risk

‘The Group's exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to the Group's debt obligations and interest bearing financial assets
The DTI loans to Royat Mail Group plc (£500m as at March 2006) are at a fixed interest rate to maturity (average date 2023). The HM
Treasury loans to Post Office Limited (£360m as at March 2006) are at short-dated fixed interest rates (average maturity 4 days as at March
2006). The total interest bearing financial assets of the group (£1,060m as at March 2006) are at short-dated fixed interest rates (average
maturity 50 days as at March 2006). Both of these short-dated financial instruments are maturity managed to obtain the best value out of the
interest yield curve.

The Group's policy is to manage its net interest expense using an appropriate mix of fixed and variable rate financial instruments, No externat
hedging of interest rate risk is undertaken.

POL00362143
POL00362143

Royal Mail Holdings plc

28. Financiat risk management objectives and policies (continued)

Foreign currency risk

The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk due to trading with overseas postal operators for carrying UK mail abroad and delivering foreign
origin mail in the UK, and the balances held to operate the Bureau de Change services within Post Office Limited. These risks are mitigated by
hedging programmes managed by Group Treasury. Where possible, exposures are netted intemnatly and any remaining exposure is hedged
using a combination of external spot and forward contracts. All other significant exposures are considered individually; hedging will not
normally be considered for exposures of less than £1m; hedging is normally confined to 80% of the forecast exposure where forecast cash
flows are highly probable.

The Group's obligation to settle with overseas postal operators is denominated in Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) - a basket currency comprising
of US Dollar (USD), Japanese Yen (JPY), Sterling and euro. The Group has a policy of matching receipts and payments for individual currencies
where possible and then hedging any material net exposure. The policy is that up to 80% of the forecast net exposure is hedged with
agreement of the internal business unit. Group Treasury operates a rolling 18-month programme, which is subsequently reviewed on a
quarterly basis, There has been no external hedge in place throughout the financial year 2005-06 due to there being no material net
exposure.

Balances of major currency holdings along with minor currencies showing a closely correlated movement for the Bureau de Change business
are hedged.

The Group's obligations to settle USD invoices on a specific capital project were hedged. This programme matured during the year.

Two further hedge programmes have been initiated during the year. The Group's obligations to settle conveyance charges in USD and euro has
been hedged (as far forward as March 2007). Additionally the Group's obligation to settle euro invoices on a smail capital project has been
hedged.

The Group does not hedge the translation exposure created by the net assets of its overseas subsidiaries.

Commodity price risk

The Group is exposed to fuel price risk arising from operating one of the largest vehicle fleets in Europe, which consumes over 150 million
litres of fuet per year, and a jet fuel price risk arising from the purchasing of air freight services, The Group's fuel risk management strategy
aims to reduce uncertainty created by the movements in the oil and foreign currency markets. The strategy operates within the parameters set
by the Board, which allow the use of over-the-counter derivative products (in both USD commodity price and USD/Sterling exchange rate) to
manage these exposures.

In addition, the Group is exposed to the commodity price risk of purchasing electricity and gas. The Group's risk management strategy aims to
reduce uncertainty created by the movements in the electricity and gas markets. These exposures are managed by locking into fixed rate price
contracts with suppliers.

Credit risk

Royal Mail operate a Credit Policy, which provides a fair and equitable platform for all its customers to do business with. The level of credit
granted is based on the customer's risk profile. The Credit Policy is applied rigidly within the regulated products area so as to ensure that Royal
‘Mail is not in breach of comptiance legislation. Assessment of credit for the non-regulated products is based on commercial factors, which are
commensurate with the Group's appetite for risk.

Royal Mait has a dedicated credit management team, which set the credit limits, monitor credit limits exceeded on a regular basis and take
corrective action as and when appropriate. Despite all the controls in place Royal Mail does suffer from bad debts, but the level of bad debts
incurred is below 0.2% of turnover.

With respect to credit risk arising from other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash, cash equivalent investments, available for sale
financial assets, held to maturity financial assets, held for trading financial assets, loans and receivables financial assets and certain derivative
instruments, the Group's exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying
amount of these instruments.

There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.

Liquidity risk

The Group's primary objective is to ensure that the Group has sufficient funds available to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. This is
achieved by aligning short-term investments and borrowing facilities with forecast cash flows. Typical short-term investments include money
market funds, time deposits with approved counterparties, UK Government gilts and treasury bills. Borrowing facilities are regularly reviewed to

ensure continuity of funding. Of the current facilities, £300m is uncommitted lines of credit, which are reviewed annually, £1.6bn expires within
5 years,

Hedging Activities

Cashflow hedges

Royal Mail Holdings plc

The Group had four designated cash flow hedge programmes during the year:

POL00362143
POL00362143

i) The diesel fuel hedge pragrammes uses forward commodity price swaps and forward currency purchase contracts to hedge the exposure
arising from commodity price and USS/E exchange rates for forecast dieset fuel purchases.

ii) The air conveyance hedge programme uses USS and euro forward currency purchase contracts to hedge the exposure arising from
USS/GBP and GBP/euro exchange rates for forecast air conveyance purchases.

iii) The euro capital programme uses euro forward currency purchase contracts to hedge the exposure arising from GBP/euro exchange rates

for contracted capitat expenditure.

iv) The US$ capital programme used USS forward currency purchase contracts to hedge the exposure arising from USS/GBP exchange rates
for contracted capital expenditure. This programme matured during the year.

The following tables show the derivatives outstanding at the year end for each of these hedge programmes:

For all the above cash flow hedge programmes, the underlying cash flows being hedged are expected to occur at the same dates as the hedge
instruments (derivatives) mature. For the non-capital programmes (Diesel and Air Conveyance), the profit or loss will be taken on maturity. For
capital programmes, the impact on the income statement will be the depreciation charge over the life of the asset being hedged

In addition to the above hedge programmes, the Group hedges ather foreign exchange and commodity price exposures, which are not
designated as hedges under IAS 39 (including the hedge of currency holdings as part of the Bureau de Change services within Post Office
Limited). The total fair value of the derivatives in these hedge programmes as at 26 March 2006 were fnit assets, and Eni liabilities.

Financial assets and liabilities are a subset of the overall assets and liabilities of the Group and include balances which generally have interest
rate and/or foreign currency risks attached. FRS 13, permits exclusion of items such as trade debtors, trade creditors, prepayments and
accruals. The assets and liabilities, which fall under the definition, alang with their fair values, are highlighted in (i) below:

(i) Fair value of financial assets/(liabilities)
Fair value is defined as the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arm's length transaction between informed and

willing parties and is calculated by reference to market rates discounted to current value. Where market rates are not available, fair values
have been calculated by discounting cash flows at prevailing rates transacted at year end exchange rates.

The carrying value of gilts is £141m, of which £134Mm is included in current asset investments above and £7m in the other investments
figures. The Group portfolio of gilt holdings showed a loss of £4m during the financial year when revalued.

The fixed rate sterling financial liabilities of 860m have a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and an average time to maturity of 11 years.
The fixed rate sterling financial assets of £1,148m have a weighted average interest rate of 4.73% and an average time to maturity of 46 days.

The floating rate sterling financial assets have a weighted average interest rate of bank rate minus 1% and an average time to maturity of one
day.

The fixed rate euro financial liabilities have a weighted average interest rate of 6.1% and average time to maturity of four years.

The floating rate euro financial liabilities have a weighted average interest rate of euro LIBOR plus 2% and an average time to maturity of three
years. The floating rate euro financial assets have a weighted average interest rate of bank rate minus 1% and an average time to maturity of
one day.

Of the £347m of non-interest bearing financial liabilities, £323m is payable on demand and £24m has an average maturity date of one year.
All the non-interest bearing financial assets are receivable on demand.

A one-percentage increase in interest rates throughout the period would have increased profit before tax by £1.1m.

(vii) Gains and losses on transactional exposures

The Group's currency transactional exposures give rise to net currency gains and losses recognised in the profit and loss account. These
liabilities arise from the net payments due to overseas postal administrations for delivery of mail, and are denominated in Special Drawing
Rights (SDR). This is a basket of currencies comprising US Dollar, euro, Japanese Yen and Sterling. Such exposures comprise the monetary
liabilities of the Group that are not denominated in the functional currency of the operating unit involved.

For 2005 there was no material unhedged SDR exposure.

At 27 March 2005, the Group also held various open forward contracts that were taken out to hedge expected future foreign currency
payments {as shown in note (vi) above).

(viii) Gains and losses on hedges

Foreign exchange exposures are hedged using currency deposits, currency borrowings, forward currency contracts and currency options. Gains
and losses on these instruments are not recognised until the hedged exposure itself is recognised. Unrecognised gains and losses on these
instruments used for hedging are nat material.

Commodity price exposures are hedged using commodity swaps and options. Gains and losses on these instruments are not recognised until
the hedged exposure itself is recognised. Unrecognised gains at the start of the financial year totalled £m and were all realised in the current
financial year. Unrecognised gains at the end of the financial year totalled £8m and are all expected to be realised in the next financial year.
There are no gains/tosses carried forward in the balance sheet.

31. Transition to IFRSs
The Royal Mail Holdings plc (Royal Mail) financial year ends on the last Sunday in March.

in previous years, the accounts have been prepared under UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (UK GAAP). From this accounting year Royal
Mail will produce its consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the
European Union (EU).

This nate explains how the Group's previously reported financial performance and position are reported under IFRS. The note includes the following
financial statements restated on an IFRSs basis:

. The Group's consolidated balance sheet at 29 March 2004, the Group’s date of transition;

. The Group's income statement, statement of recognised income and expense (SORIE) and cash flow statement for the year ended
27 March 2005, and balance sheet at 27 March 2005; and

. The Group's balance sheet at 28 March 2005 reflecting the adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39 for the 2005-06 financial year.

Basis of preparation
The restated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with IFRS’s that had been issued and adopted by the EU at 26 March
2006 and use the historic cast convention with the exception of derivative financial instruments that have been measured at fair value.

The rules for first time adoption of IFRS are set out in IFRS 4 ‘First Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards’. IFRS 1 requires an
entity to comply with each IFRS effective at the reporting date for its first full set of IFRS financial statements. As a general principle IFRS 4 requires the
standards effective at the reporting date to be applied retrospectively. However, retrospective application is prohibited in some areas, particularly where
retrospective application would require judgements by management after the outcome of the particular transaction is already known. In addition a
number of limited optional exemptions from full retrospective application of IFRS are granted where the cost of compliance is deemed to exceed the
benefits to users of the financial statements. Where applicable, the options selected by management are set out in the notes to the accounts and below.

The significant changes as a result of the adaption of IFRSs are detailed below:

Balance sheet reclassifications
To aid comparability the UK GAAP format has been reconfigured into the {FRSs format as far as possible from the available, previously published
information. The balance sheet reclassifications required by IFRS are as follows:

D} IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’ requires intangible assets to be separated from goodwill on the balance sheet. At March 2004
£107m was reclassified from intangible assets to goodwill (March 2005 £129m);

ii) At March 2004 long-term debtors previously included within trade and other receivables in current assets under UK GAAP of £14m are
included within non-current assets under IFRSs (March 2005 £14m);

iii) A deferred tax asset of Enil at March 2004 (March 2005 £116m) was also included within trade and other receivables in current assets under
UK GAAP and is now disclosed separately within non-current assets under IFRSs;

iv) At March 2004 trade and other payables under UK GAAP include £10m (March 2005 Enil) and £53m (March 2005 £375m) for income tax
payable and bank loans respectively. These figures are disclosed separately as current liabilities under IFRSs;

v) IFRS requires provisions expected to be settled within one year of the balance sheet date to be shown within current liabilities. This has resulted
ina reclassification of £408m at March 2004 (March 2005 £124m) from non-current liabilities;

vi) Deferred income tax liabilities at March 2004 are also included in provisions under UK GAAP and £96m (March 2005 £94m) is shown
separately as a non-current liability under IFRSs;

vii) Interest bearing loans under UK GAAP are included in “other payables” at March 2004. These are disclosed separately under IFRSs and £507m
(March 2005 £506m) has been reclassified within non-current liabilities; and

vili) _IFRSs requires that foreign currency translation within reserves is separately identified on the face of the balance sheet. There is no
reclassification required at March 2004 as the Group has elected not to apply IAS 21 retrospectively. The effect at March 2005 is £8m.

IAS 19 Employee benefits

IAS 19 requires separate recognition of the operating and financing costs of defined benefit pension schemes, together with other employee benefits, in
the income statement. The standard permits a number of options for the recagnition of actuarial gains and losses. Royal Mail has adopted the IFRS 1
transitional exemption and recognised the full actuarial pension deficit at the date of transition. The business will then recognise any actuarial gains and
losses immediately in the SORIE. The option to account for actuarial gains and losses in this way is part of an amendment to IAS 19 ‘Actuarial Gains and
Losses, Group Plans and Disclosures’. This amendment is effective from 1 January 2006 with earlier adoption allowed.

‘The impact of the standard on the balance sheet at the date of transition is to recognise a pension liability of some £4.4bn at 29 March 2004 and a
liability of £4.0bn at 27 March 2005. Additionally, pension prepayments of £770m (2005 £834m) have been derecognised.

POL00362143
POL00362143

31. Transition to IFRSs (continued)

The impact of the standard on operating profits before exceptional ites for the year ended 27 March 2005 is a reduction of £98m with an increase to
interest and other financial income of £59m.

Under UK GAAP, Royal Mail did not accrue for annual leave not taken either at the half year or year ends. Under IAS 19 Royal Mail is required to accrue
for all short-term accumulating compensated absences such as holiday entitlement earned but not taken at the balance sheet date. The impact of IAS
19 on Royal Mail's transitional balance sheet is to recognise an annual leave accrual of £40m at 29 March 2004. There is also a charge of £2m to the
March 2005 income statement refiecting the increase in the accrual at that year end.

IFRS 3 Business combinations, IAS 36 Impairment of assets and IAS 38 Intangible assets
IFRS 3 prohibits merger accounting and the amortisation of goodwill. The standard requires goodwill to be carried at cost with impairment reviews both
annually and atso when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable.

‘As permitted in IFRS 1, Royal Mail has chosen to apply IFRS 3 prospectively from the date of transition and has chosen not to restate previous business
combinations. Therefore, goodwill is stated in the transitional balance sheet at its UK GAAP carrying value of £107m with subsequent amortisation in

the year to 27 March 2005 being reversed. The increase in operating profit from reversing goodwill amortisation is £11m for the year to 27 March
2005.

Under IFRS 3, the identification of assets and liabilities within acquired businesses includes intangible assets not previously recognised under UK GAAP.
The principal intangible assets recognised separately from goodwill on an acquisition are listings. These intangible assets are valued for each acquisition
after 29 March 2004 and are amortised over their estimated economic lives.

The principal acquisitions in 2004-05 were of franchisee businesses in GLS Italy and GLS Poland, The value of the customer listings for these
businesses amounted to £6m, with economic lives of 2 to 4 years. in addition, Romec Limited, previously a joint venture, and NDC 2000 Limited,
previously an associate, became subsidiaries of the Group. Neither the Romec Limited nor NDC 2000 Limited acquisitions resulted in the identification of
any intangible assets.

IAS 12 Income taxes

IAS 12 requires entities to calculate deferred tax based on temporary differences, as opposed to timing differences under UK GAAP. Temporary
differences are defined as the difference between the carrying value of assets and liabilities and their tax base. The standard requires deferred tax
assets and liabilities to be disclosed separately on the Group balance sheet.

Whilst the adoption of IAS 12 does not itself result in any restatement of the Group's tax charge, the deferred tax has been reassessed taking into
account other accounting adjustments arising from the transition to IFRSs. The deferred tax liability at the transition date in March 2004 was reduced
from £96m to £1m due to derecognition of the pension prepayment and the recognition of a defined benefit pension liability. Similarly, in the balance
sheet at March 2005 an additional £318m of deferred tax asset and a reduction in deferred tax liability of £89m is recognised.

IAS 7 Cash flow statements

Under UK GAAP the cash flow statement focuses on movements in cash with details of these movements under seven headings. Under IAS 7 the focus,
is widened to cash and cash equivalents and details are classified under three headings - operational, investing and financing, The transition does not
alter the Group's cash flow but the presentation of information on the cash flow statement changes. £3:16m and £450m of investments in March 2004
and March 2005 respectively, are now classified as cash equivalents. These are now reconciled within the cash flow statement rather than being
disclosed under the heading of ‘management of liquid resources’ under UK GAAP. The Group continues to produce its cash flow statement using the
indirect method.

SIC 15 Operating leases - incentives

This interpretation requires that all incentives for the agreement of a new or renewed operating lease should be recognised as an integral part of the
net consideration agreed for the use of the lease, irrespective of the incentive's nature or form or the timing of the payments. Lessees must recognise
the aggregate benefit of incentives as a reduction of rental expense aver the lease term, on a straight-line basis,

The Group has recognised lease incentives of £8m at the date of transition at March 2004, This has been amortised by £1m during 2004-05 leaving a
balance of £7m on the balance sheet at 27 March 2005.

JAS 32 and IAS 39 Financial instruments
‘The requirements of IFRSs are different to UK GAAP in a number of areas. The changes that impact Royal Mail relate to hedging instruments and
investments, Royal Mail has taken advantage of the exemption not to adopt IAS 32 and IAS 39 until the 2005-06 financial year.

Hedging instruments

Under (AS 39, all financial assets and liabilities are recognised at fair value with the corresponding debit entry booked to the hedging reserve in equity
for those instruments which meet the requirement for hedge accounting. Derivative instruments of €9m assets and £1m liabilities have been
recognised at fair value at 28 March 2005.

31, Transition to IFRSs (continued)

Under UK GAAP, foreign exchange gains and losses on an unsettled hedge programme were carried in the balance sheet. On introducing IAS 32 and IAS
39 at 28 March 2005, losses amounting to £11m have been written off against retained earnings.

Investments

Under UK GAAP investments are hetd at cost less provision for any permanent impairment. Under IFRSs, investments are initially recognised at fair
value. The impact at 28 March 2005 is to re-categorise the £69'1m investments on the balance sheet as £134m of ‘Held for trading investments’. and
£549m of ‘Held to maturity investments’ and £8m ‘Loans and receivables’.

The following accounting policies apply:

Financial year

‘The financial year ends on the last Sunday in March and accordingly, these accounts are made up to the 52 weeks ended 26 March 2006 (52
weeks ended 27 March 2005).

losses. The Company has a single investment: Royal Mail Group ple, a 100% subsidiary.

Change in accounting policy

A change in accounting policy for fixed asset investments has been adopted giving rise to a prior period adjustment (see nates 4 and 5). Previously,
investments in internally formed companies were recognised at the net asset value of the internally formed company, The current accounting
policy, as disclosed above, is believed to be more appropriate, providing more relevant and reliable presentation in the accounts. Application of the
current accounting policy in 2005 would have reduced the reported profit for the year from £184m to Eni

Company are paid fees by other companies of the Group. These emoluments are disclosed in the Group accounts.

profit/(loss) for the financiat year arises as a result of the accounting policy on fixed asset investments. This states that investments are stated at
cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Accordingly, the Company's profit for the financial year is eliminated in the Group accounts and does
not therefore form part of the Group results,
