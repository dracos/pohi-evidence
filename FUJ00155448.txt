Diane,

Can you provide re-impacts for ITU based on the statements from George and Sheila below — I think you also ought to

include an assumption statement that this is based on a delivery from Development at the end of June.

This should be testable just by LST. Impact will be approx 15 man days.

Note: We have to be very careful not to put anything on the LST rig that could destabilise it and/or prevent live fixes
being tested.

For instance in this case if LST take the release to test this and then an urgent audit problem emerges, the CP release
would probably have to be regressed

David,
How do you want this impacted given that it’s being delivered post Rel1 - do we assume SV&I continuing or do we
load LST with the complete impact.

Reading the CP suggests that it ought to be testable just by LST - Sheila any views? What's the combined SVI/LST
impact ?

Penny, our comments were in the web dump. Basically this CP has missed the testing slots for SV&l.
Until we know when this will be delivered into ITU we cannot impact.
I recommend that this is now deferred into a release after Release 1.

George

Peter, Penny,
Please find attached the web dump for your CP as requested.
I have highlighted the various impacts to assist in the completion of the Impact Spreadsheet (template also attached).

Additionally in the right most columns — where they are not greyed out the impact on that line has a
commentobservation/assumption/query that needs to be addressed or answered or maybe just acknowledged
(updating the copy and returning to ChM when completed.

Please can you review and left me know whether you wish it to go to PCCB on Thursday or not?
Any problems, please let me know
