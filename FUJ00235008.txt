FUJITSU FUJITSU RESTRICTED (COMMERCIAL IN
CONFIDENCE)

1 Introduction

A privileged account has additional abilities to a "standard" user account. Privileged accounts may be
machine accounts or accounts allocated to individual development or support staff. Privileges may
include access rights to operating systems or to application software and databases.

System privileges and levels of access required to perform management functions are higher than those
assigned to standard users. Therefore, the allocation and use of privileges is restricted and controlled,
and the principle of least privilege is used. The principle of least privilege refers to the concept and
practice of restricting access rights to only those resources absolutely required to perform the authorised
activities. Individuals should not be granted unnecessary privileges.

The purpose of this Privileged Account Policy is to set a standard for creating, protecting, and managing
all privileged accounts on the Post Office Account (POA).

The privileged account types on the POA are as follows:
e Personal Privileged — Individual privileged accounts
e Shared Privileged — Shared privileged accounts
¢ Local Administrator — Local host admin access accounts
¢ Domain Administrator — Domain admin access accounts
¢ Database Administrator — Database admin accounts
« Network Administrator — Network admin accounts
e Application Administrator — Admin accounts for specific applications or appliances
¢ Built-in Administrator — Vendor default admin accounts that must be retained

« Service Accounts — Local or domain non-interactive system accounts (including MSAD Service
Accounts)

Note: Some accounts may meet the definition of more than one type e.g. a Built-in Administrator account that is also
Shared Privileged as it is needed by a team that manage the applicable system

The Master Policy rules set a vision for POA. If POA deployed Privileged Access Management (PAM)
toolsets, then these rules would be integral to that solution. POA does not have such a toolset, so some
of the Master Policy rules are challenging, or impractical to achieve. Every effort must be made when
changes are implemented in any parts of the solutions on POA to move towards compliance with the
Master Policy. Compliance with the Master Policy is considered highly desirable for all privileged
accounts in use on POA

The Sub-Master Policy rules, however, are deemed to be achievable within the POA solutions deployed
despite the absence of PAM toolsets. Although they may incur additional manual processes they can be
operated and complied with. Complying with the Sub-Master Policy is mandatory on POA and ensures a
significant alignment to the Master Policy too.

The Password Policy is referred to in both the Master and Sub-Master Policies and compliance is
considered mandatory for all privileged accounts in use on POA.

POA SecOps maintain a Privileged Account Register of all privileged accounts which includes their
compliance to the Master Policy, Sub-Master Policy and Password Policy. Exceptions are recorded on
the Privileged Account Register along with the reason for non-compliance. This allows POA SecOps to
decide if it is necessary to challenge the non-compliance or accept the reason as appropriate and thereby
agree to the exception to compliance to any specific rules.

The Password Policy is referred to in both the Master and Sub-Master Policies and compliance is
considered mandatory for all privileged accounts in use on POA. The Password Policy is incremental to
any password rules stated in the Europe Business Management System (EBMS) and applies more
stringent local rules for POA.

Table 5 — Password Policy Rules

Whilst it is acknowledged that current advice for human passwords is that they are not rotated regularly
(ie. do not expire), that they do not have these types of complexity rules, and that longer passwords are
more secure than complex passwords and more importantly are easier to remember, there are
constraints within the POA deployed solutions that would make this difficult to deploy unilaterally.

See https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.htmli#appA for additional information.

It is recommended, particularly for human accounts, that long passwords are used.

4.2 MSAD Account Password Policy

POA Password Policy is managed by POA SecOps and the following minimum criteria, further detailed in

DEV/APP/LLD/0028, should be followed where the system allows:

Enforce password history 24 passwords 24 0
remembered

Maximum password age (7 30 days 30 0

Minimum password age @ 7 days 7 0

Minimum password length 74 characters 6 Pd

Password must meet complexity Enabled Enabled Enabled

Store passwords using reversible Disabled Disabled Disabled

encryption

Table 6 - MSAD Account Password Policy

[1] Maximum password age and expiration notification: Maximum password age must be always
higher than minimum password age unless it is set to 0 (password never expires).

[2] Minimum password age: To avoid potential password sync conflicts and prevent users from
bypassing the password history policy.

4.3 Account Ownership

Where possible, privileged accounts should be centrally managed by POA SecOps. Centralising
management of such credentials is a step forward to limit the potential for misuse of privileged accounts.
This should include accounts that do not comply with Sub-Master Policy rule 9 (SMPOQ). Access to these
centrally managed accounts will then follow the POA Privileged Account Release Procedure
(SVM/SDM/PRO/4537).

4.4 Account Lifecycle

Privileged accounts should be created and disabled through the Joiners, Movers and Leavers (JML)
process for POA. All account requests must follow the POA JML process.

4.5 Guidance on Selecting Strong Passwords

4.5.1. Risks with weak Passwords

If someone else obtains your passwords, they may use your account to perform actions or to commit
crimes and all transactions they perform will be performed in your name. If it cannot be proven that
anyone else was using your account, or it is proven that you failed to adequately protect your password,
you may be held accountable for all actions performed using your account and for any damage caused
by that use.

The longer and more complex a password, the safer it is against hacking attacks. However, it is also
more difficult to remember, especially when it must be changed frequently. Choosing a secure password
which can be remembered easily is therefore challenging.

4.5.2 Selecting a Secure Password

Selecting a secure password is important. The password is used by the computer to verify the user, so
pick a password that cannot be guessed by others.

Cyber criminals use sophisticated tools and common password databases that can rapidly decipher
passwords. The top reasons people gain unauthorised access to a password protected system are:

e They guessed someone's password (often because they found it on a piece of paper next to the
victim's computer).

« They saw the person type the password in
e They use software programs that are very good at guessing common passwords.

e The password was intercepted between the user and the application due to lack of encryption at
the network layer.

The following guidelines should guard against someone finding out your password and using your
account without your permission:

e Make your password as long as possible. The longer it is, the more difficult it will be to attack the
password with a brute-force search. Fujitsu applications and systems may vary in what they
enforce as the minimum password length (due to application and system constraints), but you
can use longer passwords — and for privileged accounts, POA mandates at least a 16 character
password.

e Use as many different characters as possible when forming your password. Use numbers,
punctuation characters and mixed upper and lower-case letters. Choosing characters from the
largest possible alphabet will make your password more secure by requiring more effort by
someone to guess it correctly.

« Do not use personal information in your password that someone else is likely to be able to figure
out. Things like your name, phone number, and address are to be avoided. Even names of
acquaintances, pets, sports teams, hobbies and family names should not be used.

e Do not use words, geographical names, or biographical names that are listed in standard
dictionaries.

e Never use a password that is the same as your account number.
e Do not use passwords that are easy to spot while you're typing them in. Passwords like 12345,
qwerty (i.e., all keys right next to each other), or nnnnnn should be avoided.
4.5.3 Difficulties selecting a Secure Password
If you are having difficulty picking a good password, some good methods include:

e Use a long phrase you can easily remember and apply different capitalisation and special
characters. Some examples:

o “Paris is my kind of place to eat cheese” could be “Paris-is.my-kind.of-place.to-
eat.cheese”

o “My computer is 5 years old and slow” could be “MY ComputeR IS FivE YearS OID AnD
Slow”

e Use the first letter of each word in a phrase you can easily remember. Some examples:
co “Paris is my kind of place to eat cheese” would be “Pimkop2ec”

o “My computer is 5 years old and slow” would be “Mci5yo&s”

o “lam 28 and Madonna is a star” would be “la28&Mia*”
e Use a phrase instead of a word:
o Todayis32degrees!
o Coffee&twobiscuits4me
e Join two (or more) completely unrelated words with symbols:
o Yellow%thoughtful
o teabags$$Advocate

o — airline*(punctual)

4.5.4 Things to Avoid as Passwords

Here are some guidelines of what not to include in your password:

« Names, including any part of your name, your spouse's name, your parent's or children's name,
your pet's name

« Names of your boss, close friends or co-workers, or favourite fantasy characters
e The name of the operating system you're using, or the hostname of your computer

e Other information that is easily obtained about you, including phone numbers, birth dates, car
licence plates etc

e Words such as wizard, guru, Gandalf etc — although this is ok if combined with many other words
to create a longer phrase

e Any username on the computer in any form (as is, capitalised, etc.)

« Adictionary word, in any language— although this is ok if combined with many other words to
create a longer phrase

e Aplace name- although this is ok if combined with many other words to create a longer phrase
e Passwords of all the same letter (typically prevented by system policy)

e Simple patterns on the keyboard, like qwerty (typically prevented by system policy)

e Any of the above spelled backwards (typically prevented by system policy)

e Any of the above followed or pre-pended by a single digit

e Avoid simple things like words spelled backwards, or common substitutions like ‘3° for ‘e' etc

5 Password Handling and Protection
5.1 MSAD Accounts

5.1.1 Initial Password Allocation

The following requirements are to be met when creating or supplying a password to a user for the first
time or after a password has been reset:

« Users must be provided initially with a secure temporary password which they are forced to
change immediately.

e Temporary passwords provided to a user must be unique (i.e. not the same password supplied to
every user).

« Temporary passwords must meet password complexity requirements in the previous section.

When a user requests their password to be reset:
e Support staff are required to validate the identity of the user.

e Users should be provided initially with a secure temporary password, which they are forced to
change immediately.

« Where phone calls to help desk agents are involved, identification of the user is mandatory, for
example, use of the users’ UK personnel number.

5.2 Storage of Privileged Passwords

Passwords for any privileged account must be stored in a Fujitsu approved secure storage system or not
stored at all (MP15 / SMP16).

Access controls within the password storage system are to be implemented in a manner which ensures
access to passwords is only possible to defined personnel for legitimate business reasons.

5.3 Network Transmission

The passwords for data that has been shared should not be transmitted via the same medium. It is much
more difficult for an adversary to combine data from two sources (e.g. Teams and Email) to decrypt the
data.

Using public key cryptography (i.e. gpg, pgp) removes the secure key exchange problem for symmetric
keys. The first recommendation should be to use asymmetric keys if possible, followed by the secure
exchange of symmetric keys if asymmetric is not possible.

5.4 Built-in Administrator Accounts

Built-in Administrator accounts should be disabled and POA defined accounts should be setup instead
wherever possible.

Default vendor passwords for Built-in Administrator accounts should be changed during the installation of
applications, systems and network devices wherever possible.

Built-in Administrator accounts should be handed over to POA SecOps for central ownership and
management under the Privileged Account Release Procedure wherever possible.

5.5 Oracle Privileged Access Management

To enhance auditability, POA Oracle users are required to work as described in Appendix A.

Auditing relies on the unix /var/log/secure syslog file and the Oracle audit. Sudo commands are logged to
ivar/log/secure and Oracle commands are logged to the audit destination as defined by the Oracle
database audit parameter audit_file_dest.

Users accessing Oracle from their own user account without escalating to SYSDBA are logged in the
SYS.AUD$ table as their user id. Users accessing Oracle via sudo using another account (oracle or grid
for example) have their session logged as the target account. In this instance a combined review of the
/var/log/audit and Oracle audit is required to correlate user activity.

Refer to Appendix A for further policy information.

oe) POA Privileged Account Policy
FUJITSU FUJITSU RESTRICTED (COMMERCIAL IN
CONFIDENCE)

For privileged accounts managed by SecOps, PP08 (30 day password rotation) does not apply as the
passwords are rotated on each use as per the POA Privileged Account Release Procedure
[SVM/SEC/PRO/4537]

Rotation of the password is dependent on access levels. POA SecOps will use one of the following
methods to securely rotate passwords.

e Where POA SecOps can access the infrastructure/applications/devices, they will rotate the
password themselves in a controlled manner that is tracked with date/time stamp.

e Where POA SecOps do not have access, they will initiate password rotation by means of an
incident ticket reference, screen share with an Individual Privileged user and a “baton pass”
approach will be used where the user gives POA SecOps control of the session so they can input
the new password known only to them.

« Where none of the above apply, then POA SecOps will initiate password rotation by means of an
incident ticket reference, screen share with an Individual Privileged user, and then a verbal
communication of the new password which will be witnessed as being typed in. There will be no
written password confirmation making it extremely unlikely that the Individual Privileged user will
remember the complex password used. Any verbal communication should also ensure it has not
been recorded.

Once the password is successfully rotated, this is then under control and management of POA SecOps.

5.7 SecOps Managed Privileged Account Release Policy

Requesting and releasing of POA SecOps centrally controlled privileged account details must follow the
POA Privileged Account Release Procedure (SVM/SDM/PRO/4537). This will ensure adherence to the
following release process rules:

RPO1 Requests for privileged accounts are made via the agreed request Yes
process (e.g. TfSNow)

RPO2 Requests for multiple privileged accounts are made separately and Yes
following the agreed request process (e.g. TfSNow)

RPO3 Requests for privileged accounts are made with documented Yes
justifications which must include timescales over which the credentials
will be needed (e.g. within the TfSNow ticket)

RPO4 Requests for privileged accounts are approved by the designated Yes
authorising party(ies) as recorded in the Register. A requestor cannot
self-authorise

RPOS Approvals for release of privileged accounts are documented (e.g. Yes
within the TfSNow ticket)

RPO6 Privileged accounts are only made available for the approved time Yes
period

RPO7 The password is changed (as per the password policy rules) when the I Yes

privileged account is returned, or the end time period is reached

RPO8& The details of the request, approval, time period, and password Yes
change actions are recorded in a central log for at least 12 months

CONFIDENCE)

Passwords should be treated as confidential information. No employee is allowed to handover their own
account password to another person, including IT staff, administrators, superiors, other colleagues, friends,
or family members. Any Shared Privileged accounts managed by local POA teams must comply with the
Sub-Master and Password Policies and must be administered as stated in the section above “Storage of
Privileged Passwords”.

If someone demands your password or you suspect someone knows your password or is using your
account, immediately contact POA SecOps to raise a Security Incident.

5.9 Protecting Passwords

Ata minimum the following steps are to be taken to protect passwords:
« Users must be able to change non-centrally managed passwords themselves.
e Avoid typing your password in the presence of others.

e Passwords must be kept securely and must not be accessible for anyone else (e.g.
programmable keys on the keyboard or written on paper and placed under the keyboard).

o If you have difficulty in remembering your password, store it in a password safe or
encrypted file.

e Passwords must not be stored in any applications, system folders or Cookies

co If you have difficulty in remembering your password, store it in a password safe or
encrypted file.

e “Remember password” or "Save automatically" features of applications should be avoided

o Web browser password managers can be used provided the “synchronise passwords”
feature is avoided so the passwords are only stored locally

e If possible, don't use the same password to access multiple company systems unless this is
controlled by a Fujitsu approved Single Sign On (SSO) solution.

6 Service Accounts

6.1 Service Account creation

Service Accounts should be requested via the POA JML process so that they are correctly approved and
recorded on the Privileged Account Register maintained by POA SecOps. Where they are generated
automatically by systems, POA SecOps should be notified of the Service Accounts created so they can
be recorded.

The platform and/or service owner should complete the relevant JML form that is available from POA
SecOps or from the POA intranet page. There are several fields that must be completed. These will be
checked before approval is granted for the new service account to be created at which point POA
SecOps will raise tickets in either TfSNow or Peak for the relevant system owner to create the approved
service account.

POA Integration may also be requested to create an updated baseline containing the service account
details (account name and password) which would then go to POA Release Management for the
planning and deployment of the new service account to be scheduled into a release specific for each
environment.

All service account requests must be based on the principle of least privilege ensuring the accounts
created have only the privileges required to conduct each task they have been created for. Using
distinctive service accounts for each task is a stronger security practice and adheres to service account
isolation. By doing this, it prevents increased privileges on any one account which can happen when a
service account is used for multiple services, resulting in merged privileges which then violates the
principle of least privilege. By adhering to the principle of least privilege and service account isolation, this

helps to reduce the attack surface and lateral movement between services should an account be
compromised.

6.2 Service Account password storage

Service Account passwords are set not to expire by design. This is typically because if a service account
password expires, the service the account supports may cease to work.

If a Service Account password is compromised in any way, it should be changed.

6.3 Requesting a Service Account password change

If there is a need to change a service account password, the platform/service owner who requires the
Servi nt password to be changed should contact POA SecOps (email:
with details of the service account. Details to include:

« What service(s) the account supports
e The Service Account name
e What platforms and/or domain account the service account is to be deployed to

« Why the service account needs to be changed

6.4 Changing a Service Account password

The process is described in “Changing Passwords for Centrally Managed Accounts” above.

6.5 Deleting/Disabling a Service Account

If a Service Account is no longer in use, it should be disabled. The POA JML process should be followed
using a “Leaver” notification.

POA SecOps will then manage the process of the controlled removal of the service account.

A Appendix — Oracle Privileged Access Management
Ways of working

A.1 Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)

e POA Oracle database access must comply with the following directives:
e Users use their own user account to access the databases via sqlplus

e All sudo access must be initiated from the users own MSAD account on the server hosting the
database to be accessed

e Users may sudo to the grid user but may only access the ASM SID database instance as
SYSASM

e sudo must not be used to open an interactive shell to either the oracle or grid users (opening a
unix shell via sudo as the oracle or grid users means subsequent commands (sqjplus for
example) are attributed to the sudo user rather than the original user. Running a command as
oracle or grid users via sudo is logged to /var/log/secure and is attributable to the original user.)

A.2 Exceptional access to Oracle user account

Access other than that defined in the SOP above may be granted according to the following directives:
e Access outside of the SOP requires authorisation from POA SecOps
« ATfSNow incident must be raised to record the reason for the access and the duration

e The TfSNow incident should be raised in advance of the access but may be raised
retrospectively where a live incident takes precedence

Access must be for the minimum time required to resolve the issue

e The PuTTY session must be recorded (via the PUTTY logging mechanism) and a copy of the
PuTTY session log must be attached to the TfSNow incident

POA SecOps must be informed when the exceptional access is terminated.

A.3 Access examples
A.3.1 SOP access examples:

« Generic form to run any command as the logged in user or as the grid or oracle users:

<comt

d1>[¢<con

and N>]

e Access an interactive sqlplus prompt as the logged in user who is a member of the unix dba
group:

sqlplus / as SYSDBA
e Runa database query as the logged in user:

expo.

ORACLE_SID=BRDB1; echo ‘show parameter audit' I sqlplus / as SYSDBA I
grep audit_file dest

e Generic form to run any command as the grid or oracle users:

sudo -u <oracleIgrid> -i /bin/bash -c "<command1>[;<comman:

e Examine an audit file for the oracle or grid users

ex) ORACLE_SID=BRDB1; echo 'show parameter audit' I sqlplus / as SYSDBA I
grep audit_file_dest

A.3.3 Not permitted examples:

e Open an interactive shell as root to subsequently su to oracle or grid users:

sudo su -
su - <oracleIgrid>

A.4 sudoers modifications

DES/SEC/ION/2591 describes the sudoers integration with AD via sssd. Changes are required to the
sudoers AD delivery to facilitate limited user access to the grid and oracle accounts without requiring root
access.

The following configuration snippet permits members of the dba unix group access to the oracle and grid
accounts on the Oracle database servers defined in the ORACLEDBSERVERS Host_Alias to execute
any command.
