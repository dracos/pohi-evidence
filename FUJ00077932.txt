7.4 I DM to chase POCL with respect to the MiMAN reference data issues Ongoing
© Incremental reference data later than 10/11/99 may miss test windows although specific testing I Tgt
can be carried out between 10-16/11/99 so as to meet SIP16 dates. Anything after that will cause I 16/2/00
slippage in the plans.
¢ This issue/risk was realised on 5/11/99 when POCL decided they couldn’t fix the existing Type
B data and would need to issue a new baseline & incremental drop ~ due by 11/11. Live date for
SIP16 can still be held (just) — but LRDP window is reduced and testing window extended to
prove new data.
¢ SIP 16 Ref Data issues addressed and now (mostly) resolved
e —DR/PJ to pursue ownership/management of POCL Ref Data interface from a Dev. Directorate
angle
¢ Carried Forward — session still required within Dev Directorate & then with CS to ensure
consistent Pathway views. LH also requested that RDMC changes figure in the session.
