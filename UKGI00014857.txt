Dear Sirs

Post Office Limited v Seema Misra
Guildford Crown Court

Thank you for your letter.

You may recollect that at the Plea and Case Management Hearing on 20" March last
His Honour Judge Critchlow directed that a further amended Defence Case Statement
be served which identified those persons working at the Post Office which Ms Misra
suspected of having been responsible for the theft of the monies.

Rather than file a further Defence Case Statement it is probably easier if we simply
provide you with their details which are as follows:-

-shikhar Saxena

We can confirm that we have instructed Mr Andrew Turton of Carmelite Chambers to
represent our client at trial.

Also at 2 Wey Court, Mary Road, Guillord, Surrey
