ANNEX 1
1. Introduction

This paper provides a summary of all Horizon and HNG-X Change Requests or other
agreed changes that have been raised and approved by Fujitsu Services since the date of
the HNG-X Contract and which align with the V0.80.A20 plan (as at 28th September 2009).

These Change requests are solely those that apply to the development of the initial release
of HNG-X.

Change requests that are applicable to HNG-X may also have a commercial impact. This is
managed via the Change Management process and agreed via the appropriate Change
Work Order documentation.

The process for applying the effect of the approved CRs is summarised in section 4.

The cost of any development labour in the changes listed in this document, together with
the development labour costs related to the HNG-X Initial Requirements Baseline are all
included in the HNG-X Project Price.

Status as at date of HNG-X Contract.

At the date of the HNG-X contract a number of post-S92 approved Change Requests were
agreed to be included in the POL Initial Requirements Baseline. These are listed in
Schedule B6.1 — Annex 13 and in section 2.1 below.

Current Status

Section 2.3 comprises summary details of approved CRs that have been raised subsequent
to the date of the HNG-X Contract with those that are applicable to HNG-X in section 2.3.1
and those that were signed post-CCN1246 section 2.3.2. Section 3 provides a summary of
raised but not approved CRs that may have applicability. This will be confirmed once the CR
has been approved.

Withdrawn CRs are not included in any of these lists.

This document is updated periodically with the latest approved Change Requests and
issued to POL for agreement. Subsequently POL and FS will review the newly applicable
changes and agree how they are to be applied to the HNG-X functional or non-functional

requirements.

Note — FS Change Management also provide summarised information of agreed Change
Requests to POL. This information is reconciled with the details in this paper.
