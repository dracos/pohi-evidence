                      POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY




      FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF SUSANNE JANE HELLIWELL


I, SUSANNE JANE HELLIWELL, will say as follows:


1.    This witness statement is made to assist the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry (the
      "Inquiry") with the matters set out in the Rule 9 Request dated 19 May 2023.


Background

2.    1 have a 2.2 degree from Leeds University. I was admitted as a Solicitor in 1990
      and save for a period of approximately 3-4 years when I set up my own business
      outside of the law, I have practised as a Solicitor since 1990.


3.    I am a former employee of Weightmans Solicitors (formerly Weightman Vizards)
      where I held the position of Solicitor and then Associate. I was employed by
      Weightmans from January 2000 until around July 2005. I then set up my own
      business, a ladies' fashion boutique, which commenced trading in early 2006
      and ceased trading in the summer of 2009. I joined Lockett Loveday McMahon
      Solicitors in Manchester in or around later summer 2009 where I was employed
      until February 2019.


4.    I am currently a self-employed Consultant engaged under a Consultancy
      Agreement with Lockett Loveday McMahon.

                                                                                         W ITN09420100




Post Office Limited v Mrs J Woistenholme


Prior knowledge and involvement


5.    1 cannot specifically recall when I first became involved in these proceedings. I
      do however note from Trial Bundle A (POL00118218) that the proceedings were
      initially issued and dealt with by the Legal Services Department of Consignia
      plc. I would therefore have become involved at some point after the issue of
      the proceedings in 2001 and prior to the preparation of the Amended Particulars
      of Claim in February 2003. Weightmans acted for the Post Office at that time
      in respect of employment claims and other areas of litigation. I was in the
      employment/commercial litigation department and this case was assigned to
      me. Whilst the case was assigned to me which meant that I had the day to day
      conduct of it, I would have been acting under the general supervision of the
      partner with responsibility for this particular client. I cannot recall which partner
      at Weightmans had responsibility for the Post Office at this time.


6     To the best of my recollection Mrs Wolstenholme's case was                  the first
      proceedings which I was involved in concerning the Horizon IT System.
      Previously I had no knowledge of the Horizon IT System.


My recollection of the proceedings

7.    I have been asked to consider various documents which have been provided
      to me by the Inquiry. These documents are set out in the Index to my witness
      statement.


8.    Within the Rule 9 Request, I am asked to respond to various questions. I am
      asked to set out my recollection of this matter and exhibit any relevant
      documents.

9.    Whilst as a result of being provided with the documents I identify and exhibit, I
      do recall this particular case, my recollection is very limited as my last
      involvement was approximately 19 years ago. I recall the proceedings were

                                                                                         W ITNO9420100
                                                                                     W ITN09420100




      commenced against Mrs Wolstenholme by the Post Office in the Blackpool
      County Court claiming sums due arising from losses claimed by the Post Office
      whilst Mrs Wolstenholme was a Subpostmaster at Cleveleys Post Office and
      the return of equipment.

10.   1 also recall that Mrs Wolstenholme defended the proceedings claiming that
      there were issues with the Horizon system which, she claimed were responsible
      for incorrectly showing that there were losses on the account. I further recall
      that Mrs Wolstenholme pursued a Counterclaim against the Post Office but until
      my consideration of POL00118218 did not recall the specific nature of it. Whilst
      I recall that the proceedings were settled, I cannot recall the terms agreed and
      nor specifically when that agreement was reached. I have considered the
      Advice on Evidence and Quantum by S.A. Brochwicz-Lewinski (POL00118229)
      and having done so now recall that a payment into Court had been made by
      the Post Office, at the time of the Advice in July 2004, the Trial was only one
      month away. The Trial Bundle was prepared in preparation for the Trial which
      had been listed for three days commencing on 16 August 2004 (P112 of
      POL00118218).

11.   I left Weightmans approximately 18 years ago. I have not retained no client
      papers whether for this matter or at all from my time at Weightmans and nor
      would it have been appropriate for me to do so.

12.   I understand that the Inquiry is seeking a detailed account of my involvement
      at all stages in these proceedings. Unfortunately, given the passage of time, I
      am unable to provide this.       I am however assisted by Trial Bundle A at
      POL00118218 and part of Trial Bundle Cat POL00118221 which provide some
      account of my involvement in the proceedings. I am asked, in particular, to
      address particular matters, namely:

      (i)    The instructions I received from the Post Office before I began working
             on this case and any subsequent instructions I received;


      (ii)   Who my primary contact was at (1) the Post Office and (2) Fujitsu
             Services in relation to this case;

                                      Page3of10
                                                                                           WI TNO9420100
                                                                                      WI TN09420100




      (iii)   Whether I advised on the merits of the case;

      (iv)    Who else from Weightmans was involved in the case and, if so, what
              their role was;

      (v)     Which of the documents set out in the Index to my witness statement I
              was involved in drafting andlor editing and in relation to any documents
              I drafted, I am asked to identify the sources of information I used.

13.   In response to the numbered points set out paragraph 12 above:


      (i)     I cannot recall the instructions I received from the Post Office before I
              began working on this case and any subsequent instructions I received.
              I can however state that, at all times, I acted in accordance with the
              information and instructions received from the Post Office;


      (ii)    I recall that my primary contact at the Post Office on this case was Jim
              Cruise and subsequently Mandy Talbot. I do not recall having a primary
              contact at Fujitsu as Weightmans were acting on behalf of the Post Office
              and not Fujitsu Services. Any contact I had with Fujitsu Services would
              have been primarily in relation to witness statements;

      (iii)   Whilst I cannot recall when and what advice I gave, I would have advised
              on the merits of the case pm the payment into Court. I would also have
              advised that an Advice from Counsel be obtained on evidence and
              quantum (POLOO118229);

      (iv)    I cannot recall who else from Weightmans was involved in the case save
              that, as stated in paragraph 5 above, I would have been acting under the
              general supervision of the partner with responsibility for this particular
              client and I would have reported to that particular partner from time to
              time on the progress of the case and during any file review meetings;

      (v)     I drafted the emails and correspondence from myself to the various
              individuals to whom the emails and correspondence were addressed.

                                                                                        W ITN09420100




             To the best of my recollection, I was involved in the drafting of the witness
             statements of Keith Baines and Jan Holmes. The sources of information
             used for such purposes would have been the written and verbal
             comments of the individuals concerned and documents provided by the
             Post Office and Fujitsu Services.


14.   I am asked to consider Keith Baines' witness statement at POL00095374. As
      stated above, I believe I was involved in drafting this witness statement. To the
      best of my recollection, the process by which I compiled this statement and the
      sources of information used were written and verbal comments and material
      information provided by Keith Baines. I should also state that in the case of this
      statement and indeed all witness statements, Counsel was instructed to review
      and advise on any amendments and ultimately approve them.


IVIy relllationship with individuals at the Post Office and Fujitsu Services

15.   It must be appreciated that I was not a key individual in the Weightmans/Post
      Office relationship, I was a fee-earner assigned to deal with cases, reporting to
      a partner at Weightmans. I did not deal with senior individuals at the Post Office.
      However as far as I can recall, I can confirm that it was positive with no issues
      and a usual solicitor/client relationship. I am also asked what was my view of
      their approach to these proceedings. To the best of my recollections their
      approach to the proceedings was based on the information available to them at
      the time from individuals within the organisation and Fujitsu Services.

16.   Fujitsu Services were not Weightmans' client. Weightmans were acting on
      behalf of the Post Office. To the best of my recollection, my relationship with
      Fujitsu Services was limited to dealing with witness statements and I do not
      recall any issues with that or having any particular view regarding their conduct
      of the proceedings.

17.   In response to the request to set out any additional relevant observations that I
      have concerning those involved in the litigation,           I cannot recall any
      observations I may or may not have had at the time. I do however recall that

                                                                                         WI TNO9420100
                                                                                     WI TN09420100




      those involved in the litigation at the Post Office were surprised and concerned
      by the Opinion expressed by Jason Coyne of Best Practice Group plc
      (Instructed pursuant to a Court Order) in his Report concerning the Horizon
      system (WITN00210101) which prompted Peter Sewell, Implementation Area
      Manager at the Post Office (WITN04600201) to ask Fujitsu Services to review
      the Report and provide their comments upon it. I cannot specifically recall
      which individuals at the Post Office were surprised and concerned by the
      Opinion of Jason Coyne and nor can I recall what aspects of it they were
      surprised about save to state that they were surprised about Jason Coyne's
      Opinion that the technology installed at Cleveleys Sub-Post Office was
      defective.

18.   I am asked what my reaction was to the result of the proceedings at the time.
      As previously stated, in paragraph 10 above, I cannot recall the specific terms
      of settlement which were agreed. To the best of my recollection, given the
      Opinion expressed by Jason Coyne in his Report, whilst Fujitsu Services
      provided its comments and response to the Report and Jan Holmes of Fujitsu
      Services provided a witness statement to be used in the proceedings
      (WlTN04600213). Based on the evidence available, it was considered by
      myself and Counsel that there were clear risks in proceeding with the claim
      against, Mrs Wolstenholme and defending the Counterclaim. The risks in
      proceeding were acknowledged and accepted by my primary contact at the
      Post Office and it was therefore agreed that attempts should be made to agree
      a resolution of the proceedings which is ultimately what occurred.

19.   The risks in proceeding with the claim and defence of Mrs Wolstenholme's
      Counterclaim are set out in some detail in the Advice on Quantum and Evidence
      (POL00118229). To the best of my recollection, whilst the risk that the Post
      Office would be unsuccessful in its claim and the risk that Mrs Wolstenholme
      would be successful in her Counterclaim had been identified prior to obtaining
      Counsel's Written Advice (POL00118229) and had prompted the payment into
      Court, given the fact that the Trial was fast approaching and my concerns
      regarding the risk of proceeding to Trial, I advised that a written Advice be
      obtained from Counsel on the evidence and quantum.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                WI TN09420100




20.     In response to the question concerning whether anyone at the Post Office or
        Fujitsu expressed any concern about bugs, errors or defects in Horizon, to the
        best of my recollection, the first time any issues concerning errors or defects
        came to light was in Mr Coyne's Report.

21.     I confirm that I have not had any subsequent involvement.


General — Questions

22,     I have been asked whether I was involved                                                                                                                                      any other challenges to the

        Horizon system other than the Woistenholme litigation. I have no recollection
        of being involved in any other challenges to the system.


23.     In response to the question as whether there are any other matters which I
        consider are of relevance to the Inquiry, I confirm that I am not aware of any
        such matters.
