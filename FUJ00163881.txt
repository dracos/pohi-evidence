Jonny,

1) Don’t think we can achieve this with a search, might only be achievable via manual examination which is just
too much work, but I’ve forwarded it on and see if anyone has any bright ideas.

2) SSC, yes a keyword search of KEL. SSC people tend to use more sophisticated searches than 2LS and hence
get less hits back to consider.

Steve,

Thank you for this — I will speak to the team about how we deploy this. Just to be clear, is the SSC looking at the
period where Mr Roll was working for the SSC or for the whole of Legacy Horizon (the search at para. 29 of your
second statement was originally described as covering the period that Mr Roll was working for the SSC and we
corrected it because it actually related to the whole of Legacy Horizon)?

There are a few more points that we should be grateful for your help with:-

* please would someone (John Simpkins?) be able to devise a search for and send us a list of:-

Oo Peaks/OCPs for evidence of RR carrying out "remote access" and send us a list of hits?

oO Peaks which show that SPMs reported issues said to have caused discrepancies of £250?
* when an incident comes in to the SSC, how to you find relevant KELs? Is it a keyword search or something
more complicated? What about first and second line — how do they search for relevant KELs?

Kind regards
Jonny

Jonny,

The SSC have been doing some more work to identify Peaks that show the SSC injecting transactions at the counter in
legacy Horizon during the period that Mr Roll was working for the SSC.

You will recall that for my second statement we were asked to identify what kind of issues would result in the SSC
injecting transactions at the counter. The information at para 29 in my second statement were obtained using the
search terms: "RiposteMessageFile", "RiposteMessage", "LPO Delete", "Marooned", "RiposteObject put". The
additional information below has been identified with additional search criteria devised when the original work came
under increased scrutiny recently. To find this additional information the SSC technician searched for all KELs that
mentioned the Riposte tools used to insert messages (RiposteMessageFile, Ripostelmport, RiposteMessage), collated
the KEL references, re-searched the Peak system for any Peaks which contained those KEL references and finally, read
through all the narrative of the Peaks identified by the new search criteria. This was very time consuming but has
revealed some new information:

Peaks Statement Ref

PCO105560, PC0106885 I SP2 29.3 2 additional examples of correcting configuration data after a PinPad
change.

PC0065796, PCO066061, I type, reference I of Ref Data that should be deleted. In these cases, the effect is that the

data issue Qty and Value of Stock items has got out of step. In order to fix this

problem it was agreed that transactions were inserted to effectively
Rem In the missing Qty, but have no impact on the actual value of the

FUJ00163881
FUJ00163881

stock items. Such inserts had to be done at the counter. These all
occurred in early 2001 and Peak PC0063599 indicates that the
underlying issue of not detecting a problem during rollover was fixed
in application version Cl4

PC0083998 (also cross None: Still a reference data issue but slightly different from the four above.
refers to PC0076029) In this case the issue is to do with Stock remaining for a withdrawn
product after the Reference data has been removed. I think one of the
“22 bugs” is related to this sort of scenario. Again there would have
been messages inserted (though I’m not sure if they could be done at
the CS rather than the counter) to address this issue. It isn’t clear from
the Peaks exactly what message were inserted. It may have just been
the missing reference data.

Note that both of these were picked up by SMC monitoring and not a
SPMR phoning in

It is important that we consider these as well since they expose a new kind of issue where it may be necessary for the
SSC to inject transactions at the counter, that of reference data problems. We believe that there will be more
examples of counter insertions that have not been identified yet but it is becoming increasingly difficult and time
consuming to identify others.

During the exercise SSC also identified three examples of the marooned transaction scenario described in SP2 38.2
(PCO068495, PC0099141, PCO0079196) which may be useful to us if we need to quote examples later
