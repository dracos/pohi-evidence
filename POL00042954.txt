Subject: FW: GLO Board Actions
Importance: High

Apologies — sent previous email too soon. Below are the actions on GLO arising out of GLO Board SubCommittee and
Board today.

Actions:

1. Board Subcommittee Actions are still outstanding:

a.
b.
c.

d.
e.

f.

Claimants’ perspective of quantum

Individual quantum analysis

Then what it likely takes to settle v losing in Court (there appeared to be divergence of view — I thought
the agreed view is that it would cost less to settle in Court v what it would take to settle it but there was
a challenge). It would be helpful to have an agreed position before Board.

Merits Opinion for UKGI / BEIS

Process/ protocol for UKGI/BEIS authorisation for settlement

Criminal Conviction category — likely quantum analysis (which would likely include sigma etc)

2. Operational Workstream Update (what was required to be changed, what has changed, and what is still to
change)

3. Horizon Contingency needs to update on what the Comms will be together with the solutions to foreseeable
outcomes (ie do we have the mobile vans in place; what would a different reconciliation statement look like; do
we know the liability / termination provisions of the Fujitsui contracts). A lot is on “process” rather than answers
/ solutions (I suspect that some of these are actually in Julie’s team so let’s join up there).

I query whether we need more litigation resource given the slowness of responding particularly with Shareholder
requests which should be actioned and delivered urgently. Can we please consider the HSF secondee.

Please ensure that these are delivered / escalated if necessary.

Thanks
Ben
