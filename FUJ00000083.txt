The decision of Post Office as to whether any person is to be refused admission to any
premises occupied by or on behalf of the Post Office Group or to a Branch shall be final
and conclusive.

FUJITSU SERVICES’ KEY PERSONNEL

The Parties acknowledge that the Key Personnel are essential to the fulfilment of Fujitsu
Services’ obligations hereunder.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Clause 50, Post Office shall keep the CCD
entitled “Fujitsu Services Key Personnel” (HR/CON/001) confidential in accordance with
the provision of Schedule 6.

Fujitsu Services undertakes to use all reasonable endeavours to ensure that the Key
Personnel are not removed or replaced for the duration of the activities relevant to them
(described as “Tasks” in the CCD entitled “Fujitsu Services Key Personnel”
(HR/CON/001). However, in the event that any of the Key Personne! become
unavailable for any reason (including without limitation death, injury, sickness,
promotion or resignation), Fujitsu Services shall have the right upon giving thirty (30)
days’ notice in writing (or such shorter period of notice as may be reasonably
practicable) to Post Office to replace such an individual with another individual whose
abilities and qualifications are appropriate for the services to be performed by such
individual.

The Parties acknowledge and agree that in order for Fujitsu Services to successfully
complete its obligations under this Agreement, additional key personnel may be
identified after the date of this Agreement. It shall be a responsibility of the Forums to
identify and agree any such additional key personnel (together with any activities which
are relevant to them).

LIQUIDATED DAMAGES AND POST OFFICE ADDITIONAL COST

In the event that the Services fail to meet the Service Levels contained in Schedule 15,
Fujitsu Services shall pay Post Office liquidated damages and Post Office Additional
Costs (such payment to be in the form of credit notes unless Post Office directs
otherwise) calculated or determined in accordance with Schedule 15 and paid pursuant
to Schedule 9.

Fujitsu Services shall pay Post Office the liquidated damages referred to in Clause 29.1
within thirty (30) days of the date on which Fujitsu Services is due to deliver the Service

Without prejudice to Clause 34.2 and paragraph 7 of Schedule 15:

29.4.1 liquidated damages payable in respect of any LDT failure (which is not an ARL
failure to which paragraph 2.5.2 applies), whether that LDT failure occurs at,
above or below the corresponding SLT, shall be Post Office's exclusive remedy
in respect of any failure of that LDT and/or SLT; and

29.4.2 Post Office's Additional Costs or liquidated damages payable in respect of any
ARL failure shall be Post Office's exclusive remedy in respect of that failure.

INJURY TO PERSONS; LOSS OF PROPERTY

Subject always to Post Office's proper observance of its obligations under this Clause,
Fujitsu Services shall fully indemnify Post Office in respect of any personal injury or loss
of or damage to Property incurred by Post Office, its contractors or their respective
employees and authorised agents to the extent that such personal injury or loss of
Property is caused by any Default of Fujitsu Services, its employees or agents in
connection with the performance or purported performance of this Agreement.

In the event of any claim or demand being made or action brought to which Clause 30.1
applies, Fujitsu Services shall be promptly notified thereof and Fujitsu Services shall at
its own expense conduct all negotiations for settlement of the same and any legal
proceedings that may arise therefrom. Fujitsu Services shall consult with and pay due
regard to the interests (including the commercial interests of the Post Office Group and
the public interest) and views of Post Office in the conduct of any defence to any claim
or demand hereunder, and shall, where it is reasonable to do so, comply with such
interests and views. Post Office, its employees and agents, shall at the request of
Fujitsu Services afford all reasonable assistance for the purpose of contesting any such
claim or demand or action and shall be repaid any reasonable expense incurred in so
doing and shall not make any admissions which may be prejudicial to the defence of
such claim or demand or action.

Notwithstanding Clause 30.2, Post Office shall have the option to take over the conduct
over any claim, demand or action to which this Clause applies. Should Post Office
exercise the aforementioned option it shall indemnify Fujitsu Services against any loss,
damage, cost or expense which it incurs in respect of that claim, demand or action over
and above the monetary amount (which Fujitsu Services shall have notified to Post
Office prior to Post Office exercising its option) at which Fujitsu Services was prepared
to settle said claim, demand or action.

Where Fujitsu Services is engaged under a series of related Work Orders
covering two or more of the following Development Process Stages:

32.2.5.1 Solution Specification Stage;
32.2.5.2 Solution Build and Test Stage; and
32.2.5.3 Implementation Stage,

the aggregate liability of Fujitsu Services for all Defaults (other than a Default

well as claims arising from defaults all claims for liquidated damages and Post Office
Additional Cost pursuant to Clause 29 and Schedule 15, all claims to be indemnified
pursuant to Clauses 18, 30 or 31 and all other claims or costs which are compensatable

Transfer Payment or any Termination Charges or NBS Termination Charges which may
become properly due and payable to Fujitsu Services in accordance with the provisions
hereof or any sum by way of interest thereon that a court may award.

Subject always to Clause 32.1, in no event shall any Party be liable to the other Party
for indirect or consequential loss or damage. For the avoidance of doubt, this Clause
shall not be deemed or construed to affect Fujitsu Services’ liability under Clause 31.

claim from Fujitsu Services for:

32.7.1 additional operational and administrative costs and expenses; and/or

32.7.2 expenditure or charges rendered unnecessary as a result of any Default by
Fujitsu Services.

The Parties expressly agree that should any limitation or provision contained in this
Clause be held to be invalid under any applicable statute or rule of law it shall to that
extent be deemed omitted but if any Party thereby becomes liable for loss or damage
which would otherwise have been excluded such liability shall be subject to the other
limitations and provisions set out herein.

For the avoidance of doubt, it is acknowledged that nothing in this Agreement shall be
deemed or construed to relieve either Party of its common law duty to the other Party
against which a claim may be made to mitigate any loss which is the subject of such
claim. In applying Fujitsu Services' common law and contractual obligations to mitigate
(whether for the purpose of calculating the Termination Payment or otherwise) no regard
shall be paid to the manner in which the Roll Out Payment is stated to be apportioned in
the definition of the term "Roll Out Payment" as it appeared in versions of this
Agreement prior to introduction of CCN 1100.

deemed to be £1,200,000 unless the Parties agree a different amount under a
CCN; and

POL FS Services Charge in that Financial Year, and that Financial Year only,
shall be deemed to be the aggregate of:

32.11.2.1 that proportion of the POL FS Services Charge amount stated in
Clause 32.11.1 immediately prior to such amendment as the number
of days in that Financial Year prior to the date of such amendment
bears to 365; and

32.11.2.2 that proportion of the POL FS Services Charge amount stated in
Clause 32.11.1 immediately following such amendment as the
number of days remaining in that Financial Year on and after the
date of such amendment bears to 365.

The liability of Fujitsu Services in connection with the SAP RTU is as set out in Clauses
32.10 and 32.11 and paragraph 22 of the SAP RTU. In the event and only to the extent
of any conflict between: (i) Clauses 32.10 and 32.11 and paragraph 22 of the SAP RTU;
and (ii) any other Clause, then Clauses 32.10 and 32.11 and paragraph 22 of the SAP.

events, omissions, happenings or non-happenings beyond its reasonable control
including (but without limiting the generality thereof) (i) Governmental Regulations
(subject to Clause 49.7), (ii) fire, (iii) flood, or (iv) any disaster or an industrial dispute
affecting a third party. Any act, event, omission, happening or non-happening will only
be considered Force Majeure if it is not attributable to the wilful act, neglect or failure to
take reasonable precautions of the affected Party, its agents or employees, and only if a
substitute third party is not reasonably available (having regard, without limitation, to the
cost and quality of such substitute) to perform the affected obligation. In no event shall

any fraudulent act or omission by any third party or Party in relation to the Services for
which Fujitsu Services is liable under Clause 31.1 constitute a force majeure event.

Neither Party hereto shall in any circumstances be liable to the other Party hereto for
any loss of any kind whatsoever including but not limited to any damages or abatement
of Charges whether directly or indirectly caused to or incurred by the other Party by
reason of any failure or delay in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement
which is due to Force Majeure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Party shall use all
reasonable endeavours to continue to perform, or resume performance of, such
obligations under this Agreement for the duration of such Force Majeure event. In the
case of Fujitsu Services, the Parties shall agree an orderly process for such
continuation or resumption of performance (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), and Fujitsu Services shall comply with such process. Fujitsu
Services shall remain liable to perform the Business Continuity Services, save where
such Business Continuity Services are themselves also affected by Force Majeure, in
which case Fujitsu Services shall be required to use all reasonable endeavours to
perform such Business Continuity Services.

If Fujitsu Services shall become aware of circumstances of Force Majeure which give
rise to or which are likely to give rise to any such failure or delay on its part it shall
forthwith notify Post Office within one (1) Working Day and shall inform Post Office of
the period which it is estimated that such failure or delay shall continue. If Post Office
shall become aware of circumstances of Force Majeure which give rise to any such
failure or delay on its part, it shall forthwith notify Fujitsu Services within one (1) Working
Day and shall inform Fujitsu Services of the period which it is estimated that such failure
or delay shall continue.

It is expressly agreed that any failure by Fujitsu Services to perform, or any delay by
Fujitsu Services in performing, its obligations under this Agreement which results from
any failure or delay in the performance of its obligations by any person, firm or company
with which Fujitsu Services shall have entered into any contract, supply arrangement or
sub-contract or otherwise shall be regarded as a failure or delay due to Force Majeure
only in the event that such person firm or company shall itself be prevented from or
delayed in complying with its obligations under such contract, supply arrangement or
sub-contract or otherwise as a result of circumstances of Force Majeure and there is no
substitute person, firm or company reasonably available (having regard, without
limitation, to the cost and quality of such substitute) to perform the affected obligation.

If any Force Majeure event prevents any Party from performing its obligations
hereunder for a period in excess of ninety (90) consecutive days, Post Office may after
consulting with Fujitsu Services and taking into account Fujitsu Services’ views,
terminate this Agreement in accordance with Clause 34.1.5.

Extension of Time

If the performance of this Agreement by either Party be delayed by reason of any Force
Majeure event (as defined in Clause 49.1), both Parties shall be entitled to a reasonable

extension of time subject to there being no entitlement to any additional costs or
expenses incurred as a result of the delay. The Party so delayed shall notify the other
Party in writing within one (1) Working Day of becoming aware of the Force Majeure
event.

Political Risk

Notwithstanding the provisions of Clauses 49.1 to 49.5, a change of, or new,
Governmental Regulation:

49.7.1 shall not entitle Post Office to terminate this Agreement under Clause 49.5, and
any such purported termination shall be treated as a termination for
convenience in accordance with Clause 34.6; and

49.7.2 shall not require Fujitsu Services to perform any additional obligations, or any
reduced or modified obligations resulting in increased cost to Fujitsu Services,
without its agreement in accordance with the Change Control Procedure.

CONFIDENTIALITY

Without prejudice to the application of the Official Secrets Acts 1911 to 1989 (where

relevant) to any Confidential Information Fujitsu Services acknowledges that any

Confidential Information (other than its own Confidential Information) obtained from or

relating to Post Office, or its servants or agents, is the property of Post Office.

Each Party agrees to keep confidential, and not to disclose to anyone else, Confidential
Information.

Notwithstanding the above, any Party may disclose Confidential Information:
50.2.1 if and to the extent required by law;

50.2.2 if and to the extent that the other Party has given prior written consent to the
disclosure;

50.2.3 to its professional advisers;

50.2.4 to the extent requested by H.M. Government;

50.2.5 if and to the extent that the Confidential Information is in the public domain or
falls into the public domain without breach of any applicable confidentiality
obligation (including this clause);

50.2.6 to Royal Mail Group;

50.2.7 to Fujitsu Services Holdings Plc, Fujitsu Services Limited or its Parent

Fujitsu Services;

50.2.11 which is in the possession of the receiving Party without restriction in relation to
disclosure before the date of receipt from the disclosing Party;

obligation restricting its disclosure;

50.2.13which is independently developed without access to the Confidential
Information; and

50.2.14 as may be required under the FOIA or the EIR, in respect of which paragraph
2.9 of schedule 2 shall apply.

From the earlier of 1 October 2008 and the date on which Post Office serves notice on
Fujitsu Services of its intention to terminate this Agreement, Post Office shall be entitled
to disclose Confidential Information to bona fide potential Next Suppliers of the Services
to the extent that such disclosure is reasonably required to enable any potential Next
Supplier to prepare a reasonably detailed tender proposal to Post Office in relation to
the provision of services equivalent to the Services. Post Office shall ensure that prior
to any Confidential Information being disclosed to any such potential Next Supplier,
such potential Next Supplier shall enter into an Agreed Form NDA and shall immediately
inform Fujitsu Services if it has reason to believe that the potential Next Supplier is in
breach of the undertakings contained in that confidentiality agreement.

The Parties hereby agree that (other than as required by law):

50.4.1 each Party (and any person employed or engaged by it in connection with this
Agreement in the course of such employment or engagement) shall only use
Confidential Information of the other Party for the purposes of this Agreement;

50.4.2 each Party receiving Confidential Information from the other Party shall take all
necessary precautions to ensure that no Confidential Information of the other
Party is used other than for the purposes of this Agreement by the receiving
Party's employees, servants, agents or sub-contractors including, without
limitation, obtaining from any such agent or sub-contractor a signed
confidentiality undertaking on substantially the same terms as are contained in
this Clause; and

50.4.3.1 neither Fujitsu Services nor any person engaged by Fujitsu Services
(whether as a servant or a consultant or otherwise) shall use the
Confidential Information of Post Office for the solicitation of business
from any third party or away from Post Office; and

50.4.3.2 Post Office may discharge the obligation imposed on it by Clause
50.4.2 to obtain signed confidentiality undertakings, in so far as such
Clause relates to individuals who are provided to the Post Office to
perform the tasks of Post Office employees under a framework
resource agreement (“Framework Agreement’) with a third party
(such individuals being referred to in this Clause as “Contractors”) by
including within such Framework Agreement:

(i) an obligation of confidentiality in respect of Fujitsu Services’
Confidential Information which shall be binding on such third
party and each Contractor and continue in effect until at least
three years after the Framework Agreement is terminated or
expires; and

(ii) a provision requiring all of Fujitsu Services’ Confidential
Information held by each Contractor in tangible form to be
returned to the Post Office, and all such information held in
electronic form to be irretrievably deleted or destroyed, on
termination or expiry of that Contractor's assignment.

[Not used]

In the event that Confidential Information is disclosed by any Party to its professional
advisers, that Party shall procure that its professional advisers comply with the
restrictions contained in this Clause, mutatis mutandis.

Nothing in this Clause 50 shall prevent Fujitsu Services or Post Office from using data-
processing techniques, ideas and know-how gained during the performance of this
Agreement in the furtherance of its normal business, to the extent that this does not
relate to a disclosure of Confidential Information or an infringement by Post Office or
Fujitsu Services of any Intellectual Property Right.

REMEDIES CUMULATIVE

Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, all remedies available to
Fujitsu Services or to Post Office for breach of this Agreement are cumulative and may
be exercised concurrently or separately and the exercise of any one remedy shall not
be deemed an election of such remedy to the exclusion of other remedies.

2.4.10.3 Fujitsu Services shall assess and notify Post Office which of the Subject
Information Requests notified to it by Post Office (other than those within the
Response Capability in accordance with paragraph 2.4.10.1 above) can be
responded to within the Response Capability and those in relation to which
Fujitsu Services’ ability to respond is outside the Response Capability.

2.4.10.4 If Fujitsu Services’ ability to respond to a Subject Information Request is within
the Response Capability, Fujitsu Services shall, subject to Fujitsu Services’
current and expected future workload for dealing with both Audit Record
Queries and Subject Information Requests remaining the same or decreasing,
respond to that request within the applicable time limit.

2.4.10.5 Subject to paragraph 2.4.10.6, if Fujitsu Services’ ability to respond to a

Services shall notify Post Office how long it would take to respond to that
Subject Information Request, and shall (subject to Fujitsu Services’ current and
expected future workload for dealing with both Audit Record Queries and
Subject Information Requests remaining the same or decreasing) respond to
that request within Fujitsu Services’ estimated response time plus 10% of that
time.

2.4.10.6 If Fujitsu Services’ ability to respond to a Subject Information Request is
outside the Response Capability and Fujitsu Services reasonably believes that
at its current workload it may never be able to respond to that request, it shall
notify Post Office of that fact and Post Office may nevertheless request Fujitsu
Services to respond to that request as soon as reasonably practicable. Post
Office acknowledges and agrees that for so long as Fujitsu Services’ ability to
respond to such requests remains outside the Response Capability, Fujitsu
Services will not be able to respond to them.

2.4.10.7 Unless agreed otherwise, Fujitsu Services’ response to each Subject
Information Request shall be in the form of an Excel (or other equivalent
product) spreadsheet and shall be provided to Post Office (or the relevant Data
Controller) on CD ROM.

2.4.10.8 Fujitsu Services shall seek to accommodate the priorities (of which it is
notified) of Post Office for Subject Information Requests to be responded to in a
particular order. Post Office agrees that if by accommodating such priorities,
Fujitsu Services would be unable to achieve a time limit for a Subject
Information Request to which Fujitsu Services is responding or is required to
respond, that time limit shall not be applicable and (unless otherwise agreed)
Fujitsu Services shall respond to such request as soon as reasonably
practicable.

(b) any such investment shall be the subject of a CCN and shall
not be undertaken by Fujitsu Services without Post Office's
prior agreement.

2.4.11 In respect of any Subject Information Requests to which paragraph 2.4.10
above does not apply, Fujitsu Services shall respond to those requests as soon
as reasonably practicable taking into account the time limits notified to Fujitsu
Services for those requests and the technical limitations of any systems used to
source the information requested.

Fujitsu Services acknowledges that Post Office is subject to legal duties which may
require the release of information under FOIA and/or EIR and that Post Office may be
under an obligation to provide information on request. Such information may include
Confidential Information.

In the event that Post Office receives a valid request for information under FOIA and/or
EIR to disclose Confidential Information (in whatever form), Post Office shall as soon as
reasonably practicable after receiving that request notify Fujitsu Services and the

Parties shall consider whether (i) the FOIA exemption in relation to confidentiality under

section 41 FOIA or any other exemption under FOIA or EIR applies in relation to that
request and (ii) there is a duty to confirm or deny that the Confidential Information in
question is held by Post Office.

Post Office shall not, subject to paragraph 2.9.7:

2.9.3.1 if and to the extent the Parties agree that paragraph 2.9.2 (i) applies in respect
of any request, disclose the Confidential Information requested; and

2.9.3.2 if and to the extent the Parties agree that paragraph 2.9.2 (ii) does not apply in
respect of any request, confirm or deny that the Confidential Information in

Information in question is held by Post Office and/or (ii) the FOIA exemption in relation
to confidentiality under section 41 FOIA or any other exemption under FOIA or EIR
applies in relation to the valid request as soon as reasonably practicable within the time

(‘FOIA Order’).

On request from Fujitsu Services, Post Office shall bring to the Information Tribunal or
to such other courts and tribunals (having jurisdiction) as Fujitsu Services may
reasonably require, such actions and appeals against the disclosure of Confidential
Information under FOIA as Fujitsu may reasonably require, except where:

2.9.6.1 Post Office reasonably considers that to bring or continue such an action or
appeal would be materially detrimental to its public reputation and this materially
outweighs any damage to Fujitsu Services’ commercial interests which would
arise as a result of such disclosure; or

2.9.6.2 Post Office has received a written opinion from legal counsel experienced in
FOIA related matters (a copy of such opinion to be provided, for information
only without reliance, to Fujitsu Services upon request) that such an action or
appeal has no reasonable prospect of success.

Nothing in this Agreement (including in this paragraph 2.9) shall prevent Post Office
from complying with any valid FOIA Order when required to do so by law provided that:

the use of mediation or expert determination, the courts of England.

The Parties may relax the timescales referred to in the DRP by mutual agreement (such
agreement not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

FORUM REVIEW

As soon as either Party becomes aware of a disputed matter it shall refer the Dispute to
the Forum (other than the Executive Forum) best qualified to deal with the Dispute
(taking into account the nature of the Dispute and the responsibilities of each Forum) for
discussion at the next meeting of that Forum (or earlier in accordance with paragraph
1.1.10 of Schedule 4). If the Dispute relates to the interpretation of this Agreement
(including its Schedules and CCDs) or to the amount or terms of invoices, then the
Dispute shall be referred to the Commercial Forum for resolution.

NEGOTIATORS REVIEW

In the event that the Forum to which a dispute is referred under paragraph 2.1 of this
Annex fails to resolve that Dispute, each Party shall within 10 Working Days of such
failure provide the other with a Statement of Dispute (as defined in paragraph 5 below).
If the Parties agree to do so, such statements may be provided sequentially by one
Party responding to the Statement of Dispute of the other.

Each Party shall appoint, within five Working Days of receiving the Notification of
Dispute, a suitably empowered senior representative with appropriate operational
experience or client responsibility to act as negotiator on the Dispute (the "Negotiator").
Each Party shall ensure that its appointed Negotiator is of an appropriate level within its
organisation so as to enable the Negotiator to progress the resolution of the Dispute.

The Negotiators will be responsible for collating all relevant information relating to the
Dispute and for progressing the Dispute through the DRP until it is resolved or
determined.

Each Party's Negotiator shall, within five Working Days of his appointment, meet with
the other Party's Negotiator with the object of resolving the Dispute by way of good faith
negotiation (the "Negotiator's Review").

Each Party shall attempt, through its Negotiator, to resolve the Dispute by way of good
faith negotiation.

EXECUTIVE REVIEW

If the Dispute is not resolved by the Negotiator’s Review, either Party may, at its
discretion and no earlier than five Working Days after the Negotiator's Review or the
date by which the Negotiators Review should have taken place (whichever is the
earlier), refer the Dispute for review (the "Executive Review") by appropriate members
of the Executive Forum nominated by each of the Parties within 3 Working Days of the
referral (the “Nominated Executives”).

The Executive Review shall take place within 5 Working Days of the referral with the
object of resolving the Dispute by way of good faith negotiation.

The Parties may agree, before the Executive Review referred to in paragraph 4.2 of this
Annex takes place, or if that review fails to resolve the Dispute referred to it, to appoint
an expert facilitator (the “Facilitator”) to assist with resolution of the Dispute on the
following bases:

4.3.1 The Facilitator will be appointed as soon as reasonably practicable.
4.3.2 The Facilitator shall be an individual who:

4.3.2.1 holds qualifications in respect of the subject matter underlying the
Dispute; and

4.3.2.2 is approved by both Parties (such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed).

4.3.3 In the event that the Parties fail to agree upon the Facilitator to be appointed,
the Facilitator shall be appointed at the request of Post Office or Fujitsu
Services by the President for the time being of the Institute of Electrical
Engineers so long as such appointee shall meet the criteria in paragraph 4.3.2
above.

to the Facilitator:

4.3.5.1 each Party's Statement of Dispute (as amended to reflect matters
discussed at previous Stages and as disclosed to the other Party); and

4.3.5.2 a joint agreed statement describing the scope of the initial guidance
required from the Facilitator.

4.3.6 The Dispute shall be referred to the Facilitator to obtain such initial guidance.
The Facilitator shall not be required to determine the Dispute unless the Parties
agree that he shall be appointed as an Expert in accordance with paragraph 7
of this Annex.

Once the Facilitator has given to the Parties his initial guidance on the Dispute, the
Nominated Executives shall meet and attempt to resolve the Dispute with the advice
and guidance of the Facilitator.

If the Dispute is not resolved by the Executive Review the Parties may, if both Parties
agree, refer the Dispute to mediation or expert determination.

If the Parties do not reach agreement on whether to (a) seek initial guidance from an
expert facilitator (in accordance with paragraph 4.3 of this Annex) or (b) proceed to
mediation or expert determination (in accordance with paragraph 4.5 of this Annex), in
each case within 10 Working Days of completing the Executive Review referred to in
paragraph 4.2 of this Annex, either Party may refer the Dispute to the courts of England.
Notwithstanding the requirement in paragraph 4.2, if the Executive Review has not
taken place within 20 Working Days of referral, either Party may refer the Dispute to the
courts of England.

A “Statement of Dispute” means a dated statement containing the following information:
5.1.1. aunique serial number to be provided by the Commercial Forum;

referred to mediation. In the event that the Parties agree to mediation, the Parties will be
responsible for appointing the mediator (the "Mediator"), but in the event that they are
unable to agree on a Mediator either or both of the Parties shall request the Centre for
Dispute Resolution ("CEDR") to appoint a Mediator.

The Parties shall, with the assistance of the Mediator, seek to agree the mediation
procedure. In default of such agreement, the Mediator shall act in accordance with
CEDR rules. The Parties shall, within five Working Days of the date on which the terms
of the mediation are settled, meet the Mediator in order to agree a programme for the
exchange of any relevant information and the structure to be adopted for the mediation.

Subject to agreement between the Parties, the mediation shall take place within 30
Working Days of the appointment of the Mediator.

individual who:

7.2.1 holds qualifications in respect of the subject matter underlying the Dispute in
question; and

Change Control Procedure save that any prices in a CCD may only be changed
through the Hard Change Control Procedure unless such change is being made
to implement changes agreed under the Hard Change Control Procedure in
accordance with the provisions of Schedule 10.

Anew CCD or CRD shall only be created in accordance with the Hard Change Control
Procedure. For the avoidance of doubt, any such new CCD or CRD shall only be added
to the CCD entitled “Contract Controlled and Referenced Document List” (BP/SPE/026)
and, subject to paragraph 2.7, delegated to an Owning Forum in accordance with the
Hard Change Control Procedure.

Where a change is being made in accordance with the Hard Change Control Procedure
and in connection therewith a change to a CCD is necessary, such change may be
made through the Hard Change Control Procedure. In addition, a Forum may elect to
change a CCD through the Hard Change Control Procedure.

Within the context of the following sections of this Schedule the term "change" includes
both amendments and changes.

An existing CRD may be amended by the Party which owns that CRD. The new version
of an amended CRD shall become effective on delivery to the other Party's Lead
Attendee of the Owning Forum.

PRINCIPLES

Where Post Office or Fujitsu Services identifies the need for a change, then Post Office
may at any time request a change or Fujitsu Services may at any time recommend a
change. Such a request or recommendation shall only be made and shall only be valid if
authorised (in each case) in accordance with the procedures set out in paragraph 3 or 4
(as relevant) of this Schedule.

Neither Post Office nor Fujitsu Services shall unreasonably withhold or delay their
agreement to any change or proposal in relation thereto.

Until such time as a change has been fully authorised in accordance with the
procedures set out in paragraph 3 or 4 (as relevant) of this Schedule, Post Office and
Fujitsu Services shall continue as if the change had not been made.

Any discussions which may take place between Post Office and Fujitsu Services on a
change before its authorisation shall be without prejudice to the rights of either Party.

Any purported change provided by Fujitsu Services that has not been otherwise agreed
in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2.1 above shall be undertaken entirely at
the expense and liability of Fujitsu Services. If so required by Post Office, Fujitsu
Services shall at its own expense promptly take all steps necessary to reverse and
remove the effects of such purported change.

Except as described in paragraphs 1.1.2, 1.1.3 and 1.3 of this Schedule, any change to
a CCD shall be agreed by the Forum to which the CCD has been delegated (such
Forum being, once delegated, the “Owning Forum”). Except as provided for by

paragraph 2.7 below, such delegations shall be made in accordance with the Hard
Change Control Procedure and shall be identified in the column headed "Owning
Forum" in the CCD entitled “Contract Controlled and Referenced Document List”
(BP/SPE/026) (which shall list all CCDs and CRDs in existence from time to time).

Any CCD and CRD which is not delegated to an Owning Forum or for which its Owning
Forum ceases to exist shall be deemed to have been delegated to the Commercial
Forum. In such circumstances, the Commercial Forum shall be entitled to delegate
another Forum as the Owning Forum using the Soft Change Control Procedure and
require that the CCD entitled “Contract Controlled and Referenced Document List”
(BP/SPE/026) be amended accordingly.

SOFT CHANGE CONTROL PROCEDURE
In relation to each CCD delegated to an Owning Forum:

3.1.1. Post Office Lead Attendee of that Forum shall nominate a person, by function
but not by name, who shall act as change approval authority for Post Office
("Post Office Approval Authority"); and

3.1.2 Fujitsu Services Lead Attendee of that Forum shall nominate a person, by
function but not by name, who shall act as change approval authority for Fujitsu
Services ("Fujitsu Services Approval Authority").

Each of the nominations referred to in this paragraph 3.1 shall be identified in the CCD
entitled “Contract Controlled and Referenced Document List” (BP/SPE/026).

A new version of a CCD shall only be authorised and become effective if it shall have
been signed by both Fujitsu Services Approval Authority on behalf of Fujitsu Services
and Post Office Approval Authority on behalf of Post Office.

If Post Office Approval Authority is not available (for example because of absence, job
vacancy or re-organisation) then the Post Office Lead Attendee of that Forum shall act
as the Post Office Approval Authority or shall nominate a replacement Post Office
Approval Authority. If a permanent replacement is nominated, the Post Office Lead
Attendee shall inform Fujitsu Services in writing and procure that the CCD entitled
“Contract Controlled and Referenced Document List” (BP/SPE/026) is amended
accordingly.

If Fujitsu Services Approval Authority is not available (for example because of absence,
job vacancy or re-organisation) then the Fujitsu Services Lead Attendee of that Forum
shall act as the Fujitsu Services Approval Authority or shall nominate a replacement
Fujitsu Services Approval Authority. If a permanent replacement is nominated, the
Fujitsu Services Lead Attendee shall inform Post Office in writing and procure that the
CCD entitled “Contract Controlled and Referenced Document List” (BP/SPE/026) is
amended accordingly.

To the extent that Post Office requests, or a Work Order commissioned by Post Office
necessitates (and Fujitsu Services identifies the same at that time), the preparation and
drafting of a new CCD or the amendment of an existing CCD (to the extent not carried

out by resources paid for under the Operational Charges), Post Office shall approve the
cost of such preparation or amendment through the Work Ordering Procedure
described in Schedule 9.

HARD CHANGE CONTROL PROCEDURE

Standard Change Procedures

4.1.41

Discussions between Post Office and Fujitsu Services in relation to a change to
be effected through the Hard Change Control Procedure shall result in any one
of the following:

4.1.1.1 no further action;

4.1.1.2 a request to make a change by Post Office's authorised representative
(a "Change Request");

4.1.1.3 a recommendation to make a change by Fujitsu Services.

Post Office shall send Change Requests to Fujitsu Services Change Control
Manager. Where Fujitsu Services receives a Change Request Fujitsu Services
shall unless otherwise agreed submit electronically to the Post Office Change
Control Manager a Change Control Note (“CCN”) within three (3) weeks of the
date of receipt of such Change Request.

If Fujitsu Services considers that the preparation of a CCN, requested by Post
Office, would necessitate allocation of resources in excess of five (5) mandays,
Fujitsu Services shall notify Post Office accordingly and, on agreement by Post
Office, Fujitsu Services will make a proposal for a paid study of the cost and
implications of producing the required CCN. Pending Post Office's acceptance
of that proposal or in the event that Post Office does not agree that such
proposal should be submitted, Fujitsu Services will be relieved of its obligations
to produce such CCN.

A recommendation to make a change by Fujitsu Services shall be submitted
electronically to the Post Office Change Control Manager in the form of a CCN.

For each CCN submitted, Post Office shall evaluate the CCN and, as
appropriate, during the period of validity:

4.1.5.1 request further information;

4.1.5.2 authorise the change set out in the CCN in accordance with paragraph
4.1.7 below;

4.1.5.3 suggest modifications to the CCN (including, without limitation,
corrections of minor errors to avoid unnecessary rejection); or

4.1.5.4 notify Fujitsu Services of its rejection (together with an explanation of
the rejection) of the CCN.

4.2

The period of validity of each CCN shall be the period from the date on which
that CCN shall have been submitted to the Post Office Change Control
Manager until the date of expiry of that CCN (as specified in that CCN and
normally no earlier than three weeks after submission of CCN to Post Office) or
such other date as the Parties may agree.

In connection with CCNs submitted electronically, Fujitsu Services shall on the
date of submission send to the Post Office Change Control Manager two copies
of the CCN signed on behalf of Fujitsu Services by one of the following: Director
Commercial and Finance; Director Business Development; or Business Unit
Manager.

Achange shall only be authorised if the CCN relating thereto has been signed
by one of Director Commercial and Finance, Director Business Development
and Business Unit Director on behalf of Fujitsu Services and one of Purchasing
Services Commercial Manager and Director Purchasing Services on behalf of
Post Office.

Emergency Change Procedures

4.2.1

4.2.2

Emergency situations resulting in Post Office requesting a change, or Fujitsu
Services recommending a change, shall be dealt with on a case by case basis
by one of Director Commercial and Finance, Director Business Development
and Business Unit Manager on behalf of Fujitsu Services and one of Purchasing
Services Commercial Manager and Director Purchasing Services on behalf of
Post Office who shall jointly decide in writing whether or not to authorise such
change in accordance with this paragraph 4.2.

Where a change is authorised pursuant to paragraph 4.2.1 above:

4.2.2.1 the CCN relating thereto need not comply with paragraphs 4.1.1 to
4.1.7 above inclusive;

4.2.2.2 such change shall, before it may be authorised, be set out in a CCN in
the form, and containing the information indicated in the CCD entitled “
Fujitsu Services Change Control Note” (PA/TEM/007) save that rather
than setting out:

facilities) an outline of the change shall be sufficient;

(b) a statement of the impact, if any, of the change on other aspects
of this Agreement or Services, an outline of the impact shall be
sufficient; and

(c) proposed revised wording to this Agreement, direct (as distinct
from consequential) revised wording to this Agreement shall be
sufficient.

EMERGENCY PROCEDURES.

If Fujitsu Services considers that any change is necessary in order for it to comply with
its obligations under this Agreement and there is insufficient time to comply with the
procedures described above, Fujitsu Services shall be entitled to proceed with such
change, provided that it shall as soon as practicable provide Post Office with a CCN for
retrospective change. Such change shall be subject to the procedures described in this
Schedule, and if Post Office, acting reasonably, does not agree to such change, such
change shall be invalid and Fujitsu Services shall at its own expense promptly take all
steps necessary to reverse and remove the effects of such change.

2.2.4.3 any changes required to this Agreement.

Fujitsu Services shall not be liable for any failure to achieve the NBS Service

Agreement including without limitation in relation to the Services,

The occurrence of an Insolvency Event of Energis shall not of itself entitle
Fujitsu Services to increase its Charges in respect of the Services other than
the NBS.

BETWEEN

(1) FUJITSU SERVICES HOLDINGS PLC whose registered office is at 26 Finsbury
Square, London EC2A 1SL (registered in England and Wales under company
number 00142200) (the “Guarantor”) in favour of

(2) POST OFFICE LIMITED whose registered office is situated at 80-86 Old Street,
London, EC1V 9NN (registered in England and Wales under company number
02154540) (the “Post Office”, which expression includes Post Office's successors
and assigns).

WHEREAS,

(A) On 28 July 1999 a codified agreement (the “Original Codified Agreement”) was
entered into between Post Office (formerly Post Office Counters Limited) and Fujitsu
Services (Pathway) Limited (formerly ICL Pathway Limited) (“Pathway”).

(B) Supplemental to the Original Codified Agreement, on 3 August 1999, the Guarantor
entered into a Deed of Guarantee with Post Office, and by a letter to Post Office
dated 11 July 2002 the Guarantor confirmed that the terms of that guarantee would
continue in full force and effect in relation to the Original Codified Agreement as
amended by the Network Banking CCN referred to in that letter (that guarantee and
letter together, the “First Guarantee”).

(C) By a change control notice, number 1100, dated 31% December 2002 (the
“Amendment CCN”) Post Office and Pathway agreed to vary and restate the terms of
the Original Codified Agreement (the Original Codified Agreement as varied and
restated by the Amendment CCN being referred to herein as the “Agreement”).

(D) Pathway and Post Office intend that the Agreement will be novated by the
assignment of Pathway’s rights and obligations thereunder to Fujitsu Services Limited
(registered in England and Wales under company number 00096056) by a Novation
Agreement (the “Novation Agreement’) to be entered into by Pathway, Post Office
and Fujitsu Services Limited on or around 1 April 2003. Upon the Novation
Agreement being entered into all references to the “Agreement” in this Deed of
Guarantee will thereafter be read and construed as references to the Agreement as
modified by the Novation Agreement and references to the obligations of the Principal
Obligors under the Agreement will be to those obligations as modified, assumed or
released by the Novation Agreement.

SCHEDULE 8

CONFIDENTIAL

(E)

(F)

(G)

In this Deed of Guarantee “Principal Obligors” means Pathway and Fujitsu Services
Limited.

The services to be provided by the Principal Obligors to Post Office under the
Agreement are critical to the accomplishment of the statutory functions and business
objectives of Post Office.

Post Office would not have entered into the Amendment CCN without a satisfactory
guarantee being provided by the Guarantor of the Principal Obligor's obligations and
liabilities thereunder.

The Guarantor and Post Office now wish to discharge the First Guarantee and enter
into a new guarantee between themselves on the terms hereinafter appearing.

NOW THIS DEED WITNESSES AS FOLLOWS:-

With effect from the execution of this Deed of Guarantee Post Office unconditionally
and irrevocably releases the Guarantor from the First Guarantee and each and any
obligation which the Guarantor has or may have under the First Guarantee, the First
Guarantee shall be treated for all purposes as discharged, and Post Office agrees to
deliver up the First Guarantee to the Guarantor forthwith.

2. If either of the Principal Obligors fails fully and punctually to perform its obligations
under the Agreement or commits any breach of its obligations under the Agreement
which is not remedied in accordance therewith, the Guarantor unconditionally
undertakes that upon demand by Post Office in accordance with Clause 4 hereof it
shall:

24 subject to all limitations on the liability of the Principal Obligors contained in
the Agreement, indemnify and maintain Post Office indemnified against all
losses, damages, costs and expenses (including court costs and legal fees
on a solicitor and own client basis) which may be incurred by Post Office
arising out of all and any such failures or breaches, but only to the extent
that either of the Principal Obligors are liable for the same under the
Agreement;

2.2 as a separate and independent obligation and as primary obligor, be
responsible for and hereby guarantees to Post Office the due performance
by the Principal Obligors of their obligations under the Agreement; and

2.3 as a separate and independent obligation and as primary obligor, fully,
punctually and specifically perform those obligations under the Agreement
which are not performed as a result of the Default (as defined in the
Agreement) of either of the Principal Obligors thereunder. The Guarantor
shall perform, fulfil and observe all terms, warranties and representations in
the Agreement which are not performed as a result of the Default of the

SCHEDULE 8

Principal Obligors thereunder as if the Agreement was directly entered into
by the Guarantor and Post Office,

PROVIDED THAT in no event shall the liability of the Guarantor to Post Office
hereunder be greater than the liability of the Principal Obligors to Post Office under
the Agreement, and provided further that any limitation on the liability of, and any
defences available to, the Principal Obligors under the Agreement shall be available
to the Guarantor hereunder. Notwithstanding the date of this Deed of Guarantee the
Guarantor's obligations hereunder shall extend to all breaches of the Agreement by
the Principal Obligors whensoever or howsoever any breach occurred whether
before, on, or after the date of this Deed of Guarantee and the Guarantor agrees that
Post Office shall have the right to enforce this Deed of Guarantee and pursue any
claims and demands arising out of or in respect thereof whether arising prior to, on,
or subsequent to the date of this Deed of Guarantee.

Post Office shall have no greater rights under this Deed of Guarantee in relation to
the Principal Obligors’ obligations under the Agreement than it has under the
Agreement.

Any demand under this Deed of Guarantee shall be in writing, addressed to the
registered office of the Guarantor (or such other address as the Guarantor has from
time to time notified to Post Office as being an address for the receipt of such
demands) and accompanied by a statement identifying the nature of the claim by
Post Office, and shall be copied to the Principal Obligors at their respective registered
offices

The Guarantor shall not be discharged or released from this Deed of Guarantee by
any arrangement made between any Principal Obligor and Post Office without the
assent of the Guarantor or by any amendment to or termination of the Agreement or
by any forbearance or indulgence whether as to payment, time, performance or
otherwise granted by Post Office in relation thereto.

The obligations of the Guarantor under this Deed of Guarantee may not be assigned
or subcontracted in whole or in part without the express written authority of Post
Office. For the avoidance of doubt, and without prejudice to the generality of the
foregoing provisions of this Clause 5.2, the obligations of the Guarantor under
Clauses 2.2 and 2.3 hereof may be sub-contracted if agreed in accordance with this
Clause 5.2.

This Deed of Guarantee shall be a continuing security and accordingly it shall:
6.1 not be discharged by any partial performance (except to the extent of such
partial performance) by any Principal Obligor of its obligations under the

Agreement, and

6.2 extend to cover the unperformed part of the obligations of any Principal
Obligor from time to time under the Agreement.

12.

The obligations of the Guarantor under this Deed of Guarantee are those of primary
obligor and such obligations exist irrespective of any total or partial invalidity, illegality
or unenforceability of the Agreement. Post Office shall not be obliged before taking
steps to enforce this Deed of Guarantee against the Guarantor to obtain judgment
against any Principal Obligor or the Guarantor or any third party in any Court, or to
make or file any claim in a bankruptcy or liquidation of any Principal Obligor or any
third party, or to take any action whatsoever against any Principal Obligor or the
Guarantor or any third party (other than serving a copy of the notice of demand upon
the Principal Obligors in accordance with Clause 4 above).

The Guarantor warrants that it is a company duly organised and validly existing under
the laws of England with limited liability and has all power and authority to enter into
and perform the obligations contemplated by this Deed of Guarantee to be performed
by it and that this Deed of Guarantee constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation.

All sums payable by the Guarantor under this Deed of Guarantee shall be paid
without any set-off, lien or counterclaim, deduction or withholding, howsoever arising.

None of the liabilities or obligations of the Guarantor under this Deed of Guarantee
shall be impaired or discharged by the winding up, amalgamation, reconstruction or
reorganisation of the Guarantor or any Principal Obligor (or the commencement of
any of the foregoing).

If any provision of this Deed of Guarantee is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable for
any reason by any Court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall be severed
and the remainder of the provisions hereof shall continue in full force and effect as if
this Deed of Guarantee had been executed with the invalid, illegal or unenforceable
provision eliminated

This Deed of Guarantee shall be governed by and construed in all respects in
accordance with the laws of England and the parties hereby submit to the non-
exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts of England in respect of any dispute which may
arise between the parties concerning this Deed of Guarantee.

In the event that there shall, in the reasonable opinion of Post Office, occur a material
adverse change in the financial condition of the Guarantor by comparison with such a
financial condition as at the date of this Deed of Guarantee, which change in financial
condition could reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on the ability of the
Guarantor to perform its obligations under this Deed of Guarantee, then the
Guarantor shall, if so required by Post Office in writing, procure that there is provided
to Post Office an Acceptable Additional Guarantee. Such an Acceptable Additional
Guarantee shall be provided within one (1) month after Post Office requires the
provision of the same. For the purposes of this Clause, an “Acceptable Additional
Guarantee” shall be a guarantee of the obligations of the Guarantor under this Deed
of Guarantee given in favour of Post Office which:

13.1.1 is given by an entity acceptable to Post Office which has a financial condition
at least as good as that of the Guarantor as at the date of this Deed of
Guarantee; and

SCHEDULE 8
Page 7 of 18

FUJ00000083

CONFIDENTIAL

13.1.2 is substantially in the form of this Deed of Guarantee with such amendments
as Post Office shall reasonably require to take account of the identity and
place of incorporation of, and any other factors relevant to, the new
guarantor.

Any such Acceptable Additional Guarantee shall be in addition to and not in
substitution for this Deed of Guarantee.

In the event that there shall, in the reasonable opinion of Post Office, occur a material
adverse change in the financial condition of any person liable as guarantor under an
Acceptable Additional Guarantee by comparison with such financial condition as at
the date of the relevant Acceptable Additional Guarantee, which change in financial
condition could reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on the ability of the
relevant party to perform its obligations under the applicable Acceptable Additional
Guarantee, then the Guarantor shall, if so required by Post Office in writing, procure
that there is provided to Post Office a further Acceptable Additional Guarantee from
another entity. Any such Acceptable Additional Guarantee shall be provided within
one (1) month after Post Office requires the provision of the same.

Any failure by the Guarantor to provide an Acceptable Additional Guarantee in
accordance with the provisions of this Clause shall be treated as a Default by the
Principal Obligors entitling Post Office to terminate the Agreement pursuant to Clause
34.2 thereof.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF the Guarantor has executed this document as a Deed the day and
year first before written.

BETWEEN

(1) FUJITSU LIMITED of 1-1, Kamikodanaka 4-chome, Nakahara-ku, Kawasaki 211-

AND

(2) POST OFFICE LIMITED whose registered office is at 80-86 Old Street, London,
EC1V 9NN (registered in England and Wales under company number 02154540)
("Post Office", which expression includes Post Office's successors and assigns).

WHEREAS

(A) On 28 July 1999 a codified agreement (the “Original Codified Agreement’) was
entered into between Post Office (formerly Post Office Counters Limited) and Fujitsu
Services (Pathway) Limited (formerly ICL Pathway Limited) (“Pathway”).

(B) The Guarantor, on the execution of the Original Codified Agreement, executed a
guarantee dated 28 July 1999 in the terms stated therein in respect of the Original
Codified Agreement.

(C) By a letter from Hiroaki Kurokawa of Fujitsu Limited to Post Office it was stated that
the guarantee dated 28 July 1999 referred to in Recital (B) would continue in full
force and effect in relation to the Original Codified Agreement and the obligations
created by the Second Supplemental Agreement (as defined in and attached to that
letter from Mr Kurokawa).

(D) By a letter to Post Office dated 3 July 2002, the Guarantor confirmed that the terms
of the guarantee dated 28 July 1999 referred to in Recital (B) would continue in full
force and effect in relation to the Original Codified Agreement as amended by the
Network Banking CCN referred to in that letter.

(E) In this Deed, the “Original Codified Agreement Guarantee” means the guarantee
dated 28 July 1999, the letter from Mr Kurokawa and the letter dated 3 July 2002
(referred to respectively in Recitals (B), (C) and (D) above).

(F) By a change control note, number 1100, dated 31% December 2002 (the
“Amendment CCN”) Post Office and Pathway agreed to vary and restate the terms of
the Original Codified Agreement (the Original Codified Agreement as varied and

Agreement’).

SCHEDULE 8

(G)

(I)

Pathway and Post Office intend that the Codified Agreement will be novated by the
assignment of Pathway’s rights and obligations thereunder to Fujitsu Services Limited
(registered in England and Wales under company number 00096056) by a Novation
Agreement (the “Novation Agreement”) to be entered into by Pathway, Post Office
and Fujitsu Services Limited on or around 1 April 2003. Upon the Novation
Agreement being entered into all references to the “Codified Agreement” in this Deed
of Guarantee will thereafter be read and construed as references to the Codified
Agreement as modified by the Novation Agreement and references to the obligations
of the Principal Obligors under the Codified Agreement will be to those obligations as
modified, assumed or released by the Novation Agreement.

In this Deed of Guarantee, “Principal Obligors” means Pathway and Fujitsu Services
Limited.

The Guarantor and Post Office now wish to discharge the Original Codified
Agreement Guarantee and enter into a new guarantee between themselves on the
terms hereinafter appearing. The Guarantor has agreed that the new guarantee shall
apply both to the Principal Obligors’ obligations under the Codified Agreement and to
Pathway's obligations under the consent agreement dated 16 September 1997
among the Secretary of State for Social Security (“DSS”), Post Office, Fujitsu
Services Holdings plc (formerly ICL plc), Pathway, and Fujitsu Services (Pathway
Asset Company) Limited (formerly ICL Pathway Asset Company Limited) (the
“Consent Agreement”). Discharge of the Consent Agreement is intended to be a
condition precedent to execution of the Novation Agreement.

In this Deed, “Agreements” means the Codified Agreement and the Consent
Agreement and “Agreement” shall be construed accordingly.

NOW THIS DEED WITNESSES AS FOLLOWS:-

With effect from the execution of this Deed of Guarantee, Post Office hereby
unconditionally and irrevocably releases the Guarantor from the Original Codified
Agreement Guarantee and each and any obligation which the Guarantor has or may
have under the Original Codified Agreement Guarantee, the Original Codified
Agreement Guarantee shall for all purposes be treated as discharged, and Post
Office agrees to deliver up the Original Codified Agreement Guarantee to the
Guarantor forthwith.

The Guarantor unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to Post Office the due and
punctual performance by the Principal Obligors of the Agreement and by Pathway of
the Consent Agreement and undertakes that upon demand by Post Office it shall
indemnify and keep Post Office indemnified against all losses, damages, costs and
expenses (including court costs and legal fees) which may be incurred by Post Office
arising out of all and any breach of any Agreement and provided always that the
liability of the Guarantor shall be no greater than the liability of the Principal Obligors
under the Agreements, without prejudice to Clause 11 of this Deed of Guarantee.
Notwithstanding the date of this Deed of Guarantee the Guarantor's obligations

SCHEDULE 8

hereunder shall extend to all breaches of any Agreement by the Principal Obligors
whensoever or howsoever any breach occurred whether before, on, or after the date
of this Deed of Guarantee and the Guarantor agrees that Post Office shall have the
right to enforce this Deed of Guarantee and pursue any claims and demands arising
out of or in respect thereof whether arising prior to, on, or subsequent to the date of
this Deed of Guarantee.

The Guarantor shall not be discharged or released from this Deed of Guarantee by
any arrangement made between the Principal Obligors and/or Post Office without the
assent of the Guarantor or by any amendment to or termination of any Agreement or
by any forbearance, waiver or indulgence whether as to payment, time, performance
or otherwise granted by Post Office in relation thereto and the Guarantor hereby
expressly consents to any and all such arrangements, amendments, terminations,
forbearances or indulgences.

The indemnity set out in Clause 1 of this Deed of Guarantee is irrevocable and
absolute and shall be a continuing security and accordingly it shall:

not be discharged by any partial performance (except to the extent of such partial
performance) by the Principal Obligors of their obligations under any Agreement; and

extend to cover the unperformed part of the obligations of the Principal Obligors (or
either of them) from time to time under each Agreement.

The obligations of the Guarantor under this Deed of Guarantee are those of primary
obligor and such obligations exist irrespective of any invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability of any provision of any Agreement. Post Office shall not be obliged
before taking steps to enforce this Deed of Guarantee against the Guarantor to obtain
judgment against either Principal Obligor or the Guarantor or any third party in any
Court, or to make or file any claim in a bankruptcy or liquidation of either Principal
Obligor or any third party, or to take any action whatsoever against either Principal
Obligor or the Guarantor or any third party.

The Guarantor warrants that it is a body corporate duly organised and validly existing
under the laws of Japan, with limited liability and has all power and authority to enter
into and perform the obligations contemplated by this Deed of Guarantee to be
performed by it and that this Deed of Guarantee constitutes its legal, valid and
binding obligations.

All sums payable by the Guarantor under this Deed of Guarantee shall be paid
without any set-off, lien or counterclaim, deduction or withholding, howsoever arising.
The parties agree that payment in accordance with this Clause 7 shall not constitute
a waiver of any rights or remedies that the Guarantor may have as against Post
Office.

None of the liabilities or obligations of the Guarantor under this Deed of Guarantee
shall be impaired or discharged by:

analogous proceedings in whatever jurisdiction;

any change in the constitution of either of the Principal Obligors or the Guarantor; or

any other matter which but for this provision might operate to discharge or exonerate
the Guarantor.

If any payment or other benefit received by Post Office in relation to the obligations of
the Principal Obligors (or either of them) pursuant to any Agreement are avoided,
reduced or invalidated by virtue of any applicable law then pro tanto the Guarantor's
obligations shall not be released or affected.

Until the obligations of the Principal Obligors pursuant to each Agreement have been
fully performed:

any rights of Post Office arising under each Agreement or seek to enforce
repayment from the Principal Obligors by way of indemnity, or otherwise;
and

9.2.2 the Guarantor shall not prove or claim a dividend in the insolvency of either
of the Principal Obligors without the consent of Post Office but shall do so if
directed by Post Office and will hold any benefit in trust for Post Office.

If any provision of this Deed of Guarantee is invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any
reason, such provision shall be severed and the remainder of the provisions hereof
shall continue in full force and effect as if this Deed of Guarantee had been executed
with the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision eliminated.

The Guarantor shall reimburse to Post Office all costs and expenses incurred by Post
Office in connection with the enforcement and administration, (excluding, for the
avoidance of doubt, any enforcement and administration costs incurred by Post
Office in enforcing or administering the Agreements as between the Principal
Obligors and Post Office), of all or any part of the obligations described herein,
including without limitation all legal costs and disbursements and court costs.

Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, any notice or other communication
affecting this Deed of Guarantee from one party to the other shall be made in writing
and signed by or on behalf of the other party making the notice or communication.

Deed of Guarantee to give or make to the other shall be given or made by leaving it
at, or by posting by ordinary prepaid first class post (airmail if overseas) or by
facsimile transmission to the address of the other party in the manner referred to in

Square, London EC2A 1SL to be its agent for the receipt of service of process in
England. It agrees that any document may be effectively served on it in connection
with proceedings in England and Wales by service on its agent, and Clause 13 above

In respect of each Financial Year, Fujitsu Services shall provide SI Support Services to
Post Office at the charges set out in the row labelled “SI Support Services” in the table
in paragraph 4.1.

In respect of each Financial Year, Fujitsu Services shall provide to Post Office the
services of the Core SI Team at no additional charge up to the value of “Pre-paid SI
Capacity” set out in the table in paragraph 4.1, subject to the provisions of Schedule 20.
The value of the Core SI Services provided by Fujitsu Services to Post Office in relation
to such Pre-paid SI Capacity shall be calculated on a time cost basis in the same way
as they are calculated for Additional Resources in paragraph 6.2.

Unless otherwise agreed in accordance with paragraph 11.16 of Schedule 20, the value

month is equal to or less than the relevant number referred to from paragraph
5.1.1.1. If the number of Branch originated Incidents recorded at the Help Desk
per calendar month exceeds that number, there will be no additional charge for
the Help Desk Service, but Fujitsu Services will be entitled to Service Level
relief in respect of the Help Desk Service in accordance with paragraph 4 of
Schedule 15.

Post Office may, upon giving to Fujitsu Services not less than 3 months notice,
increase or reduce the capacity of Branch originated Incidents recorded at the
Help Desk referred to from paragraph 5.1.1.1 by up to 20% in one step, no
more than one step to be invoked in any quarter of a Financial Year. Provided
that the capacity required for Branch originated Incidents recorded at the Help
Desk remains within the range set by the second and third rows of the table in
paragraph 5.1.1 above, the Charge for the Help Desk Service in the Operational
Charges Table shall, from the date of such increase or reduction in capacity be
correspondingly increased or reduced by an amount equal to £20.14 per Branch
originated Incident recorded at the Help Desk by which the capacity is so
increased or reduced.

5.2 System Service

5.2.1

The System Service Charges set out in the Operational Charges Table are
based on the number of Horizon Counter Positions set out, month by month, in
Annex B. Any increase or decrease in the actual number of Horizon Counter
Positions at the end of any calendar month relative to the number in Annex B
applicable to that calendar month (the “Monthly CP Difference”) will result in a
corresponding increase or decrease in System Service Charges. Subject to
paragraph 5.2.2, such increase or decrease in respect of any calendar month
will be calculated by multiplying the Monthly CP Difference in respect of that
calendar month by the unit price shown in the following table in respect of the
Financial Year in which such calendar month falls.

Fujitsu Services shall no later than 31 January 2003 secure an option from the
landlord of the existing data centre premises at Wigan and Bootle to:

5.4.1.1 extend the term of the leases of each of those premises to 31 March
2010; and

5.4.1.2 extend the area subject to the leases from 6,500 sq ft. to 8,000 sq ft.;
and

5.4.1.3 secure that those leases shall be subject to termination for convenience
on no less than 18 months prior notice by either landlord or tenant, such
period of notice not to take effect before 31 December 2005.

The option referred to in paragraph 5.4.1 shall be exercisable until 31 March

The Operational Charges are based on such option being exercised and the
tenancy of the premises referred to in paragraph 5.4.1 continuing to 31 March
2010. If the landlord terminates one or both of the leases early, Fujitsu Services
shall relocate to equivalent premises before the date of termination of the
relevant lease and, other than where such termination is for Fujitsu Services’
breach, the costs of such relocation shall be borne equally by Fujitsu Services
and Post Office subject to a cap on such costs to be borne by Post Office of
£3.36 million. If such termination is for Fujitsu Services breach, the costs of
such relocation shall be borne by Fujitsu Services in their entirety.

The Network Charges set out in the Operational Charges Table are based on the
assumed numbers of Branches set out, month by month, in Annex B.

5.5.1

Any increase or decrease in the actual number of Branches at the end of each
month relative to the number in Annex B applicable to that month (the “Monthly
Difference”) will result in a corresponding increase or decrease to the monthly
Network Charge. Such increase or decrease in Charge in each month will be
calculated by multiplying the Monthly Difference in respect of that month by the
unit price per Branch shown in the following table in respect of the Financial
Year in which such month falls:

5.6 Network Charges — Dial-up Transaction Volumes

5.6.1

Pending the introduction of ADSL to be carried out in accordance with the CCD
entitled “ADSL Roll Out Interface Specification (FS Ref: CS/IFS/012), the
primary technologies for network connection will be as follows:

5.6.1.1 Bronze ISDN for small and intermediate Branches;

5.6.1.2 Not Used.

5.6.1.3 Silver FRIACO Daytime for large Branches,

each as determined in accordance with the CCD entitled "Horizon Capacity
Management and Business Volumes” (PA/PER/033).

Where such connections are not available, the following second and third
choice options will be applied instead:

5.6.2.1 If no FRIACO, Silver Daytime ISDN;
5.6.2.2 If no ISDN, VSAT.
As the availability of the pre-ADSL primary choice technologies improves over

time, Fujitsu Services may at its own cost and without adversely affecting the
Charges to the Post Office, optimise the use of such availability by installing a

5.6.4 As ADSL becomes available, subject to paragraph 5.7.1, Fujitsu Services will
implement the ADSL network upgrade as provided for in paragraph 7.1.1, so as
to replace as many of the pre-ADSL technology connections as ADSL
availability permits.

If in respect of any Financial Year, as assessed at the end of that Financial Year:

5.6.7.1 Fujitsu Services has provided network capacity meeting the Network
Mix Criteria; and

5.6.7.2 the number of Dial up Transactions set out in the table in paragraph
5.6.6 is exceeded over that Financial Year taken as a whole,

Fujitsu Services shall be entitled to charge Post Office at the end of that
Financial Year for such excess Dial up Transactions at the rate of 2.5 pence per
Dial up Transaction

5.6.7.3 if in respect of any Financial Year, as assessed at the end of that
Financial Year, the number of Dial up Transactions over that Financial
Year taken as a whole (the “ Actual Number of Dial up Transactions “) is
less than the assumed number of Dial up Transactions set out in the
table in paragraph 5.6.6 over that Financial Year taken as a whole (the

to:

(Assumed Number of Dial up Transactions — Actual Number of Dial up
Transactions) x 2.5 pence

shall be available to Post Office to offset against Charges during any
subsequent Financial Year. The actual Charges to be offset in this way
shall be subject to agreement with Fujitsu Services, such agreement not
to be unreasonably withheld.

For the purposes of paragraph 5.6.7 the “Network Mix Criteria” shall be met in
respect of any Financial Year if in that Financial Year:

5.6.8.1 the proportions of Silver Daytime relative to the proportion of Bronze
ISDN

is not less than the relative proportions thereof set out in respect of that
Financial Year in the table in paragraph 5.6.5 above.

Post Office may request Fujitsu Services to increase the proportion of Silver
connections and reduce by an equal amount the proportion of Bronze ISDN
connections so as to reduce the number of necessary Dial up Transactions. The
price of an upgrade from Bronze ISDN to Silver FRIACO Daytime is £81 per
month and to Silver Daytime ISDN £280 per month. If requested to upgrade a
Branch from Bronze ISDN to Silver Daytime, Fujitsu Services will provide such
upgrade by means of FRIACO if FRIACO is available at that Branch.

If in respect of any Financial Year, as assessed at the end of that Financial Year,
the average number of Dial up Transactions over that Financial Year taken as a
whole is lower than the figure for that Financial Year as calculated by multiplying
the relevant number in the table in paragraph 5.6.6 by twelve, and such
reduction results from Post Office having made use of the upgrade option
described in paragraph 5.6.9 above, then Post Office shall be entitled to a
reduction in Operational Changes (Network). The amount of such reduction
shall be such as the Parties may reasonably agree reflects the corresponding
reduction in costs to Fujitsu Services.

ADSL capacity shall be provided on the basis that 15% of Branches shall have
a 20:1 contention connection and the balance will have a 50:1 contention
connection. Variations in this percentage, if requested by Post Office, may be
agreed at charges which equate to Fujitsu Services Cost of the difference
between the two levels of service.

The rates and prices set out in this paragraph 5.6 shall not be adjusted for
variations in the Retail Prices Index in accordance with paragraph 10.

If Fujitsu Services is able to demonstrate that at any time:

5.7.2.1 the maximum limit of Horizon Gateway Configurations set out in row 4
of Annex A is exceeded; and

5.7.2.2 as a result of the foregoing, the number of Horizon Gateway
configurations available for ADSL swap out purposes is reduced to less

5.7.2.3 solely as a result of such shortfall in Horizon Gateway configurations
available for ADSL swap out purposes the introduction of ADSL cannot
proceed as planned; and

5.7.2.4 Fujitsu Services shall have consulted with Post Office on how best to
mitigate the duration and financial impacts of any such delay; and

5.7.2.5 Fujitsu Services shall have used its reasonable endeavours to mitigate
the duration and financial impacts of any such delay,

to the extent that Fujitsu Services is reasonably able to demonstrate to Post
Office on an Open Book basis that such factors either have caused or will cause
Fujitsu Services to incur additional telecommunications rental costs and/or
additional ADSL related implementation costs over the ADSL implementation
period, Post Office shall pay to Fujitsu Services, by way of additional
Operational Charge, amounts, not exceeding £0.67 million in any calendar
month in aggregate, equal to the amounts of such additional costs incurred by
Fujitsu Services over the period of ADSL implementation as a direct
consequence of the delay.

5.8 Network Charges - ADSL coverage

5.8.1

Certain levels of ADSL coverage are assumed year by year. If, on a yearly
basis, such percentage availability is either exceeded or not achieved with
respect to the network of Branches taken as a whole, adjustments to Network
Charges shall be made in accordance with this paragraph 5.8.

The Network Charges in the Operational Charges Table shall be reduced or

Post Office has nominated a number of Branches in which it wishes to retain
ISDN after ADSL has been implemented in those Branches. The Branches in
question are listed in the CRD entitled “Retained ISDN Sites”, reference
CS/PLA/097 (the “ISDN List”).

Any Branch may have ISDN switched on and be added to the ISDN List at Post
Office's option by giving no less than 15 Working Days’ notice in writing to
Fujitsu Services, provided that:

5.9.2.1 Fujitsu Services has not given notice to its supplier to cease the ISDN
line for that Branch; and

5.9.2.2 The total number of Branches on the ISDN List does not exceed 2050.

In the event that such a request from Post Office would cause the limit of 2050
to be exceeded the request will be handled via the Hard Change Control
Procedure.

Any Branch where ISDN has been activated for a minimum period of 12 months
may have ISDN deactivated and be removed from the ISDN List at Post Office's
option by giving no less than 15 Working Days’ notice in writing to Fujitsu
Services. The Branches in question will have ISDN deactivated following
completion of the notice period. The adjustment to the Network Charges in
paragraph 5.9.5 shall apply until the end of the month in which ISDN is so
deactivated.

Any new Branch or a Branch that needs to have the ISDN line reactivated shall
be handled via Operational Business Change and would then be added to the
ISDN List, provided that the total number of Branches on the ISDN List does not
exceed 2050 in which case the ISDN reactivation would be handled via the
Hard Change Control Procedure.

The monthly Network Service charge for each month or part thereof shall be
increased by an amount equal to:

5.9.5.1 the number of Branches where ISDN has been retained in accordance
with paragraphs 5.9.1 to 5.9.4 for any part of that month multiplied by

5.9.5.2 either

(c) £26.00 per month to 31%' March 2006; or

(d) £24.89 thereafter.
Subject to paragraph 5.9.7 the British Telecom service known as Total Care as
described on www.bt.com website (“Total Care”) will be provided by Fujitsu
Services for each Branch using ISDN network technology until 17 Working Days

after the date on which Fujitsu Services determines that the ADSL service to
that Branch has satisfied certain criteria regarding quality of that service.

Total Care may be deactivated for that ISDN line at Post Office’s option by Post
Office giving no less than 17 Working Days’ notice in writing to Fujitsu Services.
The adjustment to the Network Service charges in paragraph 5.9.9 shall apply
until the end of the month in which Total Care is so deactivated.

From February 2005 until March 2006 inclusive, the monthly Network Service
charge shall be increased by an amount equal to:

5.9.9.2 the number of ISDN lines for which Total Care shall have been provided
in accordance with paragraphs 5.9.6 to 5.9.8 for any part of that month.

With effect from 1 April 2006, and annually thereafter, the price per ISDN line at
paragraph 5.9.9.1 shall be recalculated based on the British
Telecommunications Retail price for Total Care then in force and any resulting
change to the rate shall be introduced via the Change Control Procedure .

5.9.11 The total number of GSM Connections available is limited in accordance with the

5.9.12

5.9.13

CCD entitled “Branch Network Resilience Service Description” (CS/SER/031).
The number of new GSM Connections that can be made in a rolling four week
period shall not exceed 92, with the weekly target being 23 new GSM
Connections. In the event that an engineer is despatched to establish a GSM
Connection as described in the CCD entitled “Branch Network Resilience
Service Description” (CS/SER/031)) and is denied access to the Branch through
no fault of Fujitsu Services, that attempted visit shall count towards the limit for
the four week period in question. For the purposes of these limits the four week
periods shall commence on the Working Day following the completion of the
BNR pilot.

The Charges for each call made using a GSM Connection shall be 15.5 pence
per minute and may be varied by Fujitsu Services in accordance with changes
in its costs from its supplier.

Where Fujitsu Services would have been obliged to arrange and undertake a
Recovery Visit (as defined in paragraph 1.4 of Annex 2 to Schedule 15) and as
a result of a GSM Connection having been established such Recovery Visit is
not necessary, Post Office shall be entitled to a credit of £64.00 against the
Network Service Operational Charges for the month in which the Recovery Visit
would have taken place.

5.10.1 The subcontract with Energis is due to expire on 31 March 2007. If it is agreed
by 31 March 2006 that:

5.10.1.1a new network supplier be subcontracted by Fujitsu Services and as a
consequence there is a change in Fujitsu Services Cost with respect to
operational costs or the change brings about transition costs; or

5.10.1.2 a new network supplier be subcontracted by Post Office directly and as
a consequence Fujitsu Services ceases to incur the operational costs of
such supply but may incur additional costs brought about by transition;
or

5.10.1.3 the existing subcontract be extended by Fujitsu Services but as a
consequence there is a change in Fujitsu Services Cost with respect to
operational costs;

the Parties shall agree revisions to the Operational Charges and, if applicable,
to Implementation Charges such that Fujitsu Services is neither better nor
worse off. Fujitsu Services shall make available to Post Office such information
as is reasonably required on an Open Book basis to enable such revisions to be
agreed. Fujitsu Services has based its Network Charges beyond 31 March
2007 on the assumption that supply prices will reduce year on year by 2.5% on
average, before indexation in line with increases in RPI.

5.10.2 If so requested by Post Office, Fujitsu Services will investigate the possibility of
early termination of the Energis sub-contract and will notify Post Office of the
likely cost and impact. If Post Office requests Fujitsu Services to terminate the
sub-contract early the Parties shall agree revisions to the Operational Charges

paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 below shall apply to the Services referred to in those paragraphs
and any new services introduced under the Change Control Procedure.

In addition, the Parties have agreed that the risk/reward models described in paragraph
5 below and other risk/reward models may be applied to new services. Neither Party
shall be compelled to enter into any such risk/reward arrangement as a precondition for
contracting for a new service.

BENCHMARKING

On and from 1 September 2005, Post Office shall have the right, subject to paragraph
2.2 below, to benchmark:

2.1.1. any of the Operational Services set out in paragraph 2.4 below (each a
“Benchmarkable Service"); and

2.1.2 any change to any of the Benchmarkable Services where such change has
been requested by Post Office under the Change Control Procedure but there is
disagreement between the Parties as to the appropriate Charge for the new or
modified aspect of the Benchmarkable Service.

Unless the Parties agree it would be more appropriate to benchmark the entire

Benchmarkable Service, any benchmarking carried out under paragraph 2.1.2 above

shall be in respect of the new or modified aspect of the Benchmarkable Service only.

No particular Benchmarkable Service (or change to a Benchmarkable Service) may be

benchmarked more frequently than once every two years (unless otherwise agreed by

the Parties);

The option of whether to initiate benchmarking will be at Post Office's sole discretion.

Benchmarking may be carried out in respect of Charges relative to output for:

2.4.1. Horizon System Help Desk Service

2.4.2 Engineer Service; and

2.4.3 Data Centre Operations Service.

Post Office shall notify Fujitsu Services of its intention to benchmark a Benchmarkable

Service in writing not less than three (3) months prior to the carrying out of such
benchmark.

Post Office shall appoint a third party benchmarking consultant (the "Benchmarker") for
each benchmarking. The Benchmarker shall be an independent recognised expert at
providing benchmarking services in respect of the Benchmarkable Service being
benchmarked and shall be agreed with Fujitsu Services (such agreement not to be
unreasonably withheld).

Prior to 1 September 2005 the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to agree a form of
non-disclosure agreement (the “Agreed Form NDA”) for use in connection with any
benchmarking exercise. If requested by either Party, the Benchmarker shall be required
to execute an Agreed Form NDA. Neither Fujitsu Services nor Post Office will be
obliged to disclose any of its confidential information to the Benchmarker until an
Agreed Form NDA has been executed by the Benchmarker. Nothing in this paragraph
2.7 shall prevent Post Office, Fujitsu Services and the Benchmarker mutually agreeing
an alternative form of non-disclosure agreement.

The Parties will consult with the appointed Benchmarker over the setting up of any
appropriate benchmarking criteria (the “Benchmarking Criteria”) which may be
necessary in addition to the Like for Like Criteria defined in paragraph 2.11 below in
order to determine the competitiveness of the Benchmarkable Service in terms of
overall value for money. Where the Benchmarker, exercising his reasonable judgement,
determines that it is not possible to carry out a direct "like for like" comparison, he shall
propose to the Parties a price weighting mechanism to adjust for any relevant
differences including (without limitation) differences in specifications, conditions or
environment such that the benchmarking can be carried out.

If the Parties:

2.9.1 agree on the price weighting mechanism proposed by the Benchmarker, such
price weighting mechanism shall be applied to the benchmarking;

2.9.2 agree on amendments to the price weighting mechanism proposed by the
Benchmarker, such amended price weighting mechanism shall be applied to the
benchmarking; or

2.9.3. cannot agree on the price weighting mechanism proposed by the Benchmarker
or on appropriate amendments to such price weighting mechanism within thirty
(30) days of the price weighting mechanism being proposed by the
Benchmarker, such dispute shall be referred to the Dispute Resolution
Procedure using expert determination as the final Stage (as defined in the
Annex 2 to Schedule 4) if prior Stages have failed to resolve the dispute. The
role of such expert shall be to determine the price weighting mechanism which
shall be used by the Benchmarker.

The Parties shall instruct the Benchmarker to:

2.10.1 evaluate the Benchmarkable Service on an overall "like for like" comparative
basis, applying the:

2.10.1.1 Like for Like Criteria; and

apply the price weighting mechanism (if any) agreed by the Parties or
determined by an expert in accordance with paragraph 2.9 above;

complete its analysis within thirty (30) calendar days or such other period as
may be agreed between the Parties and to present a written report to each of
Post Office and Fujitsu Services. Such report shall:

2.10.4.1 set out, in respect of each benchmarked Benchmarkable
Service the lowest available charges available from the
Relevant Suppliers (such charges adjusted to reflect the price
weighting mechanism (if any)) on a "like for like" basis; and

2.10.4.2 clarify any differences between each benchmarked
Benchmarkable Service and the equivalent service provided by
the Relevant Supplier in respect of each of the Benchmarking
Criteria taken into account by the Benchmarker (including any
difference in associated technology used to provide those
services).

2.11 In determining what is "like for like" as referred to in paragraph 2.10 above, the
Benchmarker shall take into account the following criteria (the “Like for Like Criteria”):

2.11.1

2.11.2

2.11.3

2.11.4

2.11.5

2.11.6

the full range of locations in which the Benchmarkable Service is provided;

the Service Level and availability provisions of this Agreement applicable to the
Benchmarkable Service;

the performance of that Benchmarkable Service in respect of the provisions
referred to in paragraph 2.11.2 above;

all other provisions of this Agreement relevant to the costs of providing the
Benchmarkable Service including, without limitation, provisions relating to
system and service security, Fujitsu Services’ liability and the functionality and
specification of the Benchmarkable Service;

the need to compare services (equivalent to the Benchmarkable Service)
supplied to similarly sized organisations conducting a similar type of business
as Post Office;

the total value of the Benchmarkable Service under the Agreement and the term
of the Agreement; and

2.11.7 inputs to and outputs from the Benchmarkable Service in relation to other
Services,

but shall not take into account any charges available from Relevant Suppliers which are
in the reasonable opinion of the Benchmarker temporarily priced at low level to
eliminate a competitive threat (predatory pricing).

Subject to paragraph 2.7 above, within three (3) months of receiving written notification
from Post Office that benchmarking will be initiated, or such longer period as may be
agreed between the Parties, Fujitsu Services shall make available to the appointed
Benchmarker all information relevant to the Like for Like Criteria and the Benchmarking
Criteria and each of the Parties shall provide such other information as may be
requested from it by the Benchmarker in order to carry out the benchmarking exercise.
Such information provided by Fujitsu Services will be provided in manner and format
reasonably requested by Post Office. Fujitsu Services shall ensure that such
information provided by it is complete and accurate and shall inform the Benchmarker
as soon as reasonably practicable upon discovering any inaccuracy.

If the benchmarking exercise produces verifiable evidence that a benchmarked
Benchmarkable Service is less competitive (taking into account all of the matters set out
in paragraph 2.10 above) than an equivalent service available to Post Office in the
market place, then the parties will negotiate in good faith to agree under the Change
Control Procedure a revision of the Charges to match the outcome of the benchmarking
exercise.

If the Parties fail to reach agreement on such revision to the Charges, the dispute will be
referred to expert determination in accordance with the Dispute Resolution Procedure.
The purpose of such reference shall be to determine what would be a fair and
reasonable revision to the Charges to reflect the outcome of the benchmarking
exercise.

In order to give effect to paragraphs 2.13 and 2.14 above, Fujitsu Services will furnish
all information reasonably necessary to enable the parties to agree or, failing
agreement, to enable an expert to whom it is referred to determine, a fair and
reasonable revision to the Charges.

If Fujitsu Services matches the revision to the Charges determined by an expert in
accordance with paragraph 2.14 above, Post Office will accept new Charges on that
basis.

If Fujitsu Services fails to match the revision to the Charges determined by an expert in
accordance with paragraph 2.14 then Post Office shall have the right to conduct, and
require Fujitsu Services to co-operate and assist with, a tender process for the sub-
contracting by Fujitsu Services of the Benchmarkable Service in question to an
alternative service provider (the “Replacement Sub-Contractor”). If the Parties agree
that it would be more appropriate for Fujitsu Services to conduct, and Post Office to co-
operate and assist with, the tender process, then the Parties shall procure the same.

Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, Fujitsu Services shall disclose to
any bona fide potential Replacement Sub-Contractor (subject to the same executing an
Agreed Form NDA or any other form of non-disclosure agreement mutually agreed by
Post Office, Fujitsu Service and such bona fide potential Replacement Sub-Contractor)
Confidential Information to the extent that such disclosure is reasonably required to
enable any potential Replacement Sub-Contractor to prepare a reasonably detailed
tender proposal.

If the outcome of any tender process is such that, if Fujitsu Service were to sub-contract
the Benchmarkable Service in question to a Replacement Sub-Contractor identified in
the tender process a downward revision to the Charges would be, in the mutual opinion
of the Post Office and such Replacement Sub-Contractor deliverable, then Post Office
shall have the right to require Fujitsu Services to sub-contract such Benchmarkable
Service to such Replacement Sub-Contractor and revise its Charges accordingly so that
the Charge for that Benchmarkable Service shall be equivalent to the cost to Fujitsu
Services of that sub-contract and the reasonable contract management costs incurred
by Fujitsu Services.

Revisions to the Charges which are agreed pursuant to paragraphs 2.13 or 2.16 above
or in connection with the appointment of a Replacement Sub-Contractor pursuant to
paragraph 2.19 above shall take effect retrospectively from:

2.20.1 the date of commencement of the relevant benchmarking in the case of a
benchmarking related to the terms of paragraph 2.1.1 above; and

2.20.2 the date of approval by both parties of the relevant change in the case of a
benchmarking related to the terms of paragraph 2.1.2 above.

Post Office and Fujitsu Services shall each bear their own costs in relation to any
benchmarking exercise, including costs related to the provision of relevant data.

Post Office shall bear all fees and costs of the Benchmarker and any costs and
expenses relating to third party benchmarking consultation and support.

Post Office and Fujitsu Services shall bear all fees and costs of any expert
determination carried out in respect of a benchmarking exercise in accordance with the
Dispute Resolution Procedure in equal shares.

The Parties shall be obliged to perform their respective obligations under this
Agreement during any benchmarking exercise.

The Parties shall use their best endeavours to ensure that any benchmarking exercise
causes as little disruption as possible to the respective businesses of the Parties and to
the delivery of the Services.

Agreement to the contrary, put out to competitive tender its requirement for any new
services.

Where such competitive tender results in fixed price work being awarded to Fujitsu

Services, that work will not then be subject to the open book regime described in

paragraph 4 below.

OPEN BOOK

Where used in this Agreement, “Open Book” shall mean that Fujitsu Services shall as

soon as reasonably practicable upon request by Post Office provide evidence which

reasonably demonstrates value for money on the following basis:

4.1.1 use of appropriate methods (including, without limitation, for process or design);

4.1.2 that direct costs are verifiable; and

4.1.3 that methods of applying indirect costs, risk contingency, financing costs (if
appropriate) and margin are compliant with any applicable provisions of this
Agreement and consistent with generally accepted practice among Relevant
Suppliers.

Such evidence shall be in the form of such financial, accounting and other information of

Fujitsu Services as Post Office may reasonably require to validate Fujitsu Services

charges and/or proposed charges for the service or service modification in question on

that basis.

The use of Open Book is appropriate where:

4.2.1 Post Office and Fujitsu Services are proposing to work together in relation to the
proposed new or modified service;

4.2.2 Post Office decides that competition is inappropriate because the Horizon
Services Infrastructure contains bespoke design; and/or

4.2.3 the proposed service differs markedly from industry norms.

Examples of the categories in paragraph 4.2 above are: systems integration and
development network communications, specialist operations and support functions.

Open Book shall be available on request by Post Office only where:

4.4.1. benchmarking or competition is not possible in accordance with the provisions
of paragraphs 2 or 3 (respectively) of this Schedule 11; or

4.4.2 aWork Order specifically provides for Open Book.

45 Open Book is not a mechanism to make changes to Charges for Services set out in this
Agreement save where the Parties have agreed herein that Charges will be verified on
an Open Book basis.

5. RISK/REWARD

5.1 Principles

5.1.1

5.1.6

These paragraphs describe the options and principles for constructing
risk/reward models that shall be available for use under the Agreement on a
case by case basis. The options are not exhaustive.

Risk/reward shall be an optional arrangement and neither Party shall be
compelled to enter into a risk/reward arrangement as a precondition for
contracting for a new service. The Parties may modify or adapt the principles
set out in this paragraph 5 if they agree that would be appropriate.

Risk/reward may be constructed on the basis of:

5.1.3.1 sponsorship: whereby Post Office provides the initial investment
required in order to derive savings;

5.1.3.2 partnership: whereby both inputs and outputs are shared by Post Office
and Fujitsu Services; or

5.1.3.3 work-package terms: such as capped time and materials.

The objective of risk/reward is to align purpose and so increase the likelihood
and degree of success.

Risk/reward models shall reflect the abilities of each Party to manage risk and
contribute to the outcome.

The default by which to judge all risk/reward models is time and materials.

5.2 Risk/reward models

5.2.1

5.2.2

Sponsorship model

Where Post Office sponsors future investment to reduce the cost of a service or
improve a service for the same cost, those cost savings or service
improvements shall be passed on to Post Office in reduced charges or at no
incremental charge respectively.

Joint Venture or Partnership model

§.2.2.1 Fujitsu Services and Post Office shall share the risks and rewards on
a ‘joint venture” basis. There are two ways in which this may be
effected:

SCHEDULE 11 Version 5.0

Page 8 of 10

FUJ00000083
FUJ00000083
CONFIDENTIAL

Fujitsu Services shall carry out investment and charge to Post
Office at cost and rely on a share of Post Office's benefits for its
return; or

Fujitsu Services shall carry out investment at its own cost and
rely on a significantly greater share of Post Office’s benefits to
recover both its investment and its return.

5.2.2.2 The target reward (the share of the expected business benefits) shall be
calibrated to the value of the financial and intellectual contribution to be
made by Fujitsu Services, and the degree of risk in the benefits, on a
case by case basis.

5.2.2.3 The expected business benefits shall be discounted year by year at a
discount rate of typically 17.5% to 22.5% in constant money (including
risk premium) to arrive at a net present value of those expected
benefits. Fujitsu Services’ percentage share of those expected benefits
shall be set so as to equate to the default value of the default time and
materials charge plus the value of any out of the ordinary intellectual
contribution.

5.2.2.4 The eventual value of the benefit share to Fujitsu Services shall depend
on the actual outcome, which accordingly shall be objectively
measurable.

5.2.3 Work-package risk/reward model

5.2.3.1 Fixed price

(a)

Fixed pricing is appropriate where all key cost drivers and
programme dependencies are under a supplier's control. If that
is not the case, the supplier will look for significant
contingencies of both time and cost, which may not represent
value for money for the customer and may impact unnecessarily
‘on time to market.

The supplier shall enjoy the benefit of any cost reduction and
conversely shall bear the cost of any over-run. The style of
working is characterised by work-package delivery at
completion as opposed to joint working.

Fujitsu Services may undertake systems integration work on a
fixed price basis where third party or end to end considerations
do not dilute its control.

5.2.3.2 Time and materials

(a)

SCHEDULE 11 Version 5.0

Page 9 of 10

The customer shall enjoy the benefit of any cost reduction and
conversely shall bear the cost of any over-run.

FUJ00000083
FUJ00000083
CONFIDENTIAL

(c)

The customer may have little control over delivery and the
supplier may have insufficient incentive to manage efficiently
and well what is under his control. To counter these concerns,
the supplier provides open access to customer representatives
to scrutinise progress and costs, which may be disruptive and
increase cost.

The pervasive degree of third party and end to end
dependencies in most delivery plans has historically made time
and materials Fujitsu Services' preferred method of trading on
systems integration. However, it is open to all other methods of
dealing with the external dependencies such that ways are
found to move away from this in the future.

5.2.3.3 Capped time and materials

(a)

(b)

SCHEDULE 11 Version 5.0
Page 10 of 10

This basis of pricing may be appropriate where the supplier has
a substantial amount of control but there are nonetheless
significant dependencies on the customer.

The cap places a clear incentive on the supplier to manage
delivery in terms of both time and cost.

In using this basis of pricing there should also be a floor to
reward (and not penalise) the supplier for efficient quality
delivery within time and cost.

The cap can be an absolute time and cost cap or a time cap
after which the applicable man-rate is reduced.

In common with the fixed price basis of pricing, the supplier will
look for contingency to be included within the cap. The required
contingency will be greater if there is no floor and where the cap
on price is an absolute cap.

Note 1: Fujitsu Services shall purchase sufficient memory chips (to be charged to Post Office at the lesser of Fujitsu Services Cost or the cap in paragraph
7.1.1 of S10) to upgrade all Counter configurations (including Gateway configurations) by the addition of 128 megabytes of main memory to each
configuration. This memory will then be installed by Fujitsu Services to its stock of spare system units and to any other unit that is returned to Fujitsu Services
for repair or recycling (including return as a result of the Network Re-Invention Programme). Fujitsu Services will upgrade the memory in Gateway
configurations as and when ADSL communications capability is installed. Those configurations not passing through Fujitsu Services’ hands will not be
upgraded unless required by Post Office.

Note 2: Network Re-invention is a programme of Branch changes and closures to improve the efficiency of the Post Office Branch network. This programme
will result in a reduction in the number of operational Post Office Branches and shall release Horizon counter systems which will be returned to Fujitsu
Services. The programme is to be managed by Post Office. Post Office shall task Fujitsu Services to carry out moves and changes through OBC orders (the
process for which may be modified according to the review referred to in row 20) to comply with the limits in Schedule 10 Annex A, rows 2, 3 and 4.

Note 3: Unless a viable alternative is agreed, it is planned to update the counter operating system to Windows 2000 to facilitate potential adoption of future

Note 5:

1. It is envisaged that the E2E Re—Architecting Programme (the “Programme”) will be carried out in five Development Process Stages: Feasibility Study
(rows 1 and 13), Requirements Analysis (rows 15, 22 and 28), Solution Specification/Commercial Terms (rows 29 and 32), Solution Build & Test (row
31 and 33), and Implementation (row 36). It has been agreed between the Parties that these stages will be commissioned and carried out in the
following manner and that Fujitsu Services will produce the following deliverables (among others):

in the course of the Feasibility Study:

(1) an estimate of the savings in the Charges which will result if the Programme is satisfactorily completed (as envisaged in the Feasibility Study)
and, if this figure differs from the figure referred to in paragraph 5.11 of Schedule 10, a reconciliation and explanation of the difference; and

(2) an estimate of the likely charges which would be incurred by Post Office in respect of all future Development Process Stages of the
Programme were the Programme to be carried out in the manner envisaged in the Feasibility Study.

in the course of the Requirements Analysis:

(1) an estimate of the savings in the Charges which will result if the Programme is satisfactorily completed (as envisaged in the Feasibility Study)
revised to reflect the information resulting from the Requirements Analysis and, if this figure differs from the estimate produced as part of the
Feasibility Study, a reconciliation and explanation of the difference; and

(2) the indicative costs which would be incurred by Post Office in respect of all future Development Process Stages of the Programme were the
Programme to be carried out in the manner envisaged in the Feasibility Study (as revised by the Requirements Analysis),setting out all
significant assumptions used in arriving at that indicative cost on an ‘open book' basis.

in the course of the Solution Specification/Commercial Proposal Stage:

(1) a firm estimate of the savings in the Charges which will result if the Programme is satisfactorily completed (as envisaged in the Solution
Specification) and, if this figure differs from the estimate produced as part of the Feasibility Study, a reconciliation and explanation of the

difference; and

(2) the Commercial Terms on which Fujitsu Services would be prepared to carry out the Solution Build & Test Stage and the Implementation Stage
were the Programme to be carried out in the manner envisaged in the Solution Specification Stage.

2. Where any of the above deliverables contains an estimate of the savings in the Charges which varies from the figure which at the time in question
appears in paragraph 5.11 of Schedule 10 by more than 10%, the Parties shall agree:

e that the Operating Charges shall be amended by the difference if the reason is a change in scope of requirements as compared with that itemised
in Annexe B of this Schedule 12; or

e that Post Office requirements will be simplified or changed to enable the intended savings to be achieved; or

Resolution Procedure.

SERVICE LEVELS AND REMEDIES
41. INTRODUCTION
441 This Schedule defines up to three thresholds in respect of each Service Level as

2.2

2.3

24

2.5

follows:

1.1.1. The level of Service (“Service Level Target” or “SLT”) required from Fujitsu
Services by Post Office. Not all SLT failures give rise to payment of liquidated
damages.

1.1.2 I The level of Service which, if not achieved by Fujitsu Services, shall give rise to
payment of liquidated damages by Fujitsu Services (the “Liquidated Damage
Threshold” or “LDT"). Payment of liquidated damages notwithstanding, a
failure of any LDT shall not (on its own) constitute a Default.

1.1.3. The level of Service below the SLT and (if applicable) the LDT which if not
achieved by Fujitsu Services shall give rise to payment by Fujitsu Services of
Post Office's Additional Costs or liquidated damages as described (where
relevant) in this Schedule (the “Additional Remedy Level’ or “ARL’).

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

The purpose of remedies (liquidated damages or any other additional remedy specified
in this Schedule 15) is that Post Office shall not be disadvantaged by failures of Fujitsu
Services to provide the Services to the agreed specification and reliability.

All liquidated damage calculations in accordance with the provisions of this Schedule 15
(other than those in paragraphs 5.4, 6.8 and 6.9 of Annex 3) shall be subject to RPI
indexation in accordance with the provisions set out in paragraph 10.5 of Schedule 10.

For the avoidance of doubt, liquidated damages shall be based upon the applicable
fixed amounts or rates stated in this Schedule 15 as adjusted by RPI indexation up to
the relevant Financial Year in which the LDT or ARL failure occurred.

The performance of the Services against the SLT, LDT and ARL applicable in respect of
each Service Level shall be measured and reported and success or failure against each
shall be judged over Service Level Measurement Periods. Additionally, all levels of
service shall be monitored on a weekly and monthly basis and any failure to meet a
Service Level assessed over that month shall be reported to Post Office by means of
the Service Review Book produced on a monthly basis detailing all Service Levels and
the actual levels of service achieved.

In respect of any SLT that has a Service Level Measurement Period equivalent to a SLT
Calendar Year or a Service Level Measurement Period that is otherwise defined with

Schedule 15 Version 7.0

reference to a SLT Calendar Year, in the event that the remainder of the term of the
Agreement after the last SLT Calendar Year of the term of the Agreement in relation to
that SLT (“Final Period”) is less than 6 months then Fujitsu Services shall:

2.5.1 continue to measure and report performance against that SLT during the Final
Period; and

2.5.2 not be obliged to take any remedial action should that SLT fail to be achieved at
any time during the Final Period.

The values applicable to each SLT and other targets referred to in this Schedule 15 are
not given in this Schedule 15, but are instead set out in the CCD entitled “Service Level
Targets for Horizon Services” (CS/SLA/002). The SLT and other target values in the
version of that CCD (as agreed from time to time under the Soft Change Control
Procedure) which is in force at the relevant time shall be deemed incorporated by
reference in this Schedule, each having a unique identifier in the form “<XXYY>".

In the event that that an SLT value is stated in this Schedule and in the CCD entitled
“Service Level Targets for Horizon Services” (CS/SLA/002), the value in the version of
that CCD (as agreed from time to time under the Soft Change Control Procedure) which
is in force at the relevant time shall have precedence.

Subject to any provisions to the contrary in this Schedule 15 in respect of a particular
Service Level, where Service Levels are expressed in terms of performance required by
a particular “Day”, “Day A” means the day of the specified triggering event (such as the
date of a Transaction), “Day B” means the day following Day A, “Day C” means the day
following Day B and so on.

SERVICE LEVELS

The Annexes to this Schedule define the Service Level Targets, Liquidated Damage
Thresholds and Additional Remedy Levels for the following groups of Services:

3.1.1. Support Desk Services (Annex 1);
3.1.2 Data Delivery Services (Annex 2);
3.1.3. Banking Services (Annex 3); and

3.1.4. Miscellaneous Services (Annex 4).

3.2 Paragraph 4 to Annex 1 of this Schedule details the entirety of the
Service Levels and Service Level regime that shall apply to the PostShop Solution.

Annex 5 to this Schedule sets out the limits (the “Volumetric Limits”) which if exceeded
over a specified period (the “Relevant Period”) will entitle Fujitsu Services to adjust the
measurements of performance in respect of the Service Levels (SLTs and (if applicable)
the LDTs and ARLs) affected by that excess (the “Affected Service Levels”). Such
adjustment shall be made on the following basis:

4.1.1 _ If the Relevant Period for a Volumetric Limit is a calendar month and that limit is
exceeded, Fujitsu Services shall identify for joint consideration with Post Office
the days in that month on which the average daily volume (based upon
measurements of actual volumes over the previous three months, or otherwise
as agreed by the Parties (acting reasonably)) has been exceeded and shall
specify for joint consideration the reasons for that excess if caused or
contributed to by Fujitsu Services.

4.1.2 If the Relevant Period for a Volumetric Limit is a day and that limit is exceeded,
Fujitsu Services shall specify for joint consideration the reason for that excess if
caused or contributed to by Fujitsu Services.

4.1.3 For each day on which the average daily volume referred to in paragraph 4.1.1
or the Volumetric Limit referred to in paragraph 4.1.2 is exceeded:

1.1.7 asa result of Default by Fujitsu Services, no adjustment shall be made
to the performance measurements for the Affected Service Levels in
respect of that day; or

1.1.7. for any reason other than a Default by Fujitsu Services, the
performance measurements for the Affected Service Levels in respect
of that day shall be disregarded and replaced with an average
measurement for that day (based upon actual performance
measurements over the previous three calendar months, or otherwise
as agreed by the Parties (acting reasonably)).

Following each Service Level Measurement Period the Parties will assess whether, on
average, over the relevant Service Level Measurement Period any of the Volumetric
Limits has been exceeded by 10% or more. In making that assessment the Parties
shall consider the cause of any daily peaks in excess of daily averages during that
period, and disregard the measurements in respect of those days where the peaks have
arisen as a result of Fujitsu Service's Default. If having made such assessment, the
Parties agree that a Volumetric Limit has been exceeded by 10% (and in the case of
monthly Volumetric Limits, those limits have been exceeded in any three consecutive
months), the Parties shall meet to discuss and agree (acting reasonably) appropriate
changes to the Volumetric Limits and any change to the applicable Service Levels.

Any dispute arising in connection with the application of this paragraph 4 shall be
resolved in accordance with the Dispute Resolution Procedure.

The CCD entitled “Horizon Capacity Management and Business Volumes”
(PA/PER/033) (the “Business Volumes CCD”) defines various limits on numbers of
Transactions or instances of Service as “Contracted Volumes” or “Design Limits” for
EPOSS, APS, LFS, Message Broadcast Service, Reference Data Management Service,
NBS, DCMoP and on-line Transactions.

On each day that any of the Contracted Volumes referred to in the table below (and
detailed in the Business Volumes CCD) is exceeded, the measures of Fujitsu Service's
performance for the Service Levels (SLTs and (if applicable) the LDTs and ARLs) listed
in the table below shall be disregarded and replaced with an average measurement for
that day (based upon actual performance measurements over the previous three
calendar months, or otherwise as agreed by the Parties (acting reasonably)):

Office's satisfaction (Post Office acting reasonably) that failure to meet the Service
Level and/or service target, as the case may be, occurred as a result of a Design Limit
being exceeded. Fujitsu Services shall use reasonable endeavours to meet those

measurements of Fujitsu Services performance in respect of all Service Levels
detrimentally affected by such suspension (in respect of those Applications and
Services) shall be disregarded and Fujitsu Services shall be released from those of its
obligations in respect of those Applications and Services which it is unable to perform as
a result of such suspension.

If Fujitsu Services fails to achieve any Service Level or service target (as the case may
be) and can demonstrate to Post Office's reasonable satisfaction that such failure
occurred as a result of a fault or problem within the QAS Software, such fault or problem
requiring Third Line Software Support Services or Fourth Line Support in order to be
resolved, then the measures of Fujitsu Service's performance in respect of such Service
Level and other service target shall be disregarded for the period affected by the QAS
Software fault or problem.

RECTIFICATION PLAN

In the event that an ARL specified in this Schedule 15 is failed, Fujitsu Services and
Post Office shall agree a method of rectification and timetable for the resolution of the
cause of that failure (a “Rectification Plan”). For the avoidance of doubt, Fujitsu Service
shall remain liable for financial remedies payable in accordance with this Schedule in
respect of that failure.

In the event that the Rectification Plan involves a change to the provision of the
Services, such change shall be agreed under the appropriate Change Control
Procedure and shall be made at no charge to Post Office.

Without prejudice to Post Office’s rights to remedies provided in this Agreement, during
the period the Rectification Plan is being implemented Fujitsu Services shall maintain
performance of all other Services in accordance with the Service Levels specified in this
Schedule 15 unless otherwise agreed with Post Office as part of the Rectification Plan.

In the event that the Rectification Plan is not agreed by the Parties (acting reasonably)

within three (3) calendar months of the occurrence of an ARL failure or the Rectification
Plan fails to resolve the cause of the ARL failure to which it relates, such that that ARL

failure occurs again and is persistent, the following provisions shall apply:

7.4.1 Post Office shall have the right to conduct, and require Fujitsu Services to co-
operate and assist with, a tender process for the sub-contracting by Fujitsu
Services of the Operational Service in relation to which the ARL failure has
occurred to an alternative service provider (the “Service Provider”). If the
Parties agree that it would be more appropriate for Fujitsu Services to conduct,
and Post Office to co-operate and assist with, the tender process, then the
Parties shall procure the same.

7.4.2 Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, Fujitsu Services shall
disclose to any bona fide potential Service Provider (subject to the same
executing an Agreed Form NDA or any other form of non-disclosure agreement

mutually agreed by Post Office, Fujitsu Service and such bona fide potential

reasonably required to enable any potential Service Provider to prepare a
reasonably detailed tender proposal

If the outcome of any such tender process is that if Fujitsu Service were to sub-
contract the Operational Service in question to a Service Provider identified in
the tender process, the performance in respect of the failed ARL for that
Operational Service would be improved then Post Office shall have the right to
require Fujitsu Services to sub-contract such Operational Service to such
Service Provider at no higher cost to Post Office than was previously the case.

INTRODUCTION

The SLTs for the following Operational Services are specified in this Annex 1 to
Schedule 15:

1.1.1. Engineer Service;
1.1.2 Horizon System Helpdesk Service.
In respect of each of the above Operational Services:

1.2.1 the SLTs with associated LDTs, and (if any) the ARLs, are described in
paragraph 2 of this Annex 1; and

1.2.2 the SLTs with no associated LDTs, and in relation to which no liquidated
damages or other express contractual remedy is payable are set out in
paragraph 3 of this Annex.

For the purposes of the SLTs and LDTs set out in paragraph 2 of this Annex 1:

1.3.1 calls made to the Help Desk to report the non-availability of the NBS at a
Branch which on analysis are determined to be as a result of failure in the Local
Loop shall count as Priority B Help Desk calls. For the purposes of calculating
liquidated damages in paragraph 2.1.4 such calls shall be deemed to have
caused Downtime at all Counter Positions in the affected Branches; and

1.3.2 all timing measurements for Service Level purposes in respect of calls left on
the HSH Voicemail Service shall commence at 08:00 hours on the HSH Day
following that call.

Fujitsu Services shall be entitled to suspend a Help Desk call for reasons which shall
include the time that the call is with British Telecom for action, provided there is
evidence of management controls and checks on British Telecom by Fujitsu Services
during this suspension

Counter Positions in Branch * 0.81 pence);

Priority B

Where at least one Counter Position in a Local Branch, but not all,
experiences Downtime > 10 hours (Local)

Downtime cost =

((Seconds of Branch Downtime - (10 * 3600)) * number of automated
Counter Positions affected in Branch * 0.81 pence),

Where at least one Counter Position in an Intermediate Branch, but not
all, experiences Downtime > 15 hours (Intermediate):

Downtime cost =

((Seconds of Branch Downtime - (15 * 3600)) * number of automated
Counter Positions affected in Branch * 0.81 pence),

Where at least one Counter Position in a Remote Branch, but not all,
experiences Downtime > 24 hours (Remote):

Downtime cost =

2.1.3.4 For the purposes of paragraph 2.1.3.3 above, in relation to each AP
Client serviced by the APS via the EDG:

(a) the Transaction record file shall be deemed to be delivered
when it is delivered to the EDG and not the AP Client; and

(b) a successful Transaction record file delivery will be deemed to
have occurred when the file transfer software running on the
remote file transfer management service (FTMS) gateway
identifies that a successful transfer to the EDG has occurred or
cannot occur because of problems within the EDG
infrastructure.

2.1.4 Remedies

2.1.4.1 The liquidated damages for late delivery of APS Transaction
Data Files shall be calculated when the relevant LDT is

Day D)) / 100) * (total number of Transactions - any also failing at Day
J)* 1.15 pence) +

(((97.5 - actual level of Service by Day C) / 100) * (total number of
Transactions - any also failing at Day D and Day J) * 1.15 pence) +

NBS SERVICE LEVEL PRINCIPLES

This Part A of Annex 3 to Schedule 15 specifies the SLTs and ARLs and the
performance measurements required in respect of them for the NBS. No LDTs are
specified for the NBS in this Annex, but liquidated damages shall be payable by Fujitsu
Services in accordance with paragraph 3 and 4 of this Annex 3.

For the purposes of this Annex 3:

“ADSL Congestion Measure” means the proportion (expressed as a percentage) of
the samples taken each day where the measured available bandwidth is less than twice
the Guaranteed Minimum ADSL Bandwidth (such sampling and measurement to be

carried out in accordance with paragraph 1.6.1 of this Annex 3);

“Availability Period” means each period of 6 months commencing on 1 January and 1
July each SLT Calendar Year:

“Central NB System” means the elements of the NB System which enable on-line
Banking Transactions to be carried out, excluding all:

1.2.1. such elements in Branches (or other Post Office locations where the NBS is
available);

1.2.2. network components between each Branch (or other Post Office locations where
the NBS is available) and the Data Centres; and

1.2.3 network components between the Data Centres and the Banks;

“Core NB System Fault” means a fault in the Central NB System which causes the
NBS not to be available in any one or more Branches for the period that fault persists;

“Customer Critical Exception” means a NB Priority Exception in respect of which
Fujitsu Services has received a Disputed Banking Transaction Notice;

“Dial Round Connection” means a metered network connection to an Branch
established when a Fixed Connection cannot be established due to network congestion;

“FRIACO Congestion Measure” means the proportion (expressed as a percentage) of
the total time each day that Branches are scheduled to have Fixed Connections

Schedule 15 Annex 3 Part: A Version 7.0

CONFIDENTIAL

established (as governed by the allocation of Branches between the Silver FRIACO
Daytime and Silver Daytime ISDN categories and calculated by adding together the
periods of Fixed Connection time scheduled in each Branch, and then totalled for all
Branches) that Dial Round Connections are established instead;

“Guaranteed Minimum ADSL Bandwidth” means 11.5Kbits/s for branches using a
50:1 ADSL contention ratio and 28.8Kbits/s for Branches using a 20:1 ADSL contention
ratio;

“Non NB Core Hours’ means all hours which are not NB Core Hours.

The Service Levels described in this Annex 3 relate to the performance of the NBS
within the NBS Service Boundaries as measured at the points and/or in the manner
described in this Schedule.

NB Initial Period

1.4.1. During the NB Initial Period, Fujitsu Services’ obligations in respect of the
Service Levels (SLTs and ARLs) set out in paragraphs 2.1 to 2.4 (inclusive) of
this Annex 3 shall be limited to using reasonable endeavours to achieve those
thresholds and reporting Fujitsu Services’ performance against those thresholds
in the Service Review Book. Post Office shall not be entitled to liquidated
damages or any other right or remedy provided for under this Agreement in
respect of any failure by Fujitsu Services to achieve those Service Levels during
the Initial Period, and Fujitsu Services performance in respect of those Service
Levels during the Initial Period shall be disregarded for the purposes of
assessment of liquidated damages and any other rights or remedies provided
for under this Agreement which may be due to Post Office after that period. For
the avoidance of doubt, other than as specifically set out in this paragraph 1.4.1,
nothing in this paragraph 1.4.1 shall operate to restrict Post Office's rights in the
event of any failure by Fujitsu Services to meet its obligations under this
Agreement during the NB Initial Period.

1.4.2 Subject to paragraph 1.4.1, no SLTs or ARLs described in this Annex 3 shall
apply to the NBS until the first complete Service Level Measurement Period
following NBS Acceptance.

All calculations (including percentages and averages) upon which the SLTs, ARLs or
other targets in this Schedule are based shall be calculated, and Fujitsu Services’
performance assessed, for the relevant Service Level Measurement Period or
Availability Period as a whole. Without prejudice to that calculation and assessment,
Fujitsu Services’ performance against the Service Levels in this Annex 3 shall be
reported monthly for service monitoring purposes in the Service Review Book.

ADSL AND FRIACO Congestion Measures

1.6.1 For the purposes of the ADSL Congestion Measure:

FUJ00000083
FUJ00000083
CONFIDENTIAL

1.6.2

1.6.3

1.6.1.1 Fujitsu Services shall sample all parts of the Branch estate at least once
per hour during NB Core Hours;

1.6.1.2 samples which fail to record available bandwidth shall not be included in
the ADSL Congestion Measure; and

1.6.1.3 the Parties shall agree by the date set out in row 34 of Schedule 12 for
the implementation of ADSL in Branches (such agreement not to be
unreasonably withheld) a method of measurement of available
bandwidth which discounts reductions in bandwidth which do not arise
as a result of increases in the number of simultaneous users of ADSL.

Fujitsu Services shall procure that the Guaranteed Minimum ADSL Bandwidth is
available to Branches using ADSL during NB Core Hours. Fujitsu Services shall
ensure that Branches have a reasonable and proportionate share of the
bandwidth that is shared with third party users of ADSL..

For the purposes of assessing whether Fujitsu Services shall have achieved the
Service Levels (SLTs, ARLs and, for the purposes of this paragraph, reasonable
endeavours targets) set out in paragraphs 2.1 and 2.3 of this Annex 3:

1.6.3.1 the performance measurements (“Threshold Measurements”) in
respect of those Service Levels which relate to:

(a) Fixed Connections or Dialled Connections shall be disregarded for
each day upon which the FRIACO Congestion Measure
exceeds 10%; and

(b) ADSL Connections shall be disregarded for each day upon which
the ADSL Congestion Measure exceeds 10%,

each such day being referred to in this paragraph as a “CM Day”, and

1.6.3.2 in respect of each CM Day which follows after the occurrence of 13 of
the same days of the week upon which the FRIACO Congestion
Measure or the ADSL Congestion Measure (as appropriate in respect of
that CM Day) shall have been less than or equal to 10%:

(a) the average Threshold Measurement for those 13 days shall be
used instead of the actual Threshold Measurements on that CM
Day, and thereafter

(b) for each subsequent CM Day which falls on the same day of the
week, the average Threshold Measurement for the 13 most
recent days, which are the same day of the week, upon which
either:

Schedule 15 Annex 3 Part: A Version 7.0

Page 37 of 64

FUJ00000083

« the FRIACO Congestion Measure or ADSL Congestion
Measure (as appropriate) was less than or equal to 10%, or
e the actual Threshold Measurements have been replaced
with average Threshold Measurements in accordance with
(a) above,
shall be used instead of the actual Threshold Measurements
disregarded on that CM Day.
1.6.4 If the condition for replacement of the actual Threshold Measurements on a CM

1.6.5

1.6.6

Day by an average measure as set out in paragraph 1.6.3.2 of this Annex 3 is
not satisfied, then the actual Threshold Measurements for each such CM Day
shall be disregarded in accordance with paragraph 1.6.3.1 without replacement
by an average value.

If, in any Service Level Measurement Period, more than 30 CM Days occur
upon which the condition for replacement of the actual Threshold
Measurements on that CM Day by an average measure as set out in paragraph
1.6.3.2 of this Annex 3 is not satisfied, Fujitsu Services shall not be obliged to
achieve the Service Levels set out in paragraph 2.1 and 2.3 of this Annex 3
during that Service Level Measurement Period.

For the purpose of the reports referred to in paragraph 1.5 of this Annex 3 in
respect of the Service Levels and targets referred to in paragraphs 2.1 and 2.3
of this Annex 3, Fujitsu Services shall report:

1.6.6.1 the relevant averages and/or percentages based upon actual service
measurements;

1.6.6.2 the actual FRIACO Congestion Measure for each day that the FRIACO
Congestion Measure exceeded 10%; and

1.6.6.3 the actual ADSL Congestion Measure for each day that the ADSL
Congestion Measure exceeded 10%.

The adjustments required to reflect the replacement of actual measurements on
CM Days with average measures in accordance with paragraph 1.6.3.2 shall be
made at the end of each Service Level Measurement Period and reflected in the
report for that period.

1.7 The architecture of the NB System shall be capable of supporting Banking Transactions
(in accordance with applicable Service Levels) carried out in each Branch during the
hours that Branch is actually open for business, except during the period from 2000 to
0800 each 24 hour period when Banking Transactions shall not be able to be carried out
in Branches due to system management activities (including the introduction of major
Releases in accordance with paragraph 3.5.1 of the CCD entitled “Service Management

distribution, continuity tests and Reference Data update and such other activities as the
parties may agree). Such periods shall be scheduled by agreement with Post Office in
accordance with current practices used in respect of the Applications (other than the
NBS) and the Infrastructure Services, such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld.

For the purposes of the NBS, in particular the NBS Service Levels described in this
Annex 3 to Schedule 15, the result of the following calculation:

¢ MCWP minus MAAWP,

(such result being referred to in this paragraph 1.8 as the “NB Additional Time”) shall
not be less than 15 seconds. Once set, or as otherwise specified in the CCD entitled
“NBS Definition” (BP/SPE/035), changes to the MCWP and/or MAAWP where the
resulting MCWP is less than or equal to 40 seconds and where the resulting NB
Additional Time is more than or equal to 15 seconds shall be subject to change under
Operational Business Change (as applicable in respect of product change), and
changes where the resulting MCWP is greater than 40 seconds and/or the resulting NB
Additional Time is less than 15 seconds shall be subject to agreement under the Hard
Change Control Procedure.

This Annex 3 sets out five categories of performance measures:

1.9.1 NB Request and NB Authorisation transmission time measures;

1.9.2 NBS availability measures;

1.9.3 NBS reliability measures; and

1.9.4 Data Reconciliation Service measures.

Of these, paragraphs 1.9.1, 1.9.2 and 1.9.3 above are subject to liquidated damages
whilst paragraph 1.9.4 is not.

PERFORMANCE MEASURES,

NB Request and NB Authorisation transmission times

2.1.1. Banking Transactions referred to in this paragraph 2.1 shall be those for which a
NB Request is generated and a corresponding NB Authorisation is received
from the Banks before the earliest of:
2.1.1.1 the MCWP has expired;
2.1.1.2 the Banking Transaction is Declined by the Clerk; and

2.1.1.3 the Banking Transaction fails,

(a) the network communications between the Data Centres and the
switches used by Fujitsu Services (or Fujitsu Services' sub-
contractor which operates that network) to:

(1) answer ISDN calls from Branches; or

(2) to convert asynchronous transfer mode (ATM)
communications from ADSL Branches into internet
protocol (IP) communications,

(the “Central Network”); and
(b) the Alliance & Leicester Circuit.

For the purposes of measuring the time the Alliance & Leicester Circuit
is available, periods when that link is closed down pursuant to
the provisions of the CCD entitled “Closure of Associated NBS
Links” (CS/PRO/163) or by agreement of the Parties shall be
excluded.

2.2.2.2 The Service Level Target for the Central Network in each SLT Calendar
Year is that:

¢ Network Availability shall be greater than or equal to <B2.4.1> .

2.2.2.3 The Service Level Target for the Alliance & Leicester Circuit in each
SLT Calendar Year is that:

«Network Availability shall be greater than or equal to <B2.4.2>, as
adjusted from time to time to maintain the same availability measure
as that provided to Fujitsu Services by the relevant Subcontractor
(currently Energis Communications Limited).

2.2.2.4 Fujitsu Services shall use reasonable endeavours to procure availability
(as a defined service level from the relevant Sub-contractor (currently
Energis Communications Limited)), at least as good as the Network
Availability SLT for the Central Network, for that part of the NBS
communications network between the switches referred to in paragraph
2.2.2.1(a) and the digital subscriber line access multiplexors (DSLAMs)
at the British Telecom local exchanges that handle the ADSL
communications from Branches. Having secured such Service Level,

24 Data Reconciliation Service measures

2.41

2.4.2

Fujitsu Services shall measure the time taken to resolve each NB Priority
Exception, counting time within MSU Days only, as follows:

2.4.1.1 Where no Disputed Banking Transaction Notice has been received by
Fujitsu Services and a Banking Transaction persists in system state
category number 4 or 12 as set out in the CCD entitled “Network
Banking End to End Reconciliation Reporting” (CS/SPE/011), such
measurement shall commence at 0800 on the second MSU Day
following receipt by the DRSH of the corresponding C4 Confirmation or
D Message (as applicable).

2.4.1.2 Where a Disputed Banking Transaction Notice is received by Fujitsu
Services and a corresponding C4 Confirmation or D Message has been
received by the DRSH prior to the day of receipt of that Disputed
Banking Transaction Notice, such measurement shall commence at the
time of receipt of the Disputed Banking Transaction Notice (but not if
already commenced in accordance with (a) above, in which case (a)
shall apply).

2.4.1.3 Where a Disputed Banking Transaction Notice is received by Fujitsu
Services and a corresponding C4 Confirmation or D Message is
received by the DRSH on the same day as that Disputed Banking
Transaction Notice or on a subsequent day, such measurement shall
commence at 0800 on the next MSU Day following receipt of that C4
Confirmation or D Message (as applicable).

In each case above the NB Priority Exception shall be deemed resolved and
measurement shall stop at the time Fujitsu Services sends information to Post
Office sufficient to enable Post Office to settle that exception with the relevant
Bank, as described in the CCD entitled “On Line Services Reconciliation and
Incident Management” (NB/PRO/002)

In respect of each NB Priority Exception where Fujitsu Services requires:
2.4.2.1 information from, or access to a Branch; or
2.4.2.2 information from the Post Office regarding Banks,

for that exception to be resolved, the following shall not count towards the time
for resolution of that exception:

2.4.2.3 the period, if any, during which Fujitsu Services is unable to contact (by
telephone or other method agreed by the Parties) the Branch in
question or the Post Office regarding Banks in order to request that

reasonable endeavours to make such contact; and

2.4.2.4 the period, if any, whilst Fujitsu Services waits for that information or
access to be provided by the Branch in question or the Post Office
regarding Banks, having requested it, provided that Fujitsu Services has
repeated such request at reasonably frequent intervals.

The discounting of the periods described in 2.4.2.3 and 2.4.2.4 above shall be
subject to Fujitsu Services providing reports to Post Office setting out the
reasons for discounting any such periods from the resolution time for a NB
Priority Exception and the duration of such periods.

In respect of each Disputed Banking Transaction Notice, Fujitsu Services shall
continue to check on each MSU Day following that notice whether a
corresponding C4 Confirmation or D Message has been received until either a
Customer Critical Exception arises and is resolved or Fujitsu Services and Post
Office agree alternative action.

For the purposes of paragraph 2.4 of this Annex 3:
2.4.4.1 “day” means a period running for 24 hours from 00:00; and

2.4.4.2 a C4 Confirmation or D Message received on a day by the DRSH after
21:30 on that day shall be deemed to have been received the next day.

The Service Level Target set out in paragraph 2.4.6 of this Annex 3 shall apply
in respect of:

2.4.5.1 all Customer Critical Exceptions; and

2.4.5.2 the first 500 NB Priority Exceptions (other than Customer Critical
Exceptions) occurring on each day (excluding those described in
paragraph 2.4.5.3),

but shall not apply in respect of

2.4.5.3 NB Priority Exceptions (other than Customer Critical Exceptions) arising
from a common cause, in each case where the number of NB Priority
Exceptions arising from such common cause is greater than 100.

The Service Level Target is that:

e the resolution time (measured in accordance with paragraphs 2.4.1 and

2.4.2 of this Annex 3) for <B4.1> % of the NB Priority Exceptions specified
in paragraph 2.4.5 of this Schedule 15 shall not exceed 8 hours.

responsible (including, without limit, those connections relating to CAPO
and LINK which Post Office are responsible for pursuant to paragraph
4.4 of Schedule 17).

The SLT for the connection between each NB Authorisation Agent and each PI
is that the number of instances in which any of those connections are
unavailable for two minutes or more in any calendar month of each SLT
Calendar Year shall not exceed:

2.5.2.1 <B5.1>, in respect of each NB Authorisation Agent to PI connection
relating to the same Bank which are unavailable in that month; or

2.5.2.2 <B5.2>, in respect of each NB Authorisation Agent to PI connection
relating to different Banks which are unavailable in that month.

The Service Level Measurement Period for this SLT will be a period of 6 months
commencing on 1 January and 1 July of each SLT Calendar Year.

Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this paragraph 2.5 but subject
to paragraph 2.5.4, Fujitsu Services shall use reasonable endeavours to ensure
that the number of instances in which the above connections are unavailable for
one minute or more in any calendar month of each SLT Calendar Year shall not

3.1.2.2 the amount recoverable under paragraph 3.1.7.1 as liquidated
damages for any failures of the ARLs corresponding to those SLTs.

In respect of each Availability Period the liquidated damages payable by Fujitsu
Services under this Annex 3 shall equal the sum of Remedies(Availability1) and
Remedies(Availability2) as referred to in paragraph 3.4 for that period.

In addition to the sums referred to in paragraphs 3.1.2 and 3.1.3 of this Annex 3
Fujitsu Services shall also pay liquidated damages calculated as set out in
paragraph 4 of this Annex 3.

The total cumulative sums payable by Fujitsu Services under this paragraph 3
of this Annex 3 shall not exceed £2,000,000 (two million pounds) per Financial
Year and the aggregate limit on Fujitsu Services' liability set out in Clause
32.2.3 shall apply to any sums paid by Fujitsu Services under this paragraph 3
of this Annex 3.

PART B - DEBIT CARD SERVICE LEVELS AND REMEDIES

Payment File Delivery

Fujitsu Services’ obligations regarding transmission of Payment Files (as that term is
defined in the CCD entitled “DC MoP Functional Description” (EF/SER/001)) to the MA
shall be as specified in the CCD entitled “DC MoP Functional Description”
(EF/SER/001). In the event that an attempt to transmit a Payment File to the MA in
accordance with that CCD fails then those provisions shall be supplemented by
paragraph 5.2.

Where Fujitsu Services attempts to transmit a Payment File to the MA and the attempt
is unsuccessful Fujitsu Services shall be required to make one further attempt to
transmit that file to the MA on that day. If such further attempt fails, Fujitsu Services
shall report the same to the Post Office. Thereafter, Fujitsu Services shall provide such
assistance and co-operation as set out in the Working Document entitled “DC
Operational Level Agreement” for the purposes of procuring the transmission of that
Payment File to the MA as soon as reasonably practicable.

In the event that the process specified in paragraph 5.2 above has been followed by
Fujitsu Services, no payment of liquidated damages (as specified in paragraph 5.4
below) will be payable by Fujitsu Services due to the relevant Payment File not reaching
the MA.

Subject to paragraph 5.3 above, in the event that a Payment File is not received by the
MA by the time specified for such in the CCD entitled “Horizon Streamline Application
Interface Specification” (EF/IFS/002) on the day after creation of the Payment File,
liquidated damages will be payable by Fujitsu Services to Post Office, by Fujitsu
Services issuing Post Office with a credit note, as soon as reasonably practicable
following the day on which the MA receives the Payment File. Such liquidated damages
(to be applied by way of credit) will be calculated in accordance with the following
formula:

Liquidated damages per Payment File not received as stated above (£) =

{(X x Y)/365} x Z where:

X = __ the value (pounds sterling) of the relevant Payment File;

Y= the figure (expressed as a percentage) representing the base rate of Barclays
Bank Plc (prevailing on the day the Payment File is required to be delivered (as
specified in the CCD entitled “Horizon Streamline Application Interface

Specification ” (ER/IFS/002)) plus 3 per cent.; and

z= the number of days from and including the date after creation of the Payment
File until and including the day on which the MA receives the Payment File.

6.1.6 “Relevant Data” has the meaning give to that term in paragraph 6.3 below.

6.2 In the event a DC Exception arises solely as a result of the acts or omissions of Fujitsu
Services, Fujitsu Services shall send to Post Office a BIMS Report in accordance with
the CCD entitled “On Line Services Reconciliation and Incident Management”
(NB/PRO/002).

6.3 Fujitsu Services shall include in the BIMS Report submitted pursuant to paragraph 6.2
above the Merchant ID, the Card Number, Transaction Amount, Transaction Code and
Transaction Date for the DC Exception in question. In addition, save in respect of each

6.5.2 the circumstances specified in sub-paragraphs 6.4.1 or 6.4.2 above have not
arisen; and

6.5.3 Post Office itself obtains the Relevant Data directly from the Branch,

Fujitsu Services shall pay Post Office the sum of £278.57 (representing Post Office's
costs of obtaining the Relevant Data and effecting manual settlement).

In respect of each DC Exception Reimbursement, Fujitsu Services shall pay to Post
Office an amount equal to the sum of the DC Transaction Value and £98.56.

Save where paragraph 6.5 applies (in which event the provisions of this paragraph 6.7
shall not apply), for each DC Exception (other than a DC Exception Reimbursement)
Fujitsu Services shall (provided manual settlement has been effected) pay to Post Office
the lesser of (i) £98.56 and (ii) the sum specified from time to time in the CCD entitled
“On Line Services Reconciliation and Incident Management” (NB/PRO/002) in respect
of Post Office's costs of effecting manual settlement.

Save in respect of a DC Exception Reimbursement, in the event that:

6.8.1 due solely to the acts or omissions of Fujitsu Services the BIMS Report referred
to in paragraph 6.2 is not delivered to Post Office within the time period (for the
purposes of avoiding “charge backs”) specified in the CCD entitled “On Line
Services Reconciliation and Incident Management” (NB/PRO/002) or the BIMS.
Report is delivered within that time period but it does not include the Relevant
Data in circumstances where Fujitsu Services is in Default of its obligation in
paragraph 6.3 above to obtain such Relevant Data or a payment is required to
be made to Post Office pursuant to paragraph 6.5 above; and

6.8.2 the Merchant Acquirer does not reimburse Post Office the DC Transaction
Value,

Fujitsu Services will reimburse Post Office the DC Transaction Value.

In the event that Fujitsu Services fails to deliver the BIMS Report on time pursuant to
paragraph 6.2 above or the BIMS Report is delivered on time but it does not include the
Relevant Data in circumstances where Fujitsu Services is in Default of its obligation in
paragraph 6.3 above to obtain such Relevant Data or a payment is required to be made
to Post Office pursuant to paragraph 6.5 above, it shall pay to Post Office liquidated
damages. The liquidated damages shall be calculated in accordance with the following
formula:

Liquidated damages (£) = (N x TV x Y) / 365

where:

N= _ the number of MSU Days, including the day the BIMS Report was due for delivery
pursuant to paragraph 6.2 above, that the BIMS Report is delivered late;

TV= the DC Transaction Value; and

Y= the figure (expressed as a percentage) representing the base rate of Barclays
Bank Plc (prevailing on the day the BIMS Report was due for delivery (as
specified in the CCD entitled “On Line Services Reconciliation and Incident
Management” (NB/PRO/002)) plus 3 per cent.

Post Office shall not be entitled to liquidated damages or any other right or remedy
provided for under this Agreement in respect of any failure by Fujitsu Services to
achieve its obligations specified in this paragraph 6 until expiry of the Measurement
Period Expiry Date, and Fujitsu Services' performance in respect of those obligations
before the Measurement Period Expiry Date shall be disregarded for the purposes of
assessment of liquidated damages and any other rights or remedies provided for under
this the Agreement which may be due to Post Office after that date.

The Parties acknowledge that the fundamental commercial assumptions underlying the

8. GENERAL INFRASTRUCTURE SERVICES REQUIREMENTS

8.1 Introduction

This section contains characteristics common to both the OPS and TMS Infrastructure
Services.

8.2 Links from OPS to TMS

8.2.1

8.2.2

General

8.2.1.1 Each instance of OPS within Branches shall interface with TMS to allow
the transfer, in both directions, of authorised data files and messages.

8.2.1.2 The transfer of data between OPS and TMS shall be secure, complete,
accurate and robust.

8.2.1.3 Within OPS it shall be possible for OPS to identify whether data from
OPS have been received by TMS or not.

Data Replication

8.2.2.1 Fujitsu Services shall use data replication and synchronisation
techniques to ensure that data transfer between Counter Positions at
which OPS is provided and between instances of OPS at each Counter
Position and the TMS are secure, complete, accurate and robust.

8.2.2.2 Once a Transaction has been settled at a Counter Position, TMS shall
commit the full Transaction details to that Counter Position PC's
message store. The Transaction details shall simultaneously be
automatically replicated to all other Counter Position PCs in the Branch
so that the data are securely captured. In addition, Fujitsu Services shall
automatically replicate Transaction details to a remote server at which
TMS is provided.

CONFIDENTIAL

8.2.2.3 The OPS Counter Position PCs and TMS servers are known as
"nodes".

8.2.2.4 All data and message transfers from a single node shall be generated in
a strict numbered sequence with a unique node identification. Any
attempt to introduce a fraudulent message shall be automatically
detected and rejected by OPS.

8.2.2.5 An additional pseudo random sequence number produced from a
cryptographic algorithm can also be included to provide a very high
level of message integrity as agreed between the Parties from time to
time, such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld. Details of the
use of the cryptographic algorithm are contained in the CCD entitled
"Security Functional Specification” (RS/FSP/001).

8.2.2.6 Data and message transfers shall be resilient to either network or node
failure. When the failure condition is resolved the nodes shall
automatically synchronise and complete any data or message transfers
that are required to ensure these nodes are in a consistent state.

Data Integrity

8.2.3.1 Fujitsu Services shall use techniques to ensure data integrity within the
OPS and as part of data/message transfer between OPS and TMS,
including:

(a) cyclic redundancy checks shall be calculated for all journal
records, including Reference Data;

(b) digital signatures shall be used for all data where assurance of
content and source are required; and

(c) data encryption used selectively on certain data fields.

8.2.3.2 All messages and data shall have a cyclic redundancy check applied
when they are initially committed to the journal and this shall be
checked every time the message or data is accessed. This shall protect
against accidental corruption and casual tampering. Any failure of a
cyclic redundancy check shall cause the message to be rejected and
retrieved from alternate nodes.

8.2.3.3 In the event that nodes fail, recovery shall take place through the use of
the following techniques: associating of Post Office and correspondence
server nodes, message numbering, marker (message high and low
water marks) exchange message transfers to equalise water marks,
and in accordance with the CCD entitled "Post Office Site Failure
Contingency Procedures".

Fujitsu Services shall apply a digital signature to the data prior to
transmission and shall then check it upon receipt. Digital signature
techniques and the data to which they are applied shall be described in
the CCD entitled "Security Functional Specification" (RS/FSP/001).

8.2.3.5 Fujitsu Services shall automatically detect any attempt to alter data and
shall log such attempts for subsequent investigation by Fujitsu Services.
Details of all such attempts shall be passed to Post Office.

8.2.4 Recovery

8.2.4.1 Fujitsu Services shall perform general recovery processes as specified
in the CCD entitled “Business Continuity Framework” (CS/SIP/002).

8.2.4.2 The Counter Position PC in all single Counter Position Branches shall
be fitted with a second hard disk which shall be exchangeable to
facilitate rapid exchange of systems and Transaction data in the event
of a system failure other than a hard disk failure.

8.3 PIN Pad Firmware Distribution

DEVELOPMENT SERVICES
41. INTRODUCTION
441 This Schedule 20 deals with Development Services as more specifically defined in

241

paragraph 2 below.

Development Services consist on the one hand of SI Support Services and on the other
hand of various services which are to be ordered through Work Orders.

This Schedule 20 sets out the Post Office's and Fujitsu Services’ agreed approach to
contracting for and resourcing Work Packages.

This Schedule does not deal with (and the Development Services do not include):

1.4.1 except as described in paragraph 2.1.2.4, the implementation of Branch
Hardware which is dealt with under Schedule 23; or

1.4.2 the subsequent operation of developed Applications and implemented Systems
which are dealt with under Schedule 19.

Where Post Office chooses to procure a standard or bespoke Application from Fujitsu
Services the terms on which it does so shall be set out in one or more Work Packages
in accordance with the process referred to in paragraphs 5 to 7 below.

It is the intention of both Parties that the most suitable procurement method shall be
used as the basis for contracting an individual Work Package.

DEVELOPMENT SERVICES
The following Services are referred to together as “Development Services”:

2.1.1 Sl Support Services (including Fourth Line Support and Fujitsu Services’
internal re-architecting projects).

2.1.2 Services which may be procured by Post Office as follows:
2.1.2.1 Professional Services

Professional services comprising the provision of consultancy and
technical advice by appropriately skilled Fujitsu Services personnel on a
T&M basis under the management of Post Office. Typical work would
include strategy, feasibility and requirements studies. Provision of such
services is separate from but relates to the services described in
paragraphs 2.1.2.2 to 2.1.2.4 below.

as defined by Post Office requirements in the relevant Work
Order.

2.1.2.4 Hardware Impact Assessment and Implementation Support (together
"Systems Implementation") as described under Schedule 23 but
procured under this Schedule 20.

Current Development Services

Current Development Services include additional functionality ordered by Post
Office prior to 1 January 2003 and which is being developed by Fujitsu
Services, including NBS and Debit Card.

APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT AND PROCUREMENT

Procurement principles

3.1.1

Where Post Office requires additional functionality to be integrated within the
Horizon Service Infrastructure, it will, wherever practicable and cost effective
(and subject to paragraph 3.2.2) provide such functionality by procuring
standard Applications from Fujitsu Services or a third party software provider in
preference to carrying out bespoke software development.

Where standard Applications are not available or not suitable, Post Office may:
3.1.2.1 procure a bespoke Application from a third party; or

3.1.2.2 procure a bespoke Application from Fujitsu Services.

4.2

3.2.1

If Post Office procures a standard or bespoke Application from a third party it
may require that such Application is integrated into the Horizon Service
Infrastructure by Fujitsu Services.

The selection and deployment of any third party standard Applications or third
party bespoke Applications is subject to joint:

3.2.2.1 verification of the Application’s technical compatibility and ability to
interface with the Horizon Service Infrastructure;

3.2.2.2 assessment of the impact on the Horizon Service Infrastructure
(including the costs of implementation) and the Operational Services
(including the Service Levels and any limitations on liability);

3.2.2.3 review of the availability of suitable support capability; and
3.2.2.4 assessment against Post Office IT and business strategies,
by Post Office and Fujitsu Services.

The verification, assessment and review activities referred to in paragraph 3.2.2
shall be subject to a Work Order.

The commercial and contractual relationship between the Post Office, Fujitsu
Services and any third party Application provider (including the charges payable
to Fujitsu Services) shall be agreed on a case by case basis. The Parties may
adopt whatever commercial and/or contractual structure is appropriate for the
particular circumstances. However, the commercial and contractual
arrangement must take reasonable account of the impact on the systems and
services provided to Post Office by Fujitsu Services.

Fujitsu Services shall not unreasonably refuse to integrate third party
Applications into the Horizon Service Infrastructure, taking into account the
proposed commercial terms and the impact such integration will have on the
systems and services provided to Post Office by Fujitsu Services.

SYSTEMS INTEGRATION AND SYSTEMS IMPLEMENTATION

Fujitsu Services shall, throughout the term of this Agreement, be the exclusive provider
to Post Office of Systems Integration and Systems Implementation services relating to
the Horizon Service Infrastructure as at 1 January 2003 and any replacement thereof
with similar functionality.

The terms on which Fujitsu Services supplies the services referred to in paragraph 4.1
shall be set out in one or more Work Orders in accordance with the process referred to
in paragraphs 5 to 8 of this Schedule.

the Horizon Service Infrastructure have been included in a Work Order placed
with Fujitsu Services,

Post Office shall appoint a party to provide such Systems Integration or Systems
Implementation services on a case by case basis and may carry out such work itself.

CONTRACTING FOR DEVELOPMENT SERVICES

SI Support Services and Current Development Services are provided under the terms of
this Agreement and are paid for through the Charges.

Development Services which fall within paragraph 2.1.2 must be ordered as Work
Orders. The basis for development resource planning of Work Packages shall be the
Development Process Stages (as such term is defined in paragraph 5.7). Each
Development Process Stage shall be the subject of one or more Work Packages. A
Work Package may cover:

5.2.1 all or part of a single Development Process Stage; or

5.2.2 all or parts of two or more consecutive Development Process Stages.

Post Office shall use all reasonable endeavours to arrange its ordering of Work Orders
such that workload is smoothed within each Financial Year of the term of this Agreement
and Fujitsu Services shall not unreasonably refuse to agree to Work Orders.

Except in the case of Development Services to be provided under paragraph 3.2.4,
where Development Services are to be provided under the terms of this Agreement the
terms of the relevant Work Order will be determined in accordance with one of the
IS Landscape ("ISL") approaches set out in paragraph 5.6.

The ISL is a generic approach to joint working between the Post Office and suppliers
(including Fujitsu Services) in relation to development services to support the solution
life cycle.

The ISL proposes two different development approaches:

5.6.1 Competitive ISL, which is described in paragraph 7; and

5.6.2 Joint Working ISL, which is described in paragraph 8.

Fujitsu Services and Post Office shall operate a standard development (“Development
Process”) for Development Services procured by Post Office from Fujitsu Services

under this Agreement. The Development Process is made up of six key stages (each
key stage being a “Development Process Stage”). The first two Development Process
Stages are common to both Competitive ISL and Joint Working ISL and are described in
paragraph 6.1. The third, fourth, fifth and sixth Development Process Stages are only
relevant to Joint Working ISL and are described in paragraph 8.4.

COMMON ISL

The following Development Process Stages will be led by Post Office who may procure
professional services from Fujitsu Services to support the work done in the relevant
Development Process Stage. These Development Process Stages will be common to
both Competitive ISL and Joint Working ISL and will normally be completed before Post
Office makes its decision as to whether any further Development Process Stages shall
be conducted as Joint Working ISL or Competitive ISL.

6.1.1. Strategic Approval Stage, which defines the strategic and architectural
framework within which the IS changes are to be developed and delivered.

6.1.2 Start-up and Feasibility Stage, in which Post Office develops an outline view of a
potential business requirement with input, where required, from Fujitsu Services
on the indicative cost range for the provision of a potential solution, to assist
Post Office in making an informed decision on:

6.1.2.1 the business case for proceeding to later stages of the Development
Process; and

6.1.2.2 sourcing of solution components.

A key objective of Common ISL is to provide sufficient information to Post Office such
that it can make an informed decision about the procurement approach to the next
stages of the Development Process in respect of a project as a whole and of each
solution component. The Parties shall consider jointly the procurement options by
reference to Schedule 23, paragraph 8.9 of this Schedule 20 and paragraph 6.2.2 of
Schedule 10 before a decision is made by Post Office on whether it will adopt
Competitive ISL or Joint Working ISL for the later Development Process Stages.

COMPETITIVE ISL

Where the development approach chosen by Post Office is Competitive ISL, the terms
on which any Development Services are provided by Fujitsu Services will be determined
through a competitive process. Post Office shall specify the requirements and
processes to be applied to such competitive procurement, dividing the tasks into Work
Packages and Fujitsu Services shall not unreasonably be refused an opportunity to
compete for each of the Work Packages by Post Office.

Post Office shall, with assistance from Fujitsu Services in relation to those Development
Process Stages awarded to Fujitsu Services under Competitive ISL, plan the stages
involved in such development work in order to achieve appropriate time to market that
may involve overlapping stages between Post Office and its suppliers, including Fujitsu
Services. However there shall be discrete decision points such that Fujitsu Services

8.3

shall be aware whether work undertaken in the current Development Process Stage
shall be followed by a competitive procurement in the next stage.

Competitive ISL cannot be used as the procurement process for those Development
Services to which Fujitsu Services has exclusive rights under paragraph 4.1.

Post Office may procure from Fujitsu Services the establishment of a test environment
for use by a third party developer, where required, as a specific Work Order at the rates
and charges set out in paragraph 6.2 of Schedule 10.

JOINT WORKING ISL

Joint Working ISL is a process involving overlapping stages of work enabling greater
sharing and inter-action between Post Office and Fujitsu Services, and thereby faster
time to market, than under the Competitive ISL approach. There will, however, still be a
need for clear decision points between each stage to enable control of the overall
process.

The principles applicable to Joint Working between Post Office and Fujitsu Services are
as follows:

8.2.1 clear control for each Development Process Stage and the responsibility to
deliver associated deliverables will be specified and agreed between the Parties
as vesting in either Post Office or Fujitsu Services but not both;

8.2.2 business control of Work Packages shall be established in accordance with the
governance principles set out in Schedules 4 and 9 and each large Work
Package will have a senior management sponsor within both Fujitsu Services
and Post Office; and

8.2.3 ISL related responsibilities shall be clearly identified and assigned to specific
individuals in Fujitsu Services or Post Office.

The Parties shall structure and operate the Joint Working ISL in order, so far as is
reasonably practical, to:

8.3.1. support quicker time to market, and minimise both the overall number of
development processes requiring sign-off and the number of steps required to
achieve such sign-off;

8.3.2 promote consistency, simplicity and clarity in both the development approach
and format of ISL deliverables;

8.3.3 consider the full solution life cycle, including post development and delivery
back-end functions such as Service Management;

8.3.4 operate in accordance with the governance framework described in Schedule 4;
and

8.4

8.5

8.6

87

8.3.5 reduce cost in the overall development process, in line with best practice and
the value for money assurances referred to in Schedule 11.

For Joint Working ISL, the Development Process will include the following key stages
(in addition to the two Development Process Stages described in paragraph 6.1):

8.4.1 Requirements Analysis Stage, in which production of a full specification of the
requirements and Work Packages is led by Post Office to form the basis for
solution specification and any subsequent contract for development,
implementation, acceptance and operational work.

8.4.2 Solution Specification Stage, in which Fujitsu Services produces (i) a Design
Proposal setting out the proposed solution in response to the Post Office's Work
Package requirements and (ii) Commercial Terms detailing the price and
contractual terms applicable to the subsequent stages of Development Process
Stages and any operational stage.

8.4.3 Solution Build and Test Stage, in which Fujitsu Services undertakes the
development, integration and testing of the solution Work Package up to, and
including, its acceptance by Post Office.

8.4.4 Implementation Stage, in which Fujitsu Services undertakes system and
software rollout into the live environment (any necessary Branch Hardware
Implementation having been carried out in accordance with Schedule 23),
together with related planning and change management, up to acceptance of
the solution into live service.

The Parties will operate the Development Process to maximise continuity between
Development Process Stages and to overlap Development Process Stages where
practical, particularly, but not limited to, overlap between the Requirements Analysis
Stage and Solution Specification Stage.

Any Development Process Stages which may be contracted for on the basis of
Competitive ISL, in accordance with the principles referred to in paragraph 7 of this
Schedule 20, shall be clearly identified as such by Post Office prior to the Requirements
Analysis Stage.

In default of agreement to the contrary:

8.7.1 Post Office shall be responsible for managing the Development Process Stages
referred to in paragraphs 6.1.1, 6.1.2 and 8.4.1, although Post Office may
procure Professional Services from Fujitsu Services to support these activities;

8.7.2 Fujitsu Services shall be responsible for managing the Development Process
Stages referred to in paragraphs 8.4.2, 8.4.3 and 8.4.4, (except for any aspects
of the Implementation Stage which are performed by a third party in accordance
with the provisions of Schedule 23); and

8.7.3 Post Office shall be responsible for Post Office related business implementation
aspects of the Implementation Stage.

8.8

Where any work related to a Development Process Stage is to be undertaken by Fujitsu
Services, it shall be initiated by a Work Order.

8.9 Where the scope and size of a Work Package are substantial,
Post Office may request Fujitsu Services to identify as separable
components of work individual Work Package Element (each a
“Subcontract Work Package Element”) which could be carried out by
third parties under Fujitsu Services’ management. Where this option
is considered, Fujitsu Services will identify any liability, performance,
reliability or other potential service implications of such option and the
terms to be incorporated into a subcontract for such work.

Where Fujitsu Services undertakes work falling within the Development Process Stages
referred to in paragraphs 8.4.2, 8.4.3 and 8.4.4 under the Joint Working ISL the
following development documentation shall be produced for the purposes of those

stages:

8.10.1

8.10.2

8.10.3

a Conceptual Design which incorporates the Post Office's business and
technical requirements and which defines the Work Packages required. If the
Conceptual Design is produced by Post Office it will be owned, subject to
Clause 13.17.2 by Post Office. If the Conceptual Design is produced by Fujitsu
Services as Developed Documentation:

8.10.1.1 ownership of the Intellectual Property Rights in that Conceptual
Design shall be as set out in Clause 13.15; and

8.10.1.2 subject to paragraph 8.10.1.1, to facilitate Post Office's ownership of
such intellectual Property Rights and so far as reasonably practicable
given the subject matter of that Conceptual Design, Fujitsu Services
will not incorporate into the Conceptual Design any pre-existing
material in which the Intellectual Property Rights are owned by the
Fujitsu Services Group and, if so requested by Post Office, shall
remove any such material prior to acceptance by post Office of that
Conceptual Design.

a Design Proposal owned by Fujitsu Services which sets out Fujitsu Services’
proposed solution design; and

Commercial Terms, produced by Fujitsu Services, which will specify the costs,
contractual conditions, including any Post Office responsibilities, and any
exceptions to or qualifications in respect of the Post Office Work Package
requirements specified within the Conceptual Design.

The Parties shall set out the approach to and general format, content and level of detail
of both the Conceptual Design and the Design Proposal in a CCD to be agreed between
the Parties by 31 March 2003. The following high-level principles shall form the basis of
such document:

Not Used;
use reasonable endeavours to promote continuity of work flow;

synchronise Post Office business approval processes with
Development Process Stage checkpoints;

provide that, so far as is commercially acceptable to Post Office,
each Development Process Stage will continue into the start of the
next Development Process Stage whilst next stage approvals are
being procured (the aim of this requirement being to eliminate
programme stop/start and hence provide for continuity of
resourcing);

in principle, limit number of iterations around requirements definition
to no more than three.

8.12 Documentation requirements shall be confined to those commissioned by Post Office
and those otherwise required by Fujitsu Services for its own purposes.

8.12.1 With respect to documentation commissioned by Post Office:

8.12.11

8.12.1.2

8.12.13

Post Office shall ensure that there shall be a single review group
which reviews each draft concurrently;

in principle, there shall be no more than two comment cycles; and

Post Office shall consolidate its comments under an informed
sponsor.

9.3.1 Post Office may commission Fujitsu Services to produce specially
commissioned design documentation for one or more Design Purposes
(“Specially Commissioned Design Documentation”).

9.3.2 Fujitsu Services warrants that such Specially Commissioned Design
Documentation shall be produced by appropriately qualified, experienced and
trained personnel with all due skill, care and diligence taking into account good
industry practice and their previous roles within Fujitsu Services relevant to the
subject matter of this Agreement, but any other implied warranties are excluded
to the fullest extent permitted at law.

DEVELOPMENT RESOURCE MANAGEMENT

Core SI Team

10.1.1 Fujitsu Services shall maintain a core systems integration team (the “Core SI
Team”).

10.1.2 The Core SI Team shall initially contain an average (measured over a Financial
Year) of 150 individuals, and shall comprise management, programme office,
requirements analysis, architecture & design, Systems Integration,
development, quality assurance, testing and support, and configuration
management skills. The initial Core SI Team is described, in terms of skill units
and skill sets within skill unit, in Part A of the Resource Plan, a preliminary
version of which is set out at Annex 1 (such version applying at the Amendment
Date).

Service's discretion taking due account of the constraints and objectives set out
in paragraph 10.2.

From 1 April 2005 the Core SI Team shall reduce to 90 persons.

10.2.1

10.2.2

10.2.3

10.2.4

10.2.5

10.2.6

The composition of the Core SI Team is and will remain such that there will be a
degree of Pre-paid SI Capacity remaining once the Core SI Team has
performed the SI Support Services. The amount of the Pre-paid SI Capacity
from time to time is defined in paragraphs 11.7.2. Such Pre-paid SI Capacity
will be calculated without reference to the positions within the Core SI Team
(initially 20) which are dedicated to the provision of indirect services and are
designated in Part A of the Resource Plan from time to time as ‘programme
Office’ and ‘senior management’) It is the intention of the Parties to utilise that
Pre-paid SI Capacity, to the extent practical, in the performance of Work
Packages.

The degree to which such Pre-paid SI Capacity is capable of being effectively
applied to Work Packages will depend upon:

10.2.2.1 the appropriateness of the skills possessed by the Core SI Team to
work which is outside the scope of the Services and Applications (both
as at the Amendment Date); and

10.2.2.2 the extent to which effective utilisation can be achieved through
planning in advance so as to achieve a smoothing of demand.

To address the issue in paragraph 10.2.2.1, and subject to the Core SI Team
retaining the appropriate balance of skills and resources necessary to perform
the SI Support Services, the composition of the Core SI Team shall be designed
to the extent reasonably possible to match anticipated Work Package demand
from the Post Office as identified in the Resource Plan.

To address the issue in paragraph 10.2.2.2, the Parties shall plan resource
utilisation in the manner set out in paragraphs 10.4 to 10.6.

In addition Fujitsu Services has agreed to underwrite a degree of utilisation as
set out in paragraph 11.

Basic skills training (e.g. programming languages) to enable staff to resource
Work Packages is Fujitsu Services’ responsibility and time spent on such basic
training shall not be treated as utilising Pre-paid SI Capacity. Fujitsu Services
shall decide upon training requirements for staff in the Core SI Team.

Notwithstanding the measures referred to in paragraphs 10.2.3 and 10.2.4
Work Packages may require appropriate additional development resources in
excess of the resources available from the Core SI Team (“Additional
Resources”) in order to provide the appropriate amount of suitably skilled effort
to fulfil demand.

Fujitsu Services shall, as required by Work Orders and subject to the provisions
of paragraph 10.5, procure Additional Resources and shall subsequently shed
such Additional Resources as the level of Work Order demand reduces.

Further to paragraph 8.9, Post Office may designate an appropriate and
qualified third party to carry out Subcontract Work Package Elements, and
Fujitsu Services in its capacity as systems integrator shall not act unreasonably
in seeking to agree appropriate terms with the third party and with Post Office

Necessary induction training for Additional Resources on the Horizon Service
Infrastructure shall be included in the relevant Work Package, and Fujitsu
Services shall procure that such resources have the requisite basic skills
required for that work.

Resource Planning Process

10.4.1

10.4.2

10.4.3

Fujitsu Services shall propose, based on Post Office's declared forecasts of
demand, a resource plan (the "Resource Plan"), over a planning period (the
“Planning Period") comprising the current Work Period (defined in paragraph
10.4.4) and the subsequent twelve Work Periods. The Resource Plan shall
comprise three elements:

10.4.1.1 the resources which are committed to SI Support Services;

10.4.1.2 the resources which are to be applied to fulfilling Work Orders (the
"Work Order Resource Plan"), comprising Core SI Team resources
and the Additional Resources agreed in relation to Work Orders;
and

10.4.1.3 the resources which would be required to fulfil anticipated (but not
committed) Work Packages (collectively, the "Uncommitted
Resource Plan").

Fujitsu Services shall update and extend the Resource Plan, and Fujitsu
Services and Post Office shall work together to agree it, in line with the resource
review meetings described in paragraph 10.6 below and subject to the
governance arrangements set out in Schedule 4.

Fujitsu Services shall commit Development Services resources on the basis of
the Work Order Resource Plan.

amounts agreed in the Work Order in question which unless otherwise agreed
shall be on the basis of the time and materials man rates set out in paragraph
6.2 of Schedule 10.

Subject to Post Office following the joint development resource planning
process described in paragraph 10.4, and subject also to paragraph 10.5.6,
Fujitsu Services shall procure appropriate Additional Resources for anticipated
Work Orders, providing that such Work Order is received by the date specified

10.6.2 Resource Review Meetings shall take place two weeks after the end of each
Work Period. Exceptionally, the first Resource Review Meeting shall take place
within the period specified in Schedule 12.

10.6.3 The Demand Planning Forum shall carry out reviews on a 6 month basis to
consider the alignment of Core SI Team Skill Sets with the skills required to
perform their support functions and intended Work Packages and agree what
actions may be required to establish a different balance for the future.

UNDERWRITTEN UTILISATION OF THE CORE SI TEAM

The Charges include a charge, the “SI Commitment Fee”, in respect of the Core SI
Team which is set out in paragraph 4 of Schedule 10.

The charge referred to in paragraph 11.1 was calculated on the basis that the maximum
number of man days that the Core SI Team would devote to Work Packages in any
Work Period is the Periodic Pre-paid SI Capacity for that Work Period calculated in
accordance with paragraph 11.7.4.

In addition Post Office is obliged to pay for Additional Resources in accordance with
paragraph 10.5.1 of this Schedule 20 by way of the Additional SI Charges.

The Additional SI Charges payable by Post Office may be subject to rebate pursuant to
paragraph 11.9.

At the Resource Review Meeting held following each Work Period Fujitsu Services shall
present to Post Office records showing in respect of that Work Period:

11.5.1 the number of hours actually devoted to SI Support Services by the Core S!
Team;

11.5.2 the Work Packages on which work was carried out;

11.5.3. the number of hours, analysed by skill unit, grade and Work Package, which
were devoted to those Work Packages by the Core SI Team;

11.5.4 the number of hours, analysed by skill unit, grade and Work Package, which
were devoted to those Work Packages by Additional Resources; and

11.5.5 the number of hours of Additional Resources for which Post Office is liable to
pay pursuant to paragraph 10.5.1.

11.6 In the case of Work Packages being carried out for a fixed price the number of hours for
applicable grades agreed for the Work Period in question under paragraph 10.4.7 shall
be recorded for the purposes of paragraphs 11.5.3 and 11.5.4 in lieu of the number of
hours actually spent in the Work Period.

11.7 For the purposes of this paragraph 11:

11.7.1 “Additional SI Charges” has the meaning attributed to it in paragraph 11.3;

11.7.2 “Notional FTE” in respect of any Financial Year (which shall represent the
notional size of the Core SI Team for that Financial Year) shall be determined as.

follows:

11.7.2.1 where the Financial Year in question commences prior 1 April 2005

the Notional FTE shall be 150; and

11.7.2.2 where the Financial Year in question commences on or after 1 April

2005 the Notional FTE shall be 90,

(irrespective of the actual number of members of the Core SI Team at the date
of calculation).

11.7.3 “Annual Pre-paid SI Capacity” in respect of any Financial Year shall be
calculated by multiplying the Notional FTE for that Financial Year by the

percentage shown in the following table for that Financial Year:

“Periodic Pre-paid SI Capacity” in respect of any Work Period shall be
calculated (in man days) by multiplying the Annual Pre-paid SI Capacity in
respect of the Financial Year in which such Work Period falls by 17, being the
average number of working days per Work Period, except that the multiplier for
the seventh Work Period in each of the Financial Years ending 31 March 2005
and 31 March 2010 shall be 21;

“Work Order Demand” in respect of any Work Period shall be calculated by
dividing the aggregate number of hours recorded in respect of that Work Period
under paragraphs 11.5.3, 11.5.4 and 11.5.5 by eight (representing the number
of hours in a working day) and by 17 (representing the average number of
working days in a Work Period) (except that the divisor for the seventh Work
Period in each of the Financial Years ending 31 March, 2005 and 31 March,
2010 shall be 21) and rounding up or down to the nearest integer;

“Quarter” means each of the four periods in each Financial Year comprising (i)
Work Periods 1, 2 and 3; (ii) Work Periods 4, 5 and 6; (iii) Work Periods 7, 8 and
9; and (iv) Work Periods 10,11 and 12;

“Actual Utilisation” in respect of any Work Period shall be calculated by dividing
the number of hours recorded by the Core SI Team under paragraph 11.5.3 by
eight (hours in the working day) and rounding up or down to the nearest integer;

“Actual Quarterly Utilisation” in respect of any Quarter shall be calculated by
aggregating the Actual Utilisations in respect of all the Work Periods in that
Quarter;

“Underwritten Utilisation” in respect of any Work Period shall be determined as
follows:

11.7.9.1 where the Financial Year in question commences prior 1 April 2005
, by multiplying the Periodic Pre-paid SI Capacity in respect of that
Work Period by the percentage set out in the following table
against the Work Order Demand applicable to that Work Period:

11.7.10 “Underwritten Quarterly Utilisation” in respect of any Quarter shall be calculated
by aggregating the Underwritten Utilisations in respect of all the Work Periods in
that Quarter;

11.7.11 “Quarterly Utilisation Value” in respect of any Quarter shall be calculated by
taking the aggregate number of hours recorded under paragraphs 11.5.3 and
11.5.4 by each grade of resource in respect of all the Work Periods in that
Quarter (the “Total Hours” for each grade), multiplying the amount of the Total
Hours for each such grade by the man rate applicable to that grade under
paragraph 6.2.1 of Schedule 10 and calculating the sum of the products in
respect of all such grades of resource;

11.7.12 “Quarterly Blended Man Rate” in respect of any Quarter shall be calculated by
dividing the Quarterly Utilisation Value in respect of such Quarter by the total
number of hours recorded in respect of all Work Periods in that Quarter under
paragraphs 11.5.3 and 11.5.4.

If the Actual Utilisation in respect of any Quarter shall be equal to or greater than the
Underwritten Utilisation for that Quarter, then no rebate shall be allowed to Post Office.

Subject to paragraphs 11.12 and 11.13, if the Actual Utilisation in respect of any Quarter
shall be less than the Underwritten Utilisation for that Quarter, Fujitsu Services shall
allow Post Office a rebate attributable to that Quarter, up to the value of those Additional
SI Charges for the Quarter. Such rebate shall be calculated by, multiplying (i) the
amount by which the Actual Quarterly Utilisation in respect of the Quarter fell short of
the Underwritten Quarterly Utilisation for the Quarter by (ii) the Quarterly Blended Man
Rate for the Quarter.

Any rebate attributable to any Quarter in accordance with paragraph 11.9 shall be
issued as a credit note set against future Additional SI Charges.

The Parties shall determine in which Financial Year each Release is designated to
occur, which shall be the Financial Year in which the majority of the work on the relevant
Release is to be carried out.

Allowance of any rebate under paragraph 11.9 in respect of any Quarter is subject to
the Financial Year of the Agreement in which the Quarter falls containing at least two
Releases each containing Work Packages which are substantial in nature.

If there are at least two Releases designated by the Parties as occurring in a Financial
Year each containing substantial Work Package content but the content of the largest
Release (in terms of billable hours) exceeds the aggregate of all the other Releases by
more than 30% then any rebate under paragraph 11.9 shall be calculated in relation to

each Quarter during that Financial Year on the basis that the percentages shown in
paragraph 11.7.3 are halved.

Fujitsu Services may agree (such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld) that a
rebate may be granted to Post Office under paragraph 11.9 notwithstanding paragraphs
11.12 and 11.13 if the underlying objective of workload smoothing is achieved by
different means.

The Parties may agree from time to time a mechanism whereby predictable unutilised
Core SI Team capacity is put to alternative use for the benefit of both Parties.

The Parties may agree to vary the allocations in paragraph 11.7.3 on a temporary or
permanent basis. Where the change is on a temporary basis, then unless otherwise
agreed, any such change in allocation will be carried forward and reversed in future
months such that the allocations will balance out over time. Such temporary change
(where the aggregate Core SI Team capacity for the Financial Year in question is not
affected) must be authorised by the Demand Planning Forum. Permanent change will
be a matter for the Change Control Procedure.

Where resources are shown in a Resource Plan as being provided by the Core SI Team
but Fujitsu Services substitutes Additional Resources for such Core SI Team resources
then to the extent that:

11.17.1 Post Office has not agreed (in accordance with this paragraph) that the
substitution can be made; and

11.17.2 the substitution is for reasons unconnected with any failure on the part of the
Post Office to perform its obligations or responsibilities; and

11.17.3 the result of the substitution is (or would but for this provision be) to increase the
net Charges payable by Post Office,

Fujitsu Services shall not be entitled to charge for such increase.

For the purposes of sub-paragraph 11.17.1 the agreement of the Post Office may be
given:

(a) expressly by reference to this paragraph 11.17; or

(b) implicitly by agreement of a more current Resource Plan which effects the
substitution in question,

but no agreement shall be effective under (b) above unless the Resource Plan which
first effects such substitution expressly refers to the Additional Resources in question

having been substituted for Core SI Team resources.

41. GENERAL
441 Fujitsu Services shall ensure that the Applicable Services are supported by Business

Continuity Plans. Where requested by Post Office and agreed by Fujitsu Services (such
agreement not to be unreasonably withheld) Fujitsu Services shall ensure that new
services are supported by Business Continuity Plans.

Fujitsu Services shall provide Post Office with a copy of every Business Continuity Plan,
as and when created. Without prejudice to Fujitsu Services’ obligations in respect of the
Business Continuity Plans set out in this Schedule 21, the Business Continuity Plans
shall not be subject to Post Office approval.

Fujitsu Services shall ensure that the Business Continuity Plans for each Applicable
Service are compatible with the overall service continuity framework set out in the CCD
entitled “Business Continuity Framework” (CS/SIP/002).

The Business Continuity Plans shall be based on impact and risk assessments as
agreed by Fujitsu Services and Post Office. Such assessments shall be reviewed when
agreed by the Parties, such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld.

Ownership of all contingency actions shall be identified in the Business Continuity
Plans. Contingency actions to be undertaken by Post Office in the event a Business
Continuity Plan is activated, shall be agreed by the Parties before inclusion in that plan.

The Business Continuity Plans shall include activation procedures and time periods
within which the contingency measures shall be activated.

The testing strategy for Business Continuity Plans shall be in two distinct parts:

1.7.1 initial testing before commencing the implementation of new services introduced
under the Change Control Procedure; and

1.7.2 regular testing of relevant Service components.

The Business Continuity Plans shall include without limitation the following:
1.8.1. prevention measures;

1.8.2 preparedness measures;

1.8.3 contingency measures;

1.8.4 recovery of normal service;

1.8.5 contact lists.

The Business Continuity Plans, the scheduling of regular tests and the review of such
tests shall be subject to joint periodic review (at least 4 times per year) by the continuity
managers of both Parties, the findings of such reviews to be reported to the Service
Management Forum at the next available meeting of that Forum.

When a contingency or continuity operation is invoked as a result of a fault in the
Applicable Services provided by Fujitsu Services, then the provisions of Schedule 15
shall continue to apply.

Fujitsu Services shall co-operate with Post Office and provide such assistance as is
reasonably requested by Post Office for the purposes of business continuity and fail-
over testing of End to End Services (excluding the elements of End to End Services
provided by Fujitsu Services). In the event that such co-operation and assistance is
requested by Post Office, Post Office and Fujitsu Services shall agree the method of
working and the periods for, timing and frequency of such testing so as to minimise
disruption and risks to the operation of other Services. Fujitsu Services’ charges in
respect of such co-operation and assistance (which shall be paid by Post Office to
Fujitsu Services) shall be calculated on a time and materials basis using Fujitsu
Services' rates as set out in paragraph 6.2 of Schedule 10.

The Central Network

The Central Network shall be configured such that there shall be no single point of
failure within the Central Network.

PLAN UPDATES

Fujitsu Services shall update the CCD entitled "Business Continuity Framework"
(CS/SIP/002) to include any:

2.1.1 references to new Business Continuity Plans and/or tests necessary to reflect:
2.1.1.1 the introduction of NBS, Debit Card;

2.1.1.2 any new services introduced under the Change Control Procedure;
and

2.1.1.3. changes to Applicable Services brought about as a result of the
introduction of new services,

and shall submit that updated CCD to Post Office (for agreement) by the
applicable date specified in the relevant project plan (if any) or otherwise agreed
between the Parties; and

2.1.2 changes to references to Business Continuity Plans and descriptions of tests (to
the level of detail required in the Business Continuity Framework (CS/SIP/002))

submitted to Post Office in accordance with paragraph 2.1 are subject to agreement by
Post Office, such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld.

TESTING

Unless agreed otherwise in accordance with paragraph 3.3 below, the Business
Continuity Services shall in respect of any new service introduced after the Amendment
Date through the Change Control Procedure:

3.1.1 include the performance of substantially the same business continuity tests as
are described in the CCD entitled “Business Continuity Framework"
(CS/SIP/002) prior to the introduction of that new service; and

3.1.2 include any specific business continuity tests agreed by the Parties.

The tests referred to in paragraph 3.1 above shall be conducted with the business
continuity tests conducted for the infrastructure supporting the Applicable Services and
scheduled in accordance with working practice for the Applicable Services. The
frequency of and method used for all business continuity tests shall be documented in
the document entitled "Business Continuity Test Plan" (CS/PLA/011).

Business continuity tests to be carried out under the Business Continuity Framework
may be cancelled or rescheduled and/or the method used for a test may be varied for
operational business reasons by agreement in writing between Post Office and Fujitsu
Services (such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld).

NBS SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS

Each Data Centre (if required to support the NBS on its own as a result of a failure of
the other Data Centre) shall have the capability in normal operation with no failures
having occurred:

4.1.1. to support the Contracted Volumes in relation to the NBS and Debit Card as
defined in the CCD entitled "Horizon Capacity Management and Business
Volumes” (PA/PER/033); and

4.1.2 to support Fujitsu Services’ obligations in respect of NBS Service Levels set out
in Annex 3 to Schedule 15 without preventing or impairing that Data Centre's
support for Fujitsu Services’ obligations in respect of the Service Levels for
other Services in existence at the Amendment Date.

The Data Centres (including NBS elements) will be configured such that no single point
of failure within the Data Centres will cause the NBS to fail with both Data Centres in
operation.

SCHEDULE 22
CONTRACT TERMINATION AND SERVICE TRANSFER
INTRODUCTION

This Schedule 22 covers the responsibilities and payments related to termination of this
Agreement.

For the purpose of this Schedule 22, termination of this Agreement includes:
1.2.1 termination of this Agreement before its expiry due to Fujitsu Services Default;

1.2.2 termination of this Agreement before its expiry without Fujitsu Services Default
(other than termination for Post Office Default under Clause 34.3, in which
event the Exit Plan will not be developed or implemented following such
termination unless the Parties agree otherwise);

1.2.3 termination of this Agreement at its expiry; and

1.2.4 if Post Office exercises its option to extend the term of this Agreement in
accordance with the provisions of Clause 33.2, the termination of this
Agreement at the expiry of such extended term.

In any of the above termination scenarios Post Office may seek to obtain the delivery of
services equivalent to the Services under this Agreement or seek to continue the
Services after termination in each case either by performing them itself or by means of
the Next Supplier.

The Parties acknowledge that it is their overall objective to procure, so far as is
reasonable and practicable, that there shall be an orderly transfer of responsibilities for
the delivery of the Services provided under this Agreement or an orderly and efficient
transition from the provision of the Services to the provision of equivalent services (as
the case may be) to the Next Supplier and that any risk to or adverse effect on the
continuity and quality of the Services during such transfer shall be minimised.

The purpose of this Schedule 22 is to:
1.5.1 set out the main steps to be followed on termination of this Agreement;

1.5.2 set out the assistance that Fujitsu Services shall provide to Post Office and/or
its Next Supplier with the intention of helping them (if it is Post Office’s chosen
strategy to do so) put themselves in a position to commence performance of the
Services or equivalent services promptly upon expiry of this Agreement or as
soon as reasonably practicable after completion of any period of notice of
termination given by Post Office to Fujitsu Services; and

1.5.3 set out the Parties’ obligations with respect to the development and
maintenance of the Exit Strategy and the Exit Plan.

2. ASSET REGISTER, EXIT STRATEGY AND EXIT PLAN

21 The Exit Strategy and the Exit Plan shall be developed and maintained in two phases
(each a “Phase”) as follows:

2.2 Phase One

2.2.4

Between the Amendment Date and 31 March 2003:

2.2.1.1

2.2.1.2

2.2.1.3

Fujitsu Services shall complete the list of assets in each of the
categories of assets identified in the CCD entitled “Transfer Asset
Register” (BP/SPE/041) (the “Asset Register”) at the level of detail and
giving such information in each case as envisaged by version 1.0 of
that CCD;

Fujitsu Services shall establish the Exit Strategy which shall be
documented in a CCD which shall include the matters set out in
paragraph 2.2.2; and

the Parties shall, in light of the Exit Strategy established in accordance
with paragraph 2.2.1.2, consider the Exit Plan in Annex 1 to this
Schedule and update it to identify at a high level any additional
activities which the Parties agree are required in relation to termination
of this Agreement, the detail of such activities to be included in the Exit
Plan in Phase Two.

The Exit Strategy shall:

2.2.2.1

2.2.2.2

2.2.2.3

2.2.2.4

set out a generic description of all probable post termination scenarios
relevant to this Agreement (each an “Exit Scenario”) including, without
limitation, the following:

(a) full or partial continuation of services substantially the same as
the Services by the Next Supplier;

(b) full or partial provision of equivalent services by the Next
Supplier fully or partially utilising the Horizon Service

Infrastructure; and

(c) full or partial provision of equivalent services by a Next Supplier
utilising entirely new infrastructure.

identify the major factors which are common to all the Exit Scenarios
and those which occur in some only of the Exit Scenarios;

set out the roles and responsibilities of the Parties in the development
of the Exit Plan in Phase Two;

set out in broad and general terms:

Schedule 22 Version 5.0

distinguishing between those categories which will be required
in all probable Exit Scenarios and those which will be required
only in particular Exit Scenarios; and
(b) the sources of such information and how it will be provided.
2.2.3. Once in every twelve months or if the Commercial Forum decide it is necessary

to do so as a result of significant changes to the Services, the Parties shall
jointly review and update the Asset Register and/or the Exit Strategy. If the
Asset Register or the Exit Strategy is brought up to date following a change to
the Services, then that document need not be brought up to date for a further
twelve months unless the Commercial Forum decides otherwise.

23 Phase Two

2.3.1

than twenty four (24) months prior to expiry of this Agreement or within one
week after notice of early termination of this Agreement, Fujitsu Services shall
provide reasonable assistance to Post Office for the purposes of determining
the implications at that time of the Exit Scenarios and the possible exercise by
Post Office of its option to extend this Agreement in accordance with the
provisions of Clause 33.2.

Within three (3) months of making the request referred to in paragraph 2.3.1
above, or within four weeks after notice of early termination of this Agreement,
Post Office shall give Fujitsu Services its view as to which of the strategies in
the Exit Strategy should be followed by the Post Office on exit and/or whether
Post Office may exercise its option to extend this Agreement in accordance with
the provisions of Clause 33.2 (the “Proposed Exit Strategy”).

No later than two calendar months after receipt of the views of Post Office in
accordance with paragraph 2.3.2, Fujitsu Services shall produce an updated
Exit Plan for agreement with Post Office, such update to:

2.3.3.1 include all of the matters referred to in paragraph 2.3.5; and

2.3.3.2 be documented in a CCD which shall supersede and replace Annex 1
to this Schedule 22.

Fujitsu Services shall ensure that once the updated Exit Plan referred to in
paragraph 2.3.3 has been approved, it is kept up-to-date on a general basis and
following any significant changes to this Agreement.

The updated Exit Plan referred to in paragraph 2.3.3 shall, in the circumstances
of the Proposed Exit Strategy, cover the duties, roles and responsibilities of the
Parties, the practical steps needed to be taken by Fujitsu Services and Post
Office, time scales and milestones, in each case in relation to each of the
matters set out in Annex 1 to this Schedule 22 and to the extent not covered by

relation to the Services (including performance statistics and details of
any outstanding Incidents).

24 The Exit Strategy and the Exit Plan shall at all times during Phase One and Phase Two
be developed and revised by agreement between the Parties under the Soft Change
Control Procedure such that they are consistent with the principles set out in this

Schedule 22 Version 5.0

Schedule 22 (as it may be amended from time to time under the Hard Change Control
Procedure).

Each Party shall act and negotiate reasonably in agreeing the contents of the Exit
Strategy and the Exit Plan and shall not unreasonably require the exclusion of matters
which the other Party reasonably requests should be included or the inclusion of
matters which the other Party reasonably requests should be excluded.

Any failure to agree the Exit Strategy or a revision to the Exit Plan shall not prejudice the
rights and/or obligations of either Party pursuant to this Schedule.

Fujitsu Services and Post Office will discharge their respective responsibilities and
perform their obligations as set out in this Schedule and, when required by the Exit
Strategy or Exit Plan, in accordance with that document.

To the extent that there is an inconsistency between the terms of the Exit Strategy or
Exit Plan and this Schedule then, unless expressly stated otherwise, the terms of this
Schedule shall prevail.

NEXT SUPPLIERS

Subject to Post Office procuring that each prospective Next Supplier enters into an
Agreed Form NDA or any other form of non-disclosure agreement mutually agreed by
Post Office, Fujitsu Services and such prospective Next Supplier, Fujitsu Services will
provide Post Office with reasonable information and assistance in relation to Post
Office's tender process conducted for the provision of services to replace the Services
or the performance of the Services by a replacement contractor.

Post Office may at any time by notice to Fujitsu Services nominate the Person to be the
Next Supplier. Post Office shall procure that the Next Supplier shall enter into an
Agreed Form NDA or any other form of non-disclosure agreement mutually agreed by
Post Office, Fujitsu Services and such Next Supplier. Fujitsu Services shall not be liable
for any breach of this Agreement to the extent caused by the Next Supplier.

Where Post Office appoints or intends to appoint a Next Supplier, Post Office shall be
responsible for liaising with and ensuring the co-operation of such Next Supplier in all
planning and handover activities in respect of exit transition and where obligations in the
Exit Plan which fall to Post Office are due to be performed by or with the co-operation of
the Next Supplier, such obligation will be deemed to include an obligation on the Post
Office to procure such performance or co-operation from the Next Supplier.

OTHER EXIT ASSISTANCE

Fujitsu Services shall use all reasonable endeavours to procure an orderly and efficient
transition from the provision of the Services to the provision of identical or equivalent
services (as the case maybe) to the Next Supplier and shall co-operate with the Next
Supplier as required in order to fulfil the obligations under this Schedule 22.

Where Post Office wishes to carry out the Implementation of Branch Hardware or Stand-
Alone Hardware it will procure a Hardware Impact Assessment from Fujitsu Services.
All Hardware Impact Assessments will be carried out by the Parties jointly.

PLANNING

Where following Hardware Impact Assessment Post Office decides to proceed with the
applicable Implementation and procure the applicable Branch Hardware or Stand-Alone
Hardware Post Office shall work with Fujitsu Services to plan and manage certain
aspects of the Installation Management and/or Installation. Included (without limitation)
in such planning and management are planning for constraints, consideration and input
regarding the Installation and maintenance approaches to support the hardware product
selection decision and the rollout aspect of the Installation.

IMPLEMENTATION OF BRANCH HARDWARE AND STAND-ALONE HARDWARE

Where following Hardware Impact Assessment Post Office decides to proceed with the
applicable Implementation and procure the applicable Branch Hardware Post Office will
either:

5.1.1 procure the entire Implementation (other than elements specifically reserved to
Post Office) from Fujitsu Services; or

5.1.2 procure certain of those elements of the Implementation from Fujitsu Services
and either carry out the remaining elements itself or contract with third parties to
do so.

The table set out in the Annex to this Schedule sets out a non-exhaustive list of those
elements of the Implementation of Branch Hardware which may be carried out by Post
Office, Fujitsu Services and third parties.

21 Schedule Content

2.4.4

This Schedule 24 sets out the obligations and responsibilities of each Party in
respect of the Banking Implementation Activities.

Certain provisions in this Schedule 24 grant rights or impose obligations which
take effect or continue after the completion of the Banking Implementation
Activities. As soon as reasonably practicable after completion of the Banking
Implementation Activities, Fujitsu Services and Post Office shall use reasonable
endeavours to transfer (via the Hard Change Control procedure) such ongoing

have been completed;

(b) there shall be no outstanding NB High Severity NBS
Acceptance Progress Incidents; and

(c) the number of outstanding NB Medium Severity Acceptance
Progress Incidents shall be 5 or less.

If the Parties do not agree whether NBS Acceptance or NBS Stage Progression
should occur, the provisions of paragraphs 6.6 and 6.7 of this Schedule 24
relating to Dispute resolution shall apply.

A NBS Acceptance Incident or NBS Acceptance Progress Incident which
following investigation by Fujitsu Services is found to have been solely caused
by a fault or deficiency in End To End Banking other than those elements of End
to End Banking provided by Fujitsu Services shall not count towards the
thresholds in paragraphs 6.3.1 and 6.3.2 of this Schedule 24.

NBS Acceptance Incidents or NBS Acceptance Progress Incidents which result
from the same failure or deficiency shall be counted as a single NBS
Acceptance Incident or NBS Acceptance Progress Incident (as applicable) for
the purposes of the thresholds in paragraphs 6.3.1 and 6.3.2 of this Schedule
24.

If, other than as a result of a Default of Fujitsu Services, it is impossible for an
NBS Test to be carried out when scheduled in the NBS Testing Plan then that
NBS Test (a "Deferred NBS Test") shall instead be carried out by Fujitsu
Services as soon as reasonably practicable or at such later time as the Parties
may agree (which shall be no later than 6 months after NBS Acceptance)
provided that performance on that agreed date does not, other than as a result
of a Default of Fujitsu Services, become impossible (in which event the
Deferred NBS Test shall be carried out by Fujitsu Services as soon as
reasonably practicable).

The non-occurrence of a Deferred NBS Test at the time originally scheduled in
the NBS Testing Plan shall not prevent NBS Stage Progression or NBS
Acceptance, each of which shall be assessed on the basis of:

Deferred NBS Tests; and

those Deferred NBS Tests which, when rescheduled in accordance
with paragraph 6.3.6 of this Schedule 24 are due to take place for the
purposes of the next NBS Stage Progression or for NBS Acceptance,
as the case may be.

If when a Deferred NBS Test is carried out after NBS Acceptance it is not
successfully completed that failure shall not of itself constitute a Default under
this Agreement or entitle Post Office to raise an NBS Acceptance Incident or
NBS Stage Progression Incident.

The failure of Fujitsu Services to carry out a Deferred NBS Test in accordance
with paragraph 6.3.6 of this Schedule 24 shall constitute a Default under this
Agreement.

Paragraph 6.3.8 of this Schedule 24 shall not act to reduce or alter the liability
of Fujitsu Services for any breaches by it of this Agreement.

NBS Tests

6.4.1.1

6.4.1.2

6.4.1.3

Each of the NBS Acceptance Criteria will be verified by one or more
NBS Tests. A NBS Test may be either a NBS Trial or a NBS Review
(as described in paragraph 2 of Annex 1 to this Schedule 24).

NBS Reviews will only be used where more direct testing methods in
the form of a NBS Trial are not available or appropriate.

Evidence (including, without limitation, test results, test observations,
data or other information) provided by Fujitsu Services for review in
relation to NBS Tests ("NBS Testing Evidence") shall by default be
available to all Post Office employees and contractors unless such
evidence is:

(a) Confidential Information, in which case disclosure shall be
governed by the provisions of Clause 50 of this Agreement; or

(b) considered to be or categorised as sensitive in accordance with
paragraphs 6.4.1.4 or 6.4.1.5 of this Schedule 24, in which case
disclosure will be governed by those provisions (as applicable).

NBS Testing Evidence that can reasonably be considered to be
particularly sensitive because access to such information could
compromise the security of the NBS or other Post Office Services will
be restricted to named employees or contractors of Post Office who
shall be nominated by Post Office to review it on Post Office's behalf
and access to the information shall be in accordance with such
reasonable conditions as may be imposed by Fujitsu Services.

Subject to paragraph 6.4.1.6, NBS Testing Evidence which is
categorised by Fujitsu Services (acting reasonably) as particularly
commercially sensitive to Fujitsu Services shall only be disclosed to
named employees or contractors of Post Office (such named
individuals to be approved by Fujitsu Services). Post Office shall place
such named employees and contractors under a duty to keep
confidential and not disclose Fujitsu Services’ commercially sensitive
information to any other person or Party without Fujitsu Services’ prior
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed).

Fujitsu Services shall not be entitled to categorise any NBS Testing
Evidence as commercially sensitive where that evidence solely
reflects a visible manifestation or result of the operation of the NBS or
the NB System, as opposed to how the NBS or the NB System
achieves that manifestation or result.

Sensitive information disclosed as evidence pursuant to paragraphs
6.4.1.4 or 6.4.1.5 above may also be disclosed by Post Office or
Fujitsu Services to the NBS Expert, the NBS Acceptance Management
Board or the NBS Acceptance Board if such disclosure is necessary
for the resolution of a Dispute.

Fujitsu Services shall supply at Post Office's request such supporting
evidence for the completion of a NBS Test which can be reasonably
regarded as necessary for Post Office to validate whether the NBS
Acceptance Criteria for that test have been met.

Raising of NBS Acceptance Incidents and other occurrences

6.4.2.1

Subject to paragraph 6.4.2.6 below, a NBS Acceptance Incident shall
be raised by Fujitsu Services in each of the following circumstances:

(a) a NBS Trial fails to meet the NBS Acceptance Criteria for that
trial;

(b) a document subject to a NBS Review fails to meet the NBS
Acceptance Criteria for that document;

(c) an observation of a NBS Trial or of the NB Pilot (Soft Launch)
demonstrates that: (i) the NBS Acceptance Criteria are not
being met; (ii) the introduction of the NBS has resulted or might
reasonably be expected to result in the Applications (other than
the NBS) or the Infrastructure Services no longer functioning or
being performed (as the case may be) in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement or no longer having the capability
to be performed in accordance with the Service Levels relating
thereto; or (iii) the NBS will not have the capability to meet the
Service Levels set out in Part A of Annex 3 of Schedule 15 as
and when required by this Agreement.

In addition, Fujitsu Services shall report to Post Office any material
undesirable occurrences which are not NBS Acceptance Incidents
observed by it whilst conducting NBS Tests.

Subject to paragraph 6.4.2.6 below, Post Office may raise a NBS
Acceptance Incident whenever Post Office becomes aware of
evidence that any of the above circumstances has arisen or becomes
aware that the NBS Acceptance Criteria are not being met or that
introduction of the NBS has resulted or might reasonably be expected
to result in the Applications (other than the NBS) or the Infrastructure
Services no longer functioning or being performed (as the case may
be) in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.

Where this Agreement expressly states that the NBS will not:

(a) permit specified functions or activities; or

(b) cause certain specified behaviour,
and such functions, activities or behaviour are observed to occur during
testing of the NBS then, subject to paragraph 6.4.2.6 below, the
observing Party shall (in the case of Fujitsu Services) or may (in the
case of Post Office) raise a NBS Acceptance Incident.

If:

(a) a NBS Test is required in respect of a provision of this

Agreement of the type referred to in paragraph 6.4.2.3 of this

Schedule 24; or

(b) a NBS Acceptance Incident is raised in relation to such
provision,

that the functions, activities or behaviour referred to in paragraph
6.4.2.3 of this Schedule 24 do not occur. Fujitsu Services shall not be
required to demonstrate on an ongoing basis that such functions,
activities or behaviour do not occur or will not occur.

If following a successful NBS Test or proof of resolution of a NBS
Acceptance Incident as referred to in paragraph 6.4.2.4 of this
Schedule 24, a further NBS Acceptance Incident shall (in the case of
Fujitsu Services) or may (in the case of Post Office) be raised in
accordance with paragraph 6.4.2.3 of this Schedule 24 if the
applicable functions, activities or behaviour above are observed to
occur again.

Each Party shall raise a NBS Acceptance Incident as soon as
reasonably practicable after becoming aware of such incident.
However, NBS Acceptance Incidents shall not be raised in respect of
any NBS Acceptance Criteria before commencement of the NBS
Acceptance stage or phase designated in the NBS Testing Plan for
testing those NBS Acceptance Criteria. Once NBS Acceptance has
occurred no new NBS Acceptance Incidents may be raised. For the
purposes of this paragraph 6.4.2.6, a "new NBS Acceptance Incident"
means a NBS Acceptance Incident which occurs after the NBS
Acceptance Date or which occurs on or before that date, but is not
reported to Fujitsu Services before the NBS Acceptance Date. Once
NBS Stage Progression has occurred no additional NBS Acceptance
Incidents shall be classified as NBS Acceptance Progress Incidents in
respect of that NBS Stage Progression.

NBS Acceptance Incidents shall be raised by being reported in writing
or by email by Post Office or Fujitsu Services (as applicable) to the
other Party's NBS Acceptance Manager.

6.4.3 Analysis and classification of NBS Acceptance Incidents

6.4.3.1

Fujitsu Services shall analyse each NBS Acceptance Incident and
produce a written report (which shall be provided to Post Office NBS
Acceptance Manager) detailing Fujitsu Services’ proposals for:

(a) _ the severity classification of the NBS Acceptance Incident;

(b) related rectification activities (if applicable);

(c)  re-testing dates/periods (if applicable); and

Fujitsu Services shall not be obliged to repeat the detail set out above
in written reports relating to occurrences which are repeat instances of
an outstanding NBS Acceptance Incident, unless Fujitsu Services is or
becomes aware that any such repeat instance arises from a cause
which is different to that for other such instances where such detail
has already been provided. Reference shall be made in such written
reports to the original written report for the applicable outstanding NBS.
Acceptance Incident.

Each NBS Acceptance Incident shall be classified according to its
severity:

(a) for the purposes of NBS Acceptance; and

(b) if that NBS Acceptance Incident remains outstanding prior to
either NBS Stage Progression, for the purposes of the NBS
Stage Progression in question.

Fujitsu Services shall propose and Post Office and Fujitsu Services
shall agree (such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld) such
severity classifications for each NBS Acceptance Incident in
accordance with the criteria in the following table:

6.4.3.3 For the purpose of paragraph 6.4.3.2 a NBS Acceptance Incident shall
be regarded as having been caused by the introduction of the NBS:

(a) _ if that incident is identified in a NBS Trial, NBS Review or the
NB Pilot (Soft Launch); and

(b) where the behaviour of the Horizon Service Infrastructure giving
rise to that incident (i) has not been previously observed, or (ii)
had been previously observed in relation to the Application
(other than the NBS) or the Infrastructure Services but such
behaviour had been resolved prior to commencement of testing

of the NBS,

unless following investigation by Fujitsu Services, that incident is
found to be unrelated to the introduction of the NBS.

6.4.3.4 Where a NBS Acceptance Incident can be attributed to faults in the
NBS and faults in other elements of End to End Banking, the severity
of that incident (for the purposes of NBS Acceptance and NBS Stage
Progression) shall be classified with reference to the fault in the NBS
alone and not those faults in other elements of End to End Banking.

6.4.4 Repeat Testing

Any failed NBS Acceptance Test may, prior to the end of the NB Pilot (Soft
Launch) phase, be repeated by Fujitsu Services as many times as necessary in
order for NBS Acceptance and/or NBS Stage Progression to be achieved.
Fujitsu Services shall propose dates for such repeat tests having regard to the
overall NB Project Plan. Post Office shall be responsible for making personnel
available to observe such repeat testing. In the case of repeated NBS Reviews,
Post Office shall be entitled to the same elapsed time for the repeated review as
was scheduled for the original failed review. Fujitsu Services shall only propose
repeat tests when it reasonably believes a different (i.e. improved) outcome

would result.

7. POST OFFICE NBS RESPONSIBILITIES AND NBS OBLIGATIONS

7.1 Introduction

7AA

7.1.2

Part 1 of this paragraph 7 sets out the responsibilities of Post Office in
connection with the implementation and acceptance of the NBS ("Banking
Implementation Responsibilities").

Part 2 of this paragraph 7 sets out the obligations of Post Office in connection
with the provision of the implementation and acceptance of the NBS ("Banking
Implementation Obligations").

Any failure by Post Office to carry out a Banking Implementation Responsibility
shall not be a Default under this Agreement.

The omission from the tables in this paragraph 7 of an obligation or
responsibility of Post Office connected with the implementation and acceptance
of the NBS shall:

7.1.4.1 _ if the obligation is stated as something for which Post Office "shall be
responsible", result in that obligation being classed as a “Banking
Implementation Responsibility" for the purpose of this Schedule 24;

7.1.4.2 _ if the obligation is stated to be something which Post Office "shall do",
result in that obligation being classed as a "Banking Implementation
Obligation" for the purpose of this Schedule 24;

7.1.4.3 _ if the obligation is to make payment to Fujitsu Services, result in that
obligation being classed as a "Banking Implementation Obligation" for
the purpose of this Schedule 24; and

7.1.4.4 in all other cases shall be, as the context so requires, a Banking
Implementation Obligation or Banking Implementation Responsibility
for the purposes of this Schedule 24.

Fujitsu Services shall not be liable to Post Office in respect of any breach of its
Obligations in respect of the implementation and acceptance of the NBS (the
“Dependent Obligations") or any delay in performing the Dependent Obligations
to the extent that such breach or delay was caused by the failure by Post Office
to carry out a Banking Implementation Obligation or a Banking Implementation
Responsibility (a "Dependency Failure").

Fujitsu Services shall notify Post Office in writing as soon as reasonably
practicable after Fujitsu Services becomes aware of any Dependency Failure or
becomes aware of any matters or circumstances which would with the effluxion
of time result in a Dependency Failure.

In the event of a Dependency Failure (other than in relation to any Level 1,
Level 2 or Level 3 NB T&M Work task under the NB Project Plan), Fujitsu
Services shall be entitled to recover from Post Office such reasonably incurred,
increased costs and expenses (if any) which it incurs in performing the
Dependent Obligation in question to the extent that such increased costs and
expenses were the result of the Dependency Failure. Fujitsu Services shall
provide a statement of such increased costs and expenses incurred for
approval by Post Office, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld.

Fujitsu Services shall use all reasonable endeavours to mitigate the amounts (if
any) payable under paragraph 7.1.7 of this Schedule 24.

7.2 The references to “N01” and “NOS” in the column headed “Reference” in the tables
below are references to Schedules NO1 and NOS to this Agreement in its form prior to

that set out in Annexes 3 and 4 to this Schedule, respectively.

Annexes 3 and 4 to this Schedule comprise the Level 1 and Level 2 elements of
the NB Project Plan as at the date of approval of CCN850.

The Level 3 elements of the NB Project Plan shall be at a level of detail
equivalent to that set out in the example at Annex 5 of this Schedule (which is
included for information purposes only).

In respect of each version of the NB Project Plan provided in accordance with
paragraph 8.2.6 of this Schedule, each Level 3 task on the NB Project Plan:

8.2.5.1 having a deliverable to be produced as a result of that task shall have
a summary description of that deliverable; and

8.2.5.2 if T&M Work, shall have a T&M Budget associated with it.

Twice in every Work Period following the date of approval of CCN850, Fujitsu
Services shall issue a revised version of the NB Project Plan which shall
contain:

8.2.6.1 the Level 2 elements of the NB Project Plan for the 8 months following
the start of the week in which that revised NB Project Plan is issued
(or until the date shown in the table in paragraph 8.9.1.3 of this
Schedule 24 for cessation of NB project planning, if shorter); and

8.2.6.2 the Level 3 elements of the NB Project Plan for the 4 months following
the start of the week in which that revised NB Project Plan is issued
(or until the date shown in the table in paragraph 8.9.1.3 of this

8.4 Budget

Fujitsu Services shall report to Post Office in accordance with paragraph 8.3.1
of this Schedule not later than the eighth Working Day after the end of the
period to which the report relates.

Fujitsu Services shall provide together with the reports to be provided under
paragraph 8.3.1 of this Schedule 24 a document setting out for the period to
which the report relates:

8.3.3.1 for each of Fujitsu Services’ personnel who worked on any NB T&M
Work task during that period, the proportion of that person's working
time spent on NB T&M Work tasks and the proportion spent on non-
NB T&M Work tasks;

8.3.3.2 time recording information showing for each NB T&M Work task on
which work was carried out during that period the amount of time for
which each individual who worked on that task did so; and

8.3.3.3 for each non-NB T&M Work task on which work was scheduled to be
carried out during that period the percentage of that task completed
during that period and the percentage of that task which was
scheduled to be completed during that period.

If at any time a Level 2 task has not been started or completed by the date set
for that event in the NB Project Plan Fujitsu Services shall notify Post Office
forthwith. If the failure to carry out that task:

8.3.4.1 affects any Level 2 task NB T&M Budget or external touchpoint (as set
out in or derived from the NB Project Plan), Fujitsu Services shall as
soon as reasonable practicable provide proposals to mitigate the
failure; or

8.3.4.2 affects neither any Level 2 task NB T&M Budget nor external
touchpoint (as set out in or derived from the NB Project Plan), Fujitsu
Services shall take appropriate mitigating action and shall report such
action to Post Office in accordance with paragraph 8.3.1 of this
Schedule.

Fujitsu Services shall notify Post Office as soon as reasonably practicable after
receipt of such if at any time Fujitsu Services receives any notice or information
from any of its subcontractors or suppliers which states or should reasonably
lead Fujitsu Services to believe that any non-NB T&M Work task will not be
completed by the date scheduled for its completion in the NB Project Plan.

Fujitsu Services may allocate and subsequently re-allocate the NB T&M Budget
for each Level 2 NB T&M Work task in the NB Project Plan between the Level 3
NB T&M Work tasks forming part of that Level 2 NB T&M Work task provided
that in the case of re-allocation the variance is no more than 25% of the total
original budgeted hours for the task whose budgeted hours are to be increased.

Any re-allocations of or increase to the T&M Budget other than in accordance
with paragraph 8.4.1 or 8.6.7 shall be agreed in writing by the Parties and in the
absence of agreement shall be determined by Post Office (acting reasonably)
and notified to Fujitsu Services in writing.

If a Level 2 or Level 3 NB T&M Work task has not been or cannot be completed
within the original, increased or reallocated NB T&M Budget for that task, and
the NB T&M Budget is not increased by Post Office (at the request of Fujitsu
Services), Fujitsu Services shall fulfil its obligations so far as it can do so within
that original, increased or reallocated NB T&M Budget and upon that budget
being exhausted, POL shall be deemed to have exercised its option under
paragraph 8.8 of this Schedule 24 in respect of that task and Fujitsu Services
shall be deemed to have received a Task Cancellation Notice (as defined in that
paragraph) in respect of that task.

Paragraph 8.4.3 of this Schedule 24, shall only apply to the extent that Fujitsu
Services is not in Default of its obligations in respect of the Level 2 or Level 3
task in question.

8.5 Fujitsu Services personnel

8.5.1

From the date of approval of CCN850 until the completion of all NB T&M Work,
Fujitsu Services shall supply the name, job title, project role and professional
service grade (as identified in Annex D to Schedule 10) for each of its personnel
working on the fulfilment of its obligations under this Agreement in relation to NB
T&M Work. Fujitsu Services shall supply a typical level of qualification and
experience for each grade type.

From the date of approval of CCN850 until the completion of all T&M Work,
Fujitsu Services shall produce organisational charts showing Fujitsu Services’
personnel working on the fulfilment of Fujitsu Services’ obligations under this
Agreement in relation to NB T&M Work. Fujitsu Services shall provide revised
versions of those charts to Post Office when there are material changes to
them.

Manager (or nominated deputy) and Post Office NBS Project Manager (or
nominated deputy) (such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld by either
of them) and shall take effect immediately subject to written confirmation (at
“Authority Level 2") between Post Office's Release 1 Programme Manager and
Fujitsu Services’ Programmes Director (or their nominated deputies). If the
Parties fail to reach such agreement at Authority Level 1, the dispute shall be
referred to Authority Level 2. If the Parties fail to reach such agreement at
Authority Level 2, the dispute shall be subject to the dispute resolution process
referred to in paragraph 8.6.10 of this Schedule 24. If the Parties reach such
agreement at Authority Level 1, but the Parties fail to reach agreement at
Authority Level 2, the Parties shall, unless agreed or determined otherwise,
work to the NB Project Plan as agreed at Authority Level 1. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in Clauses 58 or 46, written agreements and
confirmations referred to in paragraphs 8.6.1 to 8.6.11 of this Schedule 24 may
be effected by, without limitation, email exchange or agreed meeting minutes.

A refusal by Post Office to agree a change to the NB Project Plan pursuant to
paragraph 8.6.1 of this Schedule 24 shall be deemed to be reasonable if, in
Post Office's assessment, the change would be detrimental to the network
banking project as a whole even if the change would not be detrimental to the
implementation of the NBS.

Fujitsu Services shall be entitled at its discretion to reschedule the Level 3
elements of the NB Project Plan within the period bounded by the start and
completion dates for the associated Level 2 task in the NB Project Plan.

Whether or not delay has occurred to the NB Project Plan shall be on a neutral
basis of proof.

The provisions of this paragraph 8.6.5 shall apply if and to the extent that a
failure to carry out a Level 2 task by the completion date for that task in the NB
Project Plan is not due to a Default of Fujitsu Services including (without
limitation) where the delay is caused by:

8.6.5.1 a failure by Post Office to fulfil its obligations or responsibilities set out
or referred to in Schedule 24 (other than paragraph 5);

8.6.5.2 unfulfilled dependencies of Fujitsu Services on third Parties which are
specifically shown in the NB Project Plan; or

8.6.5.3 failures to agree agreements to agree.
If a Level 2 task is not completed or is forecast not to be completed by the date

specified in the NB Project Plan, the period for completing that delayed task
shall be extended by the minimum period reasonably necessary for the task to

Schedule 24 Version 5.0

be completed, taking into account, amongst any other factors which are
relevant:

8.6.6.1 to the extent they can be identified, the reasons for the delay, and
whether they would continue to cause delay;

8.6.6.2 Post Office's objectives in relation to End to End Banking;

8.6.6.3 the availability of appropriate resources (both existing Fujitsu Services
resources and any available to buy in);

8.6.6.4 the size of the NB T&M Budget originally allocated to the task
(applicable if the delayed task is a NB T&M Work task);

8.6.6.5 the nature of the task to be completed; and
8.6.6.6 other tasks which remain incomplete.

Fujitsu Services shall be entitled to increase the T&M Budget completing each
delayed Level 2 NB T&M task to reflect:

8.6.7.1 any additional work required; and/or

8.6.7.2 additional resource required to be allocated to that task, for it to be
completed within the period of extension described in paragraph 8.6.6
of this Schedule 24.

Unless the reason for a Level 2 task not being completed by the date specified
in the NB Project Plan is a Planning Discrepancy, the NB Rate Reduction Date
Rate shall be put back by the minimum period necessary to accommodate that
task (as extended in accordance with paragraph 8.6.6 of this Schedule 24) in
the NB Project Plan (which period shall be nil if the extended task did not impact
the critical path leading to NB Event 1). For the purposes of this paragraph 8.6.8
a "Planning Discrepancy" means any discrepancy or failure in the NB Project
Plan not arising from a Default by Fujitsu Services including but not limited to:

8.6.8.1 a structural oversight in the NB Project Plan such as a missed link in
any critical path in relation to an unknown dependency; and

8.6.8.2 mis-scoped tasks.
For the avoidance of doubt, paragraph 8.7 of this Schedule 24 shall apply if any

discrepancy or failure in the NB Project Plan arises from a Default of Fujitsu
Services.

Level 1 (such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld by either Party) and
shall take effect immediately subject to written confirmation at Authority Level 2.
If the Parties fail to reach such agreement at Authority Level 1 or Authority Level
2, for the purposes of establishing the effective ongoing NB Project Plan, Post
Office shall be entitled to determine:

8.6.9.1 on the basis and taking into account the factors set out in paragraph
8.6.6 of this Schedule 24, the amount by which time for a Level 2 task
shall be extended; and

Fujitsu Services shall work to that revised NB Project Plan but shall be entitled
to seek a further extension of time for such Level 2 T&M tasks and/or increase

8.6.11.2 neither failure results from a Default of Fujitsu Services,

the NB Rate Reduction Date shall be put back by the minimum period
necessary to accommodate both Level 2 tasks in the NB Project Plan (which
period shall be nil if the tasks do not impact the critical path leading to NB Event
1).

Subject to paragraphs 8.6.13 and 8.6.14 of this Schedule 24, the obligations of
Fujitsu Services in respect of completion of all dates in the NB Project Plan
(whether or not NB T&M Work) shall be to use reasonable endeavours to
achieve them.

Fujitsu Services shall achieve completion of NBS Deployment by the date (the
“NBS Release Complete Date") specified for NBS Release Complete in the NB
Project Plan (as may be adjusted in accordance with the provisions of this
Schedule 24). Save as specified in paragraph 8.6.14 of this Schedule 24, failure
by Fujitsu Services to achieve completion of NBS Deployment by the NBS
Release Complete Date shall not of itself constitute a Default and time shall not
be of the essence in respect of Fujitsu Services’ obligation to achieve
completion of NBS Deployment by the NBS Release Complete Date.

If Fujitsu Services has not completed NBS Deployment by the NBS Release
Complete Date Post Office may serve notice on Fujitsu Services which specifies
a reasonable time period (after the NBS Release Complete Date) for NBS
Deployment to be completed. Time shall be of the essence in relation to the
reasonable time period specified in the notice for completion of NBS
Deployment and failure to achieve NBS Deployment by expiry of that
reasonable time period shall constitute a Default of Fujitsu Services entitling
Post Office to terminate this Agreement.

8.7 Fujitsu Services default

8.7.4

If and to the extent that a failure to carry out a Level 2 task by the completion
date for that task in the NB Project Plan has been caused by a Default of Fujitsu
Services:

8.7.1.1 Fujitsu Services shall use reasonable endeavours to complete that
task as soon as practicable;

8.7.1.2 _ if the failure to carry out that task affects the NB T&M Budget for that
task or an external touchpoint (as set out in or derived from the NB
Project Plan), Fujitsu Services shall in addition to any other proposals
for mitigation made under paragraph 8.3.4.1 of this Schedule 24:

Schedule 24 Version 5.0

(a) use all reasonable endeavours to keep the same individual or
group of individuals as have been allocated to that task, working
on that task until its completion; and

(b) optimise the allocation of resources between tasks;
so that potential overall delay to the NB Project Plan is minimised; and

8.7.1.3 Post Office shall be entitled to recover from Fujitsu Services, Post
Office's additional internal costs and sub-contractor costs reasonably
incurred as a direct result of that Default. Post Office shall provide a
statement of such costs incurred for approval by Fujitsu Services,
such approval not to be unreasonably withheld;

8.7.1.4 the NB Rate Reduction Date shall not be put back to reflect delay to
the NB Project Plan caused by that Default.

8.8 Task cancellation

8.8.1

8.8.2

Post Office may at any time before NBS Acceptance send a notice (a "Task
Cancellation Notice") cancelling any Level 2 NB T&M Work task (the "Cancelled
Task").

Upon receipt of a Task Cancellation Notice Fujitsu Services shall:
8.8.2.1 not be obliged to complete the Cancelled Task;

8.8.2.2 not (except as set out in paragraph 8.8.3 of this Schedule 24) carry
out any further work on or expend any further monies in relation to the
Cancelled Task; and

8.8.2.3 be released from its obligations in this Agreement to which that
Cancelled Task relates and obligations in respect of any other NB
T&M Work the performance of which is dependent upon the
completion of that Cancelled Task.

In the 5 working days following the receipt of a Task Cancellation Notice Fujitsu
Services shall, so far as reasonably possible and using no more resource than
that allocated to the Cancelled Task, close down and document the position
reached in respect of the Cancelled Task. All such work shall be NB T&M Work
for which Fujitsu Services shall provide Post Office with a NB T&M Budget.
Such NB T&M Budget shall include any third Party costs which were part of the
T&M budget for the Cancelled Task which Fujitsu Services is unable to mitigate
(such costs to be agreed at Authority Level 1) (such agreement not to be
unreasonably withheld by either Party)).

8.9 Dates

8.9.1

If the aggregate value (by T&M budget) of all Cancelled Tasks becomes more
than £6,500,000 Post Office shall be deemed, as at the date of receipt by
Fujitsu Services of the Task Cancellation Notice for the Cancelled Task which
causes that sum to be exceeded, to have exercised its right to terminate the
NBS for convenience under paragraph 9.1 of this Schedule.

Following the cancellation of a task:
8.8.5.1 The Parties shall amend:

(a) _ the NB Project Plan in accordance with paragraph 8.6.1 of this
Schedule 24; and

(b) the NBS Acceptance Criteria, the provisions of this Agreement
and any CCDs as necessary under the Change Control
Procedure,

to reflect that the task will not be carried out and the release of Fujitsu
Services’ obligations as referred to in paragraph 8.8.2.3 of this
Schedule 24.

8.8.5.2 Where reasonably practicable, one CCN may be used to introduce the
amendments required under sub-paragraph 8.8.5.1 for more than one
such release. If the Parties' agreement to such amendments is
required for the purposes of the NBS Acceptance Procedure, such
amendments may be agreed in writing at Authority Level 1, and shall
be subsequently ratified using the Change Control Procedure.

8.8.5.3 The amendments referred to in paragraph 8.8.5.2 shall be such as to
ensure that (subject to paragraph 8.8.4) the effect of cancellation is
not to render NBS Acceptance impossible.

If Post Office wishes Fujitsu Services to resume work on any Cancelled Task,
the Parties shall enter into good faith negotiations in relation to the terms of that
restart.

The tables in paragraphs 8.9.1.1, 8.9.1.2 and 8.9.1.3 of this Schedule 24 set out
the dates contained in the initial version of the NB Project Plan (as at the date of
approval of CCN850) for the milestones and touchpoints between Fujitsu
Services and Post Office or third Parties for the delivery of the NBS. The Parties
agree that the dates in those tables need not be updated to reflect changes
made subsequently to the NB Project Plan and that the NB Project Plan shall
have precedence over those tables.

Post Office's rights under this Agreement in respect of Defaults of Fujitsu Services
which are not exclusively NBS Defaults.

In the event of notice being given under paragraph 9.1, Post Office shall on termination
of the Banking Implementation Activities pay to Fujitsu Services the NBS Termination
Charge (calculated in accordance with paragraph 10.2).

terminate.

In the event of termination of the Banking Implementation Activities before NBS
Acceptance, Post Office shall, without prejudice to Post Office's other rights and
remedies but subject to payment of all sums due and payable to Fujitsu Services up to
the date of Banking Implementation Activities termination, have the option, exercisable
at any time within one month after notice of termination, to acquire from Fujitsu Services
or to require Fujitsu Services to permit a replacement contractor to acquire from it, in
consideration of the NBS Transfer Payment, those NBS Project Assets which can be
separated without impact upon performance of the Services (other than the Banking
Implementation Activities).

In the event that Post Office exercises the option referred to in paragraph 9.6, Post
Office shall pay to Fujitsu Services the NBS Transfer Payment (calculated in
accordance with paragraph 10.4).

All the assets to be acquired pursuant to the exercise by Post Office of its option under
paragraph 9.7 shall be acquired “as is", but free from encumbrances and the Parties
agree that all express and implied warranties and conditions relating to such assets are
excluded to the full extent permitted by law.

any sums which Post Office is entitled to retain in accordance with
paragraph 2.2 of Part A of Annex D to Schedule 10, for NB T&M Work
carried out up to and including the date of termination less an amount
equal to the aggregate of all payments received by Fujitsu Services in
respect of such NB T&M Work;

10.2.2.4 Y shall be the sum of £4,000,000.00 (four million pounds).

10.3 NBS Transfer Services

10.3.1 Transfer of data

10.3.1.1

On notice of termination of the Banking Implementation Activities
Fujitsu Services shall, within one month, deliver to Post Office:

(a) an inventory of the Post Office Data arising from the operation
of or related to the NBS, plus any other NBS related data
available for transfer or deletion;

(b) a data structure definition covering all such data available for
transfer or deletion;

(c) a proposed physical transfer method and method of deletion;

Banking Implementation Activities or three months after agreement of
the data transfer and deletion plan, whichever is later, Fujitsu Services
and Post Office shall co-operate in commencing testing and proving
the data transfer and deletion plan, such that transfer may be
concluded in accordance with the agreed plan. Once the transfer of
Post Office Data to Post Office in accordance with this paragraph is
complete, all remaining Post Office Data to which this paragraph
10.3.1 applies held by Fujitsu Services shall be destroyed. For the
purpose of this paragraph "destroyed" means physical destruction of
the media upon which such data are held or irretrievable deletion of
data from such media (including, without limitation, by reformatting
those media).

This paragraph 10.3.1 shall apply only in respect of Post Office Data
or other data held by Fujitsu Services and to the extent applicable to
the NBS (including, without limitation, records of Banking transactions
relating to any period of the NB Pilot (Soft Launch) which may have
been carried out).

Office under the terms of paragraph 9.7.

Within three months of receiving Fujitsu Services' asset register as
described in paragraph 10.3.2.1 above, Post Office shall notify Fujitsu
Services of the assets it wishes to be transferred, and Post Office and
Fujitsu Services shall enter good faith discussions to develop a plan
for asset transfer, covering both passing of title to assets and any

then should Post Office wish to exercise its option under paragraph
9.7, the NBS Transfer Payment shall be £1; and

10.4.1.2 in all other cases, should Post Office wish to exercise its option under
paragraph 9.7 to acquire NBS Project Assets, the NBS Transfer
Payment shall be a sum equivalent to the total charges to Post Office
as set out in Annex D of Schedule 10 (or relevant portion thereof) for
the NBS Project Assets to be transferred less:

(a) an amount equal to the aggregate of all payments received by
Fujitsu Services prior to the date of termination for those NBS
Project Assets; and

Assets (as set out in Annex D to Schedule 10 or the relevant
portion thereof) as Fujitsu Services is reasonably able to avoid
or mitigate as a result of the early termination,

save that where the resulting figure is less than £1 then the NBS Transfer
Payment shall be £1.

LINK, Banks and Post Office and/or Royal Mail Group systems but excluding the NBS
and the NB System). This testing stage shall be under Post Office's control.

Acceptance Stage 3 (the "Partial E2E Testing Stage") - this stage involves the testing
and early release of the NBS in a parallel end-to-end mode, including NBE, LINK,
Banks and Post Office and/or Royal Mail Group systems. This stage will be undertaken
partially in parallel with NBS testing cycles 4 and 5 within the NBS Testing Stage. This
testing stage shall be under Post Office's control and Post Office shall ensure that it and
other third Parties with whom these tests are to be carried out are ready and available
to participate in such parallel end-to-end testing.

Acceptance Stage 4 (the “NB Full E2E Testing Stage") - this stage involves testing of the
NBS as part of testing of full End to End Banking (including NBS, NBE, LINK, Post
Office and/or Royal Mail Group Systems and Banks ready and available for participation
in testing of full End to End Banking). Post Office shall ensure that the other Parties with
whom these tests are to be carried out are ready and available to participate in such full
end-to-end testing. This testing stage shall be under Post Office's control.

Acceptance Stage 5 ("NBS/NBE Testing Stage") - this stage shall be undertaken within
the NB Pilot (Soft Launch) phase and involves the testing of whether the NBS and NBE
work in an operational environment and are ready for full operational rollout. This testing
stage shall be under Post Office's control.

Acceptance Stage 6 ("CAPO Testing Stage") - this stage involves end-to-end testing
with the CAPO. This stage shall be under Post Office's control.

Acceptance Stage 7 ("Bank Interface Testing Stage") - this stage involves testing of
interfaces to Banks. This Acceptance Stage 7 will be repeated as each new Bank is
introduced. This stage shall be under Post Office's control. If Acceptance Stage 7 or any
element of Acceptance Stage 7 takes place following NBS Acceptance, Fujitsu Services’
involvement in any such stage will be agreed under the Change Control Procedure.

The NB Pilot (Soft Launch) phase involves testing the NBS and NB System as part of
the End to End Banking service in a live environment. This NB Pilot (Soft Launch)
phase shall be under Post Office control.
