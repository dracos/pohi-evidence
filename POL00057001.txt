Statement of: David DIXON

Age if under 18: Over 18 (if over 18 insert ‘over 18’)

This statement (consisting of 2 pages each signed by me) is true to the best of my knowledge and belief and I
make it knowing that, if it is tendered in evidence, I shall be liable to prosecution if I have wilfully stated in it
anything which I know to be false or do not believe true.

Dated the 22 day of September 2011

lam currently employed by Post Office Ltd and have been so for approximately sixteen years. I work within the

Retail Cash Management Team based in Leeds.

My general duties involve monitoring the cash being sent to and from Post Office branches including the amount
they are holding against their business needs. A Post Office branch is referred to as cash surplus if they would
receive more cash into them, through cash deposits, than they would pay out. This would create excess cash
within the branch and would mean that the branch would need to return cash to our cash centres, as opposed to

requiring cash deliveries to meet payment needs.

The Post Office uses a computer system known as SapADS, which is an advanced distribution system. This.
system collects data from every Post Office branch's computer system (Horizon) including payment information,
closing cash totals within the branch, broken down by each note and coin denomination, plus cash

returned/delivered to and from the branch

The SapADS system then calculates cash requirements for each branch, depending on historical data, by
forecasting daily cash requirements up to and including the next service day. So the system will either ask for a
certain amount of cash to be returned from the branch or wilt calculate how much cash to send out. This is

known as the Planned Order.

A message is then sent to a branch's Horizon system notifying them that they will be sent ‘X’ amount of cash or
that they need to send ‘X’ amount of cash back to the cash centre. This message is only sent the day before the

service is due.

Continuation Statement of David DIXON

From my knowledge of our computer distribution system (SapADS) I am able to export information regarding
historical requests to return cash. I can also extract what each Post Office had actually returned. Comparing the
calculated request to return, and what had actually been returned, I can isolate branches that had returned
much less than the requested amounts. From this difference, I can work out which branches were most at risk,
in that they were reportedly holding excessive amounts of cash. I would then contact branches to find out why

they were not returning the requested cash.

From our ReCALL logging system I can see an entry which shows that on 07 March 2011, I telephoned
Rowlands Castle Sub Post Office Branch (SPOB), branch code 107 937 and requested that they return £30,000
the following day. I can then see from this system that on 09 March 2011 I have made an entry stating that the
branch failed to comply with the request to return £30,000 and as such I requested that an audit be conducted
at that branch. From business records I can see that they actually returned £14,000 on 08 March 2011. On the

ReCALL system I can see a further two entries against this branch which were both dated 31 March 2011 and

deal with the office being closed and the suspension of Mrs Lynette Hutchings. I now produce a copy of those
four ReCALL entries as item DD/1.
