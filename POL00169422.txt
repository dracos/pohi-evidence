Subject: Urgent update required
Attachment: Horizon audit HD.xIs
Dear All

Can I please ask for your help urgently. I have been asked to provide an update
on the attached cases where Horizon integrity has come into question and need
the information by tomorrow.

I have checked against the spreadsheet but am unable to cover off the "gaps"
which are namely

Court case Details
Result
Accused's Defence (exactly)

Could you either add into the spreadsheet using bright pink font as I have done
in the recoveries column or just pop updates on an email and I will collate

Many thanks

Jane
