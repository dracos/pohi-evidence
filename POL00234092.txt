To see. I'll look into it but as you know he has been doing this sort of thing for years (and is now doing a regular blog
etc). He is in touch with Nick Wallis and others. There's been a couple of things on Twitter recently about current
Horizon probs (which are known and all bau etc, no postmasters adversely affected).

Dear Paula
This may be the last you hear from me directly.

It is a last chance for you to accept what I have been telling you these last few years
is true.

I now have clear and unquestionable evidence of an intermittent bug in Horizon that
can and does cause thousands of pounds losses to subpostmasters.

Tonight there is a branch in your network sitting on a loss of 5 figures. The money
does not exist. It is a result of several one sided transactions being entered
erroneously by the system not the operator.

I have documentation from POL employees acknowledging the error and that it has
happened before.

I have the source documentation from the subpostmaster concerned.

I have evidence of a similar event happening two years ago. It is also documented. I
have a limited channel of contacts in the Industry. Two similar events (plus the
admission by your employee that he is aware of other events) is a high percentage,
and the error soon to be exposed will result in more coming to light.

Most importantly it is an error that would not be noticed by many subpostmasters and
could well be the reason for many of the JFSA cases.

I have three options.

a) this email is the first option - appeal to your sense of decency and compassion to
accept that many of the claimants in the JFSA sage are honest and decent citizens
whose lives were destroyed by your organisation.

b) go to the press and see what happens

or

c) await the inevitable judicial review where you will personally be exposed and
perhaps leave yourself open to criminal charges.

We can stop this farce now. You can wake up and realise that the people you rely on
POL00234092
POL00234092

to tell you the truth about what is happening don't have the ability to do so.

Option b) happens on Friday. I have one former SPMR who is keen to proceed with a
JR. Option c) could happen sooner than you think.

You have two options:

a) ignore this email and accept the consequences

b) Travel with me to the Branch in question. See for yourself the evidence. Talk with
the subpostmaster concerned and reach your own conclusion. I want nothing out of
this and will meet my own costs.

Your call

Tim
