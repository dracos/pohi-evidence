Dear all, I have mentioned the Second Sight Part Two Report which they sent us in draft and to which we
responded requiring them to let us know how they plan to respond. They did not respond and issued a final
report today for issue to applicants. I attach it for information. It has not gone out and we have again gone to the
Chair of the Working Group to say it should not be issued until the Working Group have had a chance to
discuss further. I do not know how he will respond.

However, it has gone to JFSA although at this stage is confidential,produced for mediation. The quality of the
report speaks for itself.

We have a draft rebuttal statement to send to applicants and are working on a detailed response on all the points.
We also have a letter ready to go to Second Sight about future arrangements for their engagement. However, I
wanted to share this with you now as you will want to consider whether there are any steps you need to take in
relation to business partners such as Bol.

I will revert in the morning when I have a view from the Chair about whether he is prepared to delay this.

It has gone to Fujitsu and they have asked to catch up in the morning on this.

Best wishes
Belinda
