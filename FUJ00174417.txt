Guys

I need you to take a look at this if you haven't seen the Programme already.

Undoubtedly, Horizon integrity remains a core to our safe operation and to date, nothing has surfaced that suggests
there is any evidence that the system is flawed in anyway. Can we briefly just talk through these latest developments.

Thanks

Mike
