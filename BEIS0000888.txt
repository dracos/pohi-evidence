ortfall Scheme - Fixed Sum Awards - OFFICIAL

SENSITIV!
OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE

Hi Jamie, Jason,

With thanks to those in copy, please find attached Ministerial Advice seeking agreement to
implement the £75k Fixed Sum on the Horizon Shortfall Scheme (HSS). This is for
consideration by 1) Minister Thomas and 2) Secretary of State.

We will be submitting Accounting Officer advice on this issue to the Permanent Secretary
shortly, following final clearances. AO clearance is required before proceeding. We will also
provide advice in the next few days on the proposal for an independent appeals process for
the HSS. We expect both issues to be raised by Kevin Hollinrake during next week's redress
announcement.

Lead private secretary: Jamie Cunningham

Submission title: FOR DECISION: Horizon Shortfall Scheme Fixed Sum Awards
Timing: We would be grateful for a swift readout. Post Office has received regular
correspondence from postmasters awaiting payment of the £75k fixed sum following the

March announcement and we expect it to be raised during next week's redress
announcement.

Summary: This note seeks your agreement on delivering a fixed sum award to provide
redress to postmasters participating in the Horizon Shortfall Scheme.

Recommendation: That Ministers agree to:

a) Implementing your predecessors’ announcement to introduce a Fixed Sum
BEIS0000888
BEIS0000888

Award of £75k to HSS claimants, to bring the scheme in line with the GLO scheme.

b) Capping awards at £50k where postmasters reject the Fixed Sum and are
offered a lower amount, with no option to return to the Fixed Sum.

c) Not providing legal advice to claimants to consider the offer of a fixed sum.

d) Consider whether to delay the introduction of the Fixed Sum Award until we
have clarity from HMT on funding for HSS Appeals, noting that this could take several
weeks or months.

e) Note the revised application process set out in paragraph 17.

Annexes: Annex A — Financial Impact

Cleared by: Carl Creswell — Director, Post Office and Business Engagement

Let me know if you have any questions. Happy to discuss.

Many thanks,

OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE
