THE POST OFFICE GROUP LITIGATION
IN THE HIGH COURT OF JUSTICE

QUEEN’S BENCH DIVISION

BETWEEN:
ALAN BATES AND OTHERS Claimants
AND
POST OFFICE LIMITED Defendant

FOURTEENTH WITNESS STATEMENT OF

ANDREW PAUL PARSONS

I, Andrew Paul Parsons of Oceana House, 39-49 Commercial Road, Southampton,
$015 1GA WILL SAY as follows:

Introduction

1. I am a partner at Womble Bond Dickinson (UK) LLP, solicitors for the Defendant
(Post Office) in the above proceedings. I am duly authorised to make this
statement in support of Post Office's application for an order that the Honourable
Mr. Justice Fraser be recused as the Managing Judge of the Post Office Group
Litigation. The facts set out in this statement are within my own knowledge.

2. In this statement I refer to copy documents attached and marked Exhibit AP14.
Structure of this litigation

3. As the Court will be aware, these proceedings are being managed in stages. The
Managing Judge is the Hon. Mr Justice Fraser (the Judge).

4. It was ordered that the nature of the legal relationship between Subpostmasters
and Post Office should be determined first. Paragraph 1 of the Court's Order of

AC_154900148_3 1
Claim No: HQ16X01238, HQ17X02637 & HQ17X04248

25 October 2017 provided that there “shall be a trial of common issues, to
determine issues relating to the legal relationship between the parties” (the
Common Issues, to be tried at the Common Issues Trial) (AP 14/1). Schedule 1
to that Order listed those “common issues” (AP 14/13).

That Order, at paragraph 34, also scheduled a further ‘trial of substantive issues’
for 11 March 2019 (AP 14/10).

Schedule 1 to the Court's Order of 23 March 2018 listed a set of issues regarding
the operation of Horizon to be determined at the March 2019 trial (the Horizon
Issues, to be tried at the Horizon Trial) (AP14/26). That trial is ongoing at the

time of drafting this statement

In broad summary, the Horizon Issues cover:
a. The likelihood of errors in Horizon (Issues 1, 3, 4, 6);

b. How the Horizon system reported / allowed discovery of errors in Horizon
(Issues 2, 8, 9, 14(a));

c. How Horizon compares transaction data and processes transaction
corrections (Issues 5 and 15);

d. How Horizon deals with shortfalls and disputes (Issue 14(b) and (c));

e. How Horizon interacts with the Branch Trading Statement (Issue 14(d) and
(e));
f. The extent to which Post Office / the IT company with which it contracted

(Fujitsu) could remotely access and/or alter Horizon data (Issues 7, 10 to 13).

A further Order, dated 20 February 2019, provided, at paragraph 1, for the
determination of further issues, principally pertaining to limitation and breach
(AP 14/30) at a trial listed for November 2019.

On 15 March 2019, the Court handed down judgment following the Common
Issues Trial (the Judgment).

Scope of the Common Issues Trial

10.

As noted above, the Common Issues were described in the 25 October 2017
Order as relating to the parties’ legal relationship. That has been reiterated by the
Judge, who described the Common Issues (a) at a hearing on 2 February 2018,
as dealing with “the contractual relations’ (p.24H, AP14/61); (b) at a hearing on
22 February 2018, as “purely points of construction” (p.9D, AP14/85).

Claim No: HQ16X01238, HQ17X02637 & HQ17X04248

The Common Issues are, in summary:

a.

Issues as to contractual construction / implication, governing good faith
(Issue 1); training; support; provision of Horizon; the helplines provided by
Post Office; the investigation of shortfalls; communication of bugs; recovery
of shortfalls; suspension; termination (Issues 2, 3, 4 and 14 to 20);
Subpostmasters’ liability for losses (Issues 8 and 9), Post Office’s discretion
over whether to appoint a prospective purchaser of a Subpostmaster's
branch as the next Subpostmaster (Issue 21), Subpostmasters' assistants
(Issues 22 and 23).

Mixed issues of construction and common law, as to whether and to what
extent agency principles apply to Subpostmasters and/or Post Office (Issues
10 to 13).

Issues as to the status of various terms, i.e. whether they are onerous and
unusual and/ or invalid under the Unfair Contract Terms Act (Issues 5 and 7).

If and insofar as any terms are found to be onerous and unusual, what steps
Post Office needed to take to bring them to Subpostmasters’ attention (Issue
6).

As to the structure of the Common Issues Trial, the 25 October 2017 Order
specified:

a.

b.

At paragraph 7, that the parties should choose 6 Lead Claimants (AP14/4).

At paragraph 8, that the parties should serve, ‘“[ijn respect of each Lead
Claimant and in relation to the Common Issues’, Individual Particulars of
Claim, Defences and Replies (AP 14/4).

At paragraph 10, that the parties should serve, ‘[ijn respect of each Lead
Claimant and in relation to the Common Issues’, witness statements
(AP 14/5).

At paragraph 4, that some disclosure should be given in respect of Claimants
identified as potential Lead Claimants (AP14/2).

Further, disclosure was controlled by reference to the Common Issues. See the
transcript of the hearing of 22 February 2018, at which the Judge, when deciding
whether to order disclosure of specific items, considered whether they were
“relevant to the Common Issues”: see e.g. p.26B (AP 14/102); p.46G (AP 14/122).

Dispute over admissibility of evidence

14. The six Lead Claimants served Individual Particulars of Claim on 13 April 2018
(pursuant to paragraph 8 of the Order dated 25 October 2017 (AP14/4), as
amended by paragraph 1 of the Order dated 20 March 2018 (AP14/159)).

15. In its Individual Defences, Post Office noted that the Claimants’ pleadings went
far beyond the scope of the Common Issues Trial. Post Office specifically
identified, as inadmissible and/or irrelevant content, those parts of the pleadings
which dealt with training, helplines, the introduction and withdrawal by Post Office
of specific products or services for sale in the branch, the Claimants’ experiences
of shortfalls, Post Office's investigations of shortfalls, and terminations. See, for
example, Individual Defence to Mr Abdulla’s claim, at paragraph 2 (AP14/161).

16. At a hearing on 22 February 2018, the Judge said, at 9D-E: “/ thought I made this
crystal clear last time but I appear not to have done so I am going to repeat
myself, so far as resolving the Common Issues which are, and I have reminded
myself what they are, purely points of construction... On the authorities the only
factual matrix which is relevant to construe the meaning of those contracts in law
is common knowledge. That is without doubt orthodox and the correct way of
doing it.” (AP 14/85) He also said, at p.48A, that “what happened or what should
have happened is not relevant to construing the Common Issues’ (AP 14/124)

17. At a hearing on 5 June 2018, Post Office expressed continuing concerns that the
pleadings indicated that the Claimants intended to adduce wide swathes of
irrelevant evidence. In response, the Judge gave the Claimants the following
warnings:

a. At p.57E-F: “Whatever the factual evidence upon which you seek to rely it
has to be relevant to the Common Issues... If it is not relevant to the
Common Issues it is not admissible... In those circumstances it is difficult
based on reading the authorities to see for example, to use Mr. Cavender's
example, how evidence of breach could remotely be relevant to the Common
Issues Trial.” (AP14/271)

b. At p.59C-E: “So this is what I am going to do. I am going to express myself
very clearly. If you serve evidence of fact which includes passages which are
plainly not relevant and, hence, not admissible, Mr. Cavender is going to
have a choice. He can either simply say, "I am not going to be
cross-examining at all" or he is going to issue an application to have it struck
out. If he does issue an application to have it struck out and that application
is effective, it will involve the court going through it and simply striking out
large amounts. The court will make time to do that but cringing costs
consequences will follow.” (AP 14/273)

Claim No: HQ16X01238, HQ17X02637 & HQ17X04248

c. At p.60A, he warned against the adducing of “wide-ranging evidence of
fact...that cannot possibly form part of the factual matrix.” (AP 14/274)

d. At p.60C: “a very powerful shot has now been fired across your bows on two
occasions and I do not mean by [counsel for Post Office]. I mean by me.”
(AP 14/274)

Nonetheless, on 24 August 2018, the Lead Claimants served witness statements
which covered all of this ground, in effect telling the ‘whole story’ through to
termination (served pursuant to paragraph 10 of the Order dated 25 October 2017
(AP14/5), as amended by paragraph 1 of the Order dated 10 August 2018
(AP 14/282).

Accordingly, Post Office applied to strike out large parts of the Claimants’
evidence (AP14/284).

That application was refused by the Judge on 17 October 2018: Bates v Post
Office [2018] EWHC 2698 (QB). At paragraph 52 of that judgment, the Judge said
the following:

“as a result of admitting this evidence (by which the defendant means failing
to find it inadmissible and striking it out) the court will either find itself asked,
or will make, findings on matters that are in reality to be dealt with in the
Horizon Issues trial, or in the later trials that are to deal with specific breach,
loss and damage alleged by the individual Lead Claimants. I do not accept
that there is such a risk... There is no such risk of the court making findings on
the Horizon Issues, or of the court making findings on breach. Judges are
expected to be able to consider relevant matters pertaining to different issues,
keeping them compartmentalised where necessary...! consider this point to
be an exceptionally weak one. The court will not find itself making findings
almost by accident, which is what the defendant came perilously close to
submitting.”

Post Office’s position at Common Issues Trial

21.

At the Common Issues Trial, Post Office continued to make very clear its position
that no findings should be made which went beyond the proper scope of the
Common Issues Trial. The key extracts from Post Office’s Written Opening
submissions, Oral Opening submissions, Written Closing submissions and Oral
Closing submissions are at Annex 1 to this statement.

STATE

I believe that th

Signed:

Date:

Notwithstanding the above, the Judgment made findings, or observations, on a
wide range of matters which properly fall to be decided at the Horizon Issues Trial
or at future breach trials.

They include findings and observations on such matters as the adequacy of
training, the quality of helplines, Post Office’s alleged knowledge of problems with
Horizon, the cause of shortfalls, how easy or difficult it was for Subpostmasters to
discover the cause of shortfalls, Post Office’s investigations of shortfalls, the
circumstances of individual Claimants’ suspensions and terminations, and
whether Post Office sent unjustified demands for payment and/or threats of legal
action to Subpostmasters.

These findings give the clear impression that the Judge has already formed a firm
view on these matters. It is to be expected that this will prevent him from taking an
impartial view on the same matters when they are revisited, at subsequent trials,
with the benefit of full evidence and disclosure.

The Judgment also contains a great deal of critical invective directed at Post
Office, none of which is relevant to the determination of the Common Issues.
That, too, creates a clear impression that the Judge has not behaved impartially.
The same can be said for those parts of the judgment which harshly criticise Post
Office’s witnesses on matters irrelevant to the Common Issues.

In those circumstances, Post Office believes it has no choice but to make this
application for the Judge to recuse himself from these proceedings. As an adjunct
to that, Post Office applies for an adjournment of the ongoing Horizon Trial.

Annex 1: Extracts from Post Office’s submissions at the Common Issues Trial

Written Opening submissions

27. In its written opening submissions Post Office sought to remind the Court that (at

paragraphs 29-31 (AP 14/296):

“29. This trial is the first stage in the resolution of the issues in the group litigation.
It necessarily precedes the determination of issues as to the functions and
reliability of the Horizon system and the determination of matters going to breach

of contract and liability in individual cases.

30. The Court confirmed in Judgment No. 2 that it would not be drawn into
“making findings on the Horizon Issues, or...making findings on breach” at the
present trial (para. 52). Post Office welcomes that ruling. Post Office anticipates
that Cs’ case on the supposed relevance of its breach allegations to the Common

Issues will become more fully articulated at trial.

31. In any event, it will be important for the parties not to stray into issues that fall
to be determined at the Horizon trial and/or issues as to breach. The Court will
recall that Post Office has not adduced any evidence at this trial to make good its
case on Horizon; nor has it sought to address in evidence the various breach
allegations that appear in Cs’ witness evidence. Post Office has not prepared for
a trial on Horizon or a trial on breach. The function of this trial is not to reach any

findings on those issues, or on facts that go to those issues.”

Oral Opening submissions

28. This position was reiterated in oral opening submissions (See p.165/1 to 166/11,

AP 14/445):

"You will see what we said in our written opening about things that it would be
useful -- findings to make and not to make. In your number two judgment you
made it clear you are not making findings on the breach allegations or allegations

about Horizon.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: Everyone is agreed about that

MR CAVENDER: See paragraph 52. What I also ask that you don't do is make
any findings of fact that go to -- are ancillary to those breach allegations or
Horizon allegations, rather than the Common Issues. Otherwise, again, you have
the difficulty of overlap and arguments about issue estoppel and all these kinds of

things.

POL00269105
POL00269105
Claim No: HQ16X01238, HQ17X02637 & HQ17X04248

MR JUSTICE FRASER: It depends what you mean by findings of fact that go to
breach. I imagine, if there are any necessary findings of fact at the end of the
evidence in terms of disputes of fact as to whether Mr Bates got document X, you

won't want me to leave that floating in the air, will you?
MR CAVENDER: My Lord, no. That goes to my first category of --

MR JUSTICE FRASER: I know that and I haven't yet bottomed that out with Mr
Green. Because, on one view, a finding of fact that goes to breach could involve
any finding of fact in relation to the contractual relationship, couldn't it ?

MR CAVENDER: But what I am talking about is downstream. So the training
wasn't good enough, that they didn't have sufficient report writing, that they didn't
have enough help with investigations; all those things that are downstream.
Potentially breach. We haven't brought the evidence to the trial to deal with it.
There hasn't been full disclosure on some of these issues. So we won't be
dealing -- and this has been our persistent position -- obviously this is a trial about
the contract and the relationship. Those are my submissions. Obviously the court
will do what it will do."

Written Closing submissions

29.

Post Office's closing written submissions also made a number of points on the
scope of the Common Issues Trial — see paras 31 to 51 (AP14/463-472) and
paras 126 to 131 (AP14/499-500). In particular,

“It remains acutely important not to stray into issues that fall to be determined at
the Horizon Trial and/or future trials on breach and liability. The Court will recall
that Post Office has not adduced any evidence at this trial to make good its case
on Horizon; nor has it sought to address in evidence the various breach
allegations that appear in Cs’ witness evidence. Post Office has not prepared for
a trial on Horizon or a trial on breach. It has not, for example, led expert evidence
on Horizon, and it has not provided anything like the accounting evidence that it
would lead at a liability trial. The function of this trial is not to reach any findings
on those issues, or on facts that go to those issues.” (AP14/465)

“In this context, it was wholly unfair and unattractive for Cs to criticise Post
Office’s witnesses for having failed to address irrelevant material in their witness
statements: see, e.g., the implied criticism of Ms Van Den Bogerd far not having
addressed in her witness statement various internal Post Office documents that
have been disclosed {Day8/165:12}, despite the fact that such documents are
irrelevant to the Common Issues and any evidence in relation to them would be
inadmissible. Ms Van Den Bogerd’s witness statement was of course prepared in

light of the limited permission to file and serve evidence “in relation to Common

Issues”: see para. 10 of the First CMC Order {B7/7/5}. She makes clear in the
witness statement itself that her evidence is limited to matters that she considers
could have been known or anticipated by an applicant SPM at the time of
contracting: see, e.g., para 64 (in relation to the operation of an agency branch)
{C2/1/17}, paras 91-98 (in relation to Horizon) {C2/1/27}, paras 114-115 (in
relation to further training and support) {C2/1/32} and para 116 (in relation to retail
“shrinkage”) {C2/1/33}. She was careful not to trespass onto the Horizon Issues:
see, e.g., Fn. 22 and 24 {C2/1/23}. It is perverse to aiticise a witness for seeking
to comply with a direction as to the scope of evidence and for limiting herself to
admissible evidence. Ms Van Den Bogerd of course had the benefit of advice as
to the proper scope of her evidence: {Day9/73:7} to line 14." (AP 14/465)

Oral Closing submissions

30. Finally it was addressed in oral closing submissions (see Day 14, p.27/18 — 28/2
(AP 14/680); p.32/24 — 35/9 (AP14/681-682); p.52/1 - 52/17 (AP14/686); p.63/11

p.27/18 — 28/2 (AP14/680)

"MR JUSTICE FRASER: And you don't take post-contractual matters into account
on either footing.

MR CAVENDER: Or hindsight or views from hindsight. You have to ask the right
question. The right question is not: well, is it reasonable? You don’t ask: well,
what term should be implied in light of what happened in fact? That is the mistake
made in Bou Simon by the First Instance that the Court of Appeal identified. And
there is a real risk of doing that here - -

MR JUSTICE FRASER: I don't think there is .

MR CAVENDER: It’s an easy mistake to make as Bou Simon shows. There is a
lot of evidence here of that nature. My learned friend has put his case both in
cross-examination and his closings on that basis. So you have a yawning
invitation to make a mistake and it is my job to try and prevent that happening and
I intend to try and do that. But in doing that, you have to be very careful what
question you ask and what evidence you have regard to when you ask it will just
divert a moment and put some skin on those bones. When you are looking at
implied terms particularly, my learned friend is fascinated by doing it in the guts of
the dispute and the thing going wrong. When you know a lot more detail - - and at
that stage you would be able to identify certain cardinal obligations and things that
have gone wrong and try and put them right. “Tempting but wrong”, in the words
of M&S.

At the stage you're contracting you know very much less. You have a very high
level view of what you expect. So the very notion of being able to imply precise
terms dealing with suggested infelicities or difficulties down the line is itself wrong
headed because you wouldn't be able to do that"

p.32/24 — 35/9 (AP14/681-682)

"MR CAVENDER: ...We also say it was somewhat cynical of the claimants to
take this approach because there has not been full disclosure on either side
dealing with the issues they now seem to want to be dealt with. In particular, what
we call the breach allegations, we only have a few documents that happen to be
caught in the net of the word searches. Your Lordship should not think that we
have full disclosure on all these issues. We do not. And the real temptation here
is to think you have and to draw inferences from an incomplete documentary
record, incomplete evidence, which would in my submission be obviously wrong.

So, for instance, your Lordship should not be fooled into thinking there has been
anything like proper disclosure on allegations as to training or shortfalls or
investigations. Your Lordship did not order such disclosure, there has not been
such disclosure, and Post Office has not led evidence on those issues. My
learned friend has put questions on those areas - -

MR JUSTICE FRASER: You have led evidence on training.

MR CAVENDER: My Lord, only very, very high level. I think it was a couple of
paragraphs --

MR JUSTICE FRASER: Quite a lot of your evidence was high level in some
areas, and I'm not criticising, I'm observing, but you did lead evidence on training.

MR CAVENDER: My Lord, only just high level evidence. If you wanted evidence
on training, we would have evidence from trainers and the proper documentary
record of the plans et cetera. All we did was have a few slides, that wasn't proper
evidence. The other thing about training of course is it is wholly irrelevant. Why?
Because my learned friend's case is that all the contracts were made in advance
of even initial training, let alone subsequent training, so the whole question is
wholly irrelevant.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: The irrelevance point I understand, but it is wrong to

submit you didn’t put in any evidence on training - -
MR CAVENDER: We didn't put any proper evidence on training - -

MR JUSTICE FRASER: Mr Cavender, there is no distinction between putting in
evidence and putting in proper evidence. You might have a point that it could

have been more comprehensive ~~

MR CAVENDER: There has been no disclosure on training.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: There might not have been. But you did put in evidence
on training because some passages of your witness statements expressly deal
with training.

MR CAVENDER: My Lord, yes, there is a paragraph or two in Mrs Van Den
Bogerd’s statement that on a very high level says. But not evidence of training
where your Lordship can make any finding. Her evidence is about what could
have been known or anticipated at the date of inception, that is what her evidence
goes to if you look at it, not the actual experience of training, how good or bad it
was, were shortfalls dealt with in sufficient detail, which is the point my learned
friend wants it for.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: By "date of inception ”, do you mean...

MR CAVENDER: The contractual date.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: The contractual date.

MR CAVENDER: Indeed. That is why it is so general."

p.52/4 - 52/17 (AP14/686)

"MR CAVENDER: The bright line I am making is issues of breach really.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: You are saying don't go near findings that relate to
breach, is that right?

MR CAVENDER: Indeed.
MR JUSTICE FRASER: Is that the best way of summarising it?

MR CAVENDER: It is, and we said that at the beginning. And your Lordship said
in judgment 2 you are not going to make findings on breach, and I said good,
obviously, but also don't make findings of fact leading to those questions of
breach. Not obviously whether there is a contract or not, you could - - if you took
that too far . But not in directly leading up to findings on breach, or would do.
Platforms of fact that would lead to that.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: Understood."
p.63/11 — 65/1 (AP 14/689):

"MR CAVENDER: So in summary on important points of this introduction in terms
of scope, the court should not have regard to post-contractual evidence, evidence
of breach, for two distinct reasons: firstly, to do so would involve a basic error of
law, and, secondly, would involve a serious procedural irregularity. It would do the

AC_154900148_3 11
POL00269105
POL00269105

Claim No: HQ16X01238, HQ17X02637 & HQ17X04248

second because the orders of the court setting out the issues for trial and the
issues on which evidence were to be admitted is set out in the Common Issues.

The Statements of Case have been ordered to be limited to those issues, see
paragraph 8, and the witness statements were limited to those issues, see
paragraph 10. That is the trial Post Office has attended and involved itself in. It
has not engaged in wide-ranging evidence on breach, which the claimants have,
and so not only would it be an error of law to have regard to it, it would also be
procedurally unfair for that reason. Because in the absence of full disclosure on
matters such as the dispute, Horizon, accounting, procedures, deficits, training
and Helpline, without full evidence and disclosure on all those points, the court
should not engage in inferential findings or comments along the way. It shouldn't
do so as a matter of procedural faimess but also particularly given there are two
other trials that have been loaded in the system effectively on Horizon and on
breach, where on those very matters there will be full disclosure, there will be full
evidence and there will be determinations.

The other point I mentioned I think earlier was whether you should also be careful
because of the nature of the way it has been set up - - we had a humorous
debate about whether it was odd or not, but whether you should make comments
as well about “be careful to”, because, otherwise, an independent observer might
think, wrongly obviously, that the comments you make are a route along the way
to reaching a particular view or a finding, which you would then have to find in
judgment two or three - - sorry, in trial two or three . So again there is that
sensitivity, which your Lordship no doubt will obviously have in mind."
