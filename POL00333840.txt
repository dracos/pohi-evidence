Subject: Horizon training

Dear Gavin

Just to let you know that my HOL training went well yesterday. I was at Guildford until a little short of 2pm. I would
not say that I am now equipped to run a sub-post office but it gave me great insight into how the system works in
practice.

Both Andy and a man called Chris who was the trainer were extremely helpful. I have asked Andyto see if he can get
me any policy or guidance documents POL may have on the recruitment process for SPMRs, also about the HOL
training regime which has a number of phases and elements to it, and any HOL training manual/guidance notes and
such like. I have asked in all cases to channel material through you so that you are not unsighted by what I am
receiving.

Once I have received my confirmed terms of reference I can start thinking of progressing. There are however items
and materials, as you'll recall, I sought and am awaiting arising from our meeting with CK a week or so ago.

Best wishes,

Brian
