Subject: FW: POST OFFICE PRESS COVERAGE from Andrea Clatworthy / UKI2013-103

Gentlemen,

In case you are asked. The Post Office has been subject to an enquiry regarding how they work with their branch
outlets and the fact that they take some of them to court when they suspect fraud.

In many cases their branch people have blamed their fraud on the Post Office IT system. This has never been proven
and the Post Office remain convinced their IT is in good shape.

An interim report has been commissioned by Post Office which demonstrates that our system works well.

Please see attached more information. We have alerted IB comms and Tokyo PR teams.

Re: POST OFFICE® PRESS COVERAGE

You may have seen some press coverage last night and today concerning Post Office® and
their IT system. Like many situations like this, there is much more to the story than the headline
often implies. However, as with many customers, we have an agreement for all enquires to go
via the Post Office team, so Fujitsu will not be commenting publicly. If you receive anything from
the media please redirect them to James Millen in our Press Team, who is in
contact with the Post Office Press Team.

In the case of customers, we would like to stick to the same approach, so if your customers do
ask about the situation, please refer them to these quotes which are already in the public
domain:

Paula Vennells CEO Post Office:

"The Post Office is committed to supporting its people and improving the way we do so. The
interim review makes clear that the Horizon computer system and its supporting processes
function effectively across our network. As the review notes, it is used by around 68,000 people
in more than 11,500 branches, successfully processing more than six million transactions every
day. The review underlines our cause for confidence in the overall system. “

James Arbuthnot MP:
‘It seems at the moment that Horizon itself has worked as it is meant to.”

Quote on the BBC:
“The review found no evidence of systemic problems with the core software.”

And the Post Office statement on their website.

We hope this should be sufficient for most cases, but if your customer requires more
information, please speak — in the first instance — with Haydn Jones, the Client Managing
Director for the Post Office account.
