1 SUMMARY

e Live service is operating successfully within SLA and with no major customer

satisfaction issues.

¢ S06 counter migration progressing well

e Implementation tail is running to target with 34 outlets remaining to install. Achieving
100% by end-October is at risk unless there is some positive action by Post Office

in managing some of their PM’s.

The rebuild of the wings and COR1 is now complete although the rebuild of COR1

experienced numerous issues.

The install of the final part of the OCMS kit is complete.

The initial costing for NWB are complete.

S06 counter migration was started, regressed and is now going extremely well.

1.2 PROGRESS

1.2.1 Operations and Support

Another good month for data and file delivery, with an expected Day D TIP
achievement in the region of 99.6%.

The rebuild of the wings and COR 1 are now complete although the rebuild of COR1
was extremely problematic.

Energis achieved their 99.95% ISDN availability target for the first time in a year . There
is also an improvement in VSAT availability (99.52%) although this is still not
satisfactory. The removal of CLIP is now complete.

The trend with regard to non-polled offices is continuing to improve and work is
progressing on the revision of the procedures to take into account counter and network
improvements as part of the Day D rectification plan.

The Host fail-over business continuity test was successfully completed. A meeting was
held with Martyn Bennett with regard to hand-over of Pathway business continuity.
However CSs ability to carry out this function is severely affected by the withdrawal of
authorisation to recruit an additional business continuity head. Possible solutions are
being investigated but currently this remains a major area of risk.

Reference data continues to run well and message broadcasts are running at 1 per day
on average. Work is well on the way on proving the Scavenger Agents. The first of the
3 RDT data streams has now been scavenged with a number of code bugs having
been found and corrected.

Monthly Report - July 2001 Issue: 1.0
Date: 31/07/2001

There are now 15 AP clients of which 12 have been migrated from HAPS and we are
now delivering over 50% of transactions direct to clients rather than HAPS. File
transfers are generally good but with occasional problems with individual clients

Progress on the Quantum gas termination problem continues. A check of the current
keyboards has identified a further 100 which require swapping. This is due to be
completed before the end of August.

The new CSR+ CTO Service CCN has now been signed off and the forecast is due to
be available end-January. The deadline in end-February when the PON-Sema HAPS
contract terminates.

The ongoing relationship with SAPADS continues to be problematic. They have yet to
provide us with a clear understanding of their plans and progress and attendance at
Service Review Forums remains sporadic. There are still anomalies in Daily Cash on
Hand and Weekly Stock on Hand reporting but the fixes will not go in until after S10.
Amendment of the LFS SLAs will need to be progressed following acceptance of the
rectification plan.

The backlog service of around 80 icons have been released into the estate in SO6.
Agreement has been reached with Escher re the IPR regarding the in-house produced
YG icons. These have now been released by PON and will be released to the estate
mid-August. There is still work to be done in agreeing the ongoing service with Escher.

1.2.2 Infrastructure Services

The revaluation exercise at the start of the month resulted in a significant increase of
calls abandoned/engaged.

The review of System Service remedial calls has now been completed with agreement
reached up to 3% week of April. Revised invoice notes will be issued to commercial
within the next fortnight. HSH are continuing to work on a remedial statement for
software calls from Sept 2000 to April 2001. The September figure will be used to
calculate the value payable for the previous 3 months. The remedy database is now
working effectively.

YG MIS provision is now going according to plan with positive comments from the YG
MIS team.

MSU have achieved 100% BIMS incident management SLA target for July!

A total of 416 sites have been visited by the FSM team in July. At a recent meeting with
PON the team were described a ‘..a real success story and one of the high spots of
Horizon’. Assistance to the SSC is still being provided by FSM in the investigation into
‘phantom transactions’ with on-site visits being planned where necessary. The FSM
team is also providing assistance in the resolution of the ‘slow running counters’
problem. 50 sites have been contacted to determine if M1 has helped but in many
cases no improvement is being reported. On-site visits are being arranged.

Christine McKay contacted a site in Scotland regarding the complaint they had logged
with the help-desk, only to find their call had been wrongly categorised. The site had

called to compliment HSH but as there was no appropriate category it had been marked
as a complaint.

It is expected that Single Point of Contact will be implemented end August .
This month has seen the introduction of the Management Care Visit process

A counter news article was issued end-July to address several of the A&G type
problems. MSU will track call categories to see if there is an improvement.

There were a total of 189 OBC orders for July (137 in June).

There are now 34 outlets left remaining from the tail with a disproportionate amount of
rescheduling due to PM’s withholding approval. There is now a risk that we will not
achieve our end-date of end October and the contractual date of end-November unless

PON get a grip of this. This is now being escalated to PON with a weekly status report
being provided.

1.2.3 Security Management

Work is continuing on implementing anti-virus software on the estate.

Discussion on NB security requirements continue with Post Office with outputs being
fed into SDS and SRS. Recent changes to the latest version of the Reqts catalogue will
require significant input in the area of data retrieval.

Rules of Engagement for YG penetration testing have now been agreed.

1.2.4 Service Introduction

Work is commencing on the implementation plans for BIl1/2/3 and non-functional
requirements for Network Banking. Initial costs have now been completed and are
being reviewed. Work is continuing of SLAs with the completion of 2 workshops with
the customer

The YG Contents Hosting service CCNis expected to be agreed this week. Installation
of GGP forms printing going well and first drop of revised forms has now gone out.

After an initial problem which resulted in a fix being backed out, SO6 counter migration
is progressing well.

S10 data centre and counter planning is ongoing. The EMC and Dynix upgrades have
been deferred until BI2.

Telexus planning has now started.

1.2.5 Staffing

Eric Hillier has now joined Infrastructure Services as Problem Manager. Ed Willis has
joined as Release Controller. Steven Hustwayte is leaving

1.3. ISSUES and RISKS

The risk with YG is now reduced as the service progresses. However with the possibility
of Paul Curley leaving there is a substantial area of risk with regard to the ongoing
management of the service.

Work has progressed on the network banking SLAs . Correct scoping of SLAs will
remain a risk until work is complete on technical design of the solution.

Pathway-wide Business Continuity remains a risk due to resource constraints. Possible
solutions are being considered.

Responsibility for the resolution of environmental issues within post-offices remains a
concern. Lack of clarity re resolution route for these issues and liability needs to be
addressed. This has still to be progressed.

2.1 OPERATIONS & SUPPORT

2.1.1 Achievement Against SLA

FUJ00120516
FUJ00120516

2.1.1.1 Data File Delivery

July was a good month regarding delivery of all files to TIP, OBCS, HAPS & AP.
There were no major file delivery issues and we will be achieving 99.6% for DAY D to
TIP.

2.1.2 Network

The Energis achievement against SLA for June 2001 was as follows:

Backbone 99.99%
Client Links 100.00%
ISDN 99.95%
VSAT 99.52%

The ISDN availability shows a further improvement and is on SLA target for the first
time in a year. This improvement is in some part, due to the Service Improvement Plan
put together by Martin Southern of Energis, although due to the high number of
electrical storms during late June through to early July, it will be difficult to hit target
again in the immediate future.

ICL Pathway Customer Service Ref: CS/REP/0105
Monthly Report - July 2001 Issue: 1.0
Date: 31/07/2001

The previous downturn in VSAT performance has been reversed, although is still not
satisfactory.

Whilst using one months figures as a benchmark for Satellite Service, should not be
read into too much, (due to the small estate), these are still disappointing. Energis are
continuing with their Service Improvement Plan with HOT. One planned improvement,
is that HOT are expecting to expand their Engineer Support although this will take a
while to kick in, whilst another is that a satellite workshop has been arranged for the
end of August.

Non-Polled, has continued to show improvement since early March. There was
however a downturn during the last few days of June through until mid July due to the
aforementioned electrical storms. The overall picture is good with most of the few
double dayers being attributed to the PO. The long-term outlook is also promising with
the SMC (Richard Lumb in particular) being very proactive in continually looking at
longer-term improvements.

The removal of CLIP is almost complete, with no resultant problems.

2.1.3 Business Continuity

There are currently no open MBCls.
The test for Host fail over was successfully conducted, but the Campus Fail Over was
cancelled due to S06 issues and is now scheduled for the 11/12" August.

a. July saw the Business Continuity focus into updating several documents and
further work on the Bracknell Disaster Recovery workshop.

b. I Some progress was made on the Horizon Business Continuity plans.

c. Initial work has been undertaken in introducing and defining the Girobank DR
Gateway BC test.

2.1.4 Support

A number of activities relating to the management of the ACDB and other servers,
which had been undertaken by Implementation staff, have been transferred at very
short notice to the SSC.

The problematic rebuild of Correspondence Server 1 at Bootle required assistance from
SSC staff.

On YG John Simpkins , John Ballantyne, and Paul Steed have continued to be involved
as the solution gets rolled out to more Outlets Work has continued on the Interface
agreement between ICL Pathway and CGEY/PON for support.

Total calls raised through SSC - 346
Total calls closed through SSC - 391

2.1.5 Reference Data

Day to day service is running well.

GGP forms printing (Your Guide) - Amendments to 8 forms and new GGP icons are
with Release Management for scheduling (these are delivered as code, not as
reference data). PON OSG have coordinated the data for new GGP offices as per the
GGP rollout plan.

Message broadcasts continue to run at an average of 1 per day. However, the MBS e-
mails occasionally arrive several hours after they should.

AP Client migration continues. 90+ Girobank clients were migrated in July. CCN807
has been signed off (on 30 July) for the introduction of the new CTO services.

The SDS for Reference Data for Network Banking has been circulated to RDT — there
are still a large number of questions to be answered about where RDT fits into the
processes. RDT have been party to discussions concerning the data model, these are
at a very early stage.

Work is well underway on proving the Scavenger Agents. There are 3 data streams on
the RDT Rig, the first has been completely scavenged with data fixes made as
necessary. Input from RDT has led to a number of code bugs having been found (and
corrected) and a change to the procedure when anomalous data is found. The PON
OSG stream will be scavenged during August.

2.1.6 POCL Interfaces

During July the file transfers to HAPS were well within OLA deadline of 3 am.

APS Client Service. There are now fifteen AP clients of which twelve have been
migrated from HAPS. File transfers generally good — occasional problems with
individual clients: Quantum gateway, where a primary failure on 19/7 uncovered the
fact that files were waiting to be sent to Pathway; APS-SPM, where a Power failure on
2/7/01 prevented the transfer of the file. On 9/7/01, Girobank reported one file missing.
This was due to an FTP server timeout and the file was resent.

The Quantum Gas Termination problem: A check of the current keyboards identified a
further 100 keyboards which require swapping. This is due to be complete before the
end of August.

The new CSR+ CTO service. The CCN has just been sign-off & a plan is being
produced. The service is forecast to be available before the end of January. The
deadline is end Feb when the PON-SEMA HAPS contract terminates.

The TPS service is good. A fruitful meeting was held with PON on 23% July. A way
forward was agreed. A draft OLA was reviewed and a further meeting agreed for 4"
September, where it will be finalised. It is anticipated that the TIP service review will be
co-located with the existing Reconciliation Forum and terms of reference were
discussed on that basis.

Monthly Report - July 2001 Issue: 1.0
Date: 31/07/2001

The LFS service is good. However PON SAPADS still in pilot mode — and they have yet
to provide us with a clear understanding of their plans & progress. There is still an issue
with PON attendance at the Service Review Forum. Following the excellent attendance
at June's meeting, July was sparsely attended. There are still anomalies in the reporting
of Daily Cash on Hand and Weekly Stock on Hand, which are under investigation.
Despite being raised to A priority by Richard Brunskill to provide more focus, fixes have
missed S10. Amendment of the LFS SLAs is still an outstanding issue.

PON progress continues to be slow regarding setting up a "24/7" incident management
service at NBSC for APS & TPS, instead of via PON AP Service Management or the
“Bus Systems National Helpdesk”.

The Icon service: The “Backlog-batch” of approx. 80 icons are now being released to
the estate in Release S06. A CCN is to be raised to charge PON for the 7 for which
they have agreed to pay. Agreement was reached with Escher re their IPR regarding
the in-house produced “GGP icons”. These have been now approved by PON and are
in the S/W release pipeline for release mid August. There is significant work still to be
done to agree an ongoing service with PON - in particular a back-to-back agreement
with Escher. There is also a new batch of approx. 20 icons awaiting production.

2.1.7 AP Client Migration

2.2 INFRASTRUCTURE SERVICES

2.2.1 Achievement Against SLAs

2.2.1.1 Business Incident Management
Achievement for July 2001 is not expected to reach conformance of 100% due to on

going delays in acquiring data for receipts and payment incidents. BSU staff are to be
trained by SSC to enable them to handle themselves.

2.2.2 MSU

2.2.2.1 Service Performance

We have now completed our review of the System Service remedial calls - we have
reached agreement with PON up to and including the 3 week of April this year. Prior to
any re-issue of invoice and subsequent payments, MSU are in discussion with Pathway
Commercial regarding the weighting that must be applied to bring our revised payments
in line with any inflation adjustments that have occurred during the period. It is expected
that revised invoice notes will be issued to Commercial within the next fortnight. MSU
are submitting current month’s system service remedies to PON in accordance with the
time scale agreed.

HSH continue to work on providing a remedial statement for software calls from
September 2000 to April 2001. We are concentrating heavily on ensuring that the
September figure is as accurate as possible as this will be used as the basis to
calculate the value payable for the previous 9 months where it has been decided that
call data will not be directly scrutinised. With regard to the current submission of
software calls, from May 2001, they are being submitted with the hardware / network
calls to PON. I believe however, that PON are not yet in a position to conduct any call
analysis in respect of these software calls.

The remedy database is now working efficiently and ISD are using this as the sole
reference point for calculating the HW/ NW SLA conformance. MSU are now in a
position where all SLA reporting is sourced from the same data set and this should

Monthly Report - July 2001 Issue: 1.0
Date: 31/07/2001

ensure more accuracy within the reports. MSU are looking to enhance certain functions
within the database to capture individual suspension and delay times, rather than
simply declaring an aggregate figure. This will assist the remedy process and also feed
into the developments required to ensure we can calculate Transaction Service
remedies correctly.

MSU are now controlling the provision of backing data to assist in the Management
Care Visits. To provide and effective ‘pack’, this requires a good deal of effort in
extracting data from the various data bases held within the area in a tight timescale.
We are ensuring that this process is perfected and is developed into a routine task.

‘Your Guide’ MIS provision to PON is going according to plan with all our obligations
currently being satisfied. We have had positive comment from PON on the quality of
the data we are presenting and are building up a good relationship with the YG MIS
team within PON

2.2.2.2 Incident Management

We are still seeing some small volume of Receipts and Payment errors following the
regression of the final R&P fix within the SO6 release. MSU will continue to insist that
all fixes be progressed through to the live estate as quickly as possible to avoid
financial integrity issues.

APS reconciliation continues without any real problems other than PON delays in
providing TIP processed values. PON have now caught up their previous backlog in the
supply of TPS processing data to MSU and APS daily reconciliation is now up to date.

Considerable work is being completed in ensuring that a comprehensive set of
reconciliation reports and a robust incident management process is developed for the
Network Banking Stream. MSU are heavily involved in the design of both the reports
and the associated NWB ‘Workstation’ which will be used to provide support data within
the incident management process.

MSU have achieved the 100% BIMS incident management SLA target for July!

2.2.2.3 IT Support

No real issues, however we are experiencing some problems with the ordering and
provision of kit for LPD. Problems are centred on the purchase order / cost code
process. MSU are looking into ways of improving the process here through liaison with
the other areas within LPD.

2.2.2.4 Operational Services

The Operational Services Team reports no real issues. Non-polling is still a
considerable resource hungry process. MSU have pushed through changes to the
report distribution process to ensure that Tivoli has sight of the outlets that are non-
polling during the early hours of the morning when the report is produced. This should
ensure that health checking of non-polled outlets could commence earlier giving more
time to allocate engineering resource to any identified problems. Although this process
will not be needed once the full-scale outlet monitoring changes commence within the
SMC, it is a viable contingency should these new processes be unavailable at any time.

2.2.3 Strategic Services Unit

2.2.3.1 Field Service Management
By the end of June a total of 416 Site visits will have been competed by the FSM team.

The relocation at Frensham Way is planned for the Bank Holiday weekend at the end
of August. A satellite-to-satellite move is planned, and this will be the first time that such
a move has been completed. However, this date is dependent upon the new building
being completed and handed over on the 13" August, and this is still uncertain.

The SSC investigation into ‘phantom transactions’ continues to be assisted by the FSM
team. The Microtouch diagnostic equipment failed to show the presence of RF
interference at Wawne or Old Isleworth. A resistive monitor has been installed as a
diagnostic step at Old Isleworth, and initial indications are that the site is experiencing
phantom transactions on this monitor too. This eliminates the Optoma screen as a
source of the problem. User error may now be the cause, and an extended site visit to
observe working practices is planned.

The FSM team is now providing assistance in determining the current scale of the slow
running problem. 50 sites have been contacted to determine if the M1 software has
addressed their slow running symptoms. In many cases, Postmasters report no
improvement in system performance since M1. FSM visits will now be targeted, to
determine the exact nature of the concerns and provide further information to SSC/4"
line.

At the Cross Domain Problem Management meeting, Kevin Lenihan (PON) referred to
the FSM team as being “a real success story and one of the high spots of Horizon”.

Christine McKay contacted a site in Scotland regarding the complaint they had
logged with the helpdesk, only to find that their call had been wrongly
categorised. The site had called to compliment HSH, but as there was no
appropriate category, it had been marked as a complaint!

2.2.3.2 Service Management

2.2.3.2.1 Single Point of Contact (CR R106)
The CCN has been re-issued to PON and it is expected that SPoC will be introduced by

the end of August 2001. Julie Welsh will lead from ICL Pathway on its implementation
working closely with ISD HSH and the NBSC.

2.2.3.2.2 Customer Complaints

The table below shows Customer complaints received between 1% July and 27" July.
Complaints are received from 3 sources: NBSC, PM's directly and referrals from
Support sections. After investigation, the team has identified that approximately 50% of
complaints raised are not justified; all complaints are responded to and investigated.

Referrals to PON - 4 problem sites and 5 complaint calls.

To date 57 outlets have been referred to PON for retraining, all have completed either
retraining, had RNM assistance or there is a temporary problem that PON are aware of
that will be resolved soon. 30 have shown a dramatic reduction in calls to the Horizon
Helpdesk since retraining has been completed. 45 are still on monitor until calls have
reduced, or further action is required by PON.

The bulk of the complaints through this period have been driven by PONU NBSC and
have been escalated to the HSH Operations Management for investigation and report.

The complaints from NBSC have reduced by almost half this month. It would be
reasonable to conclude that this is due to HSH addressing their actions.

The HSH complaints have risen slightly; this has been largely down to the problems
with revaluation and power issues earlier in the month. Complaints regarding Agent
attitude have decreased to almost nothing. These issues are fully investigated with the
advisor concerned and their manager, and are also alerted to the Call Centre Manager
and the Operations Manager.

On the plus side: HSH have received 5 compliments this month from PM's and 4
complaints about bad advice from NBSC.

2.2.3.2.3. Compensation

We have focused our attention on the outstanding compensation claims left over from
the Implementation Team. We inherited 78 calls from A-track and the rollout helpdesk,
which has now been reduced to 21 after investigation. There are 6 claims against
Pathway still to be settled equating to approximately £2,000 in compensation.

2.2.3.2.4 Management Care Visit Programme

This month has seen the introduction of the new process involving more managers
from both PON and CS. The standard questionnaire has been supplemented by an
aide memoir, which opens up the scope of discussion with the PM. The administration
of the MCVP process has been shared between PON and the SSU on behalf of CS,
while the MSU supplies an information pack to managers immediately prior to each
visit. The document describing the new process has still to be signed of by PON.

2.2.3.2.5 HSH Call Reduction

A Counter News article was issued at the end of July to address several of the other
advice and guidance type problems by reminding postmasters what they have to hand
before contacting the helpdesk. MSU will now track the call categories to see if there is
any noticeable reduction.

2.2.3.3 Outlet Business Change

OCMS testing was suspended this month when the last of the changes that had been
input was cancelled by the Post Office. A meeting was held between the key people in
MSS, SSC, and OBC who are currently managing changes manually. No one from the
OCMS design or support was available to attend. It was agreed to feed a number of
new changes into OCMS and monitor the progress through the other systems. This had
to be aborted when the ACDB crashed and was failed over to Wigan, as OCMS cannot
currently cope with this condition. There are a few issues with the functionality of OCMS

and a further meeting is required to resolve these.

The following tables show actual deliveries for June and firm orders for changes up to

the end of November.

2.2.3.4 Implementation Tail

The installation tail rate is now running below CS expectations and as at 31° July there
are 34 outlets left to install. There appears to be a disproportionate amount of
rescheduling (particularly noticeable in Scotland) due to Postmasters withholding
approval partially due to PM holidays.

2.3 SECURITY MANAGEMENT

a. Work continues on implementing / updating anti-virus software on the live
estate. Significant configuration work has been undertaken and associated PinICLs are
being progressed or have been closed. S10 testing of software distribution has made
good progress and a successful pilot of the distribution process has been undertaken.
A revised PID has been completed to reflect the final design, which has saved 20 days
of SIDU incremental costs.

b. Work on a PID for the introduction of compliance, vulnerability and intrusion
detection toolkits is being progressed in NB timescales and is dependent upon
associated requirements.

c. Discussions on security requirements for Network Banking continue with PONU.
Emerging outputs are being consolidated in revisions to the SRS and SDS. Recent
changes to the latest version of the Requirements Catalogue will require significant
input in the area of data retrieval.

d. Input has been provided to consolidate emerging security requirements for the
GGP (YG) kiosks and contents hosting service. The rules of engagement for
penetration testing and disclosure agreements have been documented and signed off.

e. Work continues in conjunction with Consignia on defining Data Controller /
Processor responsibilities under the Data Protection Act. A DPA health check has been
arranged with ICL Group Legal to highlight any issues before the new Act fully replaces
its predecessor.

f. Four audit data extractions were completed in response to PON Security/Audit
and internal requests. Associated witness statements were provided where appropriate
on a "without prejudice" until contractual agreement is reached. Eleven requests for
information (RFls) were received this month exceeding both the agreed monthly burst
rate and the annual maximum. These will be carried over to next month.

g. The Key Manager successfully processed all key requests received this month.
The number of keys generated for key expiry replacements are now exceeding those
for roll-outs and re-rolls. The total number of outlets in the KMS key expiry exercise has
reached 750. The results are encouraging but indicate that about 10% of outlets will
ignore prompts to download new security data.

h. Work continues on an information security control grid to facilitate self-
assessment schedules for 15017790 compliance. Implementation will be progressed
across the organisation by the 1SO017799 Workshop Group as part of ISO9001
accreditation work.

3 ISSUES & RISKS

3.1 OPERATIONS & SUPPORT

3.2 INFRASTRUCTURE SERVICES
3.2.1 MSU

The BIMS SLA has been missed for several quarters due to the ongoing delays in
acquiring data for receipts and payment incidents. This is currently the subject of a
review with the SSC re the re-deployment of staff to MSU.

3.2.2 HSH Quality Award

The nomination was raised on 10" July. Almost a month on it is still unknown whether it
has been accepted or not and then presented to ISD HSH. This is too long.

3.3 SECURITY MANAGEMENT

a. The co-incidental DLT failure that resulted in an incomplete TMS audit trail
continues to be managed under normal problem management procedures. Mitigation
action for a "read after write" process and automated media management have
completed SO6 testing and will be introduced in September.

b. The KMS smoothing algorithm will be enabled by the end of August to minimise
the impact of a key expiry peak in the future. In the interim a process must be devised
for those cases where Postmasters fail to respond to related memo-view prompts.
Several outlets are already running on unchanged keys and whilst there will be no
immediate adverse effect, they will eventually be cut off from the centre and require
considerable support effort to recover. Programme priorities are likely to prevent the
early introduction of preferred automated management exception reporting via Tivoli in
favour of a manual process.

c. PON Security requirements for investigation support and the provision of
witness statements continue to place a strain on existing resource. Internal Consignia
discussions into requirements for audit related data for NWB have delayed the raising
of the expected Change Request to formalise this support.

d. Security input to Network Banking SRS/SDS and YG pilot implementation
continues to place a strain on existing resource, which is fully engaged in supporting
the existing Horizon solution. Emerging EFTPOS requirements will exacerbate the
problem.

3.4. SERVICE INTRODUCTION

3.5 FINANCE

CS Budget for OPEX 2001/02 is £56.7m

Business Model 050601 is £56.5m

Forecast (CSJune01) is £53

The major forecast changes from May actuals and forecast, are £600k forecast
reduction in HSH calls due to a lower run rate and 400k reduction due to Tip remedies
being double forecast.

The budget needs increasing for 6 security heads and reducing for Klaus and Business
Efectiveness team.

Next Stephen Muchow review is on 13" August.
