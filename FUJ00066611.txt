[25/08/00 12:07 uk079674

ted: Conacted the PM to find out what his main issue is

25/08/00 13:07 uk079674

contacted: Pm's main issue is that the performance during balancing is
Inoct fantastic.

i explained to the PM that as he has a 5 counter outlet,

the balance process will take a bit longer as it needs to

find a lot of info.

lle feels that he has not received sufficient training, and

ldmits that if he was trained properly, he may be able to

let through balancing a bit quicker.

fhe PM has requested additional training, which was

wanted, but his RNM cancelled it without letting him know, then
lenied cancelling it???

fhe PM seems to have an issue with the RNM, in that he

feels that he is not helping him resolve any issues.

the rnm has also made racist remarks and has the wrong

attitude towards him.

30/08/00 12:14 uk079674

escalate: Have escalated the PM's concerns about his RNM to Julie
jelsh to flag a complaint through POCL.

It have explained to the PM that as there is nothing wrong

ith his sytem (software wise) we are unable to help him.

though i will get SMC to double check his free space.

Ir have suggested that to speed up his system he would be

better off going onto individual stock units, as this would

cut down the process time for a balance.

30/08/00 12:19 uk079674

follow Up: Spoke to Andy Abernethy re looking at his free space.

lhe is talking about or whether it is the whole site that he

says is slow. Shelley has said possibly counter 5 and

lateway slow, but thinks he may be talking about the whole site.

lr) Response

lust to comfirm that this is the standrd issue of using many counters with a
shared stock unit, I have looked at the messagestore and calculated the
number of transactions processed for the trial balance, and it comes to
lapprox 25 a second. The range we tend to see are 20 - 25 a second so his are
actually quite quick!

I have spoken to Julie regarding this call, and suggested that we check how
the difference between individual and shared stock units are explained to the
lpMs. The maximum number of counters on a shared stock unit before the PMs
complain seems to be 3 (if not too busy!) but we have seen larger offices
recently (4 or in this case 5!) which process no slower than other offices,
lexcept they have more transactions. This is not a software fault. To

shorten the time the PM has to stay out of hours he will have to go to
individual stock units
