   role          G RO         I was approached to replace him and after some

   persuasion assumed the role in April 1997.

5. This role involved co-ordinating all the projects and business as usual

   activities necessary to deliver the business benefits of automating the

   counter.

   This involved identifying the touch points between activities, managing

   interdependencies and points of friction with activities outside the

   Programme, maintaining and supporting governance structures, maintaining

   a programme plan incorporating the dependencies and touch points,

   managing programme issues and risks and providing assurance of project

   activities.

6. What this role did not involve was the line management of projects. My

   authority over the projects was derived through the Automation

   Transformation Steering Group whose membership was made up of the

   Directors of the business (some of whom were project sponsors)

   supplemented by the Group CIO, business Head of IS              Paul Thornton of
                                                             and




   French Thornton.

7. On the creation of Post Office Network I became Automation Director

   assuming line management of Horizon and all other IT based projects that

   fell within the business unit control. I retained Programme Management.

   This meant I had direct control of Horizon through the final throes of

   acceptance, the roll out and the delivery of Core System Release plus (the

   system was delivered in two phases). The               phase was delivered to
                                                 second

38. The June 1998 ATSG minutes are not particularly helpful on the EPOSS

   issue, there is a heading but no description, but by looking at the minutes of

   subsequent meetings I believe the issue is that concerning the £3.1 m of TP

   errors. I have absolutely no recollection of this item but there is sufficient

   information in meeting minutes to give a broad idea of this issue.

39.There was a network of around 10,000 terminals used for certain payments

   for utilities. The data centre for these terminals was based at the Group IT

   facility in Farnborough. This network was to be retired but this was dependant

41 I was asl eul tu describe the nature of the work I carried out in relation to

   EPOSS design. I must reiterate that I did not manage Horizon and it was

   normally for the Horizon management team to manage the project issues and

   risks. I did, however, step in on this issue. I commissioned a French Thornton

   consultant, Darren Bosco, to see what if any information he could glean from

   Pathway about EPOSS design. Against expectation Pathway allowed him

   inside the "Black Box"         24 hours. Darren presented his findings to the




                            for
   ATSG. Addressing a largely non-technical forum he would have simplified his

   presentation so that it was accessible.

42.1 do have some recollection of this presentation, but by no means all of it.

   Darren had expected to find a modular design. In such a design, new

   transactions could be added without impacting existing transactions.

   Interfaces would be established with some other modules e.g. a cash

   accounting module. There would be exchanges of data but the software would

   not be linked.

43.What he discovered was that all transactions would be rooted in a core

   horizon. The implication was that when a new transaction was added it would,

   through this core, be linked to other transactions and it could impact i.e,

   introduce error, into pre-existing transactions. A consequence of this was that

   extensive regression testing would be necessary every time       a




                                                                        new transaction

   was added to ensure that the legacy had not been corrupted. This distorted

   the normal relationship between time in development and time in testing.

44. He did observe that the solution enabled rapid development of new

   transactions. A transaction could be developed in days rather than weeks and

   months.

45.As far as moving away from this design was concerned, he reported this could

   not be achieved by tinkering around the edges (my words!) something

   different would require starting over again.

          proving r{cesses and procedures than was required. This risk materialised.

         At the time there would have been a log of errors and the Horizon project will

         have tracked rectification activity. A further 4 week testing window was driven

         into the plan to ensure that all planned testing could be completed. The issue

         of integrity of files passed from Pathway to POCL remained an issue and a

         new dimension surfaced late during the acceptance process and was deemed

         category A (i.e. grounds for not accepting). This was about the lack of integrity

         controls within Pathway. The rectification plan for this was closely monitored

 training, integrity control, screen freezes/lock ups and the Horizon System

 Helpdesk. Under the terms of the contract Pathway were paid nothing for

 the development of Horizon until contractual acceptance had been

 achieved. Both parties anticipated that the calling of any fault as category A

 was likely to be contested. Whilst there was a contractual process for

 dealing with disputes ultimately leading to arbitration this was seen by both

 parties as taking longer than was desirable so it was agreed to inject Peter

 Copping of PA Consulting into the process.

   and if the                                   -'c the slightest doubt about the checks she would have

   given it very high profile. There are no such doubts expressed in any of the

   meeting material I was asked to consider. For the reason explained in

   paragraph 60 I can't comment on help desk.

62. i was asked what I understood the integrity control proposal to entail. I

   cannot recall this in any sort of detail. A very simple example of this would

   be if data was transferred from A to B and the data consisted of x records

   totalling the value y at the end of the transfer B should have received x

   records value total y. Integrity checks should run through an accounting

   system like Blackpool through a stick of rock. They did not.

=5. Finally, I was asked what action did I take to report concerns within or

  outside POCL. Horizon was sponsored out of PON. Throughout this vital

  period Horizon featured at PON Executive management meetings. There

  was also a Programme Board attended by all PON Directors. I had frequent

  conversations with senior colleagues about progress. Communication

  outside the business was undertaken by Dave Miller, PON Managing

  Director, who led the high level Acceptance meetings with Pathway. Several

  documents witness this communication.

GENERAL


71.1 was asked looking back if I consider PON effectively scrutiriisca the t:sting

   tri l a d acceptance of the Hh id1zora systc m. p believe, what wo did to he

      cctive. However, lbelieve thore arc much better wayc of conducting this

    .vcrutiray than te way it ha, 'pcuod for CS . if no ways of working adopted

   from 50 onwards through to Sib had been adopted for Core System

   Release l       cvo that the journey through to roll Oul of Horizon Would

   been c oothcr ai d the , oc mss of scrutiny easier. That involved Fujitsu

   inveivernn :rit in roan im cuts nriplysi; , C 1~,..n'ving full visihility of the

   intended design. a joint approach to testing and a rather more or„ laaoaative

     p roach to prohiem solving.

72. 1 was asked whether I consider that the t$aorl on syster 1 was fit for purpose

   at tha point at which it was rolled out. Given the rigorous process around

   rreasf.. r ar agen-lent and, acceptance I had no reason to believe that

   Horizon was anything ai,.it fit for purpose at the time of rof out I lore i in a

   raast. 1 would it have regarded ,it for pug-pose meaning that me system

   wou:d not 1n operation prove to have hugs that wouid require fixing. All the

   systems I've experienced are in a constant state of bug fixing. Testing and

   the other seeds into Acceptance % ihi have demonstrated the business

   processes could continue as designed.
