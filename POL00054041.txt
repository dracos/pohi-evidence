Following my statement of 6” January 2009, I would now like to add the following.

I have been a Post Office® Investigator for almost 10 years, having joined the department in
June 2000.

Over the years I have developed a working knowledge of Horizon and have successfully
undertaken a variety of casework involving different fraud transactions. However, my
knowledge of the Horizon system is not up to the level of a counter clerk or subpostmaster
who uses the system on an almost daily basis. I also have no IT knowledge as to the workings

of the Horizon equipment or data transfer.

I have used the Horizon system when requested, to work at main Post Offices during strike
periods and at Christmas to assist with the seasonal increase in customers. I have had minimal
training on the/use of Horizon but have always been able to conduct most customer
transactions wp

balance the stock that I have been using. I have never experienced any

problems with the Horizon system other than pressing the wrong icon on the screen and

requiring assistance from a more experienced clerk to get me back to the correct screen.

As an Investigator {I have been tasked with investigating cases such as, Audit Shortages, Pension
& Allowance Fraud, Driving Licence Application Fraud, Postage Fraud, Green Giro Fraud, Post
Office® Card Account Fraud, Banking Fraud, Bureau Fraud e.g. Due to the wide variety of
cases that we investigate it is not always possible to remember how the transaction is carried
out on Horizon and therefore, I would seek advice from any number of sources within Post
Office® Ltd such as colleagues, Branch Managers, Auditors, Contract Managers, Operations
Manuals etc. to fully understand the fraud and how it is being carried out. Liaison with
external agencies such as Alliance & Leicester, DVLA and First Rate e.t.c is also made to assist

with enquiries where necessary

When conducting enquiries at a Post Office®, if any interview with a member of staff reveals a
system problem as a possible cause for the loss then this would be followed up as a matter of
course by making the necessary enquiries with our Financial Department at Chesterfield in the
first instance. If during interview no mention is made of system failures and other reasons are
given for cause of the losses such as staff thefts then I would not as an Investigator make

system enquiries.

that have already been copied and forwarded to Post Office® Legal Services, the remainder of
the file contains information relating to Mrs Misra’s application to become a subpostmaster,
