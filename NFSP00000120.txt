Dear Executive Officer,
COUNTER AUTOMATION - BA/POCL

Further to the meeting at Pathway on 23rd July 1996 you will recall that we were keen
to establish the Federation as a partner with Pathway and part of the formal
development of the automation platform and its introduction into the network.

lam sure you will be pleased with the attached letter which sets in train the first stages
of that formal relationship. We will report further developments in due course at which
time we hope to have a clearer understanding of the possible involvement of Executive
Officers and, indeed, Branch Secretaries.

You will also be interested to know that I have had a meeting with the company who
are going to be training Sub-Postmasters. We have agreed to continue that
relationship as training will be very important as it becomes linked to the roll out
programme.

Your:

COLIN BAKER
General Secretary

Dear Colin '

BA/POCL AUTOMATION - NFSP FUTURE INVOLVEMENT I

1. Tenjoyed our meeting, with colleagues, yesterday (3 September).
thought we made good progress on how the NESP could keep abreast of,
and add value to, the development of the programune, which we all
acknowledge as vital to the long-term health of the businesy. I said I'd
confirm our discussions.

2. First, on more strategic issues, I will keep you in touch, ona personal \
basis, with overall progress, including an understanding of any critical i
political and commercial dimensions, We will do this ona bi-monthly I
basis, with Alex Docherty chairing and arranging these briefings and you I
in your General Secretary capacity. Alex will be in touch with dates. i

3. Secondly, operationally Bruce McNiven, from the Prograrnme Delivery
Authority, will be in touch separately to notify you of a structural
frarnework we intend for subpostmasters to be involved in both user
acceptance testing, and in generating possible solutions to operational I
problems that might arise. You and Bruce willl discuss the NFSP’s part in
that to help smooth implementation.

4. Third, as regards planning communication, We agreed that an integrated
approach is important to ensure all offices understand the need for good
co-operation in rolling out this change programme, Again, Bruce will be

in touch so that liaison can take place between the PDA’s communication
team and your own agents on both internal and external communication. I

5. Finally, we all agreed that what we are intending to cover is entirely

separate from any contractual discussions that arise between the NESP I
and POCL, which would take place through Alex Docherty and his team.

Yours sincerely
