Subject: Thank you - SS/JFSA/JA coverage

There is virtually no coverage as far as I can see this am. Precise reported little. James was on News at
Ten last evening, which although he left open the possibility of unsafe convictions, his interview was
balanced-ish, the BBC voice-over said clearly this did not mean Spmrs were in the right and Po in the
wrong, and more work was needed.

It_ would be good to get a transcript of that interview for our records. I thought it might be on BBC
iPlayer or James' website - but not so far.

We will catch up later on next steps as Alwen and I will need to be clear for the Board tonight and we
may be asked for a Board paper for next week. And as we have already said, there will need to be a
thorough lessons learnt as well as a way forward.

But the real reason for sending this note is to thank everyone for your work. It has been an
extraordinary few days, which none of us has any desire to repeat in a hurry. But we worked well, under
huge pressure and showed yet again what makes PO such a strong business. I don’t wish to single out
anyone as we all played our part. I am very grateful.

I would however, like to thank by name some of your teams who have supported us and without whom we would
not reached even this far - most recently the comms team - Ruth and Nina, who have worked very, very
effectively to produce nothing :) fantastic! And Richard for the internal briefings.

I'm also grateful to Hugh and Rodric and to Angela and Simon, who have responded to our urgent requests
for help and information with intelligence and professionalism. We have been guided well by them. (If I
have missed anyone, my apologies and please forward this note.)

More to come clearly... but for now... Well done and thank you.
