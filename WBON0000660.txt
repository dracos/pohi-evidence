Tom,

I’ve spoken with Mark and he would in principle be happy to assist going forward.

Mark has several smaller hearings in the run up to a 6-7 week arbitration commencing the last week of May
so he has good availability over the coming months to advise and draft as required.

As things stand, Mark would then be looking from January 2020 to accommodate a hearing in the Court of
Appeal.

T hope that this assists and look forward to hearing from you in due course.

All the best,
Luke

Sorry for the delay but I haven’t yet had an opportunity to speak to Mark.

Today is the last day of an Arbitration that he is attending so I’ll speak to him when he returns this evening.

All the best,

Luke

Look forward to hearing.
