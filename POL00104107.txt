I would appreciate seeing a redraft of the minutes to include the points raised by Tom

I must say at this stage I do not feel comfortable that the minutes truly reflect the complete unawareness of the
Board to the existence of a Deloitte report, whom it was commissioned by, and the contents therein, and that the
minutes reflect the complete shock at finding out that Fujitsu had remote access. If my memory is correct we
heard this just prior to the Horizon judgement. Again we resolved to find out whom knew about this access and
why it was not made aware to the Board.

Thank you in anticipation of your kind consideration of the above points for the drafting of the minutes

Best regards

Ken

I’ve got a few points on the minutes from the last meeting.

In the matters resolved in para 7 it mentions a route map of decisions leading to the GLO and makes specific
reference to who knew about the Deloitte report.

I'd like to clarify that the “who knew about” question should apply to the various pieces of work commissioned:
- following POL’s response to the 2nd Second Sight report

- following termination of the Mediation Scheme

- following the Jonathan Swift QC report

Although not discussed explicitly last week, I hope we can agree also to look at whether recommended actions
(eg by the QCs) were not completed or only partially completed. A good example is the Deloitte report which as
I understand it only addressed the Horizon system since 2010 notwithstanding the QC’s recommendation to

look at remote access over the life of the Horizon system.

I think we also asked Tim to report back on what his recollection is as to what discussions too place with
management - presumably Paula and Jane - regarding which of these matters should be discussed at the Board.
