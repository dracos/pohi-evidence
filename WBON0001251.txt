Post Office Group Litigation - SUBJECT TO LEGAL PRIVILEGE - DO NOT FORWARD
Elizabeth, Helen,

Further to our recent exchanges, please find attached:

The Information Sharing Protocol, which incorporates all of UKGI’s last round of changes, with no further
amendment from Post Office save for the administrative points of:

a. adding the parties’ names to the document’s title;

b. inserting today’s date at the end of the Protocol on page 3;

bed

updating Appendix A to reflect the timetable as at today’s date; and

d. correcting the cross-reference in Clause 1.12 of Appendix B from “Clause 1.7(b)” to “Clause
1.11.2”.

Please now treat this as agreed.

With respect to the timetable, we are still finalising the Order to be made following the 5 June 2018
C&CMC, which may influence some of the Horizon Trial dates. We will let you know if this results in any
significant change to the timetable in accordance with para.7 of the Protocol.
