Subject: Freedom of information request 12/1362: proposed Section

ee 36 exemption regarding Ministerial briefing
Purpose:

1. To seek your agreement as a qualified person to withhold certain information
requested under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). A Ministerial decision is
required to determine whether the exemption in section 36 (prejudice to the effective
conduct of Government affairs) should be relied on.

Recommendation:
2. That you:

a. agree that section 36 should be relied on, and that Ministerial meeting
briefing papers, and certain exchanges between the Department and Post
Office Ltd should not be released, signalling your consent by signing
paragraph 21 (for internal audit purposes);

b. note that other exemptions will also be applied; and

Cc. note the proposed release of documents not covered by any exemption.
Timing:
3. Ideally early in week commencing 29 October. The statutory deadline for response

was 22 October but the information requestor has been notified that more time is
needed to consider the public interest test.

Summary:

4. The request covers the Department's engagement with Post Office Ltd with regards to
concerns and criticism from a number of former subpostmasters who believe Post
Office Ltd’s accounting system (Horizon) is responsible for their contracts being
terminated by Post Office Ltd. The Department has always supported Post Office
Ltd’s assertion that the system is robust.

5. In June, the company, with agreement from the Department, appointed an external
forensic accountancy firm to conduct an independent review of a selection of cases
where former subpostmasters believed the system was at fault. This review has been
championed by James Arbuthnot MP on behalf of a former subpostmaster in his
constituency. Post Office Ltd is confident that the independent review will support
their view that the system is robust and fit for purpose. However, the review has
sparked some interest, including this Fol.

6. The Department holds information within scope of the Fol request, including
Ministerial briefing submissions and email correspondence with Post Office Ltd. We
intend to release the majority of information held, but recommend withholding some
under various exemptions of the Fol Act, including section 36 (prejudice to the
effective conduct of Government affairs). Section 36 is the only FOI Act exemption

PROTECT

which requires a Minister to be satisfied that release would, or would be likely to,
inhibit (in this case) the free and frank provision of advice.

Application of exemptions
7. The Department has received the following Fol request from a journalist:
“Il would like to be provided with:

1) Copies of any and all correspondence between BIS Ministers, their special
advisors or BIS employees and the Post Office/Royal Mail pertaining to the
integrity and performance of the Horizon or Horizon OnLine systems. Please
limit your search to information dating from May 2010 to the present.

2) Copies of any all minutes or records of meetings between BIS Ministers, their
special advisors, BIS employees and the Post Office/Royal Mail, where any
part of those records relates to the integrity or performance of the Horizon or
Horizon OnLine systems. Please limit your search to information dating from
May 2010 to the present.

3) Copies of any and all internal memos or briefing documents complied by BIS
Ministers, their special advisors, BIS employees or by external organisations
for BIS, where any part of those documents relates to the integrity or
performance of the Horizon or Horizon OnLine systems. Please limit your
search to information dating from May 2010 to the present.”

8. The Department holds 38 items of information which fall within scope of this request.
The majority relate to Ministerial correspondence cases relating to the Horizon
accounting system, enquiries to the company regarding press interest in the story, the
preparation of reactive press office lines, and briefing for Ministers meeting
representatives of former subpostmasters. We do not hold any notes or formal
meeting minutes.

9. We propose to release 28 items of information, and are proposing to withhold 10
items. Of these items, we recommend that you consider whether the exemption in
section 36 should be relied upon in seven cases. Details of all documents within
scope of the request are provided at Annex A, and copies of the documents we
believe should be exempted under section 36 are attached at Annex B.

10.We consider the information we propose to withhold is exempt under:

= Section 36(2)(b) - disclosure would, or would be likely to, inhibit the free and
frank provision of advice.

11.In addition, the following exemptions variously apply to other documents or part of
them:

= Section 40(2) - it contains personal data.
= Section 41 - the information concerned was provided in confidence.
= Section 42 — the information attracts legal professional privilege.

= Section 43(2) — disclosure would be likely to prejudice the commercial interests
of Post Office Ltd.

12. Sections 36(2)(b); 42; and 43(2) are qualified exemptions, meaning that their
application is subject to a test of the public interest balance in each case. Section
40(2) and 41 are absolute exemptions and are not subject to a public interest test.

13. The reasons for the application of these exemptions are set out in our draft letter to
the respondent (attached for information at Annex C).

Section 36 (prejudice to effective conduct of public affairs

14. The decision to rely on section 36 can only be taken by a qualified person who
decides whether release would, or would be likely to, inhibit (in this case) the free and
frank provision of advice.

15.In Government Departments, Ministers are the qualified persons. We therefore
require you to decide whether section 36 should be engaged in this instance.

16.We consider that the release of Departmental briefing for Ministerial meetings about
the Horizon system, and certain email exchanges with Post Office Ltd regarding the
exchange of information about the Horizon system would prejudice the effective
conduct of public affairs both in this matter but also more generally. We consider that
disclosure of this information may alter the nature and substance of future advice
given by Post Office Ltd if they feel that candid advice provided about the Horizon
system for the purposes of briefing Ministers or developing strategy more broadly may
in future be publicly disclosed. Our oversight of Post Office Ltd as shareholder relies
on us being able to get access to information from that company. If the company felt
that information they provided to us might be disclosed, we are concerned that they
may be more reluctant to offer views or input as part of the deliberative process. This
would clearly have a detrimental impact on the effective conduct of public affairs
because our ability to provide advice to Minsters would be inhibited.

17.For these reasons, officials believe that disclosure would result in prejudice to the
nature of information and advice provided by Post Office Ltd, which would significantly
impact on the quality of advice provided to Ministers by officials.

18.Should you decide that section 36 should be relied on, we request that you signal
your consent by signing the wording set out at paragraph 21 (overleaf). This will
ensure a full audit trail in the event that the case is referred to the Information
Commissioner.

following request for information:

“I would like to be provided with:

integrity and performance of the Horizon or Horizon OnLine systems. Please
limit your search to information dating from May 2010 to the present.

5) Copies of any all minutes or records of meetings between BIS Ministers, their
special advisors, BIS employees and the Post Office/Royal Mail, where any
part of those records relates to the integrity or performance of the Horizon or
Horizon OnLine systems. Please limit your search to information dating from

Having reviewed the information held by the Department which falls within the scope of
this request, I consider that the some of the information requested should be exempt
from disclosure under section 36(2)(b) of the Freedom of Information Act 2000.

ANNEX C - DRAFT LETTER TO CORRESPONDENT

BIS Ref No: 12/1362

October 2012
Dear David Pegg,

Thank you for your email of 17 September 2012 where you requested information under
the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). You have asked for the following:

“I would like to be provided with:

7) Copies of any and all correspondence between BIS Ministers, their special
advisors or BIS employees and the Post Office/Royal Mail pertaining to the
integrity and performance of the Horizon or Horizon OnLine systems. Please
limit your search to information dating from May 2010 to the present.

8) Copies of any all minutes or records of meetings between BIS Ministers, their
special advisors, BIS employees and the Post Office/Royal Mail, where any
part of those records relates to the integrity or performance of the Horizon or
Horizon OnLine systems. Please limit your search to information dating from
May 2010 to the present.

9) Copies of any and all internal memos or briefing documents complied by BIS
Ministers, their special advisors, BIS employees or by external organisations
for BIS, where any part of those documents relates to the integrity or
performance of the Horizon or Horizon OnLine systems. Please limit your
search to information dating from May 2010 to the present.”

We have now completed the search of the records for the information we hold relating to
your requests.

A copy of the information, which can be disclosed, is attached. Details of this information
are provided at Annex A.

The remainder of the information that you requested is exempt under section 36(2)(b), in
that it would, or would be likely to, inhibit the free and frank provision of advice; section
40(2), in that it relates to personal data; section 41, in that the information concerned
was provided in confidence; section 42, in that the information attracts legal professional
privilege; and section 43(2), in that disclosure would be likely to prejudice the
commercial interests of Post Office Ltd.

Sections 36(2)(b), 42, and 43(2) are qualified exemptions, meaning that their application
is subject to a test of the public interest balance in each case. Section 40(2) and 41 are
absolute exemptions and not subject to a public interest test.

PROTECT

Section 36(2)(b)

Section 36(2)(b) exempts information if it would, or would be likely to, inhibit the free and
frank provision of advice. There is a public interest in favour of disclosure of this
information in order to provide greater transparency around the subjects discussed in the
context of the meetings, correspondence and other documentation in question.

However, we consider that it is necessary that officials are able to provide advice to
Ministers about the operation of the Horizon system without feeling inhibited by the
possibility of its future disclosure. It is vital that Ministers have access to this advice to
support them in carrying out their duties. Disclosure of such information may alter the
nature and substance of future advice given by Post Office Ltd or other parties. They
may be more reluctant to offer views or input as part of the deliberative process. This
would clearly have a detrimental impact on the effective conduct of public affairs which
would not be in the public interest.

The application of section 36(2)(b) requires a determination by a qualified person. In
response to your request for information, the qualified person (the Minister for
Employment Relations and Consumer Affairs) is of the view that the balance of public
interest lies in withholding.

Section 40(2)

The information we hold contains some personal information which we are withholding in
accordance with section 40(2). Section 40(2) provides an absolute exemption for
personal data which then falls to be dealt with under the Data Protection Act. Personal
data of third parties can only be disclosed in accordance with the data protection
principles. In particular, the first data protection principle requires that disclosure must be
fair and lawful and must comply with one of the conditions in Schedule 2 of the Data
Protection Act.

We do not think that it is fair to release the names of junior members of Departmental
and Post Office Ltd staff, or constituents and information that could be used to identify
them, and do not think that any of the relevant conditions apply. We also consider that
there was a legitimate expectation by these individuals that this information would remain
confidential.

Section 41

Section 41 of the Act is an absolute exemption and applies to information that we have
obtained from any other person, and where disclosing it would constitute an actionable
breach of confidence by that or any other person. Some information covered by your
request was provided to Departmental officials in the strictest confidence. It covers
matters that are highly commercially sensitive, and are confidential. As a duty of
confidence exists, there is a strong public interest in protecting that confidence and there
are no public interest considerations in relation to this information requiring us to set the
duty of confidentiality aside. The Department's decision is therefore to withhold the
release of some of the requested information.

PROTECT

Section 42

It is essential to ensure that ministers and officials can take full and frank legal advice.
We consider the possibility of disclosing legal advice risks full and frank advice being
given in the future, which would be contrary to the public interest. For this reason, when
considering the balance of public interest in disclosure of the information covered by
section 42, as against the public interest in maintaining that exemption and withholding
the information, it is our view that it is not in the public interest for such privileged
information to be released.

Section 43

Given the important social and economic role that Post Office Ltd plays in communities
across the country, the Department does accept that there is a general public interest in
the disclosure of information in relation to Post Office Ltd.

However, some of the information which your request covers is commercially sensitive
and we consider that disclosure of this information would make it less likely that Post
Office Ltd would, in the future, provide the Department with similar information,
undermining our ability to provide the best outcome for Post Office Ltd, its agents, and
the UK taxpayer. Furthermore, disclosure would, or would be likely to, prejudice the
commercial interests of Post Office Ltd, particularly as its network operates within a
highly competitive sector.

If you are unhappy with the result of your request for information, you may request an
internal review within two calendar months of the date of this letter. If you wish to request
an internal review, please contact the Information Rights Unit:

Please remember to use the reference 12/1362 in any future communications relating to
your request.

If you are not content with the outcome of the internal review, you have the right to apply
directly to the Information Commissioner for a decision. The Information Commissioner
