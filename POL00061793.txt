NO TRANSACTION DATE AND TIME WAS PROVIDED FOR THIS ACTION USING CURRENT DATE AND
TIME Update by Anne Chambers:Category 94 -- Final -- Advice and guidance given:I have checked very carefully
land can see no indication that the continuing discrepancies are due to a system problem. I have not been able to
‘pin down discrepancies to individual days or stock units because the branch does not seem to be operating ina
particularly organised manner. In particular I have noted 1. There are 6 stock units for this 3 counter branch,
which seems a bit excessive. 2. The loss in euros in TP 9 appears genuine - the declared quantity was 4000
fewer than the system expected. Itis not clear from the information above whether anyone found out why this,
happened (there were several rem outs, and a rem in, on 23rd Dec - did the pouches contain the declared
number of euros?). 3. Stock is sometimes transferred out of a stock unit where it is not held. In particular there
were several transfers out of stock unit SMI in TP 10. At the end of the period the stock figures were corrected
‘back up to zero via Adjust Stock. This gave a gain of over £2000 in SMI. Equivalent negative stock adjusts in AA
(gave a corresponding loss in AA. 4. I am not confident that the stock declarations are always correct e.g. at the

lend of TP 9 there was a declared holding of 5 £20 PO phonecards in the branch, t hen a few days later 20 were
transferred from one SU to another. None were remmed in until a week after that. 5. The branch had declared 27
£20 Argos vouchers at the end of TP-9. Branches have now been instructed to rem out this product; they remmed
‘out 17 and adjusted stock to account for the remaining 10 (so did they really only have 17 to start with?). This has
‘correctly caused a loss of £200 in SU AA. 6. Lottery instants sales are entered onto the system as a single
‘transaction every 10 days or so. 7. Stock units SMI and AA rolled over with non -zero cheque holding. This may
‘be to do with how the discrepancies have been accounted for but I do not really understand this (the total is
‘(greater than the sum of the branch adjustments for TP 9 and 10). I recomm end that this call is passed back to
'NBSC tier 2 for further investigation, since there is no evidence that the discrepancies are being caused by a
