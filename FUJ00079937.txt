1.0 Process Introduction

The following terms are defined to assist understanding of this process:
e An Incident is defined as:

“Any event that is not part of the Standard Operation of a Service and that causes,
or may cause, an interruption to, or a reduction in, the quality of that Service’

e A Problem is defined as the underlying root cause of one or more Incidents.

e A Known Error is an Incident or a Problem for which the root cause has
been diagnosed and a work round or cure has been identified.

¢ A Trend is an identifiable pattern or tendency.

¢ A Permanent Fix is a solution to an issue which has resolved the root cause
so the issue will not re-occur

e A Work-around is a solution to an issue which has restored service but has
not resolved the root cause so the issue may re-occur.

e A Fault is an event that has led to loss of service or has increased the
possibility of loss of service
1.1 Principles of Incident Management

The Incident Management Process should ensure that all reported incidents are recorded and
dealt with in a consistent and structured manner.

Problem Management is focused on finding the solution, whereas Incident
Management is focused on restoring the service.

2.0 Incident Management Process

2.1. Functional Overview

The purpose of this process is to ensure that:

All reported faults are recorded as Incident Records.

Incident Records are allocated a unique identifier to allow individual
referencing.

Incident Records contain the following information: timestamp when the
fault occurred or was logged, originator, recording user identifier, status,
priority, escalation history, incident category, fault description, fault
resolution.

The Incident has a clearly identifiable owner. This allows the user reporting
the incident to have a single point of contact and gives the owner of the
incident the responsibility for ensuring it is dealt with through the complete
lifecycle of the incident.

Incidents Records are automatically escalated or re-assigned if they meet
determined criteria.

Faults requiring a fix solution to be developed or remaining unresolved are
escalated to Problem status.

Incident Records are analysed and correlated to determine failure patterns and
predict common failures in other resources.

2.2 Process Benefits

This process provides the following benefits:

2.3 Scope

reduced business impact of Incidents by timely resolution, thereby increasing
effectiveness

improved monitoring, allowing performance against SLAs to be accurately
measured

improved management information on aspects of service quality provided by a
centralised source.

better staff utilisation, leading to greater efficiency
elimination of lost or incorrect Incidents and service requests
Contribute towards ISO and ITIL compliance

improved User and Customer satisfaction.

Improved image/reputation of Fujitsu Post Office Account.

The scope of this process includes all elements that make up the controlled (live)
environment

It does not include development environments.

2.4 Owner
PAMs (To be confirmed)

2.5 Process Description

2.5.1 Fault Receipt and Logging
A fault may be reported via several channels:
e Event monitoring (manual or automated).
e A Post Master may identify a fault situation has occurred.
e A 3" Line Service Delivery Unit (SDU) may discover a fault
e Another Post Office Account (POA) representative may discover a fault
e A Change implementation may fail.

Typically, the fault will be reported via a telephone call to the HSH or an abnormal event
discovered by SMC.

2.5.2 Classification and Prioritisation

An initial review by HSH or SMC will determine how the Incident record should be classified
and what priority should be assigned to the resolution of the fault. In addition, the HSH / SMC
will determine if other similar Incidents have been reported or if an existing Problem record
exists. In this case, the Incident records will be linked to ensure satisfactory resolution of all
associated faults.

2.5.3 Investigation and Diagnosis

HSH and SMC will determine whether they are able to resolve the Incident and will make use
of problem determination scripts and Knowledge databases as appropriate. Incidents which
cannot be resolved by HSH / SMC will be re-assigned to the appropriate 3" Line SDU for
further investigation. If a fault is deemed to require escalation the POA Problem & Availability
Manager (PAM) will be contacted.

If the 3" Line SDU determines that they are unable to resolve the Incident or a Service Level
Agreement escalation point has been reached the POA PAM will be informed. If agreement
has been reached that the Incident is now a Problem, the PAM will raise a call on the PMDB
as in accordance with 2.4.2 of the Problem Management Process CS/PRD/021. The PAM or a
recognised Service Manager will be allocated to manage the Problem.

Procedure Date: 20-JAN-2005

2.5.4 Escalation

In the event of an incident being escalated the POA PAM will, in discussion with PO Ltd,
determine if the incident is major and requires active management. If it does the PAM will be
the central point for communication to POA management and PO Ltd and will have
responsibility for restoring service as quickly as possible.

2.5.5 Resolution

An identified resolution (permanent fix or work-around) will be implemented, potentially via
the Change Management (work-around) or Release Management (permanent fix) processes.
Successful implementation of the solution must be verified with the fault reporter in order to
ensure that all reported symptoms have been resolved.

2.5.6 Closure

Following verification with the fault reporter, the Incident record should be closed. The HSH /
SMC will determine a Closure Code, identify potential learning points identify if the incident
could re-occur, determine if the incident was due to an underlying problem and if so, raise an
associated Problem Record or link to a current Problem Record. The HSH/SMS would then
change the incident status to closed.
