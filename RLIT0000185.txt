Introduction

1.

Between March 2015 and March 2020, the CCRC received applications
from 61 individuals who were formerly sub-postmasters (“SPMs’), or
managers or counter assistants in Post Office branches, who had been
convicted of or who had pleaded guilty to theft, fraud or false accounting
of which the Post Office was the victim. Where they are mentioned in this
Statement of Reasons they are referred to as the “Post Office
applicants’.

The Post Office applicants submitted that there was new evidence
concerning (i) failings in the Post Office’s Horizon computer system and
(ii) the response of Post Office Ltd (“POL”) to those failings which was
relevant to the safety of their convictions. They said that there were
underlying faults in the Horizon system which caused it to overstate the
amount of cash or stock which should be on the premises of a particular
branch, thereby causing unexplained shortfalls in branch accounts, and
that this in turn led to their convictions. They also submitted that Fujitsu,
the company which developed and operated the Horizon system for the
Post Office, had undisclosed information about errors caused by the
system.

Separately, approximately 580 former SPMs, Crown Office employees,
managers and counter assistants brought civil claims for damages
against POL relating to the alleged deficiencies in the Horizon system. In
March 2017, the High Court made a Group Litigation Order for the
management of these claims. 62 of the civil claimants had criminal
convictions in connection with shortfalls at the Post Office branches at
which they formerly worked; and 53 of those individuals are also
applicants to the CCRC. The High Court proceedings led eventually to
the “Common Issues” judgment’ in March 2019 and the “Horizon Issues”
judgment’, delivered on 16 December 2019. Shortly before the Horizon
Issues judgment was handed down, the claimants and POL reached a
settlement which brought to an end the civil proceedings.

On 3 June 2020 the CCRC formally referred the convictions of 34 Post
Office applicants to the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division), on the
following ground:

“In view of the findings of the High Court in Alan Bates & Ors v Post
Office Ltd (Judgment No 3) “Common Issues” [2019] EWHC 606 (QB)
and Alan Bates & Ors v Post Office Ltd (Judgment No 6) “Horizon
Issues” [2019] EWHC 3408 (QB), there is a real possibility that the
Court of Appeal will conclude that it was an abuse of process to
prosecute these cases, and will conclude that the associated

' Alan Bates & Ors v Post Office Ltd (Judgment (No 3) “Common Issues” [2019] EWHC 606 (QB).
? Alan Bates & Ors v Post Office Ltd (Judgment (No 6) “Horizon Issues” [2019] EWHC 3408 (QB).

convictions are thereby unsafe.” [Paragraph 192 of CCRC Statement of
Reasons, 03/06/2020]

5. The CCRC’s detailed reasons for that decision are set out in its
“Statement of Reasons for a Reference to the Court of Appeal’, dated 3
June 2020 (hereafter “the referral SoR”). A detailed summary of the
background to the Post Office cases appears at paragraphs 9-25 of the
document, while paragraphs 5-8 summarise the CCRC’s main reasons
for the referral decision.

6. When the CCRC formally referred the convictions of 34 Post Office
applicants to the Court of Appeal on 3 June 2020, the CCRC also
announced that it had decided to refer the convictions of seven further
Post Office applicants to the Court of Appeal. Those seven cases were
formally referred to the Court of Appeal on 29 July 2020, and a Statement
of Reasons relating to those cases was supplied to the Court of Appeal
on that date. A further referral was sent to the Court of Appeal on 25
November 2020.

7. When deciding to refer the 34 Crown Court convictions to the Court of
Appeal, the CCRC also decided to refer for appeal on the same basis the
convictions of a number of Post Office applicants who pleaded guilty or
who were convicted in Magistrates’ Courts.

8. Since 29 July 2020 the CCRC has continued work reviewing the cases of
other Post Office applicants, including Mrs. Adedayo. Mrs. Adedayo’s
case is now addressed in this Statement of Reasons.

Mrs. Adedayo’s Conviction

This section summarises the case as presented in the original proceedings. It
does not necessarily reflect the CCRC's view of that evidence or of those
arguments or indeed the applicant's assessment of the evidence or arguments
as presented to the CCRC.

1.

2.

10.

Mrs. Adedayo was the SPM of a branch of the Post Office located
within a Mace Convenience Store in Gillingham.

She pleaded guilty to three allegations of false accounting at Medway
Magistrates’ Court on 19 January 2006. The total amount involved was
£52,864.08. There were also a number of matters taken into account
(‘TICs’).

It was accepted that at some point prior to Mrs. Adedayo’s interview
under caution, a piece of paper containing her written confession was
created and signed by her and by the auditor. The CCRC has not
been able to locate a copy of this confession.

In the interview, Mrs. Adedayo admitted to taking the money to repay
family members who had lent her and her husband £50,000. These
family members were demanding repayment. Mrs. Adedayo attempted
to raise the money owed via a loan but she was unsuccessful in doing
this.

Mrs. Adedayo pleaded guilty to withdrawing £20,000, £10,000 and
£20,000 which had been paid to the relatives. She made false entries
in her weekly accounts which showed what the accounts would have
been had she not done this. The three dates of the offences were the
dates on which the money was withdrawn.

The TIC offences related to entries made in the weekly accounts which
showed incorrect figures.

The matter was committed to Maidstone Crown Court for sentence as
the District Judge felt the Magistrates’ powers of sentence were
insufficient.

The Crown Court sentenced Mrs. Adedayo to 50 weeks’ imprisonment
suspended for 2 years with 12 months’ probation and 200 hours
unpaid work.

A confiscation order was made for £52,864.08 and this was paid in full
by Mrs. Adedayo.

As Mrs. Adedayo pleaded guilty in the Magistrates’ Court, she had no
right of appeal against her conviction.

Mrs. Adedayo’s Submissions

11. In addition to the general submissions referenced at paragraph 35 of
the referral SoR, Mrs. Adedayo’s particular submissions can be
summarised as follows:

Her confession was ‘involuntary and false’. She was coerced into
pleading guilty and told it would be better for her to plead guilty,
accept liability and pay back the money rather than proving her
innocence.

She was told that if she paid back the money, the Post Office
would not prosecute.

There was no proper explanation from the Post Office as to how
the loss came about even though her solicitor raised issues with
them in relation to discrepancies.

She was reminded of the contract she signed stating she would
make good any shortages. In hindsight she now knows the
exclusion clause was unfair.

She was coerced into coming up with a statement to explain how
the money went missing.

She made many calls to the helpline to tell them that there were
overpayments or shortages on Horizon. They told her to adjust
the figures in order to rollover as otherwise she could not operate
the next day. She only did this because the Post Office told her
to.

. She was made to feel it was an issue particular to her and

therefore that she must have stolen the money.

. She lied when she said she had used the money to pay back loan

sharks. In fact, the shops were financed by loans from Lloyds
Bank, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Clydesdale Bank. This is
shown by the exhibits she had provided.

Her case was headline news in the paper and on the local radio
stations.

She felt suicidal and unable to function having been coerced into
admitting a crime of which she was not guilty. Her conviction
affected her family and her business and she has found it difficult
to obtain employment since due to her criminal record.

RLITO000185

12. On 3 June 2020, Mrs. Adedayo was sent a Provisional Statement of
Reasons (‘PSoR’) refusing her application. She then instructed
Hudgells Solicitors and they provided further submissions in which
they said:

a.

b.

There was evidence which casts doubt on the veracity of Mrs.
Adedayo’s confession and subsequent admissions in interview.

Moreover, there is reason to believe the Post Office did not
evidence the shortfall in her case but relied solely on her
admissions in prosecuting her.

. The CCRC should take into account the law in relation to

confession evidence. The starting point is that s.76(2) of the
Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (‘PACE’) states:

“If, in any proceedings where the prosecution proposes to give
in evidence a confession made by an accused person, it is
represented to the court that the confession was or may have
been obtained:

a. by oppression of the person who made it; or

b. in consequence of anything said or done which was likely,
in the circumstances exisiting at the time to render
unreliable any confession which might be made by him in
consequence thereof,

the court shall not allow the confession to be given in
evidence against him except in so far as the prosecution
proves to the court beyond reasonable doubt that the
confession (notwithstanding that it may be true) was not
obtained as aforesaid).

. In addition, s.78 of PACE states that if it appears to the court that,

having regard to all the circumstances including the
circumstances in which the evidence was obtained, the admission
of the evidence would have such an adverse effect on the
fairness of proceedings that the court ought not to admit it, there
is a discretion to exclude the confession.

. In considering whether a distinction can be drawn between cases

where the defendant raised the integrity of Horizon before
pleading guilty and cases where a defendant gave a positive
account of their own actions in stealing the money, the CCRC
should consider with great care how and why admissions were
made.

The circumstances in which the confession was given were
problematic:

i. Itis inconceivable that a 45 year old woman of positive good
character with no experience of the court system would write a

7 of 19
00610/2015 - 008

RLIT0000185
RLITO000185

confession on a piece of paper of her own accord and ask that
the auditor sign it. It follows that the auditor must have had
some involvement in how the confession came to be obtained.

ii. The CCRC may take the view that the language of the
confession is inconsistent with how Mrs. Adedayo expressed
herself in interview.

iii. The case-specific disclosure suggests that due to Mrs.
Adedayo’s guilty plea, no statement was taken from the
auditor.

iv. Mrs. Adedayo’s assertion that she was encouraged to admit
taking the money and offer swift repayment to avoid
prosecution cannot be gainsaid.

v. The confession itself was lacking in key details such as when
Mrs. Adedayo took the money.

. An encouragement to confess made by a Post Office auditor to a

SPM of good character with no knowledge or understanding of
the criminal justice system is plainly capable of amounting to an
inducement for the purposes of s.76(2)(a) and/or (b), although it is
accepted that (b) is more obviously engaged. It is difficult to see
how the written confession which Mrs. Adedayo allegedly handed
to the auditor could have been produced other than with some
inducement from or involvement with the auditor.

. The narrative of Mrs. Adedayo having inflated the cash accounts

did not come from Mrs. Adedayo but rather from the person
interviewing her. The interview as a whole does not demonstrate
any coherence or consistency. This is consistent with Mrs.
Adedayo’s contention that the confession was false.

Once it is accepted the confession and admissions are unreliable,
the CCRC is faced with the difficulty that the losses in this case
do not appear to have been proved in evidence.

Mrs. Adedayo raised at least one issue in respect of Horizon with
the Help Desk eight months earlier.

The CCRC's Review

13. The CCRC carried out a lengthy review of the convictions of the Post
Office applicants. The numerous enquiries which the CCRC carried out
are summarised at paragraph 37 of the referral SoR. Ultimately,
however, it is the CCRC’s analysis of the High Court’s ‘Common
Issues’ and ‘Horizon Issues’ judgments and consideration of PACE
s.76 which have formed the basis of the CCRC’s decision to refer Mrs.
Adedayo’s conviction for appeal.

Analysis and Reasons
Abuse of Process

14.

15.

16.

The CCRC has considered the issues raised by the submissions of
the Post Office applicants regarding the Horizon system, in
particular taking into account the ‘Common Issues’ Judgment and
the ‘Horizon Issues’ Judgment in the civil case. It is the conclusion of
the CCRC that the findings of the High Court represent a
fundamental shift in understanding with regard to the operation of
the Post Office Horizon system, and particularly on the reliability of
that system and the accuracy of the branch accounts which it
produced. The CCRC further concludes that the High Court's
findings have established that the Horizon system is far less reliable
than it was presented as being at the time of the prosecution of Mrs.
Adedayo in 2004.

The CCRC considers that there are a number of findings in the High
Court judgments (see the list of key findings at paragraph 112 of the
referral SoR) which, taken together, are of potential significance to
the convictions of the Post Office applicants, including those
applicants who were convicted in the Magistrates’ Court. In the
CCRC’s view, the most important points are:

e That there were significant problems with the Horizon system
and with the accuracy of the branch accounts which it produced.
There was a material risk that apparent branch shortfalls were
caused by bugs, errors and defects in Horizon.

e That POL failed to disclose the full and accurate position
regarding the reliability of Horizon.

e That the level of investigation by POL into the causes of
apparent shortfalls was poor, and that the Post Office applicants
were at a significant disadvantage in seeking to undertake their
own enquiries into such shortfalls.

The CCRC considers that the High Court's findings regarding the
poor level of investigation and of disclosure by POL are particularly
significant in the context of criminal proceedings, including
proceedings in Magistrates’ Courts. The CCRC takes the view that
those findings by the High Court give rise to a cogent argument that
POL failed adequately to discharge its duties - under CPIA 1996 - as
an investigator and/or a prosecutor. In the light of the High Court
judgments, there are significant concerns that POL investigators and
prosecutors did not ensure that all reasonable lines of inquiry were
pursued, but instead routinely assumed a theory of the case which
was adverse to the SPMs under investigation. The High Court
judgments also raise significant concerns that POL prosecutors did
not ensure that all material was disclosed which was capable of
assisting the Post Office applicants.

00610/2015 - 011

17. The referral SoR explores in detail the potential abuse of process
arguments which arise as a result of the findings in the High Court
judgments. The Crown Court is invited to consider the analysis at
paragraphs 111-130 of that SoR. The CCRC considers that that
analysis also applies to the cases of Post Office applicants who
were convicted in Magistrates’ Courts. The CCRC considers that the
findings of the High Court give rise to two possible lines of argument
in relation to abuse of process:

e The reliability of Horizon data was essential to the prosecution
and conviction of the Post Office applicant in question and, in the
light of the High Court's findings, it was not possible for the trial
process to be fair.

e The reliability of Horizon data was essential to the prosecution
and conviction of the Post Office applicant in question and, in the
light of the High Court’s findings, it was an affront to the public
conscience for the Post Office applicant to face criminal
proceedings.

Confession
18. The Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (‘PACE’) states:

“s.76(2) If, in any proceedings where the prosecution proposes to
give in evidence a confession made by an accused person, it is
represented to the court that the confession was or may have been
obtained:

a. by oppression of the person who made it; or

b. in consequence of anything said or done which was likely, in
the circumstances exisiting at the time to render unreliable any
confession which might be made by him in consequence
thereof,

the court shall not allow the confession to be given in evidence
against him except in so far as the prosecution proves to the court
beyond reasonable doubt that the confession (notwithstanding that
it may be true) was not obtained as aforesaid).

19. In addition, s.78 of PACE states that if it appears to the court that,
having regard to all the circumstances including the circumstances in
which the evidence was obtained, the admission of the evidence would
have such an adverse effect on the fairness of proceedings that the
court ought not to admit it, there is a discretion to exclude the
confession.

20. In R v Barry (1992) 95 Cr.App.R. 384, it was said that s.76(2)(b)
requires the Judge to adopt a three step process:

1. Identifying what was said or done;

11 of 19
00610/2015 -

21

22.

23.

RLIT0000185
RLITO000185

012

2. Asking whether what was said or done was likely in the
circumstances to render unreliable a confession made in
consequence, the test being objective

3. Asking whether the prosecution have proved beyond
reasonable doubt that the particular confession was not
obtained in consequence of the thing said or done.

. While it is now known that Horizon figures cannot be relied upon (at

least in respect of the relevant period for Mrs. Adedayo, up to
September 2005) for the reasons given in the attached referral SoR,
the CCRC considers that for Post Office representatives to put to an
SPM in interview apparent losses recorded by Horizon could not in
itself amount to ‘oppression’ for the purposes of s.76(2)(a), nor to
something said or done which was likely to render unreliable a
confession made in consequence, for the purposes of s.76(2)(b). The
CCRC remains of this same view even where the making of the
confession and a subsequent guilty plea meant that the losses were
not evidenced in court. Instead, the CCRC considers that the
circumstances of the confession must be considered in order to
determine on the particular facts whether s.76(2)(a) and/or s.76(2)(b)
might apply.

It was due to her confession that the CCRC originally provisionally
refused Mrs. Adedayo's application ina PSoR. The CCRC stated:

a. There was no indication that Mrs. Adedayo’s confession was
false, that she was coerced into coming up with an
explanation for the missing money or that the Post Office told
her that if she paid back the money they would not prosecute.

b. There was no evidence from the time of the original
proceedings to support Mrs. Adedayo’s claim to have called
the helpline on multiple occasions.

c. Mrs. Adedayo’s original account of events (i.e. that she took
the money to repay loans) gave no room for Horizon errors to
have occurred.

d. Adistinction could be drawn between those cases in which
the applicant gave a positive account of their own actions in
stealing the money — as Mrs. Adedayo did - and those in
which the applicant denied taking money and/or raised issues
with Horizon at the time of trial but faced with no evidential
basis on which to challenge the reliability of Horizon entered a
guilty plea.

Mrs. Adedayo’s solicitors have submitted that the CCRC should take
into account the circumstances in which her confession was given. It
is their view that the circumstances in which the confession was
provided were problematic and that there is nothing to contradict Mrs.
Adedayo’s assertion that she was encouraged to admit taking the
money and offer swift repayment to avoid prosecution, particularly as

24.

25.

26.

30.

there is no statement from the auditor who witnessed her original
‘confession note’. The solicitors also state that Mrs. Adedayo’s
confession was lacking in key details such as when she had taken the
money.

Having considered the matter further, it is the view of the CCRC that
there is a real possibility the Crown Court would exclude Mrs.
Adedayo’s confession under s.76(2)(b) of PACE.

In Mrs. Adedayo’s case, the CCRC has been unable to consider the
original confession document since it appears no longer to be
available. While there appears to be no doubt that such a document
did exist, since it is referenced in the transcript of Mrs. Adedayo’s
interview and in other documents, the circumstances of its creation are
disputed. Mrs. Adedayo states that it was not spontaneously drafted
and handed to the auditor, Mr. Valani, as appears to have been
suggested in the original proceedings, but rather that he handed it to
her to sign. It appears to be correct that a statement was not provided
by Mr. Valani and therefore his account of events is not available.

It is the view of the CCRC that there is evidence that the prior
conversation with the auditor occurred but there is no
contemporaneous evidence of what was said in that conversation.
The CCRC therefore considers that it could not now be established
beyond reasonable doubt that Mrs. Adedayo was not induced to
confess by something said by Mr Valani which was likely to render her
confession unreliable, namely that if she confessed and repaid the
money, she would not be prosecuted.

Mrs. Adedayo has provided a reasonable explanation for not having
challenged the confession at the time, namely that it was her word
against that of the Post Office and there was no real prospect of her
account being found to be credible. That situation has now changed in
particular as a result of what is now known about the reliability of
Horizon during the period in question (that is, for Mrs Adedayo, up until
the audit of her branch in September 2005).

It is the view of the CCRC that the fact that Mrs. Adedayo’s answers in
interview were incoherent and vague adds to the credibility of what she
is now saying, i.e. that her confession was false and was induced by
what Mr Valani said to her.

Since the CCRC has found there is a real possibilty the Crown Court
will find the confession should be excluded under s.76(2)(b) of PACE,
it has not been necessary for the CCRC to consider whether or not
there was also oppression under s.72(2)(a). Section 78 of PACE has
also not been considered for the same reason.

While there is now evidence that Mrs. Adedayo made one call to the
Helpline in January 2005 about a ‘balancing issue’, there is no

13 of 19
00610/2015 - 014

evidence that other calls were made as stated by Mrs. Adedayo. This
is therefore not a factor relied upon by the CCRC in making this
referral.

Guilty Plea

31.

32.

In considering the above arguments, the CCRC has not overlooked
that Mrs. Adedayo pleaded guilty to the charges against her. The legal
principles regarding appeals following guilty pleas are discussed at
paragraphs 132-137 of the referral SoR, with the CCRC noting in
particular those cases where guilty pleas had been entered without the
benefit of adequate disclosure from the prosecution. The CCRC stated
at paragraph 137 of that document that it considered it “to be of clear
importance that a defendant who is considering his or her plea should
have an accurate understanding of the prosecution case against them,
and is not misled about the strength of that prosecution case”.

The subject of guilty pleas was further explored at paragraphs 171-174
and 182 of the referral SoR. At paragraph 182 the CCRC summarised
the position as follows:

“The applicants in question were prosecuted and required to decide
how to plead in circumstances where they had incomplete and indeed
misleading information about the reliability of Horizon. Any legal advice
these applicants were given as to plea could only have been based on
the situation in regard to Horizon as it was understood to be at the time,
and not as it is now understood in the light of the High Court judgments.
POL's position throughout all the criminal proceedings was that Horizon
was feliable, and so pleas of guilty were entered in the context of that
flawed understanding.”

Conclusion
33. The CCRC has considered Mrs. Adedayo’s case in the light of the

above points and has considered whether there is a real possibility:

(i) that the Crown Court would set aside her plea of guilty;

(ii) that the Crown Court would exclude her confession; and

(iii) if the plea of guilty were set aside and the confession
excluded, that, if her case were to be re-tried before the
Crown Court on appeal, a defence application for the
proceedings to be stayed as an abuse of process would be
successful.

34. In making its assessment, the CCRC has considered whether the

reliability of Horizon data was (and still remains) essential to the
prosecution and conviction of Mrs. Adedayo.

RLIT0000185
RLITO000185
00610/2015 - 015

35.

36.

37.

According to Mrs. Adedayo’s account of events, there were
unexplained branch losses and her admissions were encouraged by
employees of the Post Office who told her that if she admitted to taking
the money and made arrangements to pay it back, she could avoid
prosecution. It is therefore the view of the CCRC that unexplained
losses were an important part of the context to Mrs. Adedayo’s
admission that she used Post Office funds to repay borrowed money.

In those circumstances, the CCRC is satisfied that the reliability of
Horizon data was essential to the prosecution and conviction of Mrs.
Adedayo, and that this would remain the situation if she were to be re-
tried now. The CCRC therefore considers that, if the case were to be
heard as a Crown Court appeal, there would be cogent arguments,
based upon the abuse of process analysis set out in the referral SoR
and summarised at paragraph 13 above and on the s.76 argument set
out at paragraphs 18-27 above, that Mrs. Adedayo’s guilty plea should
be set aside, her confession should be excluded and that any further
proceedings against her should be stayed.

For the above reasons, the CCRC considers that there is a real
possibility that the Crown Court will set aside Mrs. Adedayo’s guilty
plea, exclude her confession and will stay any further proceedings
against her as an abuse of process. The CCRC accordingly concludes
that there is a real possibility that Mrs. Adedayo’s appeal against
conviction will be successful.

Decision to Refer

38.

The CCRC has decided to refer this conviction under section 11 of the
Act and this statement sets out the CCRC's reasons in accordance
with section 14(4) of the Act. This decision has been made by a
committee consisting of three Commissioners in accordance with
paragraph 6 of Schedule 1 to the Act and is signed by one of the
committee on behalf of the CCRC.

39. In accordance with section 14(4A) the Act as inserted by section 315

of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, this conviction is being referred on
the following grounds:

e In view of the findings of the High Court in Alan Bates & Ors v
Post Office Ltd (Judgment No 3) “Common Issues” [2019]
EWHC 606 (QB) and Alan Bates & Ors v Post Office Ltd
(Judgment No 6) “Horizon Issues” [2019] EWHC 3408 (QB),
there is a real possibility that the Crown Court will set aside Mrs.
Adedayo’s plea of guilty and will stay any further proceedings
against him as an abuse of process.

40. Although Mrs. Adedayo has not previously appealed against her

conviction, the CCRC considers that there are exceptional
circumstances which justify making a reference in the absence of a
previous appeal, in accordance with section 13(2) of the Act. The
exceptional circumstances are that she pleaded guilty in the
Magistrates’ Court and therefore had no right of appeal against
conviction, meaning that a CCRC referral is Mrs. Adedayo’s only
prospect of a remedy.

Annex 2

Summary of the CCRC’s powers to refer

The CCRC may refer a conviction to the court if:

1. there is a real possibility that the conviction would be overturned if it
were referred; and

2. this real possibility arises from evidence or argument which was not put
forward at trial or appeal (or there are exceptional circumstances’);
and

3. the applicant has already appealed or applied for leave to appeal
against conviction (or there are exceptional circumstances

> “Exceptional circumstances” to allow us to refer a case without something ‘new’ are extremely rare.
*“Exceptional circumstances” to allow us to refer a case where there has not been an earlier appeal

are very rare. There has to be a good reason why there has been no appeal and why there cannot be
an appeal now without the CCRC’s help.
