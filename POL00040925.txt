Rodric

As discussed yesterday, please find attached the pack of letters that I think need sending to tie off the legal issues. This
includes:

« Termination Notice to SS

e Work Plan for SS (+ confid / publicity obligations)
e Closure of scheme letters

e Letter to Kay re her fees.

Belinda, Tom, Patrick - I've copied you so that you can see the state of play but you might want to wait for Rod and I to
bash this into shape before commenting (though comments are always welcomed!).
