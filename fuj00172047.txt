Graham,

Gerald has produced a fix for release 1 and it is ready to go

He has added an impact statement to the Peak that includes a brief statement on testing: An audit
request should be performed that retrieves and processes TMS files containing duplicate transactions.
It should then be confirmed that the duplicate transactions have been removed from the final
spreadsheet generated by the audit application.

The Peak is currently with RMF for targeting.

There has been discussion of a possible workaround. This involves modifying the audit queries so that
the message numbers are included in the output to the spreadsheets (currently they are not). This
would allow the duplicate messages to be identified and removed by running a macro on the final
spreadsheet generated by the application.

Penny Thomas is in discussion with POL over whether this workaround is acceptable in the short term

Where are we with the fix for this? Is it ready yet?

Can we impact the peak with a view as to what testing will be required please?

(We have seen cases of duplicate message numbers — not duplicate messages themselves — in HNG-
X data. These will not be removed by this fix so there will still be a need for PC0194639 to highlight
the duplicates.)

This Peak was proposed for release 01.23 and is currently with RMF for targeting.


PCO194639

This Peak is probably less serious. The information that shows that duplicates have been found in the
data is displayed to the user but may be hard to spot in large output. The purpose of the Peak is to
highlight more clearly that duplicates have been found.

We do not yet have a fix - it will take 2 - 3 man days.

Subject: FW: PCO200468 - Duplication of Transaction Records

All,

Please see below and attached FYI. I n essence we have a problem with the ARQ extraction tool. Under
Horizon this would inhibit the duplicate transactions held from the Audit Server and thus supply evidence for
Court etc without duplicated records.

However the HNGx tool does not and thus duplicate records that can not be differentiated are supplied as
evidence. Thus could allow for legal challenge to the integrity of the system.

               I will add to CS Prayers but your chances of getting it fixed before R2 is deployed are
        not good.

              Can I suggest that you explain the urgency to Graham and get him to raise it at
        management prayers?

                  Can you also add a business impact to the peak using the Impact button?

Subject: PCO200468 - Duplication of Transaction Records

Hi Pat

We have a very significant problem which has been recorded in PEAK PCO200468. In a nut
shell the HNG-X application is not removing duplicate transactions (which may have been
recorded twice on the Audit Server) and they are appearing in the ARQ returns. For the old
Horizon application Riposte automatically removed duplicate entries. An initial analysis
shows that one third of all ARQ returns (since the new application has been in play) have
duplicated transactions.

Also, we have a PEAK PCO194639 which would highlight any duplication of records (this
obviously isn't happening now).

Kind regards
Penny
