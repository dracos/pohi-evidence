Following discussions just now in the daily R1-R2 interlock meeting, we have discussed delivering this fix with Release
2

Could you please confirm whether this fix could be delivered for 02.07.10 (that is, to go directly into LST on 10 July).
| understand the code fix has been made for R1, but would need merging into the R2 Audit code base.

Chris & RM,

Can you please target and move this peak forward to get in onto / available for LST as soon as possible, appreciating that it
probably has to go through integration etc. The sooner this is resolved the easier the task will be in managing POL

expectations in this area whilst minimising the risk of duplicated effort by having to reproduce the reports already provided.

Thanks for the update guess we will watch out for etc.

Graham,

Gerald has produced a fix for release 1 and it is ready to go.

He has added an impact statement to the Peak that includes a brief statement on testing: An audit
request should be performed that retrieves and processes TMS files containing duplicate transactions.
It should then be confirmed that the duplicate transactions have been removed from the final
spreadsheet generated by the audit application.

The Peak is currently with RMF for targeting.

There has been discussion of a possible workaround. This involves modifying the audit queries so that
the message numbers are included in the output to the spreadsheets (currently they are not). This
would allow the duplicate messages to be identified and removed by running a macro on the final
spreadsheet generated by the application.

Penny Thomas is in discussion with POL over whether this workaround is acceptable in the short term.

Gerald has prepared and started testing a fix for this problem that will remove the duplicate messages
from the Horizon transaction data. It should take him about 1 day to complete the testing and
handover a new baseline.

(We have seen cases of duplicate message numbers — not duplicate messages themselves — in HNG-
X data. These will not be removed by this fix so there will still be a need for PC0194639 to highlight
the duplicates.)

This Peak was proposed for release 01.23 and is currently with RMF for targeting.

PC0194639

This Peak is probably less serious. The information that shows that duplicates have been found in the
data is displayed to the user but may be hard to spot in large output. The purpose of the Peak is to
highlight more clearly that duplicates have been found.

We do not yet have a fix - it will take 2 - 3 man days.

The Peak is currently proposed for release 02.11 and is with RMF for targeting. (We may want to
propose/target this for an earlier release if Penny considers it to be important.)

All,

Please see below and attached FYI. I n essence we have a problem with the ARQ extraction tool. Under
Horizon this would inhibit the duplicate transactions held from the Audit Server and thus supply evidence for

Court etc without duplicated records.

However the HNGx tool does not and thus duplicate records that can not be differentiated are supplied as
evidence. Thus could allow for legal challenge to the integrity of the system.

Hi Pat

We have a very significant problem which has been recorded in PEAK PC0200468. In a nut
shell the HNG-X application is not removing duplicate transactions (which may have been
recorded twice on the Audit Server) and they are appearing in the ARQ returns. For the old
Horizon application Riposte automatically removed duplicate entries. An initial analysis
shows that one third of all ARQ returns (since the new application has been in play) have
duplicated transactions.

Also, we have a PEAK PC0194639 which would highlight any duplication of records (this
obviously isn’t happening now).

Kind regards
Penny
