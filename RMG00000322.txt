REMUNERATION COMMITTEE

EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR BONUSES: ASSESSING EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR PERFORMANCE
AGAINST OBJECTIVES

2010-11 was the first year in which executive Directors received
detailed objectives, including personal objectives. Letters were
sent in early May 2010 to each executive Director setting out the
objectives and bonus potential against each objective.

The purpose of this note is to summarise the achievement of each
executive Director against these objectives and to propose payouts
in accordance with these assessments.

Mark Higson

During the year Mark Higson’s role changed from MD Letters to
Director of Operations and Modernisation. The first four measures
remained appropriate in his new role, but his personal objectives
changed (two of the original personal objectives fell away).

Paula Vennells

Paula Vennells’ role changed twice, from POL Network Director to COO
to MD. To calculate her bonus we have used as a base the letter sent
to Dave Smith, as MD POL. Paula Vennells was appointed MD POL on

Dave Smith

As noted above Dave Smith’s target letter was based on his new
appointment as MD POL. In October 2010 he was appointed Chief
Customer Officer. It seems appropriate to use the same criteria as
for Paula Vennells for the first six months, i.e. 37.95% of salary.

For the remaining 6 months he has operated on the basis of a letter
from the CEO which specifies focus on the following personal
objectives:

e Growing our non-regulated business

e Provision of true customer-service excellence

* Reviewing our sales channels to ensure segmented customer
groups are served appropriately

e Smooth introduction of the special price increase delivering
£80m and develop strategies to minimise volume decline

e Taking a full and active role as a Chief Executive Committee
member to influence the wider RMG’s profit maximising
strategies.

These accounted for 12% of salary for on-target performance. The
CEO has recommended that his performance against these objectives
deserves a 75% award.

Accordingly, the table below sets out his performance against
various objectives for the last six months of the year:

In addition, the CEO raised the issue of an increase in Dave Smith’s
salary to reflect his considerable increase in responsibilities,
with the Minister in October 2010. We are still awaiting
confirmation of this and believe that we should assign the increased
salary from 1 January 2011. Accordingly the following table applies

Moya Greene

Moya joined on 15 July 2010, thus she is eligible for bonus for 75%
of the year. Exceptionally she was given personal objectives only,
with a maximum potential bonus of 100% of salary for just over 9

months.

Matthew Lester

Matthew Lester joined on 24** November 2010. He is therefore
entitled to bonus of one third of the year. His objectives derived
from Moya Greene’s objectives; additionally he agreed to the
following:

© Follow through on the Maxxim study to ensure a more effcient
structure for the finance function.

* Ensure an emphasis on cash generation throughout the business.

* Lead the development of the business plans required for the
various processes associated with the strategic intention to
obtain relief from the historic pension liabilities and the
introduction of private capital.

We believe that the most appropriate treatment given the short
tenure is to award the same level of achievement as the CEO, i.e.
achieving an overall figure of 38% of salary, which when adjusted to
one third of the year gives a figure of 12.67% of salary. Matthew
Lester’s salary is £428,400 and his proposed bonus is therefore
£54,264.
