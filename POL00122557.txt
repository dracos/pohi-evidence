Subject: Draft Case Review policy and key points document

Andrew,

I have made some amendments additions to my introduction and key points to be embedded into the guidelines.
These are in red font for ease of reference. I have also drafted out a forward. I envisage that the forward, flow chart
and section index will go in with para ref as oppose to page which I think will be easier. I have also attached your
procedures doc where I have made comment again in red font.

All,

With regards to our meeting on Tuesday, I’m sure there will be considerable debate and I would ask that you read
these documents or indeed any updated version from Andrew prior to the meeting.

Regards

Rob
