  prevailed.

INTEGRITY OF LEGACY HORIZON SYSTEM


    38.1 was asked to consider document Horizon Integrity -- Dave Smith

        [POL00090575]. I was asked to explain why I wrote this slide show. There

        was growing interest in the assertion being made by a group of sub-

        postmasters that Horizon was the cause of errors in their calculated office

        cash balance. This attracted the interest of Group Public Relations who

        were concerned about this and were trying to get some traction with senior

        Post Office management in framing a response. I can't be                 but I think

                                                                          sure
        it was they who convened a meeting to bring interested parties together to

        discuss the situation and frame a response. This meeting fell sometime

        between the last week in February and the first week in March (I am

        certain of this as I was in Mexico during this period and have date stamped

        photos).

    39.1 prepared this document as an input to that meeting. In my last few days

        at the Post Office, I used a version of this document          urge my Director to
                                                                  to




        raise this matter with colleagues. I will have previously briefed him on this

        matter and as both Service Management and Security reported to him he

        was well placed to gain others input.

40.6 was asked to explain what I meant by "in order to win the argument we

   have to focus it on what actually happened and not allow others to conduct

   the debate around speculation about what might have happened". What

   did you consider had "actually happened".

41. Firstly, my reference to "what actually happened" meant using the audit

   trail to reconstruct the office balance and prove that in fact Horizon had not

   caused an error in the office balance. I had a further discussion with the

   security lead on audit trail. He confirmed that all cases where the audit trail

   had been put to use had been found in the Post Offices favour. He also

   mentioned that in a number of cases disclosure to the defence of the

   intention to extract the audit file and the use to which it was put caused the

   Sub-postmaster to change their plea from not guilty to guilty.

42. Secondly this refers to the fact that, with the exception of Castleton, I did

   not know the detailed background to the cases of the small group of Sub-

   postmasters who first raised the issue. I had assumed that they all had

   been pursued through the courts. This understanding changed, at least in

   one case; when I was asked to support the Chairman of the Welsh Postal

   Board in a meeting with the MP to whom Mr Bates had written raising the

   issue of Horizon. To say we received a hostile reception would be an

   understatement. However, between the Chairman and the retail line

   representative the MP listened to a very detailed description of the history

   of the Post Office's interaction with Mr Bates. The MP completely changed

   his stance. From my point of view I learned that understanding what had
