Why are leadership behaviours important to POL

As leaders, we all have a critical role in creating an environment where these behaviours live and breathe; we make these
important, they will also become important to our teams and drive culture change.

¢ [tis important to describe the Leadership Behaviours that are important to
POL

¢ Leadership Behaviours are the most influential factor shaping organisation
culture

e Leadership Behaviours will help us grow talent (individuals and teams)

¢ Having consistent behaviours across our leadership teams will allow us to
achieve more together (the whole is greater than the sum of the parts)

¢ Will we embed Leadership Behaviours in all our people processes (job specs,
recruitment, succession, development, 360 assessment).

¢ Our Leadership Behaviours will be introduced to the whole of POL and
all leaders will be measured against them

Strong Leadership Behaviours will increase colleague / PM engagement & trust
