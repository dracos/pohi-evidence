Please see copy of email to Mark from Penny

1 can now advise that the enhancement to delete duplicated records from our returns has been developed
and is with test and is expected to be deployed on our application on Sunday, 1 August.

Once this has happened we will re-run retrievals where duplication is known to have been present and
report the outcome to you.

We have not yet received confirmation from POL that the proposed workaround for duplicated records is
acceptable; we await your instruction.

Kind regards
Penny

Security Analyst, Customer Services

Once this has been completed I have to prioritise all outstanding requests before Penny will undertake the
re-work. Obviously yours is going to be a high priority but I am unable to say at this stage ifthe
information will be available in time for you to submit the committal papers

Any problems please give me aring

Hi Sharron

Iam attaching a file which shows how the duplicate entries look on the ARQ requests - they
are at the bottom highlighted in yellow.

Do you know how to decrypt the requests because you will need to do this on the attachment -
I will send you instructions and the password.

Penny has very kindly offered to talk you through this in preparation for the second interview
as I am still just getting to grips with it myself.

Dear Both
Please see email below from Penny Thomas.

Mark, Alan Simpson and myself have had a conference call today to
look at potential problems that this is likely to cause. Firstly the
suggested workaround will need to be put to our Legal Team and until
that has been agreed any further ARQ requests, including those which
have already been submitted, will be suspended.

There are 2 cases currently with the court - West Byfleetand Porters
Avenueand I will speak to Lisa and Jon about these as we need to
know what in the way of ARQs and the corresponding statements have
been presented to court. In addition I have identified the following
offices from the casework spreadsheet as ones that potentially could
have already had information presented to the court. Could you please
confirm whether or not this is the case and also whether there are any
that I have missed as Fujitsu will need to take corrective action.

Trealise that this is a lot to digest but if you need to speak to me for
any clarification before you forward to your teams then please give me
a ring. Also can you let me know if you think of any further problems
that this could cause.

30/06/2010 13:33 Subject: Duplicatation of Transaction Records
in ARQ Returns

Sue/Mark/Jane

We have identified that a number of recent ARQ returns contain
duplicated transaction records.

With Horizon counters, the mechanism by which Data is audited
has always worked on the principle that it is acceptable to audit
the same data more than once — in particular if in doubt as to
whether or not it has been previously audited successfully.

The Mechanism used on Horizon to retrieve the data took this
into account and only presented one instance of such duplicate
data in the ARQ extracts.

However it has recently been noticed that the HNG-X retrieval
mechanism does not remove such duplicates and a quick scan
of the ARQs provided to Post Office Ltd since the change to the
new system indicates that about 35% of the ARQs might contain
some duplicate data. A Peak has been raised to enhance the
extraction toolset and remove such duplicate data in the future.
However until the fix is developed, tested and deployed, there is
a possibility that data is duplicated.

The reliable way to identify a duplicate transaction is to use the
<Num> attribute that is used to generate the unique sequence
numbers. This attribute is not currently included in the Excel
version of ARQ data that has been passed to Post Office Ltd in
the past. This will be included in all future ARQs until the
problem is fixed. A workaround, using the <NUM> attribute is
suggested, and a detailed process is attached.

Note that we have identified a scenario with Postal Services

26/07/2010

POL-0142612
POL00141225
POL00141225

transactions where multiple, identical mails items are accepted
(ie the Quantity button is set to greater than 1), but Postage
Labels are printed for each individual item. This results in
separate transactions being generated for each item, which are
identical in the ARQ extracts (there is another minor difference
in the raw data apart from the <Num> attribute, but this different
attribute is not currently included in the ARQ extract).

I've put together a spreadsheet detailing affected ARQs, which
is also attached.

Mark/Jane I’ve tried to call you both this morning but I
understand you are both tied up. Please call and we can
discuss.

Kind regards
Penny/Tom
