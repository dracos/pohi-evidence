Please find attached note that we discussed with the Minister yesterday regarding the Post Office Horizon
issue and potential group civil action against Post Office.

A

The Minister asked for a sense of timescales. Until a letter of claim is received by Post Office and they
are informed of the details of the claim, it is difficult to judge timescales, but we will provide
further updates as and when we receive any. The solicitors state that the letter of claim will be sent to
POL within 14 days.

Rob, George 4€“ happy to chat through any additional background if intend to put this to your
SpAds/Minister.

Thanks
