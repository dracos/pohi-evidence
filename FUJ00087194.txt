OCP 17510 Completed

Write corrective bureau message for FAD 183227

A single SC message 183227-7-1101211 was written in error on 26th November
at 12:43:17, selling 1000 US dollars, with no corresponding settlement line. To
remove the effects of this message at both the branch and on POLFS, we will
insert a new message to negate the effects of the original message.

Justification: If the change is not made in the counter messagestore (before the
stock unit is balanced on Wednesday), the branch will have an unexpected gain of
Â£484 (or thereabouts - depends on exchange rate), and a receipts and payments
mismatch, This gain would have to be resolved at the branch. There would also
be an inconsistency between the branch and POLFS to be resolved. By correcting
the problem locally, the branch may not be aware of the problem, and there will
be no inconsistency between the branch and POLFS.

When: Planned for 10/12/2007 17:00 with a duration of 10 mins

Extra detail: The original message had ProductNo:5129, Qty:1, SaleValue:484,
PQty:1000. The new message will have Qty:-1, SaleValue:-484, PQty:-1000, with
other attributes (including exchange rate) as before.

The message will include a comment to show it has been inserted to resolve this
problem (this will not be visible to the branch).

This change will first be applied to a copy of the messagestore within the SSC
environment, and the stock unit then rolled over to make sure there are no
unexpected consequences.

Neither the new nor the old message will be included in data sent to POLFS.

Gary Blackburn (POL) is already aware of this issue.

Regression: None . Regression will take 0

Hi Gaby,

POL approve this change.

As soon as I saw the branch name, I realised that this is the one that
Gary spoke to Anne Chambers about earlier.

I don't need to call to discuss, thank you.
