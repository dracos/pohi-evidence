Setting the Stage for Understanding Culture

NOTES:

Power of informal systems on behaviour.

INFORMAL SYSTEMS are stronger influencers
than FORMAL SYSTEMS when it comes to
encouraging conduct and developing culture.

Decision derailers such as PRESSURE, FEAR,
ASPIRATION, or perceived FAIRNESS can
lead a person to choose an action that is
misaligned with their espoused belief in
doing the right thing. Many ethics and
compliance programmes do not include
measures to combat these decision
derailers.

Introduction to Psychological Safety

What is psychological safety?

In a culture built on psychological safety,
there is a shared belief that the environment
is conducive to taking interpersonal risks or
engaging in acts of vulnerability such as:

[e) Qy Giving and receiving feedback

iam)

Admitting when a mistake was made

Questioning assumptions

Asking for help

/ Ks
aD?
(2) Asking a question

A healthy culture, a psychologically safe culture,
exists where these actions of everyday
interpersonal vulnerability are rewarded as
opposed to punished. It is a culture that has a
learning mindset and embodies the reality that
things will go wrong but we will catch them and
learn from them.

The costs are real when employees hold back
their full participation. Psychologically safe
environments illicit a performance response and
encourage people to take action. Unsafe
environments that place a focus on assigning
blame, excluding those who raise concerns, and
encourage concealing failures, provoke a fear
response, creating distraction and diminishing
performance.

An environment where it is safe to speak up can
drive innovation in addition to alerting an
organisation about problems or concerns. People
who may have solutions to problems, have ideas
for product improvements, have closest contact
with clients or are otherwise in a position to
offer insights or spot hazards, may choose to
remain quiet in environments in which speaking
up is a risky or dangerous activity, or in
environments where being silent is rewarded.

Every employee, but most importantly the direct manager, has an influence on an organisation’s culture.
Culture can be created by design or by default. One way that managers can transform culture, is to model
and reward acts of vulnerability, which creates an environment where people feel comfortable speaking

up.

Stakeholder Impact
Map and Matrix

Use the Stakeholder Impact Map and
Matrix to better understand the risk and
opportunities created by any project or
product across a range of stakeholders.

For each stakeholder on the impact map,
complete the Stakeholder Impact Matrix.
Think about the positive and negative
impacts of the product or project on each
stakeholder group and then identify actions
to take to amplify positive impacts and
mitigate negative impacts. Remember that
the greatest risk or opportunity may not be
with the stakeholder closest to the product
or project.
