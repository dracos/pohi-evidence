POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY

SECOND CORPORATE STATEMENT OF FUJITSU SERVICES LIMITED

|, MR. WILLIAM PAUL PATTERSON (known as Paul Patterson), will say as follows:

INTRODUCTION

1.

| am a director of Fujitsu Services Limited (“Fujitsu”) and am duly authorised to
make this statement on its behalf. | make this statement in response to the
Inquiry’s Rule 9 Request, dated 17 August 2022, for a corporate statement
addressing issues relevant to Phases 2 and 3 of the Inquiry (the “Request”). |
am informed by Morrison Foerster, the Recognised Legal Representative for
Fujitsu in the Inquiry, that an extension to this deadline has been agreed for the
response to the issues relevant to Phase 3 to 14 October 2022.

On 28 September 2022, Fujitsu provided to the Inquiry a signed corporate
statement addressing the issues relevant to Phase 2, namely Questions 1 — 43
as set out in Appendix 1 to the Request (the “First Corporate Statement”). This
corporate statement deals with the issues relevant to Phase 3, namely Questions
44 —71 as set out in Appendix 1 to the Request.

As noted in the First Corporate Statement, | do not have first-hand knowledge of
many of the matters which are set out in this corporate statement. For this

reason, | wish to reiterate at the outset how the information in this statement has

Page 1 of 193
FUJ00126035

FUJ00126035

been compiled. For the purposes of preparing responses, | have been assisted
by a team of individuals within Fujitsu and Morrison Foerster. This is due to the
vast amount of documentation and sources of evidence which have had to be
reviewed for a time period stretching over 25 years. This team has provided to
me the documents which are referenced in this statement and exhibited at
FSL_04/1 to FSL_04/640, and which are the principal source of my knowledge
of this statement’s contents.

As with the responses in the First Corporate Statement, responses to questions
set out in this statement are generally drawn from documentary sources. These
documents have been exhibited and/or referenced in accordance with the
Inquiry’s Protocol on Witness Statements. The responses provided in this second
corporate statement represent Fujitsu’s current understanding of the information
available. Given that preparations for Phase 3 of the Inquiry are still on-going, it
may be that Fujitsu will need to supplement this corporate statement as further
material is identified and made available to Core Participants.

Also, as noted in the First Corporate Statement, | do not have a detailed technical
knowledge of the Horizon IT System (“Horizon”), and | am reliant upon Fujitsu

staff with relevant technical expertise and knowledge of such matters.

SUPPORT

6.

In the Request, the Inquiry has asked a series of questions relating to the nature
and scope of the support services that ICL Pathway Limited (“ICL Pathway”) and
subsequently Fujitsu (for ease of reference, these entities will be referred to
collectively as Fujitsu for this section of the corporate statement) aimed to provide

in relation to Horizon from the initial pilot to the date of the Request.

FUJ00126035

FUJ00126035

From around 2002, the nature and scope of certain support services provided by
Fujitsu to Post Office and its branches are set out in ‘Service Descriptions’. These
are Contract Controlled Documents (“CCDs”) which were agreed between Post
Office and Fujitsu and make up part of the contractual framework between the
parties. For the purposes of this corporate statement, Fujitsu has focused on
support services provided from the time of the Codified Agreement entered into
between Fujitsu and Post Office Counters Limited on 28 July 1999 (the “Codified
Agreement”) that deal with issues that may have impacted Post Office branches
or were reported to Fujitsu (either directly or indirectly) by postmasters and
summarises how those support services have changed over time.

For ease of reference, in this section of the corporate statement, both Post Office
Limited and Post Office Counters Limited (as Post Office Limited was until known
until August 2001) shall be referred to as “POL”. Fujitsu also notes that for
Service Descriptions relating to HNG-X that are dated in 2006, the dates on
which those Service Descriptions became effective are set out in Change Control
Note (“CCN”) 1200 (FSL_04/1). In the majority of instances, this would have been
at the rollout of HNG-X.

ICL Pathway and Fujitsu have undergone a number of reorganisations
throughout the time period relevant to the Request. These reorganisations may
have occurred at the corporate level, business unit or team level, and at individual
account level, including in relation to the account responsible for the provision of
services to POL.

For these reasons, the names, composition and structure of the services, teams,

units and roles which delivered the support services changed, and there will

Page 3 of 193
FUJ00126035
FUJ00126035

therefore be overlap in the responsibilities and time periods relating to the
support services, teams and roles explained below.

Background

11. As documented in Fujitsu’s “Incident Management Process” (see, for example,
FSL_04/2 and FSL_04/3) and “End to End Application Support Strategy” (see,
for example, FSL_04/4 and FSL_04/5), the framework for Fujitsu’s support
services can be broadly categorised into four levels:

a. First line support, which at various times during the Legacy Horizon
and HNG-X periods has included, (i) the Service Desk Service,
delivered by the Service Desk team (the “Service Desk”), where
issues were reported by postmasters, and (ii) Fujitsu’s own system
monitoring, provided by the Systems Management Service and
delivered by the Systems Management Centre (“SMC”);

b. Second line support, which at various times during the Legacy Horizon
and HNG-X periods has included, (i) the SMC, (ii) the Service Desk,
and (iii) the Software Support Centre team (also known as the System
Support Centre) (the “SSC’).

c. Third line support, as provided by the Third Line Support Service,
which was delivered primarily by the SSC; and

d. Fourth line support, as provided by the Application Support Service
(also known during the Legacy Horizon period as ‘4'" line support’),
which was delivered by Fujitsu’s Application Division teams and, later,
some teams based overseas.

12. An ‘incident’ is defined in the Incident Management Process as “any event which

is not part of the standard operation of a service and which causes, or may cause,

Page 4 of 193
13.

14.

15.

FUJ00126035

FUJ00126035

an interruption to, or a reduction in, the quality of that service.” (FSL_04/2 and
FSL_04/3). Incidents included faults or failures in equipment, software, services
or procedures. The term “problem” is defined in the Customer Service Policy
Manual as being “an adverse situation that is: (a) caused by a defect in the
Specification, design, production, implementation or use of any of the service
components and (b) substantial enough to warrant action to eradicate it. A
problem may be indicated by a trend of incidents” (FSL_04/6 and FSL_04/7).
The majority of the support services described below were provided by units and
teams within the Customer Services team, which later became part of Fujitsu’s
Post Office Account (also known at various times as the Royal Mail Group
Account). The Customer Services team’s responsibilities included the delivery of
services to POL under the terms of the contract between Fujitsu and POL
(FSL_04/8 and FSL_04/9).
Although it is not possible to determine with certainty how many individuals were
involved in each of the services or teams described below at any one time, Fujitsu
has to date identified approximately 5,000 employees and/or contractors who
have worked on Horizon over the life of the Horizon contract.
In addition to the information sharing methods set out in respect of the services
outlined below, information was also shared between different levels of support
team using various shared systems. These systems have included:

a. PowerHelp, a call-handling system used by the Service Desk, which

was linked initially to the PiniCL system described below and was in
use until around 2007;
b. PinICL, the customised incident logging and resolution tracking

system adopted by Fujitsu during the period 1996 to 2003;

Page 5 of 193
FUJ00126035

FUJ00126035

Peak, the customised incident logging system designed to replace the
PinlCL system in 2003; and

The Known Error Log (“KEL”), a knowledge management tool used
by Fujitsu to explain how to deal with, or work around, issues that

arose in Horizon.

16. Details relating to the PinICL, Peak and KEL systems were provided to the

17.

18.

Inquiry by Fujitsu in its submissions dated 13 September 2022.

Information was also shared between, by and within support teams through

documentation, training and information-sharing sessions and meetings,

including the following:

a.

team-based review meetings (for example, the Horizon Helpdesk Shift
Review meeting);

local work instructions provided by technical teams to specific support
teams;

the SSC intranet site;

workshops and knowledge transfer sessions (for example, relating to
technical aspects of Horizon and diagnostic techniques); and

internal newsletters and bulletins, including Brief EnCounters and

HSD Voice (see, for example, FSL_04/10 to FSL_04/13).

There were processes for requesting additional resources which line managers

would have followed. This included the Recruitment Authorisation process. Line

managers would create a Recruitment Authorisation Requirement (“RAR’),

which described the role and skills required. An example of a RAR is included at

FSL_04/14. An example of ICL Pathway’s Resourcing Procedure dated 22 June

2000 is included at FSL_04/15.

FUJ00126035
FUJ00126035

19. With regards to the performance of individual team members, between 1993 and
2012, Fujitsu operated a system known as Performance Plus to manage
individual employee performance. This system was renamed Performance First
in 2012 and began incorporating a moderation process in which performance
ratings were applied (FSL_04/16). In general, the process included completion
of a personal objectives form, a personal development plan, a performance
review form, and a pre-appraisal preparation and self-assessment form
(FSL_04/17). Following a performance appraisal exercise, a performance rating
was agreed and, in some cases, it is understood that this could have impacted a
relevant employee’s remuneration.

20. To assess the performance of a team, Fujitsu generally undertook Organisation
and Management Reviews (an “OMR”) during the period. OMRs were an
assessment of a team’s ‘people capability’ against strategic objectives. The OMR
took place at each level of the organisation where there was a formal business
review. Further details of the process are set out in FSL_04/18.

21. Fujitsu understands that training for support service teams was provided on an
ad hoc team-by-team basis and no central register of training was maintained
(FSL_04/19). An example of the induction handbook for individuals working on
the Post Office Account team can be found at FSL_04/20. Further detail in
relation to training provided in respect of certain of the support service teams is
set out below.

Service Management Service

Legacy Horizon

22. The primary aims of the Service Management Service (“SMS”) were to monitor,

manage and maintain the delivery of operational services and to report on these

Page 7 of 193
FUJ00126035
FUJ00126035

matters to the Service Management Forum (which was also known as the

Horizon Service Review Forum) (“Service Management Forum”) (FSL_04/21).

The key components of the SMS including the following operational services

(FSL_04/22):

a.

b.

e.

f.

the Service Desk Service;
Management Information Service;
Reconciliation Service;

Systems Management Service;
Third Line Support Service; and

Engineering Service.

Each of these operational services are discussed below in this statement.

23. The SMS was governed by the procedures defined in Schedule 4 of the Codified

Agreement (FSL_04/22), as varied from time to time, which included:

a.

b.

Service organisation;

Service Management Forum;

The introduction of releases (“Release Introduction’);
Management of problems and complaints; and
Measurement and management of customer satisfaction

(FSL_04/21)

Service organisation

24. The service description sets out key roles within Fujitsu and POL associated with

the SMS (FSL_04/21):

a.

Eujitsu Customer Service Director, responsible for all aspects of the

delivery of the operational services.

Page 8 of 193
FUJ00126035

FUJ00126035

Fujitsu_Infrastructure Service Manager, responsible for delivery of

support services to branches, management information and the
reporting of service levels. The Infrastructure Service Manager was
specifically responsible for the provision of monthly service reports.

Fujitsu Operations and Support Manager, responsible for the delivery

of services relating to data delivery and support.
Fujitsu_Security Manager, responsible for the Security Management
Service.

Fujitsu_Service Introduction Manager, responsible for planning and

managing the implementation of releases, which included planning
and managing the implementation phase of all releases and keeping
POL informed as to the content and progress of all releases. The
Service Introduction Manager was supported by a team (the “Service
Introduction Team”). The prime functional units of the Service
Introduction Team are set out in the Customer Service Operations
Manual (“CS Operations Manual”) (see, for example, FSL_04/23 and
FSL_04/24).

POL Head of Network Support, responsible for the business that the

operational services supported.

POL Supplier & Service Performance Manager, responsible for liaison

with Fujitsu in relation to the overall performance of operational
services. This included monitoring delivered service levels, and
receiving and analysing Fujitsu’s monthly service reports.

POL Service Operations Manager, responsible for liaison with Fujitsu

concerning issues and problems that occurred in the live estate.

Page 9 of 193
FUJ00126035

FUJ00126035

i. POL Information Security Manager, responsible for various security-

related matters, including establishing certain security policies.

Service Management Forum

25. Since at least the date of the Codified Agreement, there has been a contractual

obligation for the parties to hold monthly service review meetings to provide a
regular opportunity for POL and Fujitsu to meet and discuss the overall
performance of services and systems in the live environment (Annex to Schedule
A4, FSL_04/25). Generally, these meetings were called Service Management
Reviews and were held between the Fujitsu’s Customer Service Director and
POL’s Head of Network Support to review performance against Service Level
Targets (“SLTs”), and issues and problems that had been escalated to the
Service Management Forum (FSL_04/21). Service review meetings (“Service
Reviews") were aided by a summary of the service performance statistics for the
month under review. Service Reviews later became known as “Service Review
Books”. The content and format of the Service Review Books changed over time.
Fujitsu has disclosed to the Inquiry all Service Reviews and Service Review
Books identified during the course of its review. These Service Reviews / Service
Review Books recorded, for example, the volume of calls received by the Service

Desk and the part of the system those calls related to.

Release Introduction

26.

27.

Another component of the SMS was ‘Release Introduction’. Initially, this service
was carried out in accordance with the CCD entitled “Pathway Release Policy”
(‘Release Policy”) (see, for example, FSL_04/26 and FSL_04/27).

A release is “a documented collection of software and/or data provided by Fujitsu

to deliver a service”. During the Legacy Horizon and HNG-X periods, releases

Page 10 of 193
28.

29.

30.

FUJ00126035

FUJ00126035

were classified as either software releases or reference data releases, and
supported changes of POL’s service delivery in order to implement a business
change (FSL_04/26).
Releases were subject to change control procedures described in the Codified
Agreement (see, for example, FSL_04/25). The change control procedures also
contained ‘emergency procedures’, which allowed Fujitsu to proceed with any
change it considered necessary for it to comply with its contractual obligations if
there was insufficient time to comply with standard procedures, provided Fujitsu
gave POL a CCN for retrospective change as soon as practicable (FSL_04/26).
Separately, the Release Policy made provision for ‘maintenance releases’, which
were a type of software release. Maintenance releases were releases of new
software and data to remove faults or to improve service levels without changing
business functionality or business data. From July 1999, the Release Policy
described three categories of maintenance releases:

a. Performance / capacity improvements, where a CCN was required;

b. Scheduled releases containing fault fixes and small functional

changes, where a CCN was required; and

c. Urgent fault fixes, where no CCN was required.
Maintenance releases ranged in scope from minor releases to major releases.
Minor maintenance releases were solely concerned with rectifying faults reported
to Fujitsu through “the incident and problem management processes that
resulted in no associated changes to designed system functionality, process,
procedure, training or documentation”. Such releases were to be applied to the
system as soon as they were authorised by Fujitsu, and POL was to be notified

by entries made in the ‘Online Problem Management Database’. Such releases

Page 11 of 193
31.

32.

FUJ00126035

FUJ00126035

were also notified during Service Management Forum meetings and documented
in the Service Review Book (FSL_04/26).

The procedures for authorising changes to Horizon’s live estate were described
in the CS Support Services Operations Manual (FSL_04/28). The procedures
included a weekly Release Management Forum to decide which fixes should be
created and to assess the impact of any associated risk (see, for example,
FSL_04/28).

The Release Policy was changed over time, including changes to the definitions
of releases, and the teams and processes relating to the authorisation of

releases, which are set out in FSL_04/27.

Management of problems and complaints

33.

Fujitsu was to provide a single point of contact for any operational or service-
related issues and had overall responsibility for the integrity of the problem and
complaint management process, and liaison with POL and individual service

managers who managed individual problems (FSL_04/21).

Measurement and management of customer satisfaction

34.

Fujitsu and POL were to measure satisfaction at regular intervals using a
scorecard system. Fujitsu was also to report on progress against any service

improvement plans within the Service Review Book (FSL_04/21).

HNG-X

35.

36.

Generally, the SMS continued to perform the same functions and responsibilities
after HNG-X was introduced in 2010 (FSL_04/29).

In August 2014, after Fujitsu’s first line support function was transferred to Atos
as part of POL’s towers strategy, the Major Account Controllers team (“MAC

Team”) was added to the SMS. The MAC Team's responsibilities included, (i)

Page 12 of 193
FUJ00126035

FUJ00126035

providing a single point of contact for Atos enquiries and escalations, (ii) being a
resolution contact point for branch logged software incidents and customer

complaint handling, and (iii) trend reporting (FSL_04/30).

Service Desk Service

37.

38.

The Service Desk, which was also known at various times as the Horizon
Systems Helpdesk (HSH) or Horizon Service Desk (HSD), provided first line
support to Post Office branches and other designated groups through the
provision of a support desk function, which included end to end incident
management (FSL_04/31 to FSL_04/33). Postmasters reporting issues with
Horizon counter equipment or software contacted the Service Desk and an
incident would be logged (FSL_04/31 to FSL_04/33). The Service Desk acted as
an initiator within the problem management process due to its ability to monitor
incident trends against the severity received (FSL_04/33).
The Service Desk resolved calls relating to various types of incidents, including
those concerning counter hardware, software and network issues. Further detail
in relation to the service provided by the Service Desk is set out in the following
documents:

a. Before December 2002: the POCL Infrastructure Service Definition

(see, for example, FSL_04/31);

b. From December 2002 to October 2006: the Service Description for

the Horizon Systems Helpdesk (FSL_04/32); and

c. From October 2006 to June 2014: the “Service Desk Joint Working
Document” (“Working Document”) (see, for example, FSL_04/34)

(FSL_04/35).

Page 13 of 193
39.

40.

FUJ00126035

FUJ00126035

In late 2002 to early 2003, the Network Business Support Centre (the “NBSC”)
took over responsibility from the Service Desk for calls requiring advice or
guidance in the Horizon system, and from November to December 2002, the
Fujitsu Service Desk only handled Horizon system-related incidents (for
example, incidents relating to hardware or software) (FSL_04/36). In 2014, as
noted above, Fujitsu’s first line support function was transferred to Atos
(FSL_04/37).

During the time it was in place, the Service Desk managed the resolution of
incidents using processes defined in the relevant incident management process

(see, for example, FSL_04/3 and FSL_04/38).

Accessing the Service Desk

41.

42.

To access the Service Desk in the period September 1996 to approximately
September 2001, branches used a direct telephone number. There was a
separate telephone number for contacting POL (FSL_04/36 and FSL_04/39).
From around September 2001 onwards, branches contacted the Service Desk
by telephoning a ‘Single Point of Contact’ telephone number and following the
interactive voice recording to select the Service Desk (FSL_04/31 to FSL_04/33).
This telephone number was managed and controlled by POL.

If the Service Desk was contacted, a Service Desk agent would answer the call,
obtain details from the caller concerning the reported issues and record these
details (including the call classification or ‘call type’ and severity) (FSL_04/31 to
FSL_04/33). The Service Desk agent would then refer to the knowledge-base
and undertake basic diagnostics in an effort to resolve the incident. If resolved,

the Service Desk agent would ‘close’ the incident with the agreement of the

Page 14 of 193
FUJ00126035

FUJ00126035

caller. If the fault remained unresolved at the end of the call, the Service Desk

agent would escalate the incident (FSL_04/31 to FSL_04/33).

43. The Service Desk’s hours of operation changed over time:

a.

Before December 2002: the Service Desk was to be provided from
8.00am to 8.00pm Monday to Saturday, excluding Bank Holidays and
Christmas Day. A ‘skeleton’ Service Desk was also to be provided
between 5.00am and 8.00am and between 8.00pm and 12.00am
Monday to Saturday, and between 7.00am and 10.00pm on Sundays
excluding Christmas Day (FSL_04/25);

From December 2002 to October 2008: the Service Desk was

available from 8.00am to 6.30pm Monday to Saturday excluding
Christmas Day (FSL_04/32);

From October 2008 to April 2013: the Service Desk was available from

8.00am to 6.00pm Monday to Friday, and 8.00am to 2.00pm on
Saturday excluding Christmas Day (FSL_04/40); and

From April 2013 to June 2014: the Service Desk was available from

7.00am to 11.00pm Monday to Friday, 8.00am to 11.00pm on
Saturday, and 8.00am to 5.00pm on Sunday and Bank Holidays

excluding Christmas Day (FSL_04/33 and FSL_04/41).

44. Outside of these hours, the Service Desk provided a voicemail service. Any

voicemail messages left by branches were to be retrieved and processed by the

Service Desk from 8.00am on the following working day (FSL_04/32 and

FSL_04/33).

Page 15 of 193
FUJ00126035

FUJ00126035

The Wednesday Peak

45.

The issue of the ‘Wednesday Peak’ was referred to in the First Corporate
Statement at paragraph 144. Monthly Progress Reports for May 1999
(FSL_04/42) and June 1999 (FSL_04/43) noted that Customer Satisfaction was
low due to the responsiveness of the Service Desk to the Wednesday Peak. As
a result, support on Wednesdays and Thursdays was increased by introducing
an ‘expert domains’ function on the Service Desk staffed by Fujitsu, Peritas
Limited (“Peritas”) and POL employees (further detail in relation to the role of

Peritas is set out in the Training section below).

Training to the Service Desk

46.

47.

48.

Service Desk staff were to be trained in the use of the Horizon system
(FSL_04/44). According to the 1997 Horizon Systems Helpdesk Operations
Manual, training plans would be created and maintained for Service Desk staff.
It was the responsibility of the HSH Manager to design and implement a suitable
induction and training programme for new staff joining the Service Desk
(FSL_04/45). Fujitsu has identified various Service Desk newsletters which
referred to training opportunities for Service Desk staff (see, for example,
FSL_04/46 and FSL_04/47).

Performance was managed and monitored through SLTs, which included the
time taken to answer and resolve certain types of call and the retrieval of
voicemail messages (FSL_04/32).

From October 2006 to June 2014, performance was managed through both SLTs
and Operational Level Targets (“OLTs”), which included the Service Desk’s
response time to customer complaints (FSL_04/33). OLTs only applied within the

hours of 9.00am to 5.30pm Monday to Friday excluding Bank Holidays

Page 16 of 193
49.

FUJ00126035

FUJ00126035

(FSL_04/33 and FSL_04/35). The Service Desk was to use reasonable
endeavours to supply daily performance statistics by midday on the next working
day (FSL_04/33).

During the same period, Fujitsu was to monitor the quality of the Service Desk to
ensure it met POL’s specifications as documented within the Working Document
(FSL_04/34). The monitoring could include recording calls, where reasonably
practicable, for the purposes of monitoring call control, customer satisfaction,
knowledge and system use. POL was to agree the method and timescale with

Fujitsu, and POL reserved the right to audit the quality scoring.

Systems Management Service

Legacy Horizon

50.

51.

52.

The Systems Management Service was provided by the SMC. The Service
Descriptions for the Systems Management Service in the context of Legacy
Horizon were initially set out in the Codified Agreement (see, for example,
FSL_04/31) and later in a Service Description dated 18 December 2002
(FSL_04/48), which was withdrawn in January 2010 (FSL_04/49). Before the
withdrawal, the primary elements of the service were:

a. anevent management service; and

b. a software distribution service, allowing new and updated software to

be deployed and remotely installed across the network.

The Service Description explains events as “indications of conditions that have
operational significance. They include software, hardware or security conditions
that may require investigation and also include occurrences of events such as
low battery in PIN Pads.”

In addition to these services, the Systems Management Service included:

Page 17 of 193
53.

54.

55.

FUJ00126035

FUJ00126035

a. Software repository management;

b. Asset management, including maintenance of an asset register;

c. Configuration management;

d. Support for other services, including the Engineer Service;

e. Business continuity testing; and

f. | Atime synchronisation service.
The Systems Management Service was for Fujitsu’s internal use only and was
available 24 hours a day, every day of the year.
SMC staff were to be “appropriately trained”. It was the responsibility of the SMC
Team Leader to ensure training plans were created and maintained for each
member of staff and that “the required training outlined in their individual plans”
was received (FSL_04/50).
Examples of the types of training that SMC teams would attend can be found at
FSL_04/51 and FSL_04/52. In November 2002, a review of the SMC Training
Strategy highlighted improvements to be made going forward, based on

feedback from SMC staff (FSL_04/53 and FSL_04/54).

HNG-X

56.

57.

Like the Systems Management Service in Legacy Horizon, the primary services
for HNG-X also comprised an event management service and a software
distribution service. The Systems Management Service also provided a system
monitoring service (FSL_04/55 to FSL_04/60).

The relevant Service Descriptions noted that the SMC was a first line support
team that also had responsibilities to provide certain second line support

functions (FSL_04/5).

Page 18 of 193
FUJ00126035
FUJ00126035

58. Although the event management and software distribution services remained
broadly the same, the Service Descriptions provided that all new platforms in
HNG-X would have the appropriate level of performance monitoring software
installed.

59. Once a system or network condition had been identified, the Systems
Management Service was expected to raise an appropriate incident either via
the Service Desk or through Fujitsu’s incident management systems. The
Systems Management Service would also provide service reporting for
distribution to POL.

60. From April 2014, activity relating to POL systems Credence and POLSAP were
excluded from the Systems Management Service and moved to separate
services (FSL_04/58).

61. Similarly to Legacy Horizon, the Systems Management Service for HNG-X was
for Fujitsu’s internal use only and was available 24 hours a day, every day of the
year.

Reconciliation Service

62. The Inquiry has asked Fujitsu to provide information in relation to the “Business
Support Section” and the Management Support Unit (“MSU”). Fujitsu has been
unable to identify documents relating to a Business Support Section; however,
Fujitsu has identified documents relating to the Business Support Unit. Details in
relation to the Business Support Unit (“BSU”) are set out below.

Legacy Horizon

63. The BSU Incident Reconciliation Procedures for Release NR2 dated November
1998 explain that the BSU was responsible for ensuring that all APS transactions

which occurred at a branch counter reached the intended clients (for example,

Page 19 of 193
64.

65.

66.

67.

FUJ00126035

FUJ00126035

that payment of a customer's gas bill reached the system of the relevant energy
company) (FSL_04/61). The procedures explain that details of these transactions
had to pass through a number of system boundaries which may have caused
rejections (or non-deliveries) and it was the BSU that would progress those
transactions. At that time, the BSU was then said to have generated various
reconciliation reports, some of which were internal and some of which were
provided to POL.

The APS Reconciliation Report Delivery Process from August 1999 then explains
that the BSU was disbanded following the withdrawal of the Benefits Agency from
the Pathway Project and the MSU was formed (FSL_04/62).

Since at least September 1999, the MSU has supported operation in areas
including:

a. Management information systems;

b. Information technology equipment;

c. EPOSS and APS transaction reconciliation, including working with the
Customer Service Problem Manager to resolve reconciliation
problems; and

d. Performance benchmarking.

Further detail in relation to the role of the MSU in the context of Legacy Horizon
is set out in the Customer Services Infrastructure Operations Manual (FSL_04/63
and FSL_04/64).

Both the BSU and MSU formed part of Fujitsu’s Reconciliation Service during the
time of Legacy Horizon. With the introduction of Network Banking, Fujitsu

understands that reconciliation occurred at two levels:

Page 20 of 193
68.

FUJ00126035

FUJ00126035

a. The counter reconciling with the “client” (in the context of Network
Banking, this would have been the bank to which payment is being
made); and

b. The counter reconciling with POL’s own central systems,

(see, for example, FSL_04/65 to FSL_04/67).
During this time, the Reconciliation Service generated and circulated a number
of reconciliation reports, including those described in the following documents:

a. TPS Reconciliation and Incident Management Procedures dating from
December 2002 to October 2005 (FSL_04/68 to FSL_04/71); and

b. Network Banking Reconciliation and Incident Management
Procedures, as referenced above, was amended in May 2005 to
capture all “On Line Services”. At the time, these services included
banking transactions, debit and credit card transactions and electronic

top-up transactions (FSL_04/72).

HNG-X

69.

70.

The Reconciliation Service continued during HNG-X. Examples of Service
Descriptions during this time are at FSL_04/73 to FSL_04/76.

Fujitsu understands that a number of reports were given to POL containing
statements of reconciliation across agreed boundary points. Details of these
reports are set out in the End-to-End Reconciliation Reporting Service
Description (FSL_04/77 to FSL_04/80). Transactions that Fujitsu could not
reconcile were referred to as “Exceptions”, which were also to be identified and
reported to POL, and addressed by the Reconciliation Service (see
Reconciliation and Incident Management, Joint Working Document: FSL_04/81

and FSL_04/82).

Page 21 of 193
71.

72.

FUJ00126035

FUJ00126035

The Reconciliation Service was available 9.00am to 5.30pm Mondays to Fridays,
excluding Bank Holidays. Although it is noted that the process of reconciliation is
provided on an on-going and automated basis.

SLTs and OLTs for the Reconciliation Service are set out in the Service

Descriptions.

Business and System Incidents

73.

74.

75.

In the context of reconciliation and incident management, a ‘Business Incident’
is defined in the relevant Service Descriptions as a “‘symptom’ of an underlying
cause — e.g., the effect of the system fault on the resulting reconciliation or
settlement information sent to Post Office.” A ‘System Incident’ is then defined
as the underlying ‘cause’ of a Business Incident.
Business Incidents could be raised by:

a. The Fujitsu Reconciliation Service;

b. POL; or

c. The Third Line Support Service (as discussed in more detail below).
Business Incident Management System (“BIMS”) reports were raised to log
Business Incidents. A BIMS report was designed to report the progress of a

Business Incident to resolution.

Third Line Software Support Service

76.

The Third Line Software Support Service provided third line application support
functions and technical support. From the time of the Initial Go Live of Legacy
Horizon, this role was undertaken by the European Development and Support
Centre ("EDSC") (FSL_04/83). The service was later delivered by the SSC
(FSL_04/5).

Page 22 of 193
FUJ00126035
FUJ00126035

77. The technical support provided by the Third Line Support Service included
(FSL_04/84 and FSL_04/85):

a. Investigating and resolving new software incidents within the POL
branch infrastructure escalated from the Service Desk or SMC. It
provided software fixes, as required, to branches, counters and/or
data centres. Ownership and management of the incident remained
with the Service Desk that logged the incident;

b. Producing and authorising workarounds and updates to entries within
the KEL database; and

c. Receiving solutions developed by the Application Support Service to
resolve incidents.

78. According to an Operational Level Agreement dated June 2003, one of the roles
of the SSC was to hold “workshops and skills transfer sessions relating to
technical aspects of the Pathway solution and diagnostic techniques” for Service
Desk staff (FSL_04/86). For examples of these sessions, see FSL_04/87 and
FSL_04/88.

79. The Third Line Support Service was intended to be for Fujitsu's internal use and
was not generally directly available to POL or postmasters. It was available 24
hours per day but provided only on an on-call basis outside of 9.00am to 5.30pm
Monday to Friday and Bank Holidays (FSL_04/84 and FSL_04/85).

Application Support Service (Fourth Line Support)

80. Prior to August 2006 and in relation to Legacy Horizon, the Incident Management
Processes (see, for example, FSL_04/2) and “End to End Application Support

Strategy” set out the role of fourth line support (see, for example, FSL_04/4).

Page 23 of 193
81.

82.

83.

84.

85.

FUJ00126035

FUJ00126035

In relation to HNG-X, the service description for the Application Support Service,
or Fourth Line Support Service, (the “Application Support Service’) was initially
produced in August 2006 (FSL_04/89), and included the following areas of
support:
a. Application support in the context of software fixes; and
b. | The investigation and resolution of new software incidents which could
not otherwise be resolved by the Third Line Support Service.
The Application Support Service was delivered by Fujitsu’s Application Division
teams and, later, by certain overseas teams (FSL_04/5, FSL_04/90 and
FSL_04/91).
From at least October 2010, the Application Support Service also provided
support in respect of the POLSAP application, details of which were set out in
the POLSAP Hosting Service: Joint Working Document (FSL_04/92 to
FSL_04/94)
The “Operational Level Agreement for 4'" Line Support of HNGX” (FSL_04/95
and FSL_04/96) describes the obligations of the Application Support Service and
the Third Line Support Service. These obligations include (but are not limited to)
the Third Line Support Service ensuring:
a. All calls passed to the Application Support Service are logged in the
call management system (Peak);
b. All problems where a resolution is already known by the support
community are filtered out; and
c. Calls are escalated in a timely manner.
Obligations owed by the Application Support Service to the Third Line Support

Service include ensuring that resolution information recorded in the relevant

Page 24 of 193
86.

87.

88.

89.

90.

FUJ00126035

FUJ00126035

systems and that information and training relating to new releases is provided
(FSL_04/86).
If the Application Support Service determined that a software incident resulted
from a “known error”, this was to be communicated to the Third Line Support
Service. The relevant KEL record would then be identified and updated
appropriately, and information would be disseminated to the Service Desk for
use in relation to other similar incidents.
The Application Support Service also provided support by ensuring that Fujitsu's
Third Line Support Service was made aware of the symptoms that generated the
incident and would document that information so that it could also be made
available to both the Service Desk and the Systems Management Service. Any
resolutions or workarounds that were returned to the Third Line Support Service
would have been tested and authorised in accordance with the agreed release
authorisation process (FSL_04/97).
In addition to incident resolution, the Application Support Service also provided
the Third Line Support Service with documentation relating to new Releases so
that the Third Line Support Service could become familiar with any new products
or services before they were released in the live environment.
From September 2013, the Application Support Service was also required to
undertake the following on an annual basis (FSL_04/98):

a. Deliver secure coding training;

b. | Maintain the secure guidelines; and

c. Maintain the secure coding template.

There were no specific SLTs that applied to the service (FSL_04/89).

Engineering Service

91.

92.

93.

94.

95.

The Engineer or Engineering Service (“Engineering Service”) comprised an on-
site replacement or repair service, for Horizon equipment at Post Office branches
and other designated locations, together with associated support and
administrative functions (for example, training centres and the NBSC)
(FSL_04/99 and FSL_04/100). Associated support and administrative functions
included tracking hardware assets, Local Area Network (“LAN”) support and
Portable Appliance Testing (“PAT”) (FSL_04/99 and FSL_04/100).

The Engineering Service was provided by support engineers, who were Fujitsu
employees or third-party subcontractors appointed by Fujitsu (“Support
Engineers”) (FSL_04/99 and FSL_04/100).

To access the on-site replacement or repair service, Post Office branches would
report equipment and hardware faults to the Service Desk. Initially the Service
Desk would attempt to diagnose and resolve the reported faults. If the fault could
not be resolved and service restored to the branch, the Service Desk would
arrange a Support Engineer to attend the branch to resolve the issue (FSL_04/99
and FSL_04/100).

Originally, the Engineering Service was available from 8.00am to 6.30pm
Monday to Friday excluding all Bank Holidays (FSL_04/99). Then from
approximately August 2013, the Engineering Service was available from 8.00am
to 8.00pm Monday to Friday, and 8.00am to 5.00pm on Saturdays excluding all
Bank Holidays (FSL_04/99 and FSL_04/100).

The associated support and administrative functions noted above were provided
by Fujitsu to Post Office branches and POL on an ongoing basis (FSL_04/99 and

FSL_04/100).

Page 26 of 193
FUJ00126035
FUJ00126035

96. The Engineering Service was primarily responsible for SLTs which related to the
level of service that POL required from Fujitsu (FSL_04/99 and FSL_04/100).
The primary SLT for the Engineering Service concerned the time taken to resolve
incidents (FSL_04/100).

Management Information Service

97. The primary aim of the Management Information Service (“MIS”) was to provide
POL with performance reporting and management information relating to Horizon
services (FSL_04/101).

Legacy Horizon

98. The requirement for a MIS service was initially set out in Schedule E01 of the
Codified Agreement (FSL_04/25). According to the MIS Service Description
dated 20 December 2002 (FSL_04/101), during Legacy Horizon, the main
elements of the MIS were to deliver to POL:

a. The monthly Service Review Book, which contained various
information including a management summary of highlights from the
previous month's service delivery, a high-level review of each supplied
service, service volumetric data, and a high-level review of problem
management and cross domain problem statuses (amongst other
things);

b. Management information, including Network Banking management
information, Order Book Control Service and Automated Payment
Service client transaction management information, and capacity
management information;

c. Support on Miscellaneous Data Queries from POL; and

Page 27 of 193
FUJ00126035

FUJ00126035

d. Support in relation to the calculation of liquidated damages that may
have been owed to POL from Fujitsu as a result of not achieving

particular service levels under service level agreements.

HNG-X

99.

The MIS continued following the introduction of HNG-X (see, for example,
(FSL_04/102), with certain changes, including (i) the delivery of a monthly
Summary Service Overview until around November 2013, and (ii) a Transaction

Time Benchmarking Service.

Additional Support Functions

100. In addition to the services described above, the Inquiry has also asked that

Fujitsu provide some further information in relation to a number of other roles,
fora and teams. To the extent these additional support functions are not

addressed above, explanations are set out below.

Customer Service Problem Manager / Problem Manager

101. The role of Problem Manager was introduced in at least May 1998 to manage

and co-ordinate the resolution of problems (FSL_04/103) by allocating to the
individual most capable of handling the particular problem raised. Where
appropriate, the role was to be performed by the service manager of the relevant
service. For example, for at least the period 1998 to 2002, where financial
reconciliation exceptions occurred more than once, a “Problem Incident” was
reported to a Customer Service Problem Manager after the relevant support unit
had dealt with the financial reconciliation itself. Details in relation to the resolution
of financial reconciliation problems during this time are set out in the “Customer
Services Infrastructure Services Operations Manual” (see, for example,

FSL_04/63, FSL_04/64, FSL_04/104 and FSL_04/105).

Page 28 of 193
102.

103.

104.

FUJ00126035

FUJ00126035

The duties of the Problem Manager included developing a resolution plan,
logging the problem on the problem database and keeping the database (and
any parties involved in the resolution plan) updated, monitoring progress and
then closing problems once all relevant parties agreed that the problem has been
resolved.

Problem Managers were a means of liaison between the Service Management
teams of Fujitsu and POL, and different processes and procedures were followed
depending on the nature and impact of the problem (FSL_04/106).

Further detail in relation to the role of Problem Managers and the procedures
followed are set out in the “Customer Service Problem Management Process”

exhibited to this statement (FSL_04/107 to FSL_04/115).

Field Service Management

105.

106.

Fujitsu’s Field Service Management (“FSM”) team was operational during the
Legacy Horizon period following the national rollout. Based on a draft “ICL
Pathway Field Service Manager — Role Definition and Overview” dated 13
September 2000, the role of the FSM team was intended to encompass both
Problem Management and participation in the Management Care Visit
Programme. The FSM team was intended to be responsible for the proactive
identification and management of system problems that affected individual Post
Office branches. Root causes to problems were to be identified, and mitigating
actions applied (FSL_04/116). An example of a RAR for a Field Service Manager
role is at FSL_04/117.

The FSM team was field-based and spread geographically across the UK. Each
Field Service Manager was responsible for an area of the UK. The role operated

within the overall framework of the Customer Service Problem Management

Page 29 of 193
Process,

FUJ00126035

FUJ00126035

the End-to End Customer Complaint Process, and the ICL

Pathway/POCL Problem Management Interface Agreement (FSL_04/116).

107. In relation to Problem Management, the FSM had responsibility for:

a.

Identification of “Problem Offices”: The FSM team was to proactively
seek to identify offices displaying indications of Fujitsu related
problems, through reference to various sources of information
(FSL_04/116). These sources included: (i) an analysis of HSH call
logs on a weekly or monthly basis, (ii) appointment as a Problem
Manager within the Customer Services team, or (iii) referral of site-
specific complaints by the Customer Services Strategic Services team
under the End-to-End Customer Complaint Process (FSL_04/116).

Communication of Problem Offices to Post Office Network (“PON”)

Business Service Management (“BSM”): Each week, the FSM team

was intended to pass to the PON BSM a consolidated list of branches
which had been identified as having potential problems, and which a
Field Service Manager would wish to visit in order to assist with
assessing the problem and identifying the appropriate course of
action. PON BSM would then, following certain internal POL
processes, contact the relevant outlets and advise them that an ICL
Pathway Field Service Manager would be contacting them to arrange
a visit (FSL_04/116).

Visits to branches: During a branch visit, the Field Service Manager
was to, amongst other things, seek to identify any potential external
influences that could give rise to the system problems, and gather all

information relating to the circumstances under which the problems

Page 30 of 193
FUJ00126035

FUJ00126035

arise (FSL_04/116). Following the site visit, the FSM would produce
an Action Plan to progress any Fujitsu related issues. Details of this
action plan would be entered on the Problem Management Database
and updated as resolution is progressed (FSL_04/116).

108. It was intended that the FSM team would participate in the Management Care
Visit Programme (FSL_04/116). Further details of the Management Care Visit
Programme are provided below.

109. As noted above, the FSM team interacted with other ICL Pathway teams and
processes in discharging their role. These interactions are set out
diagrammatically in (FSL_04/118).

Client Interface Management

110. The Client Interface Management was a unit responsible for the introduction and
ongoing management of services relating to client interfaces, such as HAPS,
APS clients, LFS and TIP. Further details of this unit are contained in the
Operations Manuals for the Customer Services Directorate dating from
November 2001 to May 2002 (FSL_04/23, FSL_04/24 and FSL_04/119).

Operations Service Unit

111. From at least January 2001, the Operations Services Unit was responsible for
the following tasks, amongst others:

a. Providing a Duty Manager who was the single point of contact for live
service issues, 7 days a week, 24 hours a day;

b. Problem management, which entailed unit staff taking on the role of
problem manager where appropriate;

c. Business continuity services;

Page 31 of 193
FUJ00126035
FUJ00126035

d. Supplier management, specifically monitoring and reviewing supplier
and service performance on a daily, weekly and monthly basis;

e. Change management;

f. Operations support, which provided administrative support for the
Change, Duty and Problem Management processes;

g. Reference data management (which appears to have ceased in
November 2001); and

h. Application service management (which appears to have ceased in
November 2001).

(see “CS Operations Services Operations Manual” dated 24 January 2001:

FSL_04/23 and FSL_04/120)

112. Subsequently, Operations Support became responsible for managing other
services including the non-polling report (including analysing and investigating
non-polling incidents), managing electronic signatures for operational system
changes and managing security passes for Fujitsu staff visiting Post Office
branches (FSL_04/23).

Strategic Services Unit

113. Further details of the Strategic Services Unit (“SSU”) are set out in the Customer
Service Infrastructure Services Operations Manual. This provided, amongst
other things, that the SSU was responsible for ensuring that Horizon systems
being operated within Post Office branches were properly implemented and
remained useable for the postmaster (and NBSC) when conducting everyday
business. It was also responsible for ensuring a high level of customer
satisfaction (FSL_04/105). The SSU also had responsibility for processes,

including in relation to customer satisfaction and managing monitored feedback

Page 32 of 193
FUJ00126035
FUJ00126035

on service delivery from the Service Visit Reply (or “SVR”) process (FSL_04/23).
The SSU would review feedback on Reply Cards left at the Post Office branch
following an engineer's visit that allowed a postmaster to comment on the quality
of the service provided by the engineer during their visit, and on the service
provided by the Service Desk.

Outlet Business Change Team

114. During the Legacy Horizon and HNG-X periods, the Outlet Business Change
(later known as Operational Business Change) (“OBC”) service, supported
operational business changes within the POL’s branch network (see, for
example, FSL_04/121 and FSL_04/122).

115. The service was primarily concerned with delivering physical and configuration
changes to the Horizon counter at Post Office branches when requested by POL,
including the following:

a. _ the supply of Horizon equipment;

b. the installation and removal of Horizon equipment (for example,
branch counters/terminals); and

c. moving Horizon equipment within and between outlets.

116. The OBC service was delivered by the OBC team, and the service was provided
in planned, unplanned or emergency circumstances, including the opening or
closure of a Post Office branch (FSL_04/24, FSL_04/121 and FSL_04/122).

117. To access the service, POL would submit a change order to Fujitsu (also known
as an OBC Branch Change work order request). The performance of the OBC

service was measured against SLTs and OLTs.

TRAINING

118.

119.

Fujitsu has been asked by the Inquiry to provide details relating to the training
programme that was offered in respect of the Horizon system to non-ICL
Pathway/Fujitsu employees.

As set out in more detail below, most, if not all, of the training provided to
postmasters by Fujitsu took place before and during the national rollout, when
the Fujitsu entity responsible for management of the Horizon contract was ICL
Pathway. Accordingly, in this section of the corporate statement, references to
both ICL Pathway and Fujitsu shall be used to reflect which entity was

responsible for management of the Horizon contract at the relevant time.

Training Programme Requirements

120.

121.

ICL Pathway’s proposed approach to the training programme for the
implementation of the Horizon system was initially submitted as part of the
contractual solution during the tender process for the Pathway Programme.

The provision of training was included in the services to be provided by ICL
Pathway under the Related Agreements in 1996. The contractual requirements
for the training programme were later set out in the Codified Agreement.
Requirements 531-534 and Requirement 915 of Schedule A15 of the Codified
Agreement stipulated that:

a. by Requirement 531, training was to be provided “to enable POCL’s
target audience to achieve acceptable standards in key competencies
as defined by POCL”. The ‘target audience’ included counter users,
managers, trainers, auditors and certain non-user groups, “i.e. retail
network managers, regional helpline staff, and account teams in

business centres’;

Page 34 of 193
FUJ00126035

FUJ00126035

b. by Requirement 534, training was to take account of users’ experience
of automated products and their differing abilities to learn. The training
requirements for different groups was to be agreed between ICL

Pathway and POL; and

c. by Requirement 915, training should “enable POCL’s staff or Agents to
achieve acceptable standards in key competencies in the use of the
POCL Services” and “incorporate the development design and delivery

of agreed training events and support materials”.

122. The key measurables of the training service set out in Requirement 915 included

that:

a. “training shall not be delivered more than five (5) POCL Core Days

before” the Horizon system went ‘live’ in the relevant branch;

b. “training shall have received a positive rating of not less than 95% as a

result of a training measurement questionnaire”;

c. the training services should “ensure that 95% of trainees on completion
of the training shall be able to demonstrate achievement of the agreed
level of competence, which shall reflect a score of 90% for knowledge

related areas for transactions and the operating platform’; and

d. competence levels “shall be measured...to second level of the
Kirkpatrick model’. Fujitsu understands the Kirkpatrick model is a
globally recognised method of evaluating the results of training and

learning programs.

123. By Reference 915 of Schedule A16 of the Codified Agreement:

Page 35 of 193
FUJ00126035
FUJ00126035

a. ICL Pathway was to provide a maximum of 12,600 training courses,
broken down into 5,504 Counter Assistants Courses lasting one day (the
“Counter Assistants Course”), 7,004 Managers Courses lasting one
and a half days (the “Counter Managers Course”), 25 ‘Train the Trainer’
courses, 34 Auditor courses and 33 POL helpline courses. The intended
audience and specification for these courses is set out in more detail

below.

b. Following national rollout “all outstanding or ongoing training will be the
responsibility of POCL”, including update training for new software
releases or the training of new staff, unless ICL Pathway agreed to
provide additional counter staff training (which would be charged in
accordance with the rate card in paragraph 8.3 of Schedule A12 of the
Codified Agreement). User training services provided by Fujitsu were no
longer a requirement from the date of the Varied and Restated Codified

Agreement in 2002.

124. Responsibility for planning, developing, delivering, and assessing training and
education in relation to the rollout of the Horizon system was sub-contracted by
ICL Pathway to Peritas, a subsidiary of ICL PLC, under the terms of a Purchase
Agreement dated 26 July 1996 (the “Peritas Purchase Agreement’). According
to publicly available information, the principal business activity of Peritas was the
provision of training and related services. Peritas was awarded the National
Training Award in 1997 and the IT Training Company of the Year Award between
1994 and 1997. Peritas changed its name to ICL Training Services Limited in

1998 and to KnowledgePool Limited (“KnowledgePool’”) in 1999.

Page 36 of 193
125.

126.

FUJ00126035

FUJ00126035

Peritas’ training specifications with respect to the Horizon system were set out in
Appendix 1 to the Peritas Purchase Agreement. This required Peritas staff to
undergo a ‘gear up’ before delivering training events, which would “verify their
capabilities”, train them in POL “culture, policy, procedures” and “establish the
capability’ to deliver the relevant training event (FSL_04/123). Peritas was also
required to ensure the effectiveness of the training programme was consistent
with the Kirkpatrick model. The processes for doing so were set out in a Training
Evaluation Paper and included (i) obtaining user feedback on the course, and (ii)
testing user competence on using the system (FSL_04/124).

Further detail on the specific role of Peritas in relation to the implementation of

the Horizon system is set out below.

Development of the Training Specification

127.

128.

According to Change Proposal 1294 (which was raised in June 1998), the original
training programme under the Related Agreements was based upon ICL
Pathway providing a 4-hour classroom-based training event, with subsequent
exercises using workbooks in branches. This was to be followed by an “after care
visit’ to the branch to conduct a competency test. The amendments proposed in
Change Proposal 1294 included, (i) removing the requirement for the
competency test to be carried out during the aftercare visit, as it would instead
be conducted during the appropriate training event, and (ii) the aftercare visit
would be timed to coincide with the installation / go live dates for each branch
(FSL_04/125).

Release 1A was rolled out in the Stroud area in September and October 1996.
Given the limited functionality of Release 1A, the scale of the training provided

was smaller than that required for later releases. A two-hour workshop was held

Page 37 of 193
129.

FUJ00126035

FUJ00126035

with staff which was timed to coincide with installation of the equipment.
Exercises, workbooks and quick reference guides were also provided
(FSL_04/126). A Lessons Learned report prepared by ICL Pathway in relation to
the Initial Go Live (“IGL”) phase contained a summary taken from a report on the
IGL training provided in Stroud. Feedback in the Lessons Learned report
included that the “training and training documentation worked very well for the
post masters’, the use of workbook exercises were “essential for user's
confidence”, trainers needed a “comprehensive understanding” of POL
procedures, and in-branch training “is not ideal, and if used, time needs to be
added to take account of the distractions and interruptions” (FSL_04/127).
The process to achieve development, delivery and sign off for training material
for Release 1C onwards was set out in a “Training development & sign off
document’, as follows:
a. Training Needs Analysis: This involved identifying the business needs to
be achieved, setting business objectives, and drafting course

specifications and performance indicators.

b. Training Plans: Peritas was required to produce, (i) a Draft Programme
Development Plan mapping out the specification, development schedule
and allocation of resources, (ii) a Training Plan setting the objectives,
performance standards, proposed media and timings for development of
the course to begin, and (iii) a Training Programme Plan mapping out
the schedule for the entire training programme. These would be
submitted to ICL Pathway for discussion and comment before being

signed off by ICL Pathway.

FUJ00126035

c. Training Course development cycle: This involved the development of

training materials and evaluation sheets. Training modules would be
scripted by Peritas and subject to peer review, using other trainers as
‘students’. When all modules of a training course were in final draft, a
‘dry run’ would be conducted to ICL Pathway staff. Comments from the

dry run were incorporated into the training material.

d. Sign off procedure: The training material to be approved by POL would
be delivered to the model office testing team for comment. A dry run
would then be delivered to POL, ICL Pathway and the Programme
Delivery Authority (the “PDA”). More than one dry run would be delivered
if significant changes were recommended to the course. Once
comments from the dry run had been incorporated, the training event

would be signed off by the PDA and ICL Pathway.

e. Delivery cycle: This included sending invitations to POL staff and

delivering the training course.

f. User Evaluation Procedure: At the end of each training session, an
evaluation form would be completed by each delegate to review the
training received and their confidence in using the system. The
information from these forms was fed into Peritas’ Training Project
Administration system which generated weekly reports of attendance
and satisfaction. These reports would be submitted to ICL Pathway for
monitoring (FSL_04/128). In reviewing its hard copy archives, Fujitsu
has located thousands of these evaluation forms in respect of courses
held in or around the period 2000 and 2001. In the time available, Fujitsu

has scanned and processed a proportional sample of approximately

Page 39 of 193
FUJ00126035

FUJ00126035

15% of the hard copy evaluation forms and submitted these to the Inquiry
(FSL_04/129 to FSL_04/200). Fujitsu has offered to the Inquiry to scan
and process the remaining evaluation forms if it would assist the Inquiry’s

investigations.

130. In line with the above, in March 1997, Peritas produced a “Training Needs

131.

Analysis” document in conjunction with ICL Pathway and POL. The analysis was
the result of research undertaken by Peritas, which included, (i) reviews with
secondees from the Benefits Agency and POL to ICL Pathway, (ii) attendance
by Peritas trainers at a postmaster induction course and a Post Office Cash
Accounting Course, (iii) “detailed reviews” with POL’s National Training
Consultant, (iv) visits to six reference Post Offices in the Swindon area, and (v)
supplementary discussions with postmasters.
Peritas identified the training events required to satisfy the baseline objective of
the training programme, which was stated as being “[t]o ensure that all staff who
work in post offices are competent in the use of the automated platform, are
aware of the impact on operational procedures caused by the introduction of the
platform and that specialist staff are provided with the appropriate additional
information to perform their job role within an automated post office”
(FSL_04/201). The conclusions reached in the Training Needs Analysis included
that:
a. a ‘dedicated classroom event’ had been identified as being the most
efficient process for initial learning. The venue must, however, be readily

accessible (i.e. 15-30 minutes travel); and

Page 40 of 193
FUJ00126035
FUJ00126035

b. computer-based training would provide consolidation and back-up
support. This was to be provided through a Training Mode within the

Horizon system (FSL_04/201).

132. This document also set out the competencies required of different groupings of
staff within POL, which informed the specific training courses intended for those
groupings. Draft course specifications were set out in Appendix D.

133. Broadly, the proposed training programme in the Training Needs Analysis
comprised:

a. the one-and-a-half-day Counter Managers Course, targeted at all

postmasters, identified POL managers, and other staff who were
required to understand the full functionality of the Horizon system,
including balancing reports. According to the draft specification for this
course, the first four modules were dedicated to giving delegates an
overview of the system hardware and desktop menu and taking them
through the transaction screens which would be used to process various
transactions, such as the sale of stock items using various payment
methods, bill payments, DVLA licensing, bank withdrawals and cashing
cheques, and voiding, modifying or reversing transactions. Modules five
to seven would instruct delegates in generating reports and balancing
activities at the end of the business day and, separately, at the end of

the business week;

b. the one-day Counter Assistants Course, targeted at postmaster

assistants and counter assistants (some of whom may attend the
Counter Managers Course instead). The first four modules of this course

mirrored the specification for the Counter Managers Course. Modules

Page 41 of 193
FUJ00126035
FUJ00126035

five and six would instruct delegates on the procedure for balancing an

individual counter position and, briefly, the office balancing process;

c. a two-day course for specialist POL staff, such as auditors, which was

based on the content of the Counter Managers Course but tailored to

meet the needs of the specific teams in question;

d. a five-day ‘Train the Trainer’ course for POL trainers. Further information

in relation to this course is set out below (FSL_04/201).

134. In June 1998, ICL Pathway produced a Training and User Awareness Baseline
Document which set out an updated approach to the training programme. This
reflected the proposed programme in the Training Needs Analysis, as detailed
above. Some aspects of the programme differed from the original programme,
including the following:

a. The User Awareness Event (“UAE”) was no longer mandatory, as initially

proposed;

b. There would be no workbook-based learning during the training events,
but workbook exercises would be provided and recommended for use
in-branch. Examples of the workbooks can be found at (FSL_04/202 and

FSL_04/212);

c. The ‘after care visit’ would not be undertaken by Peritas staff. According
to Change Proposal 1292, this would be the responsibility of Horizon

Field Support Officers (‘HFSOs”) (FSL_04/213); and

d. There would no longer be a specialist training help desk to support

distance learning (FSL_04/214).

137.

FUJ00126035

FUJ00126035

The Training and User Awareness Baseline document also set out details of the
approach to the ‘gear up’ of Peritas trainers, which was to take three weeks. This
included one week’s training to be a postmaster, one week’s training covering
the “training techniques associated with the Horizon programme” and one week’s
training to “deliver and understand the Horizon system/good practice”
(FSL_04/214). The purpose of the ‘gear up’ was to ensure Peritas staff were
“familiar with the functions of both automated and non-automated post offices
and are competent to fulfil their role” (FSL_04/201).

In addition to the training events detailed above, branch managers and
postmasters in affected branches would be invited to attend a Management
Infrastructure Briefing (“MIB”). This was part of the ‘Split Implementation
Programme Strategy’, whereby the rollout of the Horizon system was to be split
into an ‘Infrastructure’ phase and an ‘Installation’ phase. The objectives of the
MIB were to introduce the Horizon system and inform delegates of the reasons
for a change to the business. The event was to be delivered to 50-100 managers
at a time and focussed on informing managers of the reasons for the automation
programme, explaining the overall infrastructure and implementation programme
and informing them of where to gain help and support (FSL_04/215).

Over 200 branches were invited to attend MIB events which took place in May
1998. 100 of these branches were then selected to take part in the Live Trial
(FSL_04/216). The MIB was a key event in the ‘Infrastructure’ phase, as it was
used to inform managers of their role and responsibilities in order to prepare for
the way forward. In order to ensure the MIB contained correct, relevant

information as the training programme adapted throughout rollout, a change

138.

139.

FUJ00126035

FUJ00126035

process was put in place to ensure errors and changes could be actioned quickly
and effectively (FSL_04/217).

During the 12-week ‘Installation’ phase, the UAE would take place, aimed at all
personnel working within or providing support to Post Office branches, to give an
insight into the major changes affecting working practices and the implications of
the implementation of Horizon (FSL_04/215). As with the MIB, to ensure the UAE
was providing correct and relevant information as the rollout programme
progressed and adapted, ICL Pathway put in place a change programme to
ensure changes and errors could be implemented quickly and effectively
(FSL_04/218).

The course specification for the UAE outlined that it was to be delivered in a
venue with a theatre style layout, capable of accommodating up to 100
delegates, and would be presented by a speaker from ICL Pathway supported

by a POL representative (FSL_04/219).

Training Programme - Live Trial

140.

141

142.

The programme of training and awareness events planned for Release 2 and the
Live Trial of Horizon was set out in a Training Strategy document in March 1999
(FSL_04/216).

All branches participating in the Live Trial were encouraged to attend UAEs. This
included the 204 branches which had previously attended UAEs as part of the
training provided in respect of Release 1C. Branches that did not attend a UAE
were provided with a User Awareness Briefing Pack “to ensure that they had the
appropriate information available to them”.

Within the five working days prior to installation of the Horizon system, Counter

Assistants and Counter Managers Courses would take place. Both courses were

Page 44 of 193
143.

FUJ00126035

FUJ00126035

delivered in a classroom environment to a maximum of six attendees at a time,
and delegates were required to pass a competency test (the Performance
Standard Assessment (“PSA”)) on completion. Appendix A to the Training
Strategy Document lists amendments to these courses implemented after
Release 1C (FSL_04/216). The five-day window was later extended to a 10-day
window for some branches (FSL_04/220).

Before a branch could ‘go live’ on the Horizon system, it had to achieve Minimum
Training Compliance (“MTC”). This meant that a sufficient number of staff in each
branch had to be trained to use Horizon under normal circumstances by passing
the competency test. The exact number for each branch was defined by POL
(FSL_04/221). Peritas was required to report to ICL Pathway on competency
levels, including whether delegates passed or failed the competency test
(FSL_04/123). If delegates failed to pass the competency test, they would be

scheduled to attend remedial training and re-take the test.

Training Programme — National Rollout

144.

145.

According to an ICL Pathway Implementation presentation dated February 2001,
the scope of the training programme for national rollout had required 72,000
counter staff to be trained, delivery of nine different types of training course, and
provision of 2,000 standalone training platforms. At its peak, 120 courses were
being delivered each day. The average age of the delegates to be trained was
65, with the eldest being 92 (FSL_04/222).

The training programme for the national rollout was set out in version 11 of the
Training and User Awareness Baseline Document (FSL_04/223). Training during
national rollout was to include the UAE, MIB, a Managers Course and a Counter

Assistants Course. The content, structure and format of these were intended to

Page 45 of 193
146.

FUJ00126035
FUJ00126035

be identical to that provided during the Live Trial (FSL_04/216 and FSL_04/224).
ICL Pathway was required to provide monthly, weekly and daily reports to POL
(via Peritas) containing statistical and management information to measure ICL
Pathway’s compliance with the criteria of Requirement 915. The information to
be included in these reports included the results of the training programme,
trends in feedback, and forecasts of when offices scheduled for installation of the
Horizon system were expected to meet MTC (FSL_04/225).

ICL Pathway would also provide specialist training to groups other than those
working in branches, including:

a. a‘Train the Trainer’ Course lasting five days, aimed at POL trainers who
would be training existing and new staff on using the Horizon system
following its implementation. This course included the content of the UAE
and MIB for information purposes, and would cover delivery of both the
Managers and Counter Assistants courses. Peritas staff would support
the first live training delivered by the newly trained trainer to end-users,
following which the newly trained trainer would be accredited
(FSL_04/216). This accreditation would last to the end of Release NR2.
Trainer upgrade training was available with each new release of Horizon

software (FSL_04/226).

b. Auditors and specialist staff within POL were to be provided with a two-
day course based on the content delivered to branch managers and
tailored to the needs of POL’s national audit team. This course looked at
the use of the Horizon system from an auditor's perspective and
concentrated on possible areas of fraud and how to detect them. By

September 2000, this course was three days in length. The first day

Page 46 of 193
FUJ00126035
FUJ00126035

focussed on the functions and usage of the Horizon system. The second
day focussed on balancing and the suspense account, and the final day
focussed on systems for investigation in a Horizon environment

(FSL_04/227).

c. HFSOs were “resourced from within POCL” and their role was to support
the installation of Horizon by providing onsite support to branches.
HFSOs were to be assigned to a branch on the day of installation and
would remain at the branch for the following two working days to assist
with migration activities and provide support and advice to branch staff.
Training was provided to prepare the HFSO to assist with
implementation before, during and after it took place in branches. The
HFSO course comprised a three-day induction by POL, in addition to the
one-and-a-half-day Counter Managers Course, and a separate five-day
course covering the specific requirements of a HFSO (FSL_04/216). The
second week of the HFSO course focussed on how to migrate Post
Office data into the Horizon system once it had been installed by ICL
Pathway. The HFSO course would be carried out in a training room
environment which was set up to simulate the whole migration process

using multiple training scenarios (FSL_04/228).

147. On 19 May 1999, during the Acceptance process, Acceptance Incident 218 (“Al
218”) was raised because of deficiencies in the accounting modules of the
Counter Managers Training Course, stating that “[t]he Managers Training Course
is not acceptable due to deficiencies in the accounting modules. In the live

environment, the training given did not equip the users to perform the completion

Page 47 of 193
FUJ00126035
FUJ00126035

of office cash accounts. This is a basic POCL function that is central to running
and accounting for the POCL network” (FSL_04/229).

148. Al 218 was categorised as a ‘high’ severity incident. Problems were being
encountered by users when using the stock unit balancing and cash account
parts of the system, which resulted in high volumes of help desk calls and
disruption in branches (FSL_04/226). Reasons for this, as identified by ICL
Pathway, included uncertainty about POL business rules and how to apply them
in the new system (FSL_04/230).

149. In response to the issues raised in Al 218, POL and ICL Pathway agreed to
amend the training courses. CCN 519a was raised on 16 July 1999 to amend the
contractual terms and implement the following changes requested by POL:

a. courses should reflect changes to the balancing process which had been
made since Live Trial, and should have an “increased stress on

balancing elements”;
b. the addition of extra exercises and practice to the Managers Course; and

c. time previously spent on the Counter Assistants Course dealing with the
Benefit Encashment Service (“BES”) should instead be spent on
balancing or, for those who do not preform balancing, on more practice

using the system (FSL_04/231).

150. Suggested course specifications for the amended courses were appended to
Change Proposal 2081 (FSL_04/232).
151. The following steps were then taken by ICL Pathway:
a. The Counter Manager Course was revised to emphasise and provide
more coverage of the balancing process, with much of the second day

of the course devoted to this.

Page 48 of 193
FUJ00126035
FUJ00126035

b. The HFSO training programme was revised to provide more
opportunities to practice migration processes. ICL Pathway re-trained
HFSOs during Live Trial to increase coverage of balancing and related
topics. ICL Pathway also developed a new three-day course for HFSOs
to be attended after the POL induction training and before the five-day
HFSO course. This provided in-depth coverage of balancing, the cash
account, reversals, use of the suspense account, error detection and
correction. |CL Pathway reported to POL that this new course had been
“very well received” by POL HFSOs and POL observers, “who were
pleased that their comments from Live Trial were taken onboard [sic]”

(FSL_04/229).

c. Additional balancing training was provided on a weekly basis through the

use of ICL Trainers. The cost of this was borne by ICL Pathway.

d. The number of ‘Transition Executives’ (“TE”), whose role it was to
provide help and support to HFSOs, was doubled to eight, such that an

extra TE was added to each region.

e. In July 1999, the Horizon system was installed in 24 additional outlets to
form a basis on which the effectiveness of the changes to the training

programme could be (and were) demonstrated (FSL_04/230).

152. On 10 August 1999, Bruce McNiven (Director of the Horizon Programme) wrote
to John Dicks of ICL Pathway enclosing an evaluation of the changes
implemented in relation to Al 218. Mr McNiven stated in this letter that while many
of the agreed criteria had been met, “the training and go-live process relies on

the deployment of POCL HFSP recourse...without this resource there would

Page 49 of 193

154.

155.

FUJ00126035

FUJ00126035

have to be a complete revision of the training approach in order to ensure
helpdesks were not rendered ineffective by the high level of calls”. POL was not
willing to reduce the severity rating of Al 218 from ‘high’ (FSL_04/233).
According to the minutes of a POL meeting on 11 August 1999, POL’s view was
that “Training has not been adequate... With ICL, we have worked on a range of
solutions. While these solutions have improved the position, staff have only been
able to cope as well as they do, because of HFSO support’ (FSL_04/234).

The following day, Mr Dicks wrote in a letter to Mr McNiven that ICL Pathway
“has done everything it can to improve the training and prepare users for
Horizon”, and that the remaining issues to be addressed, including user
confidence in the system, “will be achieved only through managing the change
in POCL business processes such that POCL’s target standard approach is
adopted across the Post Office network”. Until this was achieved, “it will be
necessary for POCL to substitute additional support in one form or another’. For
these reasons, ICL Pathway’s view was that Al 218 should be closed and no
further revisions were required to the training courses, save for “minor
improvements already identified” (FSL_04/229).

On 12 August 1999, ICL Pathway and POL discussed Al 218 at a Management
Resolution Meeting. According to the minutes of this meeting, POL repeated its
view that the training programme at that time was insufficient to satisfy
Requirement 915. ICL Pathway disagreed with this, on the basis that changes to
the training courses had already been implemented and a distinction needed to
be drawn between the training courses and changes being introduced to POL’s

business processes (FSL_04/235).

FUJ00126035

FUJ00126035

On 13 August 1999, a joint workshop was held at which actions were agreed for
the resolution of Al 218, including the introduction of a new pre-entry event
intended to, (i) “demystify computers’, (ii) introduce standard balance
terminology, and (iii) explain the change from a manual to an automated system,
for approximately 20% of the user population. In response, ICL Pathway offered
to develop and run, in conjunction with POL, 370 half-day events for up to 3,700
office managers (FSL_04/230). Potentially suitable candidates for the course
would need to be identified by POL (FSL_04/236).

As set out in the First Corporate Statement, CSR Acceptance was not achieved
by the 16 August 1999 target date specified in the Codified Agreement. Al 218
was one of the three ‘Disputed Category A Faults’ identified in the Supplemental
Agreement as outstanding at the end of the CSR Operational Trial Review period
(FSL_04/237).

ICL Pathway issued its Acceptance Proposal in relation to Al 218 on 23 August
1999 in which it submitted that the Acceptance Incident should be closed as the
‘Clearance Plan’ had been successfully implemented. The proposal stated that
“no effort has been spared to develop training events suitable for the wide range
of users in the POCL network. However, we strongly maintain that the success
of a programme of this size cannot be achieved by training alone. A change
management approach must exist for pre-entry and steady state environments
as well as for formal training”. \CL Pathway’s position was that the balancing
process was too complicated for a high proportion of branches and that training
was only part of the “massive change programme” that POL was undertaking by
automating the Post Office network. The Acceptance Proposal also stated that,

since 1996:

Page 51 of 193
159.

160.

161.

FUJ00126035

FUJ00126035

a. training events had been extended to provide more detailed training;
b. the training course population had increased from 67,000 to 72,000;

c. the number of training events to be provided by ICL Pathway increased
from 12,000 to 12,600 “to provide contingency for lower than expected

attendance”; and

d. following the cancellation of the benefits card, specific benefit card

training was replaced by training focussing on balancing (FSL_04/230).

As set out in Fujitsu’s First Corporate Statement, CSR Acceptance and
authorisation by the Release Authorisation Board for national rollout were
deemed to have been achieved on 24 September 1999. The Second
Supplemental Agreement dated 24 September 1999 recorded Al 218 as one of
the 13 Acceptance Incidents outstanding at the date of the Agreement
(FSL_04/238). By the terms of the Second Supplemental Agreement, the parties
agreed to use reasonable endeavours to resolve Al 218 in accordance with the
Resolution Plan for Al 218 referred to in Schedule 2 of the Second Supplemental
Agreement (FSL_04/239)

Section 3 of the Resolution Plan for Al 218 recorded that changes had been
made to the Counter Managers Course to spend more time principally on stock
unit balancing and cash account, and that these changes had proved successful
in live events. It also listed the following seven agreed areas for potential
improvement in association with Al 218. All activities listed had either been
completed or were on schedule to be completed (FSL_04/239).

Contractually, ICL Pathway was required to meet the critical success factors set

out in the table headed ‘Critical Success Factors’ in the Resolution Plan. These

Page 52 of 193
162.

163.

164.

FUJ00126035

FUJ00126035

included that all branches should be able to complete the cash account balance
process and, on average, the NBSC should not receive more than 1.2 calls per
week from each branch when performing their first two balances.
As part of the Rectification Plan, and following a review of the presentation of the
PSA, the methodology which KnowledgePool trainers were to follow when
presenting the PSA to delegates was amended. POL had expressed concern
that, up to September 1999, no delegates had been passed back to POL as being
unable to use the system (FSL_04/240).
According to an ICL Pathway Progress Summary for Input to Horizon / Pathway
Delivery Meeting dated 24th November 1999, “[a]// ICL Pathway actions on the
Al 218 Rectification Plan” were complete and a joint meeting was scheduled with
POL on 22 November 1999 to assess performance against the agreed criteria.
ICL Pathway’s latest commitment had been to submit KnowledgePool’s Trainer
Quality Monitoring report, which had been done during the week ending 19
November 1999. This progress summary also reported that the pilot of the Pre-
Entry Event took place on 9 November 1999 and was “well received by POCL
delegates and Training representatives” (FSL_04/241).
The Trainer Quality Monitoring report explained the processes used to ensure
consistency and quality of trainers presenting the Horizon training, based on
KnowledgePool’s standard procedures which had been adapted for the Horizon
project. In summary:
a. Delegate feedback: Delegates were requested to complete evaluation
questionnaires at the end of every session. The scores and comments
provided by delegates were recorded against the relevant trainer’s

record and the KnowledgePool Training Operations Manager (“TOM”)

Page 53 of 193
FUJ00126035

FUJ00126035

would be informed of results which were either below the satisfactory
level or exceptionally good. If negative comments were received, the
TOM would review all evaluation questionnaires for the course to
establish if it was an isolated comment. If a trend emerged, the TOM
would arrange for an observer to attend the next appropriate event run
by that trainer, who would provide feedback to the trainer regarding
areas of deficiency and agree a plan for rectifying any issues. If the
trainer demonstrated a fundamental problem with the bulk of the course,
they would be given the opportunity to retrain, following which they would
be observed again. If they failed to deliver to the required standard on
their second observed course, they would be removed from the training

programme.

. Observations: Each trainer would be observed by KnowledgePool
accredited trainers at least once every 30 days. A number of random,
unannounced visits would also be made each month. Observers would
use a standard marking guide to ensure consistency, including use of
the correct documentation, correct set up, the trainer's style and
ensuring key learning points are covered. The results of the observations
would be reported by back to ICL Pathway, together with a short

indication of any necessary action taken.

. Complaints and comments: Any complaints or comments from POL
regarding training would be routed via the ICL Pathway Training and
Awareness Manager and would be investigated. The Training and

Awareness Manager would provide feedback to POL and an overview

Page 54 of 193
165.

166.

167.

168.

FUJ00126035

FUJ00126035

of the responses to complaints or comments would be provided as part

of regular Training Review Meetings (FSL_04/242).

The ICL Pathway Progress Summary for Input to Horizon / Pathway Delivery
Meeting dated 8 December 1999 reported on progress against the 13
outstanding Acceptance Incidents. According to this report, all ICL Pathway
actions in relation to Al 218 were “now complete and agreed. There are still some
actions that require POCL to complete which will fully close Al 218"
(FSL_04/243).

According to a Performance Review Report for Al 218 dated 2 December 1999,
it had been agreed at the meeting on 22 November 1999 between ICL Pathway
and POL that the Rectification Plan had been followed to the satisfaction of both
parties (FSL_04/244).

During the period following the Second Supplemental Agreement, a number of
further changes were proposed to the timings of events during the training and
implementation cycle, including Change Proposal 2650 which was raised to
extend the length of the Counter Managers course to two days. The benefits of
this included that more time would be available to spend on balancing and related
topics, which would potentially reduce the volumes of calls to the Service Desk
regarding balancing (FSL_04/245).

During the last phases of national rollout, the option of onsite counter assistant
and postmaster courses was introduced. According to Change Control Note
0731, which was raised in November 2000, the branches to be installed during
the final sweep of installations (the “tail”) were geographically dispersed so

classroom-based training was expected to be poorly attended (FSL_04/246).

Page 55 of 193
169.

170.

FUJ00126035

FUJ00126035

The specification for these onsite courses was set out in an “Onsite and
Combined CM/CA Course Specification Document” (FSL_04/247).

Following national rollout, responsibility for training staff was handed over to
POL. According to Change Proposal 2372, this included training on CSR+ where
it was being implemented in branches which had already gone live on the Horizon
system (FSL_04/248).

According to Change Control Note 620, in April 2000, PON was considering its
options to ensure that existing users of CSR became competent in CSR+ once
it became available. POL sought a proposal from ICL Pathway as to how they
would approach the delivery of training for CSR+ to existing Horizon users, and
the associated costs of this. Fujitsu understands that POL ultimately decided to
undertake this work themselves (FSL_04/249). Fujitsu also understands that ICL
Pathway and POL agreed terms for POL to use the ICL Pathway training

materials in developing ‘steady state’ training (FSL_04/250 and FSL_04/251).

MANAGEMENT CARE VISIT PROGRAMME

171.

The following section of this corporate statement addresses the Inquiry’s
questions in relation to the Management Care Visit Programme (the “MCVP”)
and expands on information provided in the First Corporate Statement in this

regard.

Background

172.

The purpose of the MCVP is described in the MCVP Process Definition. This
provides that the MCVP was designed to monitor postmaster perception in
respect of services that ICL Pathway, and later Fujitsu, delivered (FSL_04/252).

The MCVP was managed by the Customer Services department (FSL_04/253).

FUJ00126035

Participation in the MCVP was optional and postmasters were required to opt-in
before a visit was arranged. MCVP visits were originally attended by an ICL
Pathway Field Service Manager (as described in more detail above). Following
a reform of the MCVP process in 2001, visits were carried out by MCVP
managers from ICL Pathway and POL.

Feedback from MCVP visits was collated to assist ICL Pathway in understanding

postmaster issues and concerns (FSL_04/252).

The initial MCVP process

175.

176.

As noted in the Monthly Progress Report for August 1997 (FSL_04/254), ICL
Pathway presented its plans for the MCVP to POL Regional Liaison Managers
in or around that time. It appears that the MCVP was planned to be performed
on an annual basis, with visits to around 500 Post Office branches every year
following the national rollout. Prior to national rollout, a smaller subset of Post
Office branches were to form part of the programme (FSL_04/253).

Progress updates were generally recorded in ICL Pathway Monthly Progress
Reports. For example, it was reported that in:

a. November 1997, 16 MCVP visits had been conducted and feedback
remained encouraging (FSL_04/255);

b. December 1997, MCVP visits carried out to date had focused entirely on
Release 1b, a software release, and overall satisfaction of the services
provided was over 90%. It was also noted that positive responses were
obtained in relation to the Service Desk and services provided by Horizon
system engineers. Concerns were raised in relation to training schedules,
and the travel and costs associated with attending such training sessions

(FSL_04/256); and

177.

FUJ00126035

FUJ00126035

c. September 1998, progress on the MCVP was ‘inadequate’, stating that
only 23 visits had been completed, 28 had been scheduled and 49 were
yet to be arranged (FSL_04/257).

Further details of the MCVP process in these early years is set out in CS
Operations Manuals (see, for example, FSL_04/23, FSL_04/63, FSL_04/64 and

FSL_04/253).

Preparation and Training

178.

179.

180.

According to the CS Operations Manuals, before any contact was made with
Post Office branches, Field Service Managers were provided with certain
information from the Customer Satisfaction Manager (and in later stages of the
programme, the Strategic Services Implementation Manager) (as applicable, the
“FSM Manager’), including (but not limited to):

a. the purpose and goals of the MCVP;

b. the interview procedure and questionnaire;

c. any other relevant documentation; and

d. address and questions or concerns raised by interviewers.
Field Service Managers conducting interviews followed a standard procedure so
that results could be fairly compared, and accurate analysis could be obtained.
The CS Operations Manuals provide that documentation was given to Field
Service Managers in electronic and paper form, which included a hard copy
predefined interview pack which could be taken to the interviews. The interview
packs themselves are said to have contained:

a. aprocedure document, including an Interview Summary Guide designed

to be used as a reference guide during interview. A copy of this guide is

Page 58 of 193
181.

FUJ00126035

FUJ00126035

set out in the Customer Service: Service Management Operations Manual
(FSL_04/253);
b. a phone script to be followed when contacting Post Office branches to
arrange an appointment;
c. sample forms;
d. a questionnaire and associated documents; and
e. alist of post offices to contact.
The CS Operations Manuals explain that, prior to their visits, Field Service
Managers were required to review the recent Service Desk call history of their
allocated Post Office branches, to determine whether a visit was necessary. For
example, FSL_04/253 states: “[T]he call history should be assessed to check
that there is no reason why the post offices should not be contacted now to

arrange a visit.”

The MCVP Interview

182.

183.

In accordance with the CS Operations Manuals, once it was decided that a visit
was necessary, the Field Service Manager would contact the relevant branch
directly, following a phone script to arrange an appointment. Once confirmed, the
FSM Manager would be informed accordingly to record appointment details in
an Appointments Database.
The questionnaire provided to Field Service Managers described the general
structure of MCVP interviews. Based on the CS Operation Manuals, the
questionnaire had eleven sections:
a. Section 2: general details of how the implementation of the Horizon
system went at the Post Office branch. Responses to this section were

not included in the analysis process;

Page 59 of 193
FUJ00126035
FUJ00126035

b. Section 3 to 10: multiple choice questions, each with positive and negative
answer options which could be supplemented with comments; and

c. Section 11: a chance for the interviewees to express any concerns,
problems or suggestions for improvement in respect of the Horizon
system and its associated services.

184. The CS Operations Manuals set out a number of action points following the
interview.

Analysis and Reporting

185. According to the CS Operations Manuals, the FSM Manager was responsible for
the analysis of feedback from MCVP visits and publication of monthly and
quarterly reports summarising their findings. Monthly reports were for internal
use only. Quarterly reports were said to have been provided to POL via the
Horizon Satisfaction Forum.

186. The CS Operations Manuals state that concerns, suggestions or comments
which required further action were recorded separately on the data analysis
spreadsheet as a log for action. Subsequent action was also to be recorded and
kept open until a satisfactory conclusion was reached, after which the action
would be marked as closed. It was the responsibility of the FSM Manager to
maintain this log. It is also noted that the FSM Manager only contacted Post
Office branches to follow up on feedback if it was agreed by the interviewee and
only when considered necessary by ICL Pathway.

Revised MCVP Process

187. The MCVP appears to have been reviewed by ICL Pathway and POL in or
around 2000 and 2001. The “Customer Service Monthly Report — July 2001”

explains that a revised MCVP process was introduced around mid-2001

Page 60 of 193
FUJ00126035
FUJ00126035

(FSL_04/258). The revised process is documented in the MCVP Process
Definition (FSL_04/252).
188. Under this revised process:
a. POL became responsible for contacting the Post Office branches to
arrange the visits;
b. interviews were to be conducted using an Aide Memoir document as a
prompt, (FSL_04/259) in addition to questionnaires;
c. interviews were to be conducted by MCVP managers from POL and ICL
Pathway. The ICL Pathway MCVP manager could conduct interviews
alone if the POL MCVP manager did not attend the Post Office branch;
and
d. The administration of the MCVP process was shared between POL and
ICL Pathway. A copy of the questionnaire was left with the postmaster
to complete after the visit and returned to POL. The questionnaire results
were shared with the ICL Pathway MCVP administrator on a quarterly
basis. The ICL Pathway MCVP manager submitted the completed Aide
Memoirs to the ICL Pathway MCVP administrator for input into a
database for analysis. The MCVP Process Definition explains that “A//
results produced by the ICL MCVP administrator will be archived every
quarter. All archived data will be kept for a 5-year period and then
destroyed.”
189. The MCVP was withdrawn in or around December 2003.
KNOWLEDGE AND RECTIFICATION OF BUGS
190. As explained in Fujitsu’s opening statement dated 4 October 2022, no complex

IT system will ever be completely free of bugs, errors and defects (“BEDs’).

Page 61 of 193
191.

192.

193.

194.

FUJ00126035

FUJ00126035

Fujitsu’s monitoring systems and processes seek to identify faults, log them as
Incidents, and then work to resolve them following the agreed Incident
management processes. Fujitsu also relies on Incidents being reported by
postmasters directly, or by POL. Many thousands of Incidents have been logged
since the inception of Horizon.

In relation to the 29 BEDs listed by Mr Justice Fraser in Appendix 1 to the Horizon
Issues Judgment (the “Technical Appendix”), the Inquiry has asked Fujitsu to
provide details relating to the identification, investigation, communication and
resolution of the BEDs.

In February 2021, Fujitsu helped to prepare a report for POL in relation to the 29
BEDs identified by Mr Justice Fraser (the “BED Report”). This BED Report has
been disclosed to Core Participants and is exhibited to this corporate statement
at (FSL_04/260).

In addition to the BED Report, Fujitsu has set out in Appendix 1 a series of
summaries addressing each of the 29 BEDs and any sub-issues identified within
those classifications. The BED Report and the summaries set out in Appendix 1
of this corporate statement seek to build on the Technical Appendix and have
been prepared by reference to a variety of sources. These summaries are
indicative of, amongst other things: (i) the investigation of each issue, (ii) the
resolution of each issue, (iii) communication with other parties, including POL
and wider management, and (iv) the impact on branches.

The summaries in Appendix 1 are based on a review of contemporaneous
documents, primarily in the form of PiniCLs, Peaks and KELs, that have been
identified as related to the relevant BED. The summaries should be read in

conjunction with these underlying records.

Page 62 of 193
195.

196.

197.

198.

Appendix 2 to this corporate statement includes a table of PinICLs, Peaks and
KELs that Fujitsu has identified as being relevant or linked to the 29 BEDs
(FSL_04/311 to FSL_04/640).

Given the nature of the issues, the appendices are not intended to be an
exhaustive list of all documents relevant to each BED.

in order to assist the Inquiry, Fujitsu has disclosed to the Inquiry various
communications between itself and POL in relation to the 29 BEDs.

The Inquiry has also asked about the existence of any other problems / bugs or
other sources of error in the Horizon system from the pilot to the date of the
Request. In this regard, Fujitsu has disclosed records from the PinCL, Peak and
KEL databases (as described above) created on or before 31 December 2000.
As described in this corporate statement, there are procedures in place to
monitor issues in the Horizon system, and records which fall within the Inquiry’s
requests have been produced with this corporate statement. Fujitsu is prepared
to disclose the remaining records contained within the PinICL, Peak and KEL

databases to the Inquiry should that be of assistance.

APPENDIX 1: SUMMARY OF THE 29 BEDs

BED 1 — RECEIPTS AND PAYMENTS MISMATCH

. Documents relating to Fujitsu’s knowledge, rectification and communication of
this issue, including PinlCLs/Peaks and KELs, are set out in Appendix 2
(FSL_04/311 to FSL_04/316).

. The issue allowed postmasters to rollover with an unresolved discrepancy. The
impact of the problem was that the stock unit appeared to have balanced, and
the discrepancy could be carried over unnoticed until the branch tried to roll their
accounts over at the end of the next accounting period, whereupon the accounts
were found to be out of balance.

e In September 2010, Fujitsu opened a number of Peaks in relation to the issue:
PC0204263 (FSL_04/312), PC0204765 (FSL_04/313), and PC0203864
(FSL_04/315). Fujitsu identified the circumstances in which it happened and the
branches that were affected (FSL_04/261). Affected branches were identified by
searching for specific event codes in system logs from the point at which HNG-
X had gone live. This analysis was cross-checked by POL in their own back-end
system (FSL_04/262).

° Fujitsu produced reports in relation to the issue for POL (see for example, “lost
discrepancies.doc” dated 28 September 2010 (FSL_04/263 and FSL_04/264).
This provided a summary of the issue, and the stated purpose of the note was
to:

a. “Summarise the problem in terms that are meaningful to Post Office
Ltd
b. Define a process for identifying all affected branches

c. Explain what analysis is needed on each affected branch

Page 99 of 193
FUJ00126035

FUJ00126035

d. Define what ongoing monitoring is required to pick up further
occurrences of the issue until the root cause of the problem is fixed
e. Provide a basis for agreeing the necessary data fixes with Post Office
Ltd; and how they are to be applied

f. Explain how each problem branch can be fixed”
In early October 2010, POL and Fujitsu held a conference call to discuss the
issue. A meeting note was produced showing attendees from POL and Fujitsu
including the headings: “What is the issue?”, “Impact’, “Identifying the issue and
forward resolution”, “Proposal for affected Branches’, and “Action Point
Summary’ (FSL_04/265).
Following the call, there were further communications between Fujitsu and the
POL Duty Manager with updates as to the affected branches and the financial
impact (FSL_04/266). To assist the Inquiry, further communication with POL
includes: FSL_04/264, FSL_04/265 and FSL_04/267 to FSL_04/269. On 11
November 2010, POL emailed FSL: “/ have a conference call on Monday with
senior stakeholders within POL[.] | need a full update for Receipts and Payments”
(FSL_04/270). An internal Fujitsu staff member noted: “I’ve been sending a
report every week to Pol [sic] Duty Manager...” (FSL_04/269).
The issue was also part of the agenda for a number of the monthly Service
Management Reviews that were held with Fujitsu and POL (FSL_04/271 and
FSL_04/272).
A report titled “Receipts and Payments.doc” (FSL_04/273), dated 17 February
2011, was drafted in response to POL’s request to “put together a “storyboard”
showing the precise steps all the way through the problem [i.e. the receipts and

payments mismatch issue], consisting of screen shots and snapshot reports from

Page 100 of 193

FUJ00126035

the system. This will assist in the explanation of the issue to senior management
and, if necessary, the Press” (FSL_04/274). Rod Ismay, Head of Product and
Branch Accounting — Finance (POL), provided input on the final document
(FSL_04/275).

An email dated 20 February 2011 from the POL service delivery team stated “[a]s
per the normal process, Fujitsu reported the issue into the SD Live Service Desk
once the discrepancies were identified by the HNG system. SD pulled together
a team of stakeholders to assess the issue and track through to resolution, this
included; Fujitsu, P&BA, IT&C, Security, Network and Legal PC0204263
(FSL_04/276).

The issue was rectified by firstly correcting the reference data on 13 October
2010 (FSL_04/312). The reference data correction was effective once counters
received the 02.12 counter upgrade, which was rolled out to the live estate in
mid-October 2010 (FSL_04/277).

KEL wrightm33145J was also written which described the problem to allow the
Service Desk to recognise that the issue had occurred again if contacted by
branches (FSL_04/316).

The software issue that caused the discrepancy was monitored for future

occurrences (FSL_04/264).

BED 2 - CALLENDAR SQUARE

Documents relating to Fujitsu's knowledge, rectification and communication of
this issue, including PinlICLs/Peaks and KELs, are set out in Appendix 2
(FSL_04/317 to FSL_04/342).

A problem existed in Horizon whereby, on occasion, a ‘lock’ was not released,
and a second process would then wait for a given time before it ‘timed out’ and
reported an error saying it could not proceed. The problem could occur in various
places in the Horizon applications. In the initial occurrences a reboot of the
counter allowed the system to resume proper function with no data lost.

In some cases, in the Callendar Square branch in particular, the lock problem
caused data to be lost when carrying out transfers between different ‘stock units’,
thereby causing receipts and payments mismatches.

There appear to have been instances of these Riposte lock errors from at least
September 2000, such as PC0056922 (FSL_04/320). In this instance, a
postmaster reported an error message when trying to re-declare their cash. The
call was discussed between various teams from POL and Fujitsu. To assist the
Inquiry, further examples include (but are not limited to): PC0057957,
(FSL_04/322), PC0058994 (FSL_04/323), PC0078592 (FSL_04/342) and
PC0083563 (FSL_04/326).

KEL JBallantyne5245K (FSL_04/319) advised that restarting Riposte, or
rebooting the counter, would resolve incidents where a message reported a
timeout waiting for a lock. Some of these also led to receipts and payments
mismatches, which after investigation, were dealt with by the Fujitsu MSU team
raising a BIMS report so POL could issue an error notice (later known as a

transaction correction) to the postmaster to allow them to reconcile the accounts.

Page 102 of 193
FUJ00126035

FUJ00126035

BIMS reports set out the progress to the resolution of a ‘Business Incident’. POL
would use the information from the BIMS report to carry out reconciliation or
settlement with their clients.

It was identified that an error in the underlying Escher Riposte software caused
the lock problem. The issue was raised with Escher, who developed a fix. The fix
was implemented in the S90 software release. The S90 release was scheduled
to start on 4 March 2006 for completion by 14 April 2006 (FSL_04/278). As of 22
March 2006, the S90 migration report showed that the counter release was
99.9% complete (FSL_04/279 and FSL_04/337).

Fujitsu monitored the issue. For example, on 27 March 2006, a Fujitsu employee

noted on PC0127246 that the timeout locks had “gone right down” (FSL_04/339).

BED 3 - SUSPENSE ACCOUNT BUG

Documents relating to Fujitsu's knowledge, rectification and communication of
this issue, including PinICLs/Peaks and KELs, are set out in Appendix 2
(FSL_04/343 to FSL_04/344).

A cchange introduced into Horizon in July 2011 had the unintended consequence
of leaving certain ‘orphaned’ records from November / December 2010 relating
to a branch’s suspense account in a table in the branch database, rather than
archiving them. The consequence was that, once a year, when an impacted
branch produced its trading statement, if they had any amount in their suspense
account, the suspense account records from 2010 were also pulled in so that the
branch trading statement showed an erroneous amount in the suspense account.
When the problem resurfaced a year later, a postmaster contacted Fujitsu and a
Peak (PC0223870) was raised on 25 February 2013 (FSL_04/344). Fujitsu then
diagnosed the issue and identified 14 branches as being affected.

Following this, Fujitsu held a conference call with POL’s Problem Manager for
this issue (FSL_04/344). The orphaned records were subsequently removed by
the Fujitsu development team. An extra set of checks were introduced in October
2013 so that if a similar problem surfaced in the future, an error message would

be displayed to the postmaster telling them to contact the Horizon Service Desk.

BED 4 - DALMELLINGTON

° Documents relating to Fujitsu’s knowledge, rectification and communication of
this issue, including PinlICLs/Peaks and KELs, are set out in Appendix 2
(FSL_04/345 to FSL_04/352).

° This problem manifested when a specific sequence of events occurred:

a. A user was logged out while they were part-way through the login
process, either because of user inactivity at the counter, or because
of a failure in network connectivity.

b. Some time later, the user logged back in and manually ‘remmed-in’ a
pouch of cash into the account.

c. Normally, when a pouch was remmec-in, a ‘rem slip’ would be printed
and the user would continue to another screen.

d. In this particular circumstance, the rem slip would be printed but the
system stayed on the same screen, and if the user pressed enter
again, another rem slip would be printed, and the cash amount would
be added to the account again. The branch accounts would therefore
now show twice the cash than had actually been received.

. On 8 October 2015, a postmaster reported an incident to the NBSC and Atos,
who was responsible the first line support for Horizon at the time (FSL_04/280).
On 10 October 2015, Fujitsu raised the KEL Acha621P — V1. This KEL described
the symptoms of the bug and stated “the cause of the problem is being
investigated” (FSL_04/346). On 13 October 2015, another call (PC0246949) was
raised (FSL_04/345). The call was originally made to the NBSC and was later

routed to Fujitsu for investigation.

FUJ00126035

FUJ00126035

By 15 October 2015, Fujitsu understood how the problem occurred, had
identified that the problem had also recently occurred in other branches, and had
raised a KEL as a workaround to address the issue, and a development Peak
(PC0246997) for a code fix (FSL_04/349).

At the time, the issue was escalated within both Fujitsu and POL (FSL_04/281 to
FSL_04/290)

According to KEL Acha621P, the fix was commenced in January 2016
(FSL_04/350). By 14 January 2016, there were around 400 counters that were
yet to receive the fix (FSL_04/352).

In relation to the testing of the issue, DEV/CNT/CTP/3008 - ODR Further
Investigation - Component Test Plan is a “Description of the approach to be taken
for further testing required in relation to "ODR" - Outreach and Duplicate Rems

issues” (FSL_04/291).

BED 5 — REMMING IN BUG — ISSUE 1

Documents relating to Fujitsu's knowledge, rectification and communication of
this issue, including PinlICLs/Peaks and KELs, are set out in Appendix 2
(FSL_04/353 to FSL_04/376).

This problem arose if (i) a postmaster tried to rem-in a pouch on one counter, (ii)
encountered an issue, such as a printing problem before completing the process,
then (iii) tried again on another counter. This sequence could cause the pouch to
be registered twice in the Horizon system, causing a discrepancy in the branch
accounts.

On 17 August 2010, PC0203085 was raised (FSL_04/372). Fujitsu distinguished
this from the other type of remming in bug (BED 5, Issue 2). On 18 August 2010,
a BIMS was raised for the branch so POL could issue a correction to the
accounts. KEL acha4221Q was added to the call (FSL_04/370). The Peak went
through testing and by 23 January 2011, the fix was applied to the live estate as

“part of PSPID Release HRU7284B_PR for 03.21.00.50”.

BED 5 — REMMING IN BUG — ISSUE 2

Documents relating to Fujitsu's knowledge, rectification and communication of
this issue, including PinlICLs/Peaks and KELs, are set out in Appendix 2
(FSL_04/353 to FSL_04/376).

If a postmaster used the ‘prev’ (previous screen) button to move backwards
during the process of remming in a cash pouch, and then scanned the same
barcode again, Horizon would register the pouch twice, leading to a discrepancy
in the branch accounts.

This incident was first raised to Fujitsu on 2 March 2010 by a postmaster who
was participating in the HNG-X pilot (FSL_04/368). The postmaster had checked
their reports and found a pouch had been remmed in twice. Similar issues were
reported by postmasters on 3 March 2010 (PC0195511, FSL_04/354), 17 March
2010 (PC0196120, FSL_04/356), and 18 March 2010 (PC0196154,
FSL_04/355).

In diagnosing the extent of the issue, Fujitsu identified affected branches in
March 2010. Fujitsu used this as a basis to run a daily report (the ‘Check Rems’
report) which would be sent to the reconciliation team to identify further
occurrences. A number of Peaks were opened after Fujitsu had identified
potential double remming of pouches (FSL_04/357, FSL_04/359 and
FSL_04/362). Generally, these Peaks were investigated and reported to POL so
that a Transaction Correction could be issued.

The fix was tested by the Live Support Team on 25 March 2010 and was sent to

all counters on 22 April 2010 (PC0195911, FSL_04/353).

BED 6 - REMMING OUT BUG — ISSUE 1

Documents relating to Fujitsu's knowledge, rectification and communication of
this issue, including PinlICLs/Peaks and KELs, are set out in Appendix 2
(FSL_04/373 and FSL_04/377 to FSL_04/405).

A coding error in a specific counter release (T30 INC1) caused imbalances when
remming out multiple pouches of coins, which could cause discrepancies.

The issue was first reported to Fujitsu on 12 February 2007 by a postmaster who
had observed the problem (PC0143435, FSL_04/401). The issue was initially
reported to the NBSC. Analysis from the SSC recognised that this would cause
a receipts and payments mismatch, and that the problem could affect cash, stock
and foreign exchange rem outs.

Many instances of this problem were identified through reconciliation reports and
affected branches were contacted by Fujitsu. See for example, PC0143503 at
FSL_04/396. Other instances were reported by POL directly (see for example,
PC0143514 at FSL_04/386), including one in April 2007 at a branch where the
release regression (the fix mentioned below) had failed (PC0144937,
FSL_04/403) (PC0144933, FSL_04/399).

Fujitsu reported on possible branches that were affected in email
correspondence between Fujitsu and POL (FSL_04/292). Fujitsu also prepared
a report titled ‘Rem Misbalance’, setting out the nature and extent of the problem
(FSL_04/293 and FSL_04/294). Fujitsu asked POL to distribute the paper to
relevant POL employees (FSL_04/295). The discussion as to whether to inform

postmasters about the issue was discussed internally within POL (FSL_04/292).

FUJ00126035

Generally, a Transaction Correction (issued by POL) would have been required
to fix the issue. It was also necessary to carry out an Operational Change
Request ("OCR") to correct the data destined for POL’s back-office systems.

A fix was identified by 19 February 2007, and on 4 June 2007, it was reported to
be live across all branches (FSL_04/401). According to the February 2007
Service Review Book, the T30 INC1 release was ‘regressed’, i.e., as far as
possible counter applications were returned to the previous release, on the night
of 12 February 2007 (FSL_04/296). KEL acha508S records that Fujitsu’s SSC
team had contacted the affected branches to provide advice as to what to do to
remedy rem out issues (FSL_04/391).

Release Notes RNT3035D and RNT3036C were both created on or around 22

February 2007 to monitor and track the progress of the releases.

BED 6 - REMMING OUT BUG — ISSUE 2

Documents relating to Fujitsu's knowledge, rectification and communication of
this issue, including PinlICLs/Peaks and KELs, are set out in Appendix 2
(FSL_04/373 and FSL_04/377 to FSL_04/405).

A postmaster attempted to rem out a pouch of coins. Upon receiving a message
that the bar code was invalid, they were able to use the home button, which
should not have been possible (PC0120937, FSL_04/378). This caused the
transaction to be left in the branch suspense account.

The problem was raised on 13 May 2005 by the postmaster. Following discussion
between the SSC and Development team via the Peak, it was agreed that a KEL
(GMaxwell3853P) would be raised in case future incidents were reported
(FSL_04/377). Per PC0120937, Fujitsu understands the SSC also checked
Peaks that had been raised since the introduction of Release S60 and were
unable to identify previous occurrences. The call was passed back to the NBSC

for rectification. The Peak was closed on 15 June 2005.

BED 7 - LOCAL SUSPENSE ACCOUNT ISSUE

Documents relating to Fujitsu's knowledge, rectification and communication of
this issue, including PinlICLs/Peaks and KELs, are set out in Appendix 2
(FSL_04/406 to FSL_04/425).

This issue was a combination of two issues: (i) a coding error in the Branch
Access Layer (“BAL”) server application referred to as a ‘threading error’, and (ii)
insufficient error handling in the counter application, meant that when
unexpected messages were received the counter either did not recognise that
an error had occurred, and therefore behaved unexpectedly, or did not deal with
the error in a helpful way.

The combination of these two issues manifested at the counter in at least four
ways, which were initially documented in several Peaks: PC0196767,
PC0197409 and PC0197797 (FSL_04/420, FSL_04/421 and FSL_04/415,
respectively). Fujitsu's records indicate that the Local Suspense Account issue
was first noted on 29 March 2010 in Peak PC0196767 (FSL_04/420). The Peak
noted that “OCR 26169 has been raised” (FSL_04/297). The branch appeared
in a TPSC Harvester Exception report and a TPSC257 (POLFS Incomplete
Summaries) report, and showed three new harvester exceptions.

Fujitsu identified affected branches and discussed this with POL (FSL_04/298 to
FSL_04/300).

A workaround was provided in KEL cardc2043L on 15 April 2010 (FSL_04/408).
Fujitsu’s SSC and development teams worked together on these issues and
determined that, whilst most incidents were raised because of issues at the
counter, the root cause was on the BAL server. By 18 April 2010, development

had managed to reproduce the problem and by 22 April 2010, code fixes required

Page 112 of 193
FUJ00126035
FUJ00126035

to the BAL server applications had been identified (FSL_04/420). Testing of the
BAL server fixes was fast-tracked and underway by 28 April 2010. The Peak was
marked “release to live” on 17 May 2010. On 8 July 2010, the fix was rolled out
in BAL_SRV_OSR_0122_V058-V057 (FSL_04/421 and FSL_04/422). In
September 2010, the “[clounter release RNT9612 delivering Tivoli Product
COUNTER_X0210 54_1” had begun its roll out to the live estate (FSL_04/406

and FSL_04/301).

BED 8 —- RECOVERY ISSUES — ISSUE 1

Documents relating to Fujitsu's knowledge, rectification and communication of
this issue, including PinlICLs/Peaks and KELs, are set out in Appendix 2
(FSL_04/426 to FSL_04/439).

During the pilot of Horizon Online, an issue occurred when there was a failed
transaction on one stock unit and the user then logged into another stock unit to
invoke the recovery for the failed transaction. In this instance, a transaction could
be recovered to the wrong trading period.

Peak PC0197769 was raised on 15 April 2010 in relation to the issue. A
postmaster reported a balancing issue after a clerk had swapped terminals
(FSL_04/428).

The problem itself was described in a report on issues likely to impact the POL’s
Product and Branch Accounting team, prepared by Fujitsu for the Joint Steering
Board at the request of lan Trundell (POL) (FSL_04/302). The SSC concluded
that the issue could have an impact on branch accounts. On 29 April 2010, an
email indicated that Fujitsu had identified 13 branches which might have been
affected by this problem, and that, on 26 May 2010, three more had been
identified (FSL_04/303). Details were passed to the Fujitsu Reconciliation team
so that any accounting discrepancies could be communicated to POL for

rectification.

BED 8 —- RECOVERY ISSUES ~ ISSUE 2

Documents relating to Fujitsu's knowledge, rectification and communication of
this issue, including PinICLs/Peaks and KELs, are set out in Appendix 2
(FSL_04/426 to FSL_04/439).

There were a number of failed recoveries within this issue. These are broadly
grouped into: (i) State 4 recovery failures, (ii) State 4 pin pad issues, and (iii)

recovery failures due to printer error.

State 4 Recovery failures

KEL acha959t identifies the circumstances which could cause a transaction to
be in State 4 (FSL_04/439). These include failure of the Recovery process. The
KEL was originally written on 28 February 2010 during the Horizon Online pilot.
It explains that Recovery can fail because:
“Ifa T1 recovery request times out at the counter, recovery is abandoned
and no second attempt is made to get the recovery information. This is
as designed; it was decided to keep recovery simple and not have too
many error paths. The priority is to get the User working again, so in this
sort of error path we just mark the recovery as failed and leave it for SSC
to sort out. If it does become a frequent occurrence development could
look at this area again, but there is no obvious improvement.”
The KEL instructs Fujitsu’s MSU as to what actions to take for each
circumstance. In particular, where there is a failed Recovery, detailed checking
is required as, under one circumstance, a branch customer's bank account could
have been debited money which had not been paid to the customer. In others,
the branch customer's bank account could be correct but a loss will have been

incurred in the branch account.

Page 115 of 193
FUJ00126035

FUJ00126035

The general approach would have been for the MSU team to generate a BIMS
report so that a Transaction Correction would be issued to correct the position of
either branch or customer accounts. On occasion the MSU would also raise a

Peak so that the SSC could confirm if there were any underlying software issues.

State 4 PIN pad issues

An incident occurred in which the postmaster cancelled a banking transaction
just as the customer was entering their PIN code into the PIN pad. The result
was that, despite a cancellation receipt being produced, the customer’s bank
account was debited. Horizon produced a system error and then continued.
Peak PC0223229 was opened on 28 January 2013 (FSL_04/432). Following
investigation, it was determined that a manual reconciliation was needed to
return funds to the customer. Fujitsu’s Development team was asked to review
the incident to determine whether there was a problem which could be fixed or
whether a KEL should be raised. The Development team reproduced the
problem on 30 January 2013 and appear to have determined that it was caused
by the way the application handled error codes from the PIN pad. There was an
investigation with the Fujitsu reconciliation team to see if other examples of this
event had occurred.

The Peak does not appear to have been investigated further and the issue was

resolved during standard reconciliation processes.

Recovery failures due to printer error

During the Horizon Online pilot, a customer transaction failed to complete at the
counter, but the customer’s bank account was debited. The transaction should
have been recovered but the recovery failed. The root cause was found to be a

bug in the printing system.

FUJ00126035

Peak PC0193463 was opened on 19 January 2010 and a BIMS report was raised
with POL on 20 January 2010 so that the customer could be refunded
(FSL_04/429). The problem was reproduced on 21 January 2010 and a fixed
specified. A patch containing the tested fix was prepared on 22 January 2010.
By 3 February 2010, the fix had been tested and it was confirmed that banking
transactions would not suffer from the same issue because of printing errors. The

fix was scheduled for release and closed on 16 April 2010.

BED 9 - REVERSALS

Documents relating to Fujitsu's knowledge, rectification and communication of
this issue, including PinlICLs/Peaks and KELs, are set out in Appendix 2
(FSL_04/440 to FSL_04/443).

A code fix distributed as part of the S30 release, caused a problem under certain
circumstances due to faulty logic. On occasion, when a postmaster attempted to
‘reverse out’ a sum which had been ‘remmed in’, the balance showed double the
initial amount rather than zero. According to the April 2003 Service Review Book,
dated 15 May 2003, delivery of S30 commenced in April 2003 and by 2 May
2003, 2,135 branches were live.

The initial issue (PC0089918) was reported by a postmaster to the NBSC on 24
April 2003 (FSL_04/440). The problem was then sent to the Fujitsu SSC on 28
April 2003, who identified that an error had occurred. A KEL (PSteed2847N) was
raised (FSL_04/443). The issue was also routed to the Fujitsu MSU team so that
they could liaise with POL, who would then issue Transaction Corrections to
rectify the accounts, following which the Peak was to be routed back to Fujitsu
so that Development could produce a code fix.

On 30 April 2003, the Fujitsu EPOSS Development team identified the coding
error, and that it had been released with S30. An emergency fix was created,
tested, and went live on 7 May 2003. Instructions for testers detailed how the fix
was to be tested, to make sure that both the new problem and the original

problem which S30 aimed to fix had been fixed.

BED 10 —- DATA TREE BUILD FAILURES — ISSUE 1

Documents relating to Fujitsu's knowledge, rectification and communication of
this issue, including PinlICLs/Peaks and KELs, are set out in Appendix 2
(FSL_04/444 to FSL_04/452).

Fujitsu understands this issue was first reported by a branch on 10 November
1999 after a discrepancy occurred in the accounts (PC0033128, FSL_04/446).
Anumber of PinlCLs for similar incidents were raised between February and May
2000 (for example, see PC0039313, FSL_04/452).

A list of cross-domain problems was presented in the monthly Service Review
Books to be discussed in the Service Review Forum with POL. The issue with
the Dungannon branch was tracked in a number of these (for example, see
FSL_04/304).

To resolve the issue, Fujitsu implemented two changes — specific diagnostics to
log a failure to build the data tree, and more error checking in the application
code. Such diagnostics were distributed to 99% of the estate by 16 May 2000
(FSL_04/446). This would allow any recurrences of the problem to be monitored.
Error checking for this issue was included in the Cl4 release, which was rolled
out to existing live counters between August and October 2000. Fujitsu monitored
the issue following the Cl4 release. In the PinICL for Dungannon (PC0033128),
Fujitsu stated on 29 November 2000 “This problem has now been on monitor
since the introduction of CSR+ and no further incidents have occurred. | have
agreed closure with Theresa Walsh (POCL) who will close the corresponding

POCL problem call’. The call was subsequently closed.

BED 10 —- DATA TREE BUILD FAILURES — ISSUE 2

Documents relating to Fujitsu’s knowledge, rectification and communication of
this issue, including PinICLs/Peaks and KELs, are set out in Appendix 2

(FSL_04/444 to FSL_04/452).

Issue 2(1) - PC0121925

Two incidents arose during testing by POL of release S80, whereby
discrepancies appeared when balancing. The two incidents were raised in test
by POL on 13 June 2005 and 4 July 2005 (FSL_04/450). A KEL was written with
a workaround should a similar incident occur in live operations, but no further
action was taken.

A fixed was released on 18 August 2005. POL re-tested the issue and closed

their own incident.

Issue 2(2) - PC0132133

In this instance, a postmaster reported a situation whereby a cash report showed
varying discrepancies over a 20-minute period, after which the discrepancy
disappeared. The postmaster was referred to Fujitsu by the NBSC.

The incident was initially raised on 10 February 2006 (FSL_04/449). Fujitsu
identified a coding error and also specified that further diagnostics be inserted
into the EPOSS application which would provide an audit log if this or a similar
problem happened again, so that reoccurrence of the problem could be
monitored.

On 24 February 2006, the Release Management Forum authorised these fixes
to be carried out. On 23 March 2006, the fixes were released in the live system.

KEL MScardifield2219S was updated accordingly (FSL_04/451).

BED 11 —- GIROBANK DISCREPANCIES — ISSUE 1

Documents relating to Fujitsu's knowledge, rectification and communication of
this issue, including PinICLs/Peaks and KELs, are set out in Appendix 2
(FSL_04/453 to FSL_04/478).

In this case, Giro transaction reversals carried out after the report cut-off time
were not included in the daily Giro report for that day, nor in the same report for
the next day. Despite this, the transaction reversals would have been recorded
correctly in the weekly office Cash Account report. In this instance, the system
was working as designed so no fix was required.

In some instances, the discrepancy was reported by Girobank to the postmaster,
who would then call Fujitsu or POL through the Helpline, for example, PinlICLs
PC0044101 (FSL_04/456) and PC0050418 (FSL_04/460), whereas in other
instances, the issues were discovered by the postmaster, for example PinICL

PC0040754 (FSL_04/457).

° The same Giro deposit was included on two successive daily reports as a result
of being committed during a particular window of time on a shared stock unit. It
was noticed by Fujitsu while investigating BED 11, Issue 1 above, and a fix was
applied to prevent reoccurrence. This appears to be another instance of the bug
recorded in incident PC0052575, which is included in BED 11, Issue 3 below
(FSL_04/465).

e The issue was fixed by new ReportProcessor, ReportBroker and DataServer
files, and Fujitsu released the fix between 30 May and 23 June 2000

(FSL_04/474).

(FSL_04/474) was opened and by 2 August 2001, Fujitsu had reproduced the
bug and identified the code fix required. The fix had been coded and tested by

21 December 2001.

(FSL_04/453 to FSL_04/478).

Fujitsu understands this related to differences between the daily Giro report and
the office daily report.

A postmaster initially raised a problem on 9 April 2002 and incident PC0075312
was raised on 10 April 2002 (FSL_04/475). It was investigated, and identified
that the same problem, but relating to National Savings reports, had been
previously raised in incident PC0073855 (FSL_04/477), which was being
investigated by the Fujitsu development team. Incident PC0075312 was closed
on 10 April 2002. PC0073855 subsequently investigated both this problem and
the related National Savings problem.

Diagnostics were put in place to ensure any future occurrence could be

investigated in detail. KEL DRowe440r was also logged (FSL_04/478).

. Incident PC0076065 (FSL_04/476) was opened on 9 May 2002 after a call from
the postmaster. Fujitsu investigated the issue on the same day by reviewing the
message store and concluded that the postmaster had printed the report twice,
once before the transactions had been carried out, and once after. This situation

was explained to the postmaster.

BED 12 - COUNTER REPLACEMENT — ISSUE 1

Documents relating to Fujitsu’s knowledge, rectification and communication of
this issue, including PinlICLs/Peaks and KELs, are set out in Appendix 2
(FSL_04/479 to FSL_04/491).

Fujitsu’s solution to POL’s requirements 820 and 832 (schedule A.16 of the
Codified Agreement) used automatic replication of data between counter servers
in a branch, or between a counter and the central correspondence server, to
ensure “recovery without operator intervention” in the case of a local failure. If an
engineer replaced a counter server, the system was intended to automatically
replicate data back to this new hardware without loss of transactions. On
occasion when a replacement took place, the server came out of recovery mode
before replication was complete, resulting in a small number of messages being
overwritten. Depending on what was overwritten, this may have stalled the
upload of data to central servers from the branch or might result in lost
transactions and a receipts and payments mismatch in the branch accounts.
The problem first appears to have been recognised in incident PC0051255,
which was opened on 27 July 2000 (FSL_04/480). In this instance, the branch
had not “polled” (uploaded data to the central systems). By 1 August 2000,
Fujitsu reported that the branch message store had been inspected and the
cause had been tracked to missing messages. The issue was passed to Fujitsu’s
4" line support, who suspected it was caused by a counter server replacement.
Fujitsu then checked the message logs, and it was confirmed that a counter
replacement had taken place.

The problem was seen again independently during release testing on 21 August

2000 and incident PC0052823 was raised (FSL_04/483).

Page 127 of 193
FUJ00126035

FUJ00126035

Fujitsu discussed the fix to incident PC0052823 with POL at a Release
Management Forum on 20 December 2000 (FSL_04/305). On 9 September
2002, the incident PC0052823 was closed after a successful retest.

During the period in which incident PC0052823 was being investigated and fixes
designed, a number of other incidents including PC0064574 (FSL_04/486) were
raised because of live incidents of this problem which caused receipts and
payments mismatches in branch accounts. When an incident caused receipts
and payments mismatches, the Fujitsu MSU team generally liaised with POL
through the reconciliation process to balance accounts.

Fujitsu were also in communication with POL’s Problem Manager for PC0064574
(Ed Jones) (FSL_04/486). In addition, the issue was referenced in Service
Review Books on 17 April 2001 and 15 May 2001 which record “PC0064574,
raised 29/03/01 - PM - Hard drive swaps - R&P misbalance” (FSL_04/306 and

FSL_04/307).

(FSL_04/479 to FSL_04/491).

The issue was identified through the standard reconciliation process on 23 March
2006 (PC0133822, FSL_04/487). This issue occurred because messages were
missing at the counter server in a branch though they were present on the central
correspondence server. The problem occurred when the branch was
reconfigured from being a three-counter branch to a single counter branch, and
the root cause appears to have been that the engineer failed initially to install a
“mirror” (backup) server for the single counter.

By 27 March 2006, Fujitsu had identified the cause and impact of the problem,
which was resolved through the standard process of issuing a BIMS report to

POL so that a transaction correction could be issued by POL.

BED 12 - COUNTER REPLACEMENT — ISSUE 3

Documents relating to Fujitsu's knowledge, rectification and communication of
this issue, including PinlICLs/Peaks and KELs, are set out in Appendix 2
(FSL_04/479 to FSL_04/491).

Fujitsu’s records indicate this issue arose in one branch and occurred due to a
system problem. A report incorrectly showed a receipts and payments mismatch,
though there was no underlying discrepancy in the accounts.

The issue was identified through standard monitoring on 31 January 2008 and a
Peak (PC0153660, FSL_04/490) was opened on 1 February 2008. By 4
February 2008, Fujitsu had investigated the counter messages and determined
the cause, which appears to have been a synchronisation issue between two
counters which caused a report to show the wrong information. It was determined
that there was no underlying impact on the accounts.

On 7 February 2008, the postmaster separately reported the issue to the NBSC,
which then routed the incident to Fujitsu, resulting in a further Peak (PC0153851,
FSL_04/489). Fujitsu confirmed: “This has already been investigated
(PC0153660) because the counter daily reconciliation showed up a problem.
Caused by Riposte failing to index four messages. PC0153660 has been
updated with information to be passed to POL”. Fujitsu spoke with the postmaster
and monitored the issue until the branch rolled into the next trading period. Both

calls were subsequently closed and a final BIMS report was issued to POL.

Documents relating to Fujitsu’s knowledge, rectification and communication of
this issue, including PinlICLs/Peaks and KELs, are set out in Appendix 2
(FSL_04/492 to FSL_04/499).

An issue occurred when a postmaster declared they held stock of a product that
had been withdrawn by POL.

The issue manifested in the live system at a branch concerning £5 savings
stamps which had been withdrawn by POL. NBSC raised the incident with Fujitsu
on 19 January 2011 (PC0207834, FSL_04/494). By 11 February 2011, an
investigation under incident PCO0207834 had been carried out to identify all
branches impacted by the withdrawn stock problem. On 2 March 2011, it was
confirmed that the “NBSC have actioned the workaround successfully’.

By 1 April 2011, it was confirmed that a code fix for this issue would be delivered
to prevent any recurrences. Further, as set out in incident PC0209602
(FSL_04/497), user interface changes were made to ensure withdrawn products

did not appear as options when a counter clerk was making stock declarations.

Documents relating to Fujitsu's knowledge, rectification and communication of
this issue, including PinlICLs/Peaks and KELs, are set out in Appendix 2
(FSL_04/500 to FSL_04/503).

A discrepancy in branch accounts occurred when a network disconnection took
place halfway through a transaction to sell a customer a basket with two different
currencies. The total amount for both currencies appeared in the branch
accounts, but only the order for the first currency was received by the currency
provider.

Peak PC0261541 (FSL_04/502) was first raised to Fujitsu on 17 August 2017
after the issue had occurred in a branch. By 18 August 2017, Fujitsu identified
that the problem occurred after a communications timeout. By 23 August 2017,
Fujitsu had identified that the problem related to an AP-ACD script. POL was
informed so that the discrepancy could be remedied through a transaction
correction. On 24 August 2017, Atos, who were responsible for maintenance of
the script on behalf of POL, were informed of the problem and the changes

required.

Documents relating to Fujitsu’s knowledge, rectification and communication of
this issue, including PinlICLs/Peaks and KELs, are set out in Appendix 2
(FSL_04/500 to FSL_04/503).

A discrepancy arose between the foreign currency amount for Euros and US
Dollars recorded in Horizon at one branch, and the amounts which POL’s back-
office system (POLSAP) calculated that the branch was holding. The impact on
the branch was that the request to replenish Euros and US Dollars were refused,
so the branch could not make sales.

The incident appears to have been initially raised with Fujitsu on 19 December
2017 in PC0265443 (FSL_04/501). The investigation involved four parties, POL
(as the interface with the branch), Atos (overall service manager/problem
manager), Fujitsu (provider of the Horizon system), Accenture (provider of the
POLSAP system). The Peak also noted that “The comparison of data between
Fujitsu and Accenture identified no discrepancies and the visit to the branch by
a POL trainer confirmed that the branch holdings matches the figures held in
Horizon”.

It was agreed that the incident was outside Fujitsu’s remit, specifically the MMBE
Files for US Dollars and Euros which was agreed to be dealt with by Atos and

Accenture. The Peak was subsequently closed in May 2018.

(FSL_04/504 to FSL_04/509).

A postmaster raised a call concerning transactions which appeared without the
branch staff knowingly processing them, or which appeared in error when
another transaction was processed. Other issues such as hardware problems
were also reported.

Peak PC0063755 (FSL_04/506) was opened on 12 March 2001. Two other
Peaks were opened for later calls (PC0064809, FSL_04/507 and PC0064922,
FSL_04/508). A master Peak (PC0065021, FSL_04/509) was opened on 13
June 2001 and records numerous calls from the postmaster raising issues. The
Peak describes the action taken to identify the root cause of the issue. In addition,
an engineer from ROMEC (a company contracted by POL) visited the branch.
The master Peak (PC0065021) was closed in November 2001 concluding:
“Phantom Txns have not been proven in circumstances which preclude user
error. In all cases where these have occurred a user error related cause can be

attributed to the phenomenon.”

Fujitsu indicated that the transactions were in a suspended session and were not
completed when the user was logged out after a period of inactivity. The system
was designed to complete such transactions and print the receipt to evidence
this. The situation was explained to the postmaster, and it was agreed that the

incident could be closed.

reported that there were differences between the icons displayed on the two
counters at the branch. The second counter had not yet received the latest
Riposte release. It would have been automatically upgraded in due course, but
Fujitsu upgraded the second counter sooner to bring it up to date with the other

counter.

this issue, including PinICLs/Peaks and KELs, are set out in Appendix 2
(FSL_04/446 and FSL_04/510 to FSL_04/524)

This issue related to a report that identified any mismatches in relation to the
Cash Account. An issue with the code meant, in the event of a particular
sequence of operations being carried out by the postmaster, it would cause
transactions to be brought forward from the previous week's Cash Account.

The problem was initially flagged through Fujitsu’s monitoring in PinICL
PC0039832 (FSL_04/516, later cloned to PC0040243 (FSL_04/511)), which was
opened on 3 March 2000. By 9 March 2000, it had been investigated and Fujitsu
suspected it was an issue with the reconciliation reporting. It was flagged for a
rapid fix as it impacted financial reconciliation. By 10 April 2000, the problem had
been reproduced and the area of code which caused it had been identified. By
18 April 2000, a fix appears to have been tested, which later went live in July
2000.

Two other PiniCLs were raised (PC0044966 and PC0045529) and were found
to be instances of the same problem which occurred before the fix went live

(FSL_04/510 and FSL_04/513).

this issue, including PinlICLs/Peaks and KELs, are set out in Appendix 2
(FSL_04/446 and FSL_04/510 to FSL_04/524)

The problem was flagged to the Fujitsu SSC as a result of monitoring reports in
two separate PinICLs in April 2002 (PC0075240, FSL_04/518 and PC0075415,
FSL_04/520).

SSC investigated both problems and by 30 April 2002, they found that a rounding
error in the reporting code caused entries of £0.01 in the cash account to be
ignored in a reconciliation report, causing spurious discrepancies to be flagged.
It was originally fixed on 11 June 2002 and the fix went live on 19 June 2002.
The fix (which encompassed other issues) was found to be causing the
reconciliation report process to run very slowly, so the fix was withdrawn,

redelivered on 12 July 2002, and went live on 28 August 2002.

° The issue (PC0049578, FSL_04/514) occurred in a test system in around July
2000 and was flagged by POL’s test team to the Horizon helpdesk, who
ultimately passed the issue to the SSC. In this instance, there was a difference
between the number of files recorded as being transferred to TIP and the number
of files actually transferred.

e The Fujitsu development team investigated the issue. The problem was fixed by
installing WP104 into the live estate on 11 August 2000. Fujitsu confirmed that
the problem was corrected following the application of WP104 and subsequently

closed the call.

A single incident caused by an issue described above (BED 10 - Data Tree Build
Failure Discrepancies — Issue 1) meant a reconciliation report falsely flagged a
discrepancy in the cash account. PC0045847 (FSL_04/515) was opened on 26
May 2000 as a discrepancy was shown for a branch which had just been
migrated successfully. By 5 June 2000, Fujitsu had identified the cause as being
a failure to record the correct totals during rollover.

After investigation of the logs, it was established that there was a corruption of
the message store when this incident occurred. By 11 August 2000, it was
confirmed that this was a specific instance of the lack of Riposte error checking
which caused BED 10 - Data Tree Build Failure Discrepancies — Issue 1, and
would be fixed when the fix for that bug went live. The PinICL was closed on 14

August 2000.

this issue, including PinlICLs/Peaks and KELs, are set out in Appendix 2
(FSL_04/446 and FSL_04/510 to FSL_04/524)

This issue related to the Client Transaction Summary (CTS) file, which was sent
from branch accounts and delivered to POL’s back-office systems. Under certain
circumstances, due to a coding error, data was missing from the CTS file but
present in Client Files that were also sent to POL’s back-office systems, causing
a discrepancy to be registered in POL’s back-office system (POLSAP).

POL’s Client Settlement and Accounts Payable team initially found a discrepancy
between CTS and Client Files produced in August 2014 and raised the issue with
Fujitsu, who raised Peak PC0236246 (FSL_04/523).

Fujitsu’s SSC investigated the issue and passed it on to Fujitsu’s development
team. On 18 September 2014, Fujitsu’s Development team produced a
hypothesis as to why the problem was occurring, which was that it related to new
products that had start times which were not midnight. On 19 September 2014,
the hypothesis was validated, and a fix proposed. Updates regarding the
resolution and fix were provided to Atos in their role as operational service
manager.

A KEL (AllenD44311) was written to describe the problem if it reoccurred before
the fix went live (FSL_04/524).

The fix was written, tested and integrated by 8 October 2014. The fix went live
on 4 December 2014 via an operational change (MSC) and was later

incorporated in a standard release.

° This was an incident where customer was charged by their bank although the
transaction was not recorded by Horizon because the counter crashed while
attempting the transaction. Fujitsu detected the problem transaction via the
automated NB102 report, where it appeared as a state 4 transaction (an
incomplete transaction). The report resulted in the creation of Peak PC0156174
(FSL_04/525) in March 2008.

e Fujitsu contacted the branch to advise the postmaster on the recovery processes

and later that day, a BIMS report was issued to POL to rectify the issue.

Documents relating to Fujitsu's knowledge, rectification and communication of
this issue, including PinlICLs/Peaks and KELs, are set out in Appendix 2
(FSL_04/527 to FSL_04/531).

Issue 1 related to a single user being able to log into Horizon at two counters at
the same time, which the system should not have allowed.

PiniCL PC0027581 (FSL_04/531) was raised on 9 July 1999, after a postmaster
reported to the NBSC that he had been able to log on to two counters at the same
time. By 13 July 1999, Fujitsu confirmed that the Riposte message store seemed
to show that the postmaster had been logged on two counters simultaneously.
The diagnosis and resolution of the issue was passed between Fujitsu team
members, and during this time, NBSC made contact with Fujitsu to confirm the
status of the incident.

On 3 November 1999, Fujitsu attempted to reproduce the problem and found it
could be reproduced. Following this, there was discussion as to whether the
issue was of sufficiently high priority to fix at that time. On 2 February 2000, the
priority of the incident was raised and the team responsible for Escher
investigated. On 25 May 2000, Fujitsu appears to have raised the issue with
Escher. Escher released a new version of Riposte on 15 September 2000, which
was meant to include a fix for this issue. However, a further test on 27 September
2000 demonstrated that the issue had not been rectified.

On 11 October 2000, Escher stated that Riposte logins were working as
designed. In or around June or July 2001, it appears that it was decided that

Fujitsu’s EPOSS team would implement a workaround for the issue.

BED 18 - CONCURRENT LOGINS — ISSUE 2

Documents relating to Fujitsu's knowledge, rectification and communication of
this issue, including PinlICLs/Peaks and KELs, are set out in Appendix 2
(FSL_04/527 to FSL_04/531).

Issue 2 concerned a receipts and payments mismatch that occurred due to a
coding issue, which permitted a postmaster to transfer money from one counter
to another while the first counter was being rolled over. The system should have
prevented postmasters from undertaking a transfer in these circumstances.

The incident was raised with Fujitsu on 24 July 2000 (PinICL PC0051327)
(FSL_04/529). By 28 July 2000, Fujitsu had established what had happened after
discussing the circumstances with the postmaster and confirmed that the
postmaster should not have been effectively able to log into two counters with
the same user identification number. On 1 August 2000, a further incident (PinICL
PC0051485) was recorded as another instance of the same issue (FSL_04/528).
A number of detailed analyses were carried out, with an interim diagnosis of why
it occurred on 4 October 2000. By 22 November 2000, Fujitsu determined that
this was a transient bug caused by two modules in the application using different
methods to communicate with one another. It was further determined that an

earlier release (known as C145) should have already fixed the issue.

BED 19 — Post and Go TA Discrepancies in POLSAP

Documents relating to Fujitsu’s knowledge, rectification and communication of
this issue, including PinlCLs/Peaks and KELs, are set out in Appendix 2
(FSL_04/532 to FSL_04/534).

The issue concerned Post Office branches that had installed Post & Go
terminals, which were independent of Horizon, that Fujitsu understands allowed
branch customers to pay for and print postage labels automatically.
Postmasters had to manually input data from the Post & Go terminals into
Horizon. This process was automated as part of Release 2 of HNG-X by taking
the data from various terminals and kiosks (including the Post & Go terminal) and
submitting the data in a Transaction Acknowledgement message. If the
postmaster accepted this Transaction Acknowledgement message, the data
would be automatically inputted into Horizon.

The issue occurred in certain circumstances if a Post & Go terminal was only
used for non-cash transactions. Due to a design flaw, Transaction
Acknowledgement messages would not be sent in these circumstances,
affecting the reporting of data from Horizon to POL’s POLSAP system.

On 13 June 2012, Peak PC0281702 (FSL_04/534) was raised by Fujitsu at
POL’s request after the issue was identified by POL’s POLSAP system. The
incident occurred at the Brent Cross branch, and it appears that Fujitsu and POL
were already aware of a similar incident at the Ludgate Circus branch, which had
been diagnosed as due to use of the Post & Go terminal for non-cash
transactions. It was agreed that the immediate issue would be fixed by a
Managed Service Change to run a script to generate the necessary Transaction

Acknowledgement messages.

Page 147 of 193
FUJ00126035
FUJ00126035

On 18 June 2012, the changes required for a fix were identified.

On 29 August 2012, Peak PC0220393 (FSL_04/533) was raised by Fujitsu after
the POL POLSAP team requested further investigation. By 31 August 2012,
Fujitsu determined that the cause of the incident was the same as for Peak
PC0281702 (FSL_04/534), and that the immediate issue could be fixed via a
Managed Service Change. Fujitsu recommended POL monitor a certain report
(known as a “SubFileOnHold” report) to check for other instances of the issue
(FSL_04/533).

The fix was released on 17 December 2012.

Documents relating to Fujitsu's knowledge, rectification and communication of
this issue, including PinlICLs/Peaks and KELs, are set out in Appendix 2
(FSL_04/535 to FSL_04/543).

Issue 1 concerned two Peaks relating to an account discrepancy at a Post Office
branch.

On 13 January 2012, the first Peak (PC0214982, FSL_04/536) was raised by
Fujitsu after a postmaster reported that a discrepancy in their branch accounts
had occurred after a counter was replaced at their branch. Fujitsu investigated
the incident and found that discrepancies existed before the counter had been
swapped, and asked NBSC to investigate further by going through the branch’s
account transactions.

On 5 September 2012, a second Peak (PC0220532, FSL_04/537) was raised
after the same postmaster reported that they believed their discrepancy was
caused by the failed counter. Fujitsu noted: “/f further investigation by Fujitsu is
required, Post Office will have to request that the branch transaction data is
retrieved from the audit server’. Otherwise, the issue should be passed back to

POL for reconciliation.

BED 20 —- RECOVERY FAILURES — ISSUE 2

Documents relating to Fujitsu's knowledge, rectification and communication of
this issue, including PinlICLs/Peaks and KELs, are set out in Appendix 2
(FSL_04/535 to FSL_04/543).

Issue 2 concerned a coding error that affected branch counters. When a counter
failed before a transaction paid with a debit card had completed, upon restart the
counter would become stuck in a loop trying to recover, which rendered the
counter unusable. The issue was caused by a loop in a POL supplied AP-ACD
script, the root cause of which was an error in the Horizon code.

Fujitsu became aware of this issue during testing. Peak PC0239846
(FSL_04/542) was raised on 19 December 2014 to investigate the root cause for
the counters becoming stuck in a loop. On 22 December 2014, the Development
team carried out an initial analysis, and determined a potential workaround to
stop the POL script looping. This was emailed to POL on 23 December 2014.

In January 2015, a further analysis was carried out by Fujitsu and a code fix was
recommended as the bug could have an impact on trading. By 27 February 2015,
it appears that the code changes required had been completed and initial testing
had been passed.

On 23 February 2015, two Peaks were raised with Fujitsu concerning live
instances of the issue:

a. Peak PC0241216 (FSL_04/540) was raised as the recovery failure
issue had occurred at a branch whilst a banking and a health lottery
transaction were being processed. By 9 March 2015, Fujitsu tested
and confirmed that the issue would be fixed by the code fix relating to

PC0239846 (FSL_04/542) and the incident was closed.

Page 150 of 193
FUJ00126035
FUJ00126035

b. Peak PC0241242 (FSL_04/539) was raised at a branch where a
counter was stuck in a loop processing a health lottery transaction.
Fujitsu identified that the issue was the same as PC0241216
(FSL_04/540). On 24 February 2015, Fujitsu recommended that the
stuck transaction be deleted, and that they needed authorisation from
POL to do this as the transaction was a financial transaction
(FSL_04/539).
. In March 2015, Fujitsu, POL and Atos exchanged emails concerning the issue
(FSL_04/308)

° In May 2015, final testing was carried out and the fix released.

° Issue 3 concerned a one-off reconciliation exception incident. Peak PC0197643
(FSL_04/535) was raised by Fujitsu on 13 April 2010 after reconciliation
procedures identified a discrepancy. There was a counter timeout issue;
however, there was no evidence identified at the time that the timeout issue or
recovery caused the incident to occur. It was noted that the incident may have
been due to user error. The discrepancy was rectified in line with standard

reconciliation procedures by Fujitsu issuing a BIMS report to POL.

(FSL_04/544 to FSL_04/559).

° Issue 1 involved four incidents that were raised by either Fujitsu or POL during
system and integration testing of Release S80 between January and May 2005.
Peaks PC0114154 (FSL_04/545) and PC0120459 (FSL_04/546) were raised by
Fujitsu, and Peak PC0121331 (FSL_04/547) was raised by POL. All four
incidents related to the display of buttons on the transaction correction
processing screen in the counter application and did not relate to the live system.

e All four incidents were investigated and resolved by application of a code fix by

Fujitsu by June 2005.

BED 21 —- TRANSACTION CORRECTION ISSUES — ISSUE 2

Documents relating to Fujitsu's knowledge, rectification and communication of
this issue, including PinlICLs/Peaks and KELs, are set out in Appendix 2
(FSL_04/544 to FSL_04/559).

Issue 2 occurred when a Transaction Correction message issued by POL to a
branch through Horizon contained a long sequence of characters with no spaces.
Due to a coding error, these types of Transaction Correction messages would
cause the counter application to freeze. This would in turn prevent the branch
from processing the Transaction Correction and, as a consequence of the
outstanding Transaction Correction, prevent the branch from being able to
rollover the branch accounts at the end of the relevant trading period.

On 1 December 2005, the issue was reported to Fujitsu after a postmaster
reported that their counter hung while attempting to process a Transaction
Correction. Peak PC0129587 (FSL_04/555) was raised as a result. The issue
led to a number of Peaks, including PC0129774 (FSL_04/548) and PC0130057
(FSL_04/551).

On 6 December 2005, Fujitsu was able to reproduce the issue by using the
message store from the counter. That day, the issue was passed to the
Development team, which discovered the bug.

On 7 December 2005, the Development team created a fix and proposed a
workaround to allow postmasters to continue until the fix was rolled out. Fujitsu
also identified six other branches which were affected by the issue and planned

to contact them to tell them how to handle it.

Page 154 of 193
FUJ00126035
FUJ00126035

On 8 December 2005, Fujitsu notified POL of the problem and recommended
that Transaction Correction messages be produced without long strings of
characters.

In December 2005, the fix was tested and released to one of the affected
branches so that they could attempt to rollover to the next trading period, and the
branch confirmed the rollover had been successful. In January 2006, the fix was
put on general release to the live estate and several offices used it to process

Transaction Corrections and complete rollover.

BED 21 —- TRANSACTION CORRECTION ISSUES — ISSUE 3

Documents relating to Fujitsu's knowledge, rectification and communication of
this issue, including PinlICLs/Peaks and KELs, are set out in Appendix 2
(FSL_04/544 to FSL_04/559).

Issue 3 concerned a reporting issue relating to Transaction Corrections that was
caused by a disparity between the time period for which a postmaster could
request a Processed Transaction Correction report on the system, and the time
period for which records were held in the branch database.

The Processed Transaction Correction report provided postmasters with a list of
Transaction Corrections that had been processed over a certain time period. The
reporting function on the system indicated that postmasters could request a
report of Transaction Corrections that had been processed up to two months
prior. However, the underlying database only stored Transaction Corrections in
the branch records for 40 days. Consequently, Transaction Corrections that had
been processed more than 40 days before the date of producing the report would
not be displayed, even though the postmaster had selected a time period of more
than 40 days prior.

On 14 September 2010, the issue was reported to Fujitsu by the NBSC and Peak
PC0204350 (FSL_04/557) was raised. A postmaster was trying to understand a
cash loss in their account and had tried to review all Transaction Corrections that
had been processed in the last two months. The postmaster had accepted
Transaction Corrections in July (within the two-month time range); however,
these Transaction Corrections did not appear on the report.

On 20 October 2010, after obtaining further information from the postmaster, the

SSC determined that Transaction Correction records were only kept in the

Page 156 of 193
FUJ00126035
FUJ00126035

branch database for 40 days and passed the issue to the Development team. In
October 2010, the Development team investigated and rectified the issue by
changing the relevant database so that it retained records for two months.

KEL obengc2336R (FSL_04/558) was recorded to ensure that if the situation

arose again, postmasters could be advised.

(FSL_04/560 to FSL_04/565).

° In this incident (PC0053160) if incorrect keys were pressed while generating a
report, the screen could freeze (FSL_04/562). This was identified in August 2000
by a Fujitsu tester, testing a future release. Tests were carried out to see if the
problem could arise in the live system. Fujitsu considered that while the issue
had occurred on a training counter, the issue could occur in the live system. It
was established that the root cause was a problem which had already been

identified in earlier PiniCLs and was resolved in the M1 release.

BED 22 —- BUGS INTRODUCED BY PEAK FIXES — ISSUE 2

Documents relating to Fujitsu's knowledge, rectification and communication of
this issue, including PinlICLs/Peaks and KELs, are set out in Appendix 2
(FSL_04/560 to FSL_04/565).

Issue 2 concerned a software bug that was introduced by a previously applied fix
to another Peak. The issue was revealed by a cash account discrepancy, which
was reported by a postmaster, relating to the declaration and recording of
cheques.

On 13 January 2004, the postmaster reported the issue to the NBSC and Peak
PC0098230 (FSL_04/565) was raised. The call was passed on to the SSC. On
14 January 2004, the SSC spoke with the postmaster to understand and
diagnose the issue. The SSC determined that the discrepancy had occurred as
there had been a recent change to the EPOSS code, and the postmaster had
been using non-standard procedures when accounting for cheques. The
postmaster’s procedure had worked before the change to the EPOSS code (i.e.,
it did not cause cash account discrepancies); however, following the change to
the EPOSS code, the postmaster’s process now caused a discrepancy.

On 15 January 2004, it was confirmed that the postmaster’s accounts had
balanced, and Fujitsu advised the postmaster of the correct procedures when
accounting for cheques and spoke with a POL auditor who was on site with the
postmaster. KEL AChambers2258K was recorded (FSL_04/564).

On 16 January 2004, the Development team identified the code error was a fix
for previous PiniCL PC0097081 (FSL_04/563). On 19 January 2004, the Peak

noted that information concerning the bug was to be passed onto POL.

Page 159 of 193
FUJ00126035
FUJ00126035

On 20 January 2004, the Development team determined that the issue could
occur in other circumstances and could potentially cause other issues. The fix

was developed, tested and released on or around 5 March 2004.

BED 23 - BUREAU DE CHANGE — ISSUE 1

Documents relating to Fujitsu’s knowledge, rectification and communication of
this issue, including PinICLs/Peaks and KELs, are set out in Appendix 2
(FSL_04/566 to FSL_04/582).

Issues 1 concerned incidents relating to Bureau de Change that resulted in
discrepancies in three separate Post Office branches.

On 6 December 2005, Peak PC0129767 (FSL_04/567) was raised after a
postmaster wrote to “Subpostmaster Magazine” about an issue they experienced
when reversing a foreign currency transaction. Fujitsu investigated the issue and
determined Horizon was working as designed, and the postmaster had
misunderstood how to reverse the foreign currency transaction. Fujitsu
determined that improvements in the associated user documentation provided
by POL to postmasters could potentially improve their understanding of the
matter. KEL AChambers2252R (FSL_04/566) was recorded to describe the
issue and its resolution.

On 10 July 2006, the issue arose again at another Post Office branch and was
resolved the same day on the basis of the KEL (Peak PC0137437)

(FSL_04/568).

° Issue 2 concerned an incident relating to Bureau de Change that resulted in
discrepancies in three separate Post Office branches.

° On 29 November 2007, a Peak was raised (PC0151787, FSL_04/569). On 3
December 2007, following its investigation, Fujitsu determined that the
discrepancy was caused due to incorrect cash account declarations. Fujitsu

informed second line support at the NBSC concerning the issue.

BED 23 - BUREAU DE CHANGE — ISSUE 3

Documents relating to Fujitsu’s knowledge, rectification and communication of
this issue, including PinICLs/Peaks and KELs, are set out in Appendix 2
(FSL_04/566 to FSL_04/582).
Issue 3 related to various incidents that were raised with Fujitsu in 2010 after
branches reported that Bureau de Change rates displayed on the currency rates
board did not match the rates on Horizon. The incorrect rates displayed on the
currency rates board did not affect the rates used by Horizon for transactions
when currency was sold.
On 10 June 2010, Fujitsu’s quality centre identified that rates were being
inconsistently displayed during build testing. Peak PC0200042 (FSL_04/578)
was raised in response. On 11 June 2010, a postmaster reported a similar issue
and Peak PC0200090 (FSL_04/576) was raised. Further Peaks were raised
relating to the issue following further reports from postmasters, which were
received via the NBSC, including Peak PC0200399 (FSL_04/573), Peak
PC0200435 (FSL_04/572) and Peak PC0201340 (FSL_04/574). Following
investigations undertaken by Fujitsu, it was found that the issue occurred when:
a. the currency rates board did not display the same number of
significant figures in decimals as the Horizon counter application; or
b. | when some, but not all, Post Office branch counters were migrated to
HNG-X from Legacy Horizon (which occurred in one instance and
affected one branch).
The issue in the counter code was diagnosed and a fix proposed by 14 June

2010. The fix was produced in accordance with the development lifecycle and

Page 164 of 193
FUJ00126035
FUJ00126035

released in September 2010. Where the issue related to counter migration,
Fujitsu arranged for the affected counter to be migrated to HNG-X.

Four KELs were recorded in relation to the issue: obengc5443L (FSL_04/575),
obengc4026R (FSL_04/577), Agnihotriv245L (FSL_04/571) and AgnihotriV917N

(FSL_04/570). KEL Agnihotriv245L noted that the issue was a bug in the code.

BED 24 - WRONG BRANCH CUSTOMER CHANGE

Documents relating to Fujitsu’s knowledge, rectification and communication of
this issue, including PinICLs/Peaks and KELs, are set out in Appendix 2
(FSL_04/583 to FSL_04/588).

The ‘Wrong Branch Customer Change Displayed’ issue related to Smartpost
transactions. When carrying out Smartpost transactions for cash, the Horizon
system calculated the change due to customers incorrectly. The issue could
impact branches by causing cash shortfalls.

The issue was reported by a postmaster, and Peak PC0128728 (FSL_04/588)
was raised on 4 November 2005. The postmaster had made several calls to
Fujitsu’s Service Desk and attempts had been made to fix the problem by
swapping out equipment, which did not rectify the issue. The issue was escalated
to the SSC, and by 9 November 2005, Fujitsu suspected there was a software-
related issue, which was confirmed with the postmaster on 10 November 2005.
The issue was escalated to the Development team, which determined that the
issue was caused by a fault in a script that was distributed as part of reference
data. By 18 November 2005, a code fix relating to the reference data was
developed, tested and released. The postmaster was informed that the code fix
had been released.

In December 2005, three further Peaks concerning the same issue were raised
by postmasters contacting Fujitsu and/or POL (PC0129791, FSL_04/587;
PC0129811, FSL_04/584; PC0129835, FSL_04/585). Upon further investigation
by Fujitsu, it was determined that due to a process error, the code fix relating to
the reference data had not been distributed to all counters. Consequently, a

correct version of the script was distributed to all counters on 7 December 2005.

BED 25 - LYCA TOP UP

Documents relating to Fujitsu's knowledge, rectification and communication of
this issue, including PinlICLs/Peaks and KELs, are set out in Appendix 2
(FSL_04/589 to FSL_04/596).
The Lyca Top Up issue was a reference data error that caused the Post Office
branch counter to crash and log the user out of the Horizon system when
attempting to process a top-up for a Lyca mobile phone account. If the
transaction was recovered, and depending on the action taken by the postmaster
after logging back into the Horizon system, the issue led to two scenarios:

a. branch accounts would show a shortfall equal to the value of the top-

up transaction amount; or
b. —areconciliation discrepancy would show in daily reconciliation reports
that were automatically produced by Horizon for POL.

A postmaster reported the issue to Fujitsu on 12 August 2010, and Fujitsu raised
Peak PC0202894 (FSL_04/595). Further Peaks were raised following further
reports from postmasters experiencing the issue and as a result of daily
reconciliation reports produced by the Horizon system, including: Peaks
PC0203108 (FSL_04/591), PC0203137 (FSL_04/590), PC0203284
(FSL_04/596) and PC0203215 (FSL_04/594). Fujitsu investigated the issue and
determined that the error occurred because of reference data that was not in the
format expected by the counter application. Two KELs were recorded describing
the issue (KEL Ballantj020J, FSL_04/592 and KEL suklabaidyas4944I,
FSL_04/589).
On 21 August 2010, Fujitsu confirmed that corrected reference data had been

validated by POL and released to the live estate. Where necessary,

Page 168 of 193
FUJ00126035
FUJ00126035

discrepancies were corrected by POL issuing a Transaction Correction in
accordance with the BIMS reconciliation process (FSL_04/309 and

FSL_04/310).

BED 26 — TPSC250 REPORT - ISSUE 1

Documents relating to Fujitsu's knowledge, rectification and communication of
this issue, including PinlICLs/Peaks and KELs, are set out in Appendix 2
(FSL_04/597 to FSL_04/621).

Issue 1 concerned a coding error that caused the TPSC250 report to display
incorrect totals for a Post Office branch when a particular ‘Smartpost’ transaction
was carried out.

The TPSC250 report was only used by Fujitsu for reconciliation purposes. The
report was not used by postmasters or POL, and the data contained in the report
was not otherwise communicated to postmasters or POL.

The issue was raised in Peak PC0115804 (FSL_04/597) on 10 February 2005,
after it was identified the TPSC250 report showed a difference in the total amount
reported to TPS and the counter. On 14 February 2005, Fujitsu commenced
investigating the issue, and determined that the issue was caused by Smartpost
transactions where a prepaid card was used to pay for postage of lower value,
and change was given to the customer. KEL AChambers253L was logged
(FSL_04/617).

Between March and July 2005, further Peaks were raised concerning the same
issue. For example, Peaks PC0117659 (FSL_04/599), PC0118350
(FSL_04/600) and PC0118677 (FSL_04/601). The Development team
investigated the matter further and determined that the underlying problem had
been discovered during testing for a forthcoming Horizon release (known as
S80), and the issue would be resolved as part of that release. Following the

release of S80, no further occurrences were noted for four years.

FUJ00126035

In October 2009, Peak PC0189625 (FSL_04/620) was raised reporting the same
issue and it was determined that KEL AChambers253L applied. It was decided
to monitor for reoccurrences of the issues rather than investigate the matter

further due to the launch of HNG-X.

BED 26 —- TPSC250 REPORT — ISSUE 2

Documents relating to Fujitsu's knowledge, rectification and communication of
this issue, including PinlICLs/Peaks and KELs, are set out in Appendix 2
(FSL_04/597 to FSL_04/621).

This issue related to an application located in Fujitsu’s data centre, which formed
part of the End of Day process that collected data from branches for transmission
to POL’s back-end systems. Due to a coding error in the application, if there were
delays in the receipt of data from Riposte, due to communications issues, the
application wrote data in the wrong format causing the End of Day process to
fail. The issue impacted Fujitsu and POL, as Fujitsu was required to manually
correct the data before it could be uploaded to POL’s accounting systems, which
caused a delay to data delivery.

On 29 June 2005, Peak PC0122544 (FSL_04/614) was raised following an alert
from the data centre as the End of Day process had failed for five branches.
Fujitsu investigated the issue and identified a marker field in the data was
incorrectly formed. Fujitsu corrected the field manually and on 30 June 2005, the
data was uploaded correctly.

In June 2005, Peaks PC0122630 (FSL_04/609) and PC0122631 (FSL_04/608)
were raised, which reported errors in the TPSC250 report for one of the branches
impacted by the End of Day process failure. KEL JAnscomb1935Q (FSL_04/607)
was recorded on 30 June 2005 in relation to the issue.

A fix was tested and released by 9 August 2005. The fix for the issue was
regressed (i.e., the previous version of the application without the fix was

reinstalled) as it was considered that the fix may have caused other issues. The

Page 172 of 193

FUJ00126035

regression was subsequently reversed when it was confirmed that the fix had not

caused such issues.

(FSL_04/618, FSL_04/619, FSL_04/621 to FSL_04/632).

The incident related to issues found in TPS reports when reconciling transactions
carried out through the Smartpost service.

The issue was identified by Fujitsu’s MSU on 14 November 2006 as part of
Fujitsu’s daily monitoring of reconciliation reports after discrepancies were
identified in the TPS reports. Peak PC0141145 (FSL_04/619) was raised as a
result, and the issue was recorded in KEL BallantJ2547K (FSL_04/621). A further
40 Peaks were identified that reference KEL BallantJ2547K, including Peak
PC0156718 (FSL_04/618).

Fujitsu investigated the issue, and by 16 November 2006, it was identified that a
message had been incorrectly formed and the issue was escalated to the
Development team. In most cases, where the issue occurred, an OCR procedure
needed to be carried out, as part of which, transaction data provided to POL’s
back-end systems was corrected.

Despite Fujitsu’s investigations, the root cause of the erroneous reporting could

not be identified. The Peak was closed on 30 September 2008.

BED 28 - DROP AND GO

Documents relating to Fujitsu's knowledge, rectification and communication of
this issue, including PinlICLs/Peaks and KELs, are set out in Appendix 2
(FSL_04/633 to FSL_04/635).

The Drop and Go issue occurred when a customer at a Post Office branch
customer topped up a “Drop and Go” pre-payment card, and the Horizon system
confirmed the top-up onto the pre-payment card despite that amount not being
transferred to back-end systems.

Peak PC0260269 (FSL_04/633) was raised with Fujitsu on 5 July 2017 by
Accenture, who were attempting to reconcile the issue in the back-end systems.
Fujitsu investigated the issue, and identified the problem was either caused by
user error or by an error in the AP-ACD script, and the incident was routed to
Atos who were responsible for script maintenance. The Peak was closed and
KEL cardce235Q (FSL_04/634) was recorded.

Another incident relating to the same issue was raised with Fujitsu on 21 August
2018 (PC0273234, FSL_04/635). Fujitsu investigated the issue that day and
confirmed the cause was lack of error checking in the AP-ACD when a timeout
had occurred. Fujitsu made POL and other parties aware of the issue in

accordance with standard incident management processes.

BED 29 —- NETWORK BANKING — ISSUE 1

Documents relating to Fujitsu's knowledge, rectification and communication of
this issue, including PinlICLs/Peaks and KELs, are set out in Appendix 2
(FSL_04/636 to FSL_04/640).

The issue concerned one Post Office branch, which experienced intermittent
network problems due to faults on its BT line. In two instances, this resulted in a
situation where authorisation from a customer’s bank account for a transaction
was delayed and the postmaster had cancelled the transaction. As a result, the
customer's money was showing as being withdrawn from their bank account, but
they had not received cash at the Post Office branch (as the money had been
ring-fenced by customer's bank).

On 1 October 2004, the postmaster at the affected branch contacted the NBSC
and the call was forwarded to Fujitsu’s first line support. The postmaster reported
that their communications line was down and that there had been issues with
their customers’ accounts. Peak PC0109020 (FSL_04/638) was raised as a
result.

Fujitsu undertook investigations in relation to the communications network at the
affected branch. Fujitsu switched the affected branch to a_ different
communications method, which appeared to resolve the network issues.

On 14 October 2004, Fujitsu asked the postmaster to carry out a “hard reboot”
of the counter at their branch. On 15 October 2004, Fujitsu investigated the root
cause of the discrepancies and determined that it was a timing issue between
the customer's bank and the counter. One of the customer transactions had
resolved itself automatically and the other transaction was provided to the MSU

for resolution through reconciliation processes.

BED 29 —- NETWORK BANKING — ISSUE 2

Documents relating to Fujitsu’s knowledge, rectification and communication of
this issue, including PinICLs/Peaks and KELs, are set out in Appendix 2
(FSL_04/636 to FSL_04/640).

The issue concerned one Post Office branch that experienced network
communication issues, which prevented them from accessing online services.
On 23 January 2007, the postmaster at the affected branch reported that they
were unable to access online services. Fujitsu raised Peak PC0142872
(FSL_04/640) and commenced investigating the issue.

On 25 January 2007, the postmaster reported that they were no longer
experiencing communications issues at their branch, and it was suspected that
severe weather in the region had been the cause. It was not reported or
otherwise identified to have impacted other Post Office branches or branch

accounts. Fujitsu continued to monitor the situation until 29 January 2007.
