Awards and External Recognition
(c) The Business had received a number of awards and recognition

over the last month. The CEO highlighted the change in attitude
and positive report from Citizen’s Advice. The report covered
the effect of Network Transformation and the value of the Post
Office to consumers and small businesses.

Branch Numbers and Technology Transformation

(e) The CEO recognised the adverse trend in branch numbers and
explained that the work underway to tighten up the cash in the
network including an increase in the number of risk based audits
had identified a few large losses and meant some branch
closures.

The CFOO believed that the work underway might find more
losses in the short term but would mean reducing the risk for the
future. The roll out if new kit in the Network was an opportunity
to audit 10% of the branches during the work. The very limited
number of audits to date had not highlighted any systemic
issues.

The announcement on new white space branches would be
made this week which would help to increase branch numbers
especially in urban areas. I

2017 was presented in the same format produced for the Board
away day, and showed a deterioration in headroom. However
the headroom remained £166m above target. The main change
had been an increase in cash in transit awaiting processing at
cash centres caused by higher inflows, work is underway to
reduce the balance be deploying additional resource.

(c) The Board asked about the renegotiation of the security rules.
The CFOO explained that discussion with Santander might
produce some helpful changes.

(d) The Board discussed agent's debt and challenged why small
branches were allowed to accumulate large amounts of cash. I
The CFOO explained that this was a complex issue reflecting I
inadequacies in systems and MI, compounded by the lack of
prosecutions and the drive to ensure trading at all branches
versus the impact of a few criminals. Work was underway to
improve the situation but would some of the solutions would
take longer to implement.

(e) The CEO explained that the decision not to prosecute agents if
they could use the Horizon system as a defence would be

ACTION: CFOO losses, including recruitment processes, be presented at
the ARC.

(g) The Board noted that Capital investment was £3.6m behind
target and asked if the Business had the capacity to deliver the

be implemented if the pilots were successful, and this had
slowed some of the investment.

ACTION: CFOO

POLB, 25 July 2017

The Chairman welcomed TW and CM to the meeting.

KG reminded the Board of the position presented at the March
2017 Board meeting with a loss of £17.8m for POca in the 5 year
plan. However recent negotiations look as if they will deliver a
saving of £24m to 2021.

The Board discussed the LIBOR position and the consideration
being given to a 3 year interest rate SWAP. RC was unsure how
the Shareholder would respond to the proposed SWAP. The
CFOO reminded the Board that the Business already uses
hedging for FOREX and fuel, and that there was no governance
requirement to obtain Shareholder approval.

The CFOO stressed that no decision on the use of SWAPs
would be taken without approval by the ARC, and offered to
take the Shareholder through the rationale if it would be
helpful.
