Dear Paula,

ENTRUSTMENT OF POST OFFICE LIMITED WITH THE DELIVERY OF
CERTAIN PUBLIC SERVICES

Commencement

This letter has effect from the later of: (i) the date on which the European
Commission confirms that the requirements of this letter are compatible with the
requirements on State Aid of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union;
and (ii) 1 April 2015 (the "Effective Date").

Existing Entrustment Letter

Notwithstanding the signing of this letter, in respect of the period prior to the
Effective Date, the provisions of the letter from the Government to Post Office
Limited entitled "Entrustment of Post Office Limited with the delivery of certain
public services" and dated 21 March 2012 (the "Existing Entrustment Letter") shall
continue in full force and effect and the provisions of this letter shall be without
prejudice to any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities of any party accrued under
the Existing Entrustment Letter.

The Existing Entrustment Letter shall be terminated on the Effective Date.
Entrustment

This letter contains an overarching ministerial instruction entrusting Post Office
Limited with the provision and delivery of certain services of general economic
interest. This instruction is legally binding on Post Office Limited and Post Office
Limited has signed this letter in agreement and acknowledgement of this.

We confirm that Post Office Limited is under a public service obligation (as set out
here and also contractually in the Post Office Limited Funding Agreement dated
26 November 2013 (the "2013 Funding Agreement")) to maintain, from the
Effective Date until the end of its financial year ending on or around 31 March 2018,
a network of post offices beyond its optimal commercial size (the "Network SGEI").
That network must number a minimum of 11,500 post offices and also meet the
following minimum access requirements:

e Nationally, 99% of the UK population to be within 3 miles and 90% of the
population to be within 1 mile of their nearest post office outlet.

« 99% of the total population in deprived urban areas across the UK to be within 1
mile of their nearest post office outlet.

POL00362169
POL00362169

POL-BSFF-0190679
« 95% of the total urban population across the UK to be within I mile of their
nearest post office outlet

e 95% of the total rural population across the UK to be within 3 miles of their
nearest post office outlet.

In addition the following criterion will apply at the level of each and every individual
postcode district, establishing a minimum level of coverage at a very local level.

¢ 95% of the population of the postcode district to be within 6 miles of their nearest
post office outlet.

Post Office Limited is required to provide this network of post office branches to
make available the services of general economic interest detailed in Annex A
("Product SGEI") on the basis set out in the 2013 Funding Agreement. This
Network SGEI obligation therefore extends the provision of the Product SGEI over a
network which may be beyond that required under individual Product SGEI contracts
entered into on a commercial basis between Post Office Limited and relevant
Government departments or bodies (whether public or private). The delivery of the
Product SGEI by Post Office Limited across its network will be governed in
accordance with contracts or other agreements under which the terms of the provision
of the individual product SGEI are specified.

The entrustment of the delivery of the Network SGEI set out in this letter to Post
Office Limited does not replace or change in any way any contracts or other
agreements under which the terms of the provision of the individual Product SGEI are
specified. Post Office Limited is expected to use reasonable endeavours to enter into
contracts with Government departments or bodies (whether public or private)
contracting with Post Office Limited in respect of the provision of one or more
Product SGEIs. A list of the current individual contracts and agreements held by Post
Office Limited to deliver the Product SGEI is provided in Annex B.

Method of Calculating Compensation

As soon as reasonably practicable following publication of its audited accounts for the
Financial Year ending on or around 31 March 2018, Post Office Limited will be
required to provide, in accordance with the 2013 Funding Agreement, a statement (the
"Cumulative SGEI Statement"). The Cumulative SGEI Statement must be
accompanied by a supporting statement from an independent financial adviser, to
confirm that the aggregate amount of the SGEI compensation payments made by the
Government to Post Office Limited under the funding agreement dated 25 October
2010 (the "2010 Funding Agreement") and the 2013 Funding Agreement (the
"Cumulative SGEI Payment") did not exceed the difference between the actual net
costs incurred by Post Office Limited and the reasonable net profits that would have
been incurred in connection with the provision of a network that Post Office Limited
would maintain on a purely commercial basis (as specified by the relevant European
Commission decision(s)), during the financial years covered by the 2010 Funding
Agreement and the 2013 Funding Agreement (the "Cumulative SGEI Cost"). The
calculation of those net costs shall include:

Page 2

POL00362169
POL00362169

POL-BSFF-0190679_0001
1. All variable costs including those incurred in providing the Network SGEI and
the Product SGEIs; plus

2. All fixed costs including those incurred in providing the Network SGEI and
the Product SGEIs; less

3. All revenues received by Post Office Limited from providing the Product
SGEIs as well as non-SGEI services.

For the purposes of the calculation above, the costs shall include, without limitation,
contributions to pension funds, interest costs, central costs, capital expenditure, costs
of any employee incentivisation arrangements and the costs of transforming the
network, in each case whether such costs are recurring or exceptional.

Recovery of Overpayment

Notwithstanding clause 5.2 of the 2013 Funding Agreement, in the event that the
Cumulative SGEI Payment exceeds the Cumulative SGEI Cost, Post Office Limited
will be required to repay to the Government, within 10 Business Days of a request
from the Government, an amount equal to such excess.

The 2010 Funding Agreement does not foresee an outcome in which the objectives
associated with the entrusted obligations under the 2010 Funding Agreement will
need to be re-phased. In the unlikely event that this occurs and a repayment from Post
Office Limited arises under the 2010 Funding Agreement, the Government waives its
right to receive any such repayment on the strict understanding that (a) the cumulative
reconciliation described in the paragraph above will be carried out and (b) any
objectives that are not achieved during the 2010 Funding Agreement will remain as
objectives under the 2013 Funding Agreement. This is in recognition of the scale and
complexity of the activities being carried out by Post Office Limited and the parties’
desire to promote the efficient use of all funds committed by the Government to Post
Office Limited under the 2010 Funding Agreement and the 2013 Funding Agreement.

It is possible that Post Office Limited may during the period of this entrustment cease
to provide an individual Product SGEI, the provision of which over the post office
network beyond its optimal commercial size is compensated by the Government. In
those circumstances, the Government shall, provided that the provision of the
Network SGEI will be maintained, withhold such proportion of that compensation (if
any) which corresponds to the net direct costs of providing that Product SGEI.

Yours sincerely,

JO SWINSON
