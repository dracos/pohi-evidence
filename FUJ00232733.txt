which continued TfSNow updates are still needed (eg. it is bonded to POL) is sent back to

Peak for the Peak to be reopened. Otherwise the, TfSNow incident will stagnate as no Peak

Fujitsu MAC. This will be added to the Friday Peak/TfS report
2. Sandie - We need to regularly check
« — that we do not reference KBAs, Peaks or include internal content in TfSNow bonded
Incidents and that the TfSNow Incident contain all relevant content and be a
comprehensive self-contained reference to the status of an Incident. The only Peak
reference that should be added is for defect Peaks (if applicable)
e Incidents are being updated and that we are not using separate emails to share
progress that is not embedded into the Incident updates
e Incident updates are well worded and use language that is understandable to most
readers — challenging and coaching where needed

the current status and the next action on an Incident is clearly stated so any reader is
in no doubt that the Incident is under full control — challenging and coaching where
needed

the Summary field is well worded and understandable by most readers

the relevant open and close categories are being used when handling Incidents —
applying additional caution with bonded Incidents to use the mutually agreed settings
the LiveAffectingDefect Cl is being set for Live Defects

the HDR* Cls are being set by Fujitsu management where applicable (and that the
POL Problem Reference is also added to the Incident)

when an Incident is placed into Suspend as no further Fujitsu action is applicable
then the text of “Please be aware that the incident will automatically, be closed after
10 days if no response is received from you.” has added. After 10 days, these
Incidents should be closed

3. Sandie/Steve Ba — create a process/report to share Incidents and Peaks closed due to
process or user issues with POL monthly to encourage POL to consider system

20. Adam — Notify the SSC team and create a process so that Peaks that are cloned that have a
ServiceNow reference cannot be closed by EDSC until the cloned Peak that was created is
also closed or has its Call Type changed to “#”. The original Peak must be kept open until the
cloned Peak is closed and updates must be applied to the original Peak so that the related
TfSNow and ServiceNow Incidents continue to receive updates. We need to agree,
implement and document a frequency for doing this. Is weekly enough? If updates are
demanded more frequently then MAC will be chasing so it will become apparent quite quickly
if higher frequency updates are needed. For Peaks cloned for GDC for GDPR obfuscation
reasons this will only apply up to April 2020 as from that date the original Peak was
obfuscated and a clone was not created

not in the presence of POL), what decisions are made

¢ Initial date - will hold the date of the first CBIF the Peak was first
presented at - this value should not change
e Completed date - will hold the last CBIF meeting the Peak was
discussed at — this value will change if the Peak is iteratively
presented for review and it will allow reporting on what was reviewed
at the last CBIF meeting

the Release Mgt tab. A concise note is all that is needed. No’need for
separate in CBIF minutes

the Developer team

= If the Peak is to be discussed next time (as POL wish to seek wider feedback
within their own organisation) then the PTF Action flag will not be set and this
will cause the Peak to reappear on the weekly report

also to the KBA so we know this was a POL decision. The Peak is then
closed with Response “63 -=,Final -- Programme approved - No fix required”
