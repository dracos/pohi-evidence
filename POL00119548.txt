Dear Ms Vennells

MR LEE CASTLETON

I refer to my letter to you dated the 14" November 2014, and the acknowledgement received from
your office (copies attached for ease of reference), and I am surprised that to date, I do not appear
to have received a detailed reply from you.

I should be grateful if you would look into this matter and let me have your response as soon as
possible please. Why are the Post Office now apparently not willing to medicate in Mr Castleton’s
case?

I look forward to receiving your reply shortly.

Yours sincerely

Dear Ms Vennells

MR LEE CASTLETON

I have been contacted by my above named constituent concerning the investigation by Second Sight,
the company appointed to conduct an independent investigation of a number of matters raised by
subpostmasters, or former subpostmasters concerning the Horizon system.

I understand that originally, the Post Office indicated they were willing to mediate with all those who
were recommended for mediation by Second Sight.

Second Sight have now recommended that Mr Castleton’s case be put forward for mediation, but he
informs me that the Post Office have told him that only they will decide and apparently all ten
subpostmasters in Mr Castleton’s group have not moved forward.

This does seem to be against the spirit of co-operation which this whole exercise was seeking to
achieve, and I should be grateful if you could let me know why the Post Office are not willing to put
forward for mediation these cases, when it has been recommended to them that they do so?

I sincerely hope the Post Office will be prepared to reconsider its position.

I look forward to receiving your reply shortly.

Yours sincerely
