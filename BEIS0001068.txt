Subject: [Commission] Briefing for SoS' attendance to POL Board Meeting and POL's
10@10
Hi all,

The SoS will be attending the POL Board Meeting next Monday (25 March) and the
10@10 all staff meeting on the Wednesday (27 March). Can we please have one
briefing pack for each event? The Board briefing will be due for noon this Friday
(22"¢ March) and the 10@10 will be due for (25 March).

For the Board meeting, a normal briefing pack with lines and speaking points will
suffice (and a bio for every board member please!), and the general sentiment should
be that she is supportive of the board, e.g. (1) they are doing great work, (2) we are
working to deliver redress at pace, which is my first priority, (3) thank you Ben for
taking up the interim-interim chair role before we appoint an actual interim chair,
which we are working very hard towards etc.

For the 10@10, she will be delivering a short speech (aiming for 3 or 4 minutes) so___
would be grateful if the briefing pack can include one. Please also loop @Kit LONG:
(DBT) in on the speech as he is our expert on SoS’ speech style!

Warmest,
Jason
