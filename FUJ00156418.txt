Penny,
Yes, I did. I was pleased that Fujitsu wasn’t mentioned. POL have a significant problem!
I also note that the screenshots were of HNG-X and not Horizon.

I remember chatting to Mr Misra outside the court!

Gareth
Hope all is well with you this afternoon.
Please see mail string.

The statement requirement for me relates to the disc which contained the xml records sent to both McLaughlan and
Juliet on 27 January, as you requested. Are you happy to incorporate the explanation of the records in your
statement? It seems the obvious route.

Kind regards
Penny

Hi Penny

I've not put this in as a request yet - I just wanted to give you the heads up and to ask if in fact the disk does differ
from the original one produced?

The office is Rinkfield and it is the disk that was sent to Juliet

Steve here are the reports received from the Defence Expert Could you take a look and let me have your views
Could you let me have an update re the Bank Deposits.

As discussed I will need two statements which I would like to serve on Thursday:
1) Statement from Penny Thomas producing the latest disc she should explain how it differs from that already
served.
2) Statement from yourself producing the relevant bank deposit slips and setting out your findings
