Summary: LST RO3.13 - Audit Extractor incorrectly reports all JSNs as duplicates for Node 2
incident Description:

lA new Slow ARQ was created to retrieve Audit Tracks for FAD 015010 which is a 2 counter outlet.
tn the “Validation and Query" tab all the JSNs for Node 2 are reported as being duplicates, see attached screen print.

It checked retrieved files for a few of the JSN's and could not find any duplicates, attached is a zipped copy of the EXTRACTED AT
folder with the Audit Tracks renamed from .audgz to .txt to allow the Windows search to be used.

iowever, this only seems to be a display problem as an output spreadsheet (from Hx IOP query) is reporting that there are no
duplicates.

[two further problems have been found which appear to be related to this problem. If this is not the case then I'm happy to raise
jadditional PEAKs.

lin the retrieved files I believe there are no Duplicates and the GAPS should be
076137 Node 1 - 63471 to 63492
Jo76137 Node 2 - 9423 to 9443

h) ARQ OTH3566B (Filtered on two multi-counter FADS, 076137 and 017632)

Validation and Query" screen displays "GAPS FOUND" but nothing is highlighted in Red.
the actual gaps are shown in Blue.

However, the majority of entries, including some for Node 1 are also shown in Blue.

2) ARO OTH3567B (Filtered on one multi-counter FAD 076137)
[fhe GAP in the Node 2 transaction sequences is high-light in Blue not Red.

lattached are zipped files foe each of the ARQs.

lA new Business Impact has been addé

[Start of Response]

[fhe problem arises when the message sequence numbers for a particular node number are lower than the message sequence numbers for
Js lower numbered node (for the same FAD code).

iere's an example from the attached evidence:
153125 153213

42848 42848
42849 42853

the two rows for node 4 are incorrectly marked as duplicates because they are being compared against the node 1 row.

the fix was tested by running filters against the message files supplied as evidence and checking that gaps and duplicates are
correctly highlighted.
