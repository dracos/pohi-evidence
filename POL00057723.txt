Steve,

Thanks for these. Your draft statement will need some amendment as it relates to

Ishaq but also refers to Dukinfield rather than Birkenshaw. I know you are juggling lots
of balls at the moment. I am about to sort out the Dukinfield Advance Disclosure. Please
do not hesitate to call if you have any questions.

Martin.

Please see attached. Statements from me, Andrew Wise (2 officer at first interview), Kevin Ryan (2?
Officer at 24 Interview) and Kath Smith (Auditor who assisted).

Also note I have been informed that Dennis Watson (Lead Auditor) has retired from the business and I
have spoken to Kath today, she says the statement is fine but is currently on long term sick.

If you wish to discuss give us a ring.

Steve
