Thanks Mark

It’s interesting that 2 of the quotes from claimants refer specifically to wanting to clear their names. For those with a
criminal record, that isn’t in our gift...

Hi Tom

Here you go https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6364901/More-500-village-Post-Office-staff-sue-
company-accused-stealing-missing-money.html

It’s easily the worst of the coverage so far (which has been more limited than I expected). The cases featured
are ones which have been covered in the past.

Cheers

Mark

Do you have a copy of (or link to) the Daily Mail piece? For some reason they don’t seem to have a search function on
the website

Dear all

This is an update on media coverage of the Group Litigation Order. Yesterday was the first day of
the trial.

After preview articles in the Financial Times, The Times and Daily Mail, representatives of those
papers were in court yesterday. This led to coverage this morning in the Mail and FT, with some
Telegraph coverage online. There were brief mentions in radio bulletins yesterday.

The coverage is largely balanced, though the focus is inevitably on the claimants’ QC’s opening
statements. The Mail is the most slanted, positioning the trial as “village postmasters” vs the
corporate PO: again this is not unexpected.

Our position is being reflected fairly in my view. We are monitoring coverage carefully and will
intervene to correct inaccuracies. The coverage is uncomfortable but not as widespread as it might
have been (and of course this could change in the weeks ahead).

We are keeping colleagues across the business up to date with developments.

I hope this is helpful. Please don’t hesitate to get in touch if you have any questions or concerns.
