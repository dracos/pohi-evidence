1.0 Introduction

1.1 Supplementary Documentation

This document supplements two (2) other Network Banking Reconciliation Service CCDs as
defined in Schedule 1 to this Agreement by providing information on the Reconciliation
Service and reconciliation and settlement reporting. In order to do this, references are
made in this document to such other Network Banking Reconciliation Service CCDs.

1.2 Document Structure

As a consequence of the interconnecting nature of the Network Banking Reconciliation CCDs
as explained in paragraph 1.1 above, the numbering in this document has assumed a particular
numbering structure. If then, as a result of Soft Change Control Procedure or otherwise, the
contents of this document are altered there may need to be consequential changes to the other
Network Banking Reconciliation Service CCDs. In order to prevent the need for such
consequential changes it is advised that in the event of changes being made to this document
the numbering is as far as possible preserved

1.3. Statement of Precedence

In the event of any conflict or ambiguity the provisions of this CCD shall take precedence over
the provisions of the following CCD’s:

e Network Banking Reconciliation & Incident Management NB/PRO/002
e¢ Network Banking End to End Reconciliation Reporting CS/SPE/011

2.0 Scope

The reconciliation and settlement reporting services for Banking Transactions (the “Data
Reconciliation Service”) are described in this paragraph 3.0.

3.0 Network Banking Data Reconciliation

3.1 Reconciliation System

3.1.1 This paragraph 3.1 describes the functionality for that part of the end-to-end
network banking reconciliation system required by which shall be developed
and operated by as part of the NBS. Such part is referred to in this as the
“Reconciliation System”. [NBR040]

3.1.5

and shall follow the reconciliation and incident management procedures
(applicable to each of them) for the investigation, reporting and resolution of
business incidents related to the NBS as set out in the CCD entitled “Network
Banking Reconciliation and Incident Management” (NB/PRO/002). [NBR041,
NBRS00, NBR504]

shall not unreasonably withhold or delay its agreement to the design of back
end processes and Banking Transaction processing procedures required to
support the reconciliation and incident management of Banking
Transactions. [NBR041, NBR495, NBR496I

Reconciliation between counter and Cash Account

Reconciliation of EPOSS Transactions to the Cash Account shall be dealt with at
summary level using the reconciliation functionality used for EPOSS as a Service
that existed prior to the introduction of Network Banking. [NBR454]. Such
reconciliation functionality shall ensure that all Banking Transactions (reflected in
Cl Confirmations) are included in the Cash Account, but shall not identify
erroneous Cash Account mappings which cause such Banking Transactions to be
included in the wrong line of the Cash Account, or non-Banking Transactions to be
included in Cash Account lines intended for Banking Transactions. Reconciliation
to the Cash Account described in this paragraph 3.1.4 will be performed after the
electronic Cash Account is produced, which will be an indeterminate time after the
Transactions have been settled (in the same manner as for Services that existed
prior to the introduction of Network Banking .

Branching data-flows

(a) The Reconciliation System shall enable reconciliation of Financial Transactions
arriving at the DRSH from the following three sources: [NBR183, NBR212,
NBR229]

(i) the Confirmation Agent (i.c. the Cl Confirmations received by the
Confirmation Agent from the Counter Position);

(ii) the NBE (i.e. D Messages and C4 Confirmations) [NBR294, NBR389];
and

(iii) the TPS Host (i.e. the C1 Confirmations harvested by the TPS Agent )

which reconciliation shall be reported by in accordance with the CCD entitled
“Network Banking End to End Reconciliation Reporting” (CS/SPE/011),

In the event that a CO Confirmation is sent to the NBE the relevant Cl
Confirmation will indicate that a CO Confirmation has been generated.

(b) The Reconciliation System shall monitor the Financial Transactions and report
Banking Transaction states which are:

(i) intrinsically anomalous, in that their occurrence implies malfunction in
End to End Banking; or

(ii) anomalous in that an expected state has persisted for an unexpected
duration (e.g. where Cl Confirmations are received from the Confirmation
Agent and C4 Confirmations are received from the NBE but the Confirmation
from the TPS Host has not been received after an abnormal delay),

identifying any such anomalous Banking Transaction states which require human
analysis for resolution. [NBR042, NBR228]

(c) The expected Banking Transaction states and Banking Transaction states
which constitute exceptions are those set out in the CCD entitled “Network
Banking End to End Reconciliation Reporting” (CS/SPE/011).

(d) The Data Reconciliation Service shall not produce reports which relate
Banking Transactions included in Cash Accounts to Banking Transactions included
in the Transaction files sent by the TPS Host to TIP, as these shall be covered by
the reconciliation reporting and processes used for EPOSS (as a Service that
existed prior to the introduction of Network Banking ) and for TIP.

3.1.6 Complete processing

(a) The Reconciliation System shall:

(i) ensure that all data received by it are processed;

(ii) check for completeness of Financial Transactions; and

(iii) report exceptions/anomalies for resolution as described in paragraphs
3.1.5 (b) and 3.1.5 (c) of this . [NBR227, NBR042]

following categories within 5 MSU Days:

(a) Priority Exceptions to which the Service Level Targets set out in Schedule 15
do not apply

entitled “Network Banking End to End Reconciliation Reporting” (CS/SPE/011).
