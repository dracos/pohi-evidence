INTRODUCTION
A quorum being present, the Chairman opened the meeting.

The CEO updated the Board on the recent challenging NFSP
conference at which she and the Minister had spoken and taken
questions. She explained that it had been helpful to attend as the
specific debate around the network model had challenged the
business to produce different solutions for the ‘small rural’ and
‘urban deprived’ branches. The reception had also made it clear
that the business needs to find a more constructive way to engage
individual subpostmasters.

GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE FUNDING AND
STRATEGY PLAN

The Board agreed the strategy and funding update and the
proposed delegated authorities for the Board’s Funding Sub-
Committee. It was agreed that delegated authority levels for
