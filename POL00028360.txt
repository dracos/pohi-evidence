        Summary of Overall Position

        1. Position at end of last Acceptance workshop on 10 August (Recognised by ICL
           Pathway).
           The last of the 3 acceptance incident meetings between POCL and ICL Pathway
           concluded with the POCL Hotlist containing:

           Disputed Acceptance Incidents:
                8 High      (one of these 376, was previously agreed as high)
                2 High/Medium
               12 Medium (two of these were previously agreed medium)
               22

          However, a lot of work was due to be complete during 11 August, and a revised
          position is now proposed by POCL.

        2. Results of work on 11 August
           The POCL review of the actions today has concluded that of the disputed
           acceptance incidents

        Chanties POCL would accent

        High's closed        2     (300, 301)
        high's to low        3     (410, 411 [both subject to 376 actions], and 384)
        Medium closed        1     (394)
        Medium to low        1     (211)


          These are shown in attachment 1

        The summary of acceptance incidents table is shown in attachment 2      r'

        On this basis, grounds for not accepting will rest on:
        ■ the 3 disputed high severity incidents
        ■ inability to agree resolution plan for the medium Acceptance incidents.

                                                                                         POL00028360




The most worrying Incident is : 298 System Instability
• Pathway have'not explained satisfactorily why these occur
• they have requested an extension to the time to conclude their analysis. This gives
  us insufficient time to respond so we have refused
  the frequency of occurrence has not been clearly established or agreed
       • we have rung around samples of offices
       • we have received the ICL HSH logs while awaiting Pathway analysis
       • we have suggested ways for Pathway to get more detail on freezing
• Some of these occurrences maybe the responsibility of POCL (the SPMR rebooting
  without good reason)                                                          -
• this could cost £1.8m per annum and inconvenience 1 million customers a month.

The Clear High is: 376 TIP - Data Integrity
376 is a clear high (as it was originally agreed by Pathway as high) but Pathway are
making progress:
        Pathway had a codified work around:
        • implemented 3/8
        • Pathway will not confirm that this solves all the problem
        • We need a full Accounting period to be sure, but will accept 2 full clear
           weeks. (We have had periods of low occurrences, so one week of zero
           occurrences could be followed by a non zero week). The second full week
           will occur on 18u' cash account and would flow through our systems for
           checking on 2311.

We will only get the Pathway root cause analysis today 11`x'' Pathway claim they will
have an adequate rectification plan by Friday 13`h. These problems are caught by
"matching" at TIP, but this facility will not be available in roll out.
So POCL want:
a) a solution that meets the requirements: i.e. a full reconciliation in the Pathway
   domain (before the data gets to TIP)
b) to agree the rectification plan
c) the rectification proven

NB. Problem 891 looked good after 1 week but then became clear the rectification
had failed.

The high cost of work around incident: 218 Training
                                                                         r




Training has not been adequate. Training is not just the course but other events. With
ICL, we have worked on a range of solutions. While these solutions have improved
the position, staff have only been able to cope as well as they do, because of HFSO
support.
This is shown in attachment 3

Details of all the disputed Medium and High severity incidents will be sent by Ruth
Holleran in time for the meeting.
