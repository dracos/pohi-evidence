vur defence barrister has asked for all of Gareth's replies in relation to the
Defences 2nd Interim Report (see attachment below) to be produced as a witness
statement. I would suggest that the question from the defence is reproduced and then
Gareth's replies are recorded immediately after for clarity purposes.

A pre court hearing has been set for the 1st February and ideally if possible it would
be helpful if the statement could be received by Friday of this week. Could you let
me know if this is going to be possible.

John

Here is the answer from Fujitsu to the points that you asked about.

Penny is keen to know that this is all that is required from them, can you let me
know?

Regarding the other ponts, Mark emailed Rob Wilson for some clarity/advice and I am
still awaiting the information.

Thanks

Trial 15th March 2009 Guildford Crown Court J

Hi Jane
I hope all is well with you.

Our expert, Gareth Jenkins, has made comments on the 2nd Interim Technical expert's
report, which I attach: for review by Prosecution Counsel. Please note that’ where POL
is required to respond he has stated so in the text. We agreed that in the New Year
we would discuss how this would be presented.

As for Question 3-of your note dated 2 December, the simple answer is that the system

. . . 2
FUJ00152887
FUJ00152887

will behave very differently in that all the data will be held in a central database
and the UI will be very different.

However the basic principles for accounting will be the same, though much of the
detail in terms of error handling etc will change. If more detail is required then
that really requires a full discussion on how HNG-X works and will get. very lengthy
and involved.

Andy has responded to Jon Longman's note of 16 November. That leaves questions, 1 and
2 of your note dated 2 December outstanding and Andy is waiting for a zesponse from
Jon Longman before he can proceed.

I believe all questions are covered ~ do'you agree?

Kind regards
Penny

I attach a report from the defence expert where he has highlighted a number of
problems with the Horizon system. Our barrister, Warwick Tatford has asked that the
problemswith Horizon that he has raised in his report are replied to in a witness
statement form. I presume that an employee of fujitsu would have to produce the
witness statement.

(See attached file: misra - 2nd interim technical expert's report 19.11.09.doc) (See
attached file: misra -electronic Funds Tranfer PCI
sched.doc)

In addition to this the defence have also requested the following information with ,
regard the hardware equipment installed at West Byfleet.

1) Please provide details of any business testing carried out by the Post Office on
the system before it went live.

2) Please provide the service logs for the system at West Byfleet PO for a period
commencing six months prior to the defendant taking over as sub postmistress
(30/06/2005) to the present day.
FUJ00152887
FUJ00152887

3) Please confirm when and why. the hardware in the system at West Byfleet PO has been
changed.

4) By whom have these changes been made.

5) When new hardware was installed at West Byfleet was it brand new or reconditioned
6) If it is the latter please confirm the identity of the PO from which the
reconditioned hardware came and why the hardware has been removed from that PO.
