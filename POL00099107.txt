Our Commentary on selected paragraphs of the Second Sight Interim Report is set out in the attached document. Thank
you Lesley and Simon for your input on this.

i have also placed the text below to assist those reviewing it on iPads, BBs etc.

Please let us know if you would like to discuss any issue further or if anything requires further explanation.
Kind regards, Rodric

Commentary On Second Sight Interim Report dated 07.07.13

Generally
a. Soas to avoid any suggestion that we tried to “rewrite” the report or compromise its independence, our
commients on earlier drafts were focussed on correcting inaccuracies and attempting to make the report clearer.

b. To stress the proportionality of these issues to Horizon as a whole, we asked SS to specify hard numbers instead
of using phrases like “in almost all of the cases” (para. 1.7), “in a number of cases” (para. 2.6), or “multiple
SPMRs” (para. 7.2). SS has not always done this.

Para 2.4— We are bearing the cost of the investigation, We have worked to respond to SS’s requests for information by
obtaining it from various sources in our business. We have no interest in prolonging or increasing the cost of SS’s
review.

Para. 2.6 ~ POL’s seven-year “Document Retention Policy” is reasonable by industry standards for a business like ours.

Para. 3.5 ~ SS makes a point that there has been no closure. This is not surprising when SS has not concluded its work on

the Interim Report’s 4 Spot Reviews (see para. 7.6 ~ “preliminary conclusions”; “substantial progress in investigating...”).
Para. 5.2 ~- Our Spot Review Responses were drafted to be read by SS as forensic investigators, not SPMRs.

Para. 5.4 — We asked SS to clarify that its statement that “robust controls” can fail is not based on anything from its
Horizon review, but on its wider experience.

Para. 5.5 ~We asked SS to clarify that no evidence of “control circumvention” had been identified in its review to
date. We also told SS that SPMRs have evidence (e.g. branch reports etc) from which they can challenge transactions.

Para 6.1~ We dispute the finding that we did not provide “timely, accurate and complete information”. The delay was 4
minutes, and was caused by the SPMR’s actions in repeatedly resubmitting (rather than cancelling) the transaction.

Para 6.3 - We dispute the process change was connected to the SPMR’s issues - the change was completed two years
later.

Para 6.6 ~ We asked that the Report reflect that there was no real cash shortfall of £9,800 because the matter was
addressed contemporaneously by the help desk. SS report suggests he was asked to pay this. We do not believe that he
was.

Para 6.7 — SS asked to note that the anomaly first occurred in December 2011, and that it only repeated itself annually
{i.e. it would not reappear for another 12 months).

Para. 6.9 - We have confirmed with SS that no SPMR made a loss as a result of this issue.

Para. 7.2 — This sets out the SPMRs’ allegations, many of which have not yet been reviewed by Post Office in conjunction
with SS.

Para. 7.7 — The allegations here are based on data supplied to SS by JFSA which has not yet been shared with us.

Para. 8.2(c) - We dispute this for the same reasons we dispute para. 6.1.

Appendix 1 -- Spot Review O01

Para. 1.11 —We dispute this for the same reasons we dispute para’s 6.1 and 8.2(c}.

Appendix 2 — Spot Review 05

Para. 1.09 — SS has been provided with evidence to show that the Bracknell “Basement” is a test site only. The “conflict
of evidence” is therefore that the SPMR continues to believe what he believes, and does not accept the response Post
Office and Fujitsu have supplied.

Appendix 3 ~ Spot Review 21
Para. 1.10 — SS are yet to review the specific transaction data we have provided on this Spot Review, which may resolve

this issue.

Appendix 4 — Spot Review 22
Para. 1.20 ~ We agree, SS needs to complete this Spot Review.
