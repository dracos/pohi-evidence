The Chair introduced Robert Razzell, UKG! CFO and Company Secretary.

The Board noted and accepted the resignation of Martin Donnelly as a Board member, pursuant
to his departure from BEIS and commencement of his new posting as DIT Permanent
Secretary. The Chair thanked Martin for his support of UKGI and its predecessor body, the
Shareholder Executive.

2. Declarations of interest

Each Director of the Company who had an interest under sections 177 and/or 182 of the
Companies Act 2006 declared such an interest and it was noted that, in accordance with article
7 of the Company's Articles of Association, each such Director was entitled to vote in respect of
any proposed matter in which he/she was interested and that each such Director was entitled to
be (and was) taken into account in ascertaining whether a quorum was present.

It was noted that since the last meeting Jitesh Gadhia had been appointed to the House of
Lords and discussions were in train to establish the extent to which this might present any
conflict of interest and, if so, how this might best be addressed.

3. Minutes from previous meeting

The minutes from the 13! July 2016 Board meeting and the 3 August 2016 Board call were
approved.

4. Board Forward Look

The Board noted the forward look.

5. Appointment of Senior Independent Director

The Board approved the appointment of Jane Guyett as Senior Independent Director (SID), and
noted some minor amendments to the SID Terms of Reference, which was then approved by
the Board.

6. Appointment of Non-Executive Directors

The Board resolved that, having consent to act, Charles Roxburgh and Alex Chisholm be
appointed as Non-Executive Directors of the Company. The board further approved the
appointment of Susan Acland-Hood as Charles Roxburgh's alternate director. It was noted that
these appointments were subject to approval by the Economic Secretary to the Treasury [Post
Meeting Note: this approval was received on 28 September 2016 subsequent to the meeting]
The Company Secretary was instructed to arrange the necessary filings at Companies House.

7. Chief Executive’s Report

The CEO drew the Board's attention to the change in ministerial teams across almost all the
departments with which UKGI has a relationship, the potential challenge this may present, and
the need to further develop relationships with other departments, with HMT seeking UKGI's
involvement with MoD, and potential further work forthcoming from DCLG. The Departmental
NED noted the successful outcome of the Hinckley Point review, and that BEIS will be working
with UKGI to continue to promote inward investment into the UK.

8.1 Airbus

UKGI00016770
UKGI00016770

8.5 Royal Mail

Since the paper has been drafted, it has become clear that Pathway will not move any further,
and that the options are now whether to take the portfolios to market in any case, noting the
current strong secondary market prices, or attempt to remove Pathway, which will clearly be
resource intensive and will delay the sale. The team noted that the Ministerial view was that the
government should not be taking the market risk associated with a ‘hold’ position and that a sale
should be pursued. Robin Lawther queried the ongoing carrying cost of the assets; it was noted
that there is a high regulatory and compliance burden associated with these investments, and
these will need to be taken into account in future decision making.

Action: the Board to be given an opportunity to express its point of view at the next decision
point.
