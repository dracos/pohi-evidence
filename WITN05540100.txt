FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF PAUL WARBRICK

1.

| had multiple roles (detailed below) within the Post Office but it is worth noting
Horizon had been fully deployed for a number of years before my career

e Initially working as a consultant in the inhouse consultancy unit applying
operational research and market research techniques to provide insight
across various business problems (not IT).

e | subsequently moved to a role in marketing as a proposition
development manager shaping business strategy in the government
services area and developing new services to sell to government clients.

programmes where | led IT system implementation for the introduction of
