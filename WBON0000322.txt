Dear Sirs

The Post Office Group Litigation
Horizon Issues Trial — Disclosure of Audit Reports

We write further to your letter of today's date.

The pre-2011 annual audit reports produced by Ernst & Young relating to Horizon are not within Post
Office's control and it cannot therefore provide disclosure of them. Post Office cannot compel Royal Mail
Group to provide these documents and we explained in our letter of [x] that it may be necessary to obtain
an order from the Court for disclosure of these documents. The Claimants have not sought to obtain
such an order.

To resolve this matter, it is proposed that the Judge is asked jointly by both parties to make an Order that
Royal Mail Group provide disclosure of the pre-2011 annual audit reports of Horizon produced by Ernst &
Young, which they are able to locate under a reasonable and proportionate search. Please could you
confirm that you agree with this approach.

Yours faithfully
