Hi Gareth
Neneh has said that you have kindly agreed to look at my mark up of the witness statement.
A lot of my comments relate to my general ignorance of how things work - Brian Pinder is dealing with these issues.

My immediate concerns are that I am not convinced that the statement is factually correct. I know about the demise of
OBCS, but I dont know when it was rolled out to the estate, did it happen overnight or was there are phasing out period? I
don't understand how network banking works (1 did look at the procedures you suggested but I was unable to put the
picture together) let alone provide the narrative. Is this something you could help us with?

Someone mentioned to me that reporting to the accounts department was no longer happening as we state - do you know
if this is the case?

If you could highlight anything in the statement which is not factually correct you would be doing us a great service.

Kind regards and many thanks
Penny

Neneh,

I've updated the Witness Statement as discussed.

I'm left some of the Networking bit highlighted in Blue, since I can’t say that I know it is true (but it probably is). It may be
OK just to delete that bit. What is left in that section may be sufficient (1 guess it depends upon what the issue is!) I’ve
removed the blue highlighting from the rest of the document.

I've used “Revisions” so that you can see what I've changed. I've highlighted the Date etc in yellow to remind us to
update it for the final version.

Happy to discuss further.
