Subject: RE: Second Sight Follow up call

We met briefly at Spm.

No further developments this afternoon, save for the Jo Swinson statement which was supportive of the position the
Post Office were taking.

Andrea will circulate a sit-rep first thing covering anything that’s happened overnight.

Thanks for everyone’s prompt support.
