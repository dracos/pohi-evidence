Dear Sirs

Alan Bates & Others-v Rost Office LimitedPost Office Group Litigation
Horizon Issues Trial Disclosure

We refer to your second letter dated 27 September 2019.

Our understanding from reading your letter is that you do not take issue with the disclosure we have
ye have prowedad than

provided, nor the timing in which: ithisI disclosure was provided. Should you wish
to file any submissions on these documents, then that is a matter for you and your clients. Please

however find below responses to the matters raised in your letter.

1. Previous draft of KELs

We enclose with this letter a copy of the documents as received by Paul Smith of Post Office from Fujitsu
‘on 3 and 9 September 2019. This should clarify for you which documents relate to the 12 issues we
refer to in our second letter dated 25 September 2019.

2 Peaks and KELs referred to

Itis these 12 documents on which we requested and provided copies of any Peaks and KELs referred to.
For example, BattleN5341P refers to PC0261948 and PC0279457. PC0261948 had already been
disclosed to you (POL-0429543) and PC0279457 had not been, therefore we requested and provided
this to you by way of our 25 September 2019 letter. The example you have given, PC0278614 is a Peak
referred to in spar1458P, one of the documents that relates to the 12 issues. The Peak was therefore
provided to you because it is referred to in that document and had not previously been disclosed.

2.3.___ Previously disclosed KEIs

In respect of your point that any intervening dates of changes to KELs are not captured, nor any changes
which have been made (or made and then subsequently revised) on the face of the documents, you
have already been made aware of this position in our client's Electronic Documents Questionnaire dated
6 December 2017 {C9/1/46}. In it, Post Office explained that "(t]he KEL only contains the current
database entries and is constantly updated and so the current version will not necessarily reflect the
version that was in place at the relevant time. The previous entries / versions of the current entries are
no longer available”. IHad you wanted to take issue with this, you should have done so before now.

‘Commented [ALP]: Do we want to expressly say that
POL has an adverse disclosure obli which is ongoing and
disclosure was provided in line with that obligation?

‘Commented [ALP12]: What about documents recid on 13
‘September?

Did Paul receive any other copies of the KELs other than the
documents rec'd on 3, 9 and 13 September which also need to
bbe disclosed?

Freeths are also going to ask for the draft version of the
‘proposed process flow which was sent to Martin Godlbold on
7 Aug 2019 (see email chain from Paul Smith) ~ do we want to
get this now?

‘Commented [ALP13]: Why do these earlier draft
documents clarify which of the 12 issues

disclosed document relate to? Should
bbe a separate point from the disclosure
documents?

‘Commented [ALP14]: Lucy — sorry I dont understand the
fist sentence. Is it the case that there are no futher
documents to be disclosed as we have already disclosed all of
the Peaks and KELs referred to in the adverse documents?
‘Commented [ALP15]: Are we going to be providing
disclosure of the Peaks and KELS referred to in the adverse
‘documents which have not yet been disclosed? I think this is
what Freeths are requesting disclosure of.

(Commented [ALP16]: This needs double-checking with FJ_)
