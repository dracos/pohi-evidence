2.6. Ministers have given a clear message to move forward with the sale of the
remaining government shares -— this is likely to take place in two tranches.
UKFI have been consulted. Parliament must be informed and a submission
has been put to Ministers. It was agreed that Robert Swannell would represent
the Board on the transaction [ACTION].

Met Office

2.7. The General Review of the Met Office has now been completed and provided
a good evidence base for the upcoming Spending Review. ShEx’s view is that
Met Office’s function should be delivering a public good. The market for
commercial activities is limited. There will be a question for Ministers as to
whether responsibility for the Met Office remains in ShEx.

Other topics

2.8. The Board noted updates on Hinkley Point, BBC, Ordnance Survey and
UKEF.

3. Future of ShEx

3.1. MR outlined the upcoming Machinery of Government change with ShEx and
UKFI brought together under the newly created UKGI. RS will Chair UKGI with
James Leigh-Pemberton acting as Executive Deputy Chair. MR will serve as
UKGI CEO.The new UKGI Board will comprise two ShEx NEDs (RLa and
GG), two UKFI NEDs (Philip Remnant and Jitesh Gadhia), with representation
planned from HMT and BIS.

3.2. RJ will lead the transition in ShEx. Retaining the current ShEx operating model
is key and clearly the detail of the transition arrangements will be very
important. RS will be happy to help on comms.

3.3. The Board agreed that culture was a key consideration to which TUPE
arrangements would be fundamental. It was also noted that the new body
would not own assets itself. The current intention is to co-locate with UKFI, but
the detail is yet to be confirmed. RJ agreed to update the Board on the
transition plan as it developed [ACTION].

4, Recruitment

41.

MR summarised the recent recruitment campaign, explaining that it had been
a success and the single biggest recruitment conducted by ShEx. The Board
noted that the bigger process had been beneficial in creating a buzz in the
market. The ability to shuffle candidates between ED and AD had also been
useful.

5. KPIs — ShEx Dashboard

5.1.

5.2.

RJ provided a new ShEx Dashboard, updated from Board comments on the
previous KPI paper. The Dashboard will be included as a standing paper in

future Board meetings [ACTION] and considered by ExCo on a monthly basis.

The Board suggested several improvements [ACTION]:

o Directional arrows or equivalent mechanism should be added to give a

sense of project progress

© Traffic lights should be dated to ensure clarity in light of the investment

reviews taking place at different times

o Projects should be ordered by risk rather then alphabetically
co The target at page 3, bullet 2 should focus on progress rather than a

percentage of amber/green traffic light ratings

UKGI transition update - ShEx Board 1 July 2015 (15)19

Introduction

ShEx and UKFI have been looking at how best to design UKGI from three key
perspectives:

= to meet the criteria set out in the letter from the Prime Minister to the
Shareholder Executive at the time of UKGI’s announcement as well as
ensuring that UKGI represents value for money;

= to preserve the best of both organisations while exploiting possible synergies;
and

= to consider issues that need to be managed carefully to ensure an effective and
successful transition.

We have set out a vision for UKGI and a proposal for the work UKGI should do to
ensure it adds most value. We have also included initial views on the supporting
principles underpinning our approach to governance, people, finance and the
supporting infrastructure required.

The aim of this paper is to enable key stakeholders to confirm they are aligned in their
vision of UKGI and to identify early whether there are any major legal, cultural or
financial hurdles before developing the detail and implementing the new structure.
Following review and sign off at Steering Group on 30" June, the next steps will be to:

= share this paper with wider stakeholders to facilitate appropriate HMT/BIS
discussions; and

= establish a critical path to creating UKGI and to test what is possible by Autumn
2015.

The transition is being managed as a project with a ShEx SRO and ShEx/UKFI project
team members. Project governance has been established, and engagement with staff
and other stakeholders has begun.

Vision for UKGI

UKGI brings a unique opportunity to combine ShEx’s expertise in corporate finance
and governance with UKFI’s equity and capital market skills. Together we can work
effectively across the whole of Whitehall to deliver the Government's long term plan of
asset sales as well as achieving Government's aim of running large, publically-owned
assets in a way that secures good value for money, and improving the performance of
existing assets. We can also continue to build Government's corporate finance
capability which can be deployed in the event of significant corporate negotiations and
instructions.

A GovCo structure will enable us to access more easily access the skills we need from
the private sector but it is critical that we also retain access to civil service talent; this
blend of skill and experience ensures that technical advice is framed in a way which is
understood in a political context and appropriate for implementation by Government
Departments. Key to our success will be our enhanced operational independence,
while retaining a business model which allows us to work directly for relevant
Secretaries of State, integrating with departmental teams as necessary.

UKGI Work
To add most value, UKGI should play a role in:
1. All significant corporate asset sales.

2. All Government financial interventions into corporate structures.

3. Organisations where it can have a meaningful shareholder function:

e With a commercial focus (e.g. NATS, OS, GIB, BBB, POL, RM pension
assets); and/or

e Facing big and ongoing commercial/corporate finance/governance
challenges (e.g. NDA, Network Rail, UKEF).

The policy function should be clearly defined and owned by the sponsor
department (ie UKGI should have minimal/no policy function).

4. Organisations/assets facing complex transformations or with governance at the
heart of the model change:

¢ Assets/projects where we can reasonably expect a long term UKGI
shareholder role (e.g Highways England, Network Rail, LCCC)

e Assets/projects without a long-term shareholder role for UKGI (e.g.
CH, INSS, LR)

UKGI should aim at the outset to have a clear view on when a UKGI role ends and
others take over the ongoing shareholder function if asset does not fit into (3) above

5. Advising on and participating any large Government negotiations with
corporates (e.g. Airbus, Astra Zeneca).

30
UKGI00016734

UKGI00016734

OFFICIAL: SENSITIVE
Areas to avoid:

1. Taking on the “commercial and governance”/shareholder role just because we
are known to have governance expertise; other factors including, some or all of,
financial materiality; risk profile; degree of commerical operation and political
interest should be taken into account when conisdering new work.

2. Taking on policy areas without clear commercial drivers and definition of
shareholder role.

3. Resource intensive projects which preclude other work where UKGI could add
more value.

4. Keeping an asset in UKGI when there is no longer any transformational role or
significant shareholder function (e.g. CH and LR and INSS over time).

UKGI Governance

Below is the proposed governance structure for UKGI upon constitution, including the
composition and relationship between the various boards. This structure will be a first
phase (Phase 1), designed to take UKFI up to the point of its merger into UKGI
(Phase 2).

Board, and will reportto it

Phase 1

UKGI will be established as Companies Act private company limited by shares, with
HM Treasury as its sole shareholder (albeit with the UKGI share held by TSOL on
behalf of HMT). UKGI will acquire UK Financial Investments Ltd as a wholly owned
subsidiary.

The priority at this stage will be to ensure: i) minimal duplication between the Board of
UKGI, the Board of UKFI and ShExComn; ii) effective and efficient ongoing operation
of UKFI and of the ShEx division of UKGI and iii) clear lines of responsibility and
accountability. This will be achieved primarily through effective delegation of decision -
making by UKGI to ShExComm and to the UKFI Board respectively, and a clear remit
for the UKGI Board. Initially SnExComm and the UKFI board should focus on their

31
UKGI00016734

UKGI00016734

OFFICIAL: SENSITIVE

core business supported and overseen by the UKGI board which, in turn will focus on
the operation of and policies for UKGI.

UKGI and UKFI will continue to operate in the near term relatively independently from
each other; UKFI will retain its existing Framework Agreement and Accounting Officer.
However the two groups will work together wherever possible and support platforms
will be combined as soon as possible.

ShEx will be a division of UKGI and will not be given separate corporate form, but a
sub-committee of UKGI will be formed (comprising the existing ShEx Advisory Board)
to consider and approve ShEx business (“ShExComm’). We will seek legal advice to
establish UKGI in way such that it should not require regulatory approval.
Consideration will need to be given to whether ERG and other relevant
government/central controls should apply to UKGI (and if so, specifically which).

The CEO of UKGI will be the UKGI Accounting Officer, to whom financial delegations
may be made by HMT and by OGDs.

Demonstrating both in principle and in practice that UKGI's identity is distinct from
HMT is crucial to facilitating UKGI involvement in new work areas and in supporting
successful relationships on existing projects. As ShEx is now, UKGI will be
accountable to the Secretary of State of the Department that owns the asset (or project
etc.) in relation to which UKGI is providing services.

UKGI will enter into an agreement with HMT setting out UKGI’s overarching objectives,
and the framework within which will UKGI will operate. We are working on a skeleton
UKGI Framework Agreement which will be shared with this Steering Group following
legal, and working level, review. It will combine principles enshrined in the UKFI
Framework Agreement, such as: freedom to operate the UKGI Budget (agreed
annually by HMT); ability to fulfil and deliver the activities and objectives set out in its
Framework Document; and that HMT will not be involved in day-to-day operational and
commercial matters. It will also require additional provisions such as the ability for
UGKI to enter into standardised written arrangements with Departments setting out
UKGI's role and independence in relation to assets/projects etc. owned by those
Departments.

Phase 2

UKFI will ultimately fold into UKGI and its respective board committees will cease to
exist. UKGI will retain Audit & Risk and Remuneration and Nominations Committees
and the UKGI CEO will become sole Accounting Officer. The timing of Phase 2 is likely
to be between 18 months and three years from now. This will be decided by HMT upon
advice from the UKGI Board and will depend on various factors relating to the sell
down of UKFI shareholdings and ongoing operations of UKFI.

People

The establishment of UKGI will mean a significant change for ShEx people. It will be
important to protect the collaborative and can-do culture of ShEx and continue to
attract and retain an exceptional mix of civil servants and corporate finance
professionals. The UKGI model could give ShEx greater flexibility to attract and
motivate private sector expertise. It may also provide a platform for more flexible
incentivisation of talented civil servants, but it presents a risk that a change in
employment status threatens ShEx’s ability to retain and recruit current civil service
talent.

32
UKGI00016734

UKGI00016734

OFFICIAL: SENSITIVE

We are in the early stages of developing an HR strategy built around the freedoms of a
GovCo but which seeks to minimise the risks around failing to retain civil servants.
Staff are being engaged via emails, weekly huddles and all staff events to ensure we
understand staff concerns and to communicate the benefits of the new model.

There is no requirement to vest via two stages (ie making a transfer of employees from
BIS to HMT, then from HMT to UKGI). Therefore we propose transferring staff from
BIS directly to UKGI. Early discussions with the Government Legal Department (GLD)
suggest that as this will be a transfer of staff from the civil service to a non-civil service
employer, TUPE regulations and associated case law will apply. Staff have already
raised concerns around what this will mean for their careers/status/development
opportunities/pensions etc. Therefore ShEx is considering the various implications of a
TUPE transfer prior to the crucial decision being made as to which staff are “in scope”
to TUPE transfer.

Of the various categories of ShEx staff, the below is likely to apply. We will aim to
confirm the position on or prior to the next Steering Group.

1) FTAs (c. 25 people): will be “in scope” and TUPE across to UKGI.

2) Civil servants (c. 80 people as at 25/06/15 including those currently away from
ShEx on loan or secondment): will TUPE across to UKGI if “in scope”. However
we may wish to second some of them if they are/can be deemed “out of scope”.

3) Staff on loan to ShEx from OGDs (c. 8 people): if necessary and/or appropriate
their loans will cease and they will enter into an agreement seconding them
from their home department to UKGI from the transfer date.

4) Private sector personnel on secondment into ShEx (c. 8 people); secondments
will cease immediately prior to the transfer date and if appropriate and
necessary a new secondment will be entered into with UKGI; and

5) Staff supporting ShEx, who are paid for by ShEx, from other areas of BIS (c. 5
economists and 3 finance staff): will TUPE across to UKGI depending on
whether their roles are “in scope”.

We would also like to be able to make the following assurances to staff:

1. Confirmation that any Civil Servant who TUPEs to UKGI will have a right of
reinstatement for five years. This would allow individuals to apply for civil
service jobs at stage 3.

2. Confirmation that any Civil Servants seconded to UKGI will have a right of
return to BIS or HMT for four years.

3. To help effect to 2 and 3 above all Civil Servants who TUPE to UKGI will retain
full access to the Civil Service jobs website

4. UKGI will implement a package of T&Cs upon or around Vesting to attract and
motivate new joiners. This will need to be a total reward package that is
competitive enough to attract the talent needed by UKGI. It will also need to be
consistent with maintaining a mixed economy with civil servant secondees.
UKGI will aim to align contractual terms and conditions for all UKGI employees
within a reasonable timeframe following vesting.

5. Future UKGI recruitment of Civil Servant secondees shall be open to the whole
Civil Service.

Finance

Early discussions with BIS suggest a number of areas for negotiation (particularly
where ShEx has performed a policy function on BIS’s behalf that BIS will now have to
support). The admin budget is expected to transfer to UKGI but the amount is subject
to negotiation. The main factors (some of which work in ShEx’s favour and others
don’t) influencing the final sum are as follows:

= re-classification of consultancy spend on asset sales as programme
expenditure (see below);

= ceasing policy or other functions that leaves an unfunded legacy role for BIS;

= additional resources for UKGI (e.g. HR Director, Finance liaison, procurement);

= additional facilities for UKGI (e.g. IT, accommodation inc. refurbishment,
leasehold);

The intention would be for programme budgets to remain with the responsible
Department. Finance Group (BIS) is considering carving out the consultancy spend (to
BIS, allocated to ShEx) in respect of asset sales which has been classified as
programme in line with principles agreed with HMT.

Work is in train to establish the joint budget for the two organisations and to identify
any funding gap. Options for addressing this are to bid for additional monies from HMT
or to charge for UKGI services in some instances, though the same downsides exist
for UKGI as they do for ShEx now e.g. doing may dissuade Departments from
engagement, possible procurement, state aid issues etc. An early decision needs to
be made on UKGI's overall funding model, and work is ongoing to assess this.

Where ShEx continues to perform a governance role on a BIS asset, we are exploring
whether the delegated financial authority and the budget allocations in respect of the
asset will continue as now post-transition. The BIS assets would remain within BIS's
budgeting and accounting boundary. It is anticipated that the principle relationship
would be with BIS DG, Finance which could be formalised by an exchange of letters
setting out the roles, responsibilities and accountabilities and who would appear before
the PAC, BISCOM etc. This is subject to legal advice and may also require negotiation
with ToA.

BIS is also currently considering whether it wishes to allocate any new projects to
ShEx.

34
UKGI00016734

UKGI00016734

OFFICIAL: SENSITIVE

Accommodation

The overall aim is to co-locate ShEx and UKFI into one building at, or as soon after,
the vesting date as possible; having a neutral space and separating ShEx from BIS will
ensure that UKGI has a new feel and promote integration between ShEx and UKGI
staff. Timing of the move needs to take account of:

= availability of suitable Whitehall space;

= disruption to the continuing business given UKFI’s and ShEx’s continuing
delivery of a number of transactions;

* Decision and timing on a shared IT solution.

Consideration is also being given to moving UKFI into an extended space near ShEx in
1VS for a period (6-12 months) before moving out to an identified co-location in
Whitehall. We will need to decide if the benefits of early co-location outweigh the likely
disruption - particularly to UKFIl who would need to move their IT with all the risk that
entails - given that we would hope to leave 1VS for a co-located building in the medium
term anyway.

ShEx/UKFI will now approach GPU to request a suitable space in the Whitehall area
(noting UKFI’s need for a secure room to handle market sensitive data). BIS Estates
thought that little was immediately available but that space could become free in
Summer.

Information and Communications Technology (ICT)

An ICT workstream is currently being scoped. Currently UKFI have their own IT
platform, distinct and separate from the HMT systems. This infrastructure was
redesigned in 2014. This was achieved working through Cabinet Office and GDS
controls.

There is a key early decision to be made on the direction of the IT solution. UKFI have
provided information/recommendations on their systems to inform a decision on
whether this would be suitable for UKGI’s needs, assuming we will need to be
operating on a single platform. Other options are for UKGI to operate on BIS or HMT
systems, or for UKGI to acquire its own new ICT platform. The following issues are
currently under consideration:

= Can UKFI's platform be easily and cost-effectively expanded to accommodate
us?

Does UKGI need to be on the Government Secure Intranet?

Can we instead use another department's IT as a shared service?

What kind of help desk support will we need?

What security level is appropriate?

Proposal for future BIS/ShEx interaction as a result of the UKGI transformation

This note sets out the ShEx proposal for the changes to BIS/ShEx interaction that
would support the successful establishment of UKGI. It provides both an overview of
the changes, the impact on BIS and sets out the situation for each asset.

The proposal is based on seven key issues:

Issue

Impact on BIS

No movement of ShEx BIS assets in
the short term — although all assets will
stay within BIS there may be scope for
some MOG changes later dependent on
sale/transformation plans.

Minimal.

Virtually no change in ShEx’s
Commercial and Governance role — the
only exception is Met Office which we are
proposing moves to K&l.

Ownership of the Met Office sponsorship
and governance function with potential
admin implications

Clarification of policy functions - there
are several areas where BIS have
expressed an interest in creating a policy
role for an asset within BIS. Additionally,
there is some existing blurring of roles
where clarity would useful.

Potentially increased/clarified policy roles
in relation to BBB and UK Export Finance
at the request of BIS and Companies
House, Land Registry, Ordnance Survey
and INSS as a recommendation from
ShEx. All have potential admin
implications.

No movement of budgets but
delegation of financial authority and
allocation to ShEx — although budget
lines will remain within BIS there will need
to be an arrangement to allow ShEx to
manage them on the Department's behalf.

Agreement to Delegate financial authority
and budget allocation for all current ShEx
assets budgets except Met Office —
approx. £250m RDEL and £2.1bn CDEL.
ShEx would need to agree with BIS the
governance arrangement for this
proposal.

Transferring Accounting Office
function from ShEx to BIS — in a few
cases ShEx officials act as Accounting
Officer. Our understanding of TOA advice
is that this should move to BIS.

Ultimate Accounting Officer responsibility
for BISCo (Royal Mail Pension Assets),
EHL and PSH remains with the BIS AO
with ShEx providing advice on
management of the HMG’s investments.

Ensuring BIS sight of ShEx advice — to
maintain propriety ShEx advice will need
to be shared with a BIS official. In most
cases this will be BIS finance.

It is proposed that DG Finance main point
of contact. This may require an additional
role for BIS Finance with admin
implications. Where appropriate BIS
policy officials will be consulted before
advice is put up to the Perm Sec and
Ministers.

Formally delegating certain other
functions to ShEx - at present ShEx both
signs contracts on behalf of BIS and
provides training and appraisal to senior
management. This should continue but
with formal agreement to do so.

Legal advice is being sought.

Background on the issues identified

[ No movement of ShEx BIS assets in the short term ]

We considered a range of possible options for assets to move but we do not believe
that there is any strong argument for why any ShEx assets should be transferred out of
BIS. There are however a number of transactions and transformations being
considered which could provide a rationale for a move in the future. Both Urenco and
GIB are currently being considered for sale. In the case of a transaction not being
taken forward, the most appropriate parent Dept. may need to be reconsidered,
although we are not advising this.

The potential future of the Land Registry is also being considered. Depending on
Ministerial views on the transformation of the organisation, a move to DCLG may make
sense in the longer term given the minimal policy linkage to BIS. Again, we are not
proposing this course of action at this stage.

{ Virtually no change in ShEx’s Commercial and Governance role ]

Having considered the role ShEx plays across BIS assets we do not believe that in the
vast majority of cases there is the need for any change other than around the Met
Office. In the case of the Met Office the recent General Review and Commercial
Review has not identified a strong basis for ongoing ShEx sponsorship and we believe
that there would be benefit to empowering K&l’s relationship through their taking on
the sponsorship role.

In the longer term there may also be scope for consideration of ShEx’s role in
Companies House and INSS but in the short term work is underway to see if these two
organisations could have a closer relationship.

{ Clarification of policy functions

Across ShEx there are several areas where ShEx undertakes quasi-policy roles that
should be located in BIS (or elsewhere) or where there is no current policy link
between a ShEx asset to a central Dept. The transition of ShEx to UKGI is an
opportunity to rationalise this situation.

Our proposal, mindful of the need creating unnecessary admin costs, is therefore that
where there is a clear BIS request for policy involvement a new role within BIS is
created, where assets stay with BIS the policy should stay with them and that
consideration is given those areas where policy responsibility is uncertain.

Other options, such as ShEx or BIS creating explicit policy roles for all assets were
rejected.

Minimal movement of budgets ]

In the vast majority of cases there is little direct budgetary relationship between ShEx
and its assets as budgets and dividends generally flow through to ShEx via BIS. There
is however a substantial linkage in terms of agreeing assets budgets and monitoring
their use where ShEx plays a major role, supported by BIS Finance. In order for ShEx
to continue to play this role (and avoid the creation of admin pressure on BIS to
manage it instead) there will need to be a formal delegation of financial authority and
budget allocation for all current ShEx assets with the exception of Met Office. The
prosperity of this action will be supported by the both reallocating Accounting Office
roles and ensuing BIS Finance engagement in advice (see below).

Additionally, post-transition, discussions on dividend policy and funding allocations will
require participation of ShEx, policy team and BIS Finance.

[ Transferring Accounting Office function from ShEx to BIS ]

In a few cases ShEx senior officials act as Accounting Officer for certain assets (BISCo
(Royal Mail Pension Assets), POSH and EHL). Our understanding of TOA advice is
that this would revert back to BIS.

Alternatives to this approach would require a discussion with TOA.

{ Ensuring BIS sight of ShEx advice I

ShEx already provides services to other Departments on assets and corporate finance
projects, including providing advice to Ministers. However, for relationships with DECC
and DfT (two of the bigger users of ShEx resources), ShEx officials work with officials
in those Depts.

In the case of the NDA for example, a DECC DG accompanies ShEx officials at
meetings and clears some advice. This reflects that the NDA within DECC presents
significant risk and the Perm Sec takes a significant interest — but this relationship
creates challenges in terms of managing the relationship.

In DfT, ShEx officials provide input direct to DfT officials.

Under new arrangements with BIS there are three evident options: i) ShEx reports
directly to BIS Ministers - though there may be a propriety issue with ShEx officials
providing direct advice to BIS Ministers without BIS officials having sight and therefore
acting as link to the responsible Accounting Officer (although this keeps the process
simple); ii) Replicating something similar to the DECC arrangement, and for those
areas listed above where policy roles are created, they can also act as the point of
contact for any ShEx submissions; iii) the asset transfers elsewhere meaning that no
intermediate step / relationship is necessary.

38

OFFICIAL: SENSITIVE

Our proposal is option ii) and that that ShEx should be able to provide advice direct to
Ministers where they have responsibility for assets, copied to / liaising with a BIS point
person. In most cases this is expected to BIS Finance although where there is a clear
policy lead within BIS they could be an alternative.

[ Formally delegating certain other functions to ShEx ]

There are situations whereby Mark Russell or others in ShEx provide line management
to senior executives and provide the appraisal / performance monitoring to non-
Executives.

Similarly, there are also situations where ShEx signs contracts on behalf of BIS SofS
such as for Royal Mail Pension Assets and the ICR Student Loans.

In both cases, our preference is for ShEx to continue to fulfil this role but under a
formal delegation from BIS Perm Sec to Mark Russell to help ensure clarity and the
propriety of these matters.

The alternative, of transferring these functions to BIS, risks creating unnecessary work
that ShEx would be happy to perform.

Other points to agree as part of the move to UKGI:
1. Establishing a timeline for any transition

Given the degree of change some of this will entail, we recommend that set out a
clear timetable when changes in our and others roles will take place.

2. Continuation of ShEx projects

ShEx currently works with BIS on a range of projects and these are expected to
continue subject to review against future ShEx criteria for projects.

cease over time.
