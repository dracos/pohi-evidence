Subject: Revised minute

Hi Tim,

Please find attached the revised minutes (minute 7.) with track changes.

As mentioned, f’ve contacted David Calvert-Smith to ask if he has sent his memo to Peters & Peters and to say that I can

circulate anything he needs circulated to the Board.

POL-0103695
POL00104112
POL00104112

On the tracking of actions, i'll set up a separate action fog for these meetings. I’ve sought to incorporate Tom’s ask to
look “at whether recommended actions (eg by the QCs) were not completed or only partially completed” in the
revised minute

Best wishes

Veronica

2 further comments from me on reading the minutes:

1. We discussed reviewing the role that Fujitsu played and whether or not they need to be included in any
legal proceedings in the closed session with David Culvert-Smith. The action to take this forward was
for DC-S to speak with Peters & Peters. Given this is in the closed session minutes how are we going to
keep track of this workstream?

2. On the information that the Board has access to prior to the GLO, I thought we also suggested that we
have a list of the documents that were shared with Board (asking you to go through the packs). Ken and
I do not recall anything (& I can find nothing in my searches)

Finally, I think there is a typo in page 1 of Appendix I minute 6 first bullet point under “A number of points
were raised...” should be “DC-S noted that ....”

Thanks

I’ve got a few points on the minutes from the last meeting.

In the matters resolved in para 7 it mentions a route map of decisions leading to the GLO and makes specific
reference to who knew about the Deloitte report.

I'd like to clarify that the “who knew about” question should apply to the various pieces of work commissioned:
- following POL’s response to the 2nd Second Sight report

- following termination of the Mediation Scheme

- following the Jonathan Swift QC report

Although not discussed explicitly last week, I hope we can agree also to look at whether recommended actions
(eg by the QCs) were not completed or only partially completed. A good example is the Deloitte report which as
I understand it only addressed the Horizon system since 2010 notwithstanding the QC’s recommendation to

look at remote access over the life of the Horizon system.

I think we also asked Tim to report back on what his recollection is as to what discussions too place with
management - presumably Paula and Jane - regarding which of these matters should be discussed at the Board.
