Subject: Requested meeting with James Arbuthnot MP
Importance: High

Dear Avene

Last Friday James sent a letter to Paula requesting a meeting. Could you please give me a
call at the earliest possible opportunity to arrange. I must let you know that we are now
receiving calls from numerous journalists about the mediation scheme and so this meeting is
a matter of considerable urgency.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Best wishes,
Janet
