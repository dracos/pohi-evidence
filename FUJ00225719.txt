Andy

As you know, these returns are re-runs of work you have already completed; 3 out of the 12 of your returns contained
duplicate transactions, all (48-59) need to be re-presented on one disc. They are due in Court on 20 September; we
have to get them to Salford and they, in turn, have to relay to the investigator, so we need to get them in the post
today.

In order to get these out as quickly as possible I asked Raj to re-run them for you. If you really are unhappy to take
ownership of the work she has completed on your behalf please could you re-run them yourself; Raj can show you the
fast ARQ process which really is not onerous at all. You will then need to update your witness statement. The disc
and statement need to be in the post today, please.

Kind regards
Penny

Penny,

Andy has checked the information on the disk, but with regards to the witness statement mentioned that I would
need to compile this as I have ran the retrievals off, please advise whether I would need to do this.

Thanks,
Raj

Hi Andy,

Just spoken to Maureen and the data for Kirkoswald needs to be resent as this had duplicated data. I
have re-ran the reports for you, so please can you check and get these sent to POL, also I understand
that these also require the Witness Statements as well so please can you get this done as we will need
to get this out ASAP as this will be going to court on the 20" Sept.

Also do you know where the PGP files were for the set of reports that you produced originally as they
need to be copied over to the NAS and we cannot locate them on the D Drive, could these be on your
desktop?

Many Thanks,
Raj
