Dear Sirs

POST OFFICE GROUP LITIGATION
DEFENDANT'S DISCLOSURE - REDACTED DOCUMENTS

We write further to your third letter of today’s date.

Thank you for confirming that a claim for privilege is the basis on which these redactions have been
made.

We do however remain concerned about these redactions and whether too wide an approach has
been adopted to the process of redacting PO’s documents. We do not understand how the document
title of G/40 could properly be redacted on the basis provided, nor the varying approach throughout
that document to redacting selected words in some paragraphs (e.g. the introduction), and complete
other paragraphs e.g. under the heading “Technical” (which itself seems unlikely to be a place where
legal advice would be recorded).

We invite you please to reconsider these redactions, and confirm to us that (1) your trial counsel
have reviewed each of these redactions and the reasons given for them, and (2) the person within
your firm with control of the disclosure process has done likewise, and (3) as a result of these
reviews, whether any redactions may be removed.

Please provide your response by 4pm on Tuesday 23 October 2018. We will then further consider
the Claimants’ position.
