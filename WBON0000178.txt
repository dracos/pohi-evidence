Pete

I'm currently working with Andy on preparing a detailed witness statement on all documents / data that Post Office has
access to that is relevant to the Group Action.

I'd really appreciate your input on a couple of points. Do you have any availability in the next few days for a call to
discuss the following?

¢ — How long it would take for FJ to extract all of the branch data for all 515 Claimants, who have 612 branches
between them

« How many different changes have been made to Horizon since it was introduced — is there a total number of
change requests or a version number for the software code?

« How many manuals, system documents, technical documents etc. do you hold that explain Horizon and are
there different versions of these?

e  Asense of scale of how many people at FJ have worked on Horizon and how many data / documents they
will have produced

« What records are kept about bugs, how they are kept and whether these are searchable by branch affected

« What the bug escalation process is

Kind regards,
Elisa
