Claimants’ Current Position

Post Office Response

Contractual documents between
Post Office and the postmasters and
Crown officers since 1998.

Copies of the contracts and
variations will be provided as per
Schedule 5.

We await the documents you agree
to provide, and have no further
request at this stage.

Documents were provided on 31 August
2016.

Contractual documents between
Post Office and ICL/Fujitsu from
1999 to present.

A redacted version (removing
commercially sensitive data) of the
latest version of the core
agreement and relevant schedules

will be provided as per Schedule 6.

We await the documents you agree
to provide, and have no further
request at this stage.

Documents were provided on 31 August
2016.

Documents containing or referring to
non-contractual understandings,
practices, policies, guidance or
memoranda relating to the
relationship Post Office and
ICL/Fujitsu and/or ICL/Fujitsu's
performance.

In circumstances where you have.
not particularised any factual basis
on which Horizon is defective,
disclosure of these documents (if
they exist) is not relevant,
reasonable or proportionate.

In any event, the volume of
documents that may need to be
considered in order to respond to
this vague and highly generalised
request would be significant.
These documents will also not be
located in one place. A full
disclosure exercise would be
required to locate these
documents.

See covering letter.

As a minimum, please disclose any
policy or guidance document issued
to ICL / Fujitsu:

1. concerning the specific defects
referred to in Schedule 6 of your
Letter of Response; and

2. concerning other defects which
may have resulted in losses to
branch accounts over the period
1999 to present, not currently
referred to in Schedule 6 of your
Letter of Response.

We refer to our previous explanation. A full
disclosure exercise would be required to
locate these documents.

In respect of your requests:

1. The core documents, which we are
currently aware of, relating to these
specific defects were provided on 31
August 2016. To locate any further
documents that may exist would
require a full disclosure exercise and
would not be reasonable or
proportionate to carry out at this stage.

2. This request is clearly a fishing
expedition and our client is not willing
to entertain your request or provide
these documents without further
particularisation.

If there is a particular defect that you
wish us to provide documents in

Operations manual(s) for Horizon —
1999 to present.

Post Office has no objection to
providing the current version of the
Operations manual. However, this
document is ordinarily accessible
via Horizon and so is not held in a
readily accessible format that can
easily be provided to your firm. We
are investigating further how this
document may be disclosed to you.

Providing historic documents would
require a full disclosure exercise.
This is neither reasonable nor
proportionate at this time.

Please confirm you have now
identified how to provide the current
version of the Operations manual
and you will do so without delay.

Please also provide a copy of the
Operations manual as at 1 January
2006 such that we at least have a
snapshot of the historic position.

We have attempted to export the
Operations Manual, however due to the
Operations Manual being hosted online and
the volume of documents contained within
the Operations Manual, to produce either a
hard or soft copy version would require a
full disclosure exercise, which at this stage
is not reasonable or proportionate.

Although we have been unable to export a
copy of the Operations Manual, please find
enclosed a copy of the index. The
documents provided show the front page of
the Operations Manual (as seen by the
Postmaster) and the manuals which are
contained under each of these sections.

If there are specific entries on which you
want disclosure, please provide details and
we will consider the relevance,
reasonableness and proportionality of
those requests. Alternatively, if you wish
for us to arrange an opportunity for you to
review the Operations Manual via Horizon
please let us know.

A snapshot of the Operations Manual as at
1 January 2006 would not have been
previously made or kept. It may be
possible to piece together a snapshot of the
Operations Manual as at this date however
it would be time consuming and
disproportionate to do so.

In any event, please could you provide an
explanation of the relevance of 1 January
2006. We note that this date falls outside
