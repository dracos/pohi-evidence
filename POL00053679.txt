Dear Sir

REGINA v PETER ANTHONY HOLMES
NEWCASTLE CROWN COURT
MENTION - 14™ DECEMBER 2009

Following Counsel's telephone call to this Office on 8" December 2009, the
Investigation Officer has confirmed that he has considered the documents provided
by the Defence and I enclose a copy of his response below:-

“I have looked at the documents provided and compared them to the
deposits in to the Bank Accounts. Whereas there are a few anomalies they
work both ways, therefore I could find no sufficient evidence to bring any part
of the Experts Report in to question.

This only leaves the Inland Revenue check that has been requested and I
am unable to establish at present if it will be available in time. This has been
requested to ascertain what account, if any, Peter Holmes’ Police Pension is
paid in to. Are we in a position to put the question to the Defence if the
Inland Revenue check does not arrive? If not or if it does arrive and no other
account is identified, then there is nothing further I could consider to assist
with the.theft charge”.

Should Counsel require anything further please contact this Office.
