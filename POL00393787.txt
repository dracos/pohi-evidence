1.0 PURPOSE

The purpose of this report is to provide information regarding management of
the live environment and the effects of Horizon on individual business units.
The critical success factors (CSF’s) within the report are intended to highlight
the impacts on areas of key performance as defined by business units.

It is really about where we are ‘feeling, the pain’ - as historical data builds up
we will be able to analyse and report trends more effectively.

This report also contains performance statistics for the Horizon System
Helpdesk (HSH) and Network Business Support Centre (NBSC) to provide
visibility of potential problems. These will be analysed in relation to the CSF’s
to identify potential links, which in turn will feed into the service
improvement process.

The Horizon Service Review Framework provides a basis for improvements
on Service failures to be progressed.

Comments

- First tranche of staff in post to cope with the increase from Horizon offices now. Staff on a panel for the increases expected during April & May 2000.

- Extra staff numbers forecast in July, August and September onwards due to the latest increases in the length of the learning curve. However, restricting the learning curve to an
analysis of the errors produced in the last 15 weeks, indicates the latest extra staff numbers forecast to be closer to the original.

- More staff will be required at the end of the roll out timetable for extra on-going work (completing table 12 parcel income figures) on Horizon offices now.

‘Comment
“This is a revised learning curve based on errors produced in the last 15 weeks at Horizon offices. The height of this curve is not as severe during the early stages after

‘conversion as that previously used.

- The length of the current learning curve is at least 20 weeks and the level of outlets in the sample gives confidence that this is statistically sound. The tal of the learning
‘curve remains well above the baseline for over 20 weeks after conversion. I this continues, then the effect on TP extends to September 2001

- From the limited information available for converted offices at the moment, the learning curve is assumed to return to the manual baseline after 30 weeks.

Comments

The main cause of the problem is that many tables on the Cash Account are not mandatory for completion and some postmasters are realising this,

once the account has been printed, thus the information has not been captured.

Impact

* Extra resource needed to input data into the system.
* Client Information distorted if not completed.
* Postmasters pay impacted - knock on effect could be more challenges on remuneration to TP

Recent figures show a considerable improvement over earlier months

PROBLEM MANAGEMENT - Business Service Management

Problem Management enables us to keep up to date with any problems or concerns
regarding the Horizon System. A problem is formed by a regular occurrence of a
similar incident which is then transferred to Problem Management from the Incident
Management team. Not all problems are included in this summary however details
are available on request.

A summary of P.O.C.L’s problem database at the end of February is shown in the
table below. This data is retrieved on a monthly basis by a problem manager and
then analysed by a member of the Supplier Performance Team.

forms tobe IWong I 31/05/2000 I problem further and raise the existing embargo on the remaining Horizon
used on offices not using, the Ecco+ style PDR’s (2,277), the following, was agreed.
Horizon
system * Existing Horizon offices not using the PDR’s will be rolled out at the rate
(PDR’s) of 200 per week, w/c from 8 May. Error rates will be monitored by

Girobank and fed back to PON. Rollout will be dependant on error rates
proving acceptable.

* 42,000 Greyscale print guides will be produced and laminated to maintain
colour stability and be issued to HFSOs/trainers/etc. However final
agreement on the form itself needs to be finalised. Deliveries will be by
the middle of May for distribution by Swindon.

Current error rates were discussed with evidence of presentation mistakes.

A high incidence of reversal problems were shown on the accompanying

paperwork. Investigation of further evidence to be provided by Giro will be

carried out to determine what the root cause is.

Service Reporting,

The outcome of the meeting was extremely positive, however, this could

be jeopardised by the following:

¢ Internal Account Management agreement to the deployment of the
greyscale print guide, there is concern that this will result in the
printer ribbons being, changed too frequently when they appear to be
acceptable to the human eye.

© The stock levels of PDR’s in Swindon is causing concern and cannot
be maintained in accordance to the roll-out schedule.

Assuming the above two concerns can be managed then this problem
will change status to ‘monitor’ and the reintroduction of the PDR
managed by the Business Service Management Change implementation
team.

8.0 Non conformance
(Des Hansbury : Problem Management)

1. Polling

ISSUE: ICL Pathway are continuing to press their belief that at a large number of offices
the power to the Horizon equipment is deliberately turned off when the offices are closed.

Daily information is now being received from ICL Pathway on offices which are assumed
to have switched off their Horizon processor. For offices failing to poll, Pathway compare
message store entries showing that a reboot has occurred with HSH call records. Ifa
reboot has taken place with no associated HSH call recorded, it is assumed by Pathway
that the office has switched the processor off.

A telephone survey was undertaken of 15 offices listed on the reports for 29" to 31%
March. No evidence was found to support the Pathway case. In all but one case the
subpostmaster was able to provide an explanation for the non polling. As previously, the
most common reason was a power failure.

In addition Pathway recently presented details of offices that had failed to poll over the
weekend on more than one occasion during the period 14 February to 27 March. Fourteen
of the offices had experienced more than two failures. Of these 13 were contacted. Again,
in most cases, the subpostmaster was able to provide an explanation. Only one case of non
conformance was identified; one that we had already raised with the appropriate
Territory.

Overall the polling failure rate remains low as illustrated in the table below. It is based
upon first day polling failures occurring on Sunday to Thursday each week.

2. Order Book Control Service (OBCS )
ISSUE: Pathway have reported that a large number of offices are not registering, Benefits

Agency (BA ) order books on the Horizon System. This impacts on our contract with the
Benefits Agency.

All bar coded BA order books should be scanned on the day they are received in an office.
ICL Pathway provided a list of 316 offices that had not scanned any order books during
February. These offices represent 10% of the automated network as of the end of February.

To date 296 of these offices have been contacted in order to establish why the order books
had not been registered on the system and to ensure the correct procedure is followed.

The following, table summarises the reasons given for failing, to scan the order books.

Telephone Survey Results

_Reason for 1 i ercentage
System / scanning problems - gave up trying 14
Told not to scan at training, 46
Told not to scan by HFSO 10
Have been scanning books post Feb. 4
Stopped scanning alter receiving, 12
communication
Incorrect procedure 9
Stated they have always scanned books 4
New spmir. - not aware of need to scan 1

The reasons given mainly revolve around communication issues and demonstrate the
need to monitor that procedures are understood and being followed whenever temporary
arrangements are in place. If a communication is long and involved as in this case the
main actions need further emphasis, perhaps by means of bullet points in an introduction.
A significant number of offices actually stopped receipting books alter reading the cascade
advising them that this was the only part of the control procedure they should be
actioning.

Many offices had first hand experience of the problems that occurred with the order book
bar codes and lost confidence in the system. A communication apologizing for the
problems and informing outlets that they had been resolved would have increased the
level of conformance by such offices whilst at the same time getting the message across to
any trainers or HFSOs who may have been telling people that the facility didn’t work.

Conformance in this area should improve significantly because, since 3 April, all new
Horizon offices have been allowed to follow the original OBCS procedures (apart from
one variation ) and 328 of the existing, automated offices have been ‘ re-enlivened ‘. The
remainder will be‘ re-enlivened ‘ by the end of May if ongoing monitoring demonstrates
that we are able to meet a level of conformance acceptable to the Benefits Agency.

Traffic Light System

Each CSF has at least one measure attached to it. These are shown in blocks and
each block of measures are weighted at 100%. If all are equally important in the
block the 100% is divided across the block of measures. This system works well in
areas like OSG where there are distinct differences in the importance of each
measure. The traffic lights are then used to show the total of the weighting. For
example if a CSF has a number of low graded measures on red but the higher ones
are all on green this suggests that there are no major issues affecting the CSF and
therefore the overall traffic light for that CSF would be green. However in
Transaction Processing all the CSF’s are equally important which means that if any
of the measures are adversely affected the impact is high on TP.
