1 Introduction

This document details the Direct Interface Test Specification between
Pathway AP System and POCL HAPS System. It identifies the requirements
that will be used to accomplish direct interface testing between POCL and
Pathway, as such this document must be owned and approved by POCL,
Pathway and the PDA.

2 Scope

The scope of Direct Interface Testing is to ensure that the system interface
between Pathway APS and POCL HAPS works at both the technical and
application level. It excludes end-to-end, model office rehearsal and model
Office test.

Direct Interface Testing only covers the transition of transaction data,
captured at the APS counter, from Pathway Central Systems to HAPS (shown
within dotted lines).

Legacy Systems HAPS APACHI

Key:

Legacy represents the provision of the Automated Payments Service using

Systems Automated Payments Terminals, ECCO equipment or ALPS
equipment.

HAPS is the Host Automated Payments System operated by IT SERVICES
on behalf of POCL.

APACHI is the Automated Payments at Chesterfield Interface, the link to
POCL’s client accounting and settlement processes.

DPC is the Document Processing Centre, the location at which paper
Automated Payments sales vouchers are converted into electronic
format.

AP Clients is the base of Automated Payments Clients on behalf of whom
business is conducted at Post Office outlets.

APS is the Pathway Automated Payments Service at Post Office outlets.

Counter

Pathway represents the systems, located outside Post Office outlets, that

Overview

Direct interface testing is to ensure that the Pathway AP System and
the POCL HAPS System operate in accordance with the ‘Pathway to
HAPS Interface Specification’. Interface testing must satisfy a
successful file transfer taking place and ensure the contents of the files
includes data to support the Interface Specification. Thus the DIT
objective is to prove the interface only.

Architecture

Pathway will have a system test configuration consisting of a Sequent
Server (the Host) and a Correspondence Server supporting several
outlets, at least one outlet having more than one counter position. All
system testing will be carried out by Pathway testers under the
direction of the Pathway System Test Manager. It will encompass
operation at a variety of outlets & counter positions.

FAD Codes.
The valid FAD Code to be used in the testing interface file header
record is 9990771.

The valid outlet FAD codes to be used are dependant on the
Reference Data Project provided by POCL in Chesterfield. Outlets will
be constructed using these FAD codes and the information supplied to
HAPS prior to commencing Direct Interface Tests.

Steps

The tests encompass the following steps.
e Perform counter transactions on the Pathway test cells.

e Harvest the transactions on to the Oracle Host and generate a
transmission file.

e Send the transmission file from the Gateway PC at Feltham to the
Gateway PC at Farnborough via Wigan, making the AP
transmission file available to POCL HAPS.

e POCL HAPS rename the files to notify Pathway that the files have
been transferred successfully.

e Check the integrity and content of the file conforms to the AIS.
3.5 Testing Requirements

3.5.1 Counter Level Tests
e A swiped magnetic card transaction, paid by cash.
e A keyed magnetic card transaction, paid by cash.
e A swiped magnetic card transaction, paid by cheque.
e Akeyed magnetic card transaction, paid by cheque.

e A swiped magnetic card transaction, paid by cash, that has
been reversed.

« Areversal of the above transaction.

e A keyed magnetic card transaction, paid by cheque, that has
been reversed.

« Reversal of the above transaction.

e Ascanned bar code transaction, paid by cash.

e A keyed bar code transaction, paid by cash.

e Ascanned bar code transaction, paid by cheque.
e A keyed bar code transaction, paid by cheque.

e A scanned bar code transaction, paid by cheque, that has
been reversed.

« Reversal of the above transaction.

e A keyed bar code transaction, paid by cash, that has been
reversed.

« Reversal of the above transaction.

e A magnetic card recovery transaction.

e A magnetic card fall back recovery transaction.
e A bar coded bill recovery transaction.

e A bar coded bill fall back recovery transaction.

The above transactions will be captured from more than one Post Office
outlet. Transactions will be for more than one client including multiple
schemes for a client that has many schemes. Counter transactions will
performed on different days although included in the same file. Additionally
some transactions will be captured at a Post Office outlet that has not had its
end of day marker set for seven days.

3.5.2 File Level Tests

e Large transfer file (i.e. maximum size as defined in the
interface specification ref 0.2.4).

e Null transfer file (ie. header and trailer only).

e File of magnetic card transactions only. (Including reversed
and reversal transactions.)

e File of bar code transactions only. (Including reversed and
reversal transactions.)

e File of mixed magnetic card and bar code transactions.
(Including reversed and reversal transactions.)

« More than one transfer file.

e Duplicate transmission i.e. same file sent twice with the same
file name.

e Transfer file sent out of sequence.

e Break in transmission of transfer file.

e Re-transmission of above file to same gateway PC.

3.1.4 Documentation Required To Support The Tests

e Detailed transaction report per office per test day.
« APS reconciliation reports.

« Test timetable showing the days on which HAPS is required
for Direct Interface Testing.

e Test schedule showing the tests that will be performed on
each day, their sequence and their duration.

« Specific Automated Payments Clients lists to be provided by
POCL.

Fault Reporting

Each party will use its own fault reporting system. Pathway will log any
incidents using the fault reporting system PinICL. The incident number will be
passed back for future progression and clearance.

IT SERVICES will fax details of incidents raised to Pathway, if any incidents
are found to be software or hardware faults these will be entered into PinICL.
A copy of the PinICL report will be faxed to HAPS.

A weekly testing progress meeting to be held during DIT.

Entry Criteria

The criteria for entry to DIT are:

. All hardware installed, tested and commissioned as per
Pathway to HAPS Interface Specification, Reference 0.2.4.
