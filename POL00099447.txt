Janet

tam looking forward to our meeting tomorrow and was proposing to take the time to discuss the mediation process
which has been agreed with the JFSA and SS. I thought it might be useful to let you have the documentation before we
meet, we have spilt this into three sections which equate to the different stages in the process; the first pack describes
the initial registration phase, the second the investigation phase and the finally the third focuses on the mediation
phase.

See you tomorrow
Regards

Susan
