Subject: RE: The "dossier"
Patrick — here are my proposed responses on the CPS and Limitation points:
CPS

17 Dec 2014 : Column 527WH, Mr David Jones (Clwyd West) (Con): “Is it a matter of concern
to my right hon. Friend, as it is to me, that all the Post Office prosecutions have been conducted
in-house? The Crown Prosecution Service has not been consulted, and therefore there has been
no element of independent scrutiny prior to the prosecutions’ commencement.”

Andrew Bridgen (North West Leicestershire) (Con): “Will my right hon. Friend confirm that the
Post Office is able to bring criminal prosecutions in cases that have already gone to the Crown
Prosecution Service, even if the CPS believes that there are insufficient grounds for a
prosecution?”

Mr Arbuthnot: “As my hon. Friend suggests, and as my hon. and learned Friend the Member for
North East Hertfordshire (Sir Oliver Heald) suggested earlier, it is becoming increasingly
untenable for the Post Office to act as its own prosecutor without the independent look that the
Crown Prosecution Service would bring. My impression is that the Post Office shares that view,
and the sooner it can get rid of its responsibility to prosecute—I believe it should happen today—
the better.”

[Introductory statement about how much (public) cash we have in the network to provide the
justification for prosecuting?]

When confronted by criminal conduct within its network, Post Office can exercise the statutory
right to bring a private prosecution open to all persons in England and Wales under the
Prosecution of Offences Act 1985, or by supplying evidence to the national prosecutors in
Scotland and Northern Ireland (where a private prosecution cannot be brought).

In deciding whether a case is suitable for prosecution, Post Office considers (among other
factors) whether it meets the tests set out in the Code for Crown Prosecutors. That Code is
issued by the Director of Public Prosecutions and followed by Crown Prosecutors. Post Office
does not have to inform the CPS that a private prosecution has commenced, but the CPS can take
over a private prosecution if circumstances warrant. Like the CPS, Post Office keeps cases
under continuous review all the way up to and during any trial, and can effectively stop a
prosecution by “offering no evidence” where appropriate.

POL-0111096
POLO0109860
POL00109860

When Post Office decides to prosecute a case, its conduct of the prosecution is scrutinised by
defence lawyers and ultimately by the Courts themselves.

Statute of Limitations

17 Dec 2014 : Column 532WH, Mr Arbuthnot: “..... I hope the Government can prevent the Post
Office from pleading the statute of limitations, because sub-postmasters’ legal actions—some of
them caused by the behaviour of the Post Office—should not be barred by the passage of time.”

Limitation periods for bringing legal actions are a long and firmly established part of the

law. The periods, currently established by the Limitation Act 1980, balance the interests of the
claimant (who may need time to bring a claim) and the defendant (who must be protected from
stale claims, e.g. because relevant materials are no longer available).

The limitation defence is available to all defendants, no matter how strong the claim they are
asked to answer. Post Office, uniquely among defendants, should not be prevented from
exercising this legal right.

The Scheme does not affect postmasters’ legal rights, including the right to start Court
proceedings if they believe their case has merit. Many of the complaints in the Scheme are very
old, with the typical 6 year limitation period expiring well before the Scheme was

established. Many postmasters received advice on their complaints before the limitation period
expired, and Post Office has paid for postmasters in the Scheme to receive support from
professional advisors who can help with any limitation issues.

Subject: RE: The "dossier"

Tom

We spoke.

Some of Mark’s questions fall into the technical and I’d very much welcome Rod’s advice on
another two, as below:

For techhie:

- JA suggestion that at the end of the day, accounts were sometimes over, and sometimes
under, and changing balances between a Sat and a Monday

- JA suggestion about discrepancies doubling following helpline advice

- Calls to helpline abandoned (10s of thousand)

- 25% cut to support staff

- Horizon was ‘second hand’ and designed for other purposes

For Rod please:

- The specific Bridgen accusation that we bring criminal cases even when CPS has advised
against

- Statute of limitations

I think there is something of a limit to the number of accusations we can expect the dossier to
cover, not in the sense that there are so many (although there are), but some just don’t really lend
themselves to an easy answer: for instance, it seems highly improbable that a discrepancy would
double as the direct result of a call to the Helpline - what would have doubled it, presumably,
were the actions taken by the relevant SPM following the call but this then becomes case-

specific and off bounds.

Most of the others will simply involve adding to your draft which, as we noted yesterday, is
already in good shape.

Speak later

Thanks Mark — really helpful.

Some of it is covered (eg the substance of Rudkin if not as a named case) but your suggestions
are probably a level of detail below that I originally pitched at. Now we have the shorter version,
I think a more detailed rebuttal probably is the way to go. A fair amount of this is in Second
Sight’s questions so we’ll get on to it.

Cc others for info and the potential need for help

Hi Tom

This looks very good.

Apologies if I have missed these points as I have read through but if they are not there could we
directly respond to the following as well:

- The Rudkin case

- JA suggestion that at the end of the day, accounts were sometimes over, and sometimes
under, and changing balances between a Sat and a Monday

- JA suggestion about discrepancies doubling following helpline advice

- The specific Bridgen accusation that we bring criminal cases even when CPS has advised
against

- Have we covered off sufficiently the JA suggestion that we have broken ‘agreement’ with
MPs re range of the scheme?

- -‘set out to sabotage’ — I think we need to specifically rebut this

POL-0111096
- Lost or destroyed documents

- Calls to helpline abandoned (10s of thousand)
- 25% cut to support staff

- Put it in an envelope

- Statute of limitations

- Horizon was ‘second hand’ and designed for other purposes

All
With thanks to Belinda and Mel for their input so far, please find a first draft dossier
attached. This would be for the us to offer to the Minister to place in Parliament and for us to

use with MPs ete / publicly.

Please note: As colleagues are still commenting on the “short version” there will need to be a
reconciliation of the two documents mostly for style / language rather than substance.

All comments welcome.
Thanks
