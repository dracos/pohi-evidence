Hi Amy

Thanks for picking this up. Paragraphs 170-174 of the attached are relevant for the purposes of the PIDA research. A

short note summarising the Act and particularly the test for “protected disclosures” would be very useful.

You will see if you have the chance to read the full letter that there are various references to the Official Secrets Act —
there will be some research on this subject to follow this week but I need to do some digging first to find out why POL

refer to the OSA in their standard contracts.

Thanks

Paul
