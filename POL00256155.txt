information from his own

The processes for how
Post Office and Fujitsu

ultimately the code versioning

these are shared amongst?

1.1(a) and 1.1(b) should be

1.4

Regarding POL-0032932.doc,

what is the purpose of setting an
NB102 exception to F99 by Fu?

Post Office will ask Fujitsu
to explain the purpose of
setting an NB102 exception
to F99.

Satisfied that Fujitsu will
be asked to explain the
cause, awaiting further
information.

When there is an incident involving a reconciliation
exception in Network Banking which has been fully
processed, then the transaction needs to be set to
F99 to indicate that processing is complete.
Therefore, this is done for any transaction that
appears in a reconciliation report, once the resolution
is complete.

The reconciliation process document is

how reconciliation is carried out.

With regard to “ how

request. If it is answered

not delivered to the counter so the SPM believes that
the transaction in fact failed due to some issue.

Fujitsu have advised that reference data, like all parts
of the Horizon system, is subject to regular support
incidents being raised which require some form of
resolution. "Live Peak fixes" could therefore relate to
a number of situations that have no connection to the
Horizon Issues or the idea of bugs or errors in branch
accounts. This request is therefore too wide to be
properly understood and / or it is irrelevant to the

As to request (c), Horizon Issue 4 asks "to what
extent has there been potential for errors in data
recorded within Horizon to arise in (a) data entry, (b)

Request 4.1(c) goes beyond this by asking how
(unspecified) errors have been dealt with. This
request therefore relate to a subject matter that is not
covered by the Horizon Issues.

Furthermore, this question is too vague to answer. It
is not understood what "errors" are under scrutiny
and what is meant by them being “dealt with".

Even if these points could be better defined, this
question is disproportionately wide. It would require a
review of all Post Office and Fujitsu operations over
an 18 year period, significant disclosure and the
interviewing of dozens of potential witnesses.

Response satisfactory,
awaiting further
information from Fujitsu.

Fujitsu has advised that the discrepancies described
are related to banking and payments reconciliation.
There were a lot of discrepancies identified in NB102
reports relating to kiosk transactions and there was
an issue that because they were not being cleared
down (ie set to state F99), then it was difficult to
distinguish new discrepancies from old ones.

These discrepancies would have had no impact on
Branch Accounts as they are related to Post Office's
reconciliation with Banks.

that Fujitsu should be able
to explain what situation led
to the process outlined in
POL-0032939 (TPS —

Post Office will ask Fujitsu
to do so.

The request for Post Office
to describe how many
transactions have been
repaired is a factual
question and Post Office
would need to interrogate
the whole of its business to
attempt to answer them
because the information is
very unlikely to have been
pooled or collated for this
particular purpose.

It should also be noted that
POL-0032939 is a Fujitsu
document and one of the
100 technical documents
provided to Mr Coyne. A
further 110,000 such
documents have now been
disclosed to Mr Coyne and

RFI I Mr Coyne's Request Post Office's Initial Mr Coyne's Response Post Office's Response Pursuant to Paragraph 1
Response to Post Office of the Fifth CMC Order
4.3 I Please describe what situation Post Office understands I do not believe the Fujitsu has advised that the transaction repairs were

missing mandatory attributes (in the receiving
systems) — particularly for Mails-based transactions,
and there was a process for manually correcting
these transactions before they were passed to Post
Office. This would have no impact on the Branch
accounts and no changes were made to Branch
Transactions — it affected information needed by back
end systems.

POL-0032939.doc relates to fixes made in TPS and
so have no impact on Branch accounts. The main
situation that led to the process was transactions
missing mandatory attributes and this sometimes
occurred with Mails transactions on old Horizon.
Such malformed transactions were permissible as far
as the counter and branch accounting were
concerned, but not complete enough for Post Office
back end systems.

Please also see:
POL-0032939
POL-0149393

Post Office objects to that part of the question that
requires it to quantify the number of repair.

This information is not needed because this topic
does not affect branch accounts.

Furthermore, Fujitsu does not presently hold
information on the number of repaired transactions. It
would therefore require a manual review and collation
of this data to provide the requested information.

This would be disproportionate.

of the Fifth CMC Order

5.1

Please provide a list of all data
sources outside of Horizon that
have led to discrepancies
between the external data
source and branch accounts of
which a comparison with data
inside Horizon is required.

This is not within scope of
Issue 5, which is how
Horizon itself compares
transaction data recorded
by Horizon against
transaction data from
sources outside of Horizon.

In any event, to answer this
question Post Office would
need to identify every
external data source that
feeds data into Horizon and
then review those data
feeds to see if there has
ever been a discrepancy
between any of them and
any transaction recorded in
any of 10,000+ branches
within the Post Office
network (presumably over
an 18 year period) in order
to then identify the data
sources that have
encountered a discrepancy.
To give this a sense of
scale, it is noted that
Horizon processes around
6,000,000 transactions per
day. The scale of this
exercise would be
enormous.

Wording amended.
Response still required. It
is expected that this is a
simple question to
respond to as an up to

should be available.

Post Office objects to this request for the reasons
previously stated.

documents may be of assistance:

Fujitsu has advised that their systems were designed
to manage individual operations not for statistical

by a Support Consultant.

This request would therefore require a manual review
and collation of this data to provide the requested

Fujitsu has advised that it does not hold this

7.4 I POL-0032939.doc references a Post Office understands Response satisfactory, Fujitsu has supplied the following document

reference:

DES/APP/HLD/0020 Branch Database High Level
Design

In relation to how such modification was audited and
how the audit files are updated, Fujitsu has advised
that:

The tool can only be used on data that has failed to
be delivered between the Branch Database
(previously Horizon) and the TPS system. This data
is quarantined within the TPS system until the
Transaction Repair tool corrects it. The correction is
made on the TPS database and cannot directly affect
the branch accounts in the Branch Database (or
previously, Horizon).

Once corrected the transaction data flows to
Credence and POLSAP.

The corrected data is stored in TPS for 36 days and
then archived on the TPS audit sub-point. Only the
copy of the corrected record is kept but, if necessary,
this can always be compared with the counter audit to
see what has been modified.

In relation to how often such a tool was used:

There is a master MSC every 12 months, each time
such a modification is carried out it is itemised as an
MSC related to the master MSC; however master
MSCs contain many various types of changes, to
determine the number that relate to this particular
modification type Fujitsu would have to carry out

Whilst this type of action may have been taken by
SSC it would have been in the context of an individual
incident. All incidents are recorded but the system
was designed to manage individual operations not for
statistical reporting for when a particular action has
been taken by a Support Consultant. Fujitsu will be
able to answer questions on individual branch queries

In response to 7.5(b): Prior to Transaction
Corrections, branches were required to manually
enter Error Notices into Horizon which were sent to
them on paper. Error Notices would be accompanied
by evidence (which would change depending on the
type of transaction that required correcting). These
were manually completed by the SPM (i.e. manually
entered on to Horizon). However, once the change
took place, then the Transaction Correction would be
issued via Horizon and the branch would be required
to accept then settle centrally.

Fujitsu have advised that while the term ‘ coenter
log’ is ambiguous, none of the reports available to a
Subpostmaster match the description ‘ coenter
log’

When investigating a reported issue a number of
different logs on the counter may be uploaded from
the counter to aid diagnosis — but these are not
specifically error logs. These logs would be accessed
as appropriate to the investigation in hand.

In our letter to Freeths dated 28 September 2017 we
explained that "The postofficecounterlog and
messagelog (the Logs) are sometimes used by
Fujitsu for, amongst other things, diagnostic
purposes. For example, when a postmaster reports a
technical issue to the Horizon Service Desk (HSD) it
may be appropriate to use these logs to investigate
the operation of Horizon in a particular branch. The
Horizon system does not use the contents of the Logs
for the purposes of branch accounting. The Logs are
held on the terminal for a period of 30 days, following

The Logs are only considered in limited situations
where a postmaster alleges a technical issue which is
telated to the Horizon hardware and which would not
otherwise have been resolved. If your clients had
taised an issue of this nature in real time, then it
would have been possible to investigate the Logs as
