All

Following our discussion this morning, here is the latest and I hope final version of the letter to James Arbuthnot. It has
two changes:

- Anew line in square brackets about setting up a working group to examine support processes for spmrs
- Reduced section on definition of Horizon following advice from Hugh

Please can you come back on this asap.

Thank you

Mark
