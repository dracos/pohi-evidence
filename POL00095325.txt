Introduction

The Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE) is a key area of
legislation affecting Post Office Security Managers. The Codes of
Practice are the guidelines which Police Officers and others tasked
with investigating criminal offences have to follow.

There are five Codes of Practice covering all areas of investigation
work, and a detailed working knowledge of them is essential for
Security Managers to carry out their duties.

The importance of this module cannot be overestimated as all
interviews, searches and other areas of your duties have to be
conducted in accordance with the Codes of Practice. Failure to
comply with the Codes will inevitably lead to prosecutions being
unsuccessful.

Section L:.

The Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE), is the
legislation which defines how Police Officers and others should
investigate criminal offences.

You have received a copy of the Codes of Practice, which is
effectively the Security Manager's ‘bible’.

Before 1984 the conduct of investigations was controlled by the
“Judges Rules”. Because of various miscarriages of justice, PACE
was introduced to protect the rights of individuals and to provide
clear guidelines on how offenders/suspects should be treated,
questioned and searched. It also strengthened the safeguards of the
individual in respect of “Stop and search” powers.

Sections of PACE state that the Secretary of State shall issue

Codes of Practice which cover the following areas of investigations.
They are identified by the letters shown.

*CODEA: Stop and search

*CODEB: — Searching of premises and seizure of property
*CODEC: Detention, treatment and questioning of persons
*CODED: — Identification of persons

*CODEE: Tape recording of interviews

These Codes do not apply to Scottish Law. Northern Ireland,
however, has similar, but separate, Codes of Practice.

POL00095325
POL00095325

Section 1: I

Section 67 (9) of PACE states:

“Persons other than Police Officers who are charged with the
duty of investigating offences or charging offenders shall in the
discharge of that duty have regard to any relevant provision of
such a code.”

This simply means that any non-Police Law Enforcement Agency,
such as The Post Office, has to follow the same guidelines as the
Police when they carry out their duties.

The answer is that all Codes apply to The Post Office, as any
Law Enforcement Agency has to abide by the full Codes of
Practice.

However, the reality is that the following two Codes are not used in
general Post Office inquiries:

CODE A: Stop and search

CODE D: Identification of persons

This leaves three Codes which are crucial to your duty as a
Post Office Security Manager:

CODE B: — Searching of premises and seizure of property
CODEC: Detention, treatment and questioning of persons

CODE E: — Tape recording of interviews

Please glance through your Codes of Practice book to familiarise
yourself with the layout, and the way the topics contained in them are
presented. You will see that, unlike some of the more formal legal
documents, it is written in plain English!

The Codes of Practice must be readily available for anyone about to
be interviewed, and also for Security Managers to consult during
their inquiries. You will have seen at the end of many Sections there
are “Notes for Guidance”. These are not provisions of the Code, but
are intended to assist in their application and interpretation.

Please read Code B of the Codes of Practice booklet.
This is 12 pages long and covers all areas of searching.

One of the other modules in this Open Learning programme, the
Search module, covers searching and the forms that are required. In
this module we look again at the subject with specific reference to the
Codes of Practice.

The main aspects of searching which are covered by Code B are:

* Search warrants and production orders

* Entry without a warrant

* Search with consent

* General considerations when searching premises
+ Seizure and retention of property

* Action to be taken after searches

We now cover some key areas within these sections, followed by
activities to assist your familiarisation with the Code.

POL00095325
POL00095325

Section 2:

Most searches conducted by Post Office Security Managers are in
respect of Post Office employees, and are carried out with the consent
of the person concerned.

However, on some occasions it is necessary to obtain a search
warrant, but these have to be obtained by Police Officers acting on
information you supply to them. There is no authority for Post Office
Security Managers to obtain search warrants themselves.

Some Courts allow the words “Officers from The Post Office” to be
added to the warrant, and in those circumstances you are fully
authorised to accompany the Police into the premises. If possible, the
names of the Security Managers should be included in the quoted
section on a warrant.

The conditions under which Police Officers may enter and search
premises without a warrant are set out in Section 17 of PACE.

‘The powers of the Police to search premises occupied or controlled
by a person (generally their home) when they have been arrested
elsewhere is covered by Section 18 of PACE.

For example, if a postman is arrested at, say, a Mail Centre, the
Police can search his home without a warrant. Normaily, authority
from a Police Inspector or above would be required, but that can be
waived if it is thought necessary to conduct the search quickly. A
valid reason might be if you thought stolen property existed at the
home, which would be disposed of by someone else if the search was
delayed while the Inspector's authority was obtained.

Section 2:

POL00095325
POL00095325

‘The powers of the Police to search premises in which someone has
been arrested, or where they were located immediately before an
arrest, are set out in Section 32 of PACE.

For example, if a postman was arrested at his home by the Police,
and no search warrant had been obtained in advance, this Section
allows them to search the home without any additional authority
being obtained.

The above Sections of PACE are often used in Post Office cases
where an arrest has taken place and it is necessary to be fully aware
of your powers within these Sections. There is a more detailed
explanation of these Sections in the module on searching.

Although the Police can carry out searches in the circumstances
detailed above after an arrest the same powers do not apply to Post
Office Security Managers. Even if you have arrested someone, you
have no powers to carry out a search.

Full details of the forms to be used when carrying out searches with
consent are explained in the module on searching.

Searches must be carried out at a reasonable hour, unless this might
frustrate the purpose of the search.

‘

Searches must be conducted with due consideration for the property
and privacy of the occupier of the premises.

During this module there will be case studies with scenarios which
could exist in the ‘real’ world. If you had to deal with such a scenario
you would need to know where to look in the Codes of Practice to
receive guidance on how to react.

Read each scenario and look through Code B for the section which
deals with the particular problem you are faced with. Write down the
section number and a brief resume of how you would respond.

You have interviewed Pete Cousins regarding alleged theft from the
post. To date Pete has made no admissions. Pete has given you
written consent (on form CS005) to search his home address. Form
CS004 (Notice of Powers and Rights) has been served on him in
conjunction with the search. So far you have not found anything. You

you to leave my premises now”’. You are intrigued to find out what is
in the drawer. In accordance with the PACE Code of Practice what

Section 3:

Codes of Practice

POL00095325
POL00095325

This Code covers all aspects of the detention, treatment and
questioning of persons by Police, and therefore by Post Office
Security Managers. The Code is particularly important as it includes
interviews which are conducted on a voluntary basis, which is the
case with most Post Office interviews.

As stated earlier in this module, the Codes were designed for Police
Officers and that point is particularly relevant to Code C. Large parts
of the Code are concerned with the completion of custody records,
detention of people in custody, and other matters which are not
directly dealt with by Post Office Security Managers.

However, it can not be overemphasised that you must have a full
knowledge of the Code, even those Sections which do not directly
affect you.

‘This Code is by far the longest and covers 55 pages.

it is necessary to read ali 55 pages of this Code. However, it is
suggested that you do so in two or three separate sessions and return
to it later in the module.

The topics dealt with by Code C which are particularly important to
Post Office Security Managers are shown on the next page with their
Section numbers:

READING

POL00095325
POL00095325

This subject is fully covered in the separate module on cautions and
interviews, and therefore for the purpose of this module we have just
a brief overview of the contents of the Code.

All interviews with suspect offenders have to be tape recorded unless
limited exceptions prevail. Every Post Office Security Manager has
access to portable tape-recording equipment, and every Police Station
designated to deal with arrested people has specific interview rooms
with tape-recording equipment.

Please read Code E which is 12 pages long.

There are no additional case studies or questions on this Code, as it is
covered in full detail in the module specifically on that subject.
However, it is vital to relate the contents of Code E to the guidance
given about tape recording in the other module.

Practical exercises on interviewing suspect offenders take place on
the Investigation Practical Skills Course, and aspects of PACE will be

. incorporated into those exercises.

POL00095325

In this module we have covered some of the key areas of the PACE
Codes of Practice. The importance of this subject can not be over
estimated, and great care must be taken with the studying of the
module.

It is appreciated that the Codes of Practice booklet contains vast
amounts of information that can not be assimilated overnight. The
fact is, however, that as a Post Office Security Manager you are
expected to have a good, overall, working knowledge of the Codes.

If you are called on to give evidence in Court, it is quite reasonable
to expect Defence Barristers to question you on your knowledge of
PACK if it is thought you have failed to comply with parts of the
legislation.

‘You can therefore regard this subject as one of the most critical
during your training programme.

During your practical training, all the exercises are related to the
Codes of Practice to further your understanding of the subject.

In conclusion it must be said that if you breach PACE in situations
like the Case Studies, it is probable that any evidence gained in those
cases would be ruled inadmissible. PACE is all about the spirit of
fairness, and any failures to follow the Codes would normally be
dealt with in this way by a Judge.

CHECK RESULTS What powers do you have under this Section?

m

Section 18 authorises the Police to carry out a search of
premises occupied or controlled by someone, after they
have been arrested elsewhere. This usually means their
home address, and applies when they have been arrested
away from home. It normally needs the authority of an
Inspector or higher, but that can be waived if it is thought
neccessary to conduct the search quickly.

Post Office Security Managers have no powers under I
this Section,

Q3. What does Section 32 of PACE state about searches?
What powers do you have under this Section?

Section 32 gives the Police power to search the premises
where someone has been arrested, or where they were
located immediately before an arrest. This would normally
apply to someone arrested at home, No other authority is
needed.

Post Office Security Managers have no powers under this
Section.
