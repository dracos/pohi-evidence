Attachment: Re: Project Pineapple

Apologies the attachments were not included on the email I forwarded which Nick has sent earlier
this morning.

There are serious allegations about myself and others in the organisation (which, to say they are
disputed would be an understatement, but in the circumstances it not appropriate to have that
conversation though I find the timing of this interesting. It is disappointing for this document to have
to been shared with others such as Tracy Marshall etc.

Obviously, I am conflicted and cant provide any further advice but given the serious allegations I think
its appropriate that the CPO and the SID of Post Office is made aware (and also the Shareholder
representative) but I think its best to flag through Ben T.

Kind regards
Ben

I work flexibly — so whilst it suits me to email outside normal working hours, I do not expect a response
during that time.

Please can you produce a suitable response for Henry.

You will be aware of my views from discussions we have had....
I assume there are GFA restrictions too ?

For this afternoon please.

Nick ,

Could you please organise a response after our Board tomorrow ? At least one NED has said I should
meet them but I think that would be a mistake . We do need something to say to them in our reply
however . Many thanks .

Best,

Henry

Hello Henry,

This is the suggested email to send to Board (excluding Lorna and Nick), hopefully, I have
interpreted all of your emails correctly — happy to discuss in the morning. I have a doctors
appointment at 08.45hrs but should be back home by 09.15hrs.

Dear all

Ahead of our call on Thursday, please see attached a copy of the Voice of the Postmaster
Press Release for January, together with the letter addressed to myself.

In addition, please see attached a file note I prepared following my conversation with Saf and
Elliot on Sunday — WBE. They were

very supportive of Nick, but you will see that the VOP have made negative statements about
Nick .

Let's talk about this on Thursday and to note I have not yet responded to VoP regarding their
request for a meeting.

Regards,
Henry

PS Saf reminded me that I had omitted to mention the following :

¢ I have offered the investigations team time to get the tone right and advised them to
get more PM's involved but this seems to have been missed.

¢ The comms has been poor throughout our tenure within the business.

° The GE have overlooked advice given to them by board members on several
occasions without clear explanations.

Hi Henry
This echoes very much the comments that we discussed on Sunday - clearly we are
not losing the plot and real action is essential.
