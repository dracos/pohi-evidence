Nina, Ruth,

As discussed, we have engaged Susan Barty from CMS to look at the legal implications of the Second Sight Interim

Report (e.g. for potentially defamatory content).

Susan’s bio states that she “has extensive experience in the management and resolution of media and defamation
disputes. She regularly advises companies on how to use the law and the regulatory codes to protect their reputations

and on how to deal with adverse media attention, whether in broadcasts or in the press.”

Her contact details are:
