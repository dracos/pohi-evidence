Post Office Security

c.c. Dave Pardoe

ROYAL MAIL GROUP LIMITED v JOAN FRANCIS BAILEY
HOWEY SUB POST OFFICE
CASE NO: POLTD/1011/0164

Thank you for your E-Mail of the 10" May 2011. I apologise for the delay in
response as I had been out of the Office. I also refer you to my advice of the
3° May 2011.

In my opinion the evidence is sufficient to afford a realistic prospect of conviction
of the above named offender on a charge of fraud under the Fraud Act 2006.

Whilst not excusing Mrs Bailey but I agree that this case is such that a caution
would be appropriate. In reaching this decision I have taken into account the
following:

1 This appears to be an offence which occurred over a short period of
time.
2 From the outset Mrs Bailey has made full and frank admissions and also

the nature of the offence involved.

unfortunate {__

Mrs Bailey stated that she intends to repay the loss and indeed she is in the
process of selling her house and that is why I recommend that we obtain an
undertaking from her Conveyancing Solicitor that on the sale of the house from
the net proceeds the outstanding sum of £13,044.23 will be paid to Post Office
Limited.
