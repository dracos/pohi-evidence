Whe following is a copy of an email sent to Julie Welsh and Jez Murray, who will contact an appropriate person in POL so that

2 dec: an be made on the course of action to be taken

ion

FAD 147136 is a 5-counter site with 7 stock units. On 14/12/05 the M started the process of rolling over stock unit BB. He
sot as far as previewing the Trial Balance, made a few adjustments, then left it logged in until the following day.

n 15/12/05, he previewed the Trial Balance again but it contained only zero values. He rolled over the stock unit regardless,
nd later that day rolled the office into TP%. The Branch Trading Statement also shows zero values for stock unit BB and a non-
zero Trading Position.

‘Stock unit BB was rolled over in an effectively empty state. The PM then declared the correct amount of cash, and adjusted the
istock levels up to the correct volumes. This has resulted in a gain of approximately £18000.

Je are unable to

rrect the system figures safely. We can however provide accurate figures for what should have been in the
‘Final Balance for BB, to enable POL to make the correction perhaps by using a Transaction Correction.

POL need to make a decision on whether they are able to correct the problem in this way, however we do not see any other
alternative. Corrective action should be taken before llth January when the branch is due to roll into TP10.

ihe cause of the problem is unknown and is under investigation.

Raising call to an 'A' priority as we have now had at least three instances of the problem.

dcion,

If we get to the problem before the office is rolled we are able to change objects in the messagestore to reset the stockunit
back to the CAP (TP) rollover trailer. The PM can then rollover. PM should get a large shortage which cancels out the large
ain.

je don't want to be having to do this as making manual changes to the messagestore is open to error and each time we have to
eek authorisation from POL to make the changes.

If we get to the problem after the office is rolled (as in this call) then we are unable to correct the system figures safely.
[Its not been decided how we get the PM sorted out.

11 in all, we want this fixed asap.

I think there must have been a drop of that object that evening £#8211; there would have been an earlier one before that.

I do notice that for the cross referenced PEAK PC0130461 this object was dropped the evening of the problem as well; however

I went back to look at PC0128969. This had me very puzzled initially. I could not understand how you get Node Disconnection
messages on a single counter Office. However the explanation is that the office has a node 1 and a node 31 and so from the
boint of view of EPOSSWatchDog is not a single counter office. I suspect that node 31 is a mirror disk.

I set up a dual counter system with nodes 1 and 31 and imported the supplied message store to a date and time of <Date:09-Nov-
005><Time:13:09:20>, I added the AccountingPeriods persistent object since no subscription groups had been supplied.

I then went through the rollover process for stock unit AA but pulled out the network cable whilst previewing the trial
balance. After the preview had been dismissed a disconnection message appeared on the counter. After a few seconds I
reconnected the counter. I acknowledged the disconnection message and then the connection message that appeared underneath it
nd continued the balancing process. Nothing went wrong.

I repeated this experiment but deliberately tried double clicking the buttons that appeared after the network messages had been
acknowledged. I could still get nothing to go wrong.

lence I am starting to run out of ideas on this PEAK.
‘The common thread on all of them is that node disconnection and connection messages would have appeared on the balancing

creen and after that point you can see from the audit log that a tree build occurs (additional to the ones that occur in my
ttempt to duplicate the problem) and after that thin

I have almost certainly now found the mechanism for this problem; though one minor detail needs further work.

In EPOSSStockUnit clsStockUnit is a method ProcessReConnection which, since $80, is called when the clerk acknowledges the
reconnection message. This under certain circumstances rebuilds the tree. However in balancing the tree has been frozen and so
if it is rebuilt by this code (which does not unfreeze it) in these circumstances all data is stored in a different place
Mithin each object within the data tree than usual (dValueChangeWhileFrozen rather than dCurrentValue for example) so that when
che tree is accessed later zeros are returned.

11 the observed facts are fitted by this explanation; the problem only happens on node reconnection, there is always an extra
cree build which appears to be populated from the audit log and zeros are retrieved from the built tree. I have duplicated the
problem by forcing code down the rebuild path in these circumstances.

I am now trying to figure out how the test done on reconnection is fooled into thinking a tree build is required; it is not
when I rerun with imported messages stores.

I have only found one possibility for how this problem would come about and that is the bit of code

1:39 User:Gerald Barnes

"StockUnit attachment has not changed whilst disconnected
Tf objStockUnit.intCAP <> iLocalCAP Or _

bjStockUnit.intBP <> iLecalBP or
bjStockUnit.fbIsCurrentInTPMode <> bLocalSUInTPMode Then
"Locally out of sync with message store - refresh local state
eSaveStockUnitProperties objStockUnit

fRefreshCurrentFigures sStockUnit

fUpdateDesktopIdleltems objStockUnit, sCurrentUser

If objStockUnit.fbIsCurrentInTPMode <> blocalSUInTPMode Then
"TP mode has changed so refresh desktop buttons
RefreshButtons = True

ithin ProcessReConnection of EPOSSStockUnit is being executed within the balancing process. It is the case that the outer
st is hit in all 4 cases observed. However in fact the inner block (which would give rise to all the symptoms observed
448211; the extra tree build apparently populated but returning 0s) is not hit in my reruns.

I therefore propose a new release of EPOSSStockUnit with extra audit lines within the if test to print out all relevant
comparison variables to see whether this is genuinely the cause of the problem and to give some idea as to how the problem
ame about if it is.

‘he effect on performance of these trace lines would be negligible because they would only be output on network
disconnection/reconnection.

Tt would only take 1 man day to code and test this extra diagnostic.

force the diagnostic to appear in a correct sense. Have a dual counter office with a sotck unit IND attached to MIGROL. Log
in to counter 2 and then disconnect it and acknowledge the disconnection message. Log in to counter 1, roll stock unit IND
into the next TP ignoring all disconnection warnings and then log out of counter 1. Reconnect counter 2 and acknowledge the

land show that the reason for the fatal rebuild of the tree was that bLocalSUInTPMode was False which is clearly a bug because
now this office and all other offices are in TP mode.

LocalSUInTPMode is determined from the PropertyBag element called SUInTPMode which is set in login.

I tried to figure out how this property could be not set and did find a bug in the PropertyBag dll in that it is cleared on
ession swap when it should not be.

This bug could then be easily explained if the rollover was attempted in a swapped session «#8211; however I found that you
mormally cannot rollover a stock unit in a swapped session. I looked in the supplied message store and saw evidence of session
swapping. I believe that there is a bug in the Riposte DesktopIsSwapped call in that it sometimes says a session is not
wapped when it is.

ly proposed solution to this bug is to eliminate all references to the properties SUInTPMode and OfficeInTPMode which are only
used in EPOSSStockUnit. There are only 6 references in total and so the change is not a big one. These properties are now
redundant because all offices are in TP mode. There is a definite bug with both of them because they are not maintained on
ession swap when they should be.

T have managed to find one reproducible bug scenario. It is not the actual bug noted here but illustrates that a lurking bug
is present.

ave a dual counter office. Log on to one counter and declare cash. It takes a while because it is the first time. Look in the
audit log and you will see evidence of a tree rebuild. Declare cash again and see that it is much quicker and that in the
audit log there is no evidence of a tree rebuild. Now swap session. Disconnect the other counter, wait for the disconnection
essage, connect the counters and wait 11 seconds. Acknowledge both messages. Declare cash and see that it has slowed again.
‘Look in the audit log and the diagnostics as at the top will be there and there will be evidence of a tree rebuild s#8211;
chere should not have been a tree rebuild in these circumstances.
