1. Scoring Table

Below table sets out the Residual Risk Score and Rating that will apply upon review of the
Postmaster Accounting Dispute Resolution Policy, to determine how effective the policy is, any
control weaknesses or gaps and whether the policy needs enhancements/improvements.

CONFIDENTIAL
POL00448075
POL00448075

The framework of governance, risk management and control is adequate and effective.

Some improvements are required to enhance the adequacy and effectiveness of the
framework of governance, risk management and control.

There are significant weaknesses in the framework of governance, risk management and
control such that it could be or could become inadequate and ineffective.

There are fundamental weaknesses in the framework of governance, risk management
and control such that it is inadequate and ineffective or is likely to fail.

2. Overall Rating / Residual Risk Score of The Review

The overall rating and residual risk score applied to this review is:

There are fundamental weaknesses in the framework of
governance, risk management and control such that it is
inadequate and ineffective or is likely to fail

This is predominantly driven by:

¢ = The failure to track all appropriate metrics, as set out in the table at section 7

Discrepancies in the evidence provided which suggest that standards are not being applied
across the board. In particular, call monitoring logs are incomplete or missing.

@ The minimum controls described within the policy are also not adequately articulated as
controls.

@ The need to assess the E2E processes and their monitoring to ensure ‘dispute resolutions’
outcomes are appropriate and as per policy expectations.

What is working well:

¢ Investigations are undertaken quickly
¢ Postmasters are provided with information at each relevant stage

3. Objective of the review

To assess the validity of the policy within the universe of risk framework. To review the lead and lag
indicators of the policy and to sample check some of the key minimum control standards in the
Postmaster Accounting Dispute Resolution Policy. Finally, to assess whether the effectiveness of
the policy is being implemented across the group.

4. Background

The Postmaster Accounting Dispute Resolution Policy is sponsored by the Central Operations Director,
who has overall accountability to the Board of Directors for the design and presentation of controls
for managing accounting disputes with postmasters.

CONFIDENTIAL
POL00448075

POL00448075

The policy sits within a suite of postmaster support policies that have been established with the inten-
tion to set the minimum operating standards relating to the management of our postmaster contract
risks throughout the business. The suite of policies purport to be in-line with Post Office’s risk appetite,
which is primarily averse.

The Postmaster Accounting Dispute Resolution Policy was drafted, reviewed and approved by the
RCC & ARC in March 2022. This review forms part of the policy assurance review programme.

The Postmaster Accounting Dispute Resolution Policy has been established to capture the
minimum operational standards required relating to: (i) POL’s obligation to investigate accounting
disputes; and (ii) ensuring ongoing transparency between POL and postmasters.

5. Methodology

The assurance review will consist of the following:

- Is risk adequately identified?

- Is the risk appetite correctly identified?

- Are the key personnel correctly identified?

- Are reported minimum controls actually controls?

- What are the key controls?

- What are the key metrics?

- _ Is the process/procedure correctly articulated?

- Does the evidence show the policy is working?

- Given the above, can we be sure the policy is fit for purpose?

6. Source of Information

The review is based on examining the policy, assessing the control metrics against the desired
outcomes and reviewing supporting materials supplied by the Policy Owner.

The source of the information came from:

- Postmaster Accounting Dispute Resolution Policy
- Policy Owner-supplied evidence

Initial requests for evidence from the business to show compliance with the policy resulted in only a
single example for each control being produced. This was insufficient to reach any considered
findings and so access was sought to Dynamics, the system that houses case files and investigations.
Despite support being provided by the business area, access was not available at the time of drafting
the first iteration of this report. Preliminary findings were shared with the Policy Owner and a
workaround was found to access additional evidence. The findings in this report have been updated
to reflect the provision of the additional evidence. Gaps in the evidence still remain and these are
set out in the tables in section 7 below, along with the relevant explanation for their absence.

7. Findings

Issue Finding Rating

CONFIDENTIAL
Is the policy capturing the
correct risks?

The key elements of the inherent risk

have been identified.

Cause — By failing to carry out a timely,
fair and transparent investigation;

Event — there may be loss of postmaster
confidence in POL, financial losses and
legal challenges, as well as a lack of

accountability;

Impact — leading to damage to the POL
brand, financial loss and regulatory,
reputational and financial risks.

Is the risk appetite correctly
identified?

There is an adverse risk appetite in
connection with dispute resolution. The
process identified within the policy is
consistent with this appetite level.

Are the key personnel
correctly identified?

The policy is missing several key players
within the accountability framework.
Consider whether there should be
reference to the Group Investigation Unit,

Assurance, and GE.

Are reported minimum
controls actually controls?

Ten out of the 14 minimum controls that
are identified within the policy (identified
below by *) are actually process points
rather than controls. The policy should be

reworked to assess controls.

What are the key controls?

Key controls are not readily identifiable
within the policy as whilst the relevant
areas are identified, they have been
formulated as processes and procedures.

Are the KPIs adequately
identified and measured?

The examples of the weekly report
provided, indicate that most of the
appropriate KPIs are being tracked. There

is a clear record of how many

investigations are underway, how old
they are, how they are being monitored
and who by. It is not clear whether there
is a tracker in place identifying what’s
happening on each case, eg if it is written
off etc. In the absence of any clear
capturing of end-to-end process
monitoring, this is likely to result in

issues/problems being missed.

reduction in reported losses to

Upon review of the Postmaster Accounting Dispute Resolution Policy and the above-mentioned Minimum Control Standards which are stated within the
policy, it is evident that some of these areas and controls have been adhered to and are fit for purpose and work in pursuit of day-to-day business.
However, some gaps have been identified and it has not been possible to view the necessary evidence for some areas in order to be able to draw a
complete conclusion. As a result, the policy assurance has been recorded as ‘needs significant improvement’.

8.

Recommendations

Following the assurance review of the Postmaster Accounting Dispute Resolution Policy, the following recommendations are made:

The “minimum control standards” section of the policy is heavily focused on procedural steps rather than actual controls — the policy needs
updating to include key controls and metrics.

The policy is updated/amended to reflect the missing key personnel.

Reviewed call logs need to be monitored and all completed records should be uploaded. Training plans should be completed as needed and the
tracking log should match the records held in the logs.

Review policy processes and procedures with an EDI lens.

The policy is further reviewed after access to the main systems is obtained, so that additional evidence can be assessed. Evidence should be
provided within four weeks of receiving the preliminary findings and the further review completed within three months.
