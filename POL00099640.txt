Paula - as we agreed I have just told Ron Warmington that

ant are proposing to use Tony Hooper as the independent Chair of the working party he was positive about
that and

- that I am leaving POL. - I stressed that if he has any concerns that he should reach out to Angela and
also Paula I have volunteered that he should also feel free to contact you with any concerns. I
stressed how committed the team are to making the mediation work and also to re-engineering the sub
postmaster journey and how strongly you personally felt about this.

Paula - could I suggest that it might be a good idea if you could call him maybe next week to touch base
