Fair enough. We'll take it out.

But 32 is wrong in relation to TCs — for TC disputes the SPMs contact FSC not the helpline (as per the contact details
stated on the TC).

Sorry, one final point on this. Not sure we want to include Factual Matrix Point 32. We accept that this was true. So
even though it is being used illegitimately by the Judge (to determine the status of the BTS), I do not think it falls
within 23-24 of Parson 14, which is focused on findings which we say he has made too early, and in the absence of
full evidence and disclosure. Further evidence and disclosure will not make any difference to this point, because
we accept that it is true.

Amy,

On more thought re the factual matrix section: we should remove point 67. It is too close to the matrix we contend
for at Point 67 of the Factual Matrix document.

If Gideon thinks they’re problematic please leave them out. We’ve got a lot of good material and I don’t

want it undermined by taking points that don’t really work. What time tomorrow is this due to be served?
I’m in an arbitration hearing all day but I could look at any disputed bits over lunch (1pm to 2pm) if that

would help.

Thanks Andy. Agree with the approach. Nonetheless, I have highlighted a few of these which I think we
should not include - some of them seem a bit problematic to me. But subject to that, from my perspective
this is good to go.

All

As per my discussion earlier today with Gideon, we have added more sections of the Judgment to the
attached statement. Our approach has been to include anything that we might rely on, unless plainly not
relevant to the application. The objective being to avoid any challenge on appeal that a point in the Judgment
was not put to Fraser on the application.

All comments welcomed.
Kind regards
Andy
