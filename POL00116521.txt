Subject: Alan Bates Letter

Tony has just called. He emailed Alan to ask him not to send his letter further, at least until the WG has had a chance
to discuss. Alan has agreed to that but said he did send a copy of his letter to James Arbuthnot for information. I do
not know when that was. I assume that it was at the time he wrote to the Minister, although I could be wrong. I think
our stance still stands and I think that if JA were going to contact us, he would already have done so. However,
regardless of that I think the position we agreed on the call today, that is that the WG are going to discuss this on
Thursday still stands.

I need to leave now as I have to walk back to the station. But will pick up emails/be available to speak if anyone
wants to.

Best wishes
Belinda
