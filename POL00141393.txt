Re: Our Client Kim Elizabeth Wylie

Newcastle Magistrates Court ~ 7 August 2012 at 10 a.m. ~ For committal

As you know, we act on behalf of the above named.

Our client has brought to our attention that the Post Office Management have decided to allow
forensic accountants to examine Horizon. This decision appears to have been made after our
client appeared in the Magistrates Court for the first hearing.

In view of the decision that has now been made, as of course our client is maintaining she has not
stolen any money and that the fault is due to the Horizon system, what is your position with
regards to how this matter is now to proceed

Clearly, we would submit that if the Post Office are now looking at the possibility that there may
be an error in the Horizon system then this case should not proceed further at this time.

Perhaps you could advise us as to what stance is to be taken to enable us to consider matters
further with regards to possible abuse of process etc arguments that may be advanced on behalf
of our client.

We look forward to hearing from you.

Yours faithfully
