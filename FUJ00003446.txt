Unique transaction number to be used in all messages between HNG-X and the Fis
relating to the transaction. Generated by HNG-X and provided in the request
message initiating the transaction.

‘New’ Transactions

Transactions that have had a change of state since they were last reported, or have
never been reported except in NB102 section 6. Note that if a transaction appears in
NB102 section 6 it is future dated as is reported in that section for information only.
Once future dated transactions become current dated, they must be reported as
though they have not appeared on the reports before.

‘Old’ Transactions

Transactions that have NOT had a change of state since they were last reported.

POLSAP Transactions

POLSAP was retired in 2019 and POLSAP transactions do not exist

Receipt Date is the Date as printed on the transaction Receipt at the Counter. It
forms part of all transactions.

Receipt Time

Receipt Time is the Time as printed on the transaction Receipt at the Counter. It
forms part of all transactions.

Reconciliation Date

The Reconciliation Date is the date attributed to a transaction to allow Post Office
Ltd. to reconcile. It will be set the first available Bank Settlement date from the
transaction elements (C12, C4, S & D) that make up a Network Banking
transaction. If no Bank Settlement date is available, the Reconciliation Date will be
set to the processing date that the Data Reconciliation Service first recorded any
element of the transaction being received. If a Settlement date subsequently
becomes available, the first available Bank Settlement date will replace the
processing date. However, once a transaction has been accounted for on the
reconciliation reports, the Reconciliation Date will never change.

Routing Gateway

Identifies a system, where the authorisation for a specific transaction should be
sought.

Run Date

This is the System Processing Date for which the report refers, i.e. all transaction
components processed by the DRS on System Processing Date dd/mm/yyyy are
accounted for on this report.

Settlement Date

Settlement Date is often the same as Run Date but some Financial Institutions may
assign a Settlement Date in the future: e.g. the following Monday may be set on
transactions processed on the preceding Friday, Saturday and Sunday.

FUJITSU End to End Reconciliation Reporting

FUJITSU RESTRICTED (COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE)

1. Introduction

This document has been compiled to specify Fujitsu Services outputs from the Data Reconciliation
Service (DRS) and the Automated Payment Service (APS) so as to enable a generic end to end
reconciliation of

1. Banking and Related Services transactions, which includes DCS and ETS
2. Automated Payment System (APS)

2 Scope

This document defines the format and content of all reconciliation reports for HNG-X, which satisfies the
DRS and APS reconciliation requirement. It does not attempt to define within the operating systems how
the transactions are processed.

This document does not attempt to define the business processes undertaken within Fujitsu Services and
Post Office Ltd. with respect to the resolution of any exceptions which may arise, nor does it scope the

requirement for any systems that may be required to assist in this process. This information can be
found in the associated documents, reference:-

e SVM/SDM/PRO/0012: Reconciliation and Incident Management - Joint Working Document

3 Network Banking Reconciliation Reports
Specified

For Network banking services each of the Post Office Ltd. Clients, as dictated by Routing Gateway, will
require a separate reconciliation report set.

Within this report set, separate reports will be provided as per the following table:-

Report Deposit Withdrawal
Number Transactions Transactions
NB101 Combined Report

NB102 Combined Report

NBOOO is a combined report for all Routing Gateways.

The format and content of each Client's report is considered to be identical when allowing for these
specific requirements. It should therefore be understood that the specifications documented here are
applicable to each Client report set (specific Client requirements outside of this reporting specification
are not covered within this document).

There must be a separate set of reports to provide for transactions for which the Routing Gateway and/or
Transaction Type is not known.

Non-Financial transactions such as Balance Enquiries and PIN changes are explicitly excluded from the
report set as ‘Not Required by Post Office Ltd.’

No report will mix currency, so if ever the transactions selected to appear on a set of reports are not of a
single currency, then a separate set of reports will be produced for each currency. All the amounts in a
single transaction will always use the same currency

e NB102: Exception Summary

Rows and columns are described in detail, together with the mathematical calculations required to
achieve reconciliation.

All general aspects relating to the production and transmission of the reports are described.

NB: It should be noted that where a system ‘State’ definition is quoted, this takes precedence over any
narrative which has only been provided to help understand the business processes.

3.1 General Banking and Related Services Report
Specifications

A separate set of reports is produced for each Post Office Ltd. Client as identified by the Routing
Gateway (For example: Santander and POCa being single Clients and Vocalink being split into 2
separate clients). The specification is general to all reports sets.

1. For volumes and values the accounting sense for reporting purposes to allow settlement
totals to be correctly derived, will be:

Absolute volume

Net value

Where no value reported show “0.00”

Where no volume reported show 0

-ve values will be shown in parenthesis e.g. (nnn.nn)

2. Each report will show the following general information:

Report title — including the Client name (derived from Routing Gateway.)
Transaction Type — (if applicable)

Report ‘Run Date’ - i.e., the period for which the report refers

Production date and time

Fujitsu Services report number

Fujitsu Services reference

3. Where ‘Received’ and ‘Reconciliation Date’ are quoted against time parameters:

e ‘Received = New’: defines transactions that have had a change of state since they were
last reported, or have never been reported, except in NB102 section 6

e ‘Received = Old’: defines transactions that have NOT had a change of state since they
were last reported

4. Reports: NBOOO, NB101 and NB102 will be produced DAILY. They will be delivered by
08.00hrs the day following the Run Date to:

e Post Office Ltd. Delivered by PODG to POLDG.

e Fujitsu Services CS, DRS Workstation. A copy of all the reconciliation files is gathered
onto the SSC server and extracted via the RDT version of PODG to be delivered
automatically to the Security Operations group mailbox

5. Within report NB 102 the ‘Exceptions’ category will include:
e ‘Incomplete States’, i.e. those transactions where one or more transaction component is
missing — a C4 without a C12 etc.
e Genuine exceptions where transaction components belonging to the same high level
transaction have been exceptioned, e.g. C12 (amount) not = to C4 (amount).

6. For clarity within this document, field sizes are shown within ‘Report Layout’ and not within
the ‘Data Definition’

7. All reports are run against a consistent data set.

8. All reports will be produced as ASCII text files - one for each report. The report layout will be
fixed format with space characters providing the blank space. This will allow for ‘Excel’ input,
using fixed field width facilities. The formatting (lines and shading referred to in this
document) will not be included within the file. Every line will have the character ‘newline’,
Hex '0A', as the last character. Each report will have the text “End of Report” as the last line.

9. See also comments in Section 2: ‘Scope’

3.2. NB000: Summary Report

This report summarises all reconciliation reports produced by the DRS. It also summarises all reports
that were not produced by the DRS because there was no data to report.

3.2.1 NBO000: Rules
1. Reports are listed by application type, Routing Gateway, and report number.
2. Where a report is produced, the filename will be shown.

3. Where for a routing gateway, there is some data to report, but for a specific report there is no data,
then the filename will be replaced by [NO DATA].

Where for a routing gateway there is no data at all, the application type cannot be shown and the file
name will be replaced by [NIL RETURN].

3.2.2 NB101: Network Banking Settlement Statement

This report identifies ‘C4’ transactions received against each ‘C4 Settlement Date’ as reported to
the DRS for the most recent processing date. The report will be used by Post Office Ltd. as a
basis for settlement of Network Banking transactions with the Financial Institutions (Fis).

3.2.3 NB101: Rules

NB101 is run daily

NB101 is repeated for each Routing Gateway

NB101 will show ‘C4’ transactions received for ONE day only — breaking these down into

individual ‘C4 Settlement Dates’ There will be one line for each ‘C4 Settlement Date’

4. NB101 will show Deposit and Withdrawal transactions in separate columns, (headed
‘Receipts’ and ‘Payments’ respectively) derived from ‘Txn_Type’

5. NB101 will show a final settlement column derived in the following way:

e« Volume: Volume of Deposits plus Volume of Withdrawals

e Value: Value of Deposits minus Value of Withdrawals

e Where the net total is negative i.e. the Value of Withdrawals exceeds the Value of
Deposits, the total will be shown as (xxx.xx)

ena

6. Where the volume for a given ‘C4 Settlement Date’ is nil, the date will not be reported.

7. ‘C4 Settlement Dates’ are shown in reverse chronological order.

8. Where there is more than one institution with the same Routing Gateway, the values for the
institutions will be shown individually provided the transaction volume for that institution is
greater than zero.

Liability issues are not covered within this document, nor are the business processes
involved in the resolution of any exception.

3.3.1. NB102: POLSAP Definition

The DRS Reports refer to the POLSAP system that has now been decommissioned. The
POLSAP system used to receive its transaction feed from the legacy TPS system and it was the
feed of C112 messages from TPS that gave assurance that there was reconciliation with
POLSAP.

Neither POLSAP or the C112 messages remain.

3.3.2 NB102: Rules

NB102 is run daily
NB102 is repeated for each Routing Gateway.
For each report section, the column ‘Values’ will be partitioned into 8 sub columns to contain
the values for: ‘C12’, ‘S’, ‘C4’, ‘C112’ & the four values from a ‘D’ which are: Amount
Requested, Amount Authorised, Amount Confirmed, Amount Discrepancy. The reports will
populate all values that are available. Since the C112 message no longer exists, the C112
columns will always be blank.
4. For reporting purposes, within NB102 sections 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10 & 11, the column headed
‘CAP’ will be blank.
5. For reporting purposes within NB102 sections 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, the column headed
‘Discrepancy Type’ will report the ‘D’ discrepancy type.
Where no ‘D’ transaction element has been received, the ‘Discrepancy Type’ will be blank

ens

6. Where an exception is set to F99 by Fujitsu Services , clearance of this exception within the
appropriate NB102 section, (e.g. section 2 exceptions shown as cleared within section 8),
will always refer to the previously reported state regardless of any change of state which
may have occurred within the DRS.

7. All Uncleared Confirmed & Unconfirmed exceptions are reported as summary totals by

exception type - (NB102 section 1)

9. Uncleared Transaction corruptions exceptions are listed individually - (NB102 section 3)

10. Uncleared Timing Differences are listed individually — (NB102 section 4)

11. Uncleared Confirmed & Unconfirmed exceptions >24 hours are listed individually - (NB102
section 5)

12. Uncleared Future Dated Transactions are reported as summary totals by Client identified by
Routing Gateway — (NB102 Section 6)

13. All Cleared Confirmed & Unconfirmed exceptions are reported as summary totals by
exception type - (NB102 section 7)

14. Cleared Exceptioned Client Transactions are listed individually —- (NB102 section 8)

15. Cleared Transaction corruptions are listed individually — (NB102 section 9)

16. Cleared Timing differences are listed individually — (NB102 section 10)

17. Cleared Confirmed & Unconfirmed exceptions >24 hours are listed individually — (NB102
section 11)

18. Cleared Future Dated Transactions are reported as summary totals by Client identified by
Routing Gateway — (NB102 Section 12)

19. Within each section, exception summary totals / individual transactions are to be grouped
and sub totalled by reconciliation date with a total provided for the entire section.

20. For reporting purposes:

« Timing Differences: relate to differences in the reconciliation date / settlement date
allocated where a settlement date on a transaction element is not the same as the
reconciliation date first reported on that transaction.

¢ Future Dated Transactions: relate to those transactions that have a Reconciliation Date
ahead of the Run Date of the report. For example, most Clients will settle Friday,
Saturday and Sunday transactions on the following Monday. This means that each
transaction completed on these days will have a Reconciliation Date ahead of the Run
Date of the report. These transactions are expected to clear naturally once the
Reconciliation Date and the Run Date are in sync, however in the rare eventuality that a
Reconciliation Date is considerably ahead of the Run Date, Post Office Ltd. may wish to
clear the exception manually. In this case, Fujitsu Services will set the transaction to
‘F99".

21. For reporting purposes, within NB102 sections 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10 and 11 the column headed
‘Transaction Type’ will be populated by the Txn Type codes as defined in Appendix A
Transaction Types

22. For Banking and Related Services reconciliation reporting, System States 8, 9, 10, 11, 16,
17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, E05, E06, E07, E14, E22, E24, E31, E32, E33, E38 are never
expected within report NB102 because ‘S’ transactions are not used in NB.

tem States

The removal of TPS from the Legacy landscape also removed the need for the C112 message to be
reconciled with DRS. The removal of the C112 removed intermediate states '2', '13', '18' and '22' and
made states ‘5’, ‘6’, ‘7’, ‘9’, ‘11’, ‘14’, ‘17’, ‘21’ and ‘23’ unattainable since these all required the presence
of aC112. These latter states are show in grey in the following table. In addition, various error states
have become ‘Not used’ since these are related to values in C112 messages not equating to values in
other message parts.

4 APS Reconciliation

On-line Counter, SSK and HiH Automated Payment transactions are committed to the Branch Database
during the customer session settlement process at the same time that the Auditable Journal records are
written. The Journal Records contain a dense set of Journal Sequence Numbers that prove no
transaction is missing or duplicated.

Offline/External Automated Payment transactions (such as Paystation transactions) are delivered in
file(s) via PODG on a daily basis. These files contain a sub-file for each Branch that contain value and
volume totals that ensure the integrity of the data contained therein. These are validated during the
transaction posting process to ensure no data loss or duplication.

The AP transactions from all data-sources are copied to a dedicated APS data store where they are held
pending their delivery to the AP Client via AP Client Files.

Note 1: AP Transactions that are mapped to Client Account No “9999” do not get delivered to
any Client.

Note 2: AP transaction performed on certain devices (Such as Payzone) do not get delivered to
any Client.

At the end of each Trading Day, all transactions for the day are validated and any transactions failing
validation will be moved to a Quarantine area. Validation failures include the following scenarios:

Invalid Negative Value

Negative values are only allowed for reversal records or if the Delivery Agreement
indicates that the transaction is an Out-payment transaction.

Unmatched Reversal

This is a reversal record where the corresponding original transaction is not present on
the current Trading Day. This may occur in certain counter recovery scenarios.

Missing Delivery Agreement

Delivery Agreement reference data controls the creation of AP Client Files. If the data is
missing for any client then the transactions cannot be delivered and will be quarantined.

Duplicate Transaction
Duplicate transactions are not expected and can only occur in the case of system bugs.

Quarantined transactions can be viewed and processed using a Graphical User Interface available to
Fujitsu’s third-line support team. Where transactions were quarantined due to missing or invalid
reference data then the transactions can be moved back into the main processing stream once that
reference data has been corrected. These transactions will then be delivered to the AP Client. In the
case of an unmatched reversal, since the original transaction will almost certainly have been sent to the
AP Client then a manual activity must be in place to inform the AP Client that the payment has been
reversed. The transaction will then be archived as “manually processed”

Note 1: The BRDB Transacted value will not include transactions for Client Account = “9999” or those
transactions where the Device Type signifies that the transactions are not to be delivered.

Note 2: The Value delivered in Client Files is summed-up during the client file creation as each record is
written to the file. The total for each file is recorded in the file audit trail. Some client files
include the reversals and reversed transactions and some do not. Either way, these transactions
balance-out in the calculated totals. This is not the case for File-type “BT” that includes the
reversed transaction only and these have to be taken into account during the calculation of the
Client Files value.

The discrepancy columns should always be zero and an automated alert will be raised if ever this is not
the case. The alert will cause an incident to be raised for investigation.

In addition to reporting transaction values, the Branch Database also records transaction counts and
raises an alert if the transaction counts do not tally. The counts can be reported using HORIce.

When adding up transaction counts, the transacted reversals are added as positive values. However, in
many cases, reversals and their reversed counterparts are not delivered to the AP Client. This is a
recognised scenario during the production of a Client File and Reversed/Reversing transactions that are
withheld from the Client Files are updated to status “Reversed (Not delivered)”. During the reconciliation
of transaction counts, these transactions are counted as being dealt with appropriately (ie: seen,
understood and marked as processed).

4.3 APS Report Delivery

Reports for Post Office Ltd are delivered in accordance with security and audit requirements.
Both APS Reports are delivered to Fujitsu Services MAC Team and Post Office Ltd via e-mail.

4.4 External Transactions

Transactions that are performed on non-Horizon terminals are delivered to AP Clients via the Branch
Database and the APS Service. These transactions are loaded into the Branch Database and are
validated at this point to ensure that subsidiary Horizon systems can complete all necessary
processing. Transactions that fail validation are prevented from being loaded and are automatically
returned to the transaction supplier.

Due to this validation, there should be no further transaction processing failures within the Horizon
service.

However, there is a possibility that an external transaction is queried by an AP Client. This may occur
if the customer who performed an AP transaction queries or disputes the amount of the transaction. In
these instances, Fujitsu would receive the initial query but can only trace the transaction back to the
file in which the transaction was supplied. It is almost inevitable that this type of query will need to be
routed back to the transaction supplier for resolution.

This re-routing will be performed by raising a call with the Post Office Limited Service Desk.

A report is supplied to Post Office Limited called the Rejected Sub-Files Report. Report Description:-
Ordering of the report is Load Date followed by Trading Date.

The Times Rejected column will indicate how many times that the sub-file has been rejected and will
indicate whether there is an ongoing problem with poor quality data in corrected files.

If the quality of the data in the external transaction file is good then we would not expect any output
from the report.
