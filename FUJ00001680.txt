Introduction

A key requirement in the Pathway solution is that of business continuity i.e. ensuring
there are operational processes and procedures in place to ensure that any component
failure has minimal effect on the service provided.

This will cover failures in the core Fujitsu Services (Pathway) services e.g. NBS,
TPS, APS etc, support services and client services where appropriate.

A principle requirement specified within Requirement 830 of schedule A15, is the
provision of contingency plans which conform to an overall ‘Service Continuity
Framework’.

It is the objective of this document and associated contingency plans to satisfy that
requirement and Fujitsu Services (Pathway) and Post Office Limited have agreed that
the title of this document should be ‘Business Continuity Framework’.

Specifically this document will cover the following areas.

a) Provide a baseline definition of the Business Continuity Framework and
contingency plans as specified in Requirement 830.

b) Provide a detailed definition of Fujitsu Services (Pathway) deliverables associated
with business continuity and the methods of review and assurance.

c) Define the contents and format of the contingency plans.
d) Define the overall test strategy adopted for testing of the contingency plans.

e) Define the management processes for the management of Major Business
Continuity Incidents.

Scope

The scope of this document is targeted towards the Acceptance Review process
associated with Requirement 830. It also includes acceptance of other contingency-
related requirements as specified at 2.1. The method of acceptance will be specified as
appropriate.

The general framework defined in this document is release-independent.

This document does not include any details in respect of the technical testing of the
recovery processes, however REF22 does.

Related Requirements

For completeness, the following list identifies the other requirements related to
Business Continuity for:

Core System Release: 699, 803, 816, 820, 828, 831, 834, 891, 894, 911, 913, and 914
Network Banking Release: NBR276, NBR472 and NBRS13 as defined in REF 49.

3.0 Definitions

Business Continuity Framework is this document, which has been generated to
satisfy the requirement for a Service Continuity Framework.

Ata working level, Post Office Limited and Fujitsu Services (Pathway) generally
recognise the term Business Continuity as having three closely related components:

Resilience may be defined as the steps taken to avert a loss of service or disaster or
reduce the likelihood of a disaster or loss of service.

Contingency may be defined as the interim processes and procedures adopted during
the loss of service.

Recovery may be defined as the business and technical arrangements to restore a lost
system or service and manage the process of reversion to normal processing and full
resumption of service.

4.0 Framework Overview

4.1 Introduction

The Business Continuity Framework defines the methodology agreed between Fujitsu
Services (Pathway) and Post Office Limited for handling all aspects of Business
Continuity. This section defines the elements of the Business Continuity Framework
for the Horizon (CSR) and Network Banking releases.

The constituent elements of the Business Continuity Framework may be represented
as follows. Each element will be looked at in more detail below.

COMMERCIAL-IN-CONFIDENCE Date: 08-Oct-2002

4.1.1 Contingency Plans

Although Requirement 830 defines the provision of a Contingency Plan, in practice
there are a number of contingency plans. There is a plan for each major service
element. The contents of the contingency plans are specified within Requirement 830.
All plans must be of the document type Contingency Plan and shall contain
Continuity Plan within the title. Each plan shall have a specified owner. (Further
details in section 9)

Whilst a number of Fujitsu Services (Pathway) business continuity plans already
exist, having been created for the CSR release, this document has been written to
define the contents of Business Continuity plans and therefore generally uses future
phraseology.

Major elements of the plan follow.

4.1.1.1 Service Definition

The BCF shall be defined in terms of services rather than components of
infrastructure. The definitions of the services that are a subject of the BCF are defined
in this document. This is looked at in more detail in section 5.

4.1.1.2 Risk Analysis And Service Impact

Each contingency plan will identify all potential risks in terms of likelihood and
service impact.

Once an incident occurs which has a service continuity impact, there must be a
mechanism in place to assess the impact of the incident and the possible effect(s) it
will have on the end to end service. This is fairly complex and will be dependant upon
time of day and therefore will be a real-time process i.e. the impact of the service
failure at 2am will be different from the impact at 83pm. However, a high-level impact
statement will be included in the relevant contingency plan.

4.1.1.3 Escalation Contacts
Each contingency plan will contain escalation routes in conformance to Cross-
Domain Business Continuity management processes.

4.1.1.4 Resilience Strategy documents
Each contingency plan will contain, where appropriate, references to the underlying
resilience strategy document and/or technical design documents.

4.1.1.5 Contingency Procedures
Each contingency plan will contain a section defining contingency actions

From an operational perspective contingency actions are documented in a number of
places, depending upon the severity of the service element failure.

1, Within operational procedures, subordinate to REF19. Where appropriate the
contingency plan will make reference to the relevant operations manual.

Version: 6.0

COMMERCIAL-IN-CONFIDENCE Date: 08-Oct-2002

2, Where appropriate, contingency actions are documented within the Action column
of the Risk Analysis (and service impact) section of each plan.

3, Where appropriate, for potential MBCIs and MBCI contingency actions are
documented in the contingency section of each plan.

4.1.2 Service Framework

Section 5 contains details of the service elements and components together with their
relationship to each of the contingency plans.

4.1.3 Business Continuity Management Process

The resolution of incidents will be dealt with through the standard Help Desk Incident
Management process.

In the event of a Major Business Continuity Incident there will be a need for
controlled and co-ordinated activity across Pathway and Post Office Limited. (See
section 6)

4.1.4 Test strategy and plans

The test schedule and method will be defined as a separate document (REF 5) and
will be referred to within the contingency plans. The overall high-level strategy will
be defined in this document for agreement. (See section 7)

4.1.5 Review strategy

A review strategy defines the joint review mechanism prior to acceptance and also the
review mechanism of the processes following acceptance. This is defined in a later
section for agreement. (See section 8)

4.1.6 Deliverables and Acceptance Methods

Section 10 defines the deliverables required to satisfy the Business Continuity
requirements of Fujitsu Services (Pathway).

Also included in that section is the method of acceptance planned for each
deliverable

Introduction

Although Requirement 830 makes reference to a single contingency plan, this is
impractical in terms of contingency planning as the impact and effects of any failure
will vary for each service.

Having identified the requirement for a number of contingency plans there is an
option of making each plan based upon major system components, for example
produce a contingency plan for host hardware failure.

The disadvantage in this methodology is that in the case of a major host hardware
failure, although there may be a generic recovery process to recover the databases,
there will be totally different contingency actions in terms of service impact and
escalation for each of the services on the host e.g. the business impact on APS. It is
for this reason that the chosen framework is principally service based. The end-to-end
solution is split into a number of constituent services as defined in the following
section. These services are split into areas:

a) Pathway Core Services. These are services directly within the Pathway contractual
boundary and for which Pathway have full responsibility for operations and
maintenance. These services are directly involved in the receipt, processing and
delivery of business data

b) Pathway Support and Supplier Services. These are services that provide support
functionality but are not involved in business data traffic as above. Examples of these
services would include the Horizon Systems Helpdesk and Energis.

c) Client Services. These are services that are beyond the Pathway contractual
boundary but are part of the end-to-end business data traffic flow.

Additionally there are Service Components. These represent a part of the system
infrastructure and can be an individual component such as a Correspondence Server,
or a major component such as a Pathway Campus.

Service Breakdown

For the purposes of Business Continuity planning the contingency plans will be
produced for the end to end service. From an operational perspective it is
impracticable for these plans to cover every element or component in the end-to-end
service, ¢.g. an unserviceable power lead in a single counter outlet, however major
components will be documented.

The core service elements and support services are show in Figure 5.2 below.

6.0 Business Continuity Management Process

An incident is an unplanned occurrence that adversely impacts upon the normal
service in some important way. The scale of the event can range from a minor fault to
a major outage e.g.:

Minor incident e.g. Horizon terminal failure affecting service at an individual outlet.
Major incident e.g. outage of key back-end system affecting service at 17,500 outlets.

The resolution of minor incidents will be dealt with through the standard Help Desk
Incident Management process.

Major Business Continuity Incidents will have a significant impact upon Post Office
Limited. In such cases there will be a need for controlled and co-ordinated activity
across supplier organisations and Post Office Limited. Consequently all Major
Business Continuity Incidents will be managed via the ‘Fujitsu Services (Pathway)
Customer Service Business Continuity Management’ process (REF 18) and the Post
Office Limited and Fujitsu Services Business Continuity Interface Agreement (REF
45). These documents support the immediate escalation of major incidents to a Cross
Domain Business Continuity Management Team (BCMT). The BCMT consists of
operational managers from each organisation.

7.0 Test Strategy and Plans

7.1 Requirement
Requirement 830 states the requirement as follows
“ The contingency plans shall include a testing strategy with two distinct parts
a) Initial testing before commencement of RollOut of Services
b) Regular testing’

The testing requirements for Network Banking are specifically stipulated in Codified
Agreement Schedule N09 and are detailed in sections 7.2.2 and 7.3 below.

7.2. Initial Testing

7.2.1 Core System Release

Initial technical testing of technical processes, e.g. database recovery, was conducted
as part of the technical testing specified in REF 21 which was covered in Pathways
Technical and Security Test Programme and a joint report showing the results of this
testing was issued. (see REF 22).

Prior to CSR National Rollout the applicable contingency plans were operationally
tested, using the test plans defined in REFS, to validate the integrity of those plans.
The results of this testing is reported in REF 47.

7.2.2 Network Banking

Before Network Banking Live Pilot, Fujitsu Services (Pathway) shall carry out initial
testing of NBS business continuity plans and facilities through procedural
walkthroughs which shall (subject to any agreement to the contrary between the
parties) include initial testing of technical processes and the production of test reports.

Before Network Banking Go-Live (Network Banking operating in all outlets) Fujitsu
Services (Pathway) shall carry out live operational test(s) of the business continuity
plan for the following elements of the NBS:

1, Bootle Data Centre failure

2, Host Central Server failure

3, LNS, ISDN Router failure

4, An NBS Authorisation Agent failure
5, Failure of the NBS/NBE Interface.

These tests are to be incorporated in REFS.

COMMERCIAL-IN-CONFIDENCE Date: 08-Oct-2002

7.2.3, New Services

Where services are introduced as part of a new release the Test Plan (REFS) will be
revised to include the Business Continuity testing of those services and define when
the initial testing will be conducted.

The level and schedule of testing is dependent upon operational constraints and is
accomplished by a mix of operational tests and procedural walk-through. Where
involvement is required from Post Office Limited the test schedule will be agreed in
advance.

In addition customer-initiated test activity may be included, with Pathway agreement,
within the Business Continuity Test Plan (REFS).

7.3 Ongoing testing
For ongoing testing, an overall test strategy will be produced defining for each
service:
a) name of service
b) ownership of testing plan
c) type of testing i.e. procedural walk-through or operational test
d) frequency of testing and scheduled dates
e) test objectives, conditions, script and expected results
f) other units taking part
g) criteria for success and failure
h) test reports and follow-up
On-going business continuity tests will be conducted, after Network Banking Go-
Live, in accordance with the test methodology and frequency agreed in NO9 and
defined in table 2. These tests may be cancelled or rescheduled and/or the method
used for a test may be varied for operational business reasons by agreement in writing
between Post Office Limited and Fujitsu Services (Pathway) Business Continuity
Managers. Such agreement is not to be unreasonably withheld.

8.0 Review Strategy

A Business Continuity Steering Group has been established between Post Office
Limited and Fujitsu Services (Pathway). This group reviews the progress of each
release against the Fujitsu Services (Pathway) delivery and acceptance plans. It also
facilitates the co-ordination of joint development review and assurance activities
where necessary. This forum also provides an objective feed into the release
authorisation process for new releases.

This team, or subset of the team, reviews all aspects of business continuity on an
ongoing basis, during Live Trials and beyond. The remit of the team is to continually
look at ways of improving cross-domain business continuity processes.

9.0 Contingency Plans

9.1

9.2

9.3

Throughout section 9, the use of /talics denotes the actual words in requirement 830
of the contract.

The contingency plans shall be based on impact and risk assessments and agreed
between the CONTRACTOR and AUTHORITIES by a date consistent with the
Project Plan.

Ownership of Plans
‘Ownership of all contingency actions shall be identified in the contingency plans’

Each contingency Plan will clearly state the owner of the plan who is responsible for
the definition, maintenance, testing and review of the plan.

In addition to this, the Fujitsu Services (Pathway) Business Continuity Manager will
have overall responsibility for the development, co-ordination and integration where
appropriate of all Contingency Plans and providing Post Office Limited with a single
point of contact.

Plan Activation

‘The contingency plans shall include activation procedures and time periods within
which the contingency measures shall be activated’

Where appropriate Contingency Plans will contain a risk and impact assessment for
both the core post office day (08:00 to 20:00) and the non-core post office day (20:00
to 08:00). (See 9.3). For services where the impact of the service element failure is
common throughout the day, a single risk and impact assessment will be documented.

The risk assessment identifies the critical time periods for activation of contingency
measures and identifies the associated contingency actions.

Impact and Risk Assessment
‘The contingency plans shall be based on impact and risk assessments’

Contained within each service are a number of critical components, the failure of
which would cause a potential service disruption. Consideration shall also be given to
the impact arising from the loss of building or staff. Each of these critical
components and the associated failure scenarios will be identified and documented
within a risk and impact matrix within the Contingency Plan. This matrix is used as a
tool to present in a tabular form all risks identified with a service together with the
impact of that risk occurring, the time after which that impact becomes critical, and
the contingency actions to be taken.

Associated with each of the above elements are impact statements, which will define
the likely business impacts of failure of the critical components. To aid in the
definition of these, each Contingency Plan, where appropriate, will contain a
schematic defining the operational day for that particular service. SLA liabilities will

be used as an aid in determining business impact. Where the impact triggers either a
Potential MBCI or an MBCI, the appropriate action will be identified from within the
matrix.

Associated with the impact statement will be a reference to the specific recovery and
contingency procedures required.

Business impact assessment will be reviewed jointly with Post Office Limited and
will be subject to ongoing review.

The combination of risk and impact will also determine the level of ongoing testing
that will form part of the testing strategy.

9.4 Other Requirements
‘The contingency plan shall include, without limitation, the following
a) Prevention measures
b) Preparedness measures
c) Contingency measures
d) Recovery of normal service
e) Contacts list’
In addition to the above the plans shall include details of the individual services,
references to the relevant operations manual and references to the underlying
resilience strategy document and/or technical design documents, where appropriate.
9.4.1 Preventative Measures
Preventative measures are defined as those measures that are in place to prevent
service continuity failures in the first place. There are two aspects that are considered.
9.4.1.1 Technical Design

A key element of the design of the service is the elimination of single points of failure
and the ability to Fail-over to a replicated operational facility and/or environment and
to recover the service in a timely manner.

This capability is documented in a number of technical design documents, which in
turn are referenced within the relevant Contingency Plans.
9.4.1.2 Security

Another preventative measure is the denial of access to the service to anyone who
may wish to deliberately cause disruption. Although not mentioned specifically within
Contingency Plans, this requirement is met through general conformance to Access
Control Policy (REF25) and the Security Functional Specification (REF23).

9.4.2 Preparedness Measures

Preparedness measures are implemented in a number of ways:

Version: 6.0

COMMERCIAL-IN-CONFIDENCE Date: 08-Oct-2002

9.4.3

9.4.4

9.4.5

a) The provision of risk and impact assessments, along with references to
appropriate recovery and contingency procedures will allow appropriate
actions to be carried out in a pre-prepared manner.

b) Initial technical testing and the operational testing of Contingency Plans
will ensure all activation of the Plans will have been carefully rehearsed.

c) Joint process and procedure walk-through will, as above, ensure all Cross-
Domain (multi-party) Business Continuity processes are tested thoroughly.

Contingency Measures

Contingency measures may be defined as the actions to be performed in the event of a
service break to enable business impact to be minimised during the service outage
prior to recovery being completed.

Contingency measures will include the recognition, activation, incident management
and initiation of recovery procedures. These will be documented within the
contingency plan and also as references to supporting documentation.

An example of contingency measures is failing over the host server in the event of the
prime server experiencing a failure.

Recovery of Normal Service

These procedures will be mainly of a technical operational nature and will mainly
refer to technical procedures defined within the Fujitsu Services (Core Services)
Operational Procedures Manual REF 19. There may be references to other activities
that may impact across service boundaries. Where appropriate these will be
referenced within the plan.

Contact List

Each contingency plan will document the contacts for initial contact and technical
liaison where appropriate, together with details of escalation contacts. This will be in
accordance with the Business Continuity Management process.

10.0 Deliverables and Acceptance Methods

10.1 Introduction

This section defines the deliverables required to satisfy the Business Continuity
requirements of Fujitsu Services (Pathway).

Also included within this section is the method of acceptance planned for each
deliverable.

Section 7.2.1 of this document defines the technical and initial business continuity
testing for the CSR release. The business continuity initial test results for CSR were
published in the Business Continuity Operational test Report (1999) REF47.

Section 7.2.2 of this BCF defines the initial business continuity tests that are to be
conducted as part of the Network Banking Service Acceptance Process.

Methodologies used in the acceptance process include those identified below:

10.1.1 Joint Review

Joint review is by circulation of, discussion about and agreement upon the structure
and content of a document by Fujitsu Services (Pathway) and Post Office Limited.

10.1.2 Document Inspection

Formal inspection of a paper copy, by Post Office Limited, of a commercially
sensitive (i.e. technical design) or Service Provider (i.e. Fujitsu Services Core
Services) operational document, by the appropriate reviewing authorities, whilst
under supervision by the document owner. No paper or electronic copies must be
taken. Objective of this process is to verify the existence of the document; no
approval rights are associated with this activity.

Inspection to take place at the premises of the document owner.

10.1.3. Procedural Walkthrough

A paper based technique whereby a scenario is selected and the actions and
procedures of those Service Delivery Units (SDU) impacted followed through to
ensure that both individual service delivery unit procedures, and cross boundary SDU
procedures, are both complete and fully integrated. Where appropriate, i.e. affecting
Post Office Limited services, Post Office Limited will be invited to procedural
walkthroughs.

10.1.4 Operational Test

An exercise using live operational service components, or where more appropriate
and agreed by Post Office Limited a test environment, whereby a scenario is selected
and the actions and procedures of those Service Delivery Units (SDU) impacted are
followed through. This is to ensure that both individual service delivery unit
procedures, and cross boundary SDU procedures are both complete and fully

integrated, and that the desired outcome on the operational service components is
achieved. This is then followed by the total regression of any changes made to the live

service components.

An example of live operational functionality testing was the Campus Fail-over test
that was conducted during CSR Live Trial. An example of a business continuity
operational test in a test environment is the verification of recovery procedures for the
Reference Data RDT Host.
