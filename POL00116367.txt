Dear Paula

Please find attached the revised briefing for the meeting on Monday with MPs.

In addition we have produced a summary of correspondence into your office from those MPs who have said to
James they are attending, as well as those we believe may attend. There is also a high probability that some of
the MPs who have said they will attend will send their researchers.

Many thanks to Sophie and Simon for their work on this.

Cheers
Mark
