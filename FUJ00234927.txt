SCHEDULE D1
CHARGES
1 GENERAL
1.1 All amounts set out in this Schedule are before adjustment for RPI as set out in paragraph

16 and exclusive of VAT.

All annual Charges set out in this Schedule D1, unless otherwise stated, relate to
Financial Years. All monthly Charges relate to calendar months. All Charges shall, unless
stated otherwise, become due for payment on a monthly basis in accordance with the
provisions of Schedule D2.

Where during the term of this Agreement any charge under this Schedule D1 is amended
by approved CCN the Parties shall set out in the table contained in Annex E to this
Schedule D1 the number of the approved CCN, the amount of the variation and the date

on which the revised charge becomes effective.

In consideration for the provision by Fujitsu Services of the relevant Services, Post Office
shall pay to Fujitsu Services the following:

1.4.1. Operational Charges in accordance with paragraph 2 as varied in accordance
with paragraphs 4 and 5;

1.4.2 additional Operational Charges in accordance with paragraph 6;

1.4.3. Call Off Charges in accordance with paragraph 7;

1.4.4 Charges for Service Integration Services in accordance with paragraph 8;

1.4.10 PIN Pad Procurement Charges in accordance with paragraph 14;

1.4.11 Charges for Hardware in accordance with paragraph 15;

1.4.12 the Gain Share payments set out in Annex G; and

The Charges have been based on an assumption that the numbers of Branches, Counter
Positions, Old Style Mobile Configurations, New Style Mobile Configurations, CTOs and

New CTO Configurations in each Financial Year will not exceed the numbers

Position Limits” in Part 1 of Annex A. Should this assumption not be satisfied, as
evidenced by:

1.5.1. Post Office providing a forecast of numbers of Branches, Counter Positions, Old
Style Mobile Configurations, New Style Mobile Configurations, CTOs or New CTO
Configurations which exceed the limits set out in that Table for that Financial Year;
or

1.5.2 the actual number of Branches, Counter Positions or CTOs exceeding the
applicable limits in any three consecutive months,

the Parties shall agree changes to the Charges or Service Descriptions under the Change
Control Procedure to deal with additional equipment required by Fujitsu Services to
perform its obligations under this Agreement or the lack of availability of such equipment
for spares, maintenance or Operational Business Change purposes.

Services which cause or would cause the limits in the Table in Part 2 of Annex A to be
exceeded or the conditions specified in that Table not to be satisfied shall be subject to
the Change Control Procedure.

In this Schedule D1, unless stated otherwise, any reference to a paragraph or Annex is
to the relevant paragraph of, or annex to, this Schedule D1.

Without prejudice to any Charges which shall have become due to be paid by Post Office
to Fujitsu Services, and subject to paragraphs 9.2 and 9.3, if any Terminable Service is
subject to Partial Termination, the Operational Charges in respect of each Service
comprised within that Terminable Service shall not be payable in respect of the period
after the date of such Partial Termination.

For the purposes of this Schedule D1, from approval by Post Office of a part 2 Exit
Plan for a particular Operational Service, “Counter Positions" shall mean those
Counter Positions that are supported by Fujitsu Services and "Branches" means those
Branches that are supported by Fujitsu Services with respect to that Operational
Service. For the avoidance of doubt, once a particular Operational Service, Counter
Positions or Branches is/are supported by a Next Supplier or any other supplier (and
not Fujitsu Services) it/they shall cease to be “Counter Positions” or “Branches” for
such Operational Service for the purposes of this Schedule D1.

Example

Day 1 - Fujitsu supports the same 100 Counter Positions in respect of both the Engineering
Service and the Service Desk Service.

Day 2 - There is a ramp down of the Engineering Service and 50 Counter Positions become
supported by a Next Supplier while the remaining 50 Counter Positions are still supported by
Fujitsu. There is no change in respect of the Service Desk Service.

From Day 2, the number of Counter Positions for calculating the variable charge for the
Engineering Service would be 50 but it would still be 100 for the Service Desk Service.

has been approved under the Change Contro! Procedure then Post Office shall pay to
Fujitsu Services in respect of each month the net of the Belfast Data Centre Facilities,
Fixed Charge in respect of that month reduced by a sum of sixty six thousand, nine
hundred and twelve pounds and thirty six pence (£66,912.36) per month for the remainder
of the notice period and Post Office shall not be responsible for any dilapidation costs or
charges unless specifically agreed pursuant to the Change Control Procedure.

MARGIN PROTECTION

If in any of the Financial Years 2008/9 to 2011/12 (inclusive) the aggregate amount of all
the Operational Charges calculated in respect of that Financial Year by reference to a
Margin Rate (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt and for the purposes of this paragraph,
any "Late Cost to Post Office" applicable in respect of such Margin Rates in accordance
with paragraph 4.2.3) (plus the margin calculated in respect of that Financial Year in
accordance with paragraph 2.9.2(b)(i)) shall be less than the Protected Margin for that
Financial Year, then Post Office shall pay to Fujitsu Services an amount equal to the
difference.

The amount paid by Post Office in accordance with paragraph 3.1 in respect of any
Financial Year shall be available to Post Office as a credit to be applied against the margin
on any new Services agreed under the Change Control Procedure which Post Office
obtains from Fujitsu Services in that Financial Year, provided such new Service is
provided for longer than twelve months.

Any credit available to Post Office pursuant to paragraph 3.2 shall be made available
monthly throughout the Financial Year in question based on estimates made on a year to
date basis in respect of each month. As soon as reasonably practicable following the end

of each such Financial Year the actual amount available by way of credit during that
Financial Year shall be calculated. If the amount available as a credit in respect of the
Financial Year as so calculated is greater than the aggregate of the monthly credits
actually made available to Post Office during that Financial Year the difference shall be
made available to the Post Office as an additional credit on the basis set out in paragraph

2. If the amount available as a credit in respect of the Financial Year as so calculated
is less than the aggregate of the monthly credits actually utilised by Post Office during
that Financial Year then the Post Office shall repay to Fujitsu Services an amount equal
to that shortfall.

In settlement of the incorrect calculation and invoicing by Fujitsu Services of margin
protection payments during the period April 2008 up to and including August 2009, the
parties have agreed that Fujitsu shall pay back to Post Office the sum of £339,396
erroneously paid out by Post Office during such period in margin protection payments.
£300,000 of such sum shall be repaid upon signature by the parties of the POLSAP Phase
1 Live Service CCN, and the balance shall be repaid upon signature of CCN 1268, each
as a credit to Post Office to be offset against monthly Operational Charges.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, such repayment by Fujitsu
shall not operate so as to reduce the aggregate amount of Operational Charges paid by
Post Office in the relevant Financial Year and so triggering margin protection payments
by Post Office pursuant to paragraph 3.1 above.

With effect from September 2009, without prejudice to its other obligations in relation to
margin protection, Fujitsu Services shall apply correctly the margin calculation at
paragraph 2.9.2 (b) (ii) above.

VARIATION OF OPERATIONAL CHARGES - TRIGGER POINTS

Assumptions have been made by the Parties about the timing of certain events set out in
the Trigger Point Table (referred to as "Trigger Points") in settling the amounts of the
Operational Charges.

For the avoidance of doubt, the planned dates in the Trigger Point Table shall not be
changed to reflect any changes that might be made to the HNG-X Programme Plan and
no adjustment shall be made to the Operational Charges in relation to Trigger Points
other than pursuant to paragraphs 4.2.3 or 4.2.4, unless the Parties agree otherwise
under the Change Control Procedure.

The principles that shall apply for adjustment to the Operational Fixed Charges and
Operational Unit Charges when Trigger Points occur early or late are as follows:

4.2.1 Not Used

4.2.2 In the event that Project HNG-X is terminated either pursuant to (i) Clause 47.15
(but only as a consequence of the Agreement terminating pursuant to Clause 47.4
or 47.7) or (ii) Clause 47.11.2, then the dates stated in the Trigger Point Table for
such of the Trigger Points that are planned to occur after HNG-X Initial
Acceptance (being, for the avoidance of doubt, Trigger Point T6 (Counter
Application Roll Out Complete) only) shall be put back (for the purposes of this
paragraph 4 only) to the date of the expiry or earlier termination of the Agreement,

provided that in each case such termination of Project HNG-X occurred prior to
HNG-X Initial Acceptance.

The Operational Fixed Charges and/or Operational Unit Charges (as specified in
the final column of the Trigger Point Table) for the Operational Services
corresponding to the Trigger Points (if any) adjusted in accordance with
paragraph 4.2.2 shall each be increased in each complete calendar month in the
period by which such Trigger Points are put back, by the amount of the "Late Cost
to Post Office" (if any) specified in the Trigger Point Table.

If any of the Trigger Points are delayed beyond the planned dates specified in
the Trigger Point Table, then to the extent that the delay was:

(a) caused by a Default or delay of Post Office or any of its employees,
agents or subcontractors, then Fujitsu Services shall be entitled to
increase the Operational Fixed Charges and/or Operational Unit Charges
(as specified in the final column of the Trigger Point Table) for the
Operational Services corresponding to that Trigger Point (as identified in
the Trigger Point Table) in each complete calendar month during the
period of that delay or Default by the amount of the “Late Cost to Post
Office” (if any) specified in the Trigger Point Table;

b) not caused by a Default or delay of Post Office, or any of its employees,
agents or subcontractors, then, without prejudice to any other right or
remedy of Post Office, Fujitsu Services shall continue to charge Post
Office the relevant Operational Charges in Annex C of this Schedule D1
without any adjustment.

Services introduced by CCN

Post Office may terminate the Services introduced by (i) CCN641a and (ii) CCN807 and
CCN1163 (as listed in the CCN Service List), by raising a CCN to terminate such Service,
subject to Fujitsu Services being entitled to reimbursement by Post Office of its
reasonable costs incurred in the termination of such Service by raising an invoice in
accordance with Schedule D2 in respect of such costs as they arise. If such Services are
so terminated, an amount per month equal to the monthly charge value for each such
Service (as set out in column three of the CCN Service List for the CCN introducing the
Service in question) shall be deducted from the Operational Fixed Charge for the Data
Centre Operations Service.

All of the Services introduced by CCN (as listed in the CCN Service List), other than
CCN641a, CCN807 and CCN1163, shall terminate in sequence with the migration of the
related Client systems from their existing interfaces with the Infrastructure to the EDG.

If following notice given by Post Office and development of an alternative approach any
of the Client systems referred to in paragraph 5.8 shall not have been migrated to the
EDG by the date of completion of HNG-X Project Workstream X2 (Migrate Data Centre
to HNG-X configuration), the Services introduced by CCN (as listed in the CCN Service
List) related to those Client systems shall continue and, with effect from that date, the
Charges for those Services set out in the CCN Service List shall be payable by Post Office
to Fujitsu Services until the relevant Client systems have been migrated to the EDG.

Periodic review of the CCN Service List to update it for additions and deletions shall be
managed by the Commercial Leads.

For the avoidance of doubt all variable Operational charges as listed in Annex B Schedule

Impact of termination or expiry of the Service Desk Service on the Engineering Service:

5.12.1 At the date of CCN1400, it was acknowledged that the termination of the Service Desk

Service may have an impact on the volume of Engineering Service visits to Branches.
To this end, it is agreed that the Engineering Service shall be subject to Branch visit
volume baselines to be agreed between the parties (the “Expected Engineering
Volumes”) calculated by reference to the Engineering Reference Period in accordance
with the process set out below. This baseline shall be set out in a formal exchange of
letters.

5.12.2 With respect to the Engineering Service, Fujitsu Services shall record the volume of

Engineering Service visits to Branch and shall provide to Post Office data relating to

Schedule D1 Version 15.0
Page 16 of 96

FUJ00234927
FUJ00234927
FUJ00234927

CONFIDENTIAL

engineering visits in the Engineering Reference Period. The "Engineering Reference
Period” will be the later of either:

a) Six complete calendar months immediately prior to commencement of
rampdown of the Service Desk Service; or
b) Six complete calendar months immediately prior to notification of termination of

the Service Desk,

5.12.3 The Engineering Reference Period will be used to generate a forecast of expected
volume of Engineering Service visits to Branches for the period where Fujitsu Services
is providing the Engineering Service but the service desk is provided by a Next Supplier
(i.e. after the Service Desk Service has been terminated) so as to enable the parties to
agree the “Expected Engineering Volumes”.

5.12.4 In order to determine the Expected Engineering Volumes:

a) Post Office and Fujitsu Services shall jointly normalise the volume of visit data
measured during the Engineering Reference Period to take account of

i) particular circumstances occurring at any point in the Engineering
Reference Period;

ii) any peak periods included in the Engineering Reference Period,
whereby downward adjustments shall be made based on a reversal of
the uplifts (adjusted for any particular circumstances at that time)
experienced for each month in the same peak period in the prior year.

b) Normalisation will only be applied to significant programmes that have
materially impacted the Expected Engineering Volumes. Historic examples of
where this has been the case are the introduction of new media to Epson
printers which generated circa1000 additional engineering visits per month and
the programme rollout of new PIN Pads that generated circa 400 additional
engineering visits per month.

c) An 8% variance will be applied to the agreed volumes to generate upper (108%)
& lower (92%) threshold for each month.

d) With respect to months October to December (inclusive), an additional “peak
uplift” shall be applied to the Expected Engineering Volumes. The increased
percentage shall be applied for these months to take account of the expected
greater volumes of Engineering visits to Branches. The peak uplift in 2012
was as follows :-

i) October +10.0%
ii) November +19.7%
iii) December +12.7%

For the avoidance of doubt, months January to September (inclusive) will be considered
normal (non peak) months for the purpose of this calculation (and shall therefore only
be subject to the variance highlighted in paragraph c) above.

5.12.5 The agreed volumes together with the upper and lower thresholds and peak uplift
determined in accordance with paragraph 5.12.4 above shall form the Expected

Schedule D1 Version 15.0
Page 17 of 96
FUJ00234927
FUJ00234927

CONFIDENTIAL

Engineering Volumes. In addition, the Expected Engineering Volumes shall be linked to
the estate volume of 29,600 counters (or as per the average number of counters during
the Engineering Reference Period). If the actual estate size varies materially (+/- 1%)
between the volume agreed by reference to the Engineering Reference Period and the
period associated with the actual engineering visits measurement, an appropriate
adjustment will be made to the Expected Engineering Volumes.

5.12.6 At the end of each 3 month period following termination of the Service Desk Service, the
parties shall total the actual Engineering Service visits to Branches, this sum being,
subject to paragraph 5.12.10 below the “Actual Engineering Visits”

5.12.7 Should Actual Engineering Visits be greater than the upper threshold for the Expected
Engineering Volumes for that 3 month period, Post Office shall pay Fujitsu Services a
sum equivalent to credits as detailed in paragraph 5.12.9 below for each Engineering
visit to a Branch above the upper threshold.

5.12.8 Should Actual Engineering Visits be lower than the lower threshold for the Expected
Engineering Volumes for that month , Fujitsu Services will credit Post Office as detailed
in paragraph 5.12.9 for each Engineering visit to a Branch below the lower threshold.

5.12.9 For each additional visit over and above the Upper Threshold (108%) for the 3 month
period, Fujitsu Services shall be entitled to charge £125 per visit. In the event that the
number of visits made in that 3 month period is below the Lower Threshold (92%),
Fujitsu Services shall give a credit to the Post Office of £100 per visit. Additional
charges and credits shall be applied to the operational charge invoice and Fujitsu
Services shall provide supporting information.

5.12.10 For the avoidance of doubt, Actual Engineering Visits shall be based on:

a) the number of incidents passed from the Next Supplier of the replacement
Service Desk to the Engineering Service; and
b) the proactive incidents logged by Fujitsu Services (i.e. Bad blocks on Hard Disc

drives), but in this latter category these shall be limited to no more than 100
visits per month. If the actual volume of proactive incidents logged by Fujitsu
Services is greater than 100, only 100 will be counted in the actual Engineering
Service visits to Branches volumes for that month.

The following will be excluded from the measure of actual Engineering Service visits to

Branches:
i) any agreed user self-fix incidents that do not require an engineer to attend the
Branch, provided the Service Desk identifies them, and does not pass them to
Fujitsu Services’ engineering queue;
ii) any repeat visits to Branches with respect to the same recorded incident; and/or
iii) any engineering visits due to issues, or incidents arising from unexpected failure

across the branch network of a hardware component due to age that exceeds a
50% degradation in the MTBF rates (such rates determined by reference to the
MTBF rates occurring immediately prior to termination of the Service Desk
Service), save where such degradation in the MTBF rate can be directly
attributed to circumstances linked to a change introduced at the request of Post

Office whereupon such additional failures (over and above the MTBF rate +

6 ADDITIONAL OPERATIONAL CHARGES

Additional Charges in respect of the Data Centre Operations Service

6.1 a) As an additional monthly Charge for the Data Centre Operations Service, if the
number of SAP Basis Calls per month exceeds ten, Post Office shall pay to Fujitsu
Services £286.21 for each such SAP Basis Call in excess of ten per month.

b) In the event that the parties agree that the Oracle database shall no longer be
within Oracle support then the monthly Charge for the Data Centre Operations Service
shall be uplifted by £30,000 per month and in the event that there is an Incident
involving the Oracle database, support shall be provided by Fujitsu Services on
reasonable endeavours (and as such Service Levels to the extent applicable will not
apply) and time and materials basis in accordance with the Rate Card where Fujitsu
Personnel are used and in accordance with Oracle's then current standard published
rate card (or cheaper) where assistance is required from Oracle. Oracle's position on
support is likely to evolve and future direction will form part of the jointly agreed
technology roadmap as described in Clause 10.9.

10.4B.2 and 10.4B.3, a discount of 18% of the total amount charged for the
Inner Core Team shall be calculated on a monthly basis and applied as a
credit to the Operational Charge. CCN1600 introduced a new Rate Card
effective from 1% April 2016 with discounted rates.

In the event that Post Office removes a full time post from the Inner Core
Team, the following will apply:

(a) As set out in paragraph 12 of Annex 3 to Schedule A2, where Post
Office removes any or all full time posts from the Inner Core Team by
notice in writing, on or prior to 30th September 2014, there shall be no
additional charge.

(b) Where Post Office removes a full time post from the Inner Core Team
after 30!" September 2014 but prior to 1 April 2016, Post Office shall
pay to Fujitsu Services a sum equivalent to the 18% discount applied
in respect of such full time post in a six month period. This amount
shall be invoiced by Fujitsu Services as a one off additional charge for
the month in which the full time post is removed from the Inner Core
team.

(c) Not Used

In the event that Post Office provides notice to increase the Inner Core Team
in accordance with paragraph 11.3 of Annex 3 to Schedule A2 between 1*
April 2015 and 31% March 2016 inclusive, the 18% discount shall only apply
3 full months after the resource is added to the Inner Core Team. For the
avoidance of doubt, this paragraph 10.4.3B shall not apply if Post Office
provides notice to increase the Inner Core Team in accordance with
paragraph 11.3 of Annex 3 to Schedule A2 on or before 31% March 2015.

Paragraphs 10.4B.1, 10.4B.2 and 10.4B.3 above will not apply in the event

The following shall also apply to the Charging for the Outer Core team:

(i) The default pre-committed monthly Charge for the Outer Core team shall be
£150,000.
(ii) Post Office shall confirm its committed monthly spend and the mix of skills in

this team 3 months in advance of the month to which it wishes to apply the
discount. In order to qualify for the discount, the Post Office shall provide its
projected spend for 18' April 2015 to 30! June 2015 on or before 315! December
2014.

(ili) Fujitsu Services shall apply the discount applicable to the committed monthly
spend in each monthly invoice.

(iv) Save with respect to the period April 2015 to June 2015 (inclusive) should Post
Office fail to commit to a monthly spend 3 months in advance or separately fails
to meet monthly committed level of spend they will lose the discount for that
and the previous 2 months. In the event that Post Office fails to meet its
monthly committed level of spend in April 2015, May 2015 or June 2015, it shall
only lose the discount for that month. In both cases, this shall be invoiced by
Fujitsu Services as a one off additional charge for the month in which the
committed monthly spend is not achieved.

(v) Post Office shall receive an additional 1% discount to the Rate Card for each
additional 6 month period that Post Office, in advance, makes a committed
monthly spend. For example, if Post Office were to commit to spend £500,000
per month from 1%! April 2015 to 31st March 2016 it would be entitled toa
discount of 9% on the rates set out in the Rate Card. In order to receive this
discount, Post Office must give the commitment at least 3 months prior to the
first day of the committed period. So, for example, in order to receive the total
discount for 2 years commitment Post Office shall be required to make this
commitment by 31st December 2014.

(vi) There are no individual resource rate card reductions in addition to this
mechanism.

The Development Charges shall be due for payment monthly in arrears.

The Charges calculated in accordance with paragraph 10.4 in respect of work undertaken
for that day by each of the roles below shall not exceed the rates per day set out in the
table in paragraph 10.4B of Schedule D1:

10.6.1 Consultant;
10.6.2 Senior Consultant Manager or Exit Manager and
10.6.3. Senior Manager, Principal Specialist or Transition Director.

Fujitsu Services will be entitled to be reimbursed by the Post Office for all reasonable
expenses incurred by it in providing Development Services, including (without limitation)
travel and subsistence expenses. Fujitsu Services shall notify Post Office in advance of
any unusual anticipated expenses, such as international travel.

Fujitsu Services shall, unless otherwise agreed, be entitled to charge for materials,
equipment, licences, support and other third party charges reasonably incurred by Fujitsu
Services in performing Development Services so as to make a 10% margin in relation to
those bought in elements of Fujitsu Service Cost (which for this purpose shall not include
any Fujitsu Services labour costs).

Unless otherwise agreed, if in any Financial Year Fujitsu Services provides members of
the SIP Team pursuant to Schedule B1.2, Post Office shall pay Fujitsu Services for such
provision on a time-cost basis, being rates equal to the cost to Fujitsu Services (on a
break-even basis) of employing the relevant individuals, taking into account for the
purposes of calculating that cost any averaging required where the relevant individual's
grade encompasses more than one professional community grade within Fujitsu Services’
organisational structure. Such cost shall be certified by Fujitsu Services in accordance
with paragraph 1.5 of Schedule D4.

During the Financial Year 2006/7 the charges for each grade of Fujitsu Services staff in
the SIP shall, unless paragraph 11.4 applies, be calculated according to the rates for non-

The Charges for resources for the SIP shall become due for payment monthly in arrear.

The rates for each grade set out in the table in paragraph 11.2 shall be varied in each
subsequent Financial Year to reflect the costs to Fujitsu Services referred to in paragraph
11.1 (the component elements of which costs are as set out in the table “Breakdown of
Day Rate Calculation - Example Grades’ referred to in paragraph 2 of the CCD entitled
“HNG-X Baseline Open Book Information” (COM/MGT/PRO/0002)) for that Financial Year
as applicable in respect of each such grade, taking into account any averaging required
where that grade encompasses more than one professional community grade within
Fujitsu Services organisational structure. For the purposes of the rates for each grade of
committed resource in the table in paragraph 11.2, such variation shall be on the basis
that Post Office commits at the beginning of the Financial Year to utilising that grade of
resource for 204 days in that Financial Year. Paragraph 11.4 shall apply in respect of
each Financial Year after 2006/7 with the necessary changes deemed to be made to it to
reflect such 204 day commitment applying from the beginning of the Financial Year rather
than the 100 days referred to applying from September 2006.

In each case where a Fujitsu Services SIP Team Member is unable to perform a specified
role due to illness, injury or any other reason outside Post Office's control, the number of
days for which he is unable to perform that role shall be deemed to be included within a
period of utilisation of that role for the purposes of determining whether Post Office has
not utilised a specified role.

Post Office shall pay Fujitsu Services for all Transfer Services provided in the event of
Partial Termination, termination of Project HNG-X, termination of the Agreement or expiry
of the Agreement on a time-cost basis according to the rates set out in the Table in

10.5.

If Transfer Services are provided prior to 31 March 2010, any unused balance at the end
of each month of the pre-payment referred to in paragraph 10.3 may, at Post Office's

17 INVEST TO SAVE MODEL

17.1 Post Office shall make a payment to Fujitsu of £1.3m (one million three hundred thousand
pounds) on ‘1st April 2017, and £2.6m (two million six hundred thousand pounds) in
quarter 3 financial year 2017-2018 (within 20 Working Days from the invoice date) (total
£3.9m) for Fujitsu Services to invest in projects with the aim to reduce Fujitsu Services
cost base for delivery of the Services (the “Invest to Save Payment’).

17.2 In consideration of this Invest to Save Payment, the Operational Charges shall be
reduced by the monthly credit, from 1st April 2017 until 318! March 2023, referred to in
Annex B of Schedule D1 as ‘Invest to Save Credit' (the “Invest to Save Credit’). For the
avoidance of doubt this credit shall be in addition to the Trinity 1 Credit referred to in
paragraph 2.14 of Schedule D1.

17.3 It shall be at Fujitsu Services’ absolute discretion what projects it implements as a result
of the receipt of the Invest to Save Payment in order to achieve the required savings to
its cost base to enable the Invest to Save Credit to be provided without impacting Fujitsu
Services' margin. However this shall be at Fujitsu Services’ risk and as such the Invest
to Save Credit shall be credit irrespective of the operational savings actually achieved by
Fujitsu Services.

17.4 Inorder to enable Fujitsu Services to achieve these required savings it has forecasted in
order to fund the Invest to Save Credit, Post Office acknowledges and agrees that Fujitsu
Services may need to make technical changes to the solution, assets and/or restructure
its resources and/or increase its off-shore capability and as such, to the extent to which
Fujitsu Services is required to ask consent from Post Office to enact these or any other
changes, Post Office shall not unreasonably withhold or delay such consent and the costs
of any such technical change shall be borne by Fujitsu Services.

17.5 The Invest to Save model detailed in this paragraph 17 is separate from the Gain Share
mechanism detailed in Schedule D3 (Gain Share) which shall remain available for both
parties to make use of. However, for the avoidance of doubt, no single project can be part
of this Invest to Save model and the Gain Share mechanism and as such it shall be at
Fujitsu Services’ absolute discretion whether it elects to deliver a project as part of its
commitment under the “Invest to Save” mechanism set out in this paragraph 17 or the Gain
Share mechanism detailed in Schedule D3 (Gain Share). The Parties agree this is fair
given the fact that Fujitsu Services is taking the risk of achieving the requisite savings.”

17.6 The Invest to Save values are subject to the following indexation approach:

a. For the fiscal year 1st April 2017, to 31st March 2018, there will be no

indexation applied to savings and payments.
b. For the fiscal year 1st April 2018, to 31st March 2019, there will be no

indexation applied to savings.

c. For the fiscal year 1st April 2019 to 31st March 2020, there will be an
indexation charge equivalent to 75% of the applicable indexation rate.

d. For the fiscal years 1st April 2020 to 31st March 2021 and thereafter each
year through to the end of the Term, indexation will apply at 100% of the

applicable rate.

CCN1204a April 2008 -

CCN1204a referred to in the table above relates to Post Office's initial order for 10,000 replacement counter printers. The Parties anticipate that Post Office
may, in its discretion, order additional counter printers and that, when the changes to the Agreement necessary in respect of such additional printers are
introduced under the Change Control Procedure, adjustments will be made in respect of the figures in the table above so that they are all positive. In the event
that no further printers are ordered by Post Office, beyond the initial order for 10,000 printers, the negative figures in the table above represent amounts that
shall be paid on a monthly basis in the Financial Years in question by Fujitsu Services to Post Office. The above figures have been calculated on the basis of
an agreed estimate of the value of consumables which will be required in respect of the replacement counter printers and therefore, on or about 1 April 2008,
Post Office and Fujitsu Services shall review the above Gain Share payments in the light of the actual cost of such consumables and those payments may be
amended by agreement between Post Office and Fujitsu Services (such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed by either party) in accordance
with Change Control Procedure.
