Subject: Scope and Resources for Project Sparrow
Attachment: Resources for Sparrow 14 November 2013.docx

Please find attached a note setting out scope and resources for Project Sparrow following the Steering Group’s decision
to separate out the broader Business Improvements Programme from the time limited Project Sparrow.

Angela and I have agreed to effect a smooth transition to ensure that changes do not in any way slow down or affect the
smooth running of the mediation process, This is especially important as I am away next week.

Best wishes
Belinda
