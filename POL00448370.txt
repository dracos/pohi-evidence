Thanks Saf

Of course, happy to discuss.

I’m in Swindon on Tuesday so won’t see you in London.

I can speak on a call after the Board meeting...? Or on Wednesday 1 December?
Let me know what suits and I’ll arrange.

Thanks

Richard

Hi Richard

Hope all is well, both myself and Elliot need some comm’s out ASAP as many PM’s think we are doing

nothing.

Can we have a chat next week when we are both in London and agree on something to go ASAP.
