Mark,

It would appear in the Post Masters report as a transaction but would not be immediately identifiable as a
transaction inserted at the data centre. When examined in the audit trail, which has a higher level of detail,
the exact nature of the transaction is apparent.

Kind regards,

Mike

Thanks Michael,

In respect of the 3rd paragraph, if it does not show up as an insertion — what makes its identifiable?
Apologies if this is a stupid question.

Subject: Questions from the Call

Mark,

Pete is on leave for the rest of the week and he asked me to respond on his behalf.

Having spoken with the team, an example transaction would not be a trivial activity. It would be necessary
to get rig time and a tester allocated in etc.to set up and run a dummy correction and produce reports and
therefore we propose that this is not done.

If such a transaction was inserted by the correction tool, the Post Masters reporting does not go down to the
level of granularity to show that the transaction was an insertion. However, the effect would be clearly
visible. In this 2010 case, the Post Master was asked to produce the report showing the balancing error,
Fujitsu applied the requested correction and then the Post Master re-produced the report to confirm that the
desired effect had been achieved.

As previously discussed with Post Office, in the event of a challenge raised by a Post Master or, for example,
a prosecution, the Core Audit Process provides the definitive detail of the transaction. It should be noted
that within the associated audit log the use of the transaction correction tool would be clearly apparent and it
would therefore be obvious that the transaction had not originated from the Post Master or his/her team. If
this were the source of the discrepancy or potential issue then clearly it would not have originated from Post
Master themselves.

I hope this answers your need. In the event you require any further information, please do not hesitate to
contact me.

Kind regards,

Mike

One final question

It would be good to know how the BT is identified on the branch printout / ARQ data eg. does it say "Balancing
Transaction for £xx"?

Put another way, how obvious is it?

An example would be good if that is not too difficult to produce.

Also, and just to be 100%, presumably any BTP is also included on the ARQ data?

Hi

The following questions came up on the call:

Pilot number of branches in Q1 2010

o Still to be confirmed
Would the transaction appear in the branch print out

o This type of transaction will appear in the branch printout
Post Office want to see OCP 25882

o See document attached
Describe process with controls for a Injecting Balancing Transaction

o See below

If the Post Office have a requirement for the Fujitsu SSC to update the Branch Database by injecting a
balancing transaction the process is:

Issue is described on a Peak incident (the incident reporting system)

Requirement for financial correction identified by Post Office and discussed with Sub Postmaster
Peak transferred from SSC to Development team to write required correction as a script

MSC generated and signed off by Post Office to provide audit trail and authorisation for change
Development upload script to MSC (previously OCP)

SSC verify script as attached to MSC, download and copy to live system

SSC change role from read only to read / write access

SSC perform the data correction

Any change would be a new transaction in the audit log and can be identified under a separate identifiable
login in the branch audit record. All existing transactions are unchanged.

It is Post Office’s responsibility to explain the need for the change and the change that took place with the
Sub Postmaster.

During all stages above marked “SSC” one member of the SSC will perform the action while a second

member of the SSC will witness ("four eyes rule" — see WI). Both names must be recorded on the MSC for
audit purposes.
