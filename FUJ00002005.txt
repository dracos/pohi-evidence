Chapter 1 -
Introduction

1.1. PURPOSE

As part of the Horizon service capability, Electronic Top-Up functionality is being
introduced. This is a method of applying credit to pay-as-you-go mobile phone
accounts and of selling specific type of ‘content’ or PIN products.

Post Office Ltd has appointed e-pay as their Electronic Top-Up ‘acquirer’ interfacing to
the appropriate Network Operator.

This document defines the application level interfaces between the e-pay domain and
the Horizon domain to support the Horizon Electronic Top-Up Service (ETS).

The specification for the e-pay interfaces is derived from the following e-pay
documents:

e Technical Specification [EPAY_TS]

¢ Daily Transaction Feed Specification [EPAY_DTF]
e Error Code Specification [EPAY_ERR]

e Post Office Failed Reversals [EPAY_REV]

The e-pay documents are not contract controlled. This document is the definitive
contractual definition of the Horizon — e-pay application interfaces.

1.2 SCOPE

This document provides a specification of the various application messages and file
flows between Horizon and e-pay and forms part of the requirements baseline against
which the Horizon ETS will be built; it also states any exclusions.

2.2 AUTHORISATION INTERFACE
To support ETS at the counter, e-pay provides a real-time authorisation interface
which supports the following message types:
= Sale
= Refund

= Reversal

There are three types of ETS product available at the counter that utilise the

authorisation interface:

= ETU Product- An airtime sale using a card supplied by the Customer’s Network
Operator

© 2006 Fujitsu Services COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Page 13 of 37
File: ETIFS001v4.2draft AIS.doc Printed on 23/3/2006 9:28:00 by RAD
FUJ00002005

FUJ00002005
Fujitsu Services Application Interface Specification: Horizon to e-pay Ref.: ET/IFS/001
Version: 5.0
COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Date: 16/05/2006

m e-voucher Product - A PIN Product which is an ‘anonymous’ airtime or content
sale with an activation code printed on the Receipt

= PVA Product - A PIN Product where the activation code is contained on an
associated magnetic stripe card rather than being printed on the Receipt

All ETS product types require authorisation from e-pay when being purchased or
refunded.

An ETS product sale at the counter will result in an ETS Agent Server presenting a
Sale Request across the e-pay authorisation interface. An ETS product refund will
result in an ETS Agent Server presenting a Refund request across the e-pay
authorisation interface.

When a Sale or Refund request has been presented to e-pay, e-pay will respond with
an Authorisation Response indicating success or otherwise. The ETS Agent Server
will pass this response back to the counter application and the product Sale/Refund
will complete or be abandoned depending on the Authorisation Response.

In the event that the Authorisation Response times out at the counter, the
Transaction’s status at e-pay is indeterminate. This may be due the Response from e-
pay arriving at the counter after the counter time-out has expired or to message loss
either internally or externally to Horizon. Similarly, during Counter recovery after
failure, the status of an ETS Transaction at e-pay may be indeterminate.

In both cases, a [CO] message is generated automatically by the ETS Counter
application without intervention from the Counter Clerk, and is passed to the Agent
which in turn generates a Reversal Request. Reversals are generated only for Sale
Requests, not for Refund Requests. This Reversal is presented across the e-pay
authorisation interface and the Authorisation Response captured. This is then stored
for audit purposes

Reversals will only be presented to e-pay if the time elapsed since the authorisation
request is less than 50 minutes. All Reversals older than 50 minutes will not be
forwarded to e-pay.

2.3 DTF INTERFACE

Once a day, e-pay generates a single Daily Transaction Feed (DTF) file that is
retrieved by Horizon systems. The DTF records the outcome of each transaction from
e-pay’s perspective. It contains reconciliation information to be used by the Horizon
Data Reconciliation Service. The file is generated and transferred every day of the
year, weekends and bank holidays included.

The DTF contains one record for each Transaction, with Sales and Refunds being
treated as separate Transactions. The outcome of a reversal request will be reflected in
the Sale Request record provided that e-pay can match it with the original request.
Where e-pay cannot match the reversal with the original Sale Request, the reversal
outcome will be reflected in the DTF as a separate Transaction in addition to the
original transaction record.

The DTF is interpreted by Horizon for reconciliation purposes using the rules defined
in Table 12, Appendix D.

2.4 MONITORING INTERFACE

To facilitate timely warning of scenarios where reversals are not being successful, e-
pay generate failed reversal summary files on a periodic basis (initially 5 minutes) that
summarise reversal information for transactions processed in the preceding time
interval.

The files contain information relating to reversals that have been generated by the
Horizon system but have failed at e-pay or at the network operator either because they
have been received too late for action to be taken by e-pay or the network operator, or
because the e-pay host cannot match reversals to their original sales.

These files are collected by Horizon on a periodic basis using FTP. A Tivoli Sentry
monitor will then parse the file and will raise an alert if a threshold of reversal failures
is exceeded.

The files will be generated 7 days a week, 24 hours a day.

Each file’s summary will be based on the 5 minutes of transactions preceding the latest
time stamped transaction (which may not be a Horizon transaction).

Further details including the file formatting are defined in Chapter 5.

Chapter 3 -
Authorisation Interface

3.1 GENERAL

This interface supports message flows between Horizon Agents on ETS Agent Servers
and the e-pay host system.

Messages are conveyed on a TCP byte stream interface as defined in [TIS]. Each
message is delimited by a leading STX message (0x02) and a trailing ETX character
(0x03); these two characters are not considered to be part of the message.

The commentary following identifies how the interface is operated in the context of the
Horizon system.

3.2 SUPPORTED TRANSACTION & MESSAGE TYPES

Figure 3 and Figure 4 identify the Transaction types and message sequence to be used
between Horizon and e-pay. Figure 3 is a composite figure that illustrates two
scenarios:

= Authorisation Response received by the Agent and Counter without a timeout
occurring

= The Counter times out the Authorisation Response and generates a [CO]. The
Agent receives the Exception and generates a Reversal Request. It subsequently
writes the [A4] to the Outlet’s message store for audit purposes alone

Figure 4 illustrates the scenario when the Horizon Agent times outs the Authorisation
Response from e-pay. The Counter will generate a [CO] which is passed to the Agent,
which in turn generates a Reversal Request. When the Agent eventually receives the
late Authorisation Response it generates an Orphan-[A4] for audit purposes only. The
figure shows the case where e-pay sends the Authorisation Response before it receives
the reversal Request, but it could happen the other way round or they could overlap —
they are independent messages

Note that it is also possible that a Reversal Request will be generated where the
original Sale Request has not reached e-pay.

Reversals will not be transferred across the Authorisation Interface under any
circumstances for Refund transactions.

3.2.1 Authorisation Request

ETU Transactions and PVA Transactions are initiated by the presentation at the
Counter of a magnetic stripe card in conformance with ISO 7810-7813, identified as
valid for such Transactions within the Post Office Ltd supplied Reference Data. The
normal mode of use will be swipe-captured data. The use of manually entered card
data is supported (if allowed by the Reference Data), with an appropriate Message
Type used.

For these Transactions, manual entry may not be used for Refunds. This is controlled

by Post Office Ltd supplied Reference Data. Swipe-captured data must be used for a
Refund even when the original Transaction was entered manually.

e-voucher Transactions are initiated by the Counter Clerk by selecting the requested
product. The Post Office Ltd supplied Reference Data for the product contains the

“card number” (PAN) to be used. The Sale Request is treated as though a card has
been manually keyed. The Refund will also be treated as manually keyed.

Table 5 in Appendix A documents the message types that will be generated by
Horizon.

Table 4 in Appendix A documents the complete Authorisation Request message format
and data content.

3.2.2 Authorisation Response

The Authorisation Response message will always include the Transaction Amount
field. If the Request is authorised, then the authorised amount will always be equal to
the requested amount.

A Response Code of ‘00’ indicates successful authorisation/reversal. e-pay will also
return a Short Code value. This Short Code along with the IIN and Product code is
used by the counter to look up the Horizon receipt text. The Short Code definitions
and accompanying receipt texts are detailed in [RCPT_TXT].

[RCPT_TXT] defines the failure Response Codes that are supported across the
Horizon — e-pay interface and the corresponding receipt texts.

Table 6 in Appendix A documents the Authorisation Response message format and
data content.

3.3 TRANSACTION IDENTIFIERS AND MESSAGE NUMBERS

All Sale Request, Refund Request and Reversal Transactions are initiated by Horizon
at a Counter PC. Reversal Transactions are generated by the ETS counter application
only, never by the action of a Clerk.

3.3.1 Retailer Transaction Reference

Each Sale or Refund Transaction will be allocated a Horizon Transaction Identifier by
Horizon at the Counter. The Retailer Transaction Reference used as part of the
Authorisation Request and Response messages across the Horizon to e-pay interface
will be constructed from the Horizon Transaction Identifier and the counter receipt
date and time. This will provide a unique reference value for each ETS transaction
across the Horizon estate.

The Retailer Transaction Reference as defined in Appendix A, is an alphanumeric field
however e-pay convert any lowercase characters present to uppercase prior to
processing. Therefore only uppercase characters should be used in this field.

A Reversal Transaction quotes the same Retailer Transaction Reference as the original
Transaction.

3.3.2 Unique Transaction ID

For each Transaction a product specific Unique Transaction ID (for a PIN Transaction
this is known as the PIN Serial Number) is returned in the Authorisation Response
from e-pay.

File: ETIFS001v4.2draft AIS.doc Printed on 23/3/2006 9:28:00 by RAD
FUJ00002005

FUJ00002005
Fujitsu Services Application Interface Specification: Horizon to e-pay Ref.: ET/IFS/001
Version: 5.0
COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Date: 16/05/2006

For a Refund Request, Horizon returns the Unique Transaction ID in the Original
Transaction ID field.

When the ETS counter application generates a [CO] (leading to a Reversal Request to
e-pay), the Authorisation Response from e-pay will not be available. Therefore, the
Reversal Transaction will not contain the Unique Transaction ID — the original
Transaction is identified by the Retailer Transaction Reference.

In certain cases where e-pay responds to reversal requests with an error response, e-
pay will not return a unique transaction ID because e-pay has not generated a reversal
request to the network. This will happen for example when e-pay cannot match the
reversal request to the original transaction.

3.3.3 Message Number

The Message (sequence) Number on the Request message is generated by the ETS
counter application starting at 0000 and incrementing by one for each ETS
Transaction. A Refund Request has a different Message Number from the original
Sale Request. Once 9999 has been reached the Message Number is reset to 0000 on
the next transaction. The counter uses the same sequence number for DCS and ETS
therefore the message number used for consecutive ETS transactions on a counter may
increment by more than 1.

For a Reversal, e-pay allows either a new Message Number or the same Message
Number as used on the original transaction. This AIS does not constrain Fujitsu
Services as to which option to adopt.

3.4 TRANSACTION DUPLICATES AND TIMEOUTS

3.4.1 Duplicate Authorisation Requests

There are very rare failure or recovery conditions which can lead to a duplicate
instance of an Authorisation Request being presented across the Horizon to e-pay
interface (arising from a single Transaction at the Counter). e-pay will process each
independently, which will result in funds being credited twice to the Customer’s
account with his/her Network Operator. Horizon will react to the first Authorisation
Response it receives. Any subsequent Authorisation Response will not be processed.

The ETS will not match a duplicate Response message from e-pay against the Request,
so there are no circumstances that may result in a duplicate [A] message being
processed at the Counter.

3.4.2 Duplicate Reversal Requests
To improve the likelihood of e-pay receiving Reversals within 10 minutes, each
Reversal will normally be sent twice to e-pay. See also section 3.4.4.

All Reversal attempts including duplicates and the consequent outcome in the DTF,
are determined using the rules defined in Table 2.

© 2006 Fujitsu Services COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Page 19 of 37
File: ETIFS001v4.2draft AIS.doc Printed on 23/3/2006 9:28:00 by RAD
FUJ00002005

FUJ00002005
Fujitsu Services Application Interface Specification: Horizon to e-pay Ref.: ET/IFS/001
Version: 5.0
COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Date: 16/05/2006

To protect the e-pay systems, the maximum rate of Reversals across the Horizon/e-pay
boundary will be throttled to a maximum of 20 a second.

Where duplicate Reversals match an ETS transaction, the final reversal outcome will
be recorded in the appropriate fields of the Message Type 01 record for the transaction
in the DTF. e-pay will reverse the relevant transaction once and once only.

If the first reversal matches against the top-up and is successful then the second (or any
subsequent reversals) will fail with "Void already processed" because the reversal has
already been processed. However, if e-pay receive duplicate Reversals within a very
short duration of time (within several milliseconds of one another) it is possible that
the second duplicate Reversal will also be processed. To reduce the likelihood of this
occurring, for each duplicate Reversal pair, one Reversal will be delayed by 13
seconds.1

Where duplicate Reversals are received for a declined ETS transaction, e-pay will not
be able to match the Reversals to the transaction, therefore cach Reversal will be
represented in the DTF file as a separate failed Reversal record.

3.4.3 Authorisation Request Timeouts

The ETS will operate timeouts at the Counter PC and across the Horizon to e-pay
interface.

At the Horizon to e-pay interface, a timeout value will be applied against the period
between generating an Authorisation Request and receipt of the Authorisation
Response message. The timeout value is set at 18 seconds. Any response received
from e-pay after the timeout period has expired is discarded. When the timeout period
is exceeded, the Horizon system informs the Counter application, which immediately
generates a [CO] message. The Reversal Request message is harvested by two
independent agents both of which generate a reversal to e-pay to maximise the
likelihood of the reversal being successful. e-pay may receive one or both Reversal
Requests before having timed out the response from the Network Operator. In these
circumstances e-pay will reverse any authorisation subsequently returned by the
Network Operator. No Authorisation Request retries will be implemented by the
Horizon system.

In the scenario above e-pay will respond to the reversal request with an error code
indicating ‘void pending’ which means that e-pay has received the reversal request and
subsequently will go on to execute a reversal with the network if necessary. This
means the reversal may eventually be successful even though an error code was
returned in the reversal response. This will be represented in the DTF file as a
successful reversal within the original Sale Request record.

If the Sale Request failed at the network, e-pay would have no need to subsequently
send a reversal and this will be represented in the DTF as a failed Sale Request
transaction.

If the Authorisation Request is declined and the Authorisation Response times out, e-
pay will not match the two Reversal Requests with the original Authorisation Request.

1 Due to duplicate Reversals being generated by independent agents there is no absolute guarantee that the delay will always be
sufficient to avoid simultaneity

Version: 5.0
COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Date: 16/05/2006

This will result in three records in the DTF file, one for the original declined Sale
Request and one of each of the Reversal Requests.

3.4.4 Reversal Request Timeouts

Where a Reversal Request message is generated, the timeout used for reading the
Reversal Response is much longer and on e-pay’s advice will be set to 60 seconds.
(Horizon uses the Reversal Response simply as an acknowledgement that the Reversal
Request has been received by e-pay, no interpretation of the Reversal Response will be
performed.)

In certain failure scenarios, for example following a network problem across the
interface, Horizon will retry the reversals. These Reversal retries will only occur if less
than 50 minutes has elapsed since the authorisation request.

Reversal retries will use Message Type 25 as identified in Table 5.
3.5 SYSTEM QUALITY ATTRIBUTES

3.5.1 Security

No application level encryption or signing (MAC check) is used on the Authorisation
Request or Authorisation Response messages including PIN values. However, all ETU
transactions are carried using standard Horizon data transport facilities, which includes
encryption for some network segments. Additionally, the WAN connections used to
connect Horizon and e-pay data centres are protected by encryption. For further
details see [TIS].

3.5.2 Scalability

There are no scalability implications at application level. The concurrency of the
application level interface is bounded by

=the speed of the physical communications interface(s) and
= the number of available concurrent circuits and their re-use policy

These characteristics are specified within the [TIS].
3.5.3 Resilience and Fail-over

Resilience is provided by supporting concurrent operational interfaces between each of
the two Fujitsu Services Campuses and the e-pay operational sites.

Failure of an ETS Agent Server will affect approximately 25% of outstanding Request
Transactions. In these cases outstanding requests are not recovered and the Requests
for authorisation will time out at the Counter. Normally, a standby ETS Agent Server
will become active within a minute, at which point all subsequent Request Transactions
will be passed to e-pay. Reversal Requests will not be lost but may be delayed and
duplicates will occur. Reversal Requests are normally passed twice to e-pay by
independent ETS Agents (see section 3.4.3). It is possible that a Reversal Request will
only be received by e-pay once in some error conditions. The use of independent ETS

Version: 5.0
COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE Date: 16/05/2006

Agents increases the likelihood of the Reversal Request being received within 10
minutes of the original transaction in the event of an ETS Agent failure.

Failure of the e-pay authorisation host or site will result in all outstanding Requests
being timed out at the Horizon to e-pay interface (or in some cases at the Counter).
Subsequent requests will be routed to e-pay’s alternative site.

Fail-over to the alternative e-pay site will only affect any outstanding requests (which
will be timed out), provided immediate connection is possible to the alternative e-pay
site.

Failure of communications between an ETS Agent Server and e-pay will result in any
outstanding Requests failing (timing out). The ETS Agent Server will route all
subsequent authorisation requests to the alternative e-pay site.

Failure of Outlet communications will result in all outstanding Transaction Requests
failing. All subsequent Transaction Requests generated at the affected Outlet will fail
until communications have been restored.

Chapter 4 -
DTF Interface

4.1 SETTLEMENT REPORTING

Horizon uses the information obtained from the e-pay Daily Transaction Feed (DTF)
for reconciliation reporting to support Post Office Ltd settlement. The data contained
within the DTF is formatted and structured in accordance with the file definition in
Appendix B.

A DTF is generated every day of the year, weekends and bank holidays included. A
single DTF file includes all correctly formatted Top-Up2 (Message Type 01) and
Refund (Message Type 02) transactions processed by e-pay between 00:00:00 to
23:59:59 based on the e-pay host system clock. Reversals will be matched against
these transactions until 00:59:59. Any Top-Up and Refund transactions received after
23:59:59 will go into the following day’s file.

The Settlement Date will be the day to which the DTF file relates, as recorded in both
the file’s name and in its File Header record.

The file handling conventions to support the file flow are defined within the [TIS].
Details of file names to be used are specified in Appendix B

If no transactions occur on any given day, e-pay will generate an ‘empty’ file at the end
of day that contains only a header and footer record.

4.1.1 File Availability

DTF files will be made available to Horizon by 02:00:00 the day following the day to
which the file relates.

41.2 Detail Records

The DTF file contains an individual detail record for every ETS Transaction. Records
contain the Retailer Transaction Reference to identify the Transaction.

When a Transaction has been reversed, the record contains the net outcome. If e-pay
receives more than one Reversal in a day, the duplicates are ignored in the net
outcome. An “orphan” Reversal record (Record Type 03) is included in the file if, and
only if, a reversal cannot be matched to the Top-Up transaction.

The e-pay Success/Error Code will be ‘0000’ if and only if the e-Pay Returned
Success/Failure Code is ‘00’, meaning Success.

Table 1 — DTF Record Processing Rules

Table I is a matrix of the different combinations of success and failure of the original
Sale or Refund Request and success or failure of any associated Reversal Request. The
ETS uses this matrix when transforming the DTF into a form suitable for input into the
DRS. The processing rules use the e-pay Success/Error Code, e-Pay Returned
Success/Failure Code and Payment Liability Indicator fields when determining the
effect on reconciliation and billing.

4.2 SYSTEM QUALITY ATTRIBUTES

4.11 Security

No application level encryption or signing (MAC check) is used on the DTF file or
data within it. However, the WAN connections used to connect Horizon and e-pay
data centres are protected by encryption. For further details see [TIS].

As [TIS] does not provide any verification of the integrity of the file received from e-
pay, the application on the Horizon system will verify the contents of the file as best it
can. In particular, it will:

= verify that the File Identifier field in both the File Name and in the File Header
record is “EPAY921133” where 921133 is the Retailer Account Number that e-
pay has allocated to Post Office Ltd.

= check the value of the Number of Detail Records in the File Footer record against
the number of Detail Records present in the file

4.1.2 Scalability

There is no limit to the size of a generated DTF file.

Based on the design limit peak day maximum volumes documented in [CD], the
maximum DTF file size will be 26.77Mb based on 17,500 outlets.

4.1.3 Resilience and Fail-over
Files are not resilient to in-flight failures during transfer. However FTMS has the
ability to retry file retrievals. See [TIS] for further details.

No specific measures are provided at application level. [TIS] includes procedures for
fail-over to alternative host sites.

4 It is possible that Horizon will generate Reversal Requests where the Authorisation Request was declined. See section 3.4.3 for
further details.

Monitoring Interface

5.1 REVERSAL FILE SUMMARY DATA

The following summary data is provided in each file:

1. The date and time of the latest transaction on the replication database (which
may not be a Horizon transaction).

2. The total number of sale transaction requests during the interval period. This
means all sales transactions including successes and failures.

3. The number and value of reversal transactions during the interval period that
have been rejected by the network because they are outside the network
reversal period i.e. more than 10 minutes after the original sale transaction.
Other network failure conditions are not considered.

4. The number and value of reversal transactions during the interval period that
have failed at e-pay because the e-pay host cannot match the reversal to the
original sale transaction, i.e. the failure reason is ‘Unmatched Transaction’
This includes any reversals received more than I hour after the original sale
transaction and reversals where the original sale transactions could not be
identified on the e-pay host, e.g. where the e-pay host has not seen the original
sale transactions.

5. The total number and value of reversal transactions in the interval period, both
successes and failures (except ‘Void already processed’).

6. The total number and value of failed reversal transactions during the interval
period. This means all reversals that have been failed by the e-pay host (except
‘Void already processed’) or rejected by the network for what ever reason.

If there are no transactions for an interval period, a file is still produced with the totals
being zero. It is likely that many files produced overnight will have zero totals.

Due to the summary file being produced from an e-pay replication database which can
lag by varying amounts the e-pay production database during the day, it is possible that
the transaction count across all files produced on a given day may not be accurate.

5.2 SYSTEM QUALITY ATTRIBUTES

5.2.1 Security

The summary file is formatted in plain ASCII text. No application level encryption or
signing (MAC check) is used on the Failed Reversal Summary file or data within it.
However, the WAN connections used to connect Horizon and e-pay data centres are
protected by encryption. For further details see [TIS].

5.2.2 Scalability

The file only contains a single record therefore file size is not an issue.

The file is generated from a replication database whose view of transactions may lag
the production database by a period of time depending on a number of factors.
Therefore the transaction set used to generate a summary file for a given interval may
differ from that transaction set on the production database. For example, if there are
two minutes of latency between the production and replication database, the 11:30 file
may report on transactions between 11:23 and 11:28. As latency increases or
decreases, a small number of transactions may be included in more than 1 file or may
be excluded altogether.

5.2.3 Resilience and Fail-over
The summary file is only retrieved to Horizon’s Bootle data centre. In the event of

Horizon data centre fail-over, the monitoring would be suspended until operations
resumed at Bootle.
