Blackwood SPSO - Post Incident Review and Recommendations

1. Executive Summary

POL faces a potential loss of £451k at Blackwood. The chain of events, failures and learning
points are outlined in sections 3-5, but in summary several parts of POL had visibility of this
shortage but relied on the judgment of the Retail Line Manager to continue allowing the branch
to trade. Communications and decisions were taken at lower management levels without
escalation. Nor were there recognised channels for escalation in some areas.

The agent blamed the automated bureau system for the “accounting discrepancy” but we are
not aware of any other offices reporting similar issues. Whether or not theft is proven, failures
in supervision, reporting and escalation must be acknowledged. A challenge to systems
integrity, valid or otherwise, should not have been allowed to fester in this way.

Immediate actions focus on MI and communication. Plans for other audit visits are attached.
A full investigation and interviews is being led by POL Internal Crime.

2. Linkage to “Sales & Service Project”

The recommendations in this report include certain roles for the retail line. The retail line is
well placed for these, given its “hire and fire” responsibility.

The “Sales and Service Project” may take a different view of prime responsibilities. The
business must balance these different needs.

Question o/s

* Tony Utting - prospects of recovery, other arrests

© Martin Norman — cash activity levels — whether should have seen rems going to pocket

© Martin F — findings of the s60 issue at Newport Street SPSO. Cash numbers £47k declared and £522k
“generated”. 3 rems of £20k but recorded as one pouch in Horizon. Horizon doesn't allow that? System
blocking it from leaving suspense?

* Cash issues — ATM cash, LFS looks at current holdings and recent transactions rather than having long
run targets, procedural compliance failures with s60 autorems

* Post sevenoaks actions — call people

* Jennifer / Paul Dann follow up - Tuesday

3. Sequence of Events

POL00178577
POL00178577

April 04

The branch began declaring a shortage in its cash account
Audit visit confirmed this as £16k — referred to retail line
Branch had recently gone onto automated Bureau de Change
It had also reinstated an employee who had previously been
dismissed

July 04 Shortage £34k by mid July
2 visits by trainers — staff appeared to be operating as they should
RLM aware from outset but felt it inappropriate to suspend the agent
RLM informed Head of Area

Sept 04 Second audit visit confirmed the current shortage (£451k)
RLM again recommended branch remain open
Issue escalated to GM who decided on temporary closure
2 years overdue rent to POPH identified. Arrest made.

4. Observations

Business Area Observations

1 Retail The decision not to suspend earlier is questionable when the

Line shortage was there so long, become so large and had not been

explained after involvement of trainers and IT systems specialists.

Client Accounts
& Cash
Management

A fundamental principle of cash accounts is that “Balance due to
Post Office” (the residue of receipts and payments at the counter)
should equal the total of the “Cash and Stock Table”. Differences
should be investigated.

This branch has had an ever increasing discrepancy, which the agent
openly signed off against and attributed to problems with the new
automated Bureau de Change system.

From April to September, the “shortage” rose from £16k to £436k.
There was no ownership or process to chase this type of
discrepancy.

NBSC Support

NBSC National Problem Management Team had been in dialogue
with Fujitsu for at least 3 months. Next steps planned by NBSC were
for an “Environmental Check” at the branch (plug connection etc).
We understand from the Fujitsu account managers in POL IT that
they were not aware of this dialogue. Given the size and duration of
the issue they would expect to have been alerted.

2 Trainers

The branch had 2 visits to check how the staff were accounting for
transactions. Both times the trainers concluded that the staff were
accounting for transactions as they should.

3 Audit

Audit visits confirmed the shortage in April and September.
Blackwood appeared in the Audit Risk Model in the interim, but given
the openness of the declared shortage and the line involvement no
repeat visits were made until September.

Security

Internal Crime Team had not been made aware of this branch. Given
the value and duration of incident they should have been notified.

Other Group
Units (Property
Holdings)

Some subpostmasters occupy property owned by Royal Mail. Many
of these tenants are “MSPO” agents, individuals who took over
former directly managed branches in the early 1990’s. There are
some significant overdue debts and these were not communicated to

“Stop Gap” Response to Issues in Branch Cash Accounts

. Identify offices of concern based on best available data — with particular focus on high
cash and high “shortage”/suspense offices (focussing on the risk indicators under

Sevenoaks and Blackwood). Also consider high error rate offices

. Decide whether branch warrants an audit visit, an order to remit cash back or a
challenge of the CACM / debt recovery plans.

. Whether making physical visits or desktop reviews, we may need to ask for or

challenge decisions about (non) suspension and debt recovery

1.1. Can we see any other such danger branches from data today?

Blackwood appears by far the worst branch. At the end of August, nationally, there were:
* 6,667 offices with a shortage ranging from 1p to Blackwood’s £0.4m. Total shortages
nationally were £1.6m
e There were also 6,127 offices reporting surpluses (ie. more cash and stock than
expected based on transactions). These ranged from 1p to £78k and totalled £1.4m
nationally

The top ten “shortage branches” and action plans are as follows. In general they have had
little in their suspense accounts but have reported intermittent or long standing shortages.
Some have also had high value and high frequency of error notes.

Shortage I Office FAD Findings / plans

451 Blackwood SPSO. 364632 I Audited 23/9 and suspended. Write off likely

82 Hertford Street BO 007205 I Audited 15/9 and no discrepancy. Appeared to be an

accounting error which reversed the following week, but
we are now to re-audit. It had not been possible to verify
ATM contents at the 1* audit.

There are also a large number of branches declaring high value surpluses. Again some of
these are long standing. It is not clear what these relate to, nor how they are being dealt with.
On the face of it shortages are the immediate risk to the business, but surpluses may be
equally indicative of branch problems. We will therefore explore the following top ten “surplus
branches’ too in the short term.

Surplus
008405 BLACKPOOL BO 78,151
488641 MARKET DRAYTON MSPO 55,465
374207 HILL STREET SPSO 44,000

210424 CROWHILL SPSO 29,382
082007 ARDGOWAN ROAD SPSO 25,035
158642 BLACKPILL SPSO 24,986

7.2 Could the shortages be understating the exposure?

Yes, if the branch “suppressed” (or stole) moneys paid in by customers, or if it created fictitious
outpayments. The audit visits can only confirm cash and stock on hand. Verification of
transactional data is reliant on front end and CACM back end controls.

With regard to Blackwood, Security have taken the Horizon terminals to Fujitsu. Transaction
data will be re-run and will help answer this question.

In the interim, a summary graph of key client streams by week is shown below. The peaks and
troughs broadly reflect “double pension payments” and other bank holiday period activity. The
decline in pensions activity might be expected based on migration to card account. However,
the decline in Giro deposits may warrant explanation. The nil banking deposits in week 25
data also require explanation.

8. How do we decide where to go on audits?

Our assets audit risk model draws on many tried and tested data streams:
« Reinstated agents — past suspensions being the concern

e Cash specials — may indicate unexpectedly high cash usage

¢ Nil discrepancies — ie. too good to be true?

e Repayment schemes — branches where debts are already in existence
« Management concerns — ad hoc concerns

e Cheques held at period end — none should remain on site at end of day
« Previous asset findings — past experience of this branch

e Error notice activity at this branch — number and value

¢ Losses at this branch

¢ ONCH (cash holdings) variances against “target” - £ and %

¢ “Discounted cash” — declaring high values in unexpected denominations
¢ Cash rises in the week and month on month

A review of the model began last month and is exploring new data streams. These may
include:
¢ Branch / demographic profiling
ONCH variances against predictions
Hardship applications
Frequent queries on cash/stock remittances
High levels of reversal transactions
Abnormal transaction trends

Our audit visits to date this year (periods 1 to 5) can be summarised as:
606 Transfers

668 Closures

78 Robbery / burglary

47 Other

1,200 Risk based visits

2,599 Total number of audits

The risk based audits include the following:

60 From Internal Crime team leads

50 Audit managers directly alerted to issues

350 Compliance only audits

740 ‘Full asset based audits driven by the risk model
1,200

Up to period 4 we have been able to perform all the audits which our risk model identified as
“high” or “immediate high” risk. We have had resource constraints in Scotland.

Prior to “Sevenoaks” we had suspended DMB asset audits due to low incidence of problems
and higher degree of segregation of duties. We have reintroduced DMB audits and will cover
5% of them by Christmas.

Our basic risk model for week 25 identified 364 branches of most concern. 220 of these were
then discounted on grounds of having been audited not long ago or that they were the lowest
priority of the population. 50 of the offices discounted had risk indicators arising purely from
the last audit report rather than new issues. The remainder had error notices or losses

exceeding £1k each week. On further review, 2 of these offices are now to be prioritised for
urgent audit despite having been visited recently. This is because they are now reporting high

shortages.
