5.2 Quality and Compliance Framework

POA has contractual, legislative and compliance requirements placed upon it by its stakeholders and
evidence that these are met is required as part of its Customer Lifecycle Gateways and as part of its
internal and external audits.

POA has begun discussing with BA on how this framework will link into its processes and as a result of
this further discussions are taking place with PO LTD and BA around the framework. SAS 70 is to be
discussed with POL and BA to see if this meets requirements of both BA and PO LTD and enables the
reduction in the level of repetitive audits.

The organisational changes within the structure of Fujitsu will affect these discussions and any
agreement and guidance has been sought from the BMS team as to the impacts of this.

7 Measures

7.1 Customer Satisfaction and Complaints

We have adopted the Corporate CSS approach and these have been aligned with the POA functional
areas. This new format and structure has been agreed with PO LTD. The score card for Operations is
currently with PO LTD for a moderated score for each of the services. The score cards for Programmes
and Projects and Account Management are still outstanding due to staff changes. These issues have
been escalated to senior management.

7.2 Customer Satisfaction Interview Programme - CSIP
All actions from the CSIP for 2010/11 have been addressed and completed.
The CSIP interview for POA for 2011/2012 has been scheduled for the 21°t December 2011.

7.2.1 User Satisfaction - USAT

Customer satisfaction data covering complaints and the USAT surveys from the monthly analysis of
service performance are included below.

USAT for November 2011

USAT scores remain constant; overall score of 4.5 out of 5

Focus within Engineering and HSD will continue.

12 complaints received from a total of 10329 calls taken in October-11
All complaints have been investigated and feedback given.

Justified Complaints Un-Justified Complaints
Equipment Quality 2x

Equipment 1x

Online Services 1x Online Services 2x

HSD Process 2x

No response Required Complaints
Online Services 1x

Engineer ETA 2x

HSD 1x

USAT surveys are conducted each month by the Help Desk contacting a sample of Postmasters
(typically less than 50% respond to these requests). The USAT survey data for October has been added
and this continues to show little change in the levels of satisfaction quoted which remains at acceptable
levels.
