Gareth,

I've spent some time recalculating the CAP42 cash account for Marine Drive and addressing the points in the letter from
the solicitor. I hope it makes enough sense to provide you with a starting point not quite at the very beginning.

Subsequent cash accounts, if needed, should be much easier now I have the mappings set up and some idea of what
numbers need to go where.

I'm now going to look at the loss made in week 42 and demonstrate that it was due to the difference between system
holdings and declared holdings.

If this isn't at all what you wanted, please let me know - I don't really know what I'm doing!
This hasn't had my full attention, lots of people are on leave and Martin landed me with a tricky POLFS/FP issue. Also,

yesterday I got my witness statement which is (as I expect you found) full of things I didn't say or do, including all those
Powerhelp calls.

Anne
