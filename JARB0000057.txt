JKW will be there...

Update = 47 cases under current investigation by Second Sight.

Interim report - to be presented by Second Sight to MPs on evening of 8 July, at
Westminster.

The report will concentrate on a few (two? three?) strongest complaints against the
Post Office.

The report should consider whether there are:

any flaws in Horizon,

any flaws in processes currently followed by the Post Office, or training offered to
staff.

The report should be absolutely clear as to whether there are problems with Horizon
or not.

Final report — details yet to be finalised, but want something by end of year.

17 June - JKW spoke to Richard Brooks by phone. All confirmed. James to call him.
