remain outstanding once S80 has been implemented. This document only includes Peaks
that impact on the counter. Data Centre PinICLs are detailed within document

The Peaks were either: -

To avoid large-scale reference data
duplication, at S60 release some submenus that
are shared by 2 of more branches have been
introduced. For example, the 'Mobile E prods’
menu is specified just once in reference data
but it appears on both the following menus: -

PCO116972 S80C - Session transfer with mails items on Development have analysed the problem and Low Future Release

stack

In the course of testing it has been found that
session transfer with Track and Trace items on
the stack is taking longer than does session
transfer with non-Track and Trace items on the
stack. The length of time it takes has varied -
on some occasions it has been almost as quick
(a few seconds) as a session transfer with non-
track and trace items but on other occasions it
has taken as much as 3 and a half minutes.

concluded the following:

i) All session transfers are thought to be slower
within 2 migration windows:

(1) From Counter Roll-out (Point 20) until
the end of the CAP when the CBDB is
switched off

(2) The last CAP until the first TP inclusive

(ii) However transfers with mails transactions
appear to be taking significantly longer at S80
compared with S75.

As T&T is only in pilot until post $90, it is
likely that this problem will not be an issue for
the bulk of the estate.

Part (i) we can’t do anything about - it is
believed to be only a problem during S80 CAP
to TP migration. So the recommendation is
that we publish a KEL.

Part (ii) is under investigation with Escher.
Component showing problem is Escher

S80D DCS: Can settle cheque by debit card

The Settlement menu was selected with
nothing on the stack (i.e. via the Functions
menu). 'Cheque' was the selected and a value
of £30 entered. This correctly showed on the
stack as 'Pay £30.00'. A Debit Card was
inserted in the Pin Pad and Chip and Pin
selected. Since there was no money owed by
the customer the system should not have
allowed a debit card payment to be made.

This is an unlikely scenario and not a new
problem at S80. It is only a problem if the
Settlement menu is on display with nothing on
the stack — under normal circumstances where
a cheque is used in part payment against, say, a
TV licence, then the max and default amounts
for the Debit card payment are calculated
correctly.

Update: PO Ltd has requested that this be
fixed at S80. The peak has been further
discussed by design and development and both
are strongly of the opinion that to make such a
change at this point would carry considerable
risk. Currently, the reversal receipt is a generic
session receipt (i.e. it is already different from
the Rem and Transfer receipts). This is
because 'reversal' is also a generic function
(used for all modes). To accommodate the
change, reversal functions and receipts that are
specific to Rems and Transfers would have to
be developed. If a change is required then the
details need to be agreed between FS and
POL.

by a problem in Riposte and that that problem

However, in automated testing in which the

S80D EMV: Retail card with invalid LUHN

When a card fails the LUHN check, the
customer is still asked to enter a PIN, before
the error is reported to the clerk. This is
different behaviour to pre-S80.

This change in behaviour is thought to have
occurred between the 557 (S70) and the 560
(S75) versions of the PINPad.

It is an unlikely occurrence (corrupt card or
hardware problem) and the error is handled
cleanly if it ever should occur.

The PEAK will be treated as a low priority
Hypercom problem for further investigation at
S90. We recommend that this PEAK should
be deferred until a later release.
