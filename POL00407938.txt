Subject: Up-date for Exco - Inclusion of Branch Support Programme within Sparrow up-date

Attachments: Branch Support Programme - Exco - 25.6.2014.doc

Hi Belinda

Please find attached the information regarding the progress with the Branch Support Programme to be included with
your up-date on Sparrow. Please let me know if this is what you need.

Kevin,

The content is based around the information shared at our Steering Group and at the Transformation Committee so
hopefully there will be nothing in there which doesn’t make sense. If you have any concerns, changes or issues and I will
make the necessary amendments.

Thanks

Gayle
