SUPPORTING POST MASTERS

5. | had previous experience using Horizon/working at a Crown Office, so | was
able to assist branches with day-to-day queries. We used a computer system
(I cannot recall the name) that helped log calls and where all information to

support queries was available.

RESOURCES AVAILABLE

6. There was also a Horizon kit at the NBSC, which was good to show staff that
had never worked on a counter how the system worked.

7. NBSC was a nice environment to work in. Subpostmasters were the priority.
Reversals, balancing support were pretty common. Processes on how to
complete these tasks were available on the server and easy to locate. We had
a Horizon kit and access to Branch Focus.

8. | believe NBSC provided adequate support to subpostmasters who called for

assistance.
MANAGEMENT

9. Each team was managed by a Team Leader, mine was an Ex Crown Office
Manager so had ample experience herself to support her team. | thought Julie
was a great leader and she had the Post Office at the heart of everything she
did.

KNOWLEDGE OF BUGS, ERRORS, OR DEFECTS
10. | was unaware of any bugs, errors or defects within the Horizon IT System at

the time | worked in the NBSC.
