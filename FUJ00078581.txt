Tuesday 234 February 1999

Management Summary

e With the exception of a number of post-migration reports, all day 7
activity was complete by 8:15pm

¢ Investigation of the two BES issues is progressing

Overall status of MOT testing: GREEN
The management summary status indicators are defined as follows;

Green —_ No major issues which require escalation outside of the testing arena
Amber _ Testing have serious concerns over quality
Red Major system difficulties have prevented progress

Planned ‘Key’ Counter Activity
¢ One single terminal office installed and migrated via Miman.

¢ Business as usual transactions at the three ex-Release 1c outlets and two
NR2 outlets

Actual ‘Key’ Counter Activity

¢ MiMan migration was completed successfully at Celtic. A number of post
migration reporting and adjustment activity was deferred to day 8
pending application of Work Packages at the outlet.
¢ The following BES issues were clarified /added to ;
¢ Casual Agent encashment of Ric generated payment captured on
KPR - further investigation ongoing regarding impact on R2
generated encashments - Initial indications suggest that Casual
Agent encashment of Ric payments IS possible, but results have
been intermittent. Further investigation is underway
« Agreement made between Pathway/Product Management that the
system will ensure that manual foreign encashments will not result
in card impounds, when R2 counters are attached to Ric Data
Centre - The effect to customers of this change will be negligible,
and can be worked-around via use of the Helpdesk

Overnight Processing
¢ Overnight processes ran without incident

Planned Interface Activity

¢ TIP - Transaction files from Pathway
¢ CAPS - Change of Circs., Payment, Batch Stop files and Automatic card
