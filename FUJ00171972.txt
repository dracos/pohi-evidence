and replacement for Gary Potts who has moved on to a new role. [JH] re-
iterated the purpose of the ASP for [RD] benefit.

[SK] explained revised Consignia Audit organisation and that she would be
taking on new responsibilities within CGIA.

Auction : {JH} to email ATES, HSAM and Extraction Procedure to [RD}

No Agenda had been fixed other than to review the items covered at the June
meeting. The meeting progressed on that basis.

OBCS Audit. [SK] reported that the report had been delivered to BA and that
BA had been critical of the coverage insofar that PON/Pathway had not
completely closed the ‘transactions back to ESNS’ loop by means of a
confirmation file report. No further action to be taken.

Broken Audit Trail. This was covered in some detail. [JH] explained for [RD]
benefit how audit solution works, ie two independent archives at two separate
locations; DLT’s not copies of each other but independently written.

[JH] Explained progress on recovery work and confirmed, by phone after
meeting, that recovery would be using standard processes and there would be no
transformation of data other than that which occurs through normal processing.

[RD] enquired about policy to DLT ‘retirement’. Agreed would check this out
during DC visits.

Data Centre Audi I confirmed that she would like [RD] to be present as
an observer during this work. [JH] notified start date and confirmed that would
inform [RD] of actual Data Centre visit dates. Confirmed that [RD] will NOT be
accompanying [GH] on Belfast element of audit.

NB Requirements. [SK] wanted confirmation that we had received and
understood data extraction requirements. [JH] confirmed that volumes were
defined and were being incorporated into Schedule NO1 and the Pathway
response.

joint Audits. [SK] identified two potential areas although could not confirm at
this time. Ernst & Young may identify work to be done and the OBCS audit
may be an annual event, contrary to what was previously thought.

Any Other Business. None
Date of Next Meeting : January 2002. To be arranged nearer time.
