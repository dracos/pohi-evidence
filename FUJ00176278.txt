FUJITSU SERVICES BUSINESS OWNER: Connor Langstone
POST OFFICE BUSINESS OWNER: Darryl Judd
SUBMISSION TO POST OFFICE DATE: 23 July 2020

Description of Change Proposed: (Provide a full description of the change unless detailed in attached
documentation).

Post Office have requested under RTQSR0002456 (previously RTQSRO002349) that Fujitsu
Services continue to preserve Horizon Data as per the previous agreement (CT2616a) until
30" April 2021.

Business Case:
The audit system stores data for either 7 years or 18 months depending on its type. In recent
years, the Post Office have asked to keep the data longer, beyond the standard. Currently it is
set at 6 years.

As a result, no data is purged each evening however in October 2020 the data will start to be
purged. The Post Office have requested that the data is kept an additional time so that
purging does not start until the end of April 2021.

Summary of Wot

A configuration file exists which defines how long data should be kept beyond the standard.
The configuration will be changed so that purging does not start until the end of April 2021.
To be precise the NumExtraHoursToKeepTracks parameter will be increased from 52560 (6
years) to 57480 (6.56 years). This change will be tested in development and test because
although the configuration file has been modified several times before it is always possible
that some system limit will be hit (integer overflowing or the like).

In development there exist VMs representing all the machines in the audit solution. They can
be snapshot. They can as a complete set be advanced forward in time. With the changed
configuration file in place they will be advanced forward in time running the purger and it
will be confirmed that data is not purged until it is expected to be. After the tests are finished
the VMs will be set back to their normal working snapshot.

In the Fujitsu Services test department they are not able to move machines forward in time.
However they can alter the “Until date” and “Until time” of a few tracks in the sealer
database and confirm that an attempt is only made to purge them if that is sufficiently in the
past (57480 hours in the past to be precise). An attempt to purge them will be logged in the
daily purger log. Note that due to Eternus data protection the data may well not really be
deleted. It will only be really deleted if the “Until date” and “Until time” were genuinely in
the past anyway.

Any further extensions requested by Post Office would be subject to a full review of storage
limitations by Fujitsu Services.

Note: Post Office will indemnify Fujitsu Services for any claim made or fine imposed on
Fujitsu Services by a data subject or any other party in relation to the extended retention of
personal data as required under this CT.

CHANGE WORK ORDER DELIVERABLES:
Fujitsu Services will:

© Stop Horizon data purging in October 2020 and will delay this purging until 30" of
April 2021.

IMPLEMENTATION TIMEFRAME:

The implementation timetable is to be agreed between the parties on approval of the CWO
and provision of a valid Purchase Order. This will be based on Fujitsu Services’ current
understanding of the business requirement, the overall forward schedule and already
approved and scheduled work which may be in progress or due to commence.

Changes and/or re-prioritisations of entries in this schedule may be required as a result of
potential impacts/conflicts relating to resource and infrastructure caused by this CWO.

In the event that changes to delivery timescales are identified by Fujitsu Services or Post
Office, such changes shall be discussed and agreed at the Demand Planning Forum and
managed via change control.
