Symptoms

When there has been a malfunction a counter may need to be rebooted.<br>The correct way to accomplish this is to press the
<Ctri> <Alt><Del> keys together and release them together

Problem

Counters are being rebooted or reloaded by switching off the base unit and this may predjudice the integrity of the messages held on the
counter making the possibility of an altogether more serious and resource consuming failure greater.

Solution - Helpdesk

Always reboot using the <Ctrl><Alt><Del> keys unless specifically advised otherwise.<br>if you are advised that the counter needs to be
powered down, the recommended method is to press <Ctri><Alt><Del> and wait until the "Fujitsu" logo screen or "NTDETECT 4.0 Checking
Hardware..." screen before switching the system off via the power switch.
