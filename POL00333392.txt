Subject: Re: Sparrow

Mark thanks for this.

I think it would be helpful for the Exec to have a copy of the positive lines, which reinforce everything we have done.
Could you circulate when ready. Possibly the SLT as well? (Your call.)

I know that from time to time I am asked by friends (and strangers!) about it and whilst I'm quite close and know the lines,
I expect Exec and SLT colleagues are no so well briefed.

I agree our brief is to contain and respond and we should not be provoking discussion, to minimise the attention. But
when asked it would be good to know we all have the same answer that you'd like us to give.
Thanks, Paula
