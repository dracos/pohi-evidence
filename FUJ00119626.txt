tating POL SAP Finance System (Release 1)

1 Introduction

Post Office Ltd has been working with Fujitsu Services and the Prism Alliance to examine ways of
streamlining their business processes and systems. This initiative, the IMPACT Programme (initially called
“End-to-End Re-architecture”), has been broken down into three releases, with each release consisting of a
number of projects. The three releases are aligned to with Horizon releases i.e. Release 1 = Horizon S60,
Release 2 = Horizon S70, and Release 3 = Horizon S80. The new POL SAP Finance system will be
implemented in two stages — Release 1 (S60) and Release 3 (S80).

The first release consists of 3 projects. The second of these projects (Project 2) involves the introduction of a
new SAP service to provide Financial Accounting information for Post Office. At S60 the SAP service is
focusing on Cash Handling, with a fuller financial service being introduced at release 3 (S80).

Fujitsu Services has been given the responsibility for hosting the SAP application service and Prism has.
been given the responsibility of hosting the presentation layer and support of the end user access and
printing. This document focuses on the areas that Prism is responsible for. The focus of this document is on
the first release, but taking into account the scalability requirements for Release 3, based on what
information is available.

The name given to the new SAP system is POL FS.

1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this document is to describe the overall solution architecture for POL SAP Finance System
(Release 1). It describes the design of all components of the solution, within the context of a current
understanding of the business requirements and the shared Prism / Fujitsu responsibilities.

This document aims to deliver enough detail to arrive at a cost for the proposal and a scope and high level
task list for the project definition. This document must be reviewed by the CSC, BT and Xansa Architecture
teams prior to its use as the basis of an estimate or project definition.

1.2 Scope

This document will identify the major business requirements, the constituent applications and infrastructure
components and their respective roles in the context of sample end-to-end business scenarios. Additionally
this document will outline the guiding principles on which the architecture and subsequent physical
implementation will be based. Overall this document and associated presentation will serve as a vehicle for
communication and common understanding and as a basis for more detailed cost definition and project
planning.

However, this document does not attempt to fully define the relative responsibilities of each of the constituent
projects required to implement the required infrastructure nor present detailed cost elements, and equally
does not attempt to align milestones and plans in this respect.

In this document the architecture will take into account those business requirements which have formally
emerged through recent discussion and through improved understanding of the business unit needs, and
any external constraints.

This document covers the whole solution at a high level. It should be noted that:
- Application hosting aspects are owned by Fujitsu Services and are covered in a separate series of
documents managed by them.
~The other Technical Architecture elements are owned by CSC (Computer Sciences Corporation) and
are covered in more detail by a series of documents managed within GIS (Global Infrastructure

Services).

4.2.3, Non-Functional Requirements

The below requirements are compiled from the various reference documents that already exist on this
project:

4.2.3.1 System Resilience
The system should be sufficiently resilient to deliver the required availability.

4.2.3.2 Performance Requirements
Fujitsu Services propose to use SAP Solution Manager to track a sample set of transactions.
Standard SAP reports will then be run at the end of the service level reporting period and details fed into the
Service Level Reports.
The service level target is for 95% of the agreed transactions to be completed within:
"1.5 - <WAN latency>" seconds.
Where this measure is taken within the hosting environment (excluding WAN and presentation layers).

Of the overall transaction time, the response target for time spent in the Prism domain is 0.5 seconds. It is
currently unclear how this could be proven absolutely in a case of dispute.

4.2.3.3 Backup
All components should be backed up to ensure recoverability to the previous day in case of failure.

4.2.3.4 Archiving
To be detailed in Release 3.

4.2.3.5 Service Hours/SLA

The availability of the online SAP service is to be measured between 07:30-19:30 on Monday-Friday (excl.
Bank Holidays).

The service will be measured in 2 parts:

e the host service

¢ end-to-end service

Host Service (Fujitsu Services Responsibility)

The host service is defined as being available if the SAP host system is available to be logged into and there

are no overnight data load jobs still processing.

e The target availability is to be 98.5% (this equates to an average of 4 hours outage per month)

e The maximum downtime permitted during a single outage is 4 hours.

« This service level target is to be measured over a period of 1 quarter

e Although the service is not measured at the weekends or bank holidays, it is expected that the service
should be available 7 days per week (07:30-19:30), except by agreement. The windows between 19:30 to
07:30 is available for batch processing

e Support for the Service should be available during the hours of service measurement i.e. 07:30-19:30
Mon-Fri (excl. Bank Holidays)

e It is expected that the host service should be monitored using standard SAP functionality and that the
reporting should fit in within the reporting framework for Horizon.

Client/Network Service
The client/network service is defined as the SAP client and the associated local area networking to reach
access to the service boundary’ at the Prism Data Centre.

1 The service boundary will be defined during contractual discussions

e The target availability is to be 98.5% (this equates to an average of 4 hours outage per month)

« The maximum downtime permitted during a single outage is 4 hours.

e This service level target is to be measured over a period of 1 quarter

e Although the service is not measured at the weekends or bank holidays, it is expected that the service
should be available 7 days per week (07:30-19:30), except by agreement. The windows between 19:30 to

4.2.3.7 Key Times
TBA

4.2.3.8 Support

Helpdesk support for POL FS will need to be agreed, and where necessary links between all three systems"
for Helpdesk support should be established.

4.2.3.9 Business Continuity Requirements

There must be contingency arrangements in place for the POL FS service.

The maximum outage during failover is 1 week.

At the end of failover the data must be fully restored, but the system can run with a reduced service in terms
of:

e the number of supported users

end-user response times

e the time by which data loads have to be complete

4.2.3.10 Extensibility/Scalability/Maintainability/Manageability
The solution should be scalable to allow future growth.

4.2.3.11 Security

POL are currently undertaking a security review to categorise the importance and security level to be applied
to this solution and the data it contains.

4.2.3.12 Volumes
Peak day figures are:

Source Contracted Volume Contracted Volume line

4.2.3.15 Printing Requirements

Given the shared nature of the infrastructure, specific requirements in the area of printing have been
gathered.

« Number / Location / Type:
- Aratio of 8:1 (users to printers) for the operational service is expected.
- Allprinters to be used are currently on-site.
- They are “SAP Standard Printers” as defined in SAP.
- They are accessible via IP printing.
- Colour printing is not required.

Information based on tests executed by the SAP TCE showed

3 page average content- 28k

4 page average content- 28k

14 page high content - 45k

10 page high content - 450k
This would suggest that average content per page would be approx 10k rather than the originally estimated
5k and so the above figures were revised to reflect this.

+ Security:
- No printed output requires encryption.

+ Availability:
- As per service (detailed in section 4.2.3.6 - Availability)

+ Print Loss:
- No requirement to ensure automated recovery of print data. In the event of a print service failure, it
is assumed the end-user would re-send any print request.

5.2 Summary of Design Constraints

Ref Constraint Impact Action
1 SAP Application &
Database will be
hosted by Fujitsu

Table 5: Design Constraints

5.3 Summary of Design Givens

Ref Givens
CB008 I POL FS will be built as a new SAP system

Table 6: Design Givens

5.4 Summary of Design Principles

There were a number of design principles laid out in [SAPCD]. The ones relevant to this design are as
follows:

Ref Principle
CB021 I One of the principles for the POL FS project is to put the SAP system within the "Horizon domain" to minimise
issues of interfacing between Horizon and the new POL FS system

CB022 I The intention is to set reasonable service level targets, with reasonable compensation for failure to meet the
service. (The definition of reasonable will be determined during the contractual negotiations)

©B023_I The new POL FS system should (wherever possible) fit in with existing processes and management systems.

CB024 I The SAP installation should be a “vanilla " installation, except for the bespoke interfaces required to load data
from Horizon and SAP ADS

Table 7: Design Principles

5.5 Summary of Design Assumptions

Ref ‘Assumpti
1 All users will be accessing the systems using PCs with the Royal Mail standard Platform

2000 image installed on them
2 Client requirement of 50 named users assumed to be split evenly across 2 sites H
3 Assumed to be heavy/professional users H

Table 8: Design Assumptions

5.6 Summary of Design Dependencies
This design is dependant upon the Fujitsu Services Hosting design document [SAPHDP]

6 Application Architecture

6.1 Architecture Model Overview
This SAP solution will be deployed in the following n-tier model:

6.1.1 Client

Clients will access the solution via the standard Royal Mail Platform 2000 desktop image through the web
browser. They will print to standard printers already deployed.
The client access and printing layer is the responsibility of Prism.

6.1.2 Presentation

The SAP presentation layer will be rendered via the standard Royal Mail presentation farm using SAP portal
and web presentation technologies.
The presentation layer is the responsibility of Prism.

6.1.3 Application

The application layer is the responsibility of Fujitsu Services.

6.1.4 Database
The database layer is the responsibility of Fujitsu Services.

6.2 Application Structure Diagram

Please refer to the Architecture Overview diagram in section 5.1

6.4 Application Design Approaches
This section details agreed, specific approaches to the application design.
6.4.1 Demarcation

Application configuration/ development will be split between technology and business, with the application
technology layer (ie platform & application) being the responsibility of Fujitsu and the application business
layer (ie business process execution) being the responsibility of Prism.

6.4.2 Co-operative Processing

Being a solution that is delivered by a standard package, it has its own approach to co-operative processing
that will be used internally and is in the Fujitsu domain of responsibility.

6.4.3 Concurrency Design

Being a solution that is delivered by a standard package, it has its own approach to managing concurrency
that is implemented internally. To support future growth in concurrency, it will be designed to scale.

6.4.4 User Authentication & Access Control

Standard SAP user security will be utilised.

The standard SAP Central User Administration (as currently installed in the Prism NDC) will be leveraged
and control user maintenance in all environments.

Fujitsu will supply details of the users / profiles / roles they require.

Prism will manage all user / profile / role maintenance in line with the current SAP Operating Standards.

6.4.5 Data Encryption

Until POL advise differently, the current working assumption is that application level encryption is not
required.

Name of the interface

Indicate the direction of the data flow. (Sys1 to Sys2) Protocol information about the operation of
the interface is not data in this context.

E.g. Graphics, text, numeric, voice, binary, etc.

E.g, Procedure Call (synchronous), Message Queue (asynchronous), File (batch), Data
Conversion (i.e. Sequential File via a conversion tool or bridge).

E.g. 1 day or more, 1 to 24 hours, 1 to 59 minutes, 4 to 59 seconds, e seconds or less. - Be as
specific as possible to enable Acceptance Criteria to be defined. (This may already have been
defined in Section 4, Performance Metrics.)

How long the data accessed is held, e.g. years, months, days, 1 to 24 hours, 1 to 59 minutes, 4
to 59 seconds, 3 seconds or less.

How up to date the data accessed must be, e.g. 1 day or more, 1 to 24 hours, 1 to 59 minutes, 4
to 59 seconds, 3 seconds or less

Transactional, Non-transactional, Batch restart on failure

Read Only, ReadMrite, Write Only

Period when the interface is used, e.g. annually, quarterly, monthly, weekly, daily, continually,
data initialisation, ad hoc. Be as specific as you can.

E.g. 99% during office hours, 99.5% during the month end period of 3*24 hours.

No of accesses within period, e.g. >1000, 500-1000, 100-500, 50-100, 5-50, <5. Please be as
specific as possible to enable Acceptance Criteria to be defined.

An Initialisation interface may be used once, or more, depending on the retirement strategy.
Volume of data transferred in each access, e.g. single record, single table, database.

The error tolerance on data, e.g. 50%, 11 to 49%, 6 to 10%, 1 to 5%, none. Please be specific.

Any requirement for a service connected to/data access, to run under the security context of the
client process, levels of general access, confidential, sensitive

Impact of failure, e.g. None, Minor, Significant, Unable to function, Business critical
Requirement for audit logging of the interface, if any.

For legacy interfaces: For how long is this interface needed, e.g. until legacy replaced in Release
4.

Automatically invoked; i.e. invoked by the application as part of the functionality, user is unaware
of the interface.

Manually invoked; means that the user has explicitly requested data to be transferred via this
interface.

For batch interfaces. Can be Magnetic Tape, LAN/Wan connection, etc.

This is the function call signature, message definition or file definition.
None, field-to-field, complex derivation.

E.g. the next release may introduce a new interface, or may require an existing interface to
handle much greater volumes of data.

Description and Estimate in Enhancement function points for change required to Legacy System

What is the current state of the legacy data? Is it good enough to be migrated as it is, or does it
need ‘cleansing’ prior to migration?

Any complex interface rules such as data conversion rules.

These will be further clarified in the LTM.

8.2.3.1 Cheques Processed Interface

The “Cheques Processed?” interface will change overtime. At the start of this project, data was sent from
Data Central to OPTIP and then onto CBDB:

The Payment Processing Outsource Project will replace the current Data Central system with an outsourced
service from EDS. Data files will arrive from EDS via the External Data Gateway (EDG) before being copied
to the “Banking Gateway”. From here the user can access them for manual upload to POLFS.

The advantage of this approach is that the process for the end-user should not change.

8.2.4 Technical Infrastructure Component Definition
These will be clarified in the LTM.

8.2.5 Processing nodes
At this time only the following absolute restrictions are known:

CLIENT* (Clients)
All client PC’s need to meet the agreed minimum requirements for a SAP user in Royal Mail:

~ PIll 350MHz with 128MB ram minimum

- 1E5.5°

~ Citrix MetraFrame client
It should also be noted that there are known problems with certain functionality (e.g. downloading local
reports) when a Sun Java Runtime is installed on the PC.

RMSAPPS (Print Server)

During evaluation (by the SAP TCE), running the SAP Ipd service on Windows 2000 proved unreliable when
compared to running it on AIX. It is therefore recommended that the Print Server not be implemented on
Windows 2000 and the AIX platform be utilised.

Nodes will be defined in greater detail in the Prism LTM and the Fujitsu design document.

8.3 Service Management

Details of Service Management are to be clarified.
Current working assumption is that automated alerting is not required for Release 1.

8.4 Backup Strategy

Backup of the application and data tiers are the responsibility of Fujitsu Services.

® Immanent upgrade to IE6 is known and understood to impact the “standard” image.

8.5 Business Continuity Strategy
The business continuity strategy aligns to the three main zones of responsibility in this solution:

8.5.1 Fujitsu Domain

DR of the application and data tiers are the responsibility of Fujitsu Services and are detailed in their
documentation. Any failover occurring in the Fujitsu domain should be transparent to Prism (i.e. IP
addresses etc do not change).

8.5.2 Prism Domain

8.5.2.1 Clients
As the client base is distributed across more than one site, DR of clients is assumed not to be required.

8.5.2.2 Network
The Royal Mail network is distributed and so additional DR of the WAN is assumed not to be required.

8.5.2.3 Data Centre

In this solution, the following nodes are hosted in the Prism NDC and therefore require DR:

« RMSAPPF -— The shared SAP Presentation Layer offers a DR capability that may be subscribed to.

« RMSAPPS —-A Printer Server as used by POL in this solution is not part of the standard SAP Presentation
Layer and so not currently covered by any DR arrangement. POL confirmed that DR of printed output
was not a requirement for S60 and it would be reviewed for S80.

e EDG-The managed EDG service offers a standard DR capability that may be subscribed to.

e BGW -Not currently covered by DR.

Furthermore, to support these logical links also need to be covered:
« EDS toEDG
« EDG to BW

Although standard DR capabilities are available for some of the above components, costs have yet to be
provided to POL. Once in possession of these, POL will clarify the level of cover required.

Required user capacity at Release 3 would be 25 concurrent users.

Any failover occurring in the Prism domain should be transparent to Fujitsu (i.e. IP addresses etc do not
change).

8.5.3. Inter Domain

As Fujitsu Services are responsible for the data link connecting application to presentation, they will be
responsible for providing the link to the Prism DR site. le the logical links

8.7 Security
There are three main zones of security in this solution:

8.7.1 Fujitsu Domain

Security up to and including the Fujitsu Services network termination is the responsibility of Fujitsu Services.
Access from the Prism Domain into the Fujitsu Domain is via one of the following routes:

e Application —- Access to the SAP application via standard SAP user access.

« Network — FTP access to development servers to test file uploads.

8.7.2 Prism Domain

Security on the Prism/Royal Mail side of the Fujitsu Services network termination in the Prism Data Centre is

the responsibility of Prism. It will be addressed as follows:

e Physical — Access to the Prism Data Centre and connected access points will be covered by the standard
Prism/Royal Mail access policies.

e Network — No authentication or encryption is required.

e Application - Standard SAP access control will be used. No encryption is required.

8.7.3 Inter Domain

e Network — Traffic crossing between domains is the responsibility of Fujitsu and will be documented by
them. It is understood that the current approach is to encrypt this data at the network layer using IPSEC.

e Firewalls — Detailed firewall configuration will be held by Prism & Fujitsu Network teams. For security
reasons it will not be generally available.

POL has not yet completed a data classification exercise to understand if the above levels of security meet
their requirements (i.e. is application level encryption required between client and server). The POL Design
Authority has accepted the above as the working assumption and agreed any changes will be handled under
formal change control.

More detailed information with regards to SAP specific security ownership and considerations can be found

in the Prism SAP Documents POLFS-SEC. See section 1.5.1 - Associated & Reference Documents for
version information.
