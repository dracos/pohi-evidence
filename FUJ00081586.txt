fhe trading position difference is 11.2.This is happening due to the There is a discrepancy BFwd for accounting node 3110 which
is 11.2.generally this value should be zero.Some how this value is 11.2 which is causing non zero trading position.

lAccording to document DEV/APP/LLD/0164--~

[fhe brought forward discrepancies (value stock) node 3110 should always be zero, but the BTS will include this node to be correct
should any values actually be carried forward for any reason.

tn this case the value for 3110 is not zero. it is 11.

this is the one creating the diffrence

It am able to reproduce the issue for Non Zero trading Position

steps to reproduce the issue.
clear data from BRDB_RX BTS DATA, BRDB_SU_OPENING BALANCE, BRDB BRANCH DECL<BRDB_BRANCH DECL_ITEM and make SU TP and branch TP same
y setting values in BROB_BRANCH_INFO AND BRDB BRANCH STOCKUNITS

H)Make sure we have one stock unit in our branch
2)sell green giros in front office

8)Declare Zero cash and stock

4) rollover the SU to next BP

5) Declare Zero cash and stock again

5) try to rollover the SU to TR. when you get the message MSG31316 cancel the rollover and rollover to next BP.
6) Now rollover the SU to next TP

7). now rollover the branch to next TP. After preview you can see message trading Position not equal to zero

IThe root cause of the problem has been given in peak PC0204263

Fixing the peak PC0204263 will resolve the Non Zero trading position issue

Yes I agree that the root cause is PC0204263.

hat needs some work with the SSC as to how they correct the branch accounts for branches which have had this problem, and to
find how many branches this fault has effected by checking for the non-zero trading position error 0903.
