SEEMA MISRA

YEARS INPRISON:

YEAR OF CRIME: 2008

YEAR CONVICTION WAS OVERTURNED: 2021

Seema Misra was one of the “Post O@ce 39,” a group
of former sub-postmasters and post-mistresses who
were convicted of o@ences including theft, false
accounting, and fraud, based on information from a
computer system called Horizon which suggested
that money had gone missing from post-o@ce
branch accounts.

Ms Misra pleaded guilty to six counts of false
accounting, and was found guilty of theft following a
trial in the Crown Court. She was sentenced to 15
months’ imprisonment for the theft and six months’
imprisonment concurrently on each count of false
accounting. She was ordered to pay compensation of
£40,000 to the Post O@ce. She served four months in
prison while pregnant.

The basis of each of the prosecutions of the “Post
O@ce 39” was that money missing from the branch
account had been a result of theft by the sub-
postmaster or mistress, or had been covered up by
fraud or false accounting by the sub-postmaster or
mistress. On appeal, the Court of Appeal accepted
@dings that bugs, errors, and defects in Horizon
could, and did, cause discrepancies and shortfalls in
branch accounts. The court concluded that if the
Horizon data was not reliable then there was no
basis for the prosecution, and the convictions were
quashed. The court noted that failures of
investigation and disclosure in the cases prevented
the appellants from challenging, or challenging
e@ectively, the reliability of the Horizon data.
