                                            £40,000 to the Post O�ce. She served four months in                         other
                                            prison while pregnant.                                                      Retrial: N

                                            The basis of each of the prosecutions of the “Post
                                            O�ce 39” was that money missing from the branch
                                            account had been a result of theft by the sub-
                                            postmaster or mistress, or had been covered up by
                                            fraud or false accounting by the sub-postmaster or
                                            mistress. On appeal, the Court of Appeal accepted
                                            �ndings that bugs, errors, and defects in Horizon
                                            could, and did, cause discrepancies and shortfalls in
                                            branch accounts. The court concluded that if the
                                            Horizon data was not reliable then there was no
                                            basis for the prosecution, and the convictions were
                                            quashed. The court noted that failures of
                                            investigation and disclosure in the cases prevented
                                            the appellants from challenging, or challenging
                                            e�ectively, the reliability of the Horizon data.
