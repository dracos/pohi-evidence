The government is determined that postmasters affected by the Horizon IT
scandal receive the financial redress that they deserve.

As of 30 April 2024, £42 million has been paid via the Group Litigation Order
(GLO) scheme. This includes interim payments.

1.1 Notes for table

In the above table, 63 postmasters, out of the 555 who were members of the
GLO, had convictions and are therefore eligible to apply for redress once their
conviction has been overturned.

The remaining 492 postmasters are currently eligible for the GLO scheme, of
whom 484 qualify for interim payments.

Progress continues to be made on distributing shares of the £19.5 million
interim payments announced in June 2022.

For disclosure reasons, the exact number of claims paid is now withheld.

This month, the number of payments has not increased.

Work continues on the remaining payments in complex categories such as
those recently deceased and people who have not taken up the offer of an
interim payment.

2. GLO Scheme delivery target

The Department for Business and Trade (DBT) is committed to a target of
making a first offer to 90% of claimants who have submitted a full claim within
40 working days. A full claim is defined as a claim which DBT considers, with
advice from its legal advisors, does not need any further evidence in order to
assess every element of the claim. Should the department consider further
evidence is needed in order to make a full assessment, the 40-working-day
target will not start until such time that the required evidence is received from
the claimant or any other source.

As of 30 April 2024, 90% of claimants received their first offer within 40 working
days of submitting a full claim.

3. GLO Scheme £75,000 fixed payment
impact

Due to changes made in January 2024, all eligible GLO claimants are now
offered the option to settle their claims on a full and final basis for a total fixed
sum of £75,000 inclusive of interest, instead of making a claim for their
individual losses.

This means that the claim would not be assessed by the department against
the process set out in the guidance and principles
(https:/Awww.gov.uk/government/publications/compensation-scheme-for-group-litigation-

order-case-postmasters).

Any payments received from the department to date or from the GLO settlement
will be deducted from the £75,000 before payment is made.

As of 30 April 2024, 153 offers have been accepted. Of these, 143 have
accepted offers of the £75,000 fixed payment. Of those who have accepted the
£75,000 fixed payment, four-fifths are new claims and a fifth had previously
accepted offers.
