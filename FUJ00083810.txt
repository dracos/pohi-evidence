This office had severe problems balancing on Wk 25, resulting in a
shortage of £6,414.46. After checking various reports I am satisfied that
the error is made up of:

£3,489.69 — Transfers

£2,870 — Giro Deposits

£54.52 — unidentified (however due to all the coming and going with re-
keying entries, then this could come back as an error.

The Spmr claims that there was a Horizon software problem on 14.09.05
from 15.30 onwards. This was picked up when a member of staff noticed
that a transaction, which had been taken by another member of staff, had
not been entered onto the system, so therefore she put the transaction
through. She checked at the time with her colleague who said that she
thought she had put it through already however she accepted that she
could have made a mistake. Following on from that, it was picked up that
other giro business deposits that had been entered had not come up on the
system, so they were re-keyed.

There was also a problem with transfers from one stock to another, in that
they had doubled up. The Spmr made several telephone calls to the
NBSC, telling them about his problems and he was advised to carry on with
balancing and produce his Cash Account. Whilst doing this a warning
came up, however the NBSC told the staff to continue to roll over. The
result was that the office balanced £6,414.46 short.

The Spmr spoke to the Horizon Support Centre (ref E0509150123) who
investigated and agreed that there had been a navigation problem that had

now been rectified. They told the Spmr that they would report to NBSC that
they had identified and rectified the problem and that the amount could be
held in the suspense account. However, as part of the shortage relates to
transfers, and no error notice will be issued, then the Suspense Account
Team are not prepared to authorise the entry.

I telephoned The Suspense Account Team (Ann Wilde), who told me that
checks could be made with Girobank after next Wednesday, and if that
shows that duplications have been made, then they will authorise the
amount to be moved to the suspense account, until the office receives an
error notice. However, Ann stands by what she said about the transfer
problems, and that they would not move this amount to The Suspense
Account.

I went back to the Horizon Support Centre and spoke to a supervisor (Ken).
He said that the call had now been closed as the problem had been
rectified. I asked what was to happen about the resulting shortage and he
referred me back to NBSC, who they said would do various checks. I then
contacted NBSC, spoke to Rob Hughes and told him the story — he said he
would put a call through to Service Support. No follow up was received
from Service Support regarding this call.

28.09.05 - E mailed C&SM requesting that he look at the string of e mails,
hoping that he will be able to take it forward, as I don’t seem to be getting
anywhere.
