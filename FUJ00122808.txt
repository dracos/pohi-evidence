                        Jarnail,

Attached is a new Witness statement saying what I don't know about Falkirk and also
the comments on the 3rd report.

I 'doubt if they are of much use without getting the various detailed logs.

URGENT

David,

Thank you.              I would be grateful if Mr Jenkins is asked the following:-

1     In relation to the Eleanor Nixon statement, the information we
received that although Maureen Lyme states she cannot remember specific Offices she
has stated that pre August 2005 Offices were using a separate system for debit /
credit card transactions called Streamline. Offices would put debit / credit cards
through this system and produce a receipt, which could be keyed into the Hd"r=izon
                                                                                    FUJO0122808
                                                                                 FUJO0122808



terminals.

Some Postmaster / Clerks would key in the. information into Horizon as cash, instead of
debit / credit cards resulting in a shortage in Offices. If Post Offices contacted
Chesterfield at the time any Branch discrepancies were dealt with, and sorted out with
the individual Post Offices.

Therefore the problems were results of incorrect account produce and not a problem
with the Horizon system. No information is available for any Correction Notices pre
August 2005. So the Nixon statement is unlikely to have any relevance for our present
case of Misra.

2     The areas where Mr Jenkins says for POL to respond should be deleted
from his statement.

Mr Jenkins needs to comment on the third interim report received from the Defence
Expert.

The quality of training of SPMs is obviously outside Mr Jenkins expertise.
However I wonder if he might be. prepared to comment on how it might be possible to
examine the Horizon data to investigate mistakes.

We are keen that the Defence are given suggestions as to how they can efficiently test
their theories against the Horizon data. We do not want them to say that they will
not have time before the Trial. We anticipate that it would not be very difficult to
test their theories against a short but represented span of data example from the
months when Mrs Misra has admitted    false accounting. (15th November 2006 to 14th
                                   to




December 2006, 16th May 2007 to 16th June 2007, 14th November 2007 to 15th December
2007 and 9th January 2008. It would be helpful if Mr Jenkins could consider practical
and efficient ways in which the Defence might be able to test their theories.

I also refer you to my E-Mail to you of Friday 5th February 20.10 at 15.39 paragraphs
2, 3 and 4.

Thank you in anticipation of your help.

Kind regards.

Again without examining the logs it isn't possible to progress this.




Again what is being requested? I've not seen any logs and! don't believe that they have been
requested so how can this be progressed without them?
