contacted: By Kevin called back on Saqib computer.

Pm has lost all confidence in system and ki Barnes as he

feels she has misled him over previous calls.

call ref: e-0104091750.

the system seems to lose transaction and PM is concerned

jthat for every transaction that error he notices there is the
robability that there ones he misses, leading to

jdiscrepancies. The PM is at present finding the whole scenario very
tressful and is suffering sleepness nights due to these

oblems. In the light of what has gone on the PM is prepared

jto break his contractual obligations with POCL and refuse to

jpay any more discrepancies andwill take legal action if

required.

14/04/01 13:49 ukos1168

7/04/01 09:48 uk061537

contacted: I have left a message on Ki Barnes voice mail as the PM is
now complaining about her. I was speaking to her about the

last complaint call and we both feel that this PM is

omplaining unjustly. She has been in contact with him, and 1 feel
¢ is complaining because the feedback has been advising it

is user error, whereas the PM thinks it is software

7/04/01 10:12 uk061537

information: Ki is on holiday this week. I have spoken to Reg Barton in
er absence. The best way forward at present is for me to

rovide an update, although I feel the PM has had it already.

Ir will contact him today

17/04/01 10:17 wk061537

contacted: As I was on the phone to the PM, he advised that three
first class stamps that were on the screen just ‘dropped off".

PM had 3 first class stamps, and other stamps for 30p. When

the other stamps 30p went on, the first class stamps

(isappeared. They have since put the 3 first class stamps again.
the first transaction (that disappeared) was put on as 2@first
class stamp, and 1 normal first class stamp. The

transaction ID's are 1-221176-2 (for the 2 first class stamps)

FI97/1
17/04/01 10:40 wk061537
information: PM advises that the transactions taken after this one,
lstart 1-221178-, which basically skips out 1-221177-. We were
junable to find out the transaction ref of the 1 first class
jstemp that was taken with the 2 (ref 1-221176-2)

can SSC please invstigate why he has had disappearing
jtransactions again, and perhaps a recommendation as to what
jaction can be taken

JF) Response :

I now have pressing evidence to suggest that unwanted peripheral input is
curring, the likely source being the screen.

this has been seen at Old Iselworth (OI) and Wawne (W) with OI being the best
site; when the PM has been asked to leave the screen on overnight I have
bserved system activity corresponding to screen presses happening with no
jcorrepsonding evidence of either routine system activity or human
interference, the way forward now is to correlate this with the Microtouch
jsupplied monitoring software and to this ends Wendy is arranging for
installation of Kit at OI on friday, we can then, provided the PM agrees,
leave screens on over the weekend and record what happens.

nce these results have been analysed I feel sure that we will be ina
position to move forwards at OI. All other cases should be considered on
[their individual merits but you must appreciate that this is a fairly
intensive analytical activity and I cannot hope to provide answers on all
cases in the short term.
