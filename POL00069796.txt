Ce: Tom Beezer

Subject: £3,509.68 point week 49 P.O -v- Castleton

Attachments: LETTER_1113217.D0C; STATEMENT_1209662.DOC

Dear Richard,

I refer to our telephone conversation this morning and attach a further copy of our letter dated
18 January 2006 to Rowe Cohen dealing with the £3,500 point.

Please also see Liz Morgan's statement (copy attached) para 7 which succinctly sums up the
position:

7. If a subpostmaster transferred a shortfall into the Suspense Account, the shortfall would
still show in any balance snapshot printed after the transfer until after they balanced the
following week. This sometimes caused subpostmasters to at first mistakenly believe that
they had not transferred the shortfall from the Cash Account to the Suspense Account even
though they had.

Kind regards.
