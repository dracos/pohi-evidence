On more thought re the factual matrix section: we should remove point 67. It is too close to the matrix we contend

for at Point 67 of the Factual Matrix document.

Thanks

If Gideon thinks they’re problematic please leave them out. We’ve got a lot of good material and I don’t

want it undermined by taking points that don’t really work. What time tomorrow is this due to be served?
I’m in an arbitration hearing all day but I could look at any disputed bits over lunch (1pm to 2pm) if that

would help.

Thanks Andy. Agree with the approach. Nonetheless, I have highlighted a few of these which I think we
should not include - some of them seem a bit problematic to me. But subject to that, from my perspective
this is good to go.

All best

All

As per my discussion earlier today with Gideon, we have added more sections of the Judgment to the
attached statement. Our approach has been to include anything that we might rely on, unless plainly not
relevant to the application. The objective being to avoid any challenge on appeal that a point in the Judgment
was not put to Fraser on the application.

All comments welcomed.

Kind regards
Andy
