Thank you for your letter of 16 April to Jo Swinson MP, about the Initial Case Review
and Mediation Scheme. I am the Minister responsible for Post Office policy, while Jo
Swinson takes maternity leave.

The Government is supportive of the desire to resolve the issues raised by
Subpostmasters in a timely manner however, as shareholder, it cannot be involved in
operational matters concerning Post Office Ltd or the Working Group.

Clearly the matters you raise are important to you and I understand your desire for them
to be addressed but it is important that they are addressed by the appropriate parties.

Paula Vennells, as Chief Executive of Post Office Ltd is accountable to the Government
for operational matters and Lam also conscious that the Scheme, is }am-consciousthat-
verseen by the Working Group comprising representatives
from the Justice for Subpostmasters Alliance, Post Office Ltd, and Second Sight, has an
independent Chair in Sir Anthony Hooper._As a member of the Working Group I am sure

I have recently received a letter from Alan Bates, Chair of the Justice for Subpostmasters
Alliance (“JFSA”) regarding the Initial Case Review and Mediation Scheme, of which the
JFSA plays a role as a member of the Working Group, and of which you are independent
Chair.

The Government, as shareholder in Post Office Ltd, does not play a role in the operation
of the Working Group, and is keenly aware that you must be allowed to perform your
duties independently and free from influence.

The Government is supportive of the aim to resolve concerns of subpostmasters in a
timely manner and especilally those who have lodged applications with the
Scheme. i

In that spirit, Vai am forwarding ‘to you

correspondence from the JFSA that sets out their concerns about the operation of the
Scheme. This is provided without prejudice, and I have previously-informed the Mr_
BatesJFSA that I would be forwarding his letter to you to enable you to respond.sharing-
