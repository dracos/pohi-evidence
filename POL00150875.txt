Many thanks

Patrick

I have seen agents report dated 25" September 2008 send to me by Angela.

The report confirms that following Trial at Nottingham Crown court between 22™ and 25" September 2008 when he
was guilty by the Jury of 10 charges of theft. He was sentenced at Nottingham crown court on 27" October 2008 to 3
years and 3 months imprisonment concurrent(total) for all 10 changes.

I conform your above draft letter to the MP is factually correct, concise and to the point. Although I would emphasise
that he was convicted after a jury trial or convicted by the Jury.

Hope this helps.

Jarnail, Angela
Herewith the text of a draft reply to Mr Perkins, Mr Butoy’s MP.

Could I ask that you clear this please and, in particular, that the section detailing the charges brought against him, his
plea and the Court findings are correct ?

The MP’s letter says that Mr Butoy was convicted of 10 charges of ‘theft through false accounting’ which I don’t think
is the right wording.

Please reply all, so that Angela can review.

Hi Jarnail

You were, I think, going to retrieve the prosecution file for this one — any idea when we might expect it ?

Would you be happy to draft a response on this one. May need to know a bit more about the facts buit this could be a
good idea to set out some info about the scheme and perhaps send the factsheet.

Tom, did we send a holding response on this one?

Best wishes

A case handler is reviewing the rather large amount of paperwork CK has sent us to establish whether we
have sufficient information to investigate this case as BAU. That said my earlier view still stands that as this
appears to be an unsafe challenge we should respond to the MP with a letter setting out Post Office’s
position and the process that should be followed ie through the courts. Is Tom and/or Patrick best placed to
draft such a response.

Thanks,
Angela

Belinda,

If we still have the prosecution file we should be able to piece together what happened however is this is a
claim of an unsafe conviction which it appears to be from the MP’s letter then we should set out Post Office
POL00150875
POL00150875

position - no doubt there will be others that claim this.
Jarnail — would you obtain the prosecution file on this please.

Thanks,
Angela

Tom/Jarnail, copying you now ~ sorry for not doing so previously. Jarnail, Tom/Angela will need your assistance with
a response to this.

This is not a Scheme case and the applicant appears (according to the press reports — see link) to have been convicted
in 2008.
http://www. nottinghampost.com/Evidence-postmaster-overwhelming/story-12262177-detail/story.html

I am not sure whether we would actually be able to investigate this one afresh as I suspect very little information is
now held. I assume that Angela will want to review the file.

However, I think we should do a holding response to the MP while we get the file and consider this case.

Best wishes
