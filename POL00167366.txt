Subject: Matters affecting case closures and failings
Dear All

Just a reminder that you need to ensure that we are sent separate notifications
for both a case closure and the failings.

There have been a couple of instances whereby the failings have been included
on the closure document which has then been sent to

Secondary Stakeholders. We need to be mindful of the audience that receives the
failings as these are to identify improvements within

the business and not for sharing with the external customer.

Any problems please give me a call

Regards

Jane
