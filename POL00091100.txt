Subject: Miss Alison HALL - Hightown PO.

Sue.

I interviewed Miss Hall yesterday in her Solicitor's office in Cleckheaton. She denied theft but admitted False Accounting since Jan 2010.

She out the shortage down to the Lottery and the adjustments she had to make to bring the quantity of Lottery ticket on hand in line with what Horizon was saying.
Give me a call at your convenience and we can discuss in more detail

Regards,
