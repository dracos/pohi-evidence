IN THE CROYDON COUNTY COURT CLAIM NO.
BETWEEN:-
POST OFFICE COUNTERS LTD
Claimant
and
MRS JULIE WOLSTENHOLME
Defendant

PARTICULARS OF CLAIM

Post Office Counters Ltd ("POCL”) was until 25 March 2001 a wholly owned
subsidiary of the Post Office and is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Consignia plc.

Until her suspension on 30 November 2000 the Defendant was the subpostmistress
at Cleveleys modified sub post office under a written contract for services with the
Claimant. The Defendant's contract for services was subsequently terminated.

The Claimant lent to the Defendant the following items and equipment to assist her in
the performance of her duties as subpostmistress and the same were kept by her on
the premises:-

Two safes

Horizon computer equipment

Alarm system

Three mechanical scales and a parcel scale.
The value of the said items was at all material times estimated to be £11,100 in total.

Expressly or by implication the Defendant agreed that she would deliver up to the
Claimant and/or would permit the Claimant to collect the said items and equipment on
demand and/or on or after termination of the said contract and/or on or after cessation
or use of the said premises as a sub post office and/or within a reasonable time of
such demand or termination or cessation of use.

A sub post office has not been operated on the Cleveleys MSPO premises since
30 November 2000. On 23 February 2001 Elaine Tagg, a Retail Network Manager of
the Claimant visited the Cleveleys sub post office. The Defendant's business partner,
a Mr Roger Harrison, indicated that he would not allow the Horizon equipment or the

3

POL00118218
POL00118218
Safes to be removed from the sub post office as he said he was in dispute with the
Post Office. A letter was subsequently sent to Mrs Wolstenholme dated 12 March
200! requesting the delivery of the goods in question.

Arrangements were then made for the safes and other equipment to be removed on
30 March 2001 but on 29 March 2001 the Defendant said that entry to the premises
would be refused to POCL.

The Defendant has therefore refused to deliver up the safes and other equipment or
to permit the same to be collected and continues to do so and has wrongfully retained
and continues to retain the safes and equipment. In particular the Claimant requires
the safes for use at a new sub post office and if new safes have to be purchased the
cost is likely to be £18,800. The Claimant is therefore deprived of the use of the safes
and equipment and has suffered and continues to suffer loss and damage by reason
thereof.

The Claimant also claims interest pursuant to Section 69 of the County Courts Act
1984 on such sum as the Court may determine as payable for such time and at such
rate as may be just.

AND the Claimant claims:-

(i) delivery up of the said items and equipment or their value in damages
consequent upon the wrongful interference with the same by their detention,
alternatively damages in excess of £5,000

(ii) the said interest.

Statement of Truth

The Claimant believes that the facts stated in this the Particulars of Claim are true.

PARTICULARS OF DEFENCE AND COUNTERCLAIM

DEFENCE
1. Paragraph 1 of the Particulars of Claim is admitted.
2. In relation to paragraph 2 of the Particulars of Claim the Defendant admits that

she was a sub-post mistress but she contends that on its true construction the contract
between her and the Claimant was a contract of employment. The Defendant asserts
that her employment was terminated unlawfully and she has made an application to the
Industrial Tribunal for unfair dismissal and in that claim she has claimed re-engagement
and reinstatement at the premises in Cleveleys where she was carrying out her

employment, namely 2 Runnymede Avenue, Thornton-Cleveleys.

3. The Defendant admits that the items and equipment listed in paragraph 3 of the
Particulars of Claim were placed.in the said premises by the Claimant as part of her

contract of employment.

©
4. The Claimant is put to proof in respect of the value pleaded in paragraph 4 of the

Particulars of Claim.

5. Paragraph 5 of the Particulars of Claim is denied. In the alternative it is
necessary for the said items to remain in the said premises until the determination of the
disputes between the parties. It would be pointless for the said items and equipment to
be removed only to be reinstated in the event of a successful application by the

Defendant for reinstatement.

6. Paragraphs 6 and 7 of the Particulars of Claim are admitted. There is a

continuing dispute between the parties.

7. The contents of paragraph 8 of the Particulars of Claim are denied. The
Defendant has not wrongfully retained and refused to deliver up the said items as alleged

in paragraph 8 of the Particulars of Claim.

8. The Claimant is not entitled to the relief claimed in the prayer to the Particulars of

Claim or in paragraph 9 thereof.

9. If (which is denied) the Claimant is entitled to recover the claimed or any sum
from the Defendant, the Defendant will claim to set off damages recovered under her

Counterclaim in extinction or diminution thereof.

COUNTERCLAIM

10. The contents of the Defence are repeated.

11. The Defendant's contract of employment with the Claimant commenced in or
about November 1999. Her average take home pay for herself and co-employees was

£5,300 per month after deduction of National Insurance. The Defendant will refer at trial

+

POL00118218
POL00118218
to the full terms of the written contract entered into between ‘the parties and to the mode
of contro! exercised by the Claimant over the day to day control of the business carried
out from the said premises, including the promotion of products and the deduction of
National Insurance from her remuneration. On its true construction the said contract is a

contract of employment.

12. Further paragraph 1.9 of the written contract states that the Claimant may
terminate the contract at any time in case of breach of condition or non-performance of
obligations or non-provision of services or otherwise by giving three months notice in
writing and whilst by letter dated January 19th, 2001 the Claimant stated it was giving
three months notice the date specified in the letter did not give three months notice.
Given that the Claimant sought to give three months notice, the letter on its true
construction did not purport to terminate for breach of condition or non performance of

obligations or non provision of services.

13. In these circumstances the Claimant wrongfully and in breach of the said contract

terminated the Defendant's employment.

14. Further or in the alternative it was an implied term of the contract between the
Claimant and the Defendant that the computer system provided by the Claimant would be
fit for its purpose and the Claimant is in breach of this term in that the computer system
provided was unfit for its purpose and the Claimant failed to ensure that the system was
working adequately. The Defendant has supplied the Claimant with details of the

persistent inadequacies of the said computer system

15. Further the Claimant is a public authority for the purposes of section 6 of the
Human Rights Act 1998 and the Defendant's earned income under her contract of
employment or alternatively her goodwill constitute possessions for the purposes of the

Convention right to possessions under article 1 Protocol 1 and the Defendant is entitled to

is)

POL00118218
POL00118218
Co

damages under section 8 of the Human Rights Act 1998 by virtue of the Claimant's
actions in wrongfully terminating her contract. In addition the Defendant is entitled to

damages for breach of article 6 in that her mode of dismissal was unfair.

16. In the alternative if (which is denied) the Defendant was not employed under a
contract of employment she was a commercial agent for the purposes of the Commercial
Agents (Council Directive) Regulation 1993 made under section 2 (2) of the European
Communities Act 1982 and she is entitled to compensation and/or damages from the

Claimant pursuant to regulation 17(1) of the 1993 Regulations.

17. By reason of the above matters the Defendant has suffered loss and damage.
PARTICULARS

(1) Loss of the ingoing paid by the Defendant to the Claimant in the sum of

£82,500.00.

(2) Loss of earnings at £5,300 per month from November 22, 2009 to the date hereof

and continuing.

(3) Loss of the opportunity to earn income from related activities in the said

premises.
(4) Wages from 27/11/2000 to 22/04/2001 @ £5,300 per month equals £26,500.00.

And the Defendant counterclaims

(4) damages for wrongful dismissal;

(2) damages for breach of the implied term to provide a computer system fit for its

q

purpose;

POL00118218
POL00118218
POL00118218

A sub post office has not been operated on the Cleveleys MSPO premises since 30

ASSESSMENT

5. The assessment of the work done for the purpose of calculating the remuneration due for
any Post Office accounting period is undertaken in the following way.

6. The major measurable items of business undertaken at the sub office are assigned a
monetary value. Additionally, each Subpostmaster will receive a core payment, The total of
the business related and core payments reflects all of the work necessary to perform services
to the required standard as specified by Post Office Counters Ltd.

7. The payment for a particular item of business may be increased or decreased to reflect
changes in the method of performing the transaction. Details of the basis of the work related
payment appear at the appendix to this Section.

8. Additional items to which a monetary value has been assigned may be introduced from
time to time. Not all new items of business will attract a specific monetary value.

9. Where the numbers of transactions for a specific item of business which has been assigned a
distinct payment reduces, Post Office Counters Ltd may absorb the payment for that work
either into another item of business which has a distinct payment or into the core payment.

10. The monthly amount of remuneration to be paid in respect of the sub office is calculated by
multiplying the number of transactions against the respective monetary amounts, totalling
the results and adding to that sum one twelfth of the core payment. The total as derived has
been adjusted to take account of any work (or expenditure) undertaken outside those
transactions which have no specific payment.

11, The rate of payment is therefore in respect of the total provision of Post Office Couriter
services

i case of his sub-office he should initially make representations to his Retail Network

Es Manager. If he is dissatisfied with the outcome of such representations he may appeal to the

SECTION 3(M)

SUBPOSTMASTERS’ ABSENCE FROM OFFICE

GENERAL

“1. ASubpostmaster, under the terms of his cdntract, is not obliged to render personal service

and is therefore free to absent himself from the office, provided he makes suitable
arrangements for the conduct of the office during his absence.

2.  ASubpostmaster’s responsibility for the proper conduct of the office, or for any losses
occurring during his absence, is in no way diminished by his absence from the Sub-Office.
He must make proper provision, at his own expense, for the conduct of the office while he is
away, and must notify the Regional Manager on form P2593 when period of absence is
likely to be more than 3 days giving the name of the person substituting for him.

SECTION 4 (M)

NATIONAL INSURANCE

CLASSIFICATION

1.

For national insurance purposes, a Subpostmaster is regarded as an office holder with
emoluments chargeable to income tax under Schedule E. As such, all Subpostmasters are
liable to make national insurance contributions in accordance with the provisions of Class 1.
Class I contributions comprise 2 parts:

(a) _ the Primary contribution which is generally known as the employee's contribution

(b) _ the Secondary contribution which is generally known as the employer's contribution.

PERSONS TAKING UP AN APPOINTMENT AS A SUBPOSTMASTER

2.

All persons on taking up an appointment as a Subpostmaster should supply the Regional
General Manager with their national insurance number by means of a NI number card, form
P45 and/or P60 (see leaflet NI 217) and also any current certificate of Earner’s non/reduced
rate liability that they may have. Where for one reason or another a new Subpostmaster
does not provide a NI number, the action outlined in the Employer's Guide to National
Insurance Contributions (NP15) will be followed.

CONTRACTING OUT

3.

Under -the Social Security Act 1975, pensions for retirement, widowhood and invalidity
consist of 2 parts:

(a) _ basic pension

(b) anadditional pension related to an employee's reckonable earnings between the lower
earings limit and the upper earnings limit.

An employer may contract his employees out of that part of the State Scheme which.
provides an additional pension if the Occupational Pensions Board is satisfied that his
occupational pensions scheme meets the conditions required by the Act. As Subpostmasters
are not employees of Post Office Counters Ltd they are ineligible to belong to the Post Office
Staff Superannuation Scheme and therefore are not contracted out of the State Scheme.

CONTRIBUTIONS

5.

DSS leaflet NP15 "Employer's Guide to National Insurance Contributions" gives a guide to
the contribution arrangements.

©Copyright reserved Issue 2

Page 8
September 1994

(2%.
POL00118218
POL00118218

6. Provided earnings reach or exceed the lower earnings limit, a Subpostmaster will be liable to
pay Primary contributions on all earnings up to the upper earnings limit at:

(a) the standard rate; or
(b) the reduced rate (see para 7) or

(c) _ isnot liable for contributions because he/she is over pension age or has made other
arrangements (see para 14).

4
DSS has‘agreed that the amount paid to Subpostmasters in respect of their staff costs should
not be reckonable for the purpose of calculating NI contributions.

All Subpostmasters are required to submit details of their staff costs actually incurred. Staff

¢ costs should include not only assistants’ wages but also the employers National Insurance
contributions which these wages attract. Payments made for work carried out in any private
business should be excluded. Payments should also be excluded for those persons employed
in any private business but who are registered as a Sub Office Assistant because they
occasionally cover for short absences from the Post Office counter. If requested, all
Subpostmasters are required to provide details of other items of expenditure actually
ieumed in providing Post Office services.

Ya Subpostmaster trades for business purposes as a partnership with someone who assists
with the work of the Post Office, it is likely that under typical partnership arrangements
drawing are made rather than the payment of a wage or salary. In such cases, drawings that
can be fairly attributed to the contribution made in conducting Post Office business should
be treated as the staff costs incurred.

Details of staff costs should be recorded using forms SNI/1 and SNI/4 supplied by the
Regional Office. Form SNI/1 is used in those cases where Subpostmasters do not use a
wages book or other record of expenditure on staff costs, and should be retained at the Sub
Office for inspection by DSS or Post Office auditors. Details of monthly staff costs as set out
in the wages book or SNI/1 should be notified at the end of each month to the Regional
Office using form SNI/4.

If the weekly staff costs are constant (i.e. the same number of hours are worked each week in
the Post Office for the same pay), there is no necessity to submit subsequent forms SNI/4
after the initial retum purely because of a variation in costs arising for 4 weekly or 5 weekly

payments. Unless the Regional Office is advised accordingly, average monthly staff costs
will be calculated and carried forward each month.

MARRIED WOMEN AND WIDOWS

7. There is no longer a right to choose to pay reduced rate contributions. However, a woman
entitled to pay at the reduced rate for 1977-78 tax year continues to be able to do so for
subsequent years unless:
(a) she revokes her election;
(b) as amarried woman her marriage ends in divorce or annulment;

(c) she becomes a widow and after the initial period becomes entitled to widow's benefit;

(a) during 2 consecutive tax years which fall after 5 April 1978 she was neither liable to.
pay a Class 1 contribution nor was self-employed.

DSS will provide a certificate authorising deductions of a Class I contributor's contribution
at the reduced rate. As Post Office Counters Ltd will be held responsible for any deficiencies

©Copyright reserved Issue2
Page 9

Q I September 1994
i

POL00118218

POL00118218

in contribution, deductions will be made at the standard rate unless the Subpostmistress
produces a valid certificate.

NON LIABLE SUBPOSTMASTERS
8.  Nocontributions are payable by men over 65 or women over 60 and in such circumstances
DSS will normally issue a certificate of age exception. However, if some other definite
evidence is being held to show that a Subpostmaster has reached age 65 (60 for a woman)

his /her deductions may be ceased even though a certificate of age exception has not been
produced.

SECONDARY CONTRIBUTIONS

9. The Secondary contribution (see para 1) is due at the same rate regardless of the
Subpostmaster's rate of contribution.

ARREARS OF REMUNERATION

10. Any adjustment to the remuneration paid in an earlier month, will be treated as part of the
total remuneration in the month in which the payment is made, regardless of the period to
which they were proper. This applies whether or not the additional payments are made
regularly.

11. Where arrears of remuneration are due to a former Subpostmaster national insurance
contributions will be calculated from the weekly contributions table published by DSS.

DEATH OF SUBPOSTMASTERS

12. Contributions are not payable on any remuneration that might be due to a Subpostmaster's
estate after his death.

SICKNESS BENEFIT

13. ‘NI contributions continyg to be payable when a Subpostmaster who is sick continues to

receive his scale payment. NI sickness /industrial injury benefits received are not assessable
for any NI contribution.

SUBPOSTMASTERS WITH MORE THAN ONE EMPLOYMENT

14. Primary Class I contributions are payable in respect of each job, including other Sub Office
appointments, for which earings exceed the lower earnings limit, unless a current form
RD950 has been received from DSS. Even where a form RD950 is held, it is essential to.
collect Secondary Class I contributions.

SUBPOSTMASTERS SUSPENDED FROM OFFICE AND THEIR SUBSEQUENT REINSTATEMENT

15. Any payment withheld during suspension and subsequently paid upon reinstatement
should be treated as part of the total remuneration in the earnings period in which it is paid
regardless of the periods to which it relates. The NI contribution rate current at the time of
payment should be applied.

POL00118218
POL00118218

CHANGES IN NATIONAL INSURANCE STATUS

16. In the event of a change or impending change in national insurance status, a Subpostmaster
should consult his local DSS office as soon as possible.

17. The following.are regarded as changes in status:
(a) WOMEN:
Divorce 1
Annulment
Marriage
Widowhood
Re-marriage

In these circumstances the Subpostmaster must advise DSS and Post Office Counters
Ltd see para 7.

Retirement age Towards the beginning of the tax year in which a woman reaches
age 60 and again at the approach of the 60th birthday, a
Subpostmistress will be asked to consult DSS so that a certificate of
age exception may be issued if appropriate (see also para 8).
(b) MEN:
Retirement age At the approach of the 65th birthday the Subpostmaster will be asked

to consult DSS so that a certificate of age exception may be issued if necessary (see
also para 8).

DEFERMENT OF NORMAL RETIREMENT DATE

18. _Inall cases where a Subpostmaster seeks to enhance his retirement pension by a deferment
of NI retirement date (normally the 60th birthday for women, the 65th birthday for men) -
see DSS leaflet NI92 - or where he wishes to cancel his deferment, the Subpostmaster should.

be asked to consult his local DSS office so that the necessary arrangements can be made and
certificates of age exception obtained.

RESIGNATION/TERMINATION OF APPOINTMENT

19. Whena Subpostmaster resigns or has his contract terminated the Guaranteed Minimum
Pension will be preserved by DSS.

MARRIED WOMEN AND WIDOWS

20. There will be no Guaranteed Minimum Pension for a married woman or a widow who has
retained the right to pay the reduced rate of NI contribution.

CANCELLATION OF ELECTION TO PAY AT REDUCED RATE

21. When a married woman or widow revokes her election to pay NI contributions at the
reduced rate the Guaranteed Minimum Pension will accrue only on the contributions she
pays after revoking her election. -

SECTION 5(M)

I STATUTORY SICK PAY SCHEME
INTRODUCTION

1. Under the terms of the Social Security and Housing Benefits Act 1982 which came into force
on 6 April 1983, employers are responsible for statutory sick pay arrangements in respect of
their employees. An employee is interpreted as including office holders who receive
emoluments chargeable to income tax under Schedule E. Subpostmasters come within this
category and consequently Post Office Counters Ltd is obliged to comply with the
conditions of the Act.

2. The use of the words ‘employee’ and ‘employer’ are used in the context of this particular

piece of legislation and do not in any way alter the Subpostmaster's status as an
independent contractor.

GENERAL

3. Under the terms of the Scheme most Subpostmasters will not get State sickness benefit for
their first twenty eight weeks of sickness in each tax year. Instead they will get statutory sick
pay, known as SSP, from Post Office Counters Ltd.

EXCLUSIONS
4.  Subpostmasters will not get statutory sick pay if they come within one of the following
groups:
(a) Subpostmasters who have already had twenty eight weeks of SSP from Post Office
fi Counters Ltd ina tax year.

(b) Subpostmaster aged over 65 (over 60 for women).

i”

(c) I Subpostmasters who have received, and in some cases claimed sickness benefit,
invalidity benefit, maternity allowance or non-contributory invalidity pension 57 days
preceding the first day of the period of sickness.

(d) A Subpostmistress who goes sick during the time starting 11 weeks before the week in
which she is due to have a baby and ending six weeks after.

(e) I Subpostmasters who fall sick in a country outside the EEC.

(f) I Subpostmaster in legal custody.

POL00118218

I QUALIFYING DAYS

5. Statutory sick pay can only be paid for qualifying days. Qualifying days for Subpostmasters
will be those days on which they are normally required to provide services as detailed in
Section I of this contract. Where Subpostmasters are required to give services for only part of
the day, that day will count in full for statutory sick pay purposes. For the majority of
Subpostmasters there will be six qualifying days in each week (Monday to Saturday). Ifa
Subpostmaster is in doubt about which days are regarded as qualifying days he should seek

I confirmation from his Regional Manager. ,

6. Tobe entitled to statutory sick pay a Subpostmaster must be:

I . (a) _ sick for four days ina row; and
“) sick for at least three qualifying days; (these are called ‘waiting days’). Any qualifying
I day during a Subpostmaster's period of sickness can count as a waiting day.
Additionally any qualifying days in a four-day period of sickness which occur within
two weeks of another period of sickness of 4 days or more is reckonable.

Ifa Subpostmaster becomes incapable of work part way through a day, that day cannot
"4 count as a qualifying day unless he has not commenced work on that day.

NOTIFICATION OF SICKNESS

7.  ASubpostmaster or his representative must inform his Regional Manager by telephone of
his incapacity for work on or before his first working day of sickness irrespective of whether
he is entitled to statutory sick pay.

8. Those Subpostmasters, including those nominated by limited companies, who hold more
than one appointment, must notify the Regional Manager who collects National Insurance
: contributions.

9. Ifa Subpostmaster is late in giving notification of sickness, he should advise the Regional
Manager of the reason for the delay. If the Regional Manager is not satisfied with the reason
given for the delay, any period of sickness prior to the date of notification will not count for
the purposes of statutory sick pay. If a Subpostmaster is not satisfied with the Regional
Manager's decision on this matter he may apply to the Department of Social Security for a
ruling. If a Subpostmaster does not qualify for statutory sick pay, he will on notification of
r sickness be sent a form SSP1(E) by his Regional Manager.

EVIDENCE OF SICKNESS

10. Subpostmasters must provide Post Office Counters Ltd with evidence of incapacity for work
by means of either a doctor's medical certificate or by a self certificate if the incapacity is less
than eight days. A proforma to be used for self certification can be obtained from the
Regional Manager.

11. Subpostmasters must notify their Regional Manager when they cease to be sick.

END OF ENTITLEMENT TO STATUTORY SICK PAY

12. When a Subpostmaster has exhausted his entitlement to statutory sick pay he will be sent a
form SSPI(T), on which, if he is still sick, he can claim state sickness benefit from the ~
Department of Social Security.

RULES OF PAYMENT

©Copyright reserved Issue2

Page 13,
33 _—_
POL00118218
POL00118218

13. Inaccordance with the Act, Post Office Counters Ltd is obliged to abate any remuneration

. ‘ due by the appropriate amount of statutory sick pay. The effect of this will mean that for the
be first twenty eight weeks of sickness, remuneration will be paid in full and that statutory sick
t pay will be regarded as ‘notional’. Consequently although statutory sick pay will be
tegarded as ‘notional’ the total remuneration paid to the Subpostmaster will continue to
attract income tax and National Insurance contributions in full.

DUAL EMPLOYMENT

14. If aSubpostmaster who is sick is also employed either by the Post Office (e.g. as an
Auxiliary Postman) or another employer, and provided NI Contributions are paid
separately for each employment and all other conditions are met, he must claim statutory
sick pay in respect of both his Subpostmaster services and other employments.

OTHER INFORMATION

15. Other information about statutory sick pay can be obtained either from the Regional
Manager or from the local Department of Social Security offices.

ABSENCE FOR JURY SERVICE

1. ASubpostmaster who receives a summons to serve on a jury should notify his Regional
Manager immediately, and should inform him of the arrangements which he proposes to
make for the conduct of the work of the igubp-olfice in his absence.

2.  Subpostmasters attending for jury service should claim from the court any allowances for
which they are eligible in respect of travelling and subsistence and, where appropriate,
compensation for loss of remuneration. If a Subpostmaster is in need of advice as to the
allowances to which he will be entitled, he should seek it from the official responsible for the
issue of the summons.

carry out the work in his sub-office.

responsible for any failure, on the part of his Assistants, to apply Post Office rules, or to
‘provide a proper standard of service to the public. He will also be required to make good
any deficiency, of cash or stock which may result from his Assistants; actions.

ASSISTANTS’ CONDITIONS OF SERVICE

Assistants concerned. The Subpostmaster must submit an annual return giving the rates of
payment and the hours worked of all assistants in his employ.

provisions of any legislation which impose obligations on employers.

AGE

5. Asageneral guide no person under 16 years of age should be employed on Sub-Office
work, or have access to letter mails. Unless there is no reasonable alternative, the part-time
employment of an Assistant under 16 years of age should not be encouraged.

SUITABILITY OF APPLICANTS - REFERENCES

6. In the light of the Subpostmaster’s responsibilities, set out para 2 above, to avoid doubt he is
strongly recommended to satisfy himself of the character and suitability of an applicant for
employment as an Assistant before a firm offer of employment is made. Generally the
Subpostmaster should:

(a) _ obtain proof of the identity of an applicant, e.g. birth or marriage certificate, unless the
applicant is known personally;

(b) _ seek information from the application about any conviction or finding of guilt for any
offence in a Court of Law (including juvenile Court or Court Martial). In this
connection the Subpostmaster should be aware of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act
1974 which restricts the information that need be given;

(c) enquire whether the applicant has ever been employed by the Post Office and/or
other Subpostmaster. If the former then details of such employment should be

When seeking references the Subpostmaster is advised to enquire if the applicant had been
found to be completely trustworthy and ask the reason for his leaving that employment. In
some instances a Subpostmaster might have to employ a Assistant before the procedure
suggested above are completed. Bearing in mind the complexities of current employment
legislation a Subpostmaster in such a situation is recommended to offer initially only short
term employment pending receipt of satisfactory references etc.

The Subpostmaster must notify the Regional General Manager of his intention to employ a
new assistant on Post Office Counters Ltd work or when an assistant ceases to be employed
in the sub-office.

perform Post Office duties should signed in the Subpostmasters' presence in circumstances
which will help to fix the occasion and the declaration in the memory of the signatory. The
declaration should be made with proper deliberation and the Subpostmaster should stress
its importance and witness the signature. A signed and witnessed copy of the form should
be given to the signatory at the time and he should be advised to preserve it carefully.

on behalf of, the offender may be accepted but a receipt must be given showing that the
money is held pending possible investigation and without prejudice to any action that Post
Office Counters Ltd may be advised to take. The Subpostmaster should be careful not to
take any action which may be liable to prejudice the question of legal proceedings. A copy
of any receipt must be kept for reference.

UNSUITABLE PERSONS

12.

13.

Order to help prevent the employment of unsuitable dishonest persons on Post Office work,
a Subpostmaster shall notify the Regional Manager if he dismisses an employee on these
grounds, or if his enquiries about an application for employment give him reason to believe
that the applicant is an unsuitable person. Brief particulars of the evidence should be
forwarded to the Regional Manager who will decide what steps should be taken to prevent
the application employment elsewhere in the Post Office or at another sub-office.

Where Post Office Counters Ltd has good reason to believe that it would not be in its best
interests for a particular person to have access to Post Office Counters Ltd and stock as a
Sub-Office Assistant it may call upon the Subpostmaster to:-

(a) _ refrain from offering that person a post if not already employed;

QUALITY

GENERAL

1. The Subpostmaster will comply with all aspects of Post Office Counters Ltd quality
improved programmes and will ensure that his office operates to quality standards set from
time to time by Post Office Counters Ltd.

WAITING TIME

2. The Subpostmaster must make every endeavour to ensure that all customers start to be
served or within five minutes of the time when they join a queue to be served or within
such other time which shall, from time to time be prescribed. The normal standard is that
customers should expect to be served with this maximum time limit. The Subpostmaster
will in accordance with procedures advised by POCL, regularly monitor the waiting time
that customers experience in his office and will make all necessary adjustments to his
staffing patterns. Persistent failure to meet the standards of service will be regarded as a
breach of contract. Any failure by Post Office Counters Ltd to exercise this power should
not be regarded as a waiving of its rights under the terms of this contract.

TRANSACTIONS

3. I The Subpostmaster will be responsible for ensuring that transactions are carried out
accurately, that all reasonable steps are taken to prevent fraud and that all documentation is
properly completed and despatched at the due time. Where under the terms of its contracts
with its clients Post Office Counters Ltd incurs financial penalties as a result of the
Subpostmaster's failure in this regard. Post Office Counters Ltd will pass on this additional
cost to the Subpostmaster. However, the Subpostmaster will not normally be charged for
any penalties that result from errors made during the first three months of his appointment.
During the second three-months 50% of any penalty will-be passed on to the Subpostmaster.
The only exception is the loss of un-issued Motor Vehicle Licences where the full amount of
any loss must be met regardless of when the loss occurs. All penalties resulting from errors
made after the first six months will be passed on in full. Failure to properly complete
accounting and traffic information documents may lead to the exclusion in whole or in part
of business transacted for the purposes of determining payment.

4. The Subpostmaster will ensure that customers are treated fairly, courteously and helpfully.
Persistent failure to meet the high standard of service demanded by Post Office Counters
Ltd could result in termination of contract.

DIVULGENCE OF OFFICIAL INFORMATION

-1,_ The unauthorised disclosure, or use directly or indirectly, of any information or document
which has come to the knowledge of a Subpostmaster or Sub-Office Assistant through the
work of his Sub-Office is forbidden. Any such disclosure may render the offender liable to
prosecution under Post Office legislation or the Official Secrets Acts (see para 3).

2. Subpostmasters and their employees must not disclose any information regarding postal
packets passing through the post except to the person(s) to whom such packets are
addressed; nor may they make known information that may come to them officially
concerning the character, standing, or responsibility of individuals or firms, or the private
affairs of any person.

PERSONAL DECLARATIONS

3. (a) All Subpostmasters on taking up appointment and newly recruited Sub-Office
Assistants are required to sign a Personal Declaration (form P13) which reminds them
of the duty of the Post Office to ensure that all communications and items entrusted to
it reach the people for whom they are intended promptly and safely, and that the
information in them reaches no one not entitled to it. The Personal Declaration also
brings to the notice of newly appointed Subpostmasters and Sub-Office Assistants on
taking up employment their obligations under the Official Secrets Acts and various
Post Office and Telegraph Acts. Extracts from these Acts are reproduced at
Appendices 1 and 3. A copy of form P13 is at Appendix 2.

(b) A Subpostmaster on termination of his appointment is required to sign a Declaration
(P301) as a reminder that the provisions of the Official Secrets Acts continue to apply
to him after he has left in respect of all the information which he has acquired or to
which he has had access by virtue of his appointed position as Subpostmaster. A copy
of form P301 is at Appendix 3.

(c) I Subpostmasters and Sub-Office Assistants are given a copy of their P13 and
Subpostmasters, on termination of their appointment, additionally of form P301 for
retention as a reminder of their importance and of the message they contain. The duty
not to disclose information is imposed by the relevant Acts, not by the Personal
Declarations. Consequently no Subpostmaster or Sub-Office Assistant can avoid these
legal obligations by refusing to sign form P13 (also for Subpostmasters form P301) or
attempting to revoke or disclaim his signature on the form(s).

4. Any request made by the Police, or any other authority or by a private person for
information which may be confidential, or may concern matters connected with the duties
of another Subpostmaster or a Post Office employee, or with regard to the address of a
person who resides, or has resided, in the neighbourhood should be referred immediately to

the Regional Manager.

Subpostmasters must ensure, when communicating with the press or offering comment
which may be broadcast on radio or television, that their comments do not go beyond the
accepted bounds of propriety and are not likely to cause embarrassment or to mislead the
public. The Regional Manager should be asked to advise in cases of doubt.

Sub-Office personnel in relation to material which is published in the news media. The
Public Relations Department of the Post Office is primarily responsible for deciding whether
the Post Office should enter into public correspondence and for ensuring fair and accurate
presentation of facts about the Post Office and its services; comment by other persons is
undesirable and in particular, untrue, ill-informed or reckless comment will not be allowed
to go unchallenged. While recognising the right of any individual to comment publicly on
matters of general interest, therefore, the Post Office expects Subpostmasters and their
employees who wish to comment upon matters affecting the Post Office, to exercise this
right in a responsible manner.

6. A Subpostmaster wishing to communicate with the public news media should be guided by
the following:

(a) _ there must be no unauthorised disclosure of official information (see para 1);

(b) views and opinions expressed publicly must not bring the Post Office or its employees
or any other Subpostmaster into disrepute;

(c) a Subpostmaster offering unauthorised public comment must make it clear that he is
commenting in his private capacity and not on behalf of the Post Office.

7. Particular care is necessary when offering spontaneous comment to press or broadcasting
reporters or interviewees.

information derived from official records or experience for the purpose of publishing any
document, book, play or article, broadcasting on radio or television, producing or exhibiting
a film or photographs, giving a talk or lecture or taking part in a public discussion.

CORRESPONDENCE WITH THE PUBLIC
9. A Subpostmaster should‘fiot, without the permission of the Regional General Manager,

write to or interview members of the public on Post Office matters other than for the
purpose of correcting an error committed at his own Sub-Office.

OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

10. NoSubpostmaster may, without permission, make an official document or a letter from the
public, or any other document which may come into his hands officially, the subject of legal

proceedings.

while the access continues, but also after it ceases, e.g. by termination of employment.

SECTION 14 (M)

NON-OBSERVANCE OF RULES: APPEALS PROCEDURES

ALLEGATIONS OF NON-COMPLIANCE OR NON-OBSERVANCE OF RULES

1

Except in cases in which civil or criminal proceedings are contemplated and without
prejudice to any subsequent proceedings, the Subpostmaster will be afforded an
opportunity of giving a written explanation of any allegation of non-compliance or
non-observance of the rules which may have been made against him.

The Subpostmaster may at the discretion of the Regional General Manager, if the
Subpostmaster wishes to do so, discuss the allegations with the Regional General Manager
and may be accompanied by a friend while doing so.

Repeated breaches of the rules, even if minor in themselves, may lead to the determination
of the contract, and a record will be kept by the Retail Network Manager of any written
warnings issued to the Subpostmaster.

REPRESENTATIONS ON POST OFFICE MATTERS

4.

ASubpostmaster should address to the Regional Office any representation he may wish to
make having reference to his duties, pay or any other Post Office matter.

APPEALS

5.

Regional Manager whose decision shall be final except in the case of an appeal about
remuneration (see para 15 of Section 2).

APPROACHES TO PERSONS OUTSIDE THE POST OFFICE

6.

Until the Subpostmaster has exercised his final right of appeal, he should not ask persons
outside the Post Office to take up the case on his behalf although this does not prevent a
Subpostmaster from obtaining advice from an outside person. The Subpostmaster should
not detain Post Office papers or allow them out of his custody for the purpose of such
consultation without the permission of the Regional Manager.

SECTION 15 (M)

OFFENCES: SUSPENSION: ENQUIRIES BY OFFICERS OF THE INVESTIGATION DIVISION.

Dishonesty is viewed most seriously and any Subpostmaster or Sub-Office Assistant guilty
of, or taking part in an act of dishonesty against Post Office Counters Ltd may be
prosecuted. Furthermore, any Subpostmaster so involved renders himself liable to summary
termination of his contract and, in the case of an Assistant, Post Office Counters Ltd may
recommend to the Subpostmaster that. the assistant should no longer remain in his employ
on Post Office Counters business.

ARRESTS AND CONVICTIONS

2.

A Subpostmaster must report to his Retail Network Manager if he is arrested and refused
bail, or if he is convicted by a Court of any criminal offence (except a traffic offence for
which the penalty has not included imprisonment).

IMMORALITY AND OTHER MATTERS OF PERSONAL CONDUCT

3.

It is the aim and practice of Post Office Counters Ltd to maintain, to the maximum extent
compatible with needs of the public service, an attitude of non-interference in the private
lives of Subpostmasters. However, where facts come to light calculated to cause public
scandal or grave embarrassment to the Post Office in connection with a Subpostmaster's
private conduct, the question of his fitness for retention in office may have to be considered.

SUSPENSION FROM OFFICE

4,

‘A Subpostmaster may be suspended from office at anytime if that course is considered
desirable in the interest of Post Office Counters Ltd in consequence of his being arrested, or
having civil or criminal proceedings brought or made against him, or where irregularities or
misconduct at the office(s) where he holds appointment(s) have been established to the
satisfaction of Post Office Counters Ltd, or admitted, or are suspected and are being
investigated. In such cases the Retail Network Manager may require the Subpostmaster to
make his premises available at a mutually agreed rate of payment, for the continued
provision of Post Office services.

Where a Subpostmaster is suspended his remuneration in respect of any period of
suspension will be withheld so long as such suspension continues.

On the termination of the period of suspension whether by termination of contract or
reinstatement, the Subpostmaster's remuneration in respect of that period may, after
consideration of the whole of the circumstances of the case, be forfeited wholly or in part. If
remuneration is paid it will be less any rent or other expenses which may have been paid to
him in respect of the continued use of his premises for Post Office purposes during the
period of suspension.

CRIMINAL CONDUCT: REPORTING

7.  IfaSubpostmaster has knowledge or suspicion of dishonesty or other criminal conduct
affecting the Post Office on the part of any person including a Sub-Office Assistant or a Post
Office employee he must, if there is any apparent need for immediate action, at once tell the
Retail Network Manager confidentially of his knowledge or suspicion.

©Copyright reserved Issue 2

Page 43

63 —
POL00118218
POL00118218

8. Ifany person should try to induce a Subpostmaster or a member of his staff to act contrary
to the rules (if, for example, he should be asked to datestamp covers irregularly with a view
to either himself or the offender afterwards enclosing therein betting slips or other ~
communications relating to the result of some race, game or sport) he should, while
avoiding compliance (save in the case described in para 9), also avoid putting that
upon his guard by definite refusal. The Subpostmaster should as soon as possible tell the
Retail Network Manager what has happened giving a full report and description of the
person so that an immediate report can be made to POID and instruction sought.

9.  ASubpostmaster or Sub-Office Assistant who is asked irregularly to put in course of post
for despatch or delivery from his own office a cover already date-stamped, addressed to a
betting agent, and presumably already containing a betting slip or other communication
respecting the result of some race, game or sport, should accept it and with it any bribe
offered for compliance. He should at once initial the cover and hand it and the bribe to the
Retail Network Manager, to whom he should report as provided in the last sentence of para
8.

THEFTS BY STRANGERS

10. I ASubpostmaster or Sub-Office Assistant who sees a theft of Post Office property
committed by a stranger should inform the Police of the facts and then report the matter to
his Retail Network Manager as soon as possible.

FAILURE TO REPORT DISHONESTY

11. Inline with any employee of the Post Office a Subpostmaster or Sub-Office Assistant is
expected to report immediately any suspicion of dishonesty or criminal intent which may in
any way affect the Post Office, whether the likely offender be connected with the Post Office
ornot. They are similarly enjoined to render alll possible assistance to officers of the
Investigation Division (see below).

ENQUIRIES BY OFFICERS OF THE INVESTIGATION DIVISION

12. The main job of the Investigation Division is to investigate, or to help the Police to
investigate, criminal offences against the Post Office, British Telecommunications and the
Department for National Savings. The Investigation Division does NOT enquire into matters
where crime is not suspected.

13 Most of the crimes dealt with by the Investigation Division are committed by outsiders. It
follows that a common reason for Investigation Division officers seeking interviews with
‘ persons engaged on Post Office business is to get help in clearing up such offences. Usually
the help takes the form of a witness statement that provides evidence about a particular act
or acts that the witness has carried out in the course of his or her duty.

14 Although they comprise the minority of all Investigation Division crime investigations,
there are many cases where the possibility (or every direct suspicion) arises that persons
employed on Post Office business may be involved. Officers of the Investigation Division
conduct interviews about these suspected offences and they are required to observe the
same code of conduct when obtaining evidence as that laid down for police officers. This
provides for an officer investigating a criminal offence to question any person, whether
suspected or not, from whom he thinks that useful information may be obtained. As soon as
the Investigation Division officer has evidence which would afford reasonable grounds for
suspecting that a person has committed an offence, he must caution him before asking any
questions about that offence. The caution must be in terms which make it clear that the
suspected person is not obliged to say anything unless he wishes to do so and that what he
says may be put into writing and given in evidence.

POL00118218
POL00118218

Atall interviews between ID officers and a Subpostmaster or Sub-Office Assistant, the
interviewing officer will first introduce himself, explain the nature of the enquiry. then ask
the people the to interviewed if he wished to have a friend present. The introduction and
explanation are necessary first steps so that the person to be interviewed knows what is
involved when he makes his free Personal choice whether or not to ask for a friend to be
present at the interview or not.

A friend invited to attend an Investigation Division interview must be aged 18 or over and
cannot be someone involved in the enquiry. The friend must be a Subpostmaster, Sub-
Office Assistant or Post Office employee. To avoid unreasonable delay and to ensure that
interviews will not commence until a friend, if requested, is present, the person being
interviewed will be asked to nominate alternative friends if the one first (or subsequently)
chosen is not available or may be involved in the enquiry.

If a person being interviewed declines to have a friend present when asked but changes his
mind later, he may ask for a friend to be called at that stage. If he is not questioned as a
‘suspected person at the outset (i.e. not under caution), but fresh evidence emerges during
the interview which gives reasonable grounds for suspicion, the Investigation Division
officer will make this clear and explain that he proposes to continue his questions after
caition. Before the caution is given the Investigation Division officer will ask if the presence
of a friend is desired during the remainder of the interview.

A friend may only attend and listen to the questions and answers. He'must not interrupt in
any way, either by word or signal; if he does interrupt he will be required to leave at once
and the interview will proceed without him. Whatever is said at the interview is to be
treated as in strictest confidence. The friend may take notes of the interview but he must
keep the notes in the strictest confidence. The only communication the friend is entitled to
make on behalf of the person who has been questioned will be in the form of a written "in
strictest confidence" statement which may be submitted by the latter, in support of any
official appeal which the person questioned may desire to make in connection with the
methods followed at the enquiry. No other communication about the interview is allowed
(unless made by permission of the Post Office) as it might constitute a breach of the Official
Secrets Acts.

SEARCHES

20.

21.

Ifa person agrees to his property or house being searched by ID staff the ID officer will ask,
before the search is carried out, if he wishes to have a friend present.

1D officers have no authority to search a Subpostmaster or Sub-Office Assistant or their
homes unless they have first obtained the agreement of the person concerned or they have
obtained a warrant to do so. In practice ID officers only seek authority or permission to
search when it is deemed absolutely necessary or in the interests of the person involved (e.g.
as a pointer to their innocence). If search by consent is carried out during the course of
enquiries which do not substantiate any suspicion that may have been directed at a
Subpostmaster or Sub-Office Assistant, he will be handed at a later stage a written apology
for any inconvenience caused, coupled with a statement that he readily agreed to the search
and that nothing which would cast any doubt on his honesty was found.

SECTION 16 (M)

INFECTIOUS (INCLUDING CONTAGIOUS) DISEASES

1. Subpostmasters, are expected to act on the advice given by their general practitioners or
hospital specialists, and to refrain from providing “Personal Service”, by taking leave of
absence, through sickness if advised to do so. This is both for their own good and that of
others.

2. Contact with a persori suffering from such a disease will only rarely exempt a
Subpostmaster from providing Post Office services, nevertheless the advice in Par. 1 may
apply if the medical practitioner so advises.

3. “Open cases” of Pulmonary tuberculosis must receive clearance from the Post Office, before
a Subpostmaster will be allowed to resume the provision of “Personal Service”.

4. Ifthe local Public Health Department should require the temporary closing of the office, the
Regional General Manager will issue instructions as to the stock, etc. In such cases the
question of continuing payment of the Subpostmaster’s emoluments subject to a deduction
in respect of any saving in expenses, will be considered on its merits.

5. These conditions apply equally to any assistants employed by a subpostmaster on Post
Office duties. Also, in such cases the question of meeting any loss sustained by the
Subpostmaster or Sub-Office Assistant in consequence of the latters enforced absence will be
considered on its merits. It should, however, be understood that the object of any payment
that may be made by Post Office Counters Ltd in these cases is to prevent there being any
inducement to the sub-office Assistant to come on duty when his presence would be a
source of danger to the public or the Post Office employees with whom they might come in
contact in his Post Office work. Post Office Counter recognises no other obligation in the
matter.

INTRODUCTION

1

The actual hours of opening at any individual sub-office are set by the Regional Manager in
accordance with the following rules.

The hours of opening may be altered with the prior permission of the Regional Manager at
any time, provided that the new hours are not less than the hours of counter service at para

STANDARD COUNTER HOURS OF SERVICE

4.

The minimum standard hours of opening during which the Subpostmaster may be required
to open his office in order to transact all kinds of counter business appropriate to his office
are set out in Section 1

However, where a Subpostmaster's private Business is open for longer periods, the Regional

SECTION 19 (M)

INTRODUCTORY PAYMENT

On the opening of a sub office to be run on the terms of the modified contract a successful
applicant will be required, as recognition of the opportunity to run a Post office on behalf of Post
Office Counters Ltd, to make an introductory payment. Such payments will be liable for VAT and
will be non-returnable.

In the event of Post Office Counters Ltd deciding to close or resite the office, other than at a time of
summary termination or resignation by the Subpostmaster in order to avoid summary
termination, a compensatory payment will be made to the outgoing Subpostmaster, which will be
calculated on the same basis as the introductory payments, but on the level of remuneration at the
time of closure or resiting.

FORMER EMPLOYEES OF POST OFFICE COUNTERS LID

On the opening of a sub office to be run on the terms of the modified contract by a former member
of Post Office Counters Ltd staff who worked either in the regarded office, or in an office within
the same unit as the regarded of office where surpluses could not be cleared without voluntary
redundancy, no payment will be required by the successful applicant as recognition of the
opportunity to run a post office on behalf of Post Office Counters Ltd. However on ceasing to hold
the appointment as the subpostmaster, the former member of staff will be required to make a
payment to POCL which will be based on his remuneration at the time of appointment plus the
increase in the Retail Price Index since that date. Such payment will be liable for VAT and will be
non returnable

MRS JULIE WOLSTENHOLME

Defendant

REPLY AND DEFENCE TO COUNTERCLAIM

1 As to paragraph 2:

1.1 The Claimant avers the Defendant was in law an agent of the Claimant and not an

employee;

1.2 It is admitted that the Defendant has brought proceedings in the Manchester

Employment Tribunal. It is submitted those proceedings are misconceived.

2 As to paragraphs 3, 5 and 6:
2.1 The said items admitted under paragraph 3 were placed with the Defendant

pursuant to the contract of agency and not on account of any employment

relationship between the parties;

2.2 In any event, even if there existed an employment relationship (which is denied) the
Claimant would have no lawful reason or authority for holding on to and refusing to
deliver up, the goods of the Claimant, such that by her refusal and on her own case,
she has committed the torts of conversion and/or trespass to goods and further has

acted contrary to the agreement to return the goods on the termination of the said

agency agreement;

2.3 The Employment Tribunal’s jurisdiction in respect of reinstatement is entirely

dependent on:

2.3.1 The Defendant succeeding in her contention that she was an employee, against
which there is settled and long standing judicial authority in favour of the

Claimant’s contention;

2.3.2. The Employment Tribunal exercising its unfettered but rarely exercised
discretion to grant an order for reinstatement pursuant to s.113 (a) and s.114 of

the Employment Rights Act 1996.

2.4 In the premises the averments made under paragraphs 5 and 6 are bad in law and
there is no justification for the Defendant’s refusal to return the said goods to the

Claimant.

3.1 The Defendant well knew and accepted that the Claimant had given lawful and
proper notice of termination of the said agreement and offered a payment in lieu of

the 3 month notice the Defendant was entitled to under the written agreement;

3.2 The said sum was calculated from the date of suspension of the Defendant

(30/11/00) with the last date of service identified as 28/2/01;

3.3 The Defendant normally would have received £19,322.85 in commission for this
period. Due to the fact that there were outstanding losses incurred by the Defendant
(£17,825.37) and for which she was liable to make good to the Claimant, the
Claimant paid the balance or excess of commission or remuneration to the

Defendant in the sum of £1,497.48.

4 It is denied that the said computer system was unfit for its purpose and it is averred the

same worked adequately.
5 Asto the claim under the Human Rights Act:

5.1 No admission is made as to whether the Claimant is a public authority within the

meaning of s.6 of the Act;

5.2 It is denied that the Defendant’s earned income or goodwill from the said agency

constitute possessions within the meaning of Article 1 of the First Protocol;

aQ
5.3 Insofar as there has been an interference with the possessions of the Defendant
(which is denied) the same does not amount to a breach of the Act and/or is justified
as being in the public or general interest and was subject to the conditions provided

for by law;
5.4 Itis denied that the Defendant is entitled to any award under s.8 of the Act;

5.5 It is denied that the Defendant has suffered any interference with her article 6 right

and/or any act or omission of the Claimant was in breach of article 6.
As to the claim under the 1993 Regulations:

6.1 The Defendant is put to strict proof of her contention that the regulations applied to

the relationship between the parties;
6.2 Insofar as it is held the regulations apply:

6.2.1 The said agreement satisfied the provisions of regulation 15(1) and (2), in that
3 months notice was provided to the Defendant in respect of the termination of

the said agreement;

6.2.2 The Defendant has received all she is entitled to under regulation 17 by virtue

of the payment made as set out under paragraph 3.3 above;

6.2.3 The pleading is defective in that it fails to identify which measure of
compensation is being sought under regulation 17 in respect of the termination
of the said agreement and/or identify recompensable loss under the said

regulation.

Dear Sir.

1 am experiencing difficulties with Weightman Vizards (Post- Office Counters Ltd Solicitors). I feel that
they seem to be taking advantage of the fact that I am a layperson, and I am trying my best to comply,
but they seem to be going round in circles. They have still not appointed a computer expert saying he
would need to see copies of both parties List of Documents. I sent my List of Documents on 02/05/03
and up to date 1 have not received their fist.

All I want to do is settle this case as soon as possible but they seem to keep moving the goalposts.
Three times now I have requested the Computer Call Logs from June to November 2000 but now they
say that their client does not have copies of these. This is vital evidence needed for my counterclaim.

Unfortunately when I sent out my amended Defence and Counterclaim I had not noticed that the

paragraphs of the claimants amended particulars had changed. I therefore enclose a re- amended
copy of my defence.
