POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY

FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF RODERICK MARK ISMAY

|, Roderick Mark Ismay will say as follows:

Introduction

1. | understand that the purpose of this witness statement is to set out matters

of fact of which | have personal knowledge.

2. This witness statement was drafted in my own words with my solicitor’s
assistance during a process including the preparation of successive drafts
after communications between me and those advisers in writing, by

telephone and by video conference.

3. The facts within this witness statement are either within my own knowledge,
or derive from the records provided by the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry.
However, as it relates to events that occurred in some cases up to nineteen
years ago, there are several areas that | do not recall. Where that is the

case, | have said so.

4. This statement responds to the request for a written witness statement

Page 1 of 24
WITNO04630100
WITN04630100

pursuant to Rule 9 of the Inquiry Rules 2006 reference WITN0O463R9
(1)/LD/20221007 dated 7 October 2022. My witness statement responds to
the questions asked in Appendix 1 regarding the Post Office Horizon

computer project.

Professional Background

5. | joined Post Office Ltd in September 2003 as Head of Risk and Control, in
the Finance Directorate, having previously worked for Ernst & Young. |
consider myself to be a finance professional, with a background in audit and
accounting and positive experience of board reporting, staff engagement

and process improvement.

6. The role began with just two internal control managers, but evolved to take

on responsibility for the branch audit team

7. Initially, a large part of my time was involved in researching financial
services regulatory compliance requirements. Post Office Ltd was
developing a relationship with the Bank of Ireland to transform the range of
financial services products available in branches and | was asked to be
involved. My work led to clarification of Post Office Ltd’s position as an
appointed representative of the Bank of Ireland and to the initiation of further

compliance workstreams.

8. | also oversaw the Anti-Money Laundering Team. This further dimension of
compliance meant my role involved much cross business liaison and
reporting, leading to the development of a Compliance Committee for Post

Office Ltd.

WITNO04630100
WITN04630100

My role also evolved to include the Investigations Team and to involve more

working with the cash logistics team.

Network cash holdings were at such a level as to exacerbate working capital
and security risks. | therefore became involved in a significant engagement
project with supply chain and network teams to improve the targetry for
individual branch cash holdings and to work with subpostmasters and
branch managers to reassure them that their branches could serve

customers reliably with lower cash holdings.

Several high value branch losses arose in this period. This type of matter
would be followed up by Investigations, which had become part of my team.
This led to further evolution of the role in prevention and compliance —
focusing in particular on cash holdings and on cheque holding and dispatch.
At the same time, my role developed more dialogue with the Product &
Branch Accounting Team (P&BA). POL was preparing to deploy new central
finance systems for accounting and for management information. This
involved many workstreams with all areas of Finance including P&BA and

took an increasing amount of my time.

As Post Office Ltd evolved and as teams changed, my work above led to a
natural progression towards the P&BA team. | was asked to take over the
role of Head of Product & Branch Accounting in June 2006, ceasing my

previous role.

This role in P&BA evolved with various priorities in different years. These
included major projects such as procurement tenders and consequent

migration to new suppliers for cheque processing and card processing,

Page 3 of 24
14.

15.

16.

WITNO04630100
WITN04630100

support for the deployment of new products for customers, entry into
telephony, engagement in the cessation of products and continuous

improvement of back office processes and support for branches.

Throughout all these changes and projects, my role and P&BA’s role
continued to have a keen focus on working collaboratively with teams across
the organization to make it as easy as possible for transaction processing
in branches and for the subsequent central processing, reporting and
settlement with clients. By clients | mean third party organisations such as
banks and government agencies who were owed money by, or owed money

to, POL as a result of transactions with customers.

| prioritised constructive relationships with other teams in POL, with the
NFSP, with CWU, with Multiple Partners and with clients and suppliers and
promoted a culture of such relationships amongst Team Leaders in P&BA.
We received positive feedback from such organisations, including about
collaborative working, tone of voice and commitment to continuous
improvement. This included many site visits and floor walks with such

partners.

The whole Finance function underwent structural change over time, with
several roles related to financial and management accounting moving from
London to Chesterfield. Preparation for Royal Mail privatisation, and
separation of Post Office Ltd, necessitated further changes such as creating
an Accounts Payable team in POL. My role consequently evolved to recruit
into and take responsibility for such new functions in Chesterfield. In doing

so, the broader responsibilities for my team and myself led to P&BA

Page 4 of 24
WITNO04630100
WITN04630100

becoming the Finance Service Centre. This was central to my role evolution

from 2012 to 2016.

17. left Post Office Ltd in March 2016.

18. My qualification for the roles was as a Chartered Accountant

Training

19. | did not design the training delivered to subpostmasters. Members of my
team would, however, have had input where business changes were being
initiated which would impact on P&BA as well as on branches. | may also
have been included as a reviewer on some of these. | felt that adequate
training was very important in the function of the Horizon system and that
this should be backed up by central support teams which colleagues in
branches should feel comfortable to call if in doubt. | had no reason to
believe that the training was not adequate. It is highly likely that the Post
Office would have received feedback about training from Subpostmasters
and | expect that this would have been addressed in the training where

appropriate.

20. Document NFSP00000521 (National Federation of Subpostmasters: Report
of a meeting of the NEC ) refers to a crib sheet to assist in disputing
Transaction Corrections. | cannot recall this crib sheet, nor why it would
have been felt that such an addition was needed, over and above what

guidance and support may already have been available at the time.

Advice and Assistance

21. |The NBSC was a very important source of advice and assistance. | cannot

Page 5 of 24
WITNO04630100
WITN04630100

remember how it evolved over time.

22. Based on the quoted document, POL00029732 (internal emails re
Subpostmaster concerns), and the file issue raised that day, | do agree
something needed to change at that time. In this incident it appeared there
had been file duplication and omission. They needed to be sent on time and

once only.

23. Document POL00039228 (Branch Support Programme DRAID log)
appears to be a programme action log covering a wide range of topics
including training, compliance, customer complaints, new products,
communications and project administration. The breadth of topics and
number of actions suggests a strong commitment to advice and assistance,
but with such a wide network, a wide product set and multiple programmes
ongoing at any one time, | do not feel able to comment on the adequacy of

advice and assistance based on this very detailed log.

Function of Horizon

24. The Ping Project was established to help sub-postmasters and to prevent
the need for such large resource dedicated to administering the related
errors in P&BA. | was an advocate for this project and believed it had clear

benefits for branches and also for back office teams.

25. As FUJ00091215 (Interfacing Client Data into POL Systems) and
FUJ00091234 (Ping Project Requirements Catalogue) set out, Ping related
to standalone product terminals and had an initial focus on Camelot. It was
intended to reduce the number of differences by eliminating the need for
manual input. Without Ping, branches had to get a report from the Camelot

Page 6 of 24
26.

27.

28.

WITNO04630100
WITN04630100

terminal and then key specific data from it into Horizon. In practice there
were a lot of conformance errors including confusion about which data,

which time period and also not entering the data at all.

The Camelot terminal was the prime source of transactional data. This was
the device where the customer had been served, it was the source of data
sent to Camelot and the source of the same data for branches to enter into

Horizon.

Ping proposed to make the process easier by sending a Transaction
Acceptance to the branch, based on the Camelot data, and prompting the
branch to run a receipt from the Camelot terminal which would enable them
to assure themselves that the data in the TA was correct and consistent with
their own in branch Camelot terminal. Given that many branches had been
unsure how to generate the data before and how to record it, this new

opportunity seemed to be a very positive step to help branches

My teams primarily worked using a central SAP finance system, not Horizon,
and so we would not have had direct user experience to inform views on
Horizon except in so far as transaction corrections suggested opportunities
for improvement at the counter, or to the limited extent that we actually
worked in branch to help at Christmas or during strikes. Based on document
FUJ00097480 (HNG-x Release 2 Implementation Plan), the ability to deploy
“Ping” and the list of other changes appeared to be dependent on the
progress of the Horizon releases. With the passage of time, however, | am
afraid | cannot remember what | thought, nor what my level of awareness

would have been, about Horizon Online and HNG-X Release 2 and how the

31.

32.

33.

34.

WITNO04630100
WITN04630100

release functioned, other than that it would have enabled progress on Ping.

Regarding POL00029370 (Review of the Creation and Management of
Transaction Corrections in POLFD to Correct Accounting Errors in Horizon),
P&BA refers to Product & Branch Accounting which was my team at the

time.

Transactions Corrections at the time were identified either from matching

processes or from queries raised.

Matching processes were in place where there were two streams of data
originating from the same transaction. One stream would be the Horizon file
sent to the POLFS system in P&BA. The other stream might be a data file
transmitted direct to a client, who in turn used it to send data back to P&BA.
It might also be a summary derived from paperwork arising from a

transaction.

Queries raised might come from clients, branches or cash centres as

explained in the document.

There may have been scope for error in branch, at clients or in P&BA but
mitigations against this included balancing routines in branch, batch controls
in data transfers and the ability to request evidence to query the transaction

corrections.

Regarding POL00001697 (Royal Mail Internal Information. Back Office
Efficiency Programme-Stock Adjustments), and the work related to stock
adjustments, my recollection is not that it was suggesting Horizon Online

functionality was causing discrepancies through the way it processed the

Page 8 of 24
WITNO04630100
WITN04630100

user transaction, but rather that it created an opportunity for a sales icon on

screen to be used for unintended purposes.

35. | My recollection is that branches would sometimes select “other postage” as
a fast way to process a more complex transaction, with the expectation that
later in the day they would reverse the “other postage” transaction and put
the correct transaction through. They might also correct it by way of stock
adjustment. Horizon would accurately reflect the incorrect transaction they
entered. It could in turn have issues for sales data where sales were based

on stock movements.

36. My recollection is that the other issue in this area was in branches which
had a separate retail business as well as a Post Office. Customers obviously
only want to queue once and pay once, even if they were buying items from
both the retail side and the Post Office side. Branches therefore sometimes
used “other postage” as a way to process retail sales through the Post Office
side, with the expectation that they would reverse it and align the Post Office
and Retail tills later on. Again, Horizon would accurately record what the
user keyed as “other postage” and if, and until, it was corrected it would be
a “genuine error” in terms of genuine retail sales proceeds temporarily

recorded in the wrong till system.

37. | My recollection is that the stock adjustment project sought to resolve this. It
was tackling a consequence of operational challenges for retail branches
and customer service, not a functionality issue in terms of Horizon data

processing.

Review of Horizon Integrity

WITNO04630100
WITN04630100

Regarding POL00054371 (Emails regarding Horizon dispute cases), | don’t
recall that there were serious concerns within POL management about the
integrity of the Horizon system at that time. However, it was clearly
recognized that allegations were being made about the system and as one
of the writers of the emails states it was “to confirm our belief in the
robustness of the system.” POL had a number of in-house technical experts
and | do not recall a sense that the system was being doubted by these
specialists. There was also an understanding that there had been
independent technical reviews at deployment of the system, such as the
Gartner report referred to in POL00026572 (Horizon Response to
Challenges Regarding Systems Integrity). As a finance professional, | drew
comfort from in-house IT experts as regards the function of the system, and

the reference to reviews commissioned such as Gartner.

Regarding POL00026572, | confirm that | did write this report, after being
asked by David Smith to conduct a review in light of the challenges being
made about the system. It was a summary of existing conclusions, not a
fresh investigation. The conclusions came from internal discussions with
recipients of the document or with their team members that they

recommended be consulted, including IT.

The report suggested that Post Office Ltd was justified to assume that the
losses identified at audit were due to theft. This statement was based on the
understanding that POL management still did not have serious concerns
about the integrity of Horizon and so their view regarding the past cases
would not have changed. It was also made in light of the range of controls

and mitigations noted throughout the document. At that time, the belief was

Page 10 of 24
41.

42.

43.

WITNO04630100
WITN04630100

that the overwhelming evidence pointed to human error with respect to
shortfalls, that there was no independent expert evidence suggesting a
serious problem with Horizon and that POL had invested considerably in

mitigations including training and support.

The report was requested, and | wrote it, in an environment where
challenges were made about Horizon, but there was no ready document

available which pulled together reasons for assurance.

With the benefit of hindsight the report should have had a more formal
scoping exercise and then included terms of reference and attribution of
content. It should have had a more measured tone. However, my
recollection is that the report was deemed fit for purpose by the Managing
Director as a summary of existing understanding based on conclusions from

expert and specialist teams in POL.

In hindsight, my own perception and wider management perception of the
likely validity of allegations about Horizon may have been influenced by
such things as understandings of feedback at audit and by a belief in the
controls and mitigations which went on to be summarized in this 2010 paper.
With the benefit of hindsight | would therefore have summarized the same
lists of controls, but would not have made such an assertive executive
summary. | should simply have stated that these were the mitigating factors
noted from discussions with the report addressees or with their
representatives, and allowed those to be considered by the recipients. At
the time, however, the general belief amongst teams at POL, including IT,

led to the tone of the executive summary in the report.

WITNO04630100
WITN04630100

It may also have been helpful to have been able to reflect more about the
individual cases and challenges made, in order to determine how the
mitigations and Post Office understanding of each case compared against

the specific elements of each branches challenge.

The report should have explained more about the phrase “compassionate”,
in order to justify its use. In hindsight this word does read at odds with the

subsequent comment about the role of a Prosecuting Authority.

Any comment that there were no errors within the system that could account
for the losses was made in a context where it was understood that none of
the issues narrated in the report had been identified at the branches in

question.

Regarding the email POL00088956 (Emails: Follow up to BIS meeting on
JFSA Suspension cases) , | do not remember that email or what may have
happened subsequent to it, however, on the face of it it does beg a question
as to how it arose, how it was resolved and how it could be assured that it

hadn't happened before or couldn't happen again.

Regarding the Receipts and Payments Mismatch, the emails suggest that
Fujitsu were investigating in detail. | cannot remember what information |
would have had, nor the process | followed, but it looks like | had reviewed
some data leading to a set of specific questions which were either answered
or committed to be answered. On the face of these emails, in hindsight, it
appears from Fujitsu’s comments and from POL's Service Delivery Team
comments that Fujitsu were focused on explaining and resolving the issue.

| cannot recall how adequately | felt they ultimately dealt with it.

Page 12 of 24

53.

WITNO04630100
WITN04630100

Regarding FUJ00084797 (Emails: Local Suspense Problem), | cannot recall
what the local suspense problem was, what steps | may have taken nor any

views on how Fujitsu dealt with it.

Regarding FUJ00081880 (Peak Incident Management System) and
POL00029908 (Emails: Dalmellington Outreach Service-horizon transaction
discrepancies) again | cannot recall this specific incident, however, the
emails indicate that | would have been alerted on 20 October 2015 and |

have no reason to doubt that.

| agree with Anne Allaker that Fujitsu should have provided an explanation
for the four incidents. Within the email extracts there only appears to be
detailed narrative about events in the branch for the one named branch,
whereas the other four are referenced but with little content. The emails do,
however, suggest that a common approach was used to resolve the records

in three branches and that it may work for the fourth one.

With the passage of time | cannot say whether | would have felt this typical

for Fujitsu

Finally on that particular issue, my feeling today is that Kendra Dickinson
was right to be concerned about giving advice where the underlying
circumstances were unclear. However, in hindsight, | wonder whether a file
note could have been agreed with FSC and Cash Supply Chain to note the
situation on the known branches, to script a process for tracking any further
cases and to seek to agree a process and advice ahead of the branches
next balancing period. It would therefore perhaps have been appropriate to

log calls with all the affected branches with a view to explain that to them,

Page 13 of 24
WITNO04630100
WITN04630100

for their assurance too while the solution was being clarified

54. Regarding Changes in Branch Database in 2014, | cannot recall what
changes were made, nor whether | would have known at the time. My
recollection is that | had understood that Fujitsu could not “correct” or “inject”
transactions whereas FUJ00087118 (Emails: Branch Database and
Change Management Additional Questions) indicates that some form of

entry was possible.

55. POL00031410 (Post Office Ltd Risk and Compliance Committee. Project
Zebra Horizon review by Deloittes) explains that Deloitte had been
commissioned by General Counsel and CIO to conduct a desktop review
related to challenges that Horizon was defective. | cannot recall anything to
cause me to suggest any other description for their involvement than is given

in the introduction to that document

Audits

56. __| did not personally carry out audits. | was, however, responsible early in my
time at Post Office Ltd for the Branch Audit Team whose members carried
out audits at branches. These involved physical audits of cash and stock as
well as compliance audits of processes. The cash audit would involve a
temporary closure of the post office while a full asset check was conducted,
counting cash and stock at the counter and in the safes. Compliance audits
would involve discussion and review of processes which might range from
branch opening through Horizon password security and to product

compliance.

57. Regarding document POL00047544 (Post Office branch auditing- Period 6

Page 14 of 24
WITNO04630100
WITN04630100

Report 2004/5), the findings were cash shortages and the issues appear to
have included matters such personal cheques put in place of cash, cash
potentially moved elsewhere and issues of accounting for bureau de
change. Another issue was gaps in supervisory checks on stocks in Directly
Managed Branches. | cannot recall more specific topics to add to this paper
from 2004 nor what the conclusions of my report on Blackwood were. |
would, however, have carried out the review by speaking to members of the
Audit Team and Investigations Team who had been involved with this

particular branch. | may also have spoken with Network colleagues.

58. Regarding document POL00032162 (Risk and Compliance Committee
Minutes), it was the organisational stance that suspension was necessary.
The Financial Investigator involved in a case would have given
consideration to where money allegedly stolen may have gone to. There
had been other cases where money was understood to have gone to pay

off debts.

Policies

59. Regarding documents POL00030562 (Post Office Ltd. Losses Policy-
Overarching (Branches)) and POL00087409 (Product and Branch
Accounting: Write off Process) | cannot recall how | input to the policies.
However, where the policy states that “in general, agents are liable for all
losses, including counterfeits” | do remember being involved in a joint panel
with the NFSP where we reviewed counterfeit benefit cheques and agreed
to waive liability for many of them given the quality of the counterfeits that

we examined. It also led to further help to branches through ultra-violet lights

Page 15 of 24
WITNO04630100
WITN04630100

as well as guidance material. | believe that the Post Office took hardship into

account when applying the losses policy.

60. In hindsight there is a need for a policy but such policy should perhaps have
allowed for more interventions to waive its deployment based on the

circumstances of each situation.

61. | POL00087409 was intended to deal with where the cost of a write off was
borne within Post Office, as in should the cost be borne by the Network cost

centre or was there some reason why P&BA should bear the cost of it.

62. | think the comment that it could not be applied to discrepancies visible to
the branch is simply that such discrepancies would be a balancing issue in
the local accounts of the post office branch and so need resolving there,
whereas the purpose of this policy was about differences in the central

finance system ledgers.

Prosecutions

63. Regarding POL00055100 (Emails: Regina v Seema Misra- Guildford Crown
Court) and POL00055225 (Emails: West Byfleet-Mrs Seema Mirsa-access
to operations request) | do not recall what conversations | may have had,
however, given the description in the documents shared it suggests | may
have asked a question to clarify exactly what was being asked and whether
that was usual. It would not be appropriate for me to decline an appropriate
request and | would certainly not have done so, but | would have expected
Post Office legal team to confirm what an appropriate request was in order
that | or my team could take it forward. | think | would have expected a more
specific question and would then have been able to respond to that. | think

Page 16 of 24
WITNO04630100
WITN04630100

| felt that the request was too general.

64. Regarding POL00055418 (Emails: The Horizon Trial), given that the vast
majority of post offices were understood not to have significant concerns
about Horizon, and because of reassurance from audit risk modelling,
feedback from audit, training, support and the perspective of internal IT
specialists, | did not have serious concerns about the system myself, but |
would have been equally keen to be aware of new concerns arising in case
this would enable me and my team to positively support the resolution of

something if it became a confirmed issue.

65. Regarding POL00029535 (Emails: Response to Mr Paul Pope Dunstan
Branch) my recollection is that | didn’t have input into prosecution cases,
except in so far as my teams may be providing data in the routine support
of acase. My interpretation of this letter with an ECT reference is that it was
an Executive Correspondence Team matter and | may have been invited to
comment on that. | think this would have been rare and, if this was a
prosecution case, | don’t know if | would have known that from an ECT letter.
| do not therefore believe that isolated responses to such letters would

necessarily have impacted on my job.

Civil Claims

66. | explained in paragraph 34 that | had been asked to write a report in 2010
which gathered together reasons for assurance as regards Horizon. | am
afraid | cannot remember what cases | may have been approached about,
nor the detail of what they involved, but my recollection is that it was historic

cases included in the Second Sight review or preceding group claims, as

Page 17 of 24
WITNO04630100
WITN04630100

opposed to live or pending civil cases. | believe | would have been
approached in light of my role as Head of P&BA or in light of the 2010 report.
This, in conjunction with taking forward the development of the Finance
Service Centre and supporting an organization undergoing transformation

projects and efficiency targets in most areas, was very demanding.

Second Sight and Aftermath

67. As regards Second Sight, | was involved in responding to a number of

questions that they asked but | cannot remember the details.

68. | did at this time lead P&BA and was responsible for various teams who
issued transaction corrections to branches. Such transaction corrections
might arise from reconciliation of branch data against client data, or as a
result of a specific query from a branch or client. | could not, however, have
been responsible for identifying whether there were disparities in all

transactions.

6Bave Ibeen asked to comment on the Second Sight report. With the
passage of time | regret that | cannot remember what questions they asked

nor my responses.

70. 1 do not believe that | changed my view about Horizon and shortfalls as a

result of this review.

71. Regarding the question of 42 days and data availability | cannot remember
what data would have been available or what other records may have been
available in branch, but | would have expected that the Transaction

Correction would include some description of what it related to.

Page 18 of 24
WITNO04630100
WITN04630100

72. With the passage of time | cannot remember how | found working with

Second Sight at the time.

73. | cannot remember how the discussions went regarding the suspense
account, however, based on document POL00022297 (Emails: Suspense
Accounts) it appears that | set out the breadth of scenarios that arise across
different products and that it was not a short or simple thing to explain all
those variations. The implication appears to be that | could not give a short

answer.

Reflections

74. Throughout my time at POL my intention was to help to improve processes,
to support business transformation and to improve general service and

satisfaction for staff, agents and clients.

75. With the information that | now know, | would have escalated a risk around
Horizon onto the agenda of the Compliance Committee early in my tenure
at POL. At the time, however, | do not recall Horizon featuring as a risk on
the IT risk register. My recollection is that the IT view was that the allegations

at the time were unfounded.

76. Regarding report POL00026572, | would have tackled this differently; to
have had clearer scoping and attribution of comments, to have
substantiated or challenged the basis for describing “compassion” and to
have had a more balanced tone. | have included further hindsight reflections
in response to an earlier question in paragraphs 42 to 45. However, at the
time, | was tasked by the Managing Director with summarising existing
conclusions, not with challenging the basis for those conclusions. In

Page 19 of 24
WITNO04630100
WITN04630100

hindsight, it should perhaps have had a wider scope to challenge them.

77. | would also have challenged the capacity of myself and my team to deliver
at sufficient pace the competing priorities of this matter, of daily operational
processes and of engagement in a myriad of other transformational change
projects. The cost pressures of the organisation meant that we were
operating with continual headcount reduction targets, which itself required a
lot of time. In hindsight it may have been helpful to have clearer lines of
responsibility between the activities and further review of resourcing to

address organisational priorities.

78. There are clearly very many facets to this sad chain of events. On reflection,
going forwards, | would suggest more visibility of policies, for wider input
and challenge, and clear ownership of major systems like Horizon in order
that it would be clear who to escalate potential issues to and to have a clear
tracker for their resolution. A review of the system could also have been
considered earlier and a review of the actions that follow on when shortages

are identified at audit.

Statement of Truth

| believe the content of this statement to be true.
