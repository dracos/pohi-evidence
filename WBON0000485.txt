Dear Andy and Owain,
I enclose a complete first draft Defence, which pleasingly comes in at under 80 pages.

The back end of the pleasing (dealing with damages and then our defences) is somewhat rudimentary.
Owain, you will see that I have flagged some gaps and other points that you are the best person to address
(do a search for the word “Owain”).

Other things being equal, I would spend a few hours tomorrow morning considering the pleading and how it
could be improved/enhanced/tightened up. But in view of the cost constraints, I will do something
completely different instead.

Andy, you have control, although Owain ought to have a proper chance to review and suggest improvements
(including the gaps and points I have flagged for him).

Finally, we ought to arrange dates for the circulation and review of the next draft and for its transformation
into the final draft for client approval.

Best wishes,
Tony
