SUMMARY OF WORK:

Following a call with the Post Office PM on 7th January 2021, it was confirmed that there are
multiple initiatives being investigated within the Group Litigation Order (GLO) Programme
which would require Fujitsu Services Architecture support for reviewing requirements,
design work etc. In this meeting, Post Office requested that a draw-down pot for ad-hoc
Architecture support be progressed.

All requests for use of this pot must be raised by the Post Office Project Manager with the
Fujitsu Services Project Manager in order to ensure this is managed efficiently.

The following applies to this draw-down:

* On receipt of a request, where Fujitsu Services agrees to support a request, it will
provide a time and materials estimate to Post Office to carry out the request, which
will include PM, legal and other associated resources time.

¢ Fujitsu Services reserve the right to reject any request

* Any dates offered for the request to be fulfilled are indicative only, and do not
comprise a formal commitment.

* Bookings made against this project will be reported back to Post Office monthly in
arrears

e If work is underway and the funding available runs out prior to completion, all work
will be paused until further funding received

¢ Any conflict on resources due to operational and/or ongoing project work will be
called out and could result in the work on this draw down being re-prioritised.

¢ Post Office involvement may be required for some work items (i.e. to define
requirements), and the appropriate resource should be made available to assist.

* No changes will be implemented under this CWO, this will cover support/design
work only. Any requests for implementation must be made via the Change Control
Process

Any work performed under this CWO is based upon requirements from Post Office
