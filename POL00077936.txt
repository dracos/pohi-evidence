A Case Summary prepared the investigating officer for internal use;

Interview Transcripts;

Advice provided by Mr. Harry Bowyer of Counsel at Cartwright King dated

24 December 2013.

Comments:

No proceedings were commenced in this case and so no disclosure has

previously been made by Cartwright King.

It is worthy of note that various POL forms were signed by a suspect in the
name of Wasim Abbas who then gave his name when interviewed under
caution by POL investigators as Haji Nadeem Abbas. Harry Bowyer of
Counsel noted in his Advice of 2.4 December 2013 at para 14, “We need to
establish how he managed to be interviewed in this name without our investigators
noticing that the man who gave his name as Wasim on the 19 April 2013 was now

called Haji. This is bound to cause us considerable embarrassment at any trial.”

It follows that it was not Mr. Haji Abbas Choudry who was interviewed on

25' April 2013.
