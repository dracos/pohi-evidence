Hi Amy,

These were not disclosed but rather a description of how many KELs were deleted was provided in Stephen Parker's
witness statement. I attach a copy of the file from FJ (you might need IT to assist you with opening it) and the

password is t 3m0jsU&

Thanks,

Lucy

Matthew refers below a KEL extract being provided to us on 5 Nov 18 — are these documents in Relativity and have

they been disclosed? If not, where can I find them?

Hello Amy,

I think the question is why does “Historic_Kels.xlsx” + “Active_Kels.xlsx” not equal the KEL extract of 21-
Mar-2018, the difference being in “KELs not in Index.xlsx”.

The answer is that “Historic_Kels.xlsx” is Horizon only and contains no post 2010 HNG-X KELs, while
“Active_Kels.xlsx” only includes live, i.e. no deprecated or deleted KELs.

The KEL extract of March 2018 contains both Horizon and HNG-X KELs, both deprecated and non-
deprecated, but didn’t contain fully deleted KELs.

The fully deleted KELs were in the second extract that we provided on 05-Nov-2018.

I have asked the SSC team for the list of KEL entries which have been produced from 19 March 2018 to date.

Hi Matthew

I hope you are well.

Back in January of this year you provided us with two indexes of the KEL, an historic and active index (both attached).
We have noticed that there are a number of KEL entries which were in the KEL extraction, but not contained within
either of these indexes — a list of these KEL entries is also attached.

From a brief review, the KEL entries which are not in either of these indexes have a wide date range between 1999
and 2018 so I don't think the entries were generated after the indexes were produced. Please could you have a look
into whether there is a reason that the extract contained more KEL entries then were listed in the indexes?

Separately, would you be able to provide us with a list of KEL entries which have been produced from 19 March 2018
to date?

Kind regards

Amy
