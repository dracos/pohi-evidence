Hi

Courtesy of Southern Rail, I have reviewed in full at platforms 15-19 of Victoria Station. Unfortunately I cannot see track
changes on iPad.

lam fine with all of this and like the more assertive sections in particular. Right at the end I would like to know why we
would drop claims against applicants if they withdraw. The logic is clear but from eg a PAC perspective I would want to
understand the cost / benefit / what's right analysis.

Otherwise, I thought the response was excellent and would otherwise embolden.

Tom

All
Please find attached the draft Letter of Response (LOR).

The LOR is substantially ready for your review, save for two sections that will be addressed later: Remote
Access (as per our discussion at the SG meeting) and GLO (which is the subject of ongoing
correspondence with Freeths).

Your comments are welcomed on all of the LOR but may I ask that, as a minimum, you review the
sections marked for your attention in the attached spreadsheet.

I should be grateful if you could provide your amendments / comments by close of business on Tuesday
19 July 2016 before our next Steering Group meeting on 20 July 2016. If possible, please could you send
through comments / amendments by way of track changes to the letter.

In order to preserve legal privilege, please do not circulate the draft LOR to anyone else. You may
discuss it with colleagues if necessary to do so but if you need to forward it to someone else for input,
please can you speak to Rodric or me first.

Kind regards
Andy
