Dear all,

T’ve just spoken to Duncan Tait and thanked him for the support to date. But I have flagged a serious
concern about the fragility of our current position where FJ witness statements have either been disproved
and/or needed amending. I suggested that he has a frank phone call with Jane and Rob. (In hindsight, Mark
should also join.)

Duncan or Wendy will be in touch.

I covered the following areas:

1) as a result of the PM’s supplementary evidence setting a different line of argument and opening up new
challenges, POL needs to prepare further evidence - quickly but thoroughly and accurately. We require
rigour to answers around what the system could do (as opposed to should do); this includes considering
wider protocols and processes not just the inscrutability of the code and how the system ought to be
operated. We need his engineers to engage with the art of the possible.

2) a timeline is required that traces the issues historically to put the case into perspective

3) his witnesses would benefit from further prep and understanding of the angles and style they are likely to
come across - are they ready under pressure?

4) our Comms teams must work closely so they will be prepared if we decide to issue a sound and balanced.
narrative before the trial; and, ready with a rebuttal and strong reassuring counter campaign from day one of

the trial.
