Tom

Please find attached 6 summaries, one for each Lead Claimant. Rodric has asked that I send these to you subject to
the Information Sharing Protocol.

We can provide more detail as needed but hopefully these are a useful introduction to each case. I'd also be happy to
talk through any questions you might have once you've had a chance to review the summaries.

Kind regards

Andy
