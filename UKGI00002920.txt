Yes, things are in train, for example:

e = POLare preparing a line by line rebuttal of points raised in the debate

e Weare liaising with POL to write a letter to MPs who attended the debate to counter some of the points
raised. POL are actively considering offering, for example, MPs to attend the mediation sessions and offering
to share the details of each case with each complainants MP, should that complainant agree (and if they don’t
then one would have to ask why)

e Weare also seeking to prepare a “mythbusters” type document (or at least going to see what it looks like)

e There is a Horizon Board sub-committee at Post Office on Monday which I am going to, which will plot out the
way forward on this, and we will update Jo next week when we see her.

Hope that provides the assurance you need.

Subject: next steps on Horizons debate

Hi Richard,

Jo was asking me what the timeline for getting advice from POL on the next steps following the Horizons debate
would be. We can discuss it with her next week at the catch up but just wanted to check that was in train and see if
you’d agreed any deadlines with them? I think sometime in the next 2 weeks would be ideal.

Thanks,
Alysa
