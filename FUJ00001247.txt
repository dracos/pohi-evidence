4.1.3.3.1 Access Control

[R473, R816, R921]

All users are given a level of access to the system, or role, as
determined by their responsibilities within the office. For example,
counter clerks are limited to serve customer, balance and
reconciliation applications, whilst managers are given access to the full
range of counter and office administration functions. The structuring of
roles is determined by POCL and is documented in the Access Control
Policy.

Only those (exercising the roles) of the Post Office Manager or deputy
can start up the counters from cold. This is accomplished by inserting
a read-write Memory Card which holds a post office key value into the
smart card reader on the counter whose system unit provides the WAN
gateway function. The Post Office Manager authenticates himself to
by means of a PIN. The Pathway Key Management System downloads
a post office key which is stored (encrypted) in the Memory Card and
workstation. Only this action can unlock a workstation’s encrypted
filestore. The Post Office Manager then introduces the Memory Card
to each counter in turn

To refresh the key on expiry or at another time the Post Office
Manager can obtain a new key by signing on at the gateway machine.

To recover from a forgotten PIN or lost or damaged card the Post
Office Manager will verbally authenticate himself to the HS Help Desk
who will notify him verbally of a (one-shot) key. When entered at the
post office this key will trigger the KMS to refresh the post office key.

A similar technique is used for the POCL Emergency Manager/auditor

to assume Post Office Manager duties.

PASSWORD USAGE

Each user is allocated a password which is required to be changed at
pre-determined intervals (currently one month). The system prompts

for a change of password. Users additionally are able to change their
own passwords whenever they wish.

A lower-level password may be changed by the office manager if
necessary, for example, if a user has forgotten his password.

A similar mechanism to the above is used for POCL auditors, with the
result giving access to the Audit screen.

Successful and unsuccessful attempts to log on are recorded by the
system. This information is recorded along side the FAD code, counter
position and the date and time.

An external visitor, such as the Retail Network Manager can be given
access to the system by the office manager.

The possible migration to other methods of user sign-on is the subject
of Change Control

FUNCTION SELECTION
The log on screen is displayed following switch on of the terminal.

The clerk is required to:
e Key unique ID
e Key Password

The system :
e Identifies the current stock unit, if any, that is attached to the user

e Cleans up or recover any information processed prior to any
abnormal termination of the user’s previous session possibly due to
failure and advises the clerk of current status and any actions
required to complete the interrupted session in order to obviate one-
sided transactions

The user is presented with the main desktop showing:
e Help and Messages - first level functions provided by Riposte

e Serve Customer Functions - allowing all transactions to be
completed at the counter

e Counter Administration - allowing stock unit attachment, balancing,
transfers and remittances in and out

4.1.3.3.2 Counter Administration

[R695]
This section describes the counter administration facilities.

4.1.3.3.2.1. © THREE METHODS OF WORKING
The system allows the following post office working methods:

e Individual clerk accountability

e Team working

e ‘Sub post office accounting’

These working methods are supported by the following mechanisms:

e Each stock unit can be optionally marked as sharable (i.e. attached
to more than one user at a time)

e Each user is restricted to using only one stock unit at a time
selected from a defined set

‘Sub post office accounting’ is the flexible use of combinations of
features of the first two methods.

4.1.3.3.2.1.1 Support for Individual Clerk Accountability

This method of working can be achieved by ensuring that any single
stock unit is attached to only one clerk at a time. In this environment,
stock units would not be marked as sharable.

4.1.3.3.2.1.2 Support for Team Working

The system supports “team working” allowing a stock unit to be
attached to more than one user at the same time. The system does
not allow stock unit balancing while the stock unit is being shared.

4.1.3.3.2.1.3 Support for Sub Post Office Accounting

The system allow sub postmasters to adopt a combination of individual
accountability and stock unit sharing to suit their personal

requirements.

4.1.3.3.2.2 I SHARING A STOCK UNIT

Sharing a stock unit results when a stock unit is attached to more than
one user at one time. When sharing a stock unit a number of users
divide the administrative functions between them, e.g., the declaration
of cash and stock on hand may be carried out by each user and each
declaration represent that user’s proportion of the total for the stock
unit which is used for balancing purposes. The process for balancing
a shared stock unit is discussed in Section 4.1.3.3.2.8, Stock Unit
Balancing, below.

4.1.3.3.2.3. ATTACH A STOCK UNIT

This allows the user to select a stock unit for his use with the following
constraints:

¢ The stock unit must exist
e The user must not have a stock unit already assigned

Ifthe stock unit is not sharable it must not be attached to another
user

If the stock unit is not sharable it must be in a balanced state

4.1.3.3.2.4 START ANEW STOCK UNIT BALANCE PERIOD

After attaching a stock unit to a user a new balance period is opened
and started. All operations involving the stock unit are included within
this balance period until the stock unit is balanced again.

4.1.3.3.2.5 I DETACH A STOCK UNIT

This allows the user to relinquish responsibility for the stock unit. The
stock unit need not be in a balanced state.

4.1.3.3.2.6 STOCK TRANSFERS
[R807]

Stock can be transferred between stock units in the following way:

e The requesting user, the user receiving the stock, verbally agrees
with a sending user on the quantity and value of the stock required

e The sender responds with a ‘Transfer Out’ confirmation
e The sender gives the requester the agreed items

e The requester responds with a ‘Transfer In’ confirmation

EPOSS Service - EPOSS Administration Date: 30/9/97

4.1.3.3.2.6.1 Transfer Request
The transfer request is made verbally.

4.1.3.3.2.6.2 Transfer Out
The sender uses the ‘TRANSFER OUT’ function to input and record
the quantity and value for each stock item. When completed a
‘Transfer Out’ slip is printed by the sender using the counter printer.
This process generates transfer out transactions and decreases the
stock unit's levels.

4.1.3.3.2.6.3 Transfer In
The requester uses the ‘TRANSFER IN’ function to input and record
the quantity and value for each stock item to be taken in. When this is
completed a ‘Transfer In’ information slip is printed by the requester
using the counter printer. This process generates transfer in
transactions and increases the stock unit's levels.

4.1.3.3.2.6.4 Transfer Completion
The physical exchange of stock is accompanied by the signing of the
‘Transfer Out’ receipt by the requester. The sender keeps the signed
receipt as proof of the transaction.

4.1.3.3.2.7 REMITTANCES
Stock, including cash, remittances occur:

e Between two outlets, when one outlet requests a replenishment of
stock from another nearby

e When an outlet orders stock or receives stock routinely
« When an outlet returns stock

[DN: The procedures by which remittances to or from non-automated
locations are handled is to be confirmed.]

4.1.3.3.2.7.1 Remittances In

An automated receiving outlet confirms the receipt of items using the
‘Remittance In’ function. It uses the ‘REMITTANCE IN’ function to enter
the quantity and value for each stock item that has been received.
When this is completed a ‘Remittance In’ slip is printed. This process
generates Remittance In transactions and increases the stock levels.
In a non-automated office this process and the production of the
‘REMITTANCE IN’ slip is handled manually.

4.1.3.3.2.7.2 Remittances Out

4.1.3.3.2.7.3

4.1.3.3.2.8

An automated outlet or CRU uses the ‘REMITTANCE OUT’ function to
enter the quantity and value for each stock item. When completed a
‘Remittance Out’ slip (i.e. consignment note) is printed. This process
generates remittance out transactions and decreases the sender’s
stock levels. In a non-automated office this process and the production
of the ‘REMITTANCE OUT’ slip is handled manually.

Remittance Completion

The physical receipt of stock is completed by the signing of the
‘Remittance Out’ slip by the receiving outlet. This may be sent to the
sending outlet or CRU as proof of the transaction according to POCL
practice.

STOCK UNIT BALANCING
[R695, R837]

Stock unit balancing is the process of reconciling the user’s current
stock unit contents against the transactions completed and the

opening stock unit contents. Each stock unit must be balanced at the
end of the Cash Account period, traditionally a week. The system
imposes controls such that mandatory reports are produced before ‘roll-
over’. At this point the stock unit is rolled-over to the next Cash
Account.

In addition to this compulsory balancing, a stock unit may be balanced
at any time during the Cash Account. Specifically the user balances
an unshared stock unit at the end of the duty period. A shared stock
unit cannot be balanced whilst it is still being used for sharing. The
stock unit is balanced by the last user to be attached to the stock unit.

The system produces a ‘Stock Unit Balance’ report providing a
summary of the clerk’s activity during the balance period. A copy of
this form is also used as the office balance form and this is the
amalgamation of all counter balance forms in a Cash Account.

Individual till balance reports are produced for shares of shared stock
units. These reports are printed on the counter printer.

Formats for these reports are provided in the Horizon OPS Reports &
Receipts specification.

Although balancing is a largely automatic process, the counter clerk
must have performed the following activities:

¢ Confirm all the stock and cash movements (transfers and
remittances)

¢ Declare actual cash in hand

e Declare actual stock in hand

4.1.3.3.2.8.1 Declare Stock in Hand
The clerk declares the actual physical stock unit contents for particular
(composite) stock items by either declaring or adjusting the amount of
stock on hand. For shared stock units, adjustments may only be made
when the clerk has unshared access to the stock unit. The system
maintains a record of all stock items. If there is any difference
between the actual stock declared and the stock as maintained by the
system, this is an indication that one or more errors have occurred and
an adjustment may be necessary.

4.1.3.3.2.8.2 Print Stock in Hand Report

This facility produces a printed report of all stock items within the stock
unit.

4.1.3.3.2.8.3 Declare Cash in Hand
[R814]

The clerk verifies the actual physical cash in hand in the stock unit by
denomination, (including coins). If there is a difference between the
total maintained by the system, this is an indication that one or more
errors have occurred and an adjustment may be necessary.

4.1.3.3.2.8.4 Daily Cash Locked Up
The system provides an optional function ‘Declare Cash in Hand’ for
use at the end day for all stock units. This information is used
subsequently, possibly retrospectively, by POCL to manage the
overnight cash holding for the outlet. Such declarations do not update
any stock unit cash balance.

4.1.3.3.2.8.5 Produce Balances
The clerk completes one or more trial balances before accepting a
balance as final, enabling him to rectify errors prior to the stock unit
balance period being closed. The final balance closes the stock unit
balance period and allows the detachment of the stock unit.

Discrepancies (losses and gains) identified at the point of balancing
are retained within the stock unit. A balance may be accepted as final
provided that there are no negative stock holdings.

4.1.3.3.2.8.6 Declare Losses and Gains

The system identifies losses and gains as part of the balancing
process.

4.1.3.3.2.8.7 Clear Losses and Gains

The clerk may clear losses and gains to remove them from the office
balance upon resolution of any queries.

4.1.3.3.2.8.8 Dormant and Resting Stock Units
[R814, R815]

Stock units which have had no traffic during the balancing period and
stock units which are not attached to a user at the time the office is
balanced are consolidated on the basis of their last-balanced position.

[DN: Whether a dormant stock unit for which a revaluation is required
is prevented from being rolled over without opening is to be defined.]

4.1.3.3.2.8.9 Adjustments
[R695, R549]

Adjustments may be made to rectify individual transactions or can be
non-transaction specific in their nature.

This process of reversing transactions is also described in Section
4.1.3.1.12, Reverse a Transaction. The clerk may reverse transactions
that are reversible. Any reversal does not result in transaction
information in the journal being amended but causes the insertion of
additional compensating and correcting transactions. All reversible
transactions may be reversed at any time during the Cash Account
period unless specifically prohibited, for example, APS transactions
already notified to the Client.

4.1.3.3.2.9 I DISPLAY AND PRINT REPORTS AND CLIENT SUMMARIES
[R696]

The office print-previews and prints reports and Client summaries
required using data extracted from the stock unit and user as well as
by day, time and date. The formats of reports are specified in the
Horizon OPS Reports & Receipts specification.

4.1.3.3.2.10 AP CLIENT TRANSACTION CUT-OFFS
[R890]

This facility declares a cut-off time by transaction type and client. This
effectively sets a watershed marker indicating the production of the
transaction summary reports and the physical despatch of paperwork
to the AP Client. EPOSS restricts, or strictly controls, the opportunity
to rectify errors which have already been included in the information
despatched.

4.1.3.3.2.11 END OF DAY
The effect of the End of Day process is to allow a set of activities that
must occur on a daily basis. This function allows activities such as
Daily Cash Locked Up and Client Transaction Cut-Offs, which are
prerequisites to End of Day, to occur.

The aggregate of Daily Cash Locked Up for the office as a whole is
available for postmaster information.

ROLL-OVER[R814, R815]

The final balance period for the stock unit in the Cash Account period
is identified through the Roll-over function. The next balance period
for this stock unit is 1 (one) in the subsequent Cash Account. The last
set of balance information for each stock unit at roll-over, plus a subset
of data from previous balance periods since the last roll-over, is used
to produce the office balance and the Cash Account report.

Roll-over can only be applied to a stock unit which is in a balanced
state and for which mandatory reports have been produced. This
means that it has been balanced and that no subsequent operations
involving customer serving, stock transfers, reversals or other activities
which would imbalance the stock unit have occurred.

A stock unit cannot be rolled-over while it is being shared. All but the
last sharer of a shared stock unit must detach from it in order that it
can be balanced and rolled-over.

Dormant and resting stock units are by definition in a balanced state
and must be rolled over.

The generic rules for ordinary operation and detailed exceptions
conditions is defined in Day-in-the-Life-of Analysis of Clerk Cycles.

4.1.3.3.3 Office Administration

the system is disabled whilst details are being modified.

4.1.3.3.3.2 I STOCK UNIT MAINTENANCE

4.1.3.3.3.2.1 Add Stock Unit

This allows new stock units to be introduced into the system. Each
stock unit has a unique ID, and / or name and an access level.

4.1.3.3.3.2.2 Remove Stock Unit

This allows stock units to be removed or deleted from the system. A
stock unit can only be removed if it is not in use and is empty.

4.1.3.3.3.2.3 Modify Stock Unit

This allows a stock unit’s details, such as access levels, to be
changed. Such changes may be applied only if the stock unit is in an
appropriate state. It can be suspended without deleting it from the
system.

4.1.3.3.3.3. ATTACH/DETACH A STOCK UNIT

This allows a selected stock unit to be attached to a selected user at
the counter. This is similar to the counter administration function and
is provided here for convenience.

In the event of the unavailability of the counter clerk, for example due
to sudden illness, the facility is available to allow an authorised user to
detach the stock unit and reattach it to another user.

4.1.3.3.4 The Cash Account

[R819, R834]

The Cash Account is a definitive summary of all of the business
transacted at the Post Office during the Cash Account period,
traditionally a week. The production of the Cash Account can only
occur after all activities in that Cash Account have been completed.

The Cash Account production process can be carried out on the data
collected for one Cash Account following balancing of the stock units,
whilst these are being used to serve customers in the next Cash
Account.

The pre-Pathway systems utilise three styles of Cash Account:
London, Provincial and CRU. The Pathway solution provides for the
merging of the London and Provincial styles.

4.1.3.3.4.1

4.1.3.3.4.2

The requirement is for the Cash Account to be produced in both
printed and electronic forms. The latter is also transmitted from the
Office to TIP.

The production of the Cash Account follows the successful completion
of the office balance. Unclaimed Payments and Uncharged Receipts
and Error Notices are derived and added.

Error Notices are treated as a class of tradeable products and enter
the Cash Account as a result of a buy or sell transaction.

OFFICE BALANCE (WEEKLY CASH BOOK)
[R808]

The office balance is analogous to the weekly cash book used in sub-
post offices. For the purposes of this document the weekly cash book
is considered to be equivalent of the office balance.

The production of the office balance is a precursor to the production of
the Cash Account. Essentially the office balance is an amalgamation
of all the individual stock unit balances within the cash account. In
order to produce the office balance all stock units must have been
balanced and “rolled-over” to the next cash account week.

A facility to reconcile non-value items with unique serial numbers by
volume and within stock unit is provided.

A suspense account allows entries that cannot be resolved until after
the Cash Account to be carried forward

The system provides an office level snapshot, at any time, of
transactions, cash and stock levels across all stock units. The same
facility is available to provide an instant snapshot of the transactions
and contents of any single stock unit. These snapshots relate to an
instant in real time. They neither place any constraint on operations
nor take into account work in progress .

NON-ACCOUNTING DATA
[R838]

EPOSS allows a class of transactions to be processed which may, or
may not, affect the office balance, but the data for which is required for
management information. Examples are zero value transactions for
Clients, or local schemes where only volumes and not value are
collected. The associated journal entries are disregarded when
accounting for the office but are destined to be used in management
information at the centre, particularly in Remuneration calculations.

4.1.3.3.4.7

The Cash Account report may be reviewed for completeness and
accuracy prior to its acceptance. The acceptance of the Cash Account
report allows the selection of an “end of account” function. This “rolls-
over” the office to next Cash Account and makes figures available to
subsequent processes such as Remuneration.

ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS

This function allows an authorised user to apply adjustment
transactions as required for the office balance process

TRANSACTION REVERSALS
[R804, R805, R812]

A facility is provided to allow the reversal of transactions.

The user, clerk or office manager, selects the stock unit balance period
and browses the transaction journal in order to find and select the
transaction for reversal. The scope of the browsing may be
parameterised to locate entries more easily. Additionally the reversal
may relate to no specific transaction. A loss or gain transaction may
need to be generated to account for any cash (or other MoP) involved
in the transaction. The stock unit balance report and any client
summary needs to be re-printed to reflect the reversal.

If the AP transaction has already been despatched from the office then
it is not reversible. The error will probably result in the receipt of an
error notice from the Client.

Note
There is a distinction between a reversal for accounting corrections,

such as the loss of a foil or stub, and a reversal due to a transaction
refund (for example, when a customer changes his mind).

[DN: Whether a reversal for a transaction from a previous balance
period should be prevented is to be determined.]

STOCK RECORD ADJUSTMENTS
[R802, R813]
Stock level modifications for value stock and MoPs do not require

transactions to be reversed or created, but are effected through the
stock and cash declaration functions, see above.

4.1.3.3.4.8 I REVALUATIONS

Revaluation of value stock, and varieties of cash which can assume
different values, occurs automatically as a result of the next stock or
cash declaration after associated Reference Data becomes applicable.
At the time that a clerk attaches to a stock unit, the clerk is prompted to
accept or adjust the stock item or items that are subject to revaluation.
Transactions which occur before such new Reference Data becomes
applicable are accounted for at the prior value.

The balancing implications of these operations is defined in the
EPOSS Functional Specification.

4.1.3.3.5 Reference Data Local Maintenance

[R531, R532, R533, R534, R833, R949]
For training purposes, EPOSS provides a built-in training mode which:

e Allows the serving of (imaginary) customers for all customer
transactions

e Allows all operations used in accounting and balancing of a stock
unit

e Is generally functionally indistinguishable from normal operation,
except that a clear indication is permanently provided that training
mode is in use

e Records all counter operations and transactions

e Can be used at any time by any user (including a live post office
environment)

e Allows the production of receipts and reports

The EPOSS application provides an effective training mode through
the implementation of “training” stock units and segregates these from
operational stock units and the normal office accounting processes.

Some limitations to training mode may be necessary in relation to APS
where there would otherwise be an update of a portable token.

Training transactions and any subsequent analysis are not accounted
within the scorecard.

4.1.3.3.6.1 TRAINING STOCK UNIT

All stock units have a Type attribute. A normal stock unit has its Type
set to “Normal”, but a training stock unit is set to “Training”.

4.1.3.3.6.2 I WORKING IN TRAINING MODE

To activate training mode, the user simply has to attach to a training
stock unit instead of a normal one. When this is done the system is
automatically set into training mode.

Pathway specifies a training “role” which allows attachment only to

training stock units.

4.1.3.3.6.3 EXITING TRAINING MODE

To exit training mode, the user just detaches from the training stock
unit.

4.1.3.3.6.4 CREATING TRAINING STOCK UNITS

The system has a default set of training stock units on installation.
The number and contents of each training stock can be tailored to suit
the individual office environment using the office administration
functions.

4.1.3.3.6.5 INDICATING TRAINING MODE IS ACTIVE
Since the training mode operation is intended to be functionally
identical to normal operation a clear and permanent indication is given
to ensure that the user is aware that training mode is active.

In training mode the screen background is a different colour from
normal operation. and the word “TRAINING” is permanently displayed
in large type inset in to the background. Any stock unit level reports
are marked “TRAINING”.

4.1.3.3.6.6 I TRAINING MODE COUNTER OPERATION
Counter functionality which involves the use of a stock unit continues
to operate in the same way for a training stock. Exceptions to this are
those operations which involve other stock units, such as stock
transfers. Such functions only operate between training stock units.

4.1.3.3.6.7 I EXCLUDING TRAINING FROM ACCOUNTING

The office accounting, balancing and reporting process automatically
detects and excludes training mode transactions.

Training data can be analysed to provide information about the use of
training mode within a post office.

4.1.3.3.6.8 I USING TRAINING DATA

Some transactions involve the use of centrally distributed data. For
example, BES uses payment authorisation data distributed by PAS via
TMS.

The use of centrally distributed test data for these transactions is
useful for testing and training. This data can be used in combination
with a training stock unit to provide a very effective training
environment.

4.1.3.3.6.9 I HOW TMS HANDLES TRAINING TRANSACTION DATA
Transaction data recorded during training mode is marked as such so
that TMS can isolate it and handle it effectively. This data can be
analysed at TMS level to provide information about the use of training
mode within the post offices.

4.1.3.3.7 Broadcasts & Documents
[R471, R481, R482, R483, R484, R485, R486, R896, R913]

4.1.3.3.7.1_ BROADCASTS

Using TMS and OPS it is possible to broadcast short messages, up to
2Kb, to all or a subset of outlets.

The user is prompted that messages are outstanding by an indicator
on the top of his screen. On selecting the appropriate icon the user is
presented with a list of messages with an indicator showing whether
they have been read.

Each counter position accesses these messages and selectively opens
and views messages. Reading a message is recorded in the journal.
The message is capable of being printed on the back office printer.

The means by which such broadcast messages are to be prepared,
authorised and admitted to the system is defined in the Pathway to TIP
Application Interface Specification.

4.1.3.3.7.2_ DOCUMENTS

Users are able to access electronically held information such as is
currently published in ‘Counter News’ and in the operations manuals.

A general facility which enables these and other documents to be
viewed locally is provided. Documents are supplied in a suitable
format (e.g. HTML, RTF/Microsoft Word). Access to these documents
is via an application from the user's desktop.

This facility may be used to access Process & Procedures Document.
This covers all aspects of EPOSS counter transactions and
administration and is a maintained document approved by POCL.
