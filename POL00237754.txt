Updates below:

Fujitsu to:

share its previously supplied comments on the Second Sight Reports (Monday / Tuesday); Attached. Thanks,
I will forward on

detail the number of branches affected by the ‘Falkirk bug’ vs its ‘capability’ to affect, with reasons (Monday /
Tuesday); Due to the date of this issue we do not have exact details of the number of branches affected. The
following answer is being currently ratified by the support team but we believe at this moment in time to be
correct .“This particular bug however could have affected all branches who have multiple stock units. The
Misra case where this issue was mentioned was dismissed as the branch had a single stock unit.’

How many branches have multiple stock units? The majority but exact figures for this period
not available, normally single counter branches.

Do we know why branches with multiple stock units were / were not affected? This issue involved
moving money between stock units so with a single stock unit this is not possible Yes, I understand this
but my question was why some branches with multiple stock units were affected and some, also with
multiple stock units, were not? This is a particular point raised by Jonathan at the meeting, so it will be
asked.

I will wait for the final answer to be provided, as referenced above, by Fujitsu’s support
team. The answer above has been confirmed

provide the number of system errors identified, by year, that could affect branch accounts together with the
number of branches that were affected and were capable of being affected by these errors, together with
reasons (Wednesday); Fujitsu is endeavouring to provide detail as to the number of Hotfixes (fixes to the
software where it has been agreed with Post Office that an urgent change is required due to some aspect of the
operation of the software) that have been issued with some examples of the type of fixes issued. I am still
awaiting agreement on when this information will be available. If a more detailed report of what each fix was
and whether it affected branch accounts I would be able to commission this in January and at that point deliver
costs and timescales for such an activity.

Thank you, please let me know when, as referenced above, you receive agreement on when
POL00237754
POL00237754

this information will be available

investigate its email / data retention policy and how this would, if asked for the information, affect its ability
to provide the emails for those Fujitsu employees who worked at Bracknell in 2008/09 (Monday / Tuesday);
Save for particular matters (which this particular matter was not one), Fujitsu leaves much of this to the
individual particularly in archiving to local storage. If Post Office has a request for email information it would
therefore need to be dealt with on a case by case basis checked against other legal and data protection criteria.

Does Fujitsu not, as a matter of course, archive its own emails as well? No it is the responsibility of the
individual and account to keep relevant detail if this is in an email. Rather than the contents of emails,
my question was — Does Fujitsu save / store all emails of its employees for X number of years, in the
same way documents are kept for 6/7 years?. It seems very strange that you would not?

answer the questions posed in Jonathan’s letter of 16/12/2015 (the letter was forwarded on 17/12/2015. I will
call Fujitsu on Monday morning to obtain an ETA); Mike Harvey has supplied an answer for this question and

Received, Thank you. This seems very sensible to me. I will, however, wait on Rodric to see if
he has any comments.

Comment on Page 6 of Deloitte’s Board Briefing Paper. I understand Fujitsu were approached and provided
comment at the time this paper was issued. We have requested this is shared with us (Monday / Tuesday).
Answer to follow in a separate email.

I will review. Thanks
Will call tomorrow to discuss further
