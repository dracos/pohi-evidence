Subject: Action from your visit to the IT Commercial Team meeting
David,

You asked who in Post Office was instructing the lawyers in the case referred to in the following risk on the IT risk
register:

"Damage to reputation of Post Office and potential future financial losses if PO loses court case relating to reliability
of Horizon accounting data at Cleveleys Branch Office."

The instructions have been provided by Carol King (in Transaction Processing). The case was being handled by Jim
Cruise in Legal Services. Jim has now left Royal Mail and the work is oursourced to Weightmans Vizard, who handle
such cases for us in the North West. The case is scheduled for the week commencing 16 August. We have offered
settlement and paid money into court based on what the subpostmistress would have received for 3 months notice.

Regards,

Keith
