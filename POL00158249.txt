Hi Tim

As discussed yesterday, please see attached draft response to the Baroness.

Can you please let me know if you are happy with the content and I will get this printed off
on our letterhead - are you still in London so I can meet up with you to sign personally?
Just conscious that you are away next week.

Jane has asked me to let you know that we will be back to you before the end of the week
with a draft scope and a recommendation as to QCs.

Many thanks
Di
