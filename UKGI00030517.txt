Hi Mark,

Sounds good to me — please see attached the presentation slide we used.

If you could reflect any changes in language in the word doc too that would be great.
Cheers,

Josh

Thanks Tim ~ understood.

Would it be possible to be provide with the ‘source’ versions of the 3 structure diagrams included within the concept
paper. With your permission, I would like to include them in the POL Board Paper but tweak some of the language used
~— nothing material but, for example changing “POL Litigation Executive” to “Historical Issues General Executive”.

Mark,

Josh pointed out that my email below might suggest BEIS only considered the external option. That’s not the case, and
apologies for any confusion. We did look at the internal structure, but people took this as a given (noting that while it
would free up management time it would still ‘distract’ at Board level). The discussion was mostly around the second
option, as it’s more complex.

Cheers!

Mark,

On your first question there was no clear preference. In a perfect world I think people saw the merits in the NewCo
approach, albeit they noted the handling risks of POL being perceived to be ridding itself of the liabilities/accountability,
but they also noted that we don’t live in a perfect world and the complexities of setting up a NewCo might be tricky (i.e.
at best it would take longer). BEIS Finance were interested in where the costs of operating the NewCo would land (we
said that was something we would need to work out but, compared to any compensation, it probably gets lost in the
rounding).

On funding, BEIS do understand this though as is typical in government we will need to keep telling them (at all levels, so
something to note for Nick and Tim I think). I know it’s tricky but the sooner we can have some views on what the
potential exposures look like size-wise the better as we will have a clearer message. I would probably say HMT didn’t
appreciate the funding challenge though we’ve now made that clear to them (again, their reaction is always going to
hinge on how much).

On your point about this being a high level paper, that’s really up to you. Between you and me (and those on cc), and
hearing Nick earlier in the week wanting to do something about this in the very short term, I think it’s pretty clear which
UKGI00030517
UKGI00030517

option is preferable and I don’t think detailed analysis is required to make that recommendation. But then I don’t sit on
the Board or earn the big bucks.

Hope that’s useful.

Give me a call if you want to talk.
Thanks,

Tim

Thanks Tim,

Owing to governance routes at Post Office, although the Post Office July Board does not take place until 28 July, the
paper needs to flow through the GE meeting of 15 July first. Papers are due for that meeting on 10 July but are reviewed
by various senior stakeholders beforehand ~ the deadline for which would typically be

As such, I am looking to try to finalise a draft this week, ahead of Di (Ben’s PA) scheduling separate meetings with
yourselves, Carl Cresswell and Carla Stent (The Chair of our Audit & Risk Committee) next week. Di should be in contact
regarding these meetings today, but owing to the timeframes, I just wanted to flag that the paper will be high level. It
should however be of sufficient detail to allow the POL Board make a decision regarding which option they wish to
pursue.

Couid I ask whether:

- HMT & BEIS, at first blush of course, expressed a preference between an internal restructure/ ring-fence within
the existing POL group or the creation of a separate legal entity outside of the POL Group?

-  HMT & BEIS recognised that POL would not be able to continue to finance these matters - particularly in the
financial exposure risks chrystallise {individually or as a collective) ~ and that a new funding mechanism would
need to be agreed?

Many thanks

Mark,

You’re right to chase, sorry for the delay.

From our side the substance of what we are saying is no different to when we last shared the note with you, but what
we would ask for is that in anything POL prepares you set out very clearly what the strengths and weaknesses of each
option is (to you, as well as to HMG and we can help you on this part) and also the criteria you would use to appraise the
options (a similar point to the strengths and weaknesses I know, but slightly different all the same).

We would expect to receive a proposal from you (say in two weeks’ time) regarding your recommended option which,
although we would be expecting to engage with you as this is developed, will let BEIS formally consider what course of
action you want to take.

From our conversations with BEIS and HMT there were no showstoppers but as with all these things the devil is usually
in the detail. And on this point, for the moment, don’t get yourself bogged down in a funding solution since both options
will very likely require something a little different and outside the normal course subsidy we have historically provided
to the business.

ve attached the final version of the note for completeness.

Thanks,

Tim

Hi Tim,
I hope you are well.

Towards the end of our helpful meeting last week, you mentioned that you intended to socialise the concept paper
amongst BEIS and HMT this week. Have you had any feedback just yet?

As you will appreciate, the timings for pulling together a draft paper for the July Board are tight (I would like be able to
socialise a near final version amongst key stakeholders, such as yourselves, from 1 July) and as such, I would be very
grateful if you are able to share any views which may have been expressed — even if preliminary?

Kind Regards

Mark
