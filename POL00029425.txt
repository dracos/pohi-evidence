* Training Office producing a balance snapshot where data hasn't been reset for a very long time (PC0210277)
Solution - ATOS
SMC / counter eventing team: raise a B priority call and send to SSC if you see this event, unless it is from a training
counter which has not Reset data for several months (branch code starts 9, use Smiley button A// Training Offices on

BRDB/BRSS tab and check the LAST RESET date).

SSC: Instances of this error must be investigated. If the error is as a result of a new problem, please add the details to the list
of causes above.

The branch accounts may need to be corrected. See wrightm33145J for advice on how this has been done for a previous
