TRIAL - 15TH MARCH 2010E4

Gareth,
Thank you for your E-Mail of 1st March 2010.

I now enclose Defence Expert's 4th and 5th reports after his conversation with you of the 12th
February 2010. As you are our Horizon Expert you need to telephone Charles McLachlan, his mobile
telephone number is I to arrange a meeting where you can discuss all his reports and
his concerns about thé Horizon so you can deal with it and rebut it which you have done in your long
telephone conversation about his various hypothesis and then write a detailed report which would go
to someway of progressing and concluding this matter and importantly preserving the Horizon system.

May be the simplest and practical way of dealing with this whole question is to find a shortest span of
logs, analyse it, disprove or rebut what the Defence Expert is saying in his reports.

Just a reminder you are an Expert for Fujitsu, you will be giving evidence in Court, the Judge and Jury
will be listening to you very carefully and a lot will hang on the evidence.

The way forward is for you to arrange an immediate meeting with the Defence Expert and conclude
this matter once and for all.

Kind regards.

TRIAL - 15TH MARCH 2010

‘01/03/2010 10:35

Jarnail,

Thanks for the information, which I've now read through.
I think I can summarise the situation as follows:

a. Ms Misera says initially identified that the sub post office was
short. of cash by about £80 - £90K

2. She tried to cover this up while she repaid the loses which she
thought was due to staff theft

3. By the time of the audit in Jan 2008 she was £73K short suggesting
she had made good about £10K of the losses

4. When she went to court, she saw an article in Computer Weekly
indicating that Horizon was unreliable and decided to jump on the
bandwagon.

5. Note that there is no evidence to support any of the cases
referenced in the Computer Weekly articles and there is case law showing

the reliability of Horizon. (The case of Marine Drive which I think was
referred to in the Computer Weekly article.)

However I don't see how anything here changes the fact that she falsified
the accounts or that money was missing.

What I still don't understand is exactly what it is that the defence is

claiming in terms of where exactly Horizonmight have "lost" this money
rather than her / Therefore unless we can get a
clear statement as to exactly what is being looked for and when the system
allegedly made mistakes, I don't thinkthere is anything I can do. (I do
appreciate that it is up to the Prosecution to prove Horizon is reliable
xather than the defence to prove it isn't, but it is always difficult to
prove that there are no errors - particularly over such a long period of
time.)

Surely it is down to the Post Office investigators to get to the bottom of
exactly where there is anything in dispute. At that point I might be able

to assist with some technical knowledge to help interpret the various logs
to support such areas of dispute.

I'll leave Penny to continue the discussions she is currently having with
the Post Office investigators until there is something concrete for me to
investigate.

Regards

Gareth
