Powers of Search

Investigation Managers have no statutory power of search, and itis
important to avoid creating any misapprehensions on this point
vwhen dealing with suspected offenders,

Inthe absence of search warrant, an Investigation Manager may
search a suspected offender, their private motor vehicle and their
Home, but only if that person's written consent as been obtained,
Additionally, the person searched must be told that they are nat
obliged to consent toa search, and that, if anything is setze, t may
be used in evidence,

Consent also needs to be obtained before a search ofa personal
locker can be caried out. However, if this consents nat glen, the
ffcal locker canbe searched on the basis that tis the property of
Royal Nail Group,

A universal search consent form, GS005, should be completed
and signed prior to all searches,

How Does a Computer Work?

Before you seize a computer, itis important to appreciate in very
simple terms how a computer works, and the consequence of
incorect handling The diagram of a computer hard disk is
provided for you,

The disk is divided into individual rings called Tracks, and cross-
sectionally into Sectors. Each Sector is capable of storing 542 bytes
of data, One fll page of text corresponds approximately to 1024

bytes (1Kb),

Anvindex ists the location of the data in each Sector, When you
ask the computer to retrieve the letter that you stored as

Memol.doc, for example, the hard disk looks atthe index, finds
where this letter is stored and retrieves it, The letter may have
been stored in one or more Sectors, depending on size,
