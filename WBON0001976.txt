My thought is that we need to disclose the deleted KELs — the Cs case is that they are adverse documents so I don't
think we have an option.

Many thanks

Hi Amy,

These haven't been disclosed to Robert — we think he has obtained the information because they are referenced in
another PEAK/KEL (I've looked and located the relevant ones that reference them).

Jonny has raised the query of whether we need to now disclose the deleted KELs — JG any comments welcome.

Hi Lucy

In the letter from Freeths yesterday, they requested disclosure of 2 KELs which were referred to Robert's report but
had not been disclosed.

Matthew has identified these as deleted KELs, which explains why they were not disclosed to Freeths. Couple of Qs
so as I can respond to Freeths:

Have the deleted KELs been given to Robert?

Alternatively, do you know if Robert has referred to KELs in his report which he has not been given copies of but he
knows exist / are relevant due to the KELs being referred to in a PEAK?

Many thanks

Amy
