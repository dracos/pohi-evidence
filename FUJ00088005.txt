Description
Version: 1.0
Commercial in Confidence Date: 11/02/00

With the exception of Post Office Logon messages, the text of which is given
explicitly in this PPD, the screen messages described in this PPD are
summarised and suffixed with a cross-reference in the form: ‘[Message
Collection:ObjectName]’ where Collection is the Collection name and
ObjectName is the ObjectName within this collection. These relate to an entry
in the Horizon OPS Desktop Messages and Help Text: CSR+ [Ref.
SD/DOC/009] that defines the text of the message.

The Horizon System Helpdesk calls described in this PPD are cross-
referenced to the calls described in the CSR+ Horizon System Helpdesk PPD
[Ref. CS/PRO/092] as follows: ‘Telephone the Horizon System Helpdesk
[HSH call ref] where ref is the call reference, for example SECO03. (Note that
these cross-references are provided solely to assist PPD reviewers; the call
references are not relevant to the helpdesk callers.)

Note: when the term ‘workstation’ is used in this PPD, it refers to the Horizon
system PCs at the outlet. A workstation is sometimes also referred to as a
counter.

3 Overview

Different levels of access are provided to the Horizon system according to
role.

e Routine access

All users are given a level of access to the system as determined by their
responsibilities in the office. For example, only managers are allowed to
create users. A full list of the applications to which each type of user is
allowed access is given in the Horizon OPS Menu Hierarchy document:
CSR+ [Ref. SD/SPE/033].

e Non-routine access

If a Post Office Counters Ltd Retail Network Manager, Auditor, Investigator
or other support personnel require access to the system then this will be
obtained via the process described in Section 9.3.1 Authorised-user
passwords.

Many access parameters are centrally configurable in the Horizon system’s
message store, for example session inactivity timeout and password expiry,
and are set to values defined by Post Office Counters Ltd (see Section 9.5

Centrally-configurable parameters).

4 Post Office Logon

Post Office Logon allows a member of the outlet staff to unlock the file store
of a system and gain access to the Horizon counter system. This procedure is
used in either of the following circumstances:

« When the system is first started:
e After installation (see Section 4.1 Initialisation).

e After a workstation has been replaced (see Sections 4.5 Replacement
Gateway workstation and 4.6 Replacement non-Gateway workstation).

e When a workstation processor is switched back on after being powered off
(see Section 4.2 Regaining access to a switched-off workstation).

The procedure involves the use of a memory card called a PMMC
(PostMaster’s Memory Card) and a PIN (Personal Identity Number). (Note
that the PIN is actually a string of alphanumeric characters.)

4.1 Initialisation

4.1.1

This procedure generates the key with which the filestore is locked, and
writes it to the PMMC. This procedure is performed when the system is
installed, and is therefore a one-off activity.

To undertake this procedure, the entire Horizon system should be switched
on; for further details refer to Section 6.1 Daily Horizon system start-up. The
engineer will leave the Horizon system switched on after installation.

Two PMMCs are supplied with the system. One is used in the initialisation
procedure and the other is a spare in case the first is mislaid.

Gateway workstation initialisation

The Gateway workstation is the link between the post office and the central
systems. It is the processor of this workstation that must be initialised first to
unlock the file store and gain access to the Horizon system. It will also be this
processor that needs to be used in the event of changing PINs or lost
PINs/PMMCs. The Gateway workstation will be identified as such by the
words ‘GATEWAY WORKSTATION’ displayed on the top left of the screen.

Prior to initialisation the screen will display an animated picture of a hand
inserting a card into the smart card reader with the instruction ‘Please insert
your Postmasters Memory Card (PMMC) ...’.

For details regarding the location of the smart card reader, refer to the CSR+
Operating Environment PPD [Ref. CS/PRO/097].

Both the PIN and the PMMC are required to perform this procedure. If either
the PIN record or the PMMC is unavailable, follow the procedure in Section
4.3 Lost PIN/PMMC.

Prior to initialisation, the workstation should be switched on and the screen
will display an animated picture of a hand inserting a card into the card
reader with the instruction ‘Please insert your Postmasters Memory Card
(PMMC) ...’.

If this procedure is being followed at any time other than initialisation, and
this screen is not displayed, the workstation must be shut down and switched
off (see Section 6.15 Shutting down a processor) and switched on again to
obtain this screen.

Step 1. Insert the PMMC into the reader, as the diagram on the screen
illustrates.
(The system displays the PIN Number screen.)

Step 2. The following message is displayed: ‘Please enter your PIN’.
Step 3. Enter the PIN using the keyboard.

EXCEPTION A: If the PIN cannot be entered because the keyboard is
not working:

« Telephone the Horizon System Helpdesk [HSH call POHCO9].
Step 4. Select the Proceed option.
EXCEPTION A: If the entered PIN is not accepted:
e Proceed as described in Section 4.7.2 PIN entry failures.

initialisation is complete.

Step 9. You may now log on to the Horizon system (see Section 6.2
Logon).

Step 10. Repeat steps 1 to 9 for each non-Gateway workstation to
be initialised.

Step 11. Store the PMMC in a secure location, ensuring it is
separate from the PIN record.

Step 12. Store the PIN record in a secure location, separate from
the PMMC.

4.2 Regaining access to a switched-off workstation

4.2.1

If either the PIN record or the PMMC is unavailable, follow the procedure in
Section 4.3 Lost PIN/PMMC.

If a power failure has taken all the workstations down, then access must first
be regained on the Gateway workstation. (If the Gateway workstation cannot
be started, then, provided that the PIN record and the PMMC are available,
access can be regained on the non-Gateway workstations. However, there
will no external communication with the centre.)

Regaining access to a switched-off non-Gateway workstation

The procedure to regain access to the Horizon system in the event of the
processor of a non-Gateway workstation being switched off is as follows:

Step 1. Switch on the workstation’s processor and the remaining
components of the workstation as outlined in Section 6.1 Daily
Horizon system start-up.

EXCEPTION A: If the processor and components are already
switched on (this could be the case where the power has now been
restored after a power failure):

e Proceed to step 2.

Step 2. Follow the instructions outlined in Section 4.1.2 Non-Gateway
workstation initialisation.

4.2.2 Regaining access to a switched-off Gateway workstation (contd)
Step 17. Proceed as follows:

SCENARIO A: Where only the Gateway was switched off and no new
security data was received:

« Store the PMMC in a secure location, ensuring it is separate from the PIN record.
« Store the PIN record in a secure location separate from the PMMC.
e This ends the procedure.

SCENARIO B: Where there are either other counter workstations
(non-Gateway) switched off or new security data was received:

e For each other counter workstation in turn, follow the instructions in Section
4.1.2Non-Gateway workstation initialisation

Note: If the non-Gateway workstations are not already switched
off then this may be done at a convenient time so that the post
office has minimum disruption.

4.3 Lost PIN/PMMC

This procedure must be followed in the event that a workstation is switched
off and either the PIN record or the PMMC is unavailable. Without the PIN
and PMMC, the protected filestore cannot be unlocked. The procedure in this
section describes how the Post Master and helpdesk create a new set of both
PMMC and PIN to unlock the protected filestore. No data is lost on the
counter. If, however, the old set of PMMC and PIN are subsequently found,
they will not work on the counter.

This procedure is performed at the Gateway workstation.
Note:

e Ifthe original workstation switched off was not the Gateway workstation,
then, to avoid disabling the office, this procedure can be left until a more
convenient time. This means that it will not be possible to use the affected
workstation though all others will be available.

4.5 Replacement Gateway workstation

If an engineer replaces the Gateway workstation of the Horizon system, the
procedure below should be followed.

Note: in a multi-workstation office, non-Gateway workstations may be used in
local mode (meaning that they have no communication with the external data
centres and are functioning in isolation so that only transactions that do not
require communication with the central system can be performed), until the
Gateway workstation is re-started as described below. The non-Gateway
workstations do not need to be restarted.

If the PIN record is lost, a new PIN can be generated. If the PMMC is lost, the
spare can be used. If both PMMCs are unavailable, the engineer will
telephone the Horizon System Helpdesk [HSH call SEC002].

5 System initialisation

After the Horizon system has been installed, the manager MUST perform the
system initialisation procedure. This allows the manager to set up a user
identity for themselves with manager access, after which they can create
identities for other users.

Business rules:

e All users must have been through the Horizon Service Training Event and
passed the competency test.

The set up procedure is as follows:

Step 1. Log on to the system with the user name ZSET01 and the
password FIRST1 (see Section 6.2 Logon).

Step 2. Create a user identity for yourself with manager access (see
Section 7.1.1 Adding a user: procedure).

Step 3. Log out (see Section 6.12 Logout).
Step 4. Log on as the new manager user.
Step 5. Delete the ZSET01 user (see Section 7.3 Deleting a user).

EXCEPTION A: If you are not able to delete the ZSETO1 user (that is,
you do not have manager access):

e Log out.

e Repeat steps 1 to 5, but in step 2 modify your existing user identity to give
yourself manager access (see Section 7.2.1 Modifying a user: procedure).

Step 6. Create all additional users if required (see Section 7.1.1 Adding a
user: procedure).

This section describes the following system access procedures:
e Daily Horizon system start-up.

e Logon.

« Change of password by user.

e Enforced change of password facility.
« Forgotten password.

e Session mobility.

e Temporary lock.

e Session inactivity time-out.

e Over-riding the current user.

e Forced logout.

e Logout.

« Daily Horizon system shutdown.

« Moveable outlets.

6.1 Daily Horizon system start-up

The start-up procedure for the counter system is as follows:

Step 1. Ensure the office equipment is connected to the power supply.

Step 2. Press the switch on the monitor to the ‘I’ or ‘on’ position.

Step 3. Press the switch on the counter printer to the ‘I’ or ‘on’ position.
(The reports printer need only be switched on when required.)

Note: The processor will only require switching on at the first time of
operation and if there has been reason for it to be switched off,
for example, if instructed by the Horizon System Helpdesk. In
normal circumstances, the processor will be left switched on at
all times to enable the transfer of data. No re-connection of any
cables to the system should be done by the user - excepting
ensuring that the power cable is plugged into the mains socket
and turned on. Any other reconnection of cables requires a call
to the Horizon System Helpdesk [HSH call POHC12].

If the processor is switched off by accident, the procedure
described in Section 4.2 Regaining access to a switched-off
workstation must be followed.

6.5 Forgotten password

If a clerk forgets their password, the post office manager can reset the
password (see Section 7.2.1.3 Modifying a user’s password).

If the post office manager forgets their password they can gain access to the
system via the process in Section 9.3.1 Authorised-user passwords), and
reset the password on their normal user name (see Section 7.2.1.3 Modifying
a user’s password).

6.6 Session mobility

This function allows the ability to log on at another workstation, without
having to log out at a previous one. Should the user need to switch
workstations for one reason or another, they can simply log on in the normal
fashion at another workstation. This will automatically log the user out of the
previous workstation in the normal manner. Any activities that are being
carried out will appear on the new workstation in the exact same state as on
the previous workstation.

Session mobility is not permitted in some contexts; for example, when the
system is processing a report or carrying out a critical function such as an AP
smart card transaction.

6.7 Temporary lock (user-invoked)

The temporary lock function bars access to the system. A user can invoke a
temporary session lock at any time by navigating to the Serve Customer
menu, selecting the Functions option and then the Temporary Lock option. A
user logon screen is displayed saying that the session is currently locked by
nn (user’s name) and that the user’s password needs to be entered to unlock
the screen [Message NS_TRState_ENG:msgStationLockedBy].

The user can re-activate the workstation as follows:
Step 1. Select the Tick option to accept the user name displayed.

Step 2. Enter the password and select the Tick option.
(The system displays the Transactions, Functions menu.)

SCENARIO A: If the password entered is incorrect, the system says
that an invalid name or password had been supplied [Message
NS_TRState_ENG:/gninvalidLogon]:

e Select the Tick option.
(The system re-displays the Username screen.)

e Select the Password field and re-enter the password.
e This ends the procedure.

Note: if another user wishes to over-ride the current user, they may do so in
the way described in Section 6.9 Over-riding the current user.

6.8 Session inactivity time-out (system-invoked)

A session is timed-out after a period of inactivity (that is, whereby there has
been no input from any of the peripherals) of a pre-configured time (see
Section 9.5 Centrally-configurable parameters). After this time, a user logon
screen is displayed saying that the session is currently locked by that user
and that the user’s password needs to be entered to unlock the screen
[Message NS_TRState_ENG:msgStationLockedBy].

The user can re-activate the workstation in the same way as described in
Section 6.7 Temporary lock (user-invoked). If another user wishes to override
the current user, they can do so in the way described in Section 6.9 Over-
riding the current user.

If the user that is logged on is one who is operating via an authorised-user
password (see Section 9.3.1 Authorised-user passwords) then, when the
procedure in Section 6.7 Temporary lock (user-invoked) is followed, step 2
Scenario A will apply. They will need to obtain another authorised-user
password, via the process in Section 9.3.1 Authorised-user passwords, in
order to de-activate the inactivity lock.

6.9 Over-riding the current user

The facility to over-ride the current user is available to all types of user. If,
whilst the user logon screen is displayed with a message saying that the
session is currently locked by user nn [Message
NS_TRState_ENG:msgStationLockedBy], another user wishes to log on, they
can over-ride the current user. To do this they must delete the user name
displayed and enter their own user name and password.

The system displays the Logout User screen and a message asking the new
user whether they are sure that they wish to log the current user out, and
telling them that any outstanding transactions will be committed [Message
NS_TRState_ENG:IgnTransMayLost]. If the user selects the Tick option, the
system commits any outstanding transactions using cash as the method of
payment, logs the current user out and re-displays the initial screen with the
Riposte logo in the centre of the screen. The new user must log in again as
described in Section 6.2 Logon. If the user selects the Cross option, the
system re-displays the Username screen with the current user’s user name
displayed in the username field.

If the current user is logged out, the system does not produce a receipt.
When a new user logs on again after over-riding the current user, the Reprint
Receipt function can be used to produce a session receipt showing the
transactions committed.

6.10 User logged on at a crashed counter

If a counter crashes, the user attached to the counter cannot be attached to a
new stock unit as the system believes that the user is still logged on at the
crashed counter. If this happens, the user should log on and off at another
counter. (The session is lost and any uncommitted transactions will have to
be re-entered.)

If the user in question has left the office, their stock unit remains active as
they have not logged off. This will inhibit the stock balance of a shared stock
unit, and can cause other problems. In this case, the manager should change
the user’s password and then log on and off as that user.

6.11 Forced logout

If there is a further period of inactivity of a pre-configured time (see Section
9.5 Centrally-configurable parameters) after a session has timed-out and the
user logon screen has appeared, the system forces a permanent logout. This
results in the user being logged out, and the Riposte logo appearing in the
centre of the screen.

After a forced logout, any customer session currently in progress, including a
suspended session, is committed against cash. The system does not produce
a receipt. When a user logs on again after a forced logout, the Reprint
Receipt function can be used to produce a session receipt showing the
transactions committed.

If the session is not a customer session, settlement is against the appropriate
settlement product. The system produces a receipt if the session is of the
type where an automatic receipt is printed (for example, remittances or
transfers).

If the user leaves the Horizon system without completing a transaction, the
system will progress through the following sequence of events leading to a
forced logout:

e Inthe period prior to the inactivity timeout being invoked, the screen and
system remain active allowing the user to return and progress the
transaction in the normal manner.

e Inthe period after the inactivity timeout has been invoked and prior to the
forced logout being invoked, the user will be locked out of the system
under the ‘Temporary Lock’ condition. The user should enter their
password to return to the position at which the lock-out occurred and the
transaction can be progressed in the normal manner. If the user is subject
to a forced password change during this process, the standard procedure
should be followed (see Section 6.4 Enforced change of password facility)
and the new password will then allow access to the transaction.

e Another user can log the original user out of the Temporary Lock at any
time (see Section 6.9 Over-riding the current user) and the transaction will
be completed as ‘PAID’, that is:

An OBCS book receipt, book issue or redirection transaction is
completed; and all records for an OBCS encashment for which the
value had been entered will show that the customer has received
the value of one or more foils.

APS and EPOSS transactions will be committed.

e When the pre-configured time for forced logout has elapsed, the user will
be forcibly logged out of the system and the transaction will be completed
as ‘PAID’ automatically by the system, that is:

An OBCS book receipt, book issue or redirection transaction is
completed; and all records for an OBCS encashment for which the
value had been entered will show that the customer has received
the value of one or more foils.

themselves may be reversed (providing they are defined in
reference data as being reversible). See the CSR+ APS PPD [Ref.
CS/PRO/091] and the CSR+ EPOSS PPD [Ref.CS/PRO/095] for
information on reversing transactions.

6.12 Logout

This function is used to log out a user from a system workstation. The
workstation will then be in a ready state for another user to log on or, if at the
end of the day, for the daily Horizon system shutdown procedure (see Section
6.13 Daily Horizon system shutdown) to take place.

The procedure to log out is as follows:

Step 1. From the Desktop, select the Logout option. The system
prompts you to confirm that you want to log out [Message
NS_TRState_ENG:IgnLogoutCertainCaption].

Step 2. To confirm the logout, select the Tick option.
(The system displays the initial screen with the Riposte logo in the
centre of the screen.)

EXCEPTION A: If you do not want to log out:

e Select the Cross option.
(The system returns to the Desktop.)

e This ends the procedure.

6.13 Daily Horizon system shutdown

6.14 Moveable outlets

A moveable outlet is an outlet that has no fixed counter but provides service
to customers from largely private dwellings. In such outlets, the Horizon
system counter position is provided on a trolley.

The trolley is operated from a location called a point of service and stored in
a secure location called a point of storage. The point of service and the point
of storage may be at the same or different locations. This affects the
operation of the trolley as follows:

e Single operation location trolley: Where the points of service and
storage are at the same locations, the start-up and shutdown procedures
are as for a fixed counter position (see Sections 6.1 Daily Horizon system
Start-up, and 6.13 Daily Horizon system shutdown).

e Dual operation location trolley: Where the points of service and storage
are at different locations, since the trolley has no electrical power supply
when being moved between them, the user has to shut down the Horizon
System and power off the equipment as described in Sections 6.14.1
Moving a trolley from its point of service to its point of storage and 6.14.2
Moving a trolley from its point of storage to its point of service below. It
should be powered on at all other times.

Business rule:

e To ensure that the end-of-day activities take place correctly, the trolley’s
communications cable must be connected by 19:00. This can be at either
the point of service or the point of storage.

Note: If there is a need to move the trolley between 19:00 and 20:00, this
must be done as swiftly as possible.
6.14.1 Moving a trolley from its point of service to its point of storage

The procedure to move a dual operation location trolley from its point of
service to its point of storage is as follows:

Step 1. Shut down and switch off the workstation’s processor as
described in Section 6.15 Shutting down a processor.

Step 2. Switch off the office printer, counter printer and monitor.
Step 3. Switch off the power outlet.

Step 4. Disconnect the trolley from its power and communications
points.

Step 5. Park the power and communications cables in their docking
point on the trolley.

Step 6. Release the trolley’s brakes.

7 User administration

User administration consists of maintaining the identities of users on the
system. A user identity consists of a user name, full name, password and
group as follows:

e User name: This consists of six specific characters as defined in
Section 9.1 User names.

e Full name: This consists of two fields, the user’s first and last name.
Standards for full names are described in Section 9.2 Full names.

e Password: This is specified by the user and prevents unauthorised
access. Standards for passwords are described in Section 9.3 Passwords.

e Group: This determines the functions available to the user according to
their role. Further information on groups is given in Section 9.4 Groups.

Business rule:
e An additional component of a user identity, called a Teller Id, is not used.
System rule:

e Only users with manager access rights are allowed to add, modify and
delete users.

The following processes and procedures are described:
e Adding a user

e Modifying a user

e Deleting a user

A report function is available that lists all the users associated with the post
office, together with their groups (see Section 8.1 User Summary report).

(To review the other components of a user identity, the user name can be
identified as described in Section 8.1.1 Printing a User Summary report and
then viewed using the Modify User function.)

9 Data input rules

This section gives the standards to which user names, full names and
passwords must conform and describes the way in which groups allow access
to the system.

9.1 User names

User names must conform to the following standards:

e System rules:

e Each user name must be unique within a post office. This relates to
all users added to the system, including any subsequently deleted.

e A.user name cannot contain spaces or more than two successive
duplicate characters.

e Auser name must be six characters long.

e Business rules:

Notes:
e The

e Auser’s user name consists of six characters in the following
format: first initial, first two letters of the user’s surname, three
numeric characters (always 001 unless there is more then one
occurrence of the user name). For example, the first Elvis Presley to
be described to the system within a post office would have the user
name EPRO01. Ella Presley, or a second Elvis Presley, would
appear as EPROO2.

If using the user’s first initial and the first two letters of the user’s
surname gives more than two successive duplicate characters, the
third duplicate character (second from the surname) should be
omitted and the third character from the surname should be used
instead. For example, Linda Llewellyn would appear as LLEO01.

If the next numeric character in the current sequence leads to three
repeated characters, the third duplicate character should be omitted
and the next number in the sequence used instead. For example,
the number 111 would be omitted and the number 112 used instead.

user name uniquely identifies the user to the system, and must be

used every time the user logs on.

e Itis solely for the designated person’s use; users must NOT allow others to

use

it.

e Users must not use, or attempt to use any user name that has not been
explicitly issued to themselves.

9.2 Full names

Full names must conform to the following standards:

e System rules:

At least one character must be entered in each of the fields.
The system does not allow the entry of more than one first name.
No spaces can be committed to the first name field.

The maximum number of characters that can be entered is 16. This
is character dependent - wider characters (W for example) will take
up more space, narrower characters (I for example) will take up less
space.

e Business rules:

If a name is too long to fit in the displayed box, it should be
truncated when it reaches the end point.

The names cannot be changed after the user has been set up.

9.3 Passwords

Passwords for users must conform to the following standards:

e System rules:

A password cannot be the same as the user name.

Passwords must not use the words detailed in a list of excluded
words defined by POCL Product Management. This list contains
obvious words such as PASSWORD and SECRET, and names.

A password cannot contain spaces or more than two successive
duplicate characters.

A password must be at least 6 characters and no more than 14
characters.

A password must be changed immediately if it has been allocated
by someone else, i.e. when the user is first introduced to the
system, the password is modified or when ‘Must Change Password’
is set on.

A user cannot change their password more than once within a pre-
configured duration (see Section 9.5 Centrally-configurable
parameters).

Passwords will expire according to a pre-configured duration (see
Section 9.5 Centrally-configurable parameters).

9.3.1

e Passwords can only be reused after a pre-configured number of
password changes have elapsed (see Section 9.5 Centrally-
configurable parameters).

« Business rules:
e A password must contain letters and numbers, at least one of each.

e A.user’s initial password is to be known only by the person creating
the user and the new user. Subsequent passwords must be known
only the user and must not be revealed to anybody else.

Generally users must:

e Ensure their password is private, user selected, and not revealed to
anyone.

e Not write down their password.

« Change their password immediately if they believe it may be known to
someone else.

e Ensure they are not observed when entering or changing their password.
Notes:

e For security, passwords are not displayed on the screen; instead each
character of the password is shown as an ‘X’ as described in the CSR+
Operating Environment PPD [Ref. CS/PRO/0097].

e For along password, more characters can be entered when the
alphanumeric screenpad is used. However, if more characters are entered
than will fit in the input field when using the keyboard, this will constrain
the user to always use the alphanumeric screenpad when logging on.

e Noone should ask a user for their password, not even the Horizon System
Helpdesk. Any such request for information should be reported to the
normal Post Office Counters Ltd security channels.

Authorised-user passwords

An authorised-user password is granted to verified users and allows access
to the system for one session only.

The procedure to obtain an authorised-user password is detailed in the POCL
‘Authorised-user Password Procedure’ which describes how the user obtains
authorisation from the Network Business Support Centre and how the Horizon
System Helpdesk and the user interact [HSH call SEC003].

Authorised-user passwords are not linked to groups but to user names. The
user names to which authorised-user passwords apply are shown in Section
9.4.1 User names and passwords for groups.

9.4 Groups

The rules that apply to groups are given below. Details of the user names and
passwords assigned to groups are given in the following subsections.

Rules that are not enforced by the system:
e A.user should be a member of not more than or less than one group.
System rules:

« Auser can be a member of one or more than one group. The functions
available on the menus are determined by the access rights available to
the group(s) selected. The functions available to the highest level group
selected will be available to the user, plus any other functions which are
otherwise specific to any other particular group that is also selected.

« The system supports the following groups:

e ENGINEER: This group will not affect counter operations; it has only
diagnostic capability.

e AUDITOR: This group has access to limited functionality which
supports the auditing process.

e AUDITOR E: This group has full manager rights plus access to final
accounting facilities, and is only required in emergency situations,
should another employee need to take over the post office.

e SUPPORT: This group has only administrative functionality to
create users, for instance a new manager. It is used if the manager
forgets their password.

e MANAGERS: This group allows all access to all functions. User
administration is restricted to this group.

e SUPERVISORS: This group has access to all counter and some
administrative functionality.

e CLERK: This group has access to all the counter functionality.

e SETUP: This group operates only on initialisation of the system.
The only rights this group has are administrative ones in order to
create a manager user. Once this has been completed, the group
must be deleted.

e Groups not appropriate to outlet users (ENGINEER, AUDITOR,
AUDITOR E, SUPPORT and SETUP) cannot be allocated to new or
existing users. These groups can only be assigned by the system start-up
process for agreed user names.

10 Security guidelines

The following security guidelines should be followed:

e Any misuse of the system could lead to an offence under the Computer
Misuse and/or Data Protection Acts.

e Users are accountable for any actions undertaken with their user name
and password.

e Users are responsible for ensuring that their password is kept private and
not revealed to anybody else.

e Redundant users must be deleted from the system.

e Any breach of security into the Horizon system should be reported to the
Horizon System Helpdesk [HSH call SECO007].

« All existing security checks must still be applied (the system does not do
away with the need for vigilance).

e Features of the system, especially security, must be treated as business
sensitive information, and not discussed outside the workplace.

« Screens should not be placed so that they can be seen by customers.

e Users must invoke the temporary lock or log out from the system if the
workstation is out of their sight, or if they are not going to use it
immediately.

11 Fallback procedures

The following types of equipment failure will affect administrative activities:
e Ifthe counter printer fails:

« A Post Office Logon PIN can be noted on paper (see Section 4.7.1
Counter printer failure).

e Reports can be printed when the service is resumed or, for a multi-
counter office, at another counter position.

e Ifthe monitor or PC fails, no administrative activities will be possible until
the service is resumed in a single-counter office. For a multi-counter office,
another counter position can be used.

e Ifthe monitor fails, the keyboard is still active. Touching keys on the
keyboard may result in undesired activities taking place.

For the fallback procedure for keyboard or touch screen failure, see the
CSR+ Operating Environment PPD [Ref. CS/PRO/097].
