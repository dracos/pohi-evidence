101.5 Rights and Remedies of the AUTHORITIES under the
Related Agreements

101.5.1 The rights and remedies of each AUTHORITY
against the CONTRACTOR under the AUTHORITIES’ Agreement are
concurrent and may be exercised concurrently or separately
by either AUTHORITY with or without the consent of the
other AUTHORITY.

101.5.2 Except as provided by Clause 101.5.4, the
rights and remedies of DSS against the CONTRACTOR under the
DSS Agreement are not concurrent with those of POCL and may
only be exercised by DSS.

101.5.3 Except as provided by Clause 101.5.5, the rights
and remedies of POCL against the CONTRACTOR under the POCL
Agreement are not concurrent with those of DSS and may only
be exercised by POCL.

101.5.4 If in the event of Default by the CONTRACTOR
under the DSS Agreement, DSS elects not to exercise any of
its rights and remedies against the CONTRACTOR under that
Agreement, such rights and remedies shall be exercisable
against the CONTRACTOR by POCL in DSS’s name within three
(3) months of such election as if POCL were DSS and the
CONTRACTOR shall be liable to POCL as if POCL were DSS,
provided that POCL has suffered or risks suffering direct
loss or damage as a result of such Default which is not
remediable under the POCL Agreement and provided, further,
that the POCL Agreement has not been terminated. In any
such action, the CONTRACTOR shall be entitled to the same
substantive defences and procedural rights and remedies
against POCL as it would have had against DSS if such
action were brought by DSS (including the right to obtain
discovery from POCL and DSS of those documents in relation
to which the CONTRACTOR would have had a right of discovery
if the action had been brought by DSS) in addition to those
it is entitled to against POCL itself. However, POCL shall
not be entitled to exercise DSS’s rights and remedies
against the CONTRACTOR under the DSS Agreement (a) without
first having consulted fully with DSS, or (b) where DSS has
settled its own claim against the CONTRACTOR in respect of
such Default and POCL has approved such settlement. POCL
shall promptly notify the CONTRACTOR in writing of its
approval of such settlement.

RESTRICTED - CONTRACTS

101.5.5 If in the event of Default by the CONTRACTOR
under the POCL Agreement POCL elects not to exercise its
rights and remedies against the CONTRACTOR under that
Agreement, such rights and remedies shall be exercisable
against the CONTRACTOR by DSS in POCL’s name within three
(3) months of such election as if DSS were POCL and the
CONTRACTOR shall be liable to DSS as if DSS were POCL,
provided that DSS has suffered or risks suffering direct
loss or damage as a result of such Default which is not
remediable under the DSS Agreement and provided, further,
that the DSS Agreement has not been terminated. In any
such action, the CONTRACTOR shall be entitled to the same
substantive defences and procedural rights and remedies
against DSS as it would have had against POCL if such
action were brought by POCL (including the right to obtain
discovery from DSS and POCL of those documents in relation
to which the CONTRACTOR would have had a right of discovery
if the action had been brought by POCL) in addition to
those it is entitled to against DSS itself. However, DSS
shall not be entitled to exercise POCL’s rights and
remedies under the POCL Agreement (a) without first having
consulted fully with POCL, or (b) where POCL has settled
its own claim against the CONTRACTOR in respect of such
Default and DSS has approved such settlement. DSS shall
promptly notify the CONTRACTOR in writing of its approval
of such settlement.

101.5.6 The CONTRACTOR shall not be liable to either
AUTHORITY for any failure to perform or delay in performing
any of its obligations to that AUTHORITY under the Related
Agreements where the CONTRACTOR proves that such failure or
delay has been directly caused by the failure of either
AUTHORITY to perform any of the obligations applicable to
that AUTHORITY or to both AUTHORITIES under the Related
Agreements. This Clause shall not apply to Clause 808,
which shall be governed by the specific rule stated in
Clause 808.2.

101.5.7 Before settling any claim by it under the
Related Agreements, the relevant AUTHORITY shall first
consult fully with the other AUTHORITY. Settlement by

either AUTHORITY of a claim by it against the CONTRACTOR
under the Related Agreements shall protect the CONTRACTOR
from the other AUTHORITY making a claim in respect of the
same Default, provided that such AUTHORITY has approved
such settlement. The AUTHORITY approving such settlement
shall promptly notify the CONTRACTOR in writing of such
approval.

101.6 Obligations and Liabilities of the AUTHORITIES under
the Related Agreements

101.6.1 For the avoidance of doubt, the parties
acknowledge that nothing in the Related Agreements shall
be deemed or construed to create a partnership between the
AUTHORITIES, and neither AUTHORITY shall be jointly or
severally liable for any of the obligations of the other
AUTHORITY under the Related Agreements.

101.6.2 Without limitation to Clause 101.6.1, where any
obligation under the Related Agreements is expressed to be
binding on both AUTHORITIES, such obligation will be
binding on each AUTHORITY individually and one AUTHORITY
shall not be liable for any failure by the other AUTHORITY
to comply with that obligation.

Clause 102. Interpretations

102.1 As used in the AUTHORITIES’ Agreement:

102.1.1 the terms and expressions set out in
Schedule Al shall have the meanings ascribed therein;

102.1.2 the masculine includes the feminine and the
neuter; and

102.1.3 the singular includes the plural and vice
versa.

102.2 A reference to any statute, enactment, order,
regulation or other similar instrument shall be construed
as a reference to the statute, enactment, order, regulation
or instrument as amended by any subsequent statute,
enactment, order, regulation or instrument or as contained
in any subsequent re-enactment thereof.

102.3 Headings are included in the AUTHORITIES’ Agreement
for ease of reference only and shall not affect the
interpretation or construction of the AUTHORITIES’

Agreement.
102.4 References in this AUTHORITIES' Agreement to Clauses,
Parts, Annexes and Schedules are, unless otherwise

provided, references to the clauses, parts, annexes and
schedules of the AUTHORITIES’ Agreement.

102.5 In the event and to the extent only of any conflict
or inconsistency between the Clauses and Schedule Al and
the Schedules (other than Schedule Al), the Clauses and
Schedule Al shall prevail. In the event and to the extent
only of any conflict or inconsistency between the Schedules
(other than Schedule Al), the provisions of Schedules 2, A2

AUTHORITIES VERSION 5.0 15 May 1996
FUJ00119560
FUJ00119560

RESTRICTED - CONTRACTS

to Al2, B3, B7 and B8 shall prevail over those of all other
Schedules (other than Schedule Al) and the provisions of
Schedules Bl and B4 shall prevail over those of Schedules
B2 and B5. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if and only to
the extent that Schedule 3 expressly states that a
particular requirement in Schedule Bl and B4 will be met by
Schedules B2 and BS in a particular form, manner or
quantity, or at a particular time or place, the provisions
of Schedule 3 will prevail. Moreover, for the avoidance of
doubt, the AUTHORITIES acknowledge that a particular
solution in Schedules B2 or BS shall not be treated as
being in conflict or inconsistent with any requirement in
Schedule Bl or B4 merely because the solution states that
the requirement will be met in a particular form, manner,
quantity, time or place.

102.6 The Recitals are not legally binding, but are
intended as a guide to the interpretation and construction
of the AUTHORITIES’ Agreement.

Clause 103. Severability

If any provision of the AUTHORITIES’ Agreement is held
invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason by any
court or regulatory body of competent jurisdiction, such
provision shall be severed and the remainder of the
provisions hereof shall continue in full force and effect
as if the AUTHORITIES’ Agreement had been executed with the
invalid illegal or unenforceable provision eliminated. In
the event of a holding of invalidity so fundamental as to
prevent the accomplishment of the purpose of the
AUTHORITIES’ Agreement, the AUTHORITIES and the CONTRACTOR
shall immediately commence good faith negotiations to
remedy such invalidity. However, if the AUTHORITIES and
the CONTRACTOR fail to conclude such negotiations within a
reasonable period of time, the AUTHORITIES’ Agreement shall
terminate without further liability to any party (subject
to Clause 902.7).

Clause 104. Law and Jurisdiction

104.1 The AUTHORITIES’ Agreement shall be considered as a
contract made in England and according to English Law and,
subject to Clause 807, shall be subject to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the English Courts to which the parties
hereby submit.

104.2 Except as specified in Clause 101, the AUTHORITIES’
Agreement is binding on the relevant AUTHORITIES and their

AUTHORITIES VERSION 5.0 15 May 1996
FUJ00119560
FUJ00119560

RESTRICTED - CONTRACTS

successors and permitted assignees and on the CONTRACTOR
and the CONTRACTOR's successors and permitted assignees.

Clause 105. Entire Agreement

The Related Agreements constitute the entire understanding
between the parties relating to the subject matter of the
Related Agreements and, save as may be expressly referred
to or referenced herein, supersede all prior
representations, agreements, negotiations or understandings
with respect thereto, whether oral or in writing, except in
respect of any fraudulent misrepresentation made by any
party.

Clause 106. General Principles

106.1 The CONTRACTOR will not have the right to seek and
arrange for the Card to be used in retail outlets other
than in post offices and DSS offices in normal
circumstances.

106.2 The CONTRACTOR shall deliver and continue to provide
a secure system in respect of all transactions which as far
as the Related Agreements require eliminates the potential
for benefit payment fraud and any other fraud or
unauthorised disclosure of data and provides pro-active
detection processes and significant barriers to attacks
from internal conspiracy and collusion to defraud the
AUTHORITIES.

106.3 The Services and the Service Infrastructure shall be
capable of introduction in all post offices.

PART 2 : PERFORMANCE OF SERVICES AND SUPPLY OF PRODUCTS

Clause 201. Performance of Services

201.1 Until transposed in accordance with Clauses 201.4 and
201.5, the CONTRACTOR shall be responsible for meeting the
requirements specified in Schedule Bl in the manner
specified in Schedule B2 by performing the Services to be
more particularly described in the relevant Schedules of
the DSS Agreement and the POCL Agreement. The AUTHORITIES
shall perform at their own cost and expense the AUTHORITIES
Responsibilities listed in Schedules B2 and B5 and as
otherwise expressly specified herein, and shall use all
reasonable endeavours to perform such AUTHORITY
Responsibilities in accordance with any agreed timetable
specified in Schedule B7 or elsewhere herein. However, for
the avoidance of doubt, and subject to Clause 102.5, the

AUTHORITIES VERSION 5.0 15 May 1996
FUJ00119560

RESTRICTED - CONTRACTS

parties acknowledge that the AUTHORITIES’ acceptance of the
CONTRACTOR’s solutions in Schedule B2 and B5, and their
agreement to the service descriptions contained in the
relevant Schedules of the DSS Agreement and the POCL
Agreement, shall not relieve the CONTRACTOR of its
obligation to meet the requirements specified in Schedules
Bl and B4, as modified by Schedule 3.

201.2 To support the performance of the Services, the
CONTRACTOR shall supply the Service Architecture Design
Document in accordance with Schedules Bl and B2 and all
other applicable provisions hereof.

201.3 The CONTRACTOR shall be responsible for meeting the
Double Key Requirements specified in Schedule B4 in the
manner specified in Schedule B5 by performing the Services
to be more particularly described in the relevant Schedules
of the DSS Agreement and the POCL Agreement.

201.4 Schedule Bl and Schedule B2 shall cease to have
effect from three (3) months after execution of the
AUTHORITIES’ Agreement, provided that Schedules Bl and B2
shall have been

(a) clarified pursuant to Clause 201.10; and

(b) transposed and/or extrapolated to the relevant
Schedules of the Related Agreements as specified in
Schedule 2.

The foregoing process of clarification, transposition and
extrapolation shall not add to the CONTRACTOR’s obligations
under the Related Agreements as at the date hereof. Any
variation (including additions, reductions and
modifications) to the CONTRACTOR’s obligations under the
Related Agreements arising out of such clarification,
transposition and extrapolation may only be made in
accordance with Clause 101.3.

201.5 Schedule B3 shall cease to have effect three (3)
months after execution of the AUTHORITIES’ Agreement,
provided that Schedule B3 shall have been extrapolated into
the relevant Schedules of the POCL Agreement and of the DSS
Agreement as specified in Schedule 2. The foregoing
process of extrapolation shall not add to the CONTRACTOR’s
obligations under the Related Agreements as at the date
hereof. Any addition to the CONTRACTOR’s obligations under
the Related Agreements arising out of such extrapolation
may only be made in accordance with Clause 101.3.

201.6 Schedules 3, A6, B4, BS, B7, B8 and C5 shall be
extrapolated into the relevant Schedules of the Related
Agreements as specified in Schedule 2, but shall still have

of the delay. The CONTRACTOR shall notify the AUTHORITIES
in writing within three (3) working days of becoming aware
of such Default.

605.2.2 If the performance of the AUTHORITIES’ Agreement
by any party be delayed by reason of any force majeure

happening or non-happening will only be considered Force
Majeure if it is not attributable to the wilful act,
neglect or failure to take reasonable precautions of the
affected party, its agents or employees, and only if a
substitute third party is not reasonably available (having
regard, without limitation, to the cost and quality of such
substitute) to perform the affected obligation. In no
event shall any fraudulent act or omission by any party or
third party relating to the Services hereunder for which
the CONTRACTOR is liable under Clause 808 constitute Force
Majeure.

605.3.2 No party hereto shall in any circumstances be
liable to any other party hereto for any loss of any kind
whatsoever including but not limited to any damages or
abatement of Charges whether directly or indirectly caused
to or incurred by the other party by reason of any failure
or delay in the performance of its obligations under the
AUTHORITIES’ Agreement which is due to Force Majeure.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party shall use all
reasonable endeavours to continue to perform, or resume
performance of, such obligations under the AUTHORITIES’
Agreement for the duration of such Force Majeure event. In
the case of the CONTRACTOR, the parties shall agree an
orderly process for such continuation or resumption of
performance (such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld
or delayed), and the CONTRACTOR shall comply with such
process.

605.3.3 If the CONTRACTOR shall become aware of
circumstances of Force Majeure which give rise to or which
are likely to give rise to any such failure or delay on its
part it shall forthwith notify the other parties within one
(1) working day and shall inform the other parties of the
period which it is estimated that such failure or delay
shall continue. If either AUTHORITY shall become aware of
circumstances of Force Majeure which give rise to any such
failure or delay on its part, it shall forthwith notify the
other parties within one (1) working day and shall inform
the other parties of the period which it is estimated that
such failure or delay shall continue.

605.3.4 It is expressly agreed that any failure by the
CONTRACTOR to perform, or any delay by the CONTRACTOR in
performing, its obligations under the AUTHORITIES’

Agreement which results from any failure or delay in the
performance of its obligations by any person, firm or
company with which the CONTRACTOR shall have entered into
any contract, supply arrangement or sub-contract or
otherwise shall be regarded as a failure or delay due to
Force Majeure only in the event that such person firm or

substitute) to perform the affected obligation.

605.3.5 [Not used]

605.3.6 If any Force Majeure event prevents any party
from performing its obligations hereunder for a period in

after consultation with the CONTRACTOR and taking into
account the CONTRACTOR’s views jointly terminate the
AUTHORITIES’ Agreement in accordance with Clause 902.1.4.

605.4 Time of the Essence

Where the AUTHORITIES after undue delay by the CONTRACTOR
notify the CONTRACTOR that time is of the essence of the
AUTHORITIES’ Agreement and any of its obligations stated in
such notice shall not have been performed by the CONTRACTOR
by any reasonable date stated in the notice, the
AUTHORITIES may terminate the AUTHORITIES’ Agreement in
accordance with Clause 902.2.3. In relation to the
timescales specified herein. The AUTHORITIES may only give
notice making time of the essence in relation to timescales
specified herein as “contractual milestones”.

605.5 Political Risk

605.5.1 Notwithstanding the provisions of Clause 605.3,
a change of, or new, Governmental Regulation:

(a) shall not excuse the AUTHORITIES from performing
their obligations to meet any minimum revenue
guarantees applicable under Schedule A6 and, without
limitation to the foregoing, if the due date for the
application of such minimum revenue guarantees (or
any agreed extension thereof) is delayed directly as
a result of any change in, or new, Governmental
Regulation, the AUTHORITIES agree to meet such
minimum revenue guarantees from the date when they
would have become payable but for such change in, or
new, Governmental Regulation;

(b) shall not entitle the AUTHORITIES to terminate the
AUTHORITIES’ Agreement under Clause 605.3.6, and any
such purported termination shall be treated as a

by reason of any infringement or alleged infringement
(including but not limited to the defence of such alleged

Property Right by the use or possession of the Products,
Services hereunder or Service Architecture by or on behalf

CONTRACTOR exclusive control of any such litigation and
such negotiations. The CONTRACTOR shall consult with and
pay due regard to the interests (including the commercial

to any claim or demand hereunder, and shall, where it is
reasonable to do so, comply with such interests and views.

may apply. The CONTRACTOR shall reimburse the AUTHORITIES
for all costs and expenses (including but not limited to
legal costs and disbursements on a solicitor and client
basis) incurred in so doing.

805.5 The AUTHORITIES shall not make any admissions which
may be prejudicial to the defence or settlement of any
claim, demand or action for infringement or alleged
infringement of any Intellectual Property Right to which
Clause 805.1 may apply or any claim or demand made or
action brought against the CONTRACTOR to which Clause 805.2
may apply.

805.6 If a claim or demand is made or action brought to
which Clause 805.1 may apply or in the reasonable opinion
of the CONTRACTOR is likely to be made or brought, the
CONTRACTOR may at its own expense either:

805.6.1 modify any or all of the Products, the
Service Architecture or the Services hereunder
without reducing the performance and functionality of
the same, or substitute alternative products, service
architecture or services of equivalent performance
and functionality for any or all of the Products, the
Service Architecture or the Services hereunder, so as
to avoid the infringement or the alleged infringement
but without disrupting the performance of the
Services hereunder, provided that the terms herein
shall apply mutatis mutandis to such modified or
substituted items or services and such modified or
substituted items shall be acceptable to the
AUTHORITIES (whether by passing any form of
acceptance testing or otherwise), such acceptance not
to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and shall
reimburse the AUTHORITIES’ all reasonable costs
directly incurred by them; or

805.6.2 procure a licence to use the Products,
Service Architecture and Services hereunder on terms
which afford to the AUTHORITIES no more extensive
rights than those originally applicable hereunder and
which are acceptable to the AUTHORITIES, and shall
reimburse the AUTHORITIES’ all reasonable costs
directly incurred by them.

805.7 The foregoing provisions of this Clause 805 shall not
apply insofar as any such claim or demand or action is in
respect of:

805.7.1 any use by or on behalf of the AUTHORITIES
of the Products, the Service Architecture or Services
hereunder in combination with any item not supplied

or approved (such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) by the CONTRACTOR where such use
of the Products, Service Architecture or Services
hereunder directly gives rise to the claim, demand or
action; or

805.7.2 any modification carried out by or on behalf
of the AUTHORITIES to any item supplied by the
CONTRACTOR under the AUTHORITIES’ Agreement if such
modification is not authorised by the CONTRACTOR in
writing; or

805.7.3 any use by the AUTHORITIES of the Products,
Service Architecture or Services hereunder in a
manner not reasonably to be inferred from the
specification or requirements of the AUTHORITIES.

805.8 If the CONTRACTOR has availed itself of its rights to
modify the Products, Service Architecture or the Services
hereunder or to supply substitute products, service
architecture or services pursuant to Clause 805.6.1 (or the
AUTHORITIES have unreasonably withheld their acceptance of
such substitute products, service architecture or Services)
or to procure a licence under Clause 805.6.2 and such
exercise of the said rights has avoided any claim, demand
or action for infringement or alleged infringement, or if
the AUTHORITIES have unreasonably withheld their acceptance
of any items modified or substituted by the CONTRACTOR in
accordance with Clause 805.6, then the CONTRACTOR shall
have no further liability thereafter under this Clause 805
in respect of the said claim, demand or action.

805.9 If a modification or substitution in accordance with
Clause 805.6.1 above is not possible so as to avoid the
infringement and the CONTRACTOR has been unable to procure
a licence in accordance with Clause 805.6.2 Clause 805.1
shall apply.

805.10The AUTHORITIES hereby warrant and represent that any
instructions given in relation to the CONTRACTOR's use of
any third party item supplied directly or indirectly by the

third party's Intellectual Property Rights in such item.
The AUTHORITIES shall, to the extent reasonably possible,
assign to the CONTRACTOR any indemnity in their favour in
relation to the Intellectual Property Rights in such third
party items.

805.11The foregoing states the entire liability of the

808.2 Except as otherwise specified in Schedule B8 in
relation to benefit payment, Clause 808.1 shall not apply
