L0G : The following information has been gent to me via Email from Ibrahim @ NBSC

Wednesday 12/12 the BM stock unit had a gain of £465.73. As this stock unit rolled over it was forced to clear local suspense
k1083.76- . The gain of £465.73 did not go to local suspense and is not included in the £1083.76-.
this was not the last stock unit to roll over. The last stock unit to roll over was MIS at 10:20 on 13/12. This stock unit had no
Idiscrepancies. MIS is a correction stock unit and was not inactive as it is rolled every BP.

IThe suspense account and final balances corroborate the above as the offi

ce has sent us copies.

[the Trading statement agrees with the suspense account and that BM stock cleared suspense but did not send its gain to suspense.
[fhe Trading position line should always show zero. Under the BM stock column it shows £465.73-.

It have had a trial done on BM stock to see if this is showing the £465.73 but it is not.

tocal suspense had to be cleared from stock unit BM because it was the last active stock unit (MIS had not been rolled over, but
as marked as inactive because it hadn't been used during the balance period).

[fhe stock unit was being balanced at 7pm at night, and, at the point where the stock unit gain should have been written to local
suspense, there was some contention with the End Of Day processes which were running in the background, and the messages were not
feritten.

[this is very unusual (we have never seen it before, and it is not an area that has changed recently). A call PC0152376 has been
sent to development to investigate why this happened and how it can be avoided in future.

tthe branch, the loss for TP 8 was £465.73 bigger than it should have been. The loss (£1083.76) was written off to Pel. As I
lunderstand it, this means the branch is not personally out of pocket, and there is no need to attempt to correct anything at the
branch. The BTS shows a trading position of -£465.73.

there is no carried forward impact on the branch accounts from this problem.

[there is however an impact on POLFS, since £465.73 (the gain which wasn't shifted to local suspense and then cleared) is still
eld in article 2064 / account 539590. I think this needs to be moved (journalised?) to write-off Pél article AABQ / account
250503.

SU, please inform POL of this problem via BIMS. I'm happy to discuss further or provide additional information, for example the
Iss, if required.
