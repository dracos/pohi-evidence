Processes and Procedures (PPD)

3.1

INTRODUCTION

This document contains the elements of the Order Book Control Service
(OBCS), applicable to Release 1b, together with parts of the existing counter
procedures, as detailed in the following sections.

SCOPE

OBCS is a facility for checking bar-coded order books against a system stop
list at a selected automated outlet.

The following processes and procedures are described:
a) Receipt of bar-coded order books in the post office
a) Re-direction of bar-coded order books
a) Collection of bar-coded order book by customer
a) Benefit encashment using foil from:
« bar-coded order book
* non bar-coded order book

Where an action involves the use of a piece of counter equipment the
procedures assume the equipment is working correctly. The procedures for
handling OBCS activities in the event of equipment failures are detailed in the
“Fallback” section.

The following processes will be undertaken entirely in accordance with
manual procedures and are therefore not detailed in this document:

a) Impound order book
a) Forwarding/disposal of order books
a) Forwarding of encashed foils

Manual instructions relating to the validity of the order book, foil or person
presenting the order book

GENERAL INFORMATION

EXCEPTION MESSAGES

In the event that a business rule is contravened, the system will display a
message to this effect. For example, it is not normally possible to encash
more than 13 foils from the same order book in one go (3 calendar months).
For this reason, if a figure greater than 13 is input relating to the number of
foils for encashment, the system will advise that the number of foils can only
be between 1 and 13 in one transaction.

3.2 CONTACTING HELP DESK

In the event of any system failure, or advice and guidance being required, the
Horizon System Help Desk must be contacted. Further details are provided
in the Helpdesk Processes and Procedures at Post Office Counters
Document [Ref. S/PRO/0011]. The Horizon System Help Desk can be
contacted on/ ““GRO -

3.3. LOCATING INFORMATION FROM ORDER BOOK

Certain procedures require the keying of the Customer Reference Number,
Indicator, Serial Number and Common Payment Package (CPP)Number

3.4 STATUS OF BAR-CODE ON ORDER BOOK

The system will respond in various ways, as detailed in the procedures,
following the scan of the bar-code. The outcome will depend on the bar-code
status as follows:

Acceptable If the bar-code is acceptable, the system is able to read the bar-
code and it passes the validation rules. The system will display
the appropriate screen in accordance with the information read
from the bar-code.

Invalid If the bar-code is invalid, the system is able to read the bar-code
but it fails the validation rules. The system will provide a prompt
that the order book must be impounded.

Counterfeit If the bar-code is counterfeit, the system is able to read the bar-
code and it passes the validation rules. The system will display

Processes and Procedures (PPD)

the appropriate screen in accordance with the information read
from the bar-code. It will only be detected at a later stage in the
process that a transaction which was not authentic had taken
place.

Unreadable If the bar-code is unreadable, the system is unable to recognise
the bar-code and the screen will not alter. This may occur, for
example, due to a printing error or the customer may have
damaged the bar-code.

On scanning acceptable, invalid and counterfeit bar-codes, a beep will be
made to indicate that the system has been able to read the bar-code. No
such audible indication will be made when the bar-code is unreadable.

3.5 ACTIONS REQUIRED FOR PAY, PAY AND IMPOUND, AND
IMPOUND INSTRUCTIONS

During the use of the operational OBCS system, instructions to the user to do
one of three actions will be given as a result of checking the order book bar-
code or manual input of the order book details against the system stop list.

The instructions given will always be subject to the manual checks that
should be carried out to validate the order book and/or the customer. These
instructions are:

1. Encash
This allows the user to pay valid foils as requested by the customer.
1. Recall

The recall message instructs the user to pay valid foils either up to and
including a specific date or one valid foil and impound the order book.

1. Impound

The impound message instructs the user to impound the order book
without making payments against valid foils.

8.1

FALLBACK

This section deals with the procedures which must be undertaken in the event
of equipment failure within the post office. The following types of equipment
failure will affect the processing of OBCS transactions:

Bar-code reader failure

Keyboard failure

Touch screen operation failure
PC failure - Single-counter office
PC failure - Multi-counter office

1. Network - ISDN connection failure

In the event of an exception condition arising during these procedures, for
example, keyed information is not accepted, the previous procedures should
be referred to in order to identify the action required.

BAR-CODE READER FAILURE

Bar-code reader failure will affect the following OBCS transactions:
1. Receipt of bar-coded order books
1. Re-direction of bar-coded order books
1. Collection of bar-coded order book by customer
1. Benefit encashment using foil from bar-coded order book

In most instances, the receipt and re-direction of order books may be left until
the failure has been rectified. In addition, in the event of bar-code reader
failure, OBCS transactions may be undertaken at another counter position, if
available, or may be undertaken in the following manner:

1. SCENARIO A: If transaction relates to receipt, re-direction or
collection of order book:

e Touch ‘MANUAL INPUT’ button - Enter
(System will display ‘OBCS Manual Entry’ screen)

SCENARIO B: If transaction relates to benefit encashment using foil
from bar-coded order book:

¢ Touch ‘OBC MANUAL’ button - F5
(System will display ‘OBCS Manual Entry’ screen)

1. Touch ‘SYSTEM FAILURE’ field - Upward Arrow *

Processes and Procedures (PPD)

1. Touch ‘YES’ button - F2

(System will display ‘Yes’ in ‘System Failure’ field to indicate that manual
entry is being made because system has failed)

1. Key Customer Reference Number

(This will comprise the National Insurance Number (NINO), Child Benefit
Number or Family Credit Temporary Number)

1. Touch ‘TICK’ button - Enter

1. Key Additional Order Book Indicator (If printed on front of order book)

1. Touch ‘TICK’ button - Enter

1. Key Order Book Serial Number

1. Touch ‘TICK’ button - Enter

1. Key CPP Number from Order Book

1. Touch ‘TICK’ button - Enter

Continue in accordance with previous procedure

* In normal circumstances, the manual keying of order book information
due to the system being unable to read the bar-code would result in the
order book being impounded. In instances where the bar-code reader
has itself failed this course of action, in general, will not be desirable. A
prompt is therefore provided on the manual entry screen which allows the
user to indicate whether the manual entry is due to system failure. The
default value in this field is set to ‘No’ but, in the event of bar-code reader
failure, this value should be set to ‘Yes’. If the ‘Yes’ option is selected,
the normal checks are made against the control notice file and, unless
otherwise indicated by the check, the book will not be impounded.

8.2 KEYBOARD FAILURE

Keyboard failure, whilst potentially affecting all OBCS functions, should not
prevent such activities being handled at the post office counter. Keyboard
failure does not include failure of the bar-code reader which is detailed in

another section.

In the event of keyboard failure, OBCS functions may be undertaken at
another counter position, if available, or using the touch screen as all system
operations are replicated on the touch screen.

TOUCH SCREEN OPERATION FAILURE

Touch screen operation failure, whilst potentially affecting all OBCS
functions, should not prevent such activities being handled at the post office
counter. Touch screen operation failure does not include monitor failure
which, in relation to fallback procedures, would be considered as PC failure.

In the event of touch screen operation failure, OBCS functions may be
undertaken at another counter position, if available, or using the keyboard as
all system operations are replicated on the keyboard.

PC FAILURE - SINGLE-COUNTER OFFICE

PC failure in a single-counter office will affect the following OBCS
transactions:

Receipt of bar-coded order books

Re-direction of bar-coded order books

Collection of bar-coded order book by customer

Benefit encashment using foil from bar-coded order book
Benefit encashment using foil from non bar-coded order book

The receipt and re-direction of order books may be left until the failure has
been rectified. The other transactions may be undertaken in accordance with
manual procedures.

Foreign Encashments should be validated using the Benefits Agency
validation lines, especially for those encashments with amounts exceeding
£100. Nominated Office Encashments should use the current manual stop list
procedure. In both of these situations the transactions should be completed
using the Recovery Procedure detailed in Section 9.

PC FAILURE - MULTI-COUNTER OFFICE

In the event of a PC failure in a multi-counter office, where operationally
feasible OBCS transactions will be undertaken at another counter position.
However, if in the event of PC failure at all counter positions, OBCS
transactions will be undertaken in accordance with the fallback procedure for
PC failure in a single-counter office.

In the event that it is not operationally feasible to use another counter position
or alternatively all counter positions are off line, specific processes must be
followed. Foreign encashments should be validated using the existing
Benefits Agency validation lines, especially for those with amounts exceeding

£100. Nominated Office encashments should follow the manual stop list
procedure.

In addition, in the event of a Gateway PC failure in a multi-counter office,
OBCS transactions will be affected where the customer has not previously
undertaken an OBCS transaction at that post office, for example, foreign
benefit encashment. For such transactions, the system will display a
message that the host system is unavailable and instructing the user to follow
manual procedures to establish whether the issue/payment may be made.
On confirming the message, the transaction may be conducted, on the
system, in the normal manner.

In the case of a Gateway PC failure, foreign encashments, which are those
that are not know locally to the system, should be validated using the Benefits
Agency validation lines, especially for those with amounts exceeding £100. In
these situations the transactions should be completed using the Recovery
Procedure detailed in Section 9.

NETWORK - ISDN CONNECTION FAILURE

In the event of a Network - ISDN connection failure, OBCS transactions will
only be affected where the customer has not previously undertaken an OBCS
transaction at that post office, for example, foreign benefit encashment.

For such transactions, the system will display a message that the host system
is unavailable and instructing the user to follow manual procedures to
establish whether the issue/payment may be made. On confirming the
message, the transaction may be conducted, on the system, in the normal
manner.

In the case of foreign encashments, which are those that are not know locally
to the system, they should be validated using the Benefits Agency validation
lines, especially for those with amounts exceeding £100. In these situations
the transactions should be completed using the Recovery Procedure detailed
in Section 9.
