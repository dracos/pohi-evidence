Subject: Postmaster Police Investigations
Hi Nigel,

I hope all is well.

There are some additional documents on Diligent from a board meeting on October 23 regarding
police investigations and postmasters which I feel need clarifying.

At the time, both Elliot and I were clear that the post office should not be involved in prosecuting.
BT rightly asked for the team to come back to the board with case studies to prove how the new
policy could be implemented, but this never happened. I am unclear as to why this point has been
approved in the minutes when in reality the action needed to approve it has never come to the
board. Can we reopen this item and correct it at the next board meeting?

This is another example why there is misinformation within our business, as there are times when
the board is not approving items but people within the business believe they did.

Another problem is that the minutes for board meetings are coming so late after the meetings,
which is not helpful, can these be sent the following week after board meetings?

Regards
