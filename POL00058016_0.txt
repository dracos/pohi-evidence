Subject: Horizon Integrity Report

Dear All

I have saved a copy on my personal file of a Fujitsu report which covers all aspects to do with the
integrity of the Horizon system. I think we forgot that we had this and they are very expensive to
have done. Luckily it is a generic report that is not specific to one particular case and will be able to




                                                                                                   POL-0054495
                                                                                                                                                         POL00058016
                                                                                                                                                     POL00058016




assist you when drafting advices where the integrity of the Horizon system can be called into
question..

I will scan and save a copy on the POL file for you to access when needed. We have the case of
in Newcastle at the moment where counsel has encountered problems with defence sots in the past
where they had questioned the Horizon system and unfortunately due to not having any evidence to
rebut such criticisms, had to drop the case against them. This report should hopefully prevent this
from happening.

Rachael
