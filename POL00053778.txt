1 have made enquiries of our Chairman's Office team which deals with high profile correspondence
and they know nothing of Mrs Nixon or Dixon of Highcliffe.

The contract managers for the relevant branch can recall nothing according to Nigel the current
manager.

The only material which can be located and which is attached was generated by the person who was
presumably her husband.

Jon Longman, Investigation Manager, spoke to me about the statement made by Mrs Nixon on7 Jan
as this was being used by someone who was being prosecuted in connection with an issue at West
Byfleet branch.

Thad no recollection of any Horizon problems at Highcliffe and the only info I could find is what Craig
has already sent from the EFC.

Anyway I don't see that her statement proves there is anything wrong with Horizon as she has
admitted that the wrong keys were pressed!

Sorry I can't be of any further help.

Thanks - yes, now I've checked back, the statement clearly states Nixon but I went by the e-mail title
(which I have now corrected) which stated Dixon!

Michele
Does this change anything from your perspective - do you search cases by name?

Hi Lin,

There appears to be an error with the spelling/pronounciation of the surname being referred to, and is
in fact NIXON not DIXON.

Having done an online search at Iron Mountain, (for both Nixon and Dixon), I can confirm that we have
no records being held at Iron Mountain for either Mr Maurice or Mrs Eleanor Nixon/Dixon.

There isn't agreat deal within the branch file here in Leeds for Mr Nixon, (which should have gone
away to IM for archiving when he left), other than a few recruitment papers when he first started. I can
find nothing in the name of Mrs Eleanor Nixon's name.

There are though, these papers regarding debtiloss and don't know if they help you or not?

You are probably aware that there is a challenge to the Horizon system again from the prosecution
side of the business. The defence in a case which our criminal team is prosecuting are facing a
challenge that Horizon is not fit for purpose. They have come up with a list of the usual suspects in
terms of ex postmasters who all have the opinion that Horizon is not fit for purpose etc. One has
supplied a statement and she is a person I have not heard of before. I have checked with the
Chairman's Office and they have not heard of her. Please can you ask the relevant contract managers
to supply me with copies of any documents, correspondence which they have in which she disputes
the validity of the system. According to the statement attached she ran at least two different branches
Highcliffe in Dorset.

Michele, Tahira

With the help of both Andy & Ivan we have gone through all the non recorded correspondence in both
rooms & we didn't find any correspondence relating to either Eleanor Dixon former postmistress or
Highcliffe Post Office in Dorset. I have also checked the EFC & the logs for this year & last year and
again found no entries.

Dear Michele

As you know the business is prosecuting a former postmistress who is adducing all sorts of

statements and comments from former postmasters in support of the contention that Horizon is the

cause of all evil and that they were perfect postmasters.

l attach a statement from Dixon along those lines. Please can you locate any material which POL may

still have on this lady so we can assist the barrister who is prosecuting this case on our behalf.

On an allied matter I have heen advised of an accountant who claims to have been engaged by a shop
keepers alliance to act for beleaguered postmasters. As such this issue is going to raise its profile on
the civil side of the law again. Can you recommend who should be advised of this matter within POL. I
was minded to advise Lynn Hobbs, Mike Granville, Lin Norbury. Alwen Lyons- can you suggest who

else should be advised.
