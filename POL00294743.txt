So just for the record again the purpose of recording the interview
is to make sure that we've got a factual record of the meeting and
we've agreed that the content of this meeting will remain
confidential and the information discussed is not to be shared
with other parties unless the expressed permission of all the
intendees around this room is given.

Well I have a problem with that I’m afraid.

Why's that?

Well I want to see what the outcome of the meeting is and then
I'll certainly decide upon what I’m going to do after that, your
grievance is with my wife, I’m only here supporting my wife
actually and listening on to what you’ve got to say. I’ve got
grievances with the Post Office and I’ll discuss those as we go
along.

Well what we won't agree to is to have the meeting recorded if it’s
going to be shared with, I mean that’s the way we would conduct,
this is a personal matter.

Well you shouldn’t have anything to hide anyway I mean we’re
going to discuss.

Well it’s a personal matter between the contract that we’ve got
between your wife.

We haven't got a contract just put you right we haven't, you
breached that contract and as far as I’m concerned we haven't
got a contract. We’re working to a gentleman’s agreement.

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL Item 3

No you've got a contract.

You have a contract Rachpal was.

You breached that contract a year, 6, 7 months ago.

Rachpal was reinstated in terms of the existing contract.

There was no dialogue at all.

What do you mean there was no dialogue?

You breached the contract as far as we’re concerned, if you want
to reinstate her which you have done and the terms of the
contract have to be re-negotiated legally.

No the contract is the contract.

Well take some legal advice on this I’m not going to argue with
you.

The Sub-Postmasters contract is the contract that we have.

Well you breached it, you breached it.

I disagree, we have that contract.

You've breached the contract hence the reason why you
dismissed her and then reinstated her.

No it’s not we've re-instated your wife but it doesn’t mean to say
that we’ve breached the contract. When we reinstate people we
haven't breached the contract, I reinstated your wife and there
was no evidence at all that we had breached the contract none at
all and the losses that we found were losses that were right to
your Office.

I don’t think so.

That’s the bit we haven't had any information of hence hopefully
the purpose, I felt the purpose of this meeting would be get to the
bottom of whether or not there was a loss directly attributable to
the postmaster or whether it was attributable to something else
that’s where I left it with Lyn.

Yeah and we've got the Horizon records and.

And I thought today we’d go through that and we'd be able to see
what you've seen ‘cos no-one’s actually sort of come back to
Rachpal and said.

And that’s the purpose of this meeting.

Actually the loss was down to you, we've got further information
and we've discovered that there’s a loss and it was down to the
actions (indistinct).

Well we've never had a different view that the loss was anything
other than down to the postmaster and the Horizon, we've got the
Horizon records and we've got the cash account etc that we’ve
looked at.

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL Item 3

So have you moved forward from where we left with Andy
Bayfield when he did the appeal and he accepted, he accepted
during the interview that the initiation of the stock unit that had
been closed down some months prior that came, in to use
Rachpal’s words, came back into life with money in it, he said that
that could only be caused by one or two ways and that was either
by a human physically doing that within that branch or it has been
generated by the computer itself for one reason or another and
he was going to go away and get to the bottom of that and as far
as I’m concerned on a technical issue that’s where I still am
waiting to find out how this happened.

Helen has looked at the information from the logs and has put,
has taken that information and put it into a working file for herself
so she can, ‘cos as you appreciate that’s an awful lot of data that
would be for that branch and put it on there and can track where
that amount of money has moved through the system in your
branch so she can talk you through that and we can do that we
can do that now.

Right that might be a good place to start if that’s alright with you
Val before we start agreeing or disagreeing as to whether
contracts have been breached and all that sort of thing ‘cos to my
way of thinking logically we need to start at a point of how did this
happen, was it something someone did in the branch or was it
something the system has done or is it something that a person
has done through not understanding the ramifications of their
actions when they did something to the system and that was the
point I left it with Andy that he was going to go away and get,
somehow get some information that could make sense or what
Rachpal found on that day when she discovered the stock unit
had returned that as far as she’s concerned and has got the
evidence that she shut down and had zeroed it, a couple of roll
overs had taken place since she did that then it came back 0 life
again and that’s, we want to know how that happened so if you’ve
got that mapped out and are able to talk us through it, I think
that’s a brilliant place to start at.

Ok well let’s just see whether we have got that then Helen do you
want to just?

Are we still taping?

We are still taping so we need to go back to the issue around.

No we are going to tape I am interested to see what's going on.
Ok at a point at which we feel that information that you want to
discuss is not appropriate to be shared outside this room, we will
need to turn off that tape and seize that meeting.

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL Item 3

Well if I share it then it’s up to you take legal action against me
I’m happy for you to do that.

Ok but in the spirit of what this meetings intended for, that is not
how we wanted to proceed.

Fine.

With this meeting.

So you're saying we’re going straight into areas of commercial
confidentiality?

Well I don’t know.

Well it’s personal data, it’s around the contract and.

It's personal data in relation to our Post Office, it’s up to us who
we share it with.

No because it’s also around Post Office procedures, it’s around
Post Office contract.

You haven't got any procedures, you don’t follow procedures
hence the reason we’re having this meeting.

I think we have quite a lot of procedures.

Oh yeah right well you don’t follow them.

Well we do and we’re trying to be positive here we're trying to
rebuild the relationship and that’s what I’ve you know called this
meeting for so we can do this, we’re either going to go round in
circles and I do as I said at the start, this really is about us trying
to put the relationship on a firm footing and I don’t think we’re
going to go, get there if we’re not going to have some degree of
trust and I think that’s what I was trying to establish. Mark I don’t
know what your view is as you attend a number of.

I can understand Val’s position yeah he feels he’s the, well on
behalf of his wife he feels he’s the injured party and just wants to
know whether or not it was anything to do with them or whether
there was some other explanation as to why all this happened
and if it turns out that there is another explanation and it’s nothing
to do with Rachpal then we can start talking whether or not there
needs to be any redress sought under the terms of the contract
because if it’s not her fault or anything that her team has done,
she’s totally innocent in all this, then she’s been through a lot of
trauma for nothing, the business needs to address that.

And that’s not the case that wasn’t the case for reinstatement.
Regard, Mark with due respect right ok, as far as I am aware at
the end of the day a dormant stock, I’m an accountant I’ve done
audits myself their auditors are just auditors, called auditors
they’re nothing more than glorified stock takers, in fact in Mick
Searle’s case he couldn't even count the stock and the money
correctly, 3 attempts he had and anyway.

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL Item 3

They had the relevant knowledge and experience to do the job.
No they didn’t if they had they would have counted the stock
correctly, they got it wrong 3 times even the actual auditors came
in and couldn't believe it. Ok so we won't go there right. Now at
the end of the day there was a figure appeared on a dormant
stock unit after 2 months ok, it hadn’t been in operation for 2
months, where this money came from we don’t know my wife had
been bantering on to Mick Searle, Andy and all the other people
the Call Centres etc etc right, none of them had any answers.
Now it’s pointless them showing us oh this is where this money is
we track it, blab bla bla, part and parcel of your appeals
procedures like you say you had procedures should have been,
you should have showed us that then right and you talk about
procedures you haven't got any procedures.

I'd like to park procedures ‘cos I think that is a conversation you'd
have a bit later, I think it is important to find out how it started and
if you're able inch by inch to take us through that and if you want
to get to a point where you’re not prepared to comment on tape
then you can alert us at that point but I don’t think it’s going to
break any official Secrets Act if you explain how Rachpal on the
day she noticed this stock unit come back into life, how did that
bit happen?

Ok and when was that Rachpal?

Well the lady who’s in question whose stock it was she left?
A4thDecember.

4" December.

Right ok.

2009.

2009.

2009.

16" February £436.81 appeared.

So it’s February that we’re saying it appeared then?

16" February.

The procedures in closing the stock unit down was performed in
December and receipts were produced from Horizon that showed
everything had been zeroed and then as Val’s just said?

30" December everything was zeroed off nil

In February this stock unit re-appeared again but this time with
the money on a deposit line so can you confirm that, through your
records are you able to confirm that Rachpal did everything
correctly in December in shutting the stock unit down?

Yes.

Yes there’s no argument there?

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL Item 3

No no no argument on that one.

So then why did it re-appear again in February?

A figure was moved back out of suspense into DH stock unit on
the 17" February at 19.17 by user RATO02.

Yeah which is myself yeah.

Shall we just fire that up Helen, we'll just put it on the screen so
it's easier to talk through and what Helen has done is as I said
she’s looked at the discs and that’s how we get the information
on disc and then inputted into her system so she can make some
sense of it from a visual perspective and then that’s what we'll
show you but we will make the discs available to you. Just see if
you’ve got a clear and whether we need to dim the lights or not,
we'll see what it looks like in a minute. Can you see that or is
that ok Rachpal can you see that?

I think that sort of centre light is that able to be turned off.

Can we turn that one off it might just put us all in darkness for a
minute but as long as we're ok with this it’s fine.

So this first line then?

These are extracts from the transaction logs from Fujitsu ok, so
your first column is obviously a date, second your time, user,
stock unit, column e is either your transaction number or what
event it was, column f is just an explanation of what’s been done,
column g is a product number, everything that goes through
Horizon has a produce number I have a list for that which I’ve got
here, column H is where it’s moved from and to and column I is
the value so sorry I’m just flicking about ‘cos I can’t get it to fit all
on one screen but as we can see that figure appeared on the 17"
February there 19.17 RAT002 from stock unit DH.

So who is RAT002?

That’s myself.

Cleared and lost from suspense for that amount of money and
that 436 in suspense as you can see the figures above was a
combination of 2 a loss and a gain.

Well that’s weird how come that doesn’t appear on the
transaction log that I actually pulled off the system going from the
4" December through to the 14° May? How comes that appears
on the transaction log I pulled off?

I don’t know ‘cos I wasn’t there I don’t know what you asked for
off your system.

No I just went onto my system and I pulled off to see who had
been on the system, none of that entry is shown on.

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL Item 3

Did you pull off the housekeeping log though, this would have
shown under housekeeping because it was put into suspense
account.

So when we cleared the account in December why didn’t this
suspense house keeping account come up then?

Because a house keeping is separate to your stock unit, that
house keeping, the suspense account is for the whole office.
But surely these final trading whatever they are called that you,
when you roll over surely they should show it then shouldn't they?
I can’t answer what you did at your office, I can only say what.
We followed procedures that you’ve put down and these are I’ve
followed procedures.

I can only say what I can see on the transaction logs.

Yeah but then surely like you said you can only see what's there,
I mean surely you can see what we're doing then can’t you?
Yes.

Horizon can see what we’re doing?

I can see what has gone through on the transaction logs, AA
stock unit had a loss of £475.81 and that was put into suspense
account by DAT001 on the 17" February at 18.43. You also had
a gain on SAS stock whichever that was.

Which is safe.

Yeah and that was put into the suspense account at 17.32 by
DAT002.

Hang on can I just stop you there can I just clarify a point, are you
saying they was figures taken out of DH account and put in
suspense account?

I say a loss was taken out of AA account and put into suspense
and then it was cleared back into DH.

Who by?

RATO002.

Cleared back into?

It was taken out of suspense and put into the stock units?

Yeah but why was it in suspense in the first place?

Because it was put in by DAT001?

No I didn’t put it in there.

Who's DAT001?

Yeah that’s my daughter.

Well she obviously has put it in or somebody using her user code
has?

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL Item 3

Yeah but I overlook everything so she would have mentioned to
me that there was a loss of 400 and whatever pounds and you
know.

£475.

But we don’t have access to a suspense account any more do
we?

Sorry?

As postmasters we don’t have access to the suspense account
any more like we used to in the old days.

I don’t work on a counter I can only tell you what this data says.
What this does mark is track so where a users gone onto the
system and logged in and with a password so it’s only particular
to that individual's password, this then tells us what that person
has done on the system.

Yeah I’ve seen these types of things before. The only bit that is
puzzling me is access and suspense account because I’m not
aware that you can do that any more, I don’t know how a
Postmaster would physically do that ‘cos you’ve taken it away
from us because it was being abused so now all losses must be
settled, either settle centrally or made good on the spot you’ve
only got two choices.

What have you got there you got the cash account, the print out
of that there with all the figures on?

And don’t you have to have permission to put things into the
suspense account?

You are meant to have permission.

Yeah I believe auditors can do it. I’ve no idea how an ordinary
clerk would know how to get into that suspense account without
you knowing about it and someone would have had to teach that
person how to do it.

Yeah I would have had to have permission from somebody to say
yes until you know what it’s all about.

But not withstanding that, that was the figure that was derived
from the stock unit that came into life so this is Rachpal, I’ve still
yet to have it explained as to how she got suspense involved, but
am I following this correctly that eventually that 436 ended up in
her AA stock unit?

No in DH stock unit.

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL Item 3

So it’s ended up in her stock unit so this is, I don’t know quite
how this has flowed but she was moving money into her own
stock unit from a loss that was generated by her stock unit giving
her that figure in the first place, we haven’t got the Horizon record
for that stock unit when it reported money on that line, I can see
that that is in some way explaining the transfer of that money out
of that stock unit into the main account but where did the money
come from in the first place?

That 475 has been put from AA stock.

Sorry the dormant stock unit in here is DH yeah?

That’s correct yeah.

So the loss has been generated in stock unit AA and then moved
from stock unit AA into the dormant stock unit.

Well can we trace it back and see where it was and who’s put it in
there who gave the authority to put it there because we’ve just
discussed.

What moving it from.

No hang on, to put money into the suspense account you need
authority that’s what’s just been said here, who gave the authority
to put that money in there because my wife doesn’t have
remember having that kind of a loss put into suspense. Now can
I just touch on something else now ok while we’re on it.

If it’s in suspense account, aren't I supposed to get like an error
notice to say or ask me why is it in suspense account that you
need to clear these losses?

Mark when did this change then from?

We haven't had access to suspense account for a number of
years, money can be authorised to be put in there but it’s my
understanding that can only be done by an auditor with instruction
from someone higher up.

So what you’re saying is technically you’re not able to physically
do that in the branch?

As far as I’m aware yeah, as far as I’m aware there is no buttons
that you can press that enable you to.

We need to check that out because clearly that’s what that’s
telling us.

I think there is some functions that auditors can access by
courtesy of their log on details that they can authorise money to
be transferred into a suspense account and I believe that
suspense account's held in Chesterfield.

We've got the log on details of who transferred this.

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL Item 3

We had an audit in 4° February so who’s decided, like you just
said that auditors have the authority to do that, we had an audit in
February, 4"° February which was fine so who’s to say that they
haven't.

This is not the central settle.

No what this is telling us, Helen just went through, this is
demonstrating on here that on the 17" February.

So why didn’t the auditors pick that up on the 4" February when
we did an audit a proper audit?

Because it wasn’t done until the 17" February so the audit was in
advance of his happening.

Ok let me just, let me just give you another example here of a
similar situation like this, when my wife was reinstated and the
auditors came back and we had a meeting on the night after they
had re-set everything, or was it the following day, Monday they
carried out the audit on Monday night, that’s right we opened the
office on Saturday because you phoned us on Friday evening
didn’t you 6 o’clock, we opened the office on Saturday morning,
Lyn wanted it closed because she forgot to send the auditors in,
the auditors arrived on Monday, they didn’t do the audit until
Monday night, then we had shut the safe and so they couldn’t
finish it so they had to come back Tuesday morning, Tuesday
evening I had a chat with the auditors on the night to see what
the position was, now I’ve got an e-mail here that I’ve e-mailed
yourself and everybody else and Mark, the auditors turned round
and said that they was £600 adrift basically. Before the auditors
came in or finished I had a meeting with my wife and my daughter
to find out what sort of situation the office was in, because I was
there all the time, I was sat in the corner with my own laptop and
sorting out my own things and they told me that the three days,
Saturday and Monday and sort of like prior to like closing the two
days Thursday and Friday that they was probably in the region of
about £200 short, so when the auditor finished his audit and
reinstated the wife and signed it all over, he came with a figure of
£600, I asked him to clarify where that £600 because to me I was
looking at the auditor telling me it’s about £200 because that’s
what the wife and my daughter had told me when I had a meeting
prior to the auditors finishing. When he

Came with of £600 (indistinct) I explained to him I says ok, oh
sorry I asked him to explain to me how he got £600 and he never
had a clue, he then turned round and went onto the computer and
he says “oh look there’s £400 been transferred from the central
safe from that stock unit there” and there’s me, my daughter and
the two auditors and Chris and whoever right. Anyway he started
showing us on the computer just like this oh look there it is bla bla
bla and I’ve said “ok I'll tell you what, when they transferred out of
the safe they have a slip which has to be signed by the person
who’s transferring the money out, the person who’s accepting it at
the till will get a printout to say he’s accepted it ok and he has to
sign or she will have to sign” so you would have 2 slips, I said
“where are these slips?” he said “I don’t know where they are” I
said “oh fine so you don’t know where they are but these are
computer generated figures physically, where is that cash” right
because physically it doesn’t appear as though the money has
gone anywhere ok. He didn’t have the slips right. Then we
realised the person who accepted the stock the £400 supposedly
transferred from the safe, she wasn’t even working that day and
yet the computer had automatically transferred £400 extra out
from what I was expecting the audit to be. I asked him to explain
that because then I came out with it I said “hang on” my daughter
turned round and said “oh hang on Chris, that person who you
are saying has accepted this £400 cash didn’t even work
yesterday but it was showing on the computer as it was done
yesterday like on a Monday and that person hadn't even been at
work all day long and nobody was working on her stock unit and
suddenly this figure and I’ve got it in an e-mail to yourself and
everybody else.

Well we would need (indistinct)

So these things you know to me at the end of the day when you
can’t pinpoint where those figures are coming from or you know
any authority of you know.

Well we can pinpoint where the figures have come from that’s not
true, we can pinpoint where every figure comes from.

Can you manipulate those figures behind the scenes.

No we can't.

No you can’t you can’t get into the system are you saying?

No we can't.

You cannot get into the systems?

No.

You cannot get into the Horizon system?

No.

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL Item 3

Yes you can?

No we can't, no we can't.

Nobody in POL can get into the system, anything that you've
seen on the screen has been logged against a user, logging in on
the system against a password that only that individual should
have in office, we don’t want to know what passwords are so we
cannot access those systems at all.

Ok you probably can’t but your Business Development or
whoever they are in Chesterfield can.

No nobody in POL can do that.

Are you sure about that do you want to go back and ask
somebody.

I've already asked.

You have well I've got some contacts as well within the Fujitsu
and I’ve asked them ok and these will come out in the open later
on.

And what did they tell you did they tell you that people in POL
could access?

Yes.

POL cannot categorically access information in branch because
it’s all done against a user ID.

Fine I’m not going to argue with you over it, I’m not going to argue
over it.

But it's a fact nobody in POL can access Horizon, they can’t
manipulate any of the data.

Fine.

All the system activity it’s down the individual key stroke, it’s
recorded into a separate (indistinct) transaction file, every records
encrypted and written to the log and each record has a unique
sequence number.

So what does KHK stand for then?

Housekeeping.

Housekeeping so don’t we need permission to put that into
housekeeping as well.

So tell me why is it then, why is it you can pull off certain reports
and we can’t then?

We can pull off the reports we can’t change them.

But why can’t se pull those reports off.

I think you do.

You can have a number of the report.

What is house keeping?

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL Item 3

House keeping is for example like what I said to you I received
some stamps short or over ones and I have to phone the stock
centre and they said to me.

But there are certain things that we can’t pull off.

Sorry if we do want this recorded then they're not going to be able
to make sense of all the talking.

So is that what would be designated as local suspense then?
So basically where it’s got HK it’s all the time I’ve been told by
someone I’ll put this into housekeeping.

Right but you’d need authorisation to do that?

Well wherever the shortage has come from for example with the
stamps, I had some stamps, I had received the wrong stamps
and I was told until you get a correction notice, put this in house
keeping so I would need permission

So there’s a button on screen.

No no button, you know I would have probably been talked
through it or you know told this is where you need to put it but I
would have needed to have permission to put things into
housekeeping.

But you could still do it?

I don’t know I mean.

I think we’re taking this (indistinct) action.

You did it yourself even though you’re were on the phone yeah?
No I didn’t do it myself.

They're talked through she says.

No that’s what I’m saying did you do it, I didn’t say somebody
physically.

Physically you're able to do that in branch is what we've said.
Well if I've been told where to do it.

Yes you would be able to do it that’s all I’m saying.

What we will take away is whether you can physically move
things into the suspense account and house keeping in branch.
And isn’t it that if something’s been in housekeeping for a long
time.

Well I am aware you can hold discrepancies caused by the wrong
issue of stock and it’s happened in my own branch and you ca
put it into a holding area, I didn’t know it was called
housekeeping.

And that was my earlier point I think that’s what that is.

Ok but you do need to be talked through how to get there so that
explains how that sum of money 475 was placed in some form of
holding position?

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL Item 3

Yes.

Mark just for the record, we couldn't put that into there, that’s
done by the user ID using the password and that’s been done.
And someone’s issued the password to authorise that movement
so.

No no this is your individual password in branch.

Right ok.

Yes what this is telling us that Rachpal’s daughter has actually
moved that from one stock unit to another.

My daughter isn’t even.

No she was logged onto the system.

Yeah but she would have asked to have asked me ‘cos I’m the
more experienced one, she would have had to have ask me.
I’m not disputing that, all I’m saying is the system tells us that that
user has that date and time undertaken that activity on the
system.

But it wasn’t there very long in any event, it’s been moved into
Rachpal’s stock unit.

Yeah DH.

Ok so it’s spent a bit of time in an area that we've yet to discover
how you access that, can you do it through building up your
knowledge and do it inappropriately or has someone on the
helpline talked either Rachpal or her daughter into putting it into
suspense, Rachpal then thinking better of it has moved it out and
clearly placed it in her own stock unit.

In DH stock unit.

Is that yours?

No that was a dormant stock unit.

No that’s Debbie’s, Debbie the lady.

The dormant one?

That’s the dormant one.

So you're saying then on what dates that entry into DH?

17" February wasn't it?

Yes.

So the loss has been cleared by putting that into the dormant
stock.

And that was the first date the stock unit had that entry in it and
according to that it was done by RAC002?

Yeah.

And that’s you Rachpal yes?

Yeah that’s me but you know.

Are you the only person that has access to your logging and
password?

Yeah.

Do you keep them, you are keeping them to individuals within
branch yeah?

Yeah.

There wouldn't be anybody else in the office at that time anyway
apart from my wife and my daughter.

Alright.

Half past 7 on the night, what time did you say it was sorry?
That’s a Wednesday isn’t it?

19.17.

Half past 7 there wouldn’t be any staff there.

And that’s what was done just before producing the final balance
as you can see from the time indicated on the screen.

I’m just trying to find the report I’ve got here of the stock unit
reporting that money for the first time.

There 4.36.81 on the 17" at 19.19.

Yeah 19.19 final report his copy there.

But it doesn’t say who’s actually put it in here and that’s never
been told apart from these guys now coming up with this here.
What the log is showing is at 18.43?

Yeah.

It's been cleared.

Into the suspense account.

Into a suspense account and then transferred out of that
suspense account.

Into DH.

Into DH?

Yes.

So the shortage, wherever it’s come from, it’s just been moved
around the account a bit?

That 436 is a combination of the loss of 475 and a gain of 39.
Yeah.

That’s where the figure’s come from I don’t know where the initial
figures have come from I can only tell you where that.

It was a loss generated against the stock unit. So just one stock
unit or two stock units?

One, no there’s two stock units.

So the loss.

The loss was against AA and the gain was against SAF.

SAF.

Stock unit SAF.

Who's that?

That's safe.

So reading that, a gain and a shortage has been discovered in
the safe stock unit.

Yeah again of £39 has been in that stock unit yeah and a loss of
475.81 in AA.

And the net amount has been moved into the dormant stock unit.
So when Rachpal’s pulls off her trading statement and sees this
stock unit making an appearance for the first time since it was
shut down.

It's because that figure’s been taken back out of.

That logs saying that it was Rachpal that put it in there?

Yes.

Yeah but how can I take it out of housekeeping?

I can only tell you what the data’s telling me here.

Yeah but you're the expert here.

I don’t work on Horizon I work on the data behind it.

That’s weird because why is it I can pull off a transaction log on
our system from the 4" December to the 14" May right and
nothing comes up on it, none of this comes up on it.

Did you ask for a housekeeping log.

It doesn’t matter, it doesn’t matter it would come up saying that
RAT transferred bla bla bla I went into her stock unit and my
daughter's stock unit and said right ok what were the
transactions.

We can only get (indistinct) reports we can get transaction log
which shows.

Or an events log.

Or an events log. The events log I’m assuming will show
housekeeping things?

This, yes.

Where you logged on or you logged off.

It's irrelevant isn’t it the figures

No.

No no it’s irrelevant because, no no hang on, correct me if I’m
wrong, if the figure is in that stock unit, once I do a transaction log
it’s going to show up there just like that, that yes there was a
movement.

Mark just said there’s 2 logs there’s an event log anda
transaction log am I right?

Yes.

So this would, correct me if I’m wrong, the housekeeping which
show the events log.

As far as I’m aware.

I’m not on about the housekeeping I’m on about that once the
money’s been transferred from the housekeeping into the stock
unit you do a transaction log to say how did that money get in
there it would have said yes RAT or DAT transferred it into it.

On the housekeeping log yes.

And on the transaction log.

No on the housekeeping log.

I don’t know at what point it would show on a transaction log, I
can see it, with you when, it’s the event log that would have
recorded this moving.

That movement yeah.

This movement and anyone who logs on or logs off it records ‘cos
they are events but whether or not entering money into a stock
unit it constitutes a transaction as well.

No it’s an event isn’t it on there.

Yeah I can see it’s an event but whether it constitutes transaction
as well I don’t know.

I’m not sure it does Mark but again.

So who can pull off these events logs then do you know?

Yes.

Have you been shown how to pull off these event logs?

No.

Has anybody trained you on them?

No.

Ok you obviously (indistinct).

Yeah I mean I've always known that there’s an event log but
because they don’t normally tell you very much unless you've got
a big office where you are moving a lot of stuff around, that’s the
only time it comes of value, I would say the average office gets
no, hardly any information off of the event log other than who was
logging onto their system and logging off.

I think you’re right it depends on how many users there are so if
you are pulling together a number of stock units in the branch
then the event log is a good way of tracking.

It's a very useful thing to have.

Any anomalies.

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL Item 3

But again I think Val’s half right that the use of that and the
encouragement to pull one off as part of your balancing
procedures as a postmaster has never been promulgated to
postmasters as best practice.

I can’t dispute that either way.

It's something the federation always say to people when we get
phone calls I can’t balance I think something’s gone wrong we
say freeze pull all the transaction logs for every stock unit and an
event log for the whole branch, that’s our standard retort it’s what
we tell people, it would be nice to have that in big letters on the
front of any guidance booklet as well the business issues.

It would be part of the training at the time, that said when you are
training at the time there are some things that stick better than
others and it depends on how well you balance whether you
would kind of ever need to kind of use that.

So we've established that the shortage originated, according to
this log, the shortage originated in the safe stock unit.

AA.

And it’s been.

AA Mark.

Sorry in AA who's is AA?

That's Rachpal’s.

Right so a shortage originated in Rachpal’s and according to that
it was transferred into a redundant stock unit by Rachpal or by
her daughter?

By her daughter that says on there.

No it went into the.

Sorry AA is who's stock unit that’s your daughter's is it?

That’s a shared stock unit.

Right so yourself and your daughter operate that one do you?
Mm.

Right ok ‘cos the user on there for that loss is I presume your
daughter DAT?

Mm.

Ok and then when it was moved from that stock unit into the
dormant it was using which user?

RAT.

Which is Rachpal.

Right and it’s at that point you’re denying that you did that action?
Yeah.

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL Item 3

Ok can I just ask you a question here then, if we’re looking at the
final balance trading statements you are now obviously saying
that generated on an AA stock unit yes?

Yes.

But if this final trading statements don’t show any shortages, how
can that be possible?

Because it was moved into the suspense account.

It's got to have been generated on a stock unit initially?

But on the trading statement there is a (indistinct)

Before it’s transferred into.

Isn’t it saying the suspense, I think on the trading statements I
think.

Well no it’s got to be generated as a shortage initially for it to be
transferred into a suspense account, you're not going to just go, if
the books have balanced Nil Nil, you’re not going to be stupid
enough to take out 400 odd pound and put them into a suspense
account, it’s got to have generated a shortage in your till in order
for you to then transfer it into a suspense account, surely
because if you, obviously you've transferred it in a suspense
account because you can’t put your hands on it or you don’t know
how that £475.

What you're saying is there would have been a trial balance
performed on her stock unit?

Absolutely before she rolled over.

To know that you’re short

Absolutely.

To know I better get rid of this?

Exactly where has this come from, I know my wife she will stop
there and I've been there ‘til midnight working accounts.

That would ascertain that in Rachpal’s stock unit that did actually
throw up that kind of shortage. Have you got, did anyone thought
to pull off the individual’s stock units positions on that day?
That’s for trading period 10 a balance a shortage of 475.81.
That’s the whole office?

No that’s stock unit AA.

AA I see right yes it’s broken down there.

So there’s a loss and then a surplus and a net of 475.81.

Yeah the surplus was discovered in the safe.

In SAF yeah which is as you can see.

But the grand loss, the original, the original full loss, disregard
overages is in stock unit AA.

In trading period 10.

In trading period 10 but you’re saying that you never balanced
short that?

No.

And have you got in your office trial balance and snapshot
balances for individual stock units for that?

Yeah we will have.

‘Cos that will show that there was a shortage. That's only
showing well it’s showing

Ok what date would that have been period 10?

She transferred the shortage over on the 17' February so would
it be 17" February?

12" January to the 17" February discrepancy short transferred

what does that mean?

Sorry Val what are you looking at?

Well I’m looking at the final balance trading statement which is

that there you're talking about the 475 I’ve found that figure on
here ok branch total and it says ‘discrepancy over, sorry short

transferred’ what does that mean?

Can I see what you’re looking at or?

There’s that figure they’re referring to. There’s the suspense
account it hasn’t been transferred into the suspense account.
No it’s been transferred into the dormant stock,

No it was transferred into suspense and then out of suspense
and into the dormant stock.

No it hasn't. I’m looking at the final trading statements here. I
take it that’s the suspense account isn’t it, suspense there’s
nothing in there.

What's that figure then?

Well that’s a minus 123 it’s not 475.81 is it? That’s the figure
they're referring to.

No I’m just trying to find to see if we got a snapshot balance or a
trial balance that would support that figure of 475 in period 10. In
theory you should have a discrepancy shouldn't you to support
that on your trial balance.

Before you transferred it out yes.

There will be a report that is the mirror copy because you need to
know you're short to begin with, the only way of finding out if
you’re short is strike a balance the discrepancy, the variance will
tell you what your shortage or your gain is and then it’s up to do
what you do with that figure after that, you either transfer it out
which is what the previous chart was showing happened to it
although Rachpal’s denying it was her, yet to get to the bottom of
it but we haven't got anything that supports that figure that’s
come from the branch so I don’t know if we would have, should in
theory as part of your case papers should have a trial balance or
even a final balance.

You would have to transfer it before the final balance.

Yes so it would have to be the trial balance.

It would be the trial balance.

I would guess yea.

It would be a trial balance ’ll have it in the office. But the final
trading statements doesn’t show it being transferred into the
suspense account ‘cos they’re saying it was transferred into the
suspense account and then out of the suspense account into DH.
But that would appear on your trading statement though wouldn't
it?

It would appear on the final trading statement.

If you’ve done a transfer of money out of your balance, struck a
final balance to show a zero balance, that’s all that report would
show if you then produced your statement it would show if you
had put the money into suspense or another stock unit that
doesn’t get shown until the trading statements produced is that
correct?

What this is telling us here is that the loss has been generated
and then moved into the dormant stock unit so when you report
your balance trading, it’s a zero discrepancy because actually you
put the loss value of £436 odd into another stock unit and it’s
generating as either the cash or stock figure hence you're
balancing so had that money not been transferred out of the
stock unit, the loss and into another one then it would have
shown a loss.

Right. But then it makes a re-appearance in it’s next form into
the DH stock unit?

Well yeah that’s because Rachpal has moved it from this, what
it’s telling us on the screen is that Rachpal has moved that from
one stock unit to another and put it in as I don’t know cash is it or
stock, cash yeah to said there’s a cash value in that stock unit but
actually the stock unit was empty?

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL Item 3

Yeah and how do you access a dormant stock unit that you
closed down?

Just attach yourself to it.

Even though it’s closed down, don’t you have to like, if you’ve got
rid of it.

It wasn’t deleted was it.

Sorry.

It wasn’t deleted at this time.

None of them could delete it, Rachpal couldn’t and we had Andy,
Mick they all tried to delete and they couldn't delete it.

No it didn’t get deleted while later on in the year.

The reason you can’t delete it is because you can’t attach
yourself to it, once you attach yourself to it as a user, it’s not
classed as inactive, therefore you cannot delete it, you can only
delete an inactive stock unit so when I worked in.

But it became inactive on the 4" December or the end of
December and we tried to delete it off the system in January.
But as soon as you attach yourself to a user then you cannot
delete it so you have to delete it before you attach it.

Sorry if we've cleared it in December.

But it was never cleared, it was never deleted.

It was cleared in December we've got the evidence here it was
cleared in December.

Yeah all the cash was cleared out of it.

But the stock unit was not deleted.

But the stock unit wasn’t deleted.

It wouldn’t delete even Andy and Mick tried it, even your auditors
tried to delete it your help centre couldn't do it.

It was empty but it was not deleted from the system.

And how do you delete it?

You delete it before attaching yourself as a user.

As long as the trading period rolled.

So the stock unit in question was issued to a member of staff who
left in December, everything was taken out of that account.

The cash and stock yeah.

And zeroed.

Yeah.

And we've got the confirmation that it was empty.

Yeah that’s fine yeah.

So then from that point onwards what do you do to delete it,
never mind?

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL Item 3

The office has to have rolled over trading period and nobody will
had to have attached to it at all.

During that time but if someone had?

Once you attach to it whether you do anything with it or not, if you
attach to it and then come back out of it, it’s classed as not
dormant.

Right.

Even though you haven't worked in it you haven’t done anything
in it you haven't put cash in it.

So once you do that attachment.

Once you do that ten you’ve got to wait for the next trading period
and not attach to it and delete it.

Right so some time between December and February,
someone's attached themselves to this stock unit, whether they
did anything with it or not?

They may have attached to it to try and delete it.

And left themselves attached.

but once you’ve attached to it, well even if you attach to it and
come back out of.

So what you should have done is not attach themself to it and let
it clear itself, having zeroed it.

Just don’t attach to it until you delete it.

In the fullness of time it disappears completely.

No it doesn’t disappear you've still got to delete it but you don’t
attach to it to delete it.

Right so somehow someone’s advised the postmaster to attach
themself to it so that you can go and delete it which is wrong.
Which has stopped you being able to delete it yeah.

Without anyone knowing.

There’s clearly been a misunderstanding throughout Mark
because there are records that should say that delete, tried to
delete but failed yeah so people have gone onto it as a user and
tried to do that so that’s what happened.

Yeah I saw one of those entries ‘delete failed’.

But what this demonstrates is that the figure didn’t simply appear
in the dormant stock.

It was placed there?

It was placed there.

455 MB Does it show where in that dormant stock unit that money was
placed, under what line was it placed, when you go into that,
you’ve got access right now to that stock unit ‘cos you didn’t
delete yourself as an attached user so on what line was that 436
placed?

456 AB _ It would be in the cash, it would have just been a cash shortage
‘cos there was no stock or cash within that so it would have just
shown as a minus in the cash.

457 MB_ So how do you physically do that by going into a stock unit as an
attached user, you have to enter figures somewhere you can’t
just throw a figure at it it's got to be entered on a line?

458 HR _ It’s been pulled in from housekeeping hasn't it it’s been
downloaded from housekeeping.

459 AB Ascash?

460 HR_ Ascash.

461 VA __ Noithasn’t that’s not what it’s showing here.

462 MB __ No ‘cos it doesn’t appear, like the stock unit when it started to
report itself again didn’t show that money as cash, it showed it on
a deposit line as far as I remember.

463 HR _ Itwill have shown it as down from housekeeping won't it?

464 MB_ Well! don’t understand this housekeeping business, it’s gone into
local suspense and been removed, according to that record, it’s
been removed from suspense and placed in the stock unit, but
it’s got to be put on a line, it’s got to be reported as something.

465 HR _ Right! don’t know.

466 MB __ But how do you report it as nothing, how do you remove it from
suspense and just throw it at a stock unit, I don’t understand?

467 AB You're right it would have been reported as something it’s
whether Helen was looking at that?

468 HR _ Icanonly see.

469 RA _ There’s no way you can put sort of 81p on a £10 it would throw it
out wouldn't it it would say there’s no such figure note.

470 AB_ Yeah it doesn’t (indistinct) to it so.

471 RA __ You've got to do it in like denominations of 20’s.

472 AB We've not got the information here to say that, what we’ve got
Mark is that it tracks that money into that stock unit.

473. VA __ Have you guys, have any of you actually worked in a branch?

474 AB_ Yes Ihave.

475 VA _ And you've used transactions and everything and balancing etc
etc?

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL Item 3

Well I used to run Crown Offices as Branch Manager yeah so I
started my time on the counter when it was manual, I then went
onto what we had in the Crown Office which was called an Echo
System and then I worked on Horizon as a Branch Manager and
then trained.

Which office was this then sorry?

It was several actually but in Swansea in South Wales and then I
actually trained and assisted Sub-Postmasters when we
introduced Horizon so the transition from working from a manual
balance on this as well so.

Were your contracts ever changed over then because
presumably the contract of services for a Sub-Postmaster was on
the old basis of doing cashing up manually wasn't it, not
computers,

It was never specific in the contract around whether it was a
manual or computerised and I can’t recall at the time but it was a
big deal obviously.

How did you used to deal with your shortages in branch offices
then?

How did we sort them?

Yeah did you ever have any shortages?

Well yes ‘cos human error does occur when I was in branch in
those days, if you balance less than £5 you put the money in
yourself, if you balance more than £5 you declared.

When you was a Manager.

Well if I was serving on the counter yeah or the staff.

Surely you’re employed that’s your employer’s responsibility why
would you have to put it in/

No part of the agreement was that you made good a loss under a
certain level, anything above that level then you declared as a
loss and then.

Was it written off?

No, well yes but if you had so many losses then you were
disciplined and it could lead to your dismissal so you were
required.

So how did the Post Office deal with those losses then?

How did they deal with the losses?

Who made good those losses?

Post Office.

Tax payer basically or Sub-postmasters (indistinct) we're carrying
it basically, figure of round about 2 million pounds well you would
have been.

Val you asked me the question I answered the question for you
I’m not going to be drawn into any other comments on that but I
think I answered your question.

Ok you’re talking about you’ve worked in a branch, when did you
actually leave then?

When did I leave the branch, well I've been in the business for 26
years I worked in the branch actually in branch for 10 and then I
then spent the rest of my career working in relation to branch, I’ve
been in and out of branch various roles.

Do you have any views on unaudited transactions?

Sorry unaudited what do you mean by that?

On-line banking for argument’s sake?

On-line banking as a personal view I think on-line banking I use it
myself.

Let me give you a scenario here ok, back in the day when we
used to come to the office, I come with a paying in book right I
give you my £500 and you accidentally typed in you know 50,000
or whatever right, you stamped my book, you’ve kept a copy of
the paying in slip as well, at the end of the night you pull off some
reports and you can see exactly where you're errors are.

Yes.

No problem that’s an audited transaction isn’t it?

Mm.

Because you can put right the errors on the night.

Yes,

Now you've brought in new procedures whereby I come in and I
come with my card yes?

Yes.

I give you my card and I give you my £100. You swipe the card
on the till yeah it brings up all my details you accidentally put in
£1,000 right, you give me the slip and you give me my card back,
have you retained anything?

Well it depends whether I’ve produced a receipt.

No would you retain a receipt, there’s only one receipt produced.
Well you can actually do a duplicate customer receipt and keep it
yourself.

There’s only one receipt produced isn’t there yes?

Well you can request a duplicate so when I have gone into
branch of late and not been as familiar as I used to be with
transactions, I have produced myself a customer receipt.

Yeah but you would only produce that receipt if you felt that you
needed to do it, you wouldn't do it automatically.

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL Item 3

518 AB __ I would do it just to reassure myself that I was up to speed as I
used to be and that would be my safety net.

519 RA _ But then at the end of it if you had say 10 customers came that
day, are you telling me that you’re going to produce a receipt?

520 VA _ Can I just ask you a question, hang on let me just finish here ‘cos
I just want to bring up a point here right about unaudited
transactions, so let’s just say for argument’s sake let’s just say for
argument’s sake, the whole point of you bringing in the swipe
card and all these on-line banking is to cut out on paper basically
so they would be no necessity for you to take up a duplicate
receipt whatsoever because if that was the case you wouldn't
have got rid of the books ok you would have kept the paying in
slip book ok, no hang on, ok so end of the night, let’s just say for
argument’s sake I gave you £100 you've typed in £1000, your
Horizon system is going to show you are £900 short.

521 AB __ And it would be my mistake.

522 VA __ Your mistake.

523 AB __ I would be liable for that mistake.

524 VA __ No the Post Office would be vicariously responsible.

525 AB _ NotifIwas acting as the sub-postmaster I would be responsible
for that mistake, we train individuals and we trust individuals to.

526 VA __ But would you be able to no hang on would you be able to find
that £900 shortage?

527 A Well if I balanced and I looked and I thought I’m out £900 I would
go through my transaction log to see whether I could identify
anything that would look like that.

528 VA — You wouldn't find it make I’m telling you now you wouldn't find it,
any of your experts wouldn't find it unless I was the only customer
that came in and it stuck in your mind that Oh you know what Val
came in and he only gave me £100.

529 AB __ And that has happened in the past yes course it has.

530 VA Not when you are dealing with 20, 30 bankings withdrawals etc
etc.

531 AB _ Val the issue is that we operate in an automated systems, you
are trained accordingly to operate the system and then we trust
you to do that as per the procedure, if you make a mistake you
are liable under the terms of your contract to make good that
mistake.

532 VA — You should make sure that the jobs are done correctly and the
procedures are correct as well, but you’ve taken away things that
you know for a fact that these guys make a mistake, we can have
them under their contract, that is entrapment.

533 AB _ It’s not entrapment.

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL Item 3

534 VA _ Yes it is because if that wasn’t the case, then you would have
automatically have the system producing two receipts so they can
audit their transactions, what is the point of having an audit on the
transactions when there are transaction there that can’t be
audited?

535 AB _ But (indistinct) we have a person standing there they scan the
information, they look at the screen it says.

536 VA _ We're all human beings we make mistakes you said that before.

537 AB __ I’m not disputing that what I’m saying is if you make a mistake
you're liable for the consequence of that mistake that’s what I’ve
said so if you have taken, you've scanned.

538 VA __ Entrapment I call it.

539 AB _ Thatis not entrapment.

540 VA _ Itis entrapment you know it’s entrapment.

541. AB Well! think I have to disagree with you there but can we come
back to what we’re meant to be discussed.

542 VA _ Well! disagree with all of this anyway ‘cos I totally, it’s rubbish as
far as I’m concerned.

543 AB Well it’s the activities that have been logged against the system
Val.

544 VA  Onwhat basis? You guys haven't even got any explanation as to
where those figures have come from, you're just showing us
some, on that day this, track them back and show us exactly how
these things appeared, show us evidence that those were put into
suspense on who's authority because you need authority to put
them into suspense account.

545 KG_ Nowhich users transferred those amounts of money into?

546 VA You can’t put them into suspense accounts we've just
ascertained that.

547 KG _ Nowe haven't ascertained that.

548 AB We haven't I’ve said I’d check it out, we haven't ascertained that
because.

549 VA Why don’t you know that then I mean you’ve been in the business
26 years you’ve worked in branch?

550 AB When! operated the system you could and technically I believe
you still can but I will want to verify if there’s been a change to
that.

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL Item 3

My understanding we can’t, if we have got the access if we sat
and talked about it, I’m pretty sure somebody would be on the
phone the next day to say you’ve accessed the suspense account
without authorisation ‘cos I don’t really have any problems in my
branch I’ve never had to get involved with Chesterfield to seek
permission or to be advised except once where they did advise
us.

Well just recently we had a penny hanging around in the
suspense account so they phoned us up and asked us why was
that penny hanging around in the suspense account.

How long was this in the suspense account for Helen can the
system tell you?

You know it needs to be removed why is it hanging around?
You've put that figure in at 18.42 and took it back out at 19.17 but
whether anything else is in there I haven't.

And this is how incompetent they are right, if they are telling me
that figure has been in there since February, it’s taken them ‘til
May 6" to come out, do an audit, they can access the system,
they can see the system, they know what stock we’ve got what
monies we've got bla bla bla, why the hell didn’t somebody from
the Post Office say “oh you've got this in housekeeping”.

What this is saying it went in suspense.

I know what it’s saying, what I’m saying to you is why were your
department incompetent in that why had it taken them 3 months
to come up and say?

Because it wasn’t in there for 3 months that’s the issue.

Hang on you're just saying it’s there it’s been transferred there in
February, the audit and my wife was suspended in May.

Hang on can we just walk this again so Helen can you just talk
me through it was put in suspense account when?

18.43

18.43 on the 17" February.

17" my wife was suspended on the 15" May.

It was taken back out of suspense account at 19.17 on the same
day.

On the same day.

And it appears in DH stock unit but it appears on a line called
‘other payments’ sorry beg your pardon ‘other receipts’.

Other receipts so it will have cleared out of suspense into that.
Yeah so we need an understanding of how you can actually do
that realistically, how.

And that’s an action we've taken.

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL Item 3

You know so someone’s got to go again as far as I’m concerned
without permission you've gone and provided it’s technically
possibly to do it, gone back into housekeeping or suspense to
take the money out and then selected this redundant stock unit
which you obviously still got access to ‘cos you’ve somehow
attached yourself to it and then you go and place it on a receipt
line is that, again is that technically possible to access a receipt
line and say well I'll leave it there?

Yeah.

So what is ‘other receipts’.

Yes I mean the answer to that is yes it is, we need the detail to
find out what the processes is to do that.

But it’s still, is it still a shortage at that point ‘cos it’s still part of
the cash account and the next time you strike a main balance that
stock unit will report itself as having this much money in there but
then I believe later on it got transferred out of that stock unit, we
haven't got that, I don’t know when that was done?

Just go on that point, my understanding and this is what I need to
check whether it’s changed is that it is technically possible for a
user to be able to do that without another password or something
so it’s technically, procedurally you should have authority to do it
but does the system stop you doing it, I don’t believe it does and
that’s the bit I need to verify.

Yeah and I don’t know the flow of how you follow to do it I mean
it’s technically it is possible to get into a suspense account ‘cos
they did advise my branch to do that one once for a small amount
and we refused to do it ‘cos we know that once you put money in
suspense, if you don’t get it out in the proper way it can cause
allsorts of problems so we, until our TC arrived we put the money
in ourselves rather than get involved in suspense so I know
technically it’s possible but I thought there was like passwords
you had to put in to access it and things like that, that’s my
naivety ‘cos I’ve never.

It was never the case but I will check that out that’s the bit I need
to verify.

And can you just explain this to me please, that figure appears in
line 12 ok ‘other receipts’. Line 12 states ‘total of receipt
transactions including Client transactions eg personal banking
deposits carried out in the current branch trading period’. How
can that just be a transfer then?

Because the user has transferred it.

Well hang on line 12, these are your procedures here these are
your instructions from your manuals state that any figure
appearing in line 12 will be a total of receipts transactions
including Client transactions i.e. personal banking so they can’t
just be transfers from a suspense account into a receipt can it
really?

Well it should be what you’ve read but you can put from a
suspense account into that line that doesn’t mean to say that
what should have gone on that line is on that line, that’s what
should be in there what the instructions saying. It’s just the same
as you can put you know wrong entries on wrong lines, it doesn’t
make it right but that’s what’s happened. The facts that we have
got is that these amounts.

They're not facts they’re just figures that you’ve believed to be
facts basically.

We haven't made these up these are from the Horizon logs these
are from the records they can’t be.

Why weren’t they produced at the appeals then tell me that?
Because we hadn’t got the.

Why weren't they, they were part and parcel of what Andy
Bayfield said he was going to get before he made his decision.
Well we’ve now got them now and we're talking through these
now so whatever's gone in the past, we have the information now
and that’s what we're here to do is talk through these figures with
you.

I’m not satisfied with that but anyway shall we move onto other
issues then or?

Well we'd like to understand why you're not satisfied and what
they?

Well I'm not completely satisfied with all these figures that you’ve
come up with you haven't actually explained with.

I can read the flow of events and I caught a glimpse of the money
coming out again on a slide you just put up, is this the one where
it's gone into AA and DH so it’s now?

It's transferred back out of.

On the same day?

No a month later on the 17" of the 3°.

Oh sorry I’m looking at yeah, so in March that money comes out
of DH?

Yeah and that goes back into lost local suspense.

Oh it’s back in suspense now?

Yeah that was a month later.

And how long did it sit in suspense.

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL Item 3

I haven't followed that through I wasn’t asked.

Hang on hang on hang on a minute, hang on, weren't these
figures actually transferred and put into pound notes and that’s
where the whole problem was not suspense account?

That’s when the auditors came, that’s when the auditors.
Exactly.

So this, we haven't got any records of money sitting in suspense
for any period of time, when Rachpal saw this money in the stock
unit because no-one according to Rachpal, no-one was able to
understand what she was talking about how this occurred, she
took the money out of DH by our own admission but she placed it
in her own stock unit.

Why would I want to do that?

On the pound note line.

On the pound note because it was prompting us where’s this
money come from because she told me didn’t you?

It didn’t sit in suspense for any length of time.

Well it didn’t sit in suspense on the 17" it went in and came out
No no we're talking about March now we had a slide that showed
in March.

Shortage discrepancy put back into.

Shortage discrepancy suspense

Is put back in on the 17" March.

Along with the same overage?

It's cleared back in.

Those are different 39.29 the other one was a straight 39.

So we've got this overage again, the same amount.

Sorry where you looking?

39.29.

No it was 39 exactly the first time round Mark.

Oh was it right.

No it wasn’t.

I think it was.

It's always been the same figure 309 whatever it is.

No it’s 39.

It's this use of suspense that is unusual about with this.
Basically yeah it’s gone in and out and.

Yeah I can see the ins and the outs in February but can we move
to march where it’s supposed to have come out.

There.

So the 436 is in DH.

That’s the day that it was moved back into suspense.

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL Item 3

You see that’s weird isn’t it because when we’ve closed DH count
down look there’s £39 there that’s been transferred.

So when did it get into, so if that actually happened on the e17th
March if that was true that that transfer actually occurred, when
did it come out of suspense into Rachpal’s AA stock?

They had a gain of £39.29 on that same day in AA yeah.

On the?

On the 17" of the 3° on line 27 can you see, if you look further on
column G.

Under G yea.

Yeah that’s a gain of 39.29 and then 397.52 there was put into
AA stock and that is cleared loss from suspense.

And that’s the net.

So that’s 2 isn’t it?

This doesn’t make sense. Ok so there’s an overage nothing
unusual for a unit that size but you’ve still got your, you've still got
your 436 sitting in DH and then it’s transferred reduced by it’s
overage again, transferred into?

AA.

AA making it 397.

Yeah.

And left in AA?

Yeah.

But the 397.52 is the net figure from 436.81 minus the over of
39.29 so that’s why the amount has changed.

So allegedly a decision’s been taken to transfer 436 out it hit an
overage which reduced a little bit further?

Yes.

And again, it’s got your log on details on.

But then what's that 96.62?

That’s in June.

There’s a further surplus in June isn’t there, is that not the surplus
in?

No that’s another shortage it’s a combination of AA bureaus.

So where’s April then sorry you’ve got March there where’s April,
May?

Probably didn’t use suspense in April, May.

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL Item 3

So what we're left with then is figures flying in and out of a
suspense account, but we’ve yet to establish whether you can
physically do that, we know technically it’s possible but whether or
not there’s any barriers to stop you but if there’s unfetted access
to a suspense account, I’m surprised that Sub-Postmasters
haven't worked that one out and are holding losses so that they
can argue with the business later.

And I think a lot do.

‘cos that’s how it used to be.

And I think a lot still, although there’s instruction saying you
shouldn't use that.

They’re still doing that.

A lot of Sub-Postmasters do.

So why isn’t it that if they’re doing it, why aren't they asked why
they’re doing it?

I mean like you said you had a penny in there and you had
somebody ringing you saying why had you got that.

But how long would it take the business to say say someone’s
accessed the suspense account without permission, I’m sure this
is monitored?

No the Cash Centre can see all the figures that we put in.

But they wouldn't go in, they would not go into.

They know exactly how many pennies we put on the penny
column, how many, what we've done in what, they can see
exactly that you know.

Then they juggle them around, we've got evidence of that so no
need to look at me like that.

I didn’t look at you like anything.

Mark I’m not sure, clearly we will be monitoring suspense
account, I’m not sure of the frequency, again I can check that but
in some of the instances it’s just gone in and out so clearly that
wouldn't register with this ‘cos it’s within.

It caused us no end of (indistinct) within the Federation when the
suspense account sort of unfetted access was taken away from
us, I thought that was a physical removal I didn’t appreciate that if
you know what you were doing, you could actually still access it
but I thought perhaps there might be some sort of gay keeper
there saying the next day almost you shouldn’t have gone there
and that would have forced you to take it out again but it would
appear if what you’re saying’s correct that this practice is still
going on, whether or not it’s being efficiently policed I don’t know.
And it will I guess it depends on the scale of it and the resource
available etc.

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL Item 3

Because what we’re told is if you’ve got something you want to
dispute, no-one mentions suspense account, you're told settle
centrally, now does that put something into your housekeeping,
where does that shortage go?

Effectively it holds it doesn’t it?

Yeah but where does it hold it, is that an explanation as to why
money’s gone in?

I think it’s one in the same but I think that’s the action we need to
explore.

Has someone on the system in February pressed ‘settle centrally’
without realising what they've done is that why the 436 has gone
into the suspense account and Rachpal has thought this is
connected with the stock unit and has gone off on a fools errand.
Can I just ask Helen, wouldn’t that show on there if it was settled
centrally on the loss?

As far as I know (indistinct).

‘cos we haven't got an explanation as to how the money got in
local suspense or housekeeping whatever it’s called.

We have on the event log, clearly it shows a user.

It’s got a user there but it’s been denied that the user actually did
that act.

Nobody else can access that use account, nobody, it’s password,
the only person that's got the password is the user, nobody else
Mark can use that.

How do you do the maintenance on theses systems then if
nobody else can get onto the systems, don’t you do any
maintenance on Horizon?

We up-date software Jujitsu would, yeah we would up-date
software and we would do routine maintenance but that doesn’t
mean we would anybody would have any access to user logs. I
think the only outstanding action here is to find out around the
suspense account and the central.

How easy is it to get in there yeah.

Yes technically is it doable in branch by a user that’s logged onto
the system in branch and we'll take that action.

But this is pretty conclusive around the audit trail as to how the
amounts got transferred and from where.

But then surely if, if it’s got settle centrally then they would be
asking for the money?

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL Item 3

No sometimes they don’t they forget, pressure of work, I’ve had
cases where it’s been quite some time when all of a sudden
Chesterfield are on the phone saying “oh this error you had that
you settled centrally, we'd like our money now” and it’s been
months sometimes up to a year before they’ve contacted.

So it’s alright for them to be competent and you know pressures
of work this that and the other, hang on and yet if there are just
like these hundreds, 200, 300 Sub-Postmasters that I’ve been
talking to that have been suspended and you know they’re taking
action against the Post Office, it’s alright for them to make minor
errors and then the Post Office just thrown the book at them, yet
it’s alright for these guys to accept it as “oh you know we got
pressures of work we've got this we’ve got that etc etc’.

That’s not what we’re saying.

No not at all and it’s entirely, (indistinct) activities are entirely
unrelated.

If it's something settled centrally it’s taken out of the branch
system, what we are evidencing on the screen here that the
amounts weren't taken out of the branch system they were
moved around in the branch system, declared as being in a stock
unit when actually there was no physical stock or cash in that
stock unit.

Ok tell me this then please, these shortages were placed onto
pound notes.

Once it came out of suspense.

Yeah. This is where it all kicked off ok when as far as I am
concerned, it was a set up by Mick Searle ok I'll tell you that now
and it was a vendetta basically and all of you were conspirators
basically ok in the Post Office.

Sorry Val I’ve only just got involved.

I’m sorry but I’m going to speak my mind I’m not frightened to
open my mouth ok you can take whatever legal action you want
against me after ok and this is my opinion ok.

And you're entitled to your opinion yes.

And at the end of the day Mick Searle knew about this money
being put into pound notes, he was told that we done.

And how much was this?

No we haven't ascertained, you’re saying it’s conclusive bla bla, I
don’t accept it Mark’s not happy with it, are you happy no we
haven't got full, no hang on we're not satisfied I’m not satisfied
anyway ok until this further evidence of where this money has
come from ok so but anyway at the end of the day Mick was
asked right way back in February and March and April to find out
about this and he never came back. Your call centres were
asked, your helpline centres, Mick’s boss Andy was asked “why
didn’t you lot look at it, why didn’t somebody look at it, explain to
my wife exactly what the problem was”.

Val I can’t explain that, what I can, you’ve asked us to show.
Well you see this is it, you can’t explain it, you can’t explain it you
can’t explain yet your auditors came in and took the decision to
dismiss my wife.

On the basis of what the system said should be on hand wasn’t
on hand.

But hang on yeah we would have put, look we’re not short of
money right we’ve put in the tune of £6,000 in, hang on.

I’m not, Val I’m not disputing that.

In shortages, the problem is, the problem is we brought it to your
attention right at the onset, you did nothing about it and then 3
months later you threw the book at my wife, classed her as a
criminal.

What happened was.

You were incompetent that’s what happened.

I think I’m entitled to speak as well Val, what happened was when
the auditors have come to verify the cash and stock on hand
against what the system says.

Auditors in waiting basically because they were there within half
an hour.

That's irrelevant.

No it’s not irrelevant, it proves my point that this was a set up.
No it doesn’t

Why is it a setup?

Why was it a set up how come it took you 3 days, 3 days to get
the auditors to my office to re-open it and yet when Mick came in
there and made an error, when the auditors did come within half
an hour of call right they found the shortages to be exactly the
same as what my wife had made them the night before and yet
Mick and his side kick that Wendy counted the stock 3 times and
found it to be £1500 short, £1500 short how do you explain that,
they’re incompetent they couldn’t even count the stock and the
money correctly.

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL Item 3

Mick didn’t undertake the audit though did he?

I think we're moving into a separate little piece of this whole case
was the way was conducted, the audit wasn’t, was called
because people came to check stock and cash as part of the
Horizon preparations. I’ve recently discovered that you have tiers
of tolerance so any shortage found below I think it’s £1,000 the
people would just notify the Sub-Postmaster that if that’s still
there upon balance day that must be made good but if it’s above
a certain level, auditors are called in as a matter of precaution.
The cash and stock on that day had it been counted correctly by
Mick and the other lady that came, they wouldn’t have had the
need to call auditors in. They, for reasons that we could go into
but I don’t Know that it’s appropriate during this meeting to go
into, the reasons between the two of them I know at least one of
them is more than capable of counting stock and cash and they,
in my opinion said this branch is short by over £1,000 we’re
calling in the auditors so they forced an audit when one wasn’t
necessary and I believe that was the opinion of the auditor when
he came. However when the auditor verified that the state of the
office on that day was below tolerance levels, he did find this
entry on the £1 note line and he wasn’t happy about that and
reported it to the Contracts Manager that’s when the suspension
started and the rest is history so I can understand why Val’s
aggrieved that an audit was brought about, we wouldn’t be here
today if it wasn’t for the fact that that audit was called in
unnecessarily.

Yeah but had everything been.

And this should have been picked up by people checking cash on
hand at night because the repetitive entry of money on disused
notes should have been picked up as part of cash management.
Can I just kind of just back track a couple of.

So it couldn’t have gone on forever that’s what I’m trying to say.
Yeah but can I just backtrack, I mean I wasn’t on hand with Mick
and whoever else was there so and we can you know I don’t think
it’s right to assume that they enforced an audit, human error
could have occurred like we discussed earlier with Val so the
point is an audit was undertaken and there was found to be a
discrepancy so I think that’s the start point of this, not what went
on before and I think we have to take it from there. What we’ve
been asked to do is produce the information.

Yeah but that discrepancy Mick knew about it that’s the whole
point thought, if Mick had used his noddle instead of bringing this
vendetta into play Mick you know he could have sat down with my
wife and said “Rachpal can you just explain this to me” and that’s
where I would have turned round and said “well Mick first and
foremost it’s not £1500 short it’s only about 7, £800 short and you
know what there it is do you remember those pound note entries I
told you about in February, I told you about in March I told you in
April, Andy came here” etc etc they are nothing more than liars
because I've got evidence here of them saying.

Val who’s Andy?

Andy Thompson.

Andy Thomson.

You don’t even know your own organisation.

Well without a surname it’s difficult to pinpoint somebody called
Andy.

Had people had acted ‘cos there was calls for help during all this,
had people responded to those in the right way then this data
would have been produced, we’d still be left with the fact that this
audit trail shows that your stock unit transferred money from the,
your stock unit into a redundant stock unit which you have denied
so that’s where the (indistinct), there is this discrepancy you don’t
know how it occurred but it occurred in stock unit AA yours and it
was, according to those records, it was transferred out and
placed somewhere else.

On records that can’t be manipulated and have been clearly done
by the user that has a personal ID.

And that, to me to my way of thinking now we got the benefit of
this flow of events, there’s an impasse because your side of the
table’s saying it’s unequivocal there’s the evidence we produced
it and Rachpal’s saying.

And where are you on this Mark?

Sorry?

How do you see this?

Well I'd like to talk to Rachpal a bit further now we’ve had the
benefit of this because you know it is in the great scheme of
things in the sixe of this branch it is an insignificant amount of
money, it’s not the actions of someone who’s short of money and
trying to hide a huge loss and Rachpal’s remained steadfast
through this.

And Rachpal’s been reinstated.

Yeah.

And what I personally want to do on behalf of the business is
rebuild the relationship. I don’t, you know I’m not of a mind to,
we’re happy to share this information and give you more detailed
information, what I want to do genuinely want to do is build the
relationship going forward and try to put this behind us. It’s
caused a lot of grief on all sides and to our customers and what I
really want to do now is to say can we put this behind us, can we
build a relationship and you know can we take the business
forward and we want your business to be a success and we want
to support you in making that a success that’s where I’m coming
from.

‘cos the alternative is just for the path wells to go back into
dispute mode and say “actually we’re going to fight you to the end
over that amount of money ‘cos we never did that transfer it was
not, it may appear on there as us doing it but you'll have”.

And obviously there is always that option for you if that’s what you
wanted to do but that is not our preferred option, we do want to
build the relationship we want to take this, we want to draw a line
under it and we want to take this forward and that was the
purpose why I called this.

You can get very technical about this I mean there’s no doubt
about it this uses remote access software it’s designed as for
helpline operators to look at the account ‘cos all it is is an
administrative network system and there are levels of
administration which have certain access rights to individual
accounts otherwise you wouldn’t be able to get some of the help
you get over the helpline.

We can’t but we cannot go in and amend.

But physically yeah the issue of physically

Amend or transfer.

You know it’s one of the discussions I want to have with my
executive next week is to seek some form of laid out protocols
within Chesterfield as to what are the protocols of access. There
will be at some stage the technical potential for you to access a
cash account.

But not POL, nobody within the Post Office can do this Mark.

We are very very happy to sit down with you and your executive
and George and Vin as we’ve made on all occasions and discuss
that in lots of detail, be totally open with you and so you can
understand and we can build the confidence.

As you can appreciate it is a very simple computer at the end of
the day sitting at the end of an ISDN line and if someone knows
what they are doing, they could hack in, if they've got the access
rights but of course records would be kept to that somewhere
‘cos you can’t even look at a computer without it keeping a log of
what’s gone on.

As an audit trail.

But you know it is technically ultimately someone within Fujitsu
could get into a unit and do whatever they need to do.

Not without being seen to have done that Mark.

I mean this is military level security we've got within the Horizon
system, it’s highly encrypted, it’s very safe, it meets all the
external tests but I don’t know how you want to or what the way
forward is whether you want to speak to Rachpal.

Well you can appreciate that is evidence we've only seen today.
Yes of course it is and I’m not, we want you know.

What I was expecting from Andy when we had the appeal that he
agreed with me this has only happened by one or two ways either
this entry has happened from a mysterious or someone on the
team at Ferndown would be recorded as doing it, do you agree
with me and this now on paper for the first time of looking at it
has shown that that log on code was used to do that transfer.
Well they’ve had ample time to play around with it haven’t they
you know to manipulate it whichever way they want to and bring it
in otherwise Andy would have produced it at, you know he’s
supposed to be, excuse me he’s supposed to be the National
Appeals Manager, National Appeals Manager and a guy on tape
goes round saying he will spare no cost he will produce all these
(indistinct)

Well would it make you feel better if Kevin explains perhaps.
They're just bullies nothing else.

Why Kevin didn’t deliver do you want to know.

Why Kevin didn’t deliver?

Sorry why Andy Bayfield didn’t deliver his undertaking?

When I got involved in it there was an action to produce the log, it
takes time to produce the log, there’s considerable cost to
produce the log.

But Carol Ballan had from the day she suspended me to produce
this log for 6 months she had to do that Carol Ballan.

And we've got, all I can say is we’ve got the log now you know we
can share the log with you.

But why did he go and make a decision to terminate the contract
without completing the action he set himself?

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL Item 3

‘Cos he felt at the time he had sufficient information to do that, I
think the issue.

He didn’t have that.

I think the issue now Mark is that Rachpal has been reinstated
so.

It's not a point we're not here about that now Mark’s asked you a
specific question you answer that question never mind that
Rachpal’s been reinstated.

The answer to that question is we don’t normally need to get the
logs out, in most appeals and Mark you'll know this, we don’t get,
we don’t go back on the logs because we've got confidence in the
system in exceptional cases.

But he did say he needed that log to make his decision.

Yeah he did.

And all I can say is without understanding the facts that Andy did,
that was an error if he promised that and he didn’t do it he should
have done it and we've.

He made his decision even before, even before receiving our
comments. He hadn't even received the comments and he sent
back by special delivery my termination.

Sorry you attended an appeal with Andy didn’t you?

We attended appeal, he sent his notes back to say do you agree
with these notes or not, we hadn't been given the chance to send
those back and the next day the special delivery came to say I
agree with Carol Ballan and.

You've been dismissed etc.

Dismissed you, your contract is terminated.

So he was under instructions basically right from the onset
doesn’t matter what you say bla bla.

No it wasn’t it wasn't.

Yes he was.

No he wasn't.

Listen to me please. I’m not some riff raff that you're talking I’ve
been in the business myself 25 years ok right I’ve built
businesses left right and centre.

Excuse me I hope I’ve given no impression whatsoever well I
know.

You guys have bullied my wife out of her job basically and sold
and other 100 odd Sub-Postmasters that are waiting in line to see
you guys.

Have I treated you like riff raff during any of this.

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL Item 3

You're insulting my intelligence by telling me that it’s not the case
when it blatantly is

No I’ve not that is not the case that is not the case.

Can I just ask you one question, what action have you actually
taken against Andy Bayfield for making (indistinct).

Do you see that there,

This is.

Hang on let me, do you see that there, well why does the stamp
there say it’s a dealer issued, dealer issued road fund licence, my
daughter was accused of nicking this out of the Ferndown office
and Carol Ballan had this, Andy Bayfield had this right.

Just one of the side issues that were involved in the original
(indistinct) suspension.

Theft they said she stole this licence.

What we're trying to do, what we’re trying to do here is establish
the facts the transfer we’ve produced this evidence today, we've
reinstated Rachpal what we're trying to do is rebuild the
relationship, that was the purpose of this meeting I mean I
wanted this to be a constructive meeting and that’s.

But it’s been constructive in so much as we’ve you know we’ve
got some information that would have stopped all of this a lot
earlier on so you know thank you for getting this in that level of
detail we can see what the audit trail is showing. Rachpal is still
disputing that she actually did that transfer. I’ve got to have a talk
to her now to say what do you want to do, the business is saying
that is you, they would show that in any forum and say this is our
evidence it will be Rachpal’s word against.

Well let’s get an independent expert on it then let’s get the Fujitsu
to sign it off.

Well that’s what I want to talk to you two about how far do you
want to take this.

Let’s get an independent expert on it to sign off these reports etc.
That's her word against ours basically so it requires an
independent expert.

Well again it’s not quite your word against theirs.

But the balls in their court to prove us wrong, I’m innocent until
proven guilty no.

I think we’ve produced the.

That’s your manipulated figures as far as I’m concerned, you get
an independent expert on there I can’t see that that’s been
underwritten by Fujitsu of your partners, you haven’t written this
software or whatever, these systems are not even yours, let me
have a look at your partnership agreement with Fujitsu which
states how you have to handle this data.

I can assure you there is not way that this information that we’re
sharing with you has been.

Get an independent to verify that then. Well get an independent.
We're more than happy to share this information for you to take
this away.

Get a declaration by an independent expert to verify that then.
You shouldn't have any problem with that should you?

This is all, every key stroke that’s made is. None of these could
be.

Look we are not going to see eye to eye here, you get an
independent expert with a declaration to confirm that then.

We are very confident that our systems are.

You may well be I’m not.

Well we can share this information.

I’ve been through the system you don’t know what you put us
through for 6 months. You are nothing more than bully boys
basically you’ve bullied us out of a job.

And I don’t agree with that whatsoever.

No you wouldn't.

So what you’re saying to bring this to a conclusion is that, but
obviously this is your evidence and you’re prepared to stand
behind and you're also prepared to sort of say right if the Athwals
are, they’re not going to be happy but if they are prepared to draw
a line under this then the relationship moves forward as is this
never happened.

That’s what the purpose of this meeting was to do.

This letter is a formal confirmation that although there is no legal
obligation, what arrogance, this letter’s nothing more than
arrogance, arrogant attitude.

I’m not sure that this helping (indistinct).

But anyway we are at this point when the business is saying you
can take this further and it will tae a long time to resolve or you
can right well is it worth it for that sort of money, you are back to
work you've got your contract, your records not marked in any
way and as Kevin's just saying it never happened and it will just
leave a horrible taste in your mouth for the rest of your careers
and the Post Office but there is issues to discuss media outside
of this meeting to do with the way help is provided when a Sub-
Postmaster says “I think it’s the system.” There is no-one to turn
to that could get their hands on the sufficient information to prove
to the postmaster actually no it’s down to your branch.

As I say we're very happy to talk to you and your exec around.
We definitely need a much better system when someone calls IT
issues into question, we don’t seem to have a robust process to
be able to handle that but I’m happy to leave that to our
negotiators who meet you on these matters to come up with a
system ‘cos we've got dispute procedures for rems but we
bizarrely haven’t got one to deal with Horizon in a robust enough
way and I think cost inhibits that but I think we don’t want a
repetition of this sort of thing I think we might need to look, try to
find a way of resolving a Postmasters concerns when he thinks
his computers gone wrong, it should be a lot easier these days
whenever they’ve been moved online but you can never be sure
but I'll need to talk to these two now and decide you know how far
do they want to take this and you’ve made your case quite clear
you've got your evidence.

Do you want to continue to use this room?

Do you want to discuss is then come for a break and then?

We can go for a little break if you want.

I'll tell you the situation as I see it ok.

Yeah I mean there are issues I still want to have a chat with these
guys about, there’s other issues you know at the end of the day,
excuse me my wife is happy in the job she’s doing, she'll continue
to do that you know I have got issues that you know as a result of
what they put my wife through right I have suffered, I was buying
4 Post Offices and I’m dedicated. You know these guys I tell you
what I told Nigel Allen, I’ve known Nigel Allen for some years you
know and I said to Nigel when all this kicked off I said “Nigel
come on mate you know you and I go

back a long time” I said “let’s sit down and let’s go through it
because you know we’re not short of money and there’s no way
we would have tried to fiddle the system right” I says “you know
I’m an accountant I would oversee all these figures etc it’s my
business my wife runs it with my daughter and staff right” do you
know what he just pushed me away I said “Nigel look don’t push
me away please because I am going to fight you I am not going to
stop” and I am still not going to stop until these guys come out
with some explanations as to how they (1) are going to
compensate my wife for the life that they put her through for 6
months, secondly how are they like you have just said, what
about all the other poor chaps that have lost seen, she’s been
sent to prison, Rabeen has been sent to prison, Mrs. Uppal,
Jackie’s in Court, I’m going to Court on Monday Jackie, that’s
Monday, Mrs. Uppal’s in Court on you know the 17", all these
things how are these guys going to deal with all the other issues
now you know, how are we going to move forward?

835 MB _ I’m sure they’re aware of all these cases that are going on and
you know the executive, I’ve already flagged this is up to
(indistinct) that with all this talk of mutualisation and everything
else that you know this sort of stuffs got to be sorted out before
we can come close to even.

836 VA _ I mean are they 6 months down the road going to come banging
on our door and harass my wife again.

837 MB Well no I think there’s lessons to be learned and I’m sure Kevin
will even admit that there’s even lessons to be learned with the
way your particular case was handled.

838 VA Mark you know the day of the audit right, seriously, I’m sorry to, I
apologise for interrupting but do you know the day of the audit
right I've got 6 women working there right, big heft blokes turned
up 4 of them intimidating women basically, bully boys that’s what
they are and when I challenged them they’re not even auditors
and yet they go round claiming to be auditors.

839 KG _ Well they don’t need to be qualified auditors.

840 VA __ They're stock takers. I’m a qualified auditor I belong the
Chartered Institute of auditors I cannot go round saying I’m an
auditor unless I have some qualification.

841 KG _ They don’t claim to be qualified auditors and never have, they’re
qualified to.

842 VA __ They couldn't even explain the losses to me.

843 KG __ They’re qualified to do the job that.

844 VA __ What job, stock take that’s all they are.

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL Item 3

Well Val, well effectively that’s what they’re doing on sight isn’t it,
your system says that’s what should be on hand, they verify if
that’s on hand or not and if there’s a difference that’s what's
declared it doesn’t mean.

Well if there’s a difference they've got to first and foremost show
us where that difference is, how have they derived at that
difference basically.

Yes and they would.

They couldn’t explain that to me.

No what they would do to you is say that’s the stock figure, do
you agree that’s the stock figure, that’s the cash figure do you
agree, that’s what the system says should be there.

Well in our case there was £400 transferred out of the safe into a
stock unit registered to unemployee who wasn’t even working
that day and he couldn't explain to me how that was.

Well how could they explain because they weren’t on sight when
that would have happened. They’re there.

Same as you couldn't explain that, exactly.

Val they're there to check what's on sight.

Do you then agree that there’s a problem with your computer
system or not, is there a glitch in the computer system?

No there’s not.

No well why wasn’t he able to prove this 400 transfer then, if
there wasn’t a glitch in the system then he should have been able
to pin point something along the line oh look.

You claim there’s a glitch in the system in reference to the
£436.81p.

And the £400 on the audit that they carried out.

We have demonstrated from the information that we have.

No you haven't you've satisfied yourself you haven't satisfied me.
Well I have satisfied myself yes because I have seen the
information and that is down to a user at Ferndown under a
password only known to that person who has accessed that
system, nobody else could have done that so therefore I am
satisfied that that was not a glitch in the system.

But the £400 transferred out of the safe into a stock unit with a
recipient on that stock unit wasn’t even logged on, didn’t even
work that day, how do you explain that?

Well I haven't looked at the evidence so I can’t but I am sure
given that I am confident in the system.

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL Item 3

Hang on hang on you haven't looked at it, somebody’s looked at
that information do you know why because that was part and
parcel of the transfer of the office back to my wife when she was
reinstated so where (1) I wanted to know where is that money
gone to, how have you written that money off is it going to come
back into play just like that £400 odd.

Well that was the transfer of stock from the temporary Sub-
Postmaster over to your wife so the shortage there if there was a
shortage.

Would not have been transferred to Rachpal.

Would not have been transferred to you, that’s not, I can’t see
that as.

What Chris said to me was oh you know what I’m going to
transfer it out of your office into a account suspense account “oh
are you can you let me have details of this suspense account” “ er
er no because I don’t know where it is, what you’re an auditor
you're transferring figures of our my office into a suspense.”

This is really.

No hang on this proves that you guys don’t even know what’s
going on here, he’s transferred money out of my office into a
suspense account, these are Chris’ words the head auditor and
you can bring him here if he’s here right and I asked him to show
me details of the stock or the suspense account that he was
transferring that money into and he didn’t have a clue where it
was held.

Well surely, surely all that’s important to you was to make sure
that the stock and cash that was transferred to your wife was the
correct amount.

And I was happy to sign that but I was not happy to sign the
shortages which he wanted me to sign, I said no I am not going to
sign those.

As I understand it.

And do you know why then he went off in a huff, he threw his toys
out of the pram and buggered off only to come back an hour later.
But we didn’t ask you take any shortages or any loss.

You wanted me to sign for those shortages, why did you want me
to sign them then?

I think just as a record that he’d been there and that’s what he
had found in the branch he wasn’t trying to get you to accept
those shortages at all. I think.

Well the point is this then Kevin, the point is this, where have
those shortages gone, how do I know that they’re not just hiding
in the system somewhere and they'll come back.

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL Item 3

879 KG _ Because, because you took over the amount of cash and stock
that you agreed to do and that was net of the shortages so the
shortages weren't there so.

880 VA Nono the shortages are there and they'll just keep on rolling over
rolling over, they may be hidden away in some suspense account
and then 6 months down the road, just like this figure has just
appeared from a suspense account when we haven't put it into a
suspense account, my wife hasn’t put it into a suspense account
he has told me he’s put it into a suspense account.

881 KG _ Well! think we're (indistinct) ‘cos we’ve got evidence, we've got
evidence that.

882 VA _ Money was in the suspense account, who’s put it there you
haven't got that evidence?

883 KG We have we’ve got the user ID, we've got the user ID and the
only person that can get access to that user ID is the person
registered to it and with the password, we’ve got evidence that
that happened it was transferred from a stock to the suspense
account and then back into the stock.

884 VA __ Sojust like that £400 from the safe to a stock unit where the
employee wasn't even working, simple.

885 KG We have categoric evidence of all those. It’s very very.

886 VA _ I've got categorical evidence showing £400 from my safe into a till
when the employee wasn’t even logged on.

887 KG _ It was a transfer.

888 MB _ If! could have just say 5, 10 minutes we think so we can sort of
bring this meeting to an end and both decide what your next
move will be but you’ve stated what your next move would like to
be is that this all, from this day on.

889 KG _ And draw a line under it and we move forward.

890 MB _ Yeah subject to some tidying up some things which will leave it to
normal protocol’s to do that. Again you know there’s lessons to
be learnt and we don’t want a repetition of this type of thing
happening again simply because from the very beginning the
whole matter wasn’t handled in a very professional way.

891 KG _ What we need is the relationship to be put on a firm footing a
positive footing.

892 MB __ Yeah with regard to the branch yeah.

893 KG  Sowecan work together that’s what we would like that’s what we
want from this.

894 MB _ Ok.

895 VA _ Andy Bayfield said it was handled very unprofessionally do you
accept that?

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL Item 3

What I want to do is draw a line under this and move forward.
You know we've said I’ve reinstated Rachpal we’ve give you the
back pay we want to build a relationship we don’t want, you know
whatever the evidence shows, we now want to move forward we
want to put it on a professional footing, want this to be positive
because you know we want your business to succeed and we
want to help you make it succeed so that’s what we want.

If I could just have say 5 or 10 minutes to talk to them.

I'll knock this off Mark and then take this with me ok.

Well I’ve spoken to Rachpal at length and explained everything
that we’ve heard this afternoon and thank you for all the evidence
that’s been produced. I mean I think it goes without saying that if
that had been produced a lot earlier on in this case we wouldn't
perhaps have to be here today. Although Rachpal is still not
prepared to accept that she did that transfer but she appreciates
that the would require her to back that up with evidence and that
would take an enormous amount of time, it would involve
litigation and she’s just not prepared to go down that road to
argue what would essentially be a point of principle and a matter
of honour for her. She’s heard your offer that the business is
prepared to draw a line under this case and she thinks that’s the
most pragmatic way forward and that’s what Rachpal would like
to do.

Ok

Ok obviously she doesn’t want to have any sort of further
repercussions, she’s not prepared, she doesn’t want to be treated
as a special case she doesn’t want any sort of like snidy remarks
or further comment made.

And I give you my personal assurances that won't be the case.
Ok and as I say we'll have to draw a line under this and just move
forward as if it never happened. The federation will want to take
up certain issues because the case was particularly badly
handled by management all the way down the line but I don’t
want to sort of open up those wounds at this meeting, we'll leave
that to the appropriate channels.

And we’re very happy to talk to you as always

Yeah but I’ve made the offer to Lyn before she concluded the
case or before she moved onto other things, said that what’s at
fault here really is procedures and processes and I’ve got some
experience in those in how to deal with disciplinary matters and
perhaps we could set up something a bit better for the future but
that offer’s still there.

As I say we're always looking to, if we can improve the process
we're always looking to.

I think quite right I think that’s a separate conversation.

Yes it’s business as usual between the Post Office and the
Federation. I think we can, we definitely do need a system or a
process in place where a postmaster can say “actually I think I’ve
got some IT issues” there isn’t actually a body of people to turn to
that could parachute in and alley fears and talk the postmaster
through, roughly in the same way as occurred today but again
we'll talk about doing that. Just one other thing. Obviously there’s
been, dragging from the closure of Ferndown Post Office there’s
been media interest and all three of us have been approached by
the media and have given interviews but I for one will be making
a statement to the journalist I spoke to to say as far as I’m
concerned the business has dealt with the matter in a propriate
way Rachpal is moving on with her career as a postmaster. My
main comment to the journalist doing the programme was around
the lack of processes in dealing with these such issues. I didn’t
make any comment on Horizon being inheritently at fault
technically. I said you have to accept individual PC’s can go
wrong and that’s how I felt at the time but now I’ve had the benefit
of this information I'll be able to go back and say it was shown to
me that the system perhaps maybe did not go wrong and there
were other issues around it so I will clarify although it may be too
late for their programme, I will be making a statement to sort of
tidy up what I said to them but there will be TV programmes
about this case but the main programme is being launched by the
group that is threatening legal action against the business since
programmes instigated by that group. We were just dragged into
it because Ferndown was a live case so just heads up that you
might see us on television over the next few days.

And what’s programme is this Mark?

I think it’s called, it’s inside out but I think it’s localised so it will be
just in the South.

Right ok.

Alright thank you very much for your time.

Can I just add to what Mark has said that what he’s discussed
here with you guys is obviously to do with my wife and Ferndown
Post Office. What I want to do is my business basically. I will
carry on speaking to the media, I will give an interview and I will
tell them that I have seen this information in my opinion it’s
nothing more than just an excel spreadsheet made up by you
guys and you know I don’t agree with it but that’s my choice.

Do you still want the disc copies of the information that we’ve

Sorry.

Do you still want the disc copies of the information we’ve
retrieved from Fujitsu.

I want somebody to independently verify those excel.

No what I’m saying is do you want a copy of the discs that I said
we would give you, do you still want that?

Well yeah if you let us have those discs yeah but those entries
there as much as my wife disagrees with those, you know you will
obviously you know, I’m agreeing to disagree until such time as
you can provide evidence by an independent witness and
declaration that those are the true entries then I’m not prepared
to accept them and I will go on record to say that and furthermore
please I have got a lot of interviews lined up, I am going to carry
on my programme unless obviously you want to talk to me
independently.

The purpose of the meeting was around Rachpal as the Sub-
Postmistress, we’ve concluded that, our relationship, ongoing
relationship is with Rachpal under the terms of the contract as
we've entered into so that’s where we stand.

I can’t tell Val what to do but I did advise him to be very careful
what he does and say you know as part of our discussions I said
well yeah we can force this to verification but it will take an awful
long time an awful lot of money and awful lot of pain and anx,
going down that road just to verify what you’ve shown us today
but I know you particular and I can’t imagine for a moment you
would authorise someone to sit down and just type out that
information to make it fit you know. I have to take your word as a
professional person that you wouldn’t do that.

Well I've got the community backing behind me. I’m happy to talk
to my community leaders and I’ve got an interview lined up with
them tomorrow in the Midlands and I shall continue you know. At
the end of the day I haven’t seen an apology from these guys
they’re not made to apologise for their, they're not made to
compensate for the 6 months of harassment what they put my
wife and my family through, labelled us as criminals basically
thieves, those were the words used you know, false accounting
and theft you know we were criminals.

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL Item 3

923 MB _ The way it’s handled is in a way a separate issue Val and it’s the
way that this case was handled that I’ll ask people within our
executive to discuss to see if we can use different language and
take a different approach when having to deal with postmasters
over such sensitive issues ‘cos there was a little bit of jack boots
first type attitude that went on with the way Ferndown was
handled and that just compounded the problem. Now we've got
down to the nuts and bolts and the main facts of the case it’s
become clearer and had we had that data right at the beginning
and I think basic contracts manager should have had that data to
prove their case in the first place and as I say it wouldn’t have
snowballed up the chain of command where we have to involve
directors in dealing with something which quite honestly a
contracts manager could have dealt with.

924 AB _ Sowe'll have the conversation separately.

925 MB _ ButasI say that’s best taken away and spoken about as in
normal business that the federation has with you.

926 AB Ok thank you very much.
