Hi Gayle, Kendra

Following on from your conversations with Kizzie about the NBSC, please find attached an extract from the draft
Defence which relates to this area. I have also attached a copy of the claim which Post Office is responding to and is
referred to within the Defence.

It would be much appreciated if you could review the extract and provide any comments which you may have. In
particular, if there are any points which are incorrect, please could you flag and explain these.

Apologies for the short notice, but would it be possible to complete this review by close of business on Friday, 7 June?

Kind regards

Amy
