Dear Mr Bates

Horizon System

Thank you for your letters of 17 December 2003 and 7 January 2004. I note that
Betty Williams has written to Allan Leighton.

I can go no higher within the Royal Mail group than Allan Leighton, and I am sure
that your Member of Parliament will have as much, if not more, success than I would.
Hopefully, therefore, you will have further information from that route.

In relation to errors which members considered were due to Horizon problems, the
Executive Council set up a Joint Federation/Post Office Ltd group who visit the
Horizon helpline site to discuss and resolve issues. It is my understanding that Post
Office Ltd can trace the nature of any error including telephone calls relating to the
same when the Horizon System is in question and, therefore, should be able to
produce evidence that all is, in fact, correct from their side.

We are not in a position to provide information regarding other Subpostmaster's
dealings with Post Office Lid. We are aware that there were some disputes around
the time that offices migrated from the manual system to the Horizon System, but we
are now of the view that Horizon works well and that there are no real problems in
Post Offices which are operated by the Horizon System.
