Tam not sure whether Andy Parsons is deliberately missing the point or looking for room to
manoeuvre following my conversation with Jarnail yesterday. He focusses on Harry’s indication
that something should not be said without noting that the proposed concession was linked to a
sometimes incorrect analysis of the case.

I get the feeling this will become a subject for a tele conf today.

Martin

I've read through the advice on M029. in a couple of places Harry has indicated that we shoul ot state that, when
this case is compared to POL's current practices, things would have been done differently. From the meeting with
you and Simon, my understanding was that this type of approach would be acceptable. Could you confirm whether
POL may proceed on this basis or whether it needs to do things differently?

This may be easier to discuss — I'm around before 10am tomorrow and then after about 3pm.

Kind regards
Andy
