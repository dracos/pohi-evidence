Hi Oliver,

To confirm POL can do this time slot.

Could you forward me the invite so I can put it in relevant diaries?

I'll prepare the briefing in advance — does close 28" work as a deadline for it?
Cheers,

Josh

Hi James,

Background to this meeting in attached e-mail chain. Alan / Gillian to note that the steer at the time
from Ash was that SoS need not attend this, though view might have changed since.

Josh / Beth & Eleanor — could you please socialise this date (01 September 2020 16:00-17:00) with
POL colleagues to check that it works for them?

Many thanks,

Oliver
