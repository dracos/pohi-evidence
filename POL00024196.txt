Dial in details:

As per before, these calls are intended to be shorter than the meetings and to focus only on issues raised. As such, I do
not intend to circulate:

e Agendas - unless a specific point is raised beforehand by an attendee on behalf of the area of the business that
they represent; or

@ Open actions — unless they are urgent. I will pick these up with the individuals outside of the call and or in the
F2F meetings.

Many thanks
Mark
