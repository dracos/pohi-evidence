          Introduction

      1. This witness statement is made to assist the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry (the

          Inquiry) with the matters                      out        the Rule 9 Request dated 24th October 2023

          (the Request).

                                                                                                    Vt November
          with an LL.B (Hons) degree in Law. I was admitted as a Solicitor on

          1996. 1 subsequently became a Criminal Defence Duty Solicitor and was later

          awarded the Higher Courts (Criminal) Qualification in or around October 2007.
      3. l was employed by Messrs Cartwright King Solicitors (Cartwright King) from 2006

          until 2016. During my employment I was promoted to the position of
                                                                                                           Senior




          Associate                           and developed an interest in Road Transport Law.

                                                                               W ITN09680100




4. l left the employment of Cartwright King and together with Simon Clarke and

   Harry Bowyer, in-house Counsel at Cartwright King, established the firm of

   Clarke Tinkler LLP in 2016, which traded as Smith Bowyer Clarke. It specialised

   in the provision of legal advice and representation in Road Transport Law. The

   new firm also continued to provide advice, on a consultancy basis, through

   Cartwright King for a period. I held the positions of COLP (Compliance Officer for

   Legal Practice) and COFA (Compliance Officer for Finance and Administration)

   at Smith Bowyer Clarke.
5. I left Smith Bowyer Clarke at the outset of the Covid-19 pandemic in March 2020.

   I subsequently accepted employment with Vienna Kang Advocates Ltd, which

   specialises in Criminal Defence and now has several offices in various locations

   throughout England. I am a senior member of the Management Team at Vienna

   Kang Advocates Ltd.
6. I do not have any access to the files and records held by Cartwright King relating

   to the work which I undertook for Post Office Ltd. It follows that this statement
   has been prepared having regard to the documents provided with the Request

   for a Rule 9 Witness Statement and from my memory. I have attempted to

   recollect events and the content of this statement represents the best of my

   recollection as at the date of this statement.

7. It is my recollection that Cartwright King were first instructed to advise in

   connection with some of the cases being investigated and considered for

   Prosecution in advance of the date upon which Post Office Ltd became

   independent of the Royal Mail Group, which I believe was 1st April 2012.
8. It is my understanding that Mr. Andrew (Andy) Cash, the Solicitor responsible for
   the supervision of the Derby Office of Cartwright King, had previously been used

   as a local agent by the Criminal Law Team of the Royal Mail Group to prosecute

   cases in Derbyshire.

       believe




   sought would have been submitted by the Criminal Law Team of the Royal Mail

   Group. The files were simply delivered without any form of handover or

   discussion. I cannot recall the precise arrangements for the submission of case

   files by Post Office Ltd thereafter. I believe, however, that any advice prepared

   by Cartwright King, along with any draft charges, would have                                                                                       considered

10.'1 was based at the Derby office of Cartwright King. Work on case files submitted

       by Post Office Ltd was also undertaken at offices in Nottingham and Leicester.

11:Whilst I was working on Post Office Ltd case files, I became aware that

       independent auditors by the name of Second Sight had been appointed to report

       on the reliability of Horizon Online at the request of Members of Parliament. It

       was my understanding that                                                           Office Ltd had agreed                       the appointment to

   Reviewing    & Drafting Policies Concerning Criminal Investigations

   Prosecutions

13. It is my recollection that Cartwright King were asked on occasions to provide

   input or comment in relation to policies and procedures relating to criminal

   investigations and prosecutions.



   and the email from Dave Posnett to Helen Dickinson of the same date

   (POL00122531)-both refer to a recent meeting at which I had been in attendance.

   It would appear that the meeting had taken place on loth June 2013, but I cannot

   recall it due to the length of time which has since elapsed. It does, however,

   appear that one of the points discussed was the accurate recording of significant

   statements made to auditors relating to potential shortfalls. Another related to the

   gathering of documentary exhibits.

15. The email of Andrew Wise of 20th September 2013 (POL00122860) addressed

   to numerous recipients including Jarnail Singh and myself contained the subject

   line "Conduct of Criminal Investigations Meeting —25/9113". Due to the length of

   time which has since elapsed I cannot recall whether the meeting took place. I

   am also unable to recall whether I provided any advice with regard to any of the

   attachments to the email or in relation to any specific questions.

   same date in which she asked for confirmation as to who, outside of the Security

   Operations Team, might be invited to attend a meeting. It was noted by Helen

   Dickinson that I had previously been invited to a meeting. The subject of the

   Discussing the Conduct of Criminal Investigation Policy.'

17.1 have seen an email between Rob King and John Scott of 13th November 2013

   (P0L00123099) which contains suggested opening notes for the SECOPS

   Workshop on 20th November 2013. I cannot recall this Workshop and as I have

   previously indicated, I do not have access to any of the notes or records held by




   of the Draft Prosecution Policy produced by Simon Clarke. I believe this was

   produced at the request of Mrs. Susan Crichton who was General Counsel to

   Post Office Ltd at the time.

19. On 27th February 2014 Mr. Andy Hayward of the Post Office Ltd Security Team

   forwarded to Craig Tuthill and myself an email (P0L00123190) along with a

   document entitled `Raising Cases for Investigation' (POL00123191). I do not

   recall providing any advice in relation to this. I note, however, that in paragraph

   two it was noted that the Audit Team had placed a £20,000 threshold on

   `anomalies for potential audit' and that Contract Advisors would 'not now

   precautionary suspend as a matter of course.'

20.The email from Jarnail Singh to John Scott, Laura Irvine of BTO Solicitors and

   myself on 29th August 2013 (POL00139868) set out a suggested process for

   Scottish cases. It was proposed that prior to any file being submitted to the Crown

   Office and Procurator Fiscal Service for consideration of prosecution, it should

   first be submitted to                King for a search to take place of the central
                           Cartwright




   record of the weekly Horizon conference call. The document entitled `Scottish

   Prosecution Process' (POL00125068) indicates that this became
                                                                          an

   process'. I cannot however recall whether any case files were actually submitted

   to Cartwright King in accordance with this process.

21. Following the release of the draft Second Sight Interim Report, Simon Clarke had

   advised that Post Office Ltd should hold a weekly conference call so that a central

   record could be compiled capturing all Horizon related information in one place.

   The information collated by the call would enable Post Office Ltd to satisfy its

   duties of disclosure.

   The Provision of Training in Respect of Criminal investigations and

   Prosecutions

22.After Post Office Ltd became independent of the Royal Mail Group, Jamail Singh

   asked Cartwright King to provide training on a periodical basis to members of the

   Investigation Team. Although I was the main point of contact, Simon Clarke and

   Harry Bowyer were also involved with the provision of training.

23. Whilst there may have been requests for training on particular topics, other topics

   may have been suggested as a result of issues which had come to light in case

   files. By way of example, Cartwright King had advised against proceeding with

   one particular case as an auditor had actively questioned the Sub-Postmaster

   about how a shortage in the branch had arisen       i.e. an extensive interview had

   taken place but not under caution.

24.1 believe that I delivered training in relation to the interview process, interview

   techniques and styles of questioning. The general objective of this training was

   to help ensure that interviews were conducted properly and fairly with a view to

   ensuring that the best evidence would be obtained.

25. The email of 15t' February 2013 between Dave Posnett and Helen Dickinson

   (POL00129303), into which Jarnail Singh and I were copied, referred to the

                                     Page 6 of 42
                                                                                WITNO9680100
                                                                              W ITN 09680100




   possibility of training being provided by Cartwright King in relation to awkward

   interviewees, significant statements, points to prove, interviewing techniques

   etc'. Mr. Posnett sent an email on 22nd March 2013 (POL00129310) to myself,

   Jarnail Singh and members of the Security Team noting that the proposed topics

   would include, in addition to those listed above, a number of other topics

   including `pre-interviewing/caution'. It would appear that this training day was

   scheduled to take place at the Birmingham Office of Cartwright King.

26.The email from Dave Posnett of 3'd June 2013 addressed to myself and Mr.

   Jamail Singh (POL00122518) made reference to a proposed training day to be

   held at the Birmingham Office of Cartwright King on 11th June 2013 and also a

   Mock Trial Day on 18th September 2013which, it was proposed, would take place

   at the Galleries of

   Ltd (Fujitsu), to provide expert evidence in a number of cases which it

   prosecuted. This was not regarded as ideal given that Mr. Jenkins was not

   independent.

28. In his email to Andy Cash of 12th September 2012 (POL00020489) Jarnail Singh

   commented that he had "in the past instructed Gareth Jenkins of Fujitsu in the

   case of Misra which incidental was the only challenge`on Horizon... Perhaps we

   need to reconsider whether to instruct him as he may be viewed too close to the

   system but instruct Somebody entirely independent? Your thoughts please also

   whether you or Harry have anybody in mind."

        "Jarnail:

          would have preferred someone entirely independent but this is such a

      specialist area that we would be hard pushed to get a report in the timescale that
       we require — we may open our expert up to allegations of partiality but his

       expertise will be unlikely to be challenged.

       We need to get this report off the skids as soon as possible as we have PCMH's

       and trials galloping up on us.

       You should have had my advice of July but should you want further input as to
       the general content please get in touch,




    30. 1 have been shown a copy of a short email chain which consists of an email from
I
       Jarnail Singh to Gareth Jenkins of 1t October 2012 and Mr. Jenkins' response

       of the same date (FUJ00226331). l was copied into both emails. It is evident from
1

       Jarnail Singh's email that he sought an expert's report with a view to confirming

       that the Horizon System was robust. It               appear that he had attached a
                                                    would

       of the challenges had been successfully argued and asked that Mr Jenkins

       consider the spreadsheet.

    31. Mr Jenkins replied later the same day attaching two existing reports which it

       would appear were entitled "Horizon Data Integrity' (FUJ00226333) and "Horizon

       Online Data Integrity for Post Office Ltd" (FUJ00226332). He alluded to a

       conversation with Jarnail Singh in which he had mentioned these reports and

       indicated that he would prepare a further report within the next few days.

32. In his email of 4th October 2012 to Gareth Jenkins (FUJO0153812), into which I

   was also copied, Jarnail Singh appears to have enclosed a draft statement for

   Gareth Jenkins consideration and requested the documents referred to in

   paragraph 3.

33. It is my belief that an updated version of the draft statement would have

   subsequently been sent to me by email given that I wrote to Gareth Jenkins and

   Jamail Singh by email on 5th October 2012 (FUJ00156655). According to the

   email I had amended Mr. Jenkins' statement so as to exhibit the documents

   referred to in Section 3. It would appear to be the case that Sharron Jennings, a

   Post Office Investigator, produced the witness statement and asked Mr. Jenkins

   to check it carefully before signing it, to ensure that he was "happy" with it. The

   email chain reveals that later the same day I informed Mr. Jenkins that I had

   served his statement in a particular case.

34.1 do not believe that I was present during any of the conversations which Jarnail

    Singh may have had with Gareth Jenkins in relation to the preparation of his draft

    witness statement nor with regard to his role as an expert witness. As Mr. Jenkins

    had previously been used as an expert witness by Post Office Ltd, I anticipated

    that he would have been aware of the existence and nature of the duty owed by

    an expert witness to the Court.

 35.1 was of the opinion that the use of Gareth Jenkins was not ideal because, as

    Harry Bowyer had pointed out, he was employed by and not independent of

    Fujitsu. There was clearly a risk of a conflict of interest_ It was my understanding,

    however, that Mr. Jenkins had provided expert evidence in court previously. He

    had also said, taking his statement of 15th January 2013 (FUJ00124229) as an

                                                                                                      W ITN09680100




    example, that "my role is to assist the court rather than represent the views of my

    employers or Post Office Ltd."

36.1 also noted that the statement which Mr. Jenkins had signed contained the

    declaration, "This statement (consisting of 11 pages each signed by me) is true

    to the best of my knowledge and belief and I make it knowing that, if it is tendered

    in evidence, I shall be liable to prosecution if I have wilfully stated in it anything

    which I know to be false or do not believe true."

37_ It is        these circumstances that I did not anticipate that Mr. Jenkins' lack of
            in




    independence would become an issue.

38. In addition to having contact with Mr. Jenkins regarding to the preparation of this

    statement, I had contact with him on other occasions too. I was often copied into

    emails sent by my colleagues, Andrew Bole and Rachel Panter, Andrew Bole

    was a Solicitor who worked in the Cartwright King office in Leicester and Rachel

    Panter mainly worked in the office in Nottingham. I believe that Rachel Panter
    held a paralegal role within Cartwright King and that she would liaise with and
    forward documents to Post Office Ltd, Gareth Jenkins and Counsel in respect of

    individual case files.

                                                                     emails

    44. The Audit Report (POL00056292) in this case revealed

                         Mrs Hutchings was interviewed on 20th April 2011. At the commencement of the

                                 interview under caution (POL00056532), a prepared statement was read out

       on behalf of Mrs. Hutchings. In her prepared statement Mrs. Hutchings indicated

       that her branch had migrated to Horizon Online in or around the May or June of

       2010. She explained that at the point of migration, all accounts balanced. She

       also asserted that since the migration, the balances had been wrong and gave

       examples of the difficulties which she suggested she had experienced with

       Horizon Online; Mrs. Hutchings accepted that she had altered cash declarations,

       but not with a view to making a gain for herself or causing a loss to another. She

       denied stealing any money but explained that she had altered the cash

       declarations in order to continue to operate the branch.

    45. When the file was submitted to the Criminal Law Team, the report of the

       Investigating Officer, Mr. Graham Brander, of 5th May 2011 (POL00056478)

       summarised the investigation which had taken place. He had analysed the

       Overnight Cash Holdings Data and had concluded that false declarations had
e




       been made in respect of the total value of the 50 notes held in the branch from

       13"' January 2010. This date was prior to the migration of the Rowlands Castle
I      Sub Post Office Branch to Horizon Online, which was given as 5th July 2010.

    46. Jamail Singh of the Criminal Law Team advised in his Memo of 17th June 2011

       (POL00046626) that further information should be obtained. It would appear to

       be the case that Mr. Brander returned the file along with a memo dated 9th

                   2011 (POL00046628).
        December




    47. The statement of Mr. Nigel Allen (POL00057026) confirmed that Mrs. Hutchings

       contract as Postmaster at the Rowlands Castle Sub-Post Office Branch had been

       summarily terminated. He exhibited copies of a number of sections of the

       contract and confirmed that the branch had migrated to Horizon online in July

       2010.

    of                   branch Trading Period, a                                Statement should be printed and

    Louise. Sheridan exhibited a log of the 33 calls to the National Business Support

    Centre between 1St June 2010 and Stn April 2011 (POL00054806) and noted that

    only 2 related to losses or gains. One related to a Co-Op cash deposit accepted

    incorrectly at the branch as an Alliance and Leicester deposit. The other related

    to the branch remitting in stock from a previous trading period. It was noted that

    none of the remaining calls on the log appeared to be in relation to the reporting

   of               cash shortage in the accounts or anything that                           immediately appear to

   indirectly cause a large cash shortage in the accounts.

50. Mr, Andrew Dunks in his statement of 12th                                    2011 (POL00056659) stated that

   Desk (HSD) was a service run by Fujitsu Services for the Post Office and that in

   the event of a Sub-Postmaster or Counter Clerk experiencing a problem
                                                                                                               or

   could be placed to the HSD. He went onto provide details of 4 calls which had

   been                               by the HSD and produced exhibit APD01 (POL40046047). It was

                    logged
   his opinion that none of the calls related to faults which would have affected the

                             of the information held on the system as none of the calls raised
   integrity




    problems that fell outside the normal operating parameters of the Horizon

   System.

51. Mr. David Dixon                            his statement of 22nd September 2011 (POL00057001)
                                          in




   explained how the Post Office                                     a computer                         SapADS

    calculate and forecast the cash requirements for each branch. This analysis

    could result in cash being sent out to a branch or a request for a branch to return

    cash. He was able to identify branches which had returned less cash than

           requested. Mr. Dixon noted that he had requested the return of £30,000 by the

          Rowlands Castle Sub Post Office Branch on 71h March 2011. Only £14,000 was

           returned on 8th March. It would appear that he therefore triggered an audit at the

        branch on 9th March 2011.

52. Mr. Graham Brander prepared a detailed statement on 25th November 2011

      (POL00044535) in which he explained that he had analysed Overnight Cash

         Holding (ONCH) Data going back as far as 27th December 2009. He concluded

        that there appeared to be a pattern in that the total value of the cash being held

        (usually the 50 notes) was being inflated and falsely declared by the
                                                                                                         Rowlands

    Data in the form of Audit Record Queries(ARQs) which he had analysed. He
    exhibited a summary he had produced of Cash Declarations, Variances and

    Declared Discrepancies.

53, On Ott, January 2012 t considered the material in the case file, advised upon it

    and also drafted a            for         alleged offence of fraud (POL00057362). The

    rationale for my decision was that there appeared to be strong evidence which

    rebutted the suggestion put forwards by Mrs.                                     her prepared




                                                                                in

    statement i.e. that she had declared incorrect figures only after the branch had

    migrated. It was evident that the true cash position had been incorrectly declared

    for a much longer period of time and that, at the point of migration, an incorrect

    figure in respect of the unusable notes held in the branch had been declared. I

    felt that the evidence was inconsistent with Mrs. Hutchings' account, undermined

    her credibility and gave weight to the inference that she had been covering her

    tracks. Furthermore, the investigating officer had not suggested that any of the

    difficulties to which Mrs. Hutchings had referred in her interview had any
    relevance.
54. 1 believe that the file which Post Office Ltd had submitted to Cartwright King

    would have been returned to the Criminal Law Team with a copy of my Advice,

    for further consideration to be given as to the merits of a prosecution in

    accordance with any applicable Investigation and Prosecution Policies in place

    at the time and for a charging decision to be                    by Post Office Ltd.

    Justices at Portsmouth Magistrates Court on 14th March 2012 (POL000575'15)

    enclosing copies of the bundle of evidence for the first hearing. It would appear

   that the first hearing of the case took place on 10th April 2012 and that Mr. Robert




   (POL00057607), it would appear that Mrs. Hutchings gave 'no indication' of her

   plea and that her committal date was set for 6th June 2012. 1 appear to have sent

   copies of the committal papers to Mrs. Hutchings' Solicitors on 22nd May 2012

   (POL00057796).



   that Mrs. Hutchings case had been committed to the Crown Court at Portsmouth,

   her solicitor accepting that there was a case to answer. The Plea and Case

   Management Hearing was scheduled to take place on 30th July 2012.

58. It would appear that Will Martin, Counsel of 9-12 Bell Yard, London, was

   instructed to represent Post Office Ltd and from the email which I received from

   Rachel Panter on 30th July 2012 (POL00058142), that he had informed her by

   telephone that a second count of False Accounting had been added to the

   indictment in respect of which Mrs. Hutchings had entered a Guilty Plea.

59_ In Mr. Will Martin's Attendance Note of 30th July 2012 (POL00058132) he made

   reference to the conversation which had taken place with Miss Whittle-Martin,

   Counsel for the Defendant, who had offered a guilty plea to the offence of false

   accounting. Whilst he referred to having had a consultation with `those

    instructing', without sight of the Cartwright King file I am unable to comment

   further.

    upon it. This duty included the disclosure of relevant documents or information

    which might reasonably be considered capable of undermining the case for the

    Prosecution against Mrs. Hutchings or of assisting with her case.

63. 1 am not able to recall whether Mrs. Hutchings served a Defence Statement or

    whether the decision to prosecute or the counts on the Indictment were reviewed

    by myself or anyone else prior to the hearing on 30th July 2012.

The Prosecution of Khayyam Ishag

68. 1 was instructed to advise upon the criminal investigation concerning Mr.

         Khayyam Ishaq. He had been the Sub Postmaster of the Birkinshaw Post Office

             Branch. I have been provided with access to a number of documents which

             include the Investigation Report of 13th May 2011 (POL00046224), Records of

        Taped        Interviews conducted      on            7th April 2011 (POL00046349 and

        (POL00046228) and 5th July 2011 (POL00056600 and P0L00056596). I have

         also seen         Record of Taped Interview of 27th September 2011 (POL00057985),
                       a

             Rob Wilson of I I" October 2011 (POL00046235).

69. It is evident that a case file was submitted by the Security Operations Team to

             the Criminal Law Team at Post Office Ltd prior to it becoming independent of the

             Royal Mail Group. Advice was later sought from Cartwright King and that is when

             I first became involved in the case concerning Mr. Ishaq. I cannot recall any

             `handover' process or briefing' from the Criminal Law Team. I have not had sight

             of the case file held by Cartwright King and due to the passage of time could not

   circumstances in which a full audit of the branch had been conducted on 8th

   February 2011.

71. Mr. Ishaq was interviewed under caution on 7th April 2011 (P0L00046349 and

   POL00045133). During his first interview on that date Mr. Ishaq denied stealing

   any money belonging to Post Office Ltd and also denied inflating his cash on

   hand to cover discrepancies in the accounts. Mr. Ishaq stated that he had not

   contacted the NBSC helpline but had contacted `Chesterfield' in relation to every

   loss which he had incurred in the branch.

72. In Mr. lshaq's second interview on 7th April 2011 Mr. Ishaq was informed that

   °Chesterfield' had had been informed of discrepancies of £1065 and £479 but

   had no record of the discrepancies of £4211 and £3658. Mr Ishaq explained that

   he had problems with his recollection. He had, however, remembered that

   another member of staff had forgotten to count cash to the value of £4000.

   Accordingly, this had not been included but the money had been used to make

   good the loss. Mr. Ishaq also thought the same thing had happened in relation to

   the other loss.

              charge has not been provided) and advised that a number of further statements

         should be obtained.

75. Mr. Ishaq was further interviewed on 27th September 2011 (POL00057985). It

          was put to Mr. Ishaq that his assistant, whom he had previously referred to, had

       stated that he had never been informed of any discrepancies and that he had

              never been told that he had forgotten to count cash. The Investigation Report

    submitted to the Criminal Law Team on 3 1c October 2011 also made reference

       to discrepancies in Mr. Ishaq's account.

76. Mr. Wilson responded to this Investigation Report in a Memo of 11th October

      2011 (POL00046235) and requested that Horizon Data                      be obtained to
       investigate reversals of sales of stamps.

77. On 23rd March 2012 1 considered the evidence, advised upon it and drafted a

      charge for an alleged offence of theft (POL00057543). I noted in my advice that
       Horizon Data for the period 2"d November 2010 to 3131 January 2011 had been

      obtained and that a summary of stock sales and reversals had been prepared. I

   also advised that a number of further statements should be taken.

78. On the basis of the available information, I concluded that there appeared to be

   strong evidence against Mr. Ishaq. There were inconsistencies in his account

    and the witness to whom Mr. Ishaq had referred during the interview process had

    not corroborated his account. I was of the opinion that this undermined Mr.

     Ishaq's credibility and strengthened the                            him. Furthermore, the
                                                        case




                                                               against

    any applicable Investigation and Prosecution Policies in place at the time and for

    a charging decision to be made by Post Office Ltd.
80. It would appear to be the case from my email of 3 May 2012 to Steve Bradshaw

    (POL00119429) that I put together the bundle of case papers for the first hearing

    before the Bradford Magistrates' Court on 30th May 2012.

81, 1 have not been provided with a copy of my Attendance Note of 30th May 2012.

    It is evident, however, from my email of 315t May 2012 (POL00119452) that I

    reported to Steve Bradshaw that Mr. lshaq's Solicitor had informed me his client

    denied any wrongdoing.
82. According to this email Mr. lshaq had given 'no indication' of his plea and the

    Court decided that his case was not suitable for summary trial. The case had

    been adjourned until 25th July 2012 to enable the committal papers to be

    prepared.

83. 1 have not been provided with a copy of my Attendance Note of 25th July 2012.

    However, in my email of 26th July 2012 to Rachel Panter and Andy Cash

    (UKG100001432), I noted that Mr. lshaq's case had been committed to the Crown

    Court at Bradford and the Plea and Case Management Hearing had been

    scheduled for 4th September 2012. 1 also stated in my email that "the Defendant's

    Solicitor made it clear that the functionality of the Horizon System would be an
    issue. The Defendant has instructed them that the correct amount of money will

    be there in the accounts somewhere and that there is an error with Horizon..."

84. 1 went on to say, "This is going to be another of those cases where we will have

   to anticipate and deal with the Horizon issue and consider our approach."

              arguments were to be anticipated. I prepared a Brief for in-house Counsel

              Statement whilst preparing this statement, it would appear from the `Comments

              on lshaq DCS (P0L00059602) prepared by Gareth Jenkins, that Mr. lshaq's

              Solicitors had requested:

    i)        The full file of papers relating to this investigation (as the paginated papers

              served upon the defence to support the prosecution are clearly a small extract of

              the full file of papers relating to this case);

           investigations and/or enquiries and/or reviews (whether investigated by the Post

           office or any other body) into the correct functioning of the Post Office Horizon

           used to produce exhibit SB/21

vii)       An indication of the actual Horizon system data as would have been visible to

           the Defendant showing sales of stamps on dates referred to in Stephen

           Bradshaw's statement (Pages 17 to 21) and subsequent reversals referred to

           therein.

           Bradshaw and Sarah Porter, in-house Counsel at Cartwright King on 3 '

           September 2012 {'POL00046242). I commented that the Defence were clearly

           aware of the current Horizon issues i.e. the allegations being made to the effect

           that the system was not reliable. 1 also made reference to 'a fishing expedition'

           as I considered some of the requests in the Defence Statement to be too wide or

           for information which was either not disclosable or riot relevant.

        89.1 forwarded a copy of Sarah Porters' Attendance Note of 4t' September 2012 to



           (P0L00046243). In her Attendance Note, which I had set out below my email,

           Miss Porter reported that she had, "made it clear that our stance is that Horizon

94. On 7th January 2013 Rachel Panter sent an email to Mr. Jenkins (FUJ00153919)

    asking that he prepare a report in relation to this case. She attached a copy of

    the Defence Statement, Summary of Facts and the Indictment. She explained in

    her email that the Defence were asserting that Mr. lshaq was not dishonest                                                         he
    had to make reversals in order to balance as there had been a malfunction of the

   system.

95.11 is evident from my email to Steve Bradshaw of 15°' January 2013

   (POL00127677) that I had received a letter from Mr. lshaq's Solicitor and that I
   had attached a copy to the email. I asked Mr. Bradshaw to forward copies of the

   interview tapes and indicated that we would discuss the other points raised.

   Without sight of the Cartwright King file, I am unable to comment further.

   Mr. Ishaq could provide                       detailed information, it would enable a directed and

   them. He also commented that"...the system doesn't malfunction without leaving

   some trail to indicate what has happened. Without examining the logs it is difficult

   to be any more specific." He went on to state that he thought there were three

   possibilities. Firstly, the Defendant might not have understood the way the

   system operated and that difficulties in reconciliation had been due to his lack of

   understanding. Secondly, the Defendant had stolen the money and thirdly, there

   was a fault with the system. He went on to state that "There is no evidence of a

   fault in the system (and the fact that the system operates without issue in 12,000

   other branches supports this fact)...'

99.1 received an email on Vt February 2013 (POL00119432) from Mr. Ishaq's

   solicitors which enclosed a letter. I have not been provided with access to a copy

   of that letter. I note, however, that the email referred to an imminent hearing of

   the case for Mention and that I forwarded a copy of the letter by email to Steve

   Bradshaw and Mark Ford of Counsel on 4th February 2013 (POL00119431).

100. On 4th February 2013 1 prepared a Notice of Additional Evidence and sent a

   copy to Mark Ford of Counsel (UKGI00018011). The documents enclosed with

   the Notice included copies of statements of Stephen Bradshaw of 27th January

   2013 and 31st January 2013.

101. In his statement of 27th January 2013 (POL00046264) Mr. Bradshaw provided

    Steve Bradshaw prior to the hearing which took place before the Grown Court at

    Bradford on 5th February 2013. 1 was informed that there was no material for

    disclosure to the Defence. I relayed this to Counsel who in turn informed the

    Court of the position.

104. In my email of 6th February 2013 to Steve Bradshaw and Mark Ford

    (POL00059652) I referred to the Mention Hearing the previous day. Mr. Ford

    had confirmed that there was no further material to be disclosed and Mr. lshaq's

    case remained listed for trial on Monday 25th February 2013. 1 reported that the

    Defence had been unable to persuade the Judge to order any further disclosure.

    I had not regarded the spreadsheet which had been put together within the

   Security Team of previous unfounded allegations to be disclosable.

105. Mr. Bradshaw provided a statement on 11th February 2013 (POL00059686) in

   which he explained that "Post Office Ltd continued to have absolute confidence

   in the robustness and integrity of its Horizon system and its branch accounting

   processes." At the time it was consistent with my understanding of the position,

   the observations and comments being made by Mr. Bradshaw, the instructions
   provided by Jarnail Singh and it was also the stated position of Post Office Ltd,

   which I understood to have been confirmed by General Counsel Susan Crichton_

106. It is my recollection that Mr. Bradshaw would positively assert that the Horizon

   system was reliable. He described it as a 'posh calculator' and that if, for

   example, stamps were sold, the number of stamps in stock would decrease by

   the number sold and the amount of cash required to balance would increase by

   the value of the stamps sold.

107_ An Addendum Defence Statement dated 20th February 2013 (POL00046278)

   was received by Cartwright King and forwarded to both Gareth Jenkins and

   Steven Bradshaw for their consideration. I do not recall receiving any comment

   in relation to the Addendum Defence Statement from Mr. Bradshaw until the day

   of trial i.e_ Monday 25th February 2013.

108. Mr. Jenkins added a number of comments to a copy of the Addendum Defence

   Statement (P0[00059874) during the afternoon of Friday 22''t February 2013.

109.1n response to the suggestion made by Mr lshaq that the Horizon Online

   system would crash and freeze and would give inaccurate total figures at the end

   of trading and/or balance periods, Mr. Jenkins commented that he was aware

   that, "there were some issues in the early days of Horizon Online. However I

   don't believe that these impacted the overall accounting at the end of the periods

   provided recovery was carried out correctly. The migration date (10th July 2010)

   for the Birkinshaw Branch was well into the full rollout and the Branch was not
   operating Horizon Online during the pilot between January and June."

110. l attended the Grown Court at Bradford on Monday 25th February 2013. It is my

   recollection that Mr Bradshaw commented to the effect that he had spent a

   significant amount of time towards the end of the previous week working through

   the Addendum Defence Statement and the calls referred to. He informed me that

   he had not discovered anything which could assist the Defence.

111.It is also my recollection that Mr.                                              commented to the effect that the




                                                  Jenkins
   make me aware of the existence of any other bugs.

112. I did not regard the comments made by Mr. Jenkins in respect of Mr. Ishaq's

                  that the Horizon Online system would crash and freeze as
   suggestion




   inconsistent with his statement of 15th                                              2013 (FUJ00124229). It

                                                                                                                           was
   apparent that this was not an issue that fell outside the operating parameters of

   the Horizon system given Mr. Jenkins' belief that accounting                                                   not have been




                                                                                                          would
   affected provided that the recovery measures built into the system had been

   carried out correctly. Accordingly, I did not regard Mr. Jenkins' comments as
   disclosable.

113. At the request of Mark Ford I forwarded two emails to Mr. Jenkins

   (FUJ00156747 and FUJ00154002) attaching the Defence Report and the

   Opening Note in order that Mr. Jenkins could work through them.

114. I understand that Mr.                                            a                                             on Defence

                                                                          document

   Expert's Report" (FUJOO124337) and that he was subsequently involved in the

       preparation of a Joint Statement of Beverley Ibbotson and Gareth Jenkins

   (POL00059927).

115. I do not recall being present at Court on 26th February 2012 although is evident

   from the Report of Mr Bradshaw (POL00046249) that Counsel for the Defence

      became ill on 26th February 2013 and so the case was adjourned until 6th March

   2013. It would appear that Mr. Ishaq pleaded guilty to theft on 7th March 2013.

116. Without sight of the Cartwright King file I am unable to comment on the

    circumstances which resulted in the production of Mr. Jenkins statement of 6th

117. Mr. lshaq was sentenced to a term of imprisonment on Monday 22°d April 2013.

    Simon Clarke of Cartwright King appeared for the Prosecution on that occasion,

       Mr. Ford having been unable        attend.




                                     to
118. 1 have seen a copy of Mr. Ford's email of the same date (POL00060315) in

     which he asked about the outcome and my response which contained the

         phrase, "OIC etc very happy...". The message which I had intended to convey

   was that an unnecessary adjournment had been avoided by Mr Clarke being able

     to stand in at the last minute for Mr Ford and that, so far as Post Office Ltd was

      concerned, an appropriate sentence had been imposed.

119. Without sight of the file held by Cartwright King I cannot say whether the

       prosecution or the counts on the indictment were reviewed.

120. Upon reading a draft copy of the Second Sight Interim Report I became aware

    of the existence of bugs which had affected Horizon Online. I brought Mr_ lshaq's

   case to the attention of Simon Clarke. I had been unaware of the existence of

   the bugs referred to and these would clearly have been disclosable in Mr. lshaq's

    case. I also brought to the attention of Simon Clarke another statement which

   Mr. Jenkins had made to the effect that there were sophisticated bug detection

   systems and that several years previously there had been a bug in the previous

   version of the Horizon system which had affected a single branch.

121.1 have read the Judgement of the Court of Appeal in Josephine Hamilton and

   Others -v- Post Office Limited (2021) EWCA Grim 577 (POLOO113278) and in

    particular paragraphs 214 to 220.

122. It is evident that the investigation of Mr. lshaq and the subsequent prosecution

      had proceeded on the basis that the data generated by the Horizon system was

                I had not been made aware that the Horizon data was not reliable.
   reliable.

123.1 was very concerned to read that there had been in the region of 30 bugs,

   errors and defects in the Horizon System and its successor, Horizon Online. It is

   highly likely that this information would have affected my advice and at the very

   least, have prompted me to ask further questions or that further investigations be

   carried out.

124. I find it distressing that Mr. Ishaq served a                     of imprisonment and                       wish

126.1 have been asked to consider the email chain (POL00124770) and to explain

   what I understood Rachel Panter to be discussing when she referred                            to
                                                                                                              'amnesty

    articles' in her email of 19th February 2013. 1 have no recollection of this

    conversation and so am unable to comment further.
127. I have been asked to consider the email which I received from Jarnail Singh of
    10th December 2012 (P0L00141478) and explain whether it was common, in my

        experience, for the Post Office to refer to the business or public interest'. I do

        not recall the case to which this email relates. I note from the first sentence,
        however, that John Scott appeared to have agreed with Counsel's advice that it

    was neither in the business interest or public interest to proceed with the
        prosecution.

128.1 have been asked to consider the email chain (POL00145149). I note that it

   was first sent to Simon Clarke and myself during the evening of 3rd July 2013 and

   referred to a conference which had taken place earlier that day. This conference

   had taken place at the offices of Post Office Ltd in London and a draft copy of

   the Second Sight Interim Report had been discussed. I took notes of the advice

   provided by Simon Clarke at the meeting but have not been provided with access
   to them.
129. it would appear from the email chain that during the conference, Simon Clarke

   advised regarding the disclosure of information relating to the B14 bug_ It is also

   evident from the email chain that, on 4th July 2013, Simon Clarke indicated he

   would further consider the position once he had seen the information which we

   expected to be forwarded to myself. Due to the passage of time, I am unable to

            the nature of the information which we had expected to receive or, indeed,
   recall




   whether we received it. If I did provide any advice, I anticipate that it would have

   been provided only after I had first discussed the position with Simon Clarke.

130. `It was during the meeting on 3r" July 2013 that Simon Clarke advised Post

   Office Ltd        hold a weekly conference call so as to establish a single central hub
                to




    into which all information relating to defects and bugs within the Horizon system

   should be reported, thereby creating a single source of information which could

   be reviewed for disclosure purposes.

131. During the first weekly conference call it was explained that although a central

                                                                                 W ITN09680100




   actions would be likely to be well intentioned, there was a substantial risk that

   inaccurate information could be generated 'and without the visibility of the

   conference call, further disseminated to others. He was concerned that this, in

   itself, would be unhelpful and be likely to lead to information, whether accurate

   or otherwise, being retained within departments and not fed back to the weekly

   calla
132. I considered the position in terms of the disclosure obligations placed on Post

   Office Ltd as a prosecutor. Simon Clarke had advised Post Office Ltd to create a

   single hub to record all Horizon-related information. An approach which

   increased the risk that inaccurate information could be collated or which could

   result in information being retained within departments without being fed back to

   the conference call was undesirable. It was therefore essential in my view that,

   as Simon Clarke had advised, a single central record should be established and

   maintained with a view to making any disclosure exercise as straightforward as

   possible.

133. Although I have not been provided with access to my notes and records, I
   believe that it became apparent during the third weekly conference call that Post

   Office Ltd was contemplating a change of approach. I was concerned that Post

   Office Ltd would be in breach of its duty to record and retain information and I

   pointed out during the call that a central record had to be kept.

134. I believe that it was around this time that I was informed by Jarnail Singh that

   John Scott had voiced an intention to `shred' the minutes which had been

   prepared of the weekly conference calls. Jarnail Singh also informed me of his

   concern that Post Office Ltd might suggest that Cartwright King had advised this

   course of action. I brought this to the attention of Simon Clarke whilst also voicing
