Managing Director’s Summary

PROGRAMME PROGRESS

* National Rollout week 3 started on 6th September with 45 outlets forecast
to be installed in the week. It has also been agreed with POCL, that week
4 will proceed with 82 outlets forecast for the week commencing 13th
September.

On 10th September a National Rollout Checkstep Review will take place
with POCL to confirm if National Rollout will continue with week 5 and
week 6. If it does continue, the agreements reached last week with POCL
to schedule the final two weeks of National Rollout for 1999 and to re-
schedule week-2 will lead to a forecast of 2481 outlets being installed in
1999 with the 1800 required for the first National Rollout payment part
being reached:in the weck ending 7th November.

° Progress on the above is.dependant not only on the 10th September
Checkstep but Acceptance being achieved by 24th September. Until that
point, additional outlets installed are an extension to Live Trial and at
ICL's risk.

° Atthe end of August, 17,252 Outlets have been entered into the
programme via receipt of an RGM letter. 14,457 have been surveyed and
7,453 had finished modification and preparation and were ready for
installation. An additional outlet (Borough High Street) was implemented
in August following a fire.

* Live Trial has continued with improved stability Acceptance Incident-298
and continued improvement in cash account activities on a Wednesday
Acceptance Incident 218 and the performance of the Helpdesk continues
to improve Acceptance Incident 408.

* Development of future releases continue with SIP16 (Multiple Cash
Accounts.and Reference Data Type B changes) on schedule:and
undergoing Main Pass System Testing. CSR+ is currently broadly on
schedule but-is being impacted by current activities on Al's. Work
contained in the Acceptance Incident [Al] rectification plans will put
further pressure onthe release and resourcing required to overcome this
issue is récéiving urgent management attention.

THE SUPPLEMENTARY AGREEMENT

* Acceptance was not achieved at the Joint Acceptance Board on 18th
August due to POCL's views that 3 Acceptance Incidents remained at High
severity, and a further 6 at Medium severity did not have agreed
rectification plans.

* Rather than repeat a full second Acceptance Test as provided for in the
Codified Contract, it was agreed to deal solely with the outstanding
incidents, and any substantive faults which might also arise. The key
elements of the Supplementary Agreement are:

°

A Limited Trial Period will take place until 17th September during which a
programme of joint workshops will seek to produce resolution plans for all
outstanding Al's and to create a single timetable for these plans.

The Expert will act as a facilitator and adviser to both parties to achieve a
successful resolution of outstanding issues.

° POCL do have the right to raise other Substantive New Faults during this
period under tight conditions with respect to timescales and use of the
Expert. They warrant that they are not aware of any Substantive New
Faults as at 20 August.

There will be a pre-meeting of both the Joint Acceptance Board (JAB) and
the Release Authorisation Board (RAB) on 21 September at which the

a appropriateness of proceeding: with the planned-Acceptance date-of 24~-+ =———— ~

September will be discussed.

° The JAB will meet on 24 September and will be followed immediately by
the RAB.

The timetable specified above.has been followed by both parties.

Although progress has been made on each and every Acceptance Incident,

POCL.has not yet downgraded the High severity ones to Medium, nor

have they accepted our Rectification plans. They have raised two new

medium incidents under. the Substantive Faults. arrangements, which also
- must have agreed rectification plans.

An overall assessment of the likely outcome on Acceptance has been
conducted and the scenarios studied are outlined below. The ‘most likely'
scenario maintains that Acceptance will be secured on 24 September
notwithstanding the amount of work outstanding and the lack of any
further schedule contingency. All ICL Pathway management is focused on
managing the risks in this plan.

The financial implications of these scenarios are covered in the report
from the Commercial and Finance Director.

Development Report

MONTHLY SUMMARY

The development téam continues to divide its time between clearing
acceptance incidents that have arisen during the live trial and completing
the development of CSR+.

The POCL Infrastructure team, which is responsible for EPOSS, has had a
particularly difficult month as pressure mounted to gain ‘Acceptance’.

The Technical Integration and Business & Technical Conformance Teams
have been busy building the hardware rigs necessary to support the testing
schedule and completing the detailed test plans and scripting work.

The SIP16 release, which comprises of enhancements to the cash account
and reference data elements, is still on schedule and expected to be
operational late October.

The NUMA interception activities are on schedule and no major issues
have been identified to date.

Although the development and testing of CSR+ is going well, the level of
change is becoming a source of concern and needs to be very carefully
managed.

PROGRESS

The APS counters and host deliveries continue to be made on or about the
planned dates and system testing progress is in line with expectations. The
status of the SPM programme between Horizon, POCL and British Gas
trading is a source of concern. Meetings are being arranged between the
parties but Direct Interface Testing is now at risk.

LFS development is now complete. Early link testing has uncovered a few
minor problems but no significant issues have yet arisen. All CARs have
now either been agreed or CCNs are with POCL for sign-off. There are a
few concerns surrounding the readiness of POCL (SAPADS) to enter
interface testing in October and Horizon have agreed to clarify the
situation.

° The POCL Infrastructure team (EPOSS, Reference Data, TPS) is
experiencing difficulties maintaining the CSR+ schedule due to the
demands being placed on them to support ‘acceptance’. The plans are now
being reviewed in detail to determine what actions are required.

Good progress is being maintained with Autoconfiguration, FTMS and
Audit even though CSR support is greater than expected.

The second delivery from the KMS team has been achieved and progress
on VPN isin accordance with the plan.

° The final delivery of the enhancements to the Data Warehouse has been
received but system testing is running slightly behind schedule. The team is
considering recovery options. Work on the Internal Infrastructure (RoDB,
Estate Management-OCMS) has been replanned to recover earlier slippage
bur there is now no contingency.

* We are making good progress with the detailed test plans and script
production in B&TC

COST DOWN

°

There were no new initiatives in August. In fact, the impact of gaining
acceptance and the emergence of several change proposals is putting the
manpower resource plans under considerable pressure.

CURRENT CRITICAL PROBLEMS

As anticipated last month, the problems experienced by the live trial
outlets with the Epson back office printer ‘hanging’ during the production
of the weekly cash account became a serious acceptance incident which is
proving extremely difficult to resolve.

actoring in the additional development work, which has arisen from the
acceptance workshops into the current delivery plans, is a formidable
challenge.

ISSUES

The plan for introducing the functionality in CSR+ involved a series of
increments to the live system controlled via the normal service
management and release authorisation processes. This approach was
preferred to reduce this risk of destabilising the system. POCL had not
thought this through and are uneasy with the implications on their
interface testing. We must work hard to agree a joined up plan.

The KMS product currently limits che outlet distribution population to
circa 600 per week. This places an unacceptable constraint on the
implementation of CSR+, consequently design reviews are being held to
resolve the issuc.

BT and Energis have indicated that there will be approximately 85 - 100
outlets with no land network connections possible. They are suggesting
that we should consider a satellite solution and this is being evaluated.

We have not yet been able to find an acceptable working solution for the
lighoweight mobile configurations i.c. those required to be carried and
operated in a variety of remote locations every day, approximately 250 of
this type have been identified.

The new contract states that we must ‘remove’ not simply ‘disable’ the BPS
code. There are a few components where this could present a risk e.g.
multi-functioning agents and shared counter elements. This is being looked
at in detail and could generate additional work not currently planned.

Thére are concerns-regarding the performance of -OBCS foreign
transactions. Although there are several options for resolving this issue,
none of the work required is in the plans.

POCL expect under the terms of the new agreement i.e. time and
materials, to closely monitor our resource consumption during the design
and development of any new product or service. Their expectations could
put-a-huge burden on the administration resources within our Programme
office.

COSTS

The 1999/2000 forecasts. demonstrate that costs are under tight control
and subject to regular financial reviews throughout the year.

MONTHLY SUMMARY

° Once again the team has been fully committed to the Acceptance activity. At

the time of this report we are in the second phase of Acceptance and have
reduced the.Hot List to eight, two of which POCL are judging as High.

DETAILED PLAN ACTIVITIES

ACCEPTANCE INCIDENTS

Under the terms of the supplemental agreement, POCL were entitled to
raise further Acceptance Incidents as “substantive faults” at Medium up to
3/9. In fact they raised only two - 412 and, in outline only, 413.

* Resolved Als:

° 413: This concerned criticism of the allocation of system incidents to
Problem Categories within Al 298, POCL provided no evidential material
and eventually POCL withdrew the incident unconditionally.

° 314: Tony H produced further versions of the document specification for
the APIs for OPS and TMS and POCL has accepted that Pathway will
produce any changes to TMS Agents.

* 372: Dave H, with excellent support from Glen Stephens, found
resolutions for all issues.

° 391: Dave J has progressively reduced all the issues and negotiated their
clearance with Alliance & Leicester.

° The resolution of disagreements on the severity of those incidents that
POCL deemed as Low but Pathway deemed as None has started. There are
39 to beaddressed. A significant number will be resolved by Closure, as
actions that were in progress at the time of the disagreement have since been
completed. This activity has to be completed by 21 September.

* Open Als:

° There are now two Als that are still officially deemed by POCL as High:

°

298: The push to clear the most important Of-the outstanding system
incidents has continued. Although there is constant disagreement about the
treatment of the.figures, a consistent set to week 24 shows steady
improvement:

376: The various root causes of the transaction stream to TIP not

additional set of reconciliation controls agreed for introduction by the
end of the year. There are still problems in getting POCL

The remainder six Als are all assessed by POCL as Medium:

218: This concerned, nominally, the Managers’ Training and the
complexity of Cash Account operations. It was reduced to Medium on
9/9. \t has a dependency on ...

408: This related to meeting Help Desk SLAs. The successful
introduction from 7-8/9 of the special Help Desk Cash Account domain
to handle the peak of Cash Account calls is the final holding factor on
this one.

369: This concerns the bar-code reading performance. It has been
demonstrated that users treating non-bar-coded books as bar-coded
books cause over half of the problems. Special bar-code evaluation
equipment has been sourced and is in use from today to assess cases
where the printed bar-code itself is suspect.

378: This Al covers cases where not all transactions are brought to
account in the outlet Cash Account. The remaining action is a design
review of measures to prevent repeated touches/keystrokes affecting Cash
Account operations.

211: Receipts and Payments not equal in the double entry. Although
this AI was cleared there has been some regression and not all of the new
incidents are yet fixed.

412: This concerns timely provision of ad hoc reports. A POCL request
for a report of actual transaction times was apparently lost and in any
event cannot be supplied at present.

CURRENT CRITICAL PROBLEMS

Acceptance continues as the sole critical activity.

MONTHLY SUMMARY

The speed of turnaround required for acceptance incidents is straining the
Release Management processes to the limit, however the software
distribution mechanism continues to operate well with distributions
successfully committing to approximately 780 (out of 820) counters on the
first pass.

High ISDN Charges are a serious problem needing urgent resolution. Daily
reports now being produced by Energis show some Post Offices incurring
charges greater than £5 per day. Realistically, the charge should be in the
region £1.50 per day (£45 per month).

Performance of Correspondence Servers has been poor. with over 20
separate failures. All failures have been addressed, with the exception of
blue screening (which is still under investigation) and all Servers are now
running normally.

All SLAs were met in August with the exception of APS day B and Day D,
which fell below Minimum Acceptable Level.

OSD have made some strategic proposals with regard to service
improvement. Unless there is significant improvement in their management
of the service, Pathway will terminate the current contracts and are actively

looking at how this could be accomplished with minimum risk and

disruption.

Excellent progress has been made on Business Continuity testing. Although
there is still much work.to do, there-are no outstanding acceptance incidents.

Release management has been extremely active, with OTT, in the: release of
fixes to the live service in support.of acceptance. Performance from SMC
software distribution been good.

There are concerns with regard to the challenging timescales of the AP Client
migration plan. These will be reviewed with POCL.

SUPPORT SERVICES

Throughout August, high volumes of calls were received and additional tasks
undertaken to support the resolution of Acceptance Incidents.

Following Correspondence Server problems at the end of July the transactions
from 59 Outlets failed to get harvested. All these transactions have now been
delivered.

Plans have been outlined by OSD to improve the Systems Operate and
HSH/SMC services that they provide but performance from SMC remains an
isstic.

There is concern over the provision of out-of-hours support for APS within
A&TC. The arrangements are being reviewed.

Several OBCS barcode-scanning exercises have been successfully carried out in
relation to Acceptance Incident 369.

A supplementary response to Al408 (Horizon System Helpdesk) was the subject

The MIS team has been stretched this past month due to AI298 requiring HSH
call analysis. Extraction of the relevant PowerHelp detail has now been
‘automated’. There is concern that we may not be looking at HSH calls in the*’
sdme-way as POCL who seem to identify every system fault as being included
within AI 298. Agreement with POCL is needed as a matter of urgency.

Reconciliation incidents are being turned around in the required timescales, ~
although the volume still remains higher than expected due to changes made to
the incident management process between Pathway and POCL.

Cash Account related reconciliation incidents continue to fall as the LT2
software is refined. The main area of concern is still centred on the performance
of the printing process with a high number of calls being received by the HSH.

Incident management procedures have been revised and agreed with POCL. All
TP related incidents, with the exception of file delivery problems, are now being
raised as reconciliation calls via the HSH with regular updates provided to TP
via the RED process.

SEM monitoring is continuing. A process is being prepared to allow the
improvement / refining of event filtering.

A CP is being drafted to improve the provision of Security Event
Management and SecurID administration services from one client.

The back-up strategy on the Pathway Development Server is being reviewed
as numerous Performance related files have gone missing from there.

has been set up to co-ordinate testing and implementing the plans.
AUDIT

° Internal audits:

* tmplementation Audit; report has been issued to Implementation for
comment. It raised a number of issues, including staff.dependencies, lack
of system contingency and little process documentation.

* Change Management. CAP dates have been agreed and distributed for
action. Will be reviewed in September.

* Audit Data Use. SSC require access to data over 35 days. The only source of
this is the audit DLTs. A legal opinion of ownership of audit data is being
sought before we expose this to POCL.

YEAR 2000 CONFORMANCE

The Y2k Business Continuity PID has been updated and issued for comment.

° The first OSD Audit of the desktops for WP2K identified 112 “products” in
use within Pathway which were not part of the WP2K baseline. This is a mix
of utility software, web access software, development tools, products
forming part of the operational systems, and business applications.
Compliance statements are now on file for all the significant products.

Whilst-RODB has been tested for compliance there remain concerns
regarding the end to end assurance of the hardware configuration systems
(RODB, ACDB, Brain Builders, etc.). Y2K testing is forecast to complete mid
September.

Implementation rely upon a number of systems including RODB, ROHD
and Activity Tracking Data Base. The latter is specified to use non compliant
product versions and there are doubts as to the rigour of testing. cn fod

Two sessions were held with FJ regarding Y2K;-the first looked specifically
at NT4 SP3 compliance, the second was more broadly based and covered the
full scope including residual work to be done on Continuity Planning. No
issues have been raised. -

CURRENT CRITICAL PROBLEMS

None

ISSUES

* POCL still expect ICL Pathway to provide Witness Statements, Expert

Business Development Report

SUMMARY

The date and scope of the:first Service Development workshop has been
agreed with the Post Office Network unit (PONU). This will be the first
formal step in agreeing future work packages over and above the base
contract. While PONU have agreed a date, they will not attend until we
have received acceptance.

Post Office Network are planning to re-launch Horizon: Again, this will only
happen post-Acceptance. We are involved on the periphery and they may
ask me to speak at the event.

Communications is supporting the achievement of the key milestones of
Acceptance and National roll-out

PROGRESS

BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT:

DVLA: Meeting has been held with ICL Government to discuss re-tender of
IT/IS contract currently held by EDS. We have exchanged knowledge with
Post Office account team, and have confirmed that the DVLA PO counter
contract will be merged with the IT/IS contract for re-tender. New contract
could be worth up to £900m (£70m to 90m p.a. for 7 to 10 years). On that
basis we need to approach PO (not through Pathway links) to establish
whether a joint ICL/PO bid is a winning proposal.

Post Office agreement received to ICL Pathway section of ICL’s ITT
response to National Savings/Siemens Business Systems. Full ICL: response
submitted through HPS.

Discussions have continued with Camelot to promote the use-of the Pathway
infrastructure as part of the next Camelot bid, especially in the light of Post
Office joining the Camelot consortium, We.will be kept informed of
progress by Bob King, ICL’s representative in Camelot.

The National Audit Office (NAO) attended a session in the marketing suite
to investigate the history of the project, and in particular the history of
activities around the payment of multiple benefits. The session ran smoothly
and our input was well received.

As part of our commitment to the Pathway offices outside of Feltham, a
series of presentations were held in the Kidsgrove office to brief staff on the
project, the company, and the key messages going forward. This included a
demonstration of the counter services. These sessions were well received.

* Joint preparation work for the first post-acceptance Service Development

workshop is underway with Post Office Network unit (PONU). An agenda
is expected w/b 20 September. This workshop will allow PONU to explain
where they are looking to take the Horizon service in the future, and will
allow us to explain how we can help them achieve their goals. It will be the
first formal step in agreeing future work packages over and above the base
contract.

As part of Network Banking, Post Office is looking to increase their estate of
ATMs from 158 to 3,000. Pathway gained PONB agreement to a meeting
with ICL Financial Services to investigate what.ICL FS could bring to the
opportunity. PONB are looking to offer a number of ATM ‘concessions’ to
major banks whereby each bank would get a region where it would be their
responsibility to provide and operate PO branded ATMs. Key opportunities
for ICL FS would appear to be; (i.) project managing the configuration and
installation of all ATMs nationwide, and (ii.) providing ATMs to Bank of
Scotland who will be competing for one of the PONB ATM concessions.
The ATM activities are not linked_to the counter opportunity.

A demonstration was provided to the Post Office Group IT architects as part
of an ICL Pathway briefing session.

MARKETING COMMUNICATIONS:

INTERNAL COMMUNICATIONS IN ICL PATHWAY

* Acceptance communication continues to take priority

° 5 more internal demo days have been successfully held - Kid 01 & FEL 01

° Next Brief Encounters will be distributed in early September
EXTERNAL COMMUNICATION

* Plan for NRO communication completed — even though activities now
delayed following the introduction of a new Acceptance phase. Covering
MPs, Media, Analysts & internal comms. Still unable to engage the Post
Office.

* ‘Tim Cobb from NFSP briefed so that he can communicate news important
to us without ICL Pathway being seen to write articles

* MRM’s final fee negotiated down - £4000 saving achieved

* Contracts terminate this month with McCann’s and Financial Dynamics.
POCL COMMUNICATIONS.

POCL review meetings on-going — pleasant but fruitless, although we are
involved in their Horizon relaunch activities

FUJITSU TEAM:

Greg Couper continues to act as [CL Pathway interface to the Fujitsu team.
This role is working well and is valued by all parties.

INTERNATIONAL:

Deutsche Post have now signalled their agreement to our proposal for a
number of consultancy work packages. The first of these will kick offin
September. The maximum value of this first set of work packages is c.
£200K. There will be a call-off against the contract. ICL Germany will help
with providing resource to help with translation.

The Namibian contract continues as planned. Namibian Post have expressed

their satisfaction with progress. The main issue at present is ensuring that

ICL Namibia and Namibian Post are positioned to carry on support and

future development after the ICL Pathway resources finish. :

CTT Portugal has expressed a wish to visit the UK and learn more about our
project. This feels like a ‘let's learn about the pitfalls before we hit them'
session. Whether this results in business for ICL Pathway is not clear at this Pet
time.

Escher are visiting Singapore and Hong Kong week beginning 6 September. it
Fujitsu Hong Kong are involved. It appears that FJ Singapore have lost
interest in Singapore Post. I am investigating this.

Implementation Report

MONTHLY SUMMARY

All Implementation programme milestones were achieved during the
reporting period and the project remains in a satisfactory state of readiness
to start National Rollout. Completion of the installation at Borough High
Street has proven ICL Pathways ALPs installation and migration procedures.

Preparations for National Rollout are progressing well, however some
outlets within the installation phase of the programme have been
subsequently identified as non ISDN sites by BT, very late in the programme.

Concern with Workplace Technologies’ ability to achieve RFI to a realistic
standard and their capacity for completion of outlets within agreed
timescales continues to receive direct and constant action from many
members of the Implementation and commercial teams. WT are continuing
with the Pathway plan of corrective and preventative actions, but still
require constant monitoring. Their commitment to-audit and correct all of
the first 1800 outlets in the programme continues to be monitored closely.

PROGRESS

Recruitment against the agreed Implementation headcount profile remains
on track. Overall ream size will reach 104 during September this year out of
a budgeted 105. The one member of staff to’ be recruited is at KIDO1.

The infrastructure programme, preparing outlets for installation, continues
cto make good progress and from this point in the programme onwards the
infrastructure programme will source outlets from the suspensions list. A
release from POCL of offices previously suspended prior to entry to the
programme, has been made, boosting the “stock” of infrastructure ourlets.
Further releases of outlets from both pre introduction to programme, and
in-programme suspends, are being progressed with POCL.

National Rollout which commenced on 6th September reindins the highest
priority for Implementation at this time with particular focus on ensuring
the programme milestone to install 1800 outlets in early November is
achieved . Contingency plans continue to be prepared and applied to
minimise aborted installation activity through on-the-day rectification
activity using the “man in the van” solution, successfully employed on
previous installation phases... Readiness also includes the availability of a
workable solution for outlets where the standard Horizon desktop solution
is unsuitable. For a large majority of outlets in this category, a trolley
solution has been designed. Progress on the crolley solution has progressed
with POCL, seeing the final specifications moving towards commitment to
CCD status.

* Borough High Street PO was successfully installed on the 27th August. This
ALPS outlet was installed ahead of schedule at the request of POCL, and
successfully proved the installation and migration processes for ALPS outlets.

° POCL have now released the first 14 weeks of outlets into the installation.
This provides the first “full cut” of installation outlets (14 weeks). The first
week of installs commence3d this week with 47 outlets forecast. Installations
continue next week with 80 outlets scheduled for installation.

Training preparation has continue to progress well with all mainstream

courses for managers, assistants and HFSOs having been approved.
Improvements to these courses have included agreed revisions to training
workbooks and Quick Reference Guides which have now been rolled out

CURRENT CRITICAL PROBLEMS

° There is only one area of critical concern and this persists from last month.
It relates to the number.of sites reported by Workplace Technology (WT) as
“Ready For Installation” which niay still be incomplete despite their
reported status.

WT continued, throughout August, to make progress against the action plan a
imposed on them by Pathway in June, however progress was still slow. WF-
have been requested to focus their efforts on the first 1800 NRO sites
without loosing impetus on the future outlets, Further refinement and steps
are being applied to the action plan to ensure that the 1800 are not
threatened.

ISSUES

POCL’s release of suspended outlets into the Infrastructure programme has
eased pressure on the scheduling for the infrastructure phase however there
is still a need to continue this release in both introductions to infrastructure,
and.outlets in process.

The Rollout database still has a number of software bugs in the.current live
version 2.5. However actions are still outstanding to clarify status and
ownership of all issues. The Implementation team has dedicated a resource
full time to the management of RODB delivery to the team, however with a
large amount of issues outstanding and the immanent implementation of the
Secure Managed Environment considerable work is.still required to ensure
RODB success.

COSTS

The level of outstanding calls with the Rollout hélp desk has received
considerable attention to reduce the volume. The Field management team
has been executing an action plan to reduce the level of unresolved calls
prior to the commencement of National Rollout. The activity will continue
during the commencement national rollout activity.

The four regional teams have now completed their office moves to ICL sites,
including the IP2 field team working from the ICL office in Kidsgrove.

Progress to a completion of the trolley solution as described earlier in this
report is important to achieve.

Ongoing issues surrounding the Kidsgrove Powerhelp system may result in
the commencement of NRO without Powerhelp at Kidsgrove. Installation
suppliers are being targeted as priority, but further work is required from
OSD to enable Implementation to be fully equipped.

A solution to the-single counter non-ISDN offices is still awaited. The
solution has been awaited for some time and will need resolution as we
encounter such-offices in-the-programme. ~ —- — - me —_— -

Negotiations continue with Knowledgepool regarding the true impact of
version 12 of the rollout schedule. It is anticipated that this should be
concluded during October.

A baseline budget-was:submitted forapproval at che last financial review.

There were 8 new starters, the majority of whom joined the Implementation
team.

Implementation is now almost fully upto headcount. Two key roles were
filled in the month (an Implementation Programme Executive and a
Training Liaison Manager. There are currently 8 outstanding requirements
as follows: 3x PCO’s, 3x Help desk Analysts, a Technical Manager (on hold)
and a Finance Graduate. The Help Desk Analyst positions are resourced by
temporary staff who will be shortly interviewed for permanent positions.

All managers have been briefed in respect of Y2K working arrangements.
This is a follow up to a briefing earlier in the year. Managers will now
confirm who will definitely be needed to work and also to be on call over
the period.

Objectives for the Professional Variable Pay scheme are still.rather slow in
being returned. Managers and employees will continue to be pressed to
return the agreed objectives as soon as is possible.

40 freelance staff-will transfer over from Enterprise Systems-with-effect- from
3/9/99 and the appropriate arrangements have been made to facilitate chis
transfer.

The cabling work in D block will shortly be completed and the space will be
occupied by ICL Pathway in early September as part of the rationalisation of
our space requirements in FELO1.

MONTHLY SUMMARY
° As anticipated, the weaknesses in [CL’s CRM position precluded achieving
shortlist for SPICE.

MODERN GOVERNMENT

* Cabinet Office has published its action plan for implementation of the
Modernising Govt White Paper; and CITU has published its Gove Portal
feasibility study. Neither of these create immediate opportunities and the
general pace of development across government remains painfully slow. Post
Office are buried in the implications of setting up the new business units and
Government Gateway does not appear to be a priority.

Work continues on developing opportunities around the SmartCard
potential, with the current major focus being support for the bid by London
Research Centre (forerunner of the new GLA IT dept) for Invest to Save
budget to implement a pilot LondonCard.

CONTACTS

° A series of meetings have been set up with Electronic Services Business Unit,
run by Jim Pang, to explore interests in secure communications including
authentication and encryption, in support of potential for ecommerce and
smartcards. It is still early days.

From a meeting with Ken Wright, MD of Corporate Clients business unit,
we learn that we have a number of clients in common eg DVLA. We are
seeking ways of opening dialogue.

* “Securing the Post Office’s Integrated Commercial Environment”: a broad
ranging invitation covering Customer Contact, Customer Relationship
Management and data warehousing. Following submission of the RFI
response on 11 Junewe learn we are not selected for shortlist/ITT. This
decision arises, as.expected, from ICL’s lack of'track record in the CRM
sector. However we will be opening discussions with shortlisted suppliers on
the long term value of Horizon.
