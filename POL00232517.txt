Susan - in case it assists revising the draft letter of complaint, I attach the "rebuttal document produced for BIS" referred to in
Mark's email below.

Hi

Thanks Susan. Further to my email below, I think we should build out a section on Nick Wallis' involvement. In a nutshell I would
be looking to say that (a) Mr Wallis' has clear views which threaten BBC impartiality (b) this point is underlined by the BBC
previously requesting that he remove a blog post on this issue (c) we were not informed that he was involved in Panorama, which
seems a breach of good faith and (d) we know he was involved because he has boasted about it on h is Facebook page. In adding this
point I think we should provide examples (Mel has them) outlining where he has gone, on his blog, beyond journalism and into
campaigning against PO.

I would also use this letter to formally question why when approaching contributors, the BBC has never featured the views of the
NFSP. Even if the NFSP has declined approaches, there is on the record footage of George Thomson talking about the issue.

I think we should ask for errors in the current BBC News Online story by John Sweeney to be corrected (i.e. it states at present that
we purused despite there being no evidence of theft - this is simply incorrect). I think we should also ask for the programme to be
removed from iplayer.

We should refer to the lack of use of public record transcripts, and cite specific points which would knock down some of the
Panorama points. We might even consider using the excellent rebuttal document produced for BIS as an annex to our complaint.

Thoughts?

Mark

Thanks Susan. I would like to review the complaint again in the light of the meeting: actually to make it even more comprehensive.
I think we need to formally note the views and involvement of Nick Wallis.

Thanks
