Doc for select committee
Document .docx
BISC 03 02 15.docx

I have done an initial mark-up of the transcript (attached) of those areas where we need to rebut/send a note and I
have an idea of a for a format which I also attach. I hope it is self-explanatory and I think Andy Parsons has all the
information at his fingertips (some of which was relevant to the BBC responses).

Can I suggest as a way forward that we ask Andy to complete the doc — I know we are terming it rebuttals but I think it
should just be cold hard facts which we can evidence/source. That should be much more powerful in terms of landing
our points and I think we should make the points even where angela made them clearly in her evidence. We can also
use it as a way of clarifying our position on any areas which may be unclear having read the transcript.

Please shout if that does not make sense or is inconvenient. I think that a lot of this should be a lift from previous

docs (part two response etc.)

I think we should have a first draft by tomorrow? Is this doeable? Andy?

Jane, I assume this is OK with you and you will hold the pen finally in terms of finessing this from a PA perspective.

Best wishes

Belinda
