Mark

Thanks for your speaking note for Paula which she found very helpful.

Paula asked us to test the argument about making the working group redundant if we were to agree a general
presumption of mediation if recommended by SS:
- How do we strengthen our argument given we appointed SS, and the role have the group has evolved given
JFSA’s line?
- If Tony Hooper supports a presumption of mediation (is this right?), how do we manage the risk to our
position of him making this known?

Very happy to discuss
Gavin
