4 Process Flow Charts
4.1 CD Despatch Process
Process Owner: Customer Service - Information Analyst
Process Objective: To ensure timely and secure despatch of
reports to the Contracting Authorities.
Process Rationale: The IA will generate from the Scheduling List a

CD Despatch Log (Appendix 1) containing
details of reports to be sent to the CA. The IA
copies the report outputs onto the CD as
directed by the CD Despatch Log. If a report
output is unavailable the IA implements the
Non-Receipt Process. The CD reference
number is written on the CD with the
appropriate permanent marker. On completion
of the production of the CD the CD Despatch
Log is signed off by the IA. The CD is then sent
by Royal Mail Special Delivery (Appendix 3) to
the addressee, the Certificate of Despatch
being attached to the CD Despatch Log and
the log updated with the PO Counter
Reference. Once the Advice of Delivery Note
is received the CD Despatch Log is updated
and filed. If the Advice of Delivery Note has not
been received within 3 days of date of
despatch the addressee is contacted in order
to confirm delivery. If the addressee stipulates
that they have not received the CD then the
Non-Receipt Process is invoked.

Customer Service - Information Analyst

To provide a controlled environment in which
non receipt of reports can be processed and
remedial action implemented.

On finding that a report has not been run as
scheduled the IA completes the relevant
sections of the Report Problems Log and then
arranges for the report to be run. The cause
of the problem is then determined and
documented on the report problems log.
Remedial action is implemented as appropriate
and logged In the event that a CD has not be
received then the exact cause of the problem is
investigated and documented on the Report
Problems Log. Concurrently a new CD is
produced and despatched. The IC is informed
and completes an impact assessment.
Remedial action is determined and
implemented.

In the event that the CA receives a CD which
they determine does not contain the outputs
desired then they shall inform the IA. He will
document the exact complaint on the Report
Problems Log. Should he determine that there
has been an omission from the CD the output
will be provided to the CA with all reasonable
expediency. Any other matters will be passed
to the joint review committee.
