with the matters set out in the Rule 9 Request dated 26 January 2023.

2. I was a sub postmaster between 1989 and 1991 (approximately) at Oldcotes
Post Office, Worksop, Nottinghamshire. I was a relief counter clerk for GT
News based at Dinnington Post Office. I was a counter clerk for Martins
newsagents, Worksop (between 1993 and 2001 approximately). I was
Manager at Hartley Brook Road Post Office, Sheffield for GT News. I was
Assistant Manager at Dinnington Post Office for GT News. I was then a Senior
Advisor at Network Business Support Centre (‘NBSC”), Brampton (between
approximately 2001 and 2006). I was a Customer Care Officer at NBSC Brampton.
Retired in 2006, when I took redundancy.

3. I think I received my Horizon training whilst I was a relief counter clerk at
Dinnington Post Office and also as part of my induction training for the NBSC.

4, When working in the NBSC I was employed as a Senior Advisor POL and
later as a Customer Care Officer by POL/Royal Mail. If Tier 1 Advisors could

not answer the postmaster's enquiry they transferred the call through to a

consider to be important to the Inquiry’s terms of reference.

for assistance.
