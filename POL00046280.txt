Hi Steve

So far I have checked and no call reference H22766041 appears to exist for 19 April 2010.

I cannot find H22792410 in 24 June and therefore also checked 25 June with same result.

It should be noted that H22792410 is not a valid incident range for the dates given I can
therefore only assume that either the date given is incorrect or the reference is invalid.
Unfortunately we are unable to search by incident so we need the correct branch code if these
were not for Birkenshaw, or the correct date or reference

21/07/2010-H2572046 and 01/08/2010-T1687336 are both an invalid references as they
are short a number

The only remaining alternative is to run all incidents logged at NBSC for each month of the
date ranges given in the hope that they are listed some where.

I have been processing your request since 14:00 this afternoon and have yet to successfully
extract a monthly report due to the volume of calls.

Without further clarification of branch code or the correct dates this request becomes
considerably more complex.

I will work until the building closes at 18:30 however, it is extremely unlikely that I will be able
to provide you with what you need at such short notice, due to the above.

If the previous attachment listing calls for Birkenshaw is sufficient please advise

Many thanks
Emma

Hi Steve

Attached is a list of calls made by Birkenshaw branch 8 July 2008 until 8 February 2011

As you can see only two are listed

01/08/2010-T16873336

27/10/2010-H-16951682

lam running an all calls logged report for all branches by the dates below with no branch code (which is taking
quite some time) but so far without success e.g. 19/04/2010 — H22766041 is not present 24/06/2010 —
H22792410 is also not present (on the dates given).

I will send you anything I can produce by cop today.

I also have a call in with CSC asking them to confirm if they have actually archived data from NBSC between Dec
2009 — 01 May 2010

Many thanks

Hi Steve
Do all of the reference numbers apply to Birkenshaw FAD 163306?

I ask as some of the references below do not appear for this site and I have looked back to Jan 2010.
Call logs for this branch will only return from 14 May 2010 onwards?

I can dig further but need to know if they are all logged against the same fad code

Many thanks

I have been speaking with Julie who tells me that NBSC call logs begin with the Letter H and Fujitsu call logs begin with the

letter A.

Sorry to be a pain but can you identify the following reference numbers and what problem they relate to?
19/04/2010 ~ H-22766041

24/06/2010 ~ H-22792410
21/07/2010-H2572046
16/08/210-H-16795487
01/08/2010-T1687336
06/'10/2010-H16923076
27/10/2010-H-16951682

The info is required for court on Monday morning,
Thanks

Afternoon

Please see below from Steve Bradshaw in the Security Team.

Fujitsu advise that a request for the HSD call logs for this branch needs to go via our security team into theirs
(Penny Thomas and Andy Dunks area).

We do not require branch transaction logs we only require a record of calls made by the above branch from 8 July
2008 until 8 February 2011.

Would it be possible for you to progress this and have the logs sent to Steve Bradshaw

Many thanks
