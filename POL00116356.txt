This is the best I could get. Timings with SS and JFA are cut down. Need to look again at PO contribution to see what
we can fit into 20 minutes.

Hi Janet
Sorry for the delay in getting back to you — I was called away briefly. Rather than saying Post Office Cases could you
say ‘with Post Office, Second Sight and JFSA’. Suggested wording below.

I have also left a message on your voicemail. Do you want to give me a ring on} when you are free?
Best wishes -

Hi Belinda

Thank you for the conversation we have just had. I think everyone understands the delicacy surrounding individual
cases and the confidentiality which must surround them, please be assured of that. The point that ought to be
emphasized from here is that MPs come at this from the point of view of their constituents rather than being
concerned about the health of the enterprise. I am sure you know this, but it is worth stating.

How does the following suit as an email going out to all MPs from James as a reminder for the meeting? Let’s just
leave it brief, and everything can be discussed in the meeting itself. The timings were discussed by James and Paula in
their phone call this week, but please confirm they are OK. We’ve spoken to Second Sight and to Alan, all of whom
know and are comfortable with the fact that they are not speaking on behalf of the working group. To some extent,
this is going to be a very dull meeting, which is absolutely fine.

Hope this suits!

Dear Mr Arbuthnot

I wanted to ensure you've seen a copy of the follow up email we’ve sent to MPs with an interest in the
mediation scheme.

With best wishes
Jane Hill

As you are aware, the Post Office has established a mediation scheme to help resolve concerns raised by
some sub postmasters. The scheme is being overseen by a Working Group, with an independent Chair
(Sir Anthony Hooper, a former Appeal Court Judge), comprising representatives from Post Office,
accountants Second Sight and JFSA.

You will have received an invitation from James Arbuthnot to a meeting on 24" March as well as an offer to
meet with the Post Office individually to discuss the scheme.

Please do let me know if you have any questions or if you would like to meet with us (either before or after
the 24" March) — we would be more than happy to do so.

Best wishes
