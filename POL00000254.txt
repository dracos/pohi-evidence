SECTION 1

SUBPOSTMASTERS' CONTRACT AND STATUS

CONTRACT

accommodation required by Post Office Limited, and pay also at his own expense, any assistants
he may need to carry on Post Office business.

when it may be necessary to attend at PM.

The Subpostmaster is not obliged to attend the Post Office branch personally but he is required,
whether he is there or not, to accept full responsibility for the proper running of his Post Office
branch and the efficient provision of those Post Office services which are required to be provided
there. Retention of the appointment as Subpostmaster is dependent on the Post Office branch
being well managed and the work performed properly to the satisfaction of Post Office Limited

The Subpostmaster is informed at the time of his appointment of the classes of business he is
required to provide. He must also undertake, if called upon to do so later, any other class of
business not required at the time of his appointment but which Post Office Limited may
subsequently and reasonably require him to do, except that Post Office Limited may not require him
to undertake Mailwork where the Subpostmaster did not undertake to do so as part of the terms of
his appointment.

If Post Office Limited alters the services to be provided or withdraws a service the Subpostmaster
has no claim to compensation for any disappointment which may result from the change.

The terms of the appointment of Subpostmaster do not entitle the holder to be paid sick or annual
leave or any pension.

If on resignation of his appointment the Subpostmaster disposes of his private business and/or
premises in which the Post Office branch is situated, the person acquiring the private business
and/or the premises or exchanging contracts in connection with the purchase of the private
business and/or premises will not be entitled to preferential consideration for appointment as
Subpostmaster providing Post Office Limited acts for a proper purpose and in accordance with its
duty of good faith when exercising its discretion as to the appointment of a new Subpostmaster.

consequence.

The Agreement may be determined by Post Office Limited:

10.2.1 at any time in case of Breach of Condition by the Subpostmaster, or non-performance of

repudiatory breach.

SECTION 3

SUBPOSTMASTERS' ABSENCE FROM OFFICE

GENERAL

POL00000254
POL00000254

A Subpostmaster, under the terms of his contract, is not obliged to render personal service and is therefore
free to absent himself from the office, provided he makes suitable arrangements for the conduct of the
office during his absence.

He should notify the Regional General Manager on form P2593 when he will be away for a period of more

than 3 days and give the name of the person substituting for him.

A Subpostmaster's responsibility for the proper conduct of the office, or for any losses occurring during his
absence, is in no way diminished by his absence from the Post Office branch. He must make proper
provision, at his own expense, for the conduct of the office while he is away, but assistance towards the
cost of his own substitution is provided, in respect of certain absences, under the terms outlined in other
relative sections listed below:

SECTION 4

ABSENCE ON HOLIDAY - HOLIDAY SUBSTITUTION ALLOWANCE

1.

NOTE:

A Subpostmaster is not entitled to annual leave as such, but subject to the following conditions he
may claim for reimbursement of the necessary cost of his substitution when taking a holiday. To
qualify for reimbursement, the Subpostmaster must be able to certify that he renders on overage
not less than 18 hours personal services each week.

The reimbursement of the costs of substitution is paid as Holiday Substitution Allowance and the
maxima payable are published annually in Counter News. The sum reimbursable is the net
additional cost necessarily incurred by the Subpostmaster in providing during his own absence for
the Post Office duties which he normally performs.

To assist Subpostmasters to overcome the difficulties sometimes experienced in obtaining suitable
substitutes in a particular year the holiday substitution allowance extends over a period of 2 years.
The holiday periods for which the costs of substitution are payable are:-

For a Subpostmaster with less than 10 years' service; a total not exceeding 7 weeks in a period of
24 months beginning 1 April in every odd year; 7 weeks for this purpose consist of 42 weekdays
plus not more than 7 associated Sundays.

For a Subpostmaster with 10 years or more aggregated service; a total not exceeding 8 weeks in a
period of 24 months beginning 1 April in every odd year; 8 weeks for this purpose consists of 48
weekdays plus not more than 8 associated Sundays.

Subject to the above limits on holiday periods, Subpostmasters may claim reimbursement of
substitution costs for absences of less than 3 days, provided that claims are aggregated and made
quarterly.

Proportionate adjustments will be made to the period for which reimbursement can be claimed
when a Subpostmaster qualifies for the higher allowance during the 2 year cycle.

Subject to the limits in paragraphs 3, 4 & 5, a Subpostmaster is free to take up to the maximum of
the period for which he may claim holiday substitution allowance at any time during the 2 year cycle
provided that he makes suitable arrangements for the conduct of the office during his absence. A
further cycle will recur in every odd year.

The Subpostmaster must do his best to find his own substitute and make all necessary
arrangements for his absence, which should be notified to the Regional General Manager on form
P2593. In cases of difficulty the Regional General Manager or the Secretary of the local branch of
the National Federation of Sub-Postmasters may be able to give the names and addresses of local
people known to be willing to offer their services as holiday reliefs to Subpostmasters.
Responsibility for concluding arrangements with such people remains with the Subpostmaster
concerned.

CLAIMS FOR REIMBURSEMENT

9.

The Subpostmaster must submit a formal claim for reimbursement of the holiday substitution
allowance on forms P2340 and P2340(A) (obtainable from the Regional General Manager) within
three months of the end of the period of substitution to which the claim relates, except in the cases
as in paragraph 10 where claims should be submitted quarterly. He must certify:-

9.41 that he has taken a holiday both from the Post Office branch and from his private business
during the whole period covered by the claim; and

9.2 that in respect of the services he provided as subpostmaster, he has actually and
necessarily incurred additional expenditure equating to the amount claimed, in respect of a paid
substitute or substitutes, payment will not be made in respect of substitution by family members
who work in the Post Office branch unless their involvement is occasional or, if regular, minimal.

POL00000254
POL00000254

Claims for refundment of substitution costs for absences of less than 3 days (see Note at
paragraph 5) should be submitted on form P2340 and P2340(A) at the quarter end, showing the
separate dates of absence and the costs of substitution incurred. In addition to the arrangement
quoted above, with effect from January 1990 all claims for reimbursement of the cost of employing
a Substitute for periods longer than 2 days in the event of holiday or sickness, should be submitted
for payment to the Regional Office no later than six months following the date the claim is made.

Where a Subpostmaster is employed by the Royal Mail Group either on a full or part-time basis,
e.g. Auxiliary Postman, it is essential, in view of the terms of the certificate required as a condition
of refundment of the cost of his substitution as Subpostmaster, that he should be absent from all
Royal Mail Group work during his holiday as Subpostmaster.

A Subpostmaster who holds more than one Post Office branch appointment and who satisfies the
general conditions entitling him to claim reimbursement must also satisfy the further condition that
he is absent from all his Post Office branchs at the same time, i.e. irrespective of the number of
Post Office branch appointments held, he shall only be entitled to claim reimbursement for a total
period of:-

12.1 not more than 7 weeks in the 24 months beginning 1 April in every odd year, if he has less
than 10 years service;

12.2. not more than 8 weeks in the 24 months beginning 1 April in every odd year, if he has 10
years or more aggregated service.

Only one claim for reimbursement is admissible and not one claim per office held.

Reimbursement of the cost of annual holiday warranted under the foregoing rules will be suitable
restricted in respect of a Subpostmaster's first and last 2 years of appointment to amounts
proportionate to the actual periods of appointment during those years; any overpayments which
may thus occur will be recovered subsequently.

PREPARATION OF CASH ACCOUNTS DURING ABSENCE ON HOLIDAY

15.

16.

19.

A Subpostmaster is allowed to dispense with the preparation of cash accounts on up to 3 occasions
in each accounting/financial year during his own absence on holiday. On one occasion a cash
account may cover up to 3 weeks transactions, and on two additional occasions 2 weeks
transactions. Alternatively, on two occasions a cash account may cover up to 3 weeks transactions.
In no circumstances may two occasions be consecutive.

Applications to dispense with cash accounts should be made on form P2639, to Regional General
Managers at least 2 weeks before the date of absence, but they can only be allowed when the 2 or
3 weeks involved fall within the same accounting period. (The accounting periods are shown in
front of the cash book).

“Despatch of Accounts" instructions to cover the period concerned will be supplied by FC4.3/CAG
Chesterfield and for Scotland, Scottish Accounting Office AD1.

It will not be possible to dispense with 2 consecutive cash accounts when one or both of them, or
the next account that would be due, is for longer than a normal cash account week, e.g. Christmas.
and New Year. However, applications to dispense with one account at such times will be
considered.

Where a cash account is prepared during the Subpostmaster's absence on holiday and is signed by
a substitute on his behalf, a note to this effect should be made on the Account.

SECTION 6
ABSENCE FOR JURY SERVICE
1. A Subpostmaster who receives a summons to serve on a jury should notify his Regional General

Manager immediately, and should inform him of the arrangements which he proposes to make for
the conduct of the work of the Post Office branch in his absence.

2. Where exceptionally the Subpostmaster is unable to find a substitute and the Post Office branch is

payment for the period of the closure will be withheld.

3. Subpostmasters attending for jury service should claim from the court any allowances for which
they are eligible in respect of travelling and subsistence and, where appropriate, compensation for
loss of remuneration. If a Subpostmaster is in need of advice of the allowances to which he will be
entitled, he should seek it from the official responsible for the issue of the summons.

SECTION 7

SUBPOSTMASTER'S SICK ABSENCE SCHEME - SUBSTITUTION ALLOWANCE

1.

A Subpostmaster is not required to give personal service and is not entitled to sick leave as such.
However, subject to certain conditions and limitations described below, he is entitled to claim sick
absence substitution allowance, in respect of the costs of substitution necessarily incurred, when
he is absent from his Post Office branch through illness.

CONDITIONS AND LIMITATIONS

2.

With the exception of women over 65 and men over 70 years of age, all Subpostmasters who give
18 hours or more personal service a week, who are absent from their Post Office branch through
illness, are eligible to claim Sick Absence Substitution Allowance. The maxima rates payable are
published from time to time in Counter News. The allowance is payable subject to, and in
accordance with, the following conditions:-

The allowance will be payable when the period of any continuous sick absence amounts to three
weeks (21 days including Sundays) or more and it will be paid retrospectively for all but the first
week (seven days including Sunday) of absence.

Payment of the allowance will be limited to an aggregated period of 13 weeks (91 days including
not more than 13 associated Sundays) in any consecutive period of 12 months.

Where a Subpostmaster is incapacitated by an accident or illness which results, or is likely to result,
in a continuous absence beyond 13 weeks, Regional General Managers may authorise payment of
the allowance to be extended up to a maximum period of 26 weeks (182 days including not more
than 26 associated Sundays) in any one period of 12 months. Where a Subpostmaster has already
received up to 12 weeks of the Sick Absence Substitution Allowance entitlement in the previous 12
months he may, because of an absence resulting from an extended illness, be entitled to an
allowance up to a maximum of 26 weeks in any one period of 12 months.

Where a Subpostmaster's period of reimbursement of sick absence substitution costs is extended
beyond 13 continuous weeks, such extension will be reviewed periodically. Under no
circumstances will a Subpostmaster be allowed to aggregate separate periods of sick absence
beyond 13 weeks in any one period of 12 months.

The maximum allowance payable will be the total amount calculated by applying the
Subpostmaster's appropriate Holiday Substitution Allowance rate for the period for which sick
absence allowance is payable, or the actual additional costs of substitution incurred for the same
period, whichever is less.

The maximum amount of the allowance for the period of absence for which an allowance is payable
will be abated, where applicable, by the statutory national insurance sickness benefit or maternity
allowance and earnings related supplement received by the claimant in respect of the same period.
Details of these are recorded on DSS forms BS12 and BF168 which should accompany the
Subpostmaster's claim for the substitution allowance (see paragraph 10). Where however, a
Subpostmistress receives a NHS Maternity Grant, the substitution allowance should not be reduced
by the amount of that grant.

(NOTE: Statutory national insurance sickness benefit means that benefit which is payable to a
person otherwise than in respect of another person who is a child or an adult dependent.) Where a
Subpostmaster is not eligible for DSS benefits, a medical certificate should accompany the claim
for payment of the substitution allowance.

Subpostmasters holding more than one Post Office branch appointment will be entitled to claim the
allowance in respect of only one appointment.

Any Subpostmaster who qualifies for the sick absence substitution allowance and can produce
evidence to show that substitution costs were incurred should submit a claim to the Regional
13
POL00000254
POL00000254

General Manager after he has been absent for three weeks. Thereafter he should claim the
allowance at the end of each subsequent period of absence of four weeks (or at the end of the
period of absence if that is reached earlier). Claim forms will be supplied by the Regional General
Manager on request.

PERIODS OF SICK ABSENCE OF LESS THAN 3 WEEKS.

11.

Where an eligible Subpostmaster as defined above is absent sick for a period of less than three
weeks, and does not qualify for payment of the sick absence substitution allowance, he will be free
to claim, in respect of any substitute for him, Holiday Substitution Allowance for the period of
absence up to the limit of any outstanding balance of his HSA entitlement. Form P2340 and
P2340(A) should be used by Subpostmasters when making these claims. The amounts payable will
not be the subject to abatement of any national insurance sickness benefit received. Any period of
sick absence for which HSA (as distinct from Sick Absence Substitution Allowance) is paid will
count against HSA entitlement.

SECTION 8

STATUTORY SICK PAY SCHEME

INTRODUCTION

1.

Under the terms of the Social Security and Housing Benefits Act 1982 employers are responsible
for statutory sick pay arrangements in respect of their employees. An employee is interpreted as
including office holders who receive emoluments liable for income tax under Schedule E.
Subpostmasters come within this category and consequently Post Office Limited is obliged to
comply with the conditions of the Act.

2. The use of the words "employee" and "employer" are used in the context of this particular piece of
legislation and do not in any way alter the Subpostmaster's status as an independent contractor.

GENERAL

3. Under the terms of the Scheme most Subpostmasters will not get State sickness benefit for their
first twenty eight weeks of sickness in each tax year. Instead they will get Statutory Sick Pay,
known as SSP, from Post Office Limited. SSP is paid at a flat rate. There are 2 weekly rates and
eligibility depends on an employee's average earnings over a specified period. There are no
allowances for dependants. SSP is taxable and subject to NI contributions.

EXCLUSIONS

4. A Subpostmaster will not get statutory sick pay if he comes within one of the following groups. If a

Subpostmaster falls within one of these groups he should still notify his Regional General Manager
about his sickness.

A Subpostmaster reaches the end of his entitlement to SSP from Post Office when:
(a) Subpostmasters who already had twenty eight weeks of SSP from Post Office
Limited in a tax year in any one period of incapacity for work (referred to as PIW)
(linked or unlinked);
(b) his linked PIW with Post Office Limited has run for 3 years;
(c) she is pregnant and reaches the "disqualifying period";
(d) his contract for service ends;

(e) Subpostmasters who fall sick in a country outside the EEC;

(f) he is no longer incapable of work, i.e. he returns to work or stops sending
certificates of incapacity;

(g) he is taken into legal custody.

QUALIFYING CONDITIONS

5.

Statutory Sick Pay can only be paid for qualifying days. It has been agreed with the National
Federation of Sub-Postmasters that qualifying days for Subpostmasters will be those days they are
normally required to provide the services detailed in Section 1 of this contract. Where
Subpostmasters are required to give services for only part of the day, that day will count in full for
statutory sick pay purposes. For the majority of Subpostmasters there will be six qualifying days in
each week (Monday to Saturday). if a Subpostmaster is in doubt about which days are regarded as
qualifying days he should seek confirmation from his Regional General Manager.
(a)
(b)
(c)
(d)

(e)

POL00000254
POL00000254

The entitlement of a Subpostmaster to SSP, rests on 6 qualifying conditions, all of which must be
fulfilled.

The Subpostmaster must have notified his Regional General Manager of his absence;
Days sickness must be days of incapacity;
The Subpostmaster must provide evidence of incapacity;

Period of incapacity for work (PIW) must be formed and PIW consist of 4 or more consecutive days,
including Saturdays, Sundays and Public Holidays, when a Subpostmaster is incapacitated for
work. It is immaterial for this purpose whether or not the Subpostmaster would normally have
worked on those days. PIW's which are separated by 8 weeks (56 calendar days) or less are linked
and count together as a single PIW;

When a Subpostmaster falls into one or more of the categories listed below he will be excluded
from receiving SSP;

(i) he is excluded from receiving SSP. A Subpostmaster who has been excluded
cannot return to SSP entitlement during the course of a PIW, nor at the start of a
PIW which links with a previous one during which he was excluded even though
he ceases to be a member of an excluded group.

(ii) Over State pension age;

A Subpostmaster who is over State pension age (65 for a man, 60 for a woman) is
excluded from SSP. However, if when a Subpostmaster reaches State pension
age he has a PIW which links with a previous one, he will be entitled to SSP for as
long as his PIW's continue to link.

(iii) Short contract workers;

A Subpostmaster whose contract of employment is for a specified period of 3
calendar months or less is excluded from SSP. However, if the contract does not
at first exceed 3 months, but a Subpostmaster works past the time stated in the
contract so that the total period worked becomes more than 3 calendar months the
employee becomes entitled to SSP as soon as it is known that the total period will
be more than 3 calendar months.

(iv;

Low average earnings;

A Subpostmaster whose average earnings are less than the lower earnings limit
for NI contribution liability is not entitled to SSP. When one PIW links with a
previous one, the first day in the earlier PIW is used for calculating an employee's
average earnings.

(v

Recent State benefit entitlement;

A Subpostmaster who has received, or in some cases claimed but not received,
certain State benefits within the 8 weeks period before the first day of a PIW is not
entitled to SSP. The benefits are:

— Sickness Benefit;

— Invalidity Benefit;

~ Severe Disablement Allowance;

~ State Maternity Allowance (but not Statutory Maternity Pay);

— Unemployment Benefit, but only in very limited circumstances.
POL00000254
POL00000254

(vi) No work done;

A Subpostmaster how has done no work under a contract of employment is not
entitled to SSP under that contract. If he is a new employee and he reports sick
before he takes up duty, he is not entitled to SSP. However, if he reports for work
on his first day of service, but goes sick on the second, he is entitled to SSP if he
fulfils the other qualifying conditions.

(vii) Trade dispute;

If a Subpostmaster is participating in a stoppage of work due to a trade dispute, he
may be excluded from SSP.

(viii) Pregnancy;

There is a "disqualifying period" during which the Subpostmistress is not entitled to
SSP. The "disqualifying period" begins with the 11th week before the expected
week of confinement and runs for 18 weeks. This is the same as the period for
entitlement to state or statutory maternity pay to which the Subpostmistress is
entitled provided she fulfils the appropriate conditions.

(ix) Already been due 28 weeks SSP from former employer(s);

A Subpostmaster is excluded from SSP if he gives his Regional General Manager
a leaver's statement (SSP 1(L)) showing that he has been due 28 weeks SSP from
his former employer(s) and the gap between the first day of the PIW (with the new
employer) and the last day of SSP shown on the leaver's statement is 8 weeks or
less.

(x) Abroad outside the EEC;

A Subpostmaster who is abroad outside the EEC at the start of a PIW is not
entitled to SSP. He is excluded even it the PIW links with a previous one when he
was in the UK.

(xi) Legal custody.

A Subpostmaster who is in legal custody on the first day of a PIW is not entitled to
SSP. "Legal custody” means that the person concerned is detained, usually
arrested and/or in prison. A person who is voluntarily helping Police with their
enquiries is not excluded. A Subpostmaster in legal custody is not entitled to SSP
even if his PIW links with a previous one when he was not in legal custody.

(xii) Days of incapacity to be a qualifying day.

If a Subpostmaster becomes incapable of work part way through a day, that day
cannot count as a qualifying day unless he has not commenced work on that day.

NOTIFICATION OF SICKNESS

7. A Subpostmaster or his representative must inform his Regional General Manger by telephone of
his incapacity for work on or before his first working day of sickness irrespective of whether he is
entitled to statutory sick pay.

8. Subpostmasters, including those nominated by limited companies, who hold more than one
appointment, must notify the appropriate Regional General Manager who is responsible for the
collection of primary National Insurance contributions in respect of his appointments. (See section
10, paragraph 1)

9. If a Subpostmaster is late in giving notification of sickness, he should advise the Regional General
Manager of the reason for the delay. If the Regional General Manager is not satisfied with the

17
POL00000254
POL00000254

reason given for the delay, any period of sickness prior to the date of notification will not count for
the purposes of statutory sick pay. If a Subpostmaster is not satisfied with the Regional General
Manager's decision on this matter he may apply to the Department of Social Security for a ruling. If
a Subpostmaster does not qualify for statutory sick pay, he will on notification of sickness be sent a
form SSP1 (E) by his Regional General Manager.

EVIDENCE OF SICKNESS

10. Subpostmasters must provide Post Office Limited with evidence of incapacity for work by means of
either a doctor's medical certificate of by a self certificate if the incapacity is less than eight days. A
proforma to be used for self certification can be obtained from the Regional General Manager.

14. Subpostmasters must notify their Regional General Manager when they cease to be sick.
END OF ENTITLEMENT TO STATUTORY SICK PAY

12. When a Subpostmaster has exhausted his entitlement to statutory sick pay he will be sent a form
SSP1(T), on which, if he is still sick, he can claim state sickness benefit from the Department of
Social Security.

RULES OF PAYMENT

13. In accordance with the Act, Post Office Limited is obliged to abate any remuneration due by the
appropriate amount of statutory sick pay. The effect of this will mean that for the first eight weeks of
sickness, remuneration will be paid in full and that statutory sick pay will be regarded as "notional".
Consequently although statutory sick pay will be regarded as "notional" the total remuneration paid
the Subpostmaster will continue to attract income tax and National Insurance contributions in full.

DUAL EMPLOYMENT

14. If a Subpostmaster who is sick is also employed either by the Royal Mail Group (e.g. as an
Auxiliary Postman) or another employer, and provided National Insurance contributions are paid
separately for each employment and all other conditions are met, he must claim statutory sick pay
in respect of both his Subpostmaster services and other employment(s).

SICK ABSENCE SUBSTITUTION SCHEME

15. The provisions of this Scheme, which are set out in Section 5, remain except that no claim will be
entertained unless the Regional General Manager has been properly notified of the
Subpostmaster's sickness. Claims for reimbursement for up to 28 weeks' sick absence will not be
subject to abatement in respect of Statutory Sick Pay. Claims for reimbursement for a period of
sickness which does not attract statutory sick pay will continue to be subject to abatement.

RESIGNATION AND RETIREMENT
RESIGNATION
1. A Subpostmaster who wishes to resign his appointment must give 3 calendar month's notice in

writing. If he does not give such notice Post Office Limited may require him to pay any expense
which it incurs in providing temporary arrangements to cater for the business which would normally
be expected to be transacted at the Post Office branch during any part of the 3 month notice

period.
RETIREMENT
2. There is no specific age limit for the retirement of a Subpostmaster.
3. Unless indicated otherwise by the Regional General Manager, a vacancy will be advertised at the

existing Post Office branch premises.

4. Subpostmasters at offices earning 125,050 units or more are required to make an introductory
payment to Post Office Limited as a condition of appointment.

POL00000254

POST OFFICE LIMITED
SECTION 10
NATIONAL INSURANCE
CLASSIFICATION
1. For National Insurance purposes, a Subpostmaster is regarded as an office holder with
emoluments chargeable to Income Tax under Schedule E. As such, all Subpostmasters are liable
to make National Insurance contributions in accordance with the provisions of Class 1.
Class 1 contributions comprise 2 parts:-
(a) the Primary contribution which is generally known as the employee's contribution;
(b) the Secondary contribution which is generally known as the employer's contribution.
PERSONS TAKING UP APPOINTMENT AS A SUBPOSTMASTER
2. All persons taking up an appointment as a Subpostmaster should supply the Regional General
Manager with their National Insurance number by means of a NI number card, form P45 and/or P60
(see leaflet NI217) and also any current certificate of Earner’s non/reduced rate liability that they
have. Where for one reason or another a new Subpostmaster does not supply a NI number the

action outlined in the Employer's Guide to National Insurance Contributions (NP15) will be followed.

CONTRACTING OUT

3. Under the Social Security Act 1975, pensions for retirement, widowhood and invalidity consist of 2
parts:-

(a) basic pension;

(b) and additional pension related to an employee's reckonable earnings between the
lower earnings limit and the upper earnings limit.

4. An employer may contract his employees out of that part of the State Scheme which provides an
additional pension if the Occupational Pensions Board is satisfied that his occupational pensions
scheme meets the conditions required by the Act. As Subpostmasters are not employees of Royal
Mail Group plc they are ineligible to belong to any of Royal Mail's occupational pension schemes
and therefore are not contracted out of the State Scheme.

CONTRIBUTIONS

5. DSS leaflet NP15 "Employer's Guide to National Insurance Contributions" gives a guide to the
contribution arrangements.

6. Provided that earnings reach or exceed the lower earnings limit, a Subpostmaster will be liable to
pay primary contributions on all earnings up to the upper earnings limit at:-

(a) the standard rate; or
(b) the reduced rate (see paragraph 8); or

(c) is not liable for contributions because he/she is over pension age or has made other
arrangements (see paragraph 9).

20
POL00000254
POL00000254

MARRIED WOMEN AND WIDOWS

7. There is no longer a right to choose to pay reduced rate contributions. However, a woman entitled
to pay at the reduced rate for the 1977-78 tax year continues to be able to do so for subsequent
years unless:-

(a) she revokes her election;
(b) as a married woman her marriage ends in divorce or annulment;

(c) she becomes a widow and after the initial period becomes entitled to widow's
benefit;

(d) during 2 consecutive tax years which fall after 5 April 1978 she was neither liable to
pay a Class 1 contribution nor was self-employed.

DSS will provide a certificate authorising deductions of a Class 1 contributor's contribution at the
reduced rate. As Post Office Limited will be held responsible for any deficiencies in contribution,
deductions will be made at the standard rate unless the Subpostmistress produces a valid
certificate.

NON LIABLE SUBPOSTMASTERS

8. No contributions are payable by men over 65 or women over 60 and in such circumstances DSS
will normally issue a certificate of age contribution. However, if some other definite evidence is
being held to show that a Subpostmaster has reached age 65 (60 for a woman) his/her deductions
may be ceased even though a certificate of age exception has not been produced.

9. The Secondary contribution (see paragraph 2) is due at the same rate regardless of the
Subpostmaster's rate of contribution or even where he is non liable.

ARREARS OF REMUNERATION

10. Arrears of remuneration resulting from a revision or other payments made to adjust remuneration
paid in an earlier month, will be treated as part of the total remuneration in the month in which the
payment is made, regardless of the period for which they are proper to. This applies whether or not
the additional payments are made regularly.

41. Where arrears of remuneration are due to a former Subpostmaster national insurance contributions
will be calculated from the weekly contributions table published by DSS.

DEATH OF SUBPOSTMASTERS

12. Contributions are not payable on any remuneration that might be due to a Subpostmaster's estate
after his death.

HOLIDAY AND SICK ABSENCE PAYMENTS

13. Contributions are not due on any payments made under the holiday substitution or Sick Absence
Substitution schemes because all payments are made in respect of specific costs incurred.

SICKNESS BENEFITS

14, NI Contributions continue to be payable when a Subpostmaster who is sick continues to receive his
scale payment. NI sickness/industrial injury benefits received are not assessable for NI contribution.

SUBPOSTMASTERS WITH MORE THAN ONE EMPLOYMENT

15. Primary Class 1 contributions are normally payable in respect of each job including other Post
Office branch appointments for which earnings exceed the lower earnings limit, unless a current

21
POL00000254
POL00000254

form RD950 has been received from DSS. Even where a form RD950 is held, Post Office Limited is
obliged to collect Secondary Class contributions.

16. Not used.
CHANGES IN NATIONAL INSURANCE STATUS

17. In the event of a change or impending change in national insurance status, a Subpostmaster
should consult his local DSS office as soon as possible.

18. The following are regarded as changes in status:
(a) WOMEN:
Divorce In these circumstances the Subpostmistress must advise
Annulment DSS and Post Office Limited
Marriage
Widowhood See paragraph 8
Re-marriage
Retirement age Towards the beginning of the tax year in which a woman reaches

age 60 and again at the approach of the 60th birthday, a
Subpostmistress will be asked to consult DSS so that a certificate
of age exception may be issued if appropriate (see also paragraph
9).

(a) MEN
Retirement age At the approach of the 65th birthday the Subpostmaster will be
asked to consult DSS so that a certificate of age exception may be
issued if necessary (see also paragraph 9)
DEFERMENT OF NORMAL RETIREMENT DATE
19. In all cases where a Subpostmaster seeks to enhance his retirement pension by a deferment of NI
retirement dale (normally the 60th birthday for women, the 65th birthday for men) see DSS leaflet
NI92 - or where he wishes to cancel his deferment, the Subpostmaster should be asked to consult
his local DSS office so that the necessary arrangements can be made and certificates of age
exception obtained.
RESIGNATION/TERMINATION OF APPOINTMENT

20. When a Subpostmaster resigns or has his contract terminated the Guaranteed Minimum Pension
will be preserved by DSS.

MARRIED WOMEN AND WIDOWS

21. There will be no Guaranteed Minimum Pension (GMP) for a married woman or a widow who has
retained the right to pay the reduced rate of NI contribution.

CANCELLATION OF ELECTION TO PAY AT REDUCED RATE

22. When a married woman or widow revokes her election to pay NI contributions at the reduced rate
the GMP will accrue only on the contributions she pays after revoking her election.

22
POL00000254
POL00000254

ACTUAL EXPENSES INCURRED

23. Subpostmasters who are asked by their Regional General Manager to give details of the
expenditure which they incur in providing Post Office services should do so with all haste. Such
information will be restricted to Post Office Limited and Department of Social Security.

APPENDIX 1
ACCIDENTAL LOSS

If at any time any items of stock (including stock of no intrinsic value such as motor vehicle licences) is
found to be missing. Steps must be taken at once to ascertain what has happened to the missing items.
The serial numbers must be ascertained (see 2(a)) and verified by examination of items in stock, and the
requisition forms examined to discover whether or not any of the items purport to have been issued out of
sequence. All the requisition forms for the previous 3 months must at the same time be impounded and
held for instructions. If, after careful search, the missing items cannot be found and are thought to have
been mislaid only, or inadvertently destroyed, a preliminary report of the loss giving the serial numbers of
the items in question must be sent to the Regional General Manager.

STOLEN ITEMS

1. If as a result of burglary, break in, theft, or suspected theft any items of stocks are missing the facts
should be reported as quickly as possible to the Regional General Manager.

2. The further details which will be required, and which should be obtained and submitted to the
Regional General Manager at the earliest opportunity, are as follows:

(a) The denominations, total values and serial numbers of missing or stolen items, so
far as they are known, with serial numbers of any remaining stocks.

(b) A statement as to whether the date stamp of the Post Office branch has been
stolen, and if so, particulars of the type in it when stolen. If the date stamp has not
been stolen a statement should be given which should intimate whether there is a
reason to believe that it has been used upon the stolen items.

(c) A-specimen impression of the date stamp and, if it was stolen, particulars of the type
in it when stolen.

(d) A statement of the circumstances which are thought to show that a theft has been
committed and of the supposed date, time and method of commission. It should

The Subpostmaster acknowledges that Post Office Ltd views every incident of damage to, theft or
loss of, or interference with, a Postal Packet as being very serious in nature. The Subpostmaster

POST OFFICE LIMITED
SECTION 15
ASSISTANTS
INTRODUCTION

Post Office Ltd must comply with certain obligations in relation to the Post Office® business, including
those of: Postcomm, Ofcom and Financial Services Authority regulations, and money laundering and
immigration legislation. Some of these obligations require Post Office Ltd to ensure that its
Subpostmasters (and any persons employed or engaged by Subpostmasters on Post Office® business)
are made aware of, and know how to comply with, the terms of such regulations and legislation. These
requirements have been set out in this Contract (in particular, but not limited to, this Section and the
Section dealing with Divulgence of Official Information). The obligations placed upon Subpostmasters are
the minimum necessary to ensure that both Post Office Ltd and Subpostmasters are compliant with the
regulations and legislation mentioned above, and are, in the main, what most Subpostmasters, as
responsible employers, should be doing anyway. The objectives of these obligations are:

e to ensure that Post Office Ltd complies with the relevant regulations and legislation, and

e to ensure as far as possible that Subpostmasters do so too, and that no Subpostmaster suffers
from the consequences of failure to so comply. (This is very important, as those consequences
can include criminal prosecution.)

Subpostmasters have a duty to ensure that they are aware and that they make their staff aware, of the
obligations set out in this Contract.

GENERAL

1. A Subpostmaster must provide, at his own expense, any suitable assistants with the relevant skills
which he may need to carry out the Post Office® work in his sub Post Office® branch (“Assistants”).

2. Assistants are employees of the Subpostmaster, and (subject to clause 12 of Section 12) the
Subpostmaster will consequently be held wholly responsible for any failure, on the part of his
Assistants, to:

24 apply Post Office® rules or instructions as required by Post Office Ltd,

2.2 complete any training necessary in order to properly provide Post Office® Services, provided that
the Subpostmaster shall only be required to train its Assistants to the same and not a higher
standard than the standard of training received by the Subpostmaster from Post Office Limited; and

23 comply with the obligations set out below.

The Subpostmaster will also be required to make good any deficiency of cash or stock which may
result from his Assistants’ actions or inactions in accordance with clause 5 of Section 12.

3. This Section contains the obligations which the Subpostmaster has to fulfil in relation to the
recruitment and employment of each of his Assistants (which includes any members of his own
family). Where the Subpostmaster fails to comply with any of these terms, he may be deemed to
be in breach of his Contract which may, subject to clause 10 of Section 1, then be liable to
termination. The obligations in this Section are additional to the Subpostmaster's responsibility, as
the employer of his Assistants, to comply with the provisions of any legislation and regulations that
impose obligations on employers, providers of postal services and financial services, or sellers of
insurance or communications products.

4. RECRUITMENT

44 The Subpostmaster must establish and maintain a recruitment file for each Assistant. In order to
meet its legal obligations regarding monitoring of compliance, Post Office Ltd will be entitled to

41
4.2

43

POL00000254
POL00000254

inspect such recruitment files from time to time upon giving the Subpostmaster reasonable written
notice that they should be made available for such inspection. The recruitment file should include,
in the format of the Recruitment Checklist at Appendix 3 to this Section, a comprehensive record of
all checks carried out in relation to the recruitment, selection and employment of any person
applying to him for employment as an Assistant ( defined in this Contract as the “Applicant”).

The Subpostmaster is responsible for carrying out all necessary checks in order to satisfy himself
as to the honesty, integrity and suitability of any Applicant. He must also take certain steps, as set
out below, in order to satisfy himself as to:

the right to work in the UK;

the identity and permanent National Insurance number; and

the address,

of any Applicant.

Proof of Right to Work in the UK

The following procedures are necessary to meet the requirements of immigration legislation:

Step 1

The Subpostmaster will need to ask all Applicants to provide documentation that satisfies the
criteria listed at Appendix 2 to this Section.

Step 2

The Subpostmaster must satisfy himself that the Applicant is the rightful holder of any of the
documents he presents.

The Subpostmaster must carry out the following reasonable steps when checking any documents
presented by an Applicant:

a) check any photographs, where provided, to ensure that they are consistent with the
appearance of the Applicant;

b) check that the dates of birth listed are consistent with each other and with the appearance
of the Applicant;

c) check that the expiry dates are valid and the documents are still live;

d) check any United Kingdom Government stamps or endorsements to see if the Applicant is

able to do the type of work he is offering;

e) if the Applicant gives you, from List 2 of Appendix 2, two documents that have different
names for the Applicant, you should ask him for a further document to explain the reason
for this. (The further document could be a marriage certificate, divorce document, deed
poll, adoption certificate or statutory declaration.)

Step 3

The Subpostmaster should make a photocopy of the following parts of all the documents shown to.
him for retention in the recruitment file:

a) the front cover and all of the pages which give the Applicant's personal details. In

particular, the Subpostmaster should copy: (i) the page with the photograph, and (ii) the
page which shows the Applicant's signature; and

42
44

45

46

47

POL00000254
POL00000254

b) any page containing a United Kingdom Government stamp or endorsement that permits
the Applicant to do the type of work the Subpostmaster is offering.

If it is not possible to make the necessary photocopies at the time, the documents should be
retained, copied at the earliest possible opportunity and returned to the Applicant.

Step 4

List in the Applicant's recruitment file all documents seen and copied on steps 1-3 above (e.g. ‘UK
Passport — Number 12345678’; or ‘Full birth certificate and a P60 dated 14 April 2005’).

Proof of Permanent National Insurance Number

4.44 Unless already provided and photocopied, as part of an Applicant's documentation
proving his Right to Work in the UK, the Subpostmaster will need to see a document
giving the Applicant's permanent National Insurance Number and name. This could be a:
P45, P60, National Insurance card, or a letter from a Government agency.

4.42 The Subpostmaster must then list in the Applicant's recruitment file the document seen
(there is no need to photocopy the document if it is provided solely for proving the NI
number).

443 For the small number of Applicants who are unable to supply a permanent National
Insurance number, they should be asked to explain why, the reason should be noted and
the Subpostmaster should consider carefully whether to proceed with the application.
Applicants with a genuine reason for being unable to supply a permanent National
Insurance number (such as Applicants from outside the UK) should be advised that they
would need to obtain one from the relevant authorities prior to being appointed.

Proof of Address

The Subpostmaster must see at least one of the following items showing the Applicant's name and
current address:

Driving Licence

Recent Paid Gas or Electricity Bill

Recent Paid Telephone Bill (not mobile)

Recent Paid Council Tax Bill

Recent Paid Water Bill

Recent TV Licence

Recent Bank Statement, must be supported by a credit/debit card

(In relation to the above “Recent” means no more than 3 months old.)

The Subpostmaster must then list in the Applicant's recruitment file the details of the document
seen (there is no need to photocopy the ‘proof of address’ document).

The Subpostmaster must ensure that all recruitment files for successful Applicants have been
correctly annotated and the associated photocopies have been included to provide proof of an
Applicant's right to work in the UK. There should be no missing photocopies, incorrect combinations
of documents or incomplete tick lists

The Subpostmaster must not confirm an Applicant's appointment until the criteria have been met
and the registration process outlined below has been completed.

43
48

49

4.10

POL00000254
POL00000254

It is the Subpostmaster's responsibility to ascertain that all documentation supplied by the Applicant
satisfies the criteria.

References

At the recruitment stage, the Subpostmaster will need to obtain at least 2 references (which must
be independent of the Applicant and of each other) in respect of the Applicant.

Work History

The Subpostmaster must obtain a work history from each Applicant for the immediately preceding 5
years (unless the period in which each Applicant has worked can be proved to be less than 5 years,
in which case the work history of the full period must be obtained). It is the Subpostmaster's
responsibility to assure himself of the validity and accuracy of the details provided by the Applicant.
(Measures to achieve this could include questioning at interview, and the seeking of references
from previous employers).

Honesty, Integrity and Suitability

4.11.1 The Subpostmaster must seek information from each Applicant about any unspent
convictions, including conditional discharges, for any offence in a Court of Law (including
a Youth Court or Court Martial) or any caution, reprimand or warning. The Subpostmaster
must also seek information from each Applicant about any pending criminal proceedings
in which the Applicant might be involved. The Subpostmaster must also seek information
from each Applicant about mis-selling of any product or service or lack of integrity in any
form of employment involving selling.

4.11.2 In order to help prevent the employment of unsuitable or dishonest persons on Post
Office® work, the Subpostmaster must, before the Applicant begins employment with
the Subpostmaster, complete the registration process detailed at 4.11.3 below
(defined in this Contract as the “Registration Process”). Under no circumstances must
the Subpostmaster employ an Assistant before the Registration Process is completed
and the Subpostmaster has received clearance from Post Office Ltd to employ that
Assistant. All Assistants must be registered, including members of the Subpostmaster's
family who may only occasionally work in the Post Office® branch. Holiday reliefs also
need to be registered.

4.11.3 The Registration Process

(i) To register an Applicant as an Assistant the Subpostmaster must complete forms P250
and P13. The text of form P250 is at Appendix 1 to this Section. The text of form P13 is
at Appendix 1 to the Section dealing with Divulgence of Official Information. In addition
the Applicant must complete and sign a Security Checks Consent Form. The
Subpostmaster may obtain these forms from Post Office Ltd.

(ii) Form P250. The Subpostmaster must complete and sign Section 1; the Applicant must
complete and sign Section 2. The Subpostmaster must then submit the completed form
to the address indicated on it. The Subpostmaster must ensure that any details referred
to in paragraphs 4.11.1 above and 4.11.5 below about the Applicant (defined in this
Contract as “Relevant Information”) which have come to his attention are honestly
recorded on the form. This will enable Post Office Ltd to conduct its own checks into the
background of the Applicant.

(ili) Security Checks Consent Form. The Applicant must complete this form in his own
handwriting and sign and date it. The Subpostmaster must check that form is complete
and legible and that the personal details shown on it match those entered on the P250.
The completed form should be sent with the competed P250 to the address shown on the
P250.

(iv) Form P13. If the Subpostmaster is satisfied that the identity, character, history and
suitability of any Applicant will not cause him to breach any of the obligations in this
Contract he must require that the Applicant makes a personal declaration on form P13
44
5.1

5.2

POL00000254
POL00000254

prior to commencing work in the Post Office® branch. Two copies of this form must be
completed, one of which must be kept by the Applicant, and the other should be sent,
with the completed P250 and the completed Security Checks Consent Form, to the return
address on the P250. Both the Subpostmaster and the Applicant must sign the P13.

(v) Pre-employment checks will be carried out upon receipt by Post Office Ltd of the relevant
forms, which should be fully and legibly completed. (These checks can take up to seven
working days.)

(vi) The Subpostmaster will then be informed whether or not he may employ the Applicant as
an Assistant.

4.11.4 Where Post Office Ltd has good reason to believe that it would not be in its legitimate
interests for a particular Applicant to be engaged upon Post Office® business or to have
access to any part of the Post Office® branch it will be entitled to require the
Subpostmaster to refrain from employing that Applicant on Post Office® business if not
already employed, or to ensure that the Applicant is not further employed on Post
Office® business if already employed. If after such a requirement has been reasonably
made by Post Office Ltd the Subpostmaster continues to employ such Applicant he may
be deemed to be in breach of his Contract as referred to in paragraph 3 above.

4.11.5 If details of any offences committed by the Applicant relating to:

(i) the delivery or handling of mail, post or packets; or

(ii) theft or the obtaining of property by deception or fraud; or

(iii) mis-selling of any product or service; or

(iv) lack of integrity in any form of employment involving selling; or
(v) dishonest conduct of any kind,

come to Post Office Ltd's attention by any means and Post Office Ltd notifies this fact to
the Subpostmaster the Applicant will not until further notice be eligible to work on Post
Office® business or any business concerning Royal Mail Group pic and the provisions of
paragraph 4.11.4 above will apply.

As a general guide no person under 16 years of age should be employed on Post Office® work, or
have access to Postal Packets. However where there is no reasonable alternative to the part-time
employment of an Assistant under 16 years of age, such employment must be allowed subject to
the following conditions:

no person under the age of 14 years may be employed in any capacity;

the Assistant, even if a family member, should be fully registered with Post Office Ltd in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 15; and

the Subpostmaster must comply with all relevent legislation affecting the employment of young
persons and children.

UNSUITABLE PERSONS

During the entire period that an Assistant is employed by the Subpostmaster, the Subpostmaster
will report immediately to Post Office Ltd any Relevant Information as soon as he becomes aware
of same.

If:

5.2.1 the Subpostmaster does not submit a form P250 prior to the employment by him of the
Applicant; or

45
6.1

6.2

6.3

7A

POL00000254

POLo00000254
5.2.2 the Subpostmaster does not declare on the form P250 any Relevant Information
concerning the Applicant of which he was aware; or
5.2.3 the Applicant fails any checks carried out internally by Post Office Ltd; or
5.2.4 the Subpostmaster does not report to Post Office Ltd as soon as possible any Relevant

Information of which he becomes aware (after submission of a form P250),
the provisions of paragraph 4.11.4 above will apply.
ONGOING REGISTRATION CHECKS

To meet the needs of regulation and legislation Post Office Ltd must be able to maintain accurate
details of all those who work in Post Office® branches. In addition to completing forms P250 and
P13 when employing new Assistants, the Subpostmaster is, therefore, required each year to take
part in an annual check of persons employed in Post Office® branches. The current mechanism for
this check is the form P356, which the Subpostmaster is required to fill out and return. This
provides Post Office Ltd with up-to-date details of the people working in a Post Office® branch and
acts as a monitoring check that every Assistant has been cleared through the pre-employment
checking system. It is absolutely essential that the Subpostmaster cooperates fully with this
process or any replacement process that Post Office Ltd may subsequently and reasonably require.

The details listed on form P356 for each Assistant, which the Subpostmaster will need to check for
accuracy and amend as necessary are as follows:

Post Office® branch name and address, FAD (or Branch) code

Assistant's name, date of birth and National Insurance number

Role type, (e.g. Assistant or holiday relief )

Date employment commenced and, if applicable, date employment ceased and reason for leaving
Relationship to Subpostmaster (if applicable)

Horizon Log On ID

Details must be entered on form P356 for every Assistant employed by the Subpostmaster, even if
he only works occasionally e.g. as a holiday relief.

TRAINING
Post Office Ltd will:

7.44 provide the Subpostmaster with relevant training materials and processes to carry out the
required training of his Assistants on the Post Office® Products and Services;

7412 provide adequate training and support, including through the provision of training
materials, to the Subpostmaster, particularly if and when Post Office Limited imposes
new working practices or systems or requires the provision of new services;

7.413 inform the Subpostmaster as soon as possible where new or revised training will be
necessary as a result of changes in either the law or Post Office® Products and Services;
and

7.14 where appropriate (for instance where clause 7.1.3 of this Section applies) update the
training materials (or processes) or provide new training materials (or processes) to the
Subpostmaster,

and Post Office Limited and the Subpostmaster shall co-operate in respect of the training of
Assistants in the operation of Horizon (as defined in Section 12).

46
7.2

7.3

74

8.1

8.2

POL00000254
POL00000254

However, it is the Subpostmaster's responsibility to ensure the proper deployment within his Post
Office® branch of any materials and processes provided by Post Office Ltd and to ensure that his
Assistants receive all the training which is necessary in order to be able to properly provide the
Post Office® Products and Services and to perform any other tasks required in connection with the
operation of the Post Office® branch, provided that the Subpostmaster shall only be required to
train its Assistants to the same and not a higher standard than the standard of training received by
the Subpostmaster from Post Office Limited.

Where Post Office Ltd has obligations to third parties in relation to certain Post Office® Products
and Services (including, but not limited to, financial transactions (such as bureau de change, and
sales of insurance) and communications products, and provision of mail services), the
Subpostmaster undertakes to use his best endeavours to ensure that his Assistants will not cause
Post Office Ltd to be in breach of such obligations.

Post Office Ltd may request from time to time that where it has obligations as described above the
Subpostmaster should conduct specific training (whether through written/distance learning that may
require confirmation of completion or via presentations) in relation to certain Post Office® Services
(such as, but not limited to, money laundering). Failure by the Subpostmaster to arrange for such
training to be properly applied will be deemed to be a breach of this Contract by him.

Training Policy

7.44 The Subpostmaster must formulate a training policy for all his Assistants, in order to fulfil
his obligations in relation to the safekeeping of any Postal Packets.

74.2 This training policy should include the following elements:
e the levels of training required to fulfil the obligations referred to above at 7.4.1;

e the levels of training required according to the differing responsibilities of, and work
undertaken by, the Assistants, in relation to Postal Packets;

e details of the minimum level of training required;

* an explanation of how the training is provided;

e the frequency with which training is provided; and

e details of how training is given, recorded and monitored.

74.3 The policy must also ensure compliance with all other regulatory and legislative
requirements.

744 The Subpostmaster must regularly monitor the implementation of and compliance with
the training policy in his Post Office® branch.

SECURITY

The Subpostmaster must inform each of his Assistants of the seriousness of any offence of
damage or interference to any Postal Packet.

The Subpostmaster must ensure that his Assistants comply with the requirements of the
Operations Manual, Volume 5 and the Security Booklet in general - sub sections 3, 4, and 8 in
particular, as they apply to:

the security of the premises;

the collection, despatch, conveyance or delivery of mail; and

the measures to be taken to prevent or detect loss or theft of or damage to a Postal Packet.

The Subpostmaster must maintain records which can enable him as far as is reasonably
practicable, to identify which of his Assistants was responsible for the conveyance, receipt,
collection, sortation, delivery or handling of any Postal Packet which may have been interfered with.

The Subpostmaster must carry out regular assessments of the risk to Postal Packets at the Post
Office® branch.

DISCIPLINE

The Subpostmaster is responsible for:

9.1.1 ensuring that each of his Assistants is made aware: (a) that he is responsible for the
safekeeping of Postal Packets such Postal Packets are in his custody; (b) that he must
take all reasonable measures to protect them from delay, loss, theft, damage and/or
interference of any kind, and (c) that failure by him to follow any security instruction or
procedure issued and amended (where necessary to minimise the risks referred to
above) from time to time by Post Office Ltd will be deemed to be a breach of condition of
this Contract by the Subpostmaster, and Post Office Ltd reserves the right to take
appropriate action in the circumstances; and

9.1.2 placing the obligations set out in 9.1.1 above directly upon every Assistant whom he
employs on Post Office® business.

The Subpostmaster must establish maintain and adhere consistently to a formal disciplinary policy
in respect of any of his Assistants who fails to comply with his obligations as set out in this
Contract. Where the Subpostmaster already has an established disciplinary policy for his
employees it is simply necessary to ensure that the policy meets the criteria set out in 9.3 and 9.4
below.

The policy referred to in 9.2 above must include at least the following elements:

9.3.1 an explanation of what constitutes a “failure to meet the standards of conduct”, and the
action to be taken in relation to such failure;

9.3.2 a description of how the Subpostmaster has conveyed to his Assistants:

e the fact that a failure to meet the standards of conduct might also constitute a criminal
offence; and

e the action which will be taken in relation to any such failure;

9.3.3 a provision for the appropriate records to be maintained detailing any action taken
against an Assistant for failure to meet a required standard of conduct; and

9.3.4 an explanation of:

e how the Subpostmaster identifies consistent failures to meet the relevant standards of
conduct; and

«what remedial action the Subpostmaster will take in the event of consistent failures
being made.

The Subpostmaster must regularly review :
the standards of conduct imposed; and
the disciplinary policy in place.

The Subpostmaster will keep a formal record of his disciplinary policy and any exercise by him of it,
and Post Office Ltd will be entitled to request sight of such record from time to time, where it is

reasonable to do so in order to ensure that the Subpostmaster is complying with his obligations in
this respect.

Where Post Office Ltd believes, in good faith, that a Subpostmaster has not implemented the
disciplinary policy properly (or at all) against an Assistant, where circumstances justify such
implementation, the provisions of paragraph 3 above will apply.

INFORMATION/REPORTING

The Subpostmaster must as soon as possible upon becoming aware of its occurrence, report to

Post Office Ltd every incidence of loss or theft of, damage to or interference with, a Postal Packet
(defined in this Contract as an “Incident”.

SECTION 16

DIVULGENCE OF OFFICIAL INFORMATION, CORRESPONDENCE & INTERVIEWS

DIVULGENCE OF OFFICIAL INFORMATION

1.

The unauthorised disclosure, or use, of any information or document which has come to the
knowledge of a Subpostmaster or sub Post Office® Assistant through the work of his sub Post
Office® branch is forbidden. Any such disclosure may render the offender liable to prosecution.

Neither the Subpostmaster nor his Assistants may disclose any information regarding Postal
Packets except to the person(s) to whom such Postal Packets are addressed; nor may they make
known information that may come to them directly or indirectly by means of the Post Office®
business concerning the character, standing, or responsibility of individuals or firms, or the private
affairs of any person.

PERSONAL DECLARATIONS

3.1

3.2

3.3

All new Subpostmasters and newly recruited Assistants are required to sign a Personal Declaration
(form P13 attached as Appendix 1 to this Section) which reminds them of the duty of each of Post
Office Ltd and the Royal Mail Group to ensure that all communications and items entrusted to it
reach the people for whom they are intended promptly and safely. The Personal Declaration also
brings to the notice of Subpostmasters and Assistants their obligations under the Postal Services
Act 2000. (An extract from this Act is reproduced at Appendix 2 of this Section.)

Every Subpostmaster and each of his Assistants is on termination of his appointment required to
sign a Declaration (P301) to remind him that the provisions of the Official Secrets Act continue to
apply to him after he has left in respect of all the information which he has acquired or to which he
has had access by virtue of his position as Subpostmaster or Assistant. (A copy of form P301 is at
Appendix 3 of this Section.)

The Subpostmaster must give each of his Assistants a copy of form P13 and, upon termination of
his appointment form P301, as a reminder of the importance of the messages they contain. The
duty not to disclose information is imposed by the Act referred to in 3.2 above - not by any Personal
Declarations. Consequently no Subpostmaster or Assistant can avoid these legal obligations by
refusing to sign a form or by attempting to revoke or disclaim his signature on the form(s).

Any request made to the Subpostmaster or his Assistant by the Police or any other authority, or by
a private person, for information which may be confidential, or may concern matters connected with
the duties of another Subpostmaster, Franchisee, Operator or an employee of Post Office Ltd or
Royal Mail Group plc, or which is related to the Post Office® business or any of its (potential)
customers, should be referred immediately to Post Office Ltd.

CONTACT WITH THE PUBLIC NEWS MEDIA

5.

Each of Royal Mail Group pic and Post Office Ltd has a duty to safeguard its own interests and
those of persons involved in Post Office® business in relation to material that is published in the
news media. The Public Relations Department of each of Royal Mail Group plc and Post Office Ltd
is primarily responsible for:

(i) deciding whether Royal Mail Group pic and Post Office Ltd should enter into public
correspondence, and

(ii) ensuring fair and accurate presentation of facts about Royal Mail Group pic and Post Office
Ltd and its services,

and no other person is entitled to comment publicly on such matters. In particular, untrue, ill-
informed or reckless comment will be challenged by Post Office Ltd (or Royal Mail Group plc, as the
case may be). While recognising the right of any individual to comment publicly on matters of
general interest, each of Royal Mail Group pic and Post Office Ltd expects Subpostmasters and

58
POL00000254
POL00000254

their Assistants who wish to comment publicly upon matters affecting any member of the Royal Mail
Group plc to exercise this right in a responsible manner. Subpostmasters must ensure, when
communicating with the press or offering comment which may be published, or broadcast on radio
or television, that their comments do not go beyond the accepted bounds of propriety and are not
likely to cause embarrassment or to mislead the public. Post Office Ltd should be asked for advice
in cases of doubt.

A Subpostmaster wishing to communicate with the public news media should be guided by the
following: -

(a) there must be no unauthorised disclosure of official information (see above);

(b) views and opinions expressed publicly must not bring Post Office Ltd or any other
Subpostmaster, Franchisee, Operator or Royal Mail Group plc or its employees into
disrepute; and

(c) a Subpostmaster offering unauthorised public comment must make it clear that he is
commenting in his private capacity and not on behalf of Post Office Ltd or Royal Mail
Group plc.

A Senior Representative (as defined in the national agreement on facilities for recognised unions)
may wish from time to time to represent the view of the National Federation of Sub-Postmasters,
particularly on matters affecting his Branch/Committee/Federation. In doing so he must indicate his
position as a Federation spokesman and give his own name.

Particular care is necessary when offering spontaneous comment to press or broadcasting
reporters or interviewers.

PUBLICATION OF OFFICIAL INFORMATION

No Subpostmaster may, without the permission of Post Office Ltd, use information derived from
Official records or experience for the purpose of publishing any document, book, play or article,
broadcasting on radio or television, producing or exhibiting a film or photographs, giving a talk or
lecture or taking part in a public discussion.

CORRESPONDENCE WITH THE PUBLIC

A Subpostmaster should not, without the permission of Post Office Ltd, write to or interview
members of the public on Post Office® matters other than for the purpose of correcting an error
committed at his own sub Post Office® branch.

OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

No Subpostmaster may, without permission, make an official document or a letter from the public,
or any other document which may come into his hands officially, the subject of legal proceedings.

USE OF OFFICIAL INFORMATION OR POSITION FOR PRIVATE PURPOSES

No Subpostmaster may use his position to further his private interests, or act in any way which
might give rise to the suspicion that he has used, for private purposes, information available to him
in his capacity as Subpostmaster.

BREACHES TO BE REPORTED

A Subpostmaster must report to Post Office Ltd any case in which there appears to have been a
breach of the above rules by anyone employed by him on Post Office® duties at the sub Post
Office® branch.

SECTION 17
SUBPOSTMASTERS' PRIVATE BUSINESS; BETTING AND GAMBLING; LICENSED PREMISES;

BORROWING AND LENDING MONEY; POLITICAL ACTIVITIES; CANVASSING FOR BUSINESS;
EMPLOYMENT IN ROYAL MAIL GROUP PLC OR CIVIL SERVICE.

1. PRIVATE BUSINESS.

14 The appointment of a Subpostmaster confers on the individual concerned the right to transact, and to
receive payment for, certain items of business on behalf of Post Office Ltd. The conditions of the
appointment also involve such non-compete restrictions on the private activities of the Subpostmaster on
the premises in which his Post Office® branch is situated as are fundamental and necessary to ensure the
continued viability of Post Office Ltd’s nationwide network.

1.2 It is important to the future of the Post Office® network that all Subpostmasters support Post Office®
products and services. A Subpostmaster who offers products or services in his private retail business on
the premises in which his Post Office® branch is situated which compete with Post Office® products and
services can reduce the revenue generated by the Post Office® branch. This revenue is essential to
provide a contribution to Post Office Ltd's fixed costs of maintaining the Post Office® network. Without this
contribution, Post Office Ltd might not be able to sustain the Post Office® network. It is therefore also in the
interests of all Subpostmasters to support this principle.

1.3 It is also in the interests of all Subpostmasters that Post Office Ltd is able to seek and negotiate business
opportunities for the whole Post Office® network and that it does not allow clients or suppliers to enter into
arrangements directly with selected Post Office® branches only to the disadvantage of the rest of the
network. This would adversely affect Post Office Ltd’s ability to maintain the Post Office® network as a
whole.

14 Subpostmasters benefit from being part of the Post Office® network. In addition to payments which
Subpostmasters receive from Post Office Ltd, Post Office Ltd invests in advertising that brings customers
into Post Office® branches, it ensures that Post Office® products meet regulatory requirements and it
provides customer and business services such as helplines to support Subpostmasters.

1.5 Accordingly, except as permitted by and in compliance with any waiver granted by Post Office Ltd in
accordance with paragraph 1.11 below, a Subpostmaster must not undertake in a private capacity, or allow
anyone else to undertake on the premises in which his Post Office® branch is situated, the types of
business listed in paragraph 1. 6 of this section 17, as amended by Post Office Ltd from time to time in
accordance with paragraph 1.8 below.

1.6 The non-compete restrictions on private business activities on the premises in which the Post Office®
branch is situated are as follows:

(i) business concerned with the provision of services relating to the collection, conveyance and/or
delivery of letters, parcels and packages (collectively called “Packets” in this paragraph) including
without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing: the sale of stamps, pre-paid postage labels and
stationery with prepaid postage; the acceptance, retention, sortation, return and redirection of
Packets (including Packets containing mail order or other home shopping goods and other
Packets); and the acceptance of payment for such services;

(ii) services for the payment of bills, the collection of payments (including pre-payments) or the
collection of revenue (whether by the sale of stamps or meter tokens, the charging of budget keys
or by other means) in connection with services for the supply of water, gas, fixed line telephones,
electricity, cable or satellite television, or local authority services;

(iii) the sale of National Lottery products;

(iv) Banking, Building, Industrial and Provident Society, Friendly Society or Credit Union business or
otherwise making available banking facilities including, without limitation, cheque-cashing, bureau

collecting deposits or providing withdrawal facilities on behalf of deposit-takers whether over-the-
counter or through an automated teller machine (ATM) or providing loans, credit cards or other
forms of credit or credit brokerage services but not including the provision of cash-back transactions
or the provision of basic saving stamp schemes which do not involve the return of cash to
participants in the scheme. For the avoidance of doubt, a cash-back transaction is the withdrawal
of cash via a debit card scheme, from the account associated with the card used, as part of a
transaction for the purchase of goods or services through the same scheme; and

(v) any financial services business or otherwise making available facilities which may compete with the
financial services activities carried on or to be carried on by Subpostmasters at any time for or on
behalf of Post Office Ltd or through Post Office® branches or which may compromise the regulatory
status of Post Office Ltd (including for this purpose, its Subpostmasters) in its role as appointed
representative of Post Office Ltd’s financial service product providers, including, for the avoidance
of doubt, the promotion of competing financial services but not including the provision of basic
savings stamps schemes which do not involve the return of cash to participants in the scheme.

For the avoidance of doubt, these non-compete restrictions apply to all methods of transaction of the areas

of business set out above. This includes, without limitation, the use of smartcards, ATMs and on-line

terminals.

The categories of business listed in paragraph 1.6 above constitute the current non-compete restrictions but

Post Office Ltd reserves the right to review these restrictions in the light of changing business requirements,

varying them if necessary. All Subpostmasters will be given at least 12 months’ notice in writing of any such

changes. No restrictions will be introduced on products or services other than Key Products and Services,

as defined in section 1.9 of this section 17.

Key Products and Services are the core products and services offered by Post Office Ltd. The Key
Products and Services are:

(i) Letters, parcels and packages services of any kind and related services;

(ii) Services for the payment of bills, collection of payment or collection of revenue;
(iii) National Lottery products;

(iv) Banking services, including bureau de change;

(v) Financial services;

(vi) National Savings and Investment products;

(vii) Money transfer services;

(x) Benefits’ distribution and Government services;

(xi) Motor vehicle and driver licensing services and other motorist services;

(xii) Telephony products and services;

(xiii) Travel ticketing and travel passes; and

and/or contribution for Post Office Ltd.

If a Subpostmaster is considering taking up a new private retail business opportunity which may fall within
the scope of the non-compete restrictions specified in paragraph 1.6 above, he should, before he takes up
any such business, inform Post Office Ltd of the circumstances and seek advice as to whether the work
concerned falls within the restrictions described above.

Subpostmasters may apply for a waiver from the non-compete restrictions in paragraph 1.6 of this section
17. Post Office Ltd's waiver policy is available on the Post Office Ltd website. This sets out the
circumstances in which a waiver may be granted and the procedures that must be followed. This policy is
subject to amendment by Post Office Ltd from time to time. If a waiver is granted subject to conditions, a
Subpostmaster must comply with these conditions. A failure to do so will result in the waiver being invalid
from the date the Subpostmaster ceased to comply with the conditions.

A Subpostmaster must not use and must ensure that no third party uses the name “Post Office” in
connection with any of his private business activities (or the private business activities of a company with
which he is associated in any way) or in such a way as to imply that Post Office Ltd is in any way connected
with these activities. Nor may a Subpostmaster transact any private business in a way that might lead
customers to conclude that Post Office Ltd is in any way connected with that business.

A Subpostmaster must not engage Royal Mail Group employees to undertake any work whatsoever
connected with the Subpostmaster’s private business (or the private business activities of a company with
which he is associated in any way) at any time when they are employed in Post Office® or Royal Mail
Group duties.

BETTING AND GAMBLING; LICENSED PREMISES; BORROWING AND LENDING MONEY
A Subpostmaster and his Assistants must not:

(i) bet or gamble by means of post (betting by private telephone off the Post Office® part of the
premises is permissible); or

(ii) take part in racing etc. pool or competitions or betting at “fixed odds” on football matches (there is
no objection to participation in ordinary football pool competition).

A Subpostmaster must not on the premises in which the Post Office® branch is situated;
(i) allow or provide for gambling; or
(ii) conduct any business with a turf commission agency or a football or turf pool agency.

Notwithstanding the conditions of Paragraphs 1.6(iii), 1.10 and 2.2 above, a Subpostmaster and his
Assistants may in a private capacity take part in or act as a promoter of such local lotteries as are permitted
under the Lotteries and Amusements Act 1976 (Northern Ireland in part Ill of the Betting and Lotteries Act
(Northern Ireland) 1957). The onus of ensuring that the law is complied with rests with the person
concerned in the promotion and conduct of the lottery and the sale of tickets. Tickets for such lotteries must
not be sold over the Post Office® branch counter nor must the Post Office® branch be used in any way for
advertising purposes, e.g. in giving addresses at which tickets are available, nor must advertisements.
include the words Post Office/Post Office®, Sub-Post Office/Sub-Post Office®, Post Office branch/Post
Office® branch or Subpostmaster.

A Post Office® branch may not be situated in premises for which an “on” licence allowing for the sale of
drinks, other than a restaurant, has been granted, unless the premises have been clearly divided so that
Post Office® customers do not need to go through the licensed premises. There is no objection to the
Subpostmaster holding an “off” licence provided the liquor is sold in closed vessels.

Neither a Subpostmaster nor any company with which he is associated in any way must borrow from or lend
money to any Royal Mail Group employee. Nor should a Subpostmaster or any such company provide
security for the benefit of any Royal Mail Group employee in raising a loan.

The loaning of money by a Subpostmaster or by any company with which he is associated in any way to

persons drawing pensions or allowances on the security or strength of their Post Office Card Accounts or of
expected future payments from the Department of Work and Pensions is also strictly forbidden.

POLITICAL ACTIVITIES

A Subpostmaster is free to take part in any national and local political activities subject to the following
conditions:-

(i) he must not engage in or allow his assistants to engage in political activities whilst engaged on Post
Office® business or on the Post Office® branch premises;

(ii) he must not exhibit any notice soliciting votes for any particular candidate or with any party or
political object either in the Post Office® branch or on any vehicle under the control of the Royal
Mail Group; and no leaflet or address with a party or political object may lie or be exhibited within
the Post Office® branch.

A Subpostmaster who intends to stand for Parliament must notify Post Office Ltd accordingly at the earliest
opportunity. He must cease to have connection with the running of the Post Office® branch from the day he
is nominated when the branch will be placed “in charge”. On receipt of the notification Post Office Ltd will
inform him of arrangements whereby he may name a deputy to act as Subpostmaster should he be elected.
If he is elected he will be able to resume office when he ceases to be a Member of Parliament, provided the
break in his service does not exceed 5 years and further provided he has complied with the arrangements.
for naming a deputy and the Post Office® branch has not been closed through normal changes during his
absence; should he fail to comply with these arrangements he will be regarded as having resigned on the
day he is elected. If he is not elected he may resume office after the election result has been declared.

CANVASSING FOR BUSINESS; EMPLOYMENT IN ROYAL MAIL GROUP PLC OR THE CIVIL SERVICE
A Subpostmaster must not canvass persons, firms or companies who reside or carry on business at a place
nearer to another Post Office® branch, to transact Post Office® business at his Post Office® branch. Nor

must he deliver items of Post Office® business to customers’ premises.

Neither a Subpostmaster nor any of his Assistants may be employed in Royal Mail Group plc or the Civil
Service if his duties would bring him into contact with the work of the Post Office® branch.

SECTION 18
NON-OBSERVANCE OF RULES: APPEALS PROCEDURE
ALLEGATIONS OF NON-COMPLIANCE OR NON-OBSERVANCE OF RULES
1. Although there may be instances where civil or criminal proceedings are contemplated in which it would

serve no useful purpose to call for a written explanation, in all other instances, and without prejudice to any
subsequent proceedings, any Subpostmaster will be afforded an opportunity of giving a written explanation
of allegations of non-compliance or non-observance of the rules which are made against him.

2. At the discretion of the Retail Network Manager which will not normally be withheld, the Subpostmaster
may, if he wishes, meet the Retail Network Manager to discuss the allegations. he may be accompanied by
a friend while doing so. The friend must be aged 18 or over and cannot be someone involved in the enquiry.
The friend must be a Subpostmaster, sub-office Assistant or Post Office employee - and can be the local
NFSP representative.

3. As repeated breaches of the rules, even if minor in themselves, may (subject to clause 10 of Section 1) lead
to the determination, without further warning or appeal, of the contract by means of the giving of three
months' notice, it is strongly recommended that Subpostmasters take the opportunity to make such written
and verbal explanations of their actions at the time of the alleged breach of rules. A record will be kept by
the Retail Network Manager of any such discussions and of any written warnings issued to the
Subpostmaster.

REPRESENTATIONS ON POST OFFICE MATTERS
4. Without prejudice to the above a Subpostmaster may address at any time the Regional General Manager

and representation he may wish to make having reference to his duties, remuneration or any other Post
Office matter. The decision of the Regional General Manager as to his response to such representations is

final.
APPEALS
5. If the Subpostmaster wishes to appeal against a decision to summarily terminate his contract for services,

he may do so either in writing or by personal interview and will be allowed ten (10) working days from the
date of the termination letter to make application, to a member of Post Office Limited “Appeals Authority”
whose decision will be final. There is no formal appeal against three months notice of contract termination
or against termination with pay in lieu of notice. Appeals on all other issues (e.g. recovery of losses caused
by the Subpostmasters negligence) are heard by the Regional General Manager whose decision is final.

APPROACHES TO PERSONS OUTSIDE EITHER POST OFFICE LIMITED OR ROYAL MAIL GROUP PLC

6. Until the Subpostmaster has exercised his final right of appeal, he should not ask persons outside either
Post Office Limited or Royal Mail Group pic to take up the case on his behalf although this does not prevent
a Subpostmaster from obtaining such advice and support from the NFSP or any other outside person as
may help him to present his case effectively. The Subpostmaster should not detain Post Office Limited
papers or allow them out of his custody for the purpose of such consultation without the permission of the
Retail Network Manager.

SECTION 19
OFFENCES: SUSPENSION: ENQUIRIES BY OFFICERS OF THE INVESTIGATION DIVISION
1. Dishonesty is viewed most seriously and any Subpostmaster or Post Office branch Assistant believed to

have carried, or taken part in, an act of dishonesty against Post Office Limited may be prosecuted.
Furthermore, any Subpostmaster so involved renders himself, subject to clause 10 of Section 1, liable to
summary termination of his contract. The case of an Assistant Post Office Limited may recommend to the
Subpostmaster that the Assistant should no longer remain in his employ on Post Office business.

ARRESTS AND CONVICTIONS

2. A Subpostmaster must report to his Regional General Manager if he is arrested and refused bail, or if he is
convicted by a Court of any criminal offence (except a traffic offence for which the penalty has not included
imprisonment).

IMMORALITY AND OTHER MATTERS OF PERSONAL CONDUCT

3. It is the aim and practice of Post Office Limited to maintain, to the maximum extent compatible with needs of
service to the public, an attitude of non-interference in the private lives of Subpostmasters. However, where
facts come to light calculated to cause public scandal or grave embarrassment to either Post Office Limited
or Royal Mail Group plc in connection with a Subpostmaster's private conduct, the question of his fitness for
retention in office may have to be considered.

SUSPENSION FROM OFFICE

4. A Subpostmaster may be suspended from office at any time if that course is considered desirable in the
legitimate interests of Post Office Limited in consequence of his: (a) being arrested, (b) having civil or
criminal proceedings brought or made against him, (c) where irregularities or misconduct at the office(s)
where he holds appointment(s) have been established to the satisfaction of Post Office Limited, or are
admitted, or are suspected and are being investigated, provided that Post Office Limited shall not suspend
the Subpostmaster:

44 arbitrarily, irrationally or capriciously;
42 without reasonable and proper cause; and/or

43 in circumstances where Post Office Limited is itself in material breach of duty in respect of the matters which
Post Office Limited considers give it the right to suspend.

5. Not used.
6. Not used.
CRIMINAL CONDUCT: REPORTING

7. If a Subpostmaster has knowledge or suspicion of dishonesty or other criminal conduct affecting either Post
Office Limited or Royal Mail Group pic on the part of any person including a Post Office branch Assistant or
an employee of either Post Office Limited or Royal Mail Group pic he must, if there is any apparent need for
immediate action, at once tell the Regional General Manager confidentially of his knowledge or suspicion.

INDUCEMENT TO ACT CONTRARY TO RULES

8. If any person should try to induce a Subpostmaster or a member of his staff to act contrary to the rules (if,
for example, he should be asked to datestamp covers irregularly with a view to either himself or the offender
afterwards enclosing therein betting slips or other communications relating to the result of some race, game
or sport) he should, while avoiding compliance (save in the case described in paragraph 7, also avoid
putting that person upon his guard by definite refusal). The Subpostmaster should as soon as possible tell
the Regional General Manager what has happened giving a full report and description of the person so that
an immediate report can be made to POID and instructions sought.

70
POL00000254
POL00000254

A Subpostmaster or Post Office branch Assistant who is asked irregularly to put in course of post for
despatch or delivery from his own office a cover already date-stamped, addressed to a betting agent, and
presumably already containing a betting slip or other communication respecting the result of some race,
game or sport, should accept it and with it any bribe offered for compliance. He should at once initial the
cover and hand it and the bribe to the Regional General Manager, to whom he should report as provided in
the last sentence of paragraph 8.

THEFTS BY STRANGERS

10.

A Subpostmaster or Post Office branch Assistant who sees a theft of property of either Post Office Limited
or Royal Mail Group plc committed by a stranger should inform the Police of the facts and then report the
matter to his Regional General Manager as soon as possible.

FAILURE TO REPORT DISHONESTY

11.

In line with any employee of either Post Office Limited or Royal Mail Group plc a Subpostmaster or Post
Office branch Assistant is expected to report immediately any suspicion of dishonesty or criminal intent
which may in any way affect either Post Office Limited or Royal Mail Group plc, whether the likely offender
be connected with either Post Office Limited or Royal Mail Group plc or not. He is similarly enjoined to
render all possible assistance to officers of the Investigation Division (see below).

ENQUIRIES BY OFFICERS OF THE POST OFFICE INVESTIGATION DIVISION

12.

13.

14.

15.

The main job of the Investigation Division is to investigate, or help the Police to investigate, criminal
offences against the Post Office, British Telecommunications and the Department of National Savings. the
Investigation Division does NOT enquire into matters where crime is not suspected.

Most of the crimes dealt with by the Investigation Division are committed by outsiders. If follows that a
common reason for Investigation Division officers seeking interviews with persons employed on Post Office
business is to get help in clearing up such offences. Usually the help takes the form of a witness statement
that provides evidence about a particular act or acts that the witness has carried out in the course of his or
her duty.

Although they comprise the minority of all Investigation Division crime investigations, there are many cases
where the possibility (or even direct suspicion) arises that persons employed on Post Office business may
be involved. Officers of the Investigation Division conduct interviews about these suspected offences and
they are required to observe the same code of conduct when obtaining evidence as that laid down for Police
Officers. This provides for an officer investigating a criminal offence to question any person, whether
suspected or not, from whom he thinks that useful information may be obtained. As soon as the
Investigation Division officer has evidence which would afford reasonable ground for suspecting that a
person has committed an offence, he must caution him before asking any questions about that offence. The
caution must be in terms which make it clear that the suspected person is not obliged to say anything
unless he wishes to do so and that what he says will be put into writing and given in evidence.

If a Subpostmaster or Post Office branch Assistant is questioned as a suspected person by an officer of the
Investigation Division, on statements made by a third person, and expresses a desire to be confronted by
that person, such confrontation will, if practicable, be arranged. At the confrontation, the suspect will be at
liberty to question the third person on his evidence and the questions and replies will be recorded by the
Investigation Division officer.

FRIENDS AT INVESTIGATION INTERVIEWS

16.

17.

At all interviews between Investigation Division Officers and a Subpostmaster or Post Office branch
Assistant, the interviewing officer will first introduce himself, explain the nature of the enquiry, the ask the
person to be interviewed if he wishes to have a friend present. The introduction and explanation are
necessary first steps so the person to be interviewed knows what is involved when he makes his free
personal choice whether to ask for a friend to be present at the interview or not.

A friend invited to attend an Investigation Division interview must be aged 18 or over and cannot be
someone involved in the inquiry. The friend must be a Subpostmaster, Post Office branch Assistant or
employee of either Post Office Limited or Royal Mail Group plc - and can be the local NFSP representative.
To avoid unreasonable delay and to ensure that interviews will not commence until a friend, if requested, is

71
18.

19.

POL00000254
POL00000254

present, the person being interviewed will be asked to nominate alternative friends if the one first (or
subsequently) chosen is not available or may be involved in the enquiry.

If a person being interviewed declines to have a friend present when asked but changes his mind later, he
may ask for a friend to be called at that stage. If he is not questioned as a suspected person at the outset
(i.e. not under caution), but fresh evidence emerges during the interview which gives reasonable grounds
for suspicion, the Investigation Division officer will make this clear and explain that he proposes to continue
his questions after caution. Before the caution is given the Investigation Division officer will ask if the
presence of a friend is desired during the remainder of the interview.

A friend may only attend and listen to questions and answers. He must not interrupt in any way, either by
word or signal; if he does interrupt he will be required to leave at once and the interview will proceed without
him. Whatever is said at the interview is to be treated as in strictest confidence. The friend may take notes
of the interview but he must keep the notes in the strictest confidence. The only communication the friend is
entitled to make on behalf of the person who has been questioned will be in the form of a written “in strictest
confidence" statement which may be submitted by the latter, in support of any official appeal which the
person questioned may desire to make in connection with the methods followed at the enquiry. No other
communication about the interview is allowed (unless made by permission of the Post Office) as it might
constitute a breach of the Official Secrets Acts. The questioned officer may, however, if he so desires,
communicate the friend's statement to the National Federation of Sub-Postmasters in strictest confidence.

SEARCHES

20.

21.

If a person agrees to his property or house being searched by Investigation Division staff the Investigation
Division officer will ask, before the search is carried out, if he wishes to have a friend present.

Investigation Division officers have no authority to search a Subpostmaster or Post Office branch Assistant
or their homes unless the have first obtained the agreement of the person concerned or they have obtained
a warrant to do so. In practice Investigation Division officers only seek authority or permission to search
when it is deemed absolutely necessary or in the interests of the person involved (e.g. as a pointer to their
innocence). If search by consent is carried out during the course of enquiries which do not substantiate any
suspicion that may have been directed at a Subpostmaster or Post Office branch Assistant, he will be
handed at a later stage a written apology for any inconvenience caused, coupled with a statement that he
readily agreed to the search and that nothing which would cast any doubt on his honesty was found.

SECTION 20

INFECTIOUS (INCLUDING CONTAGIOUS) DISEASES

1.

Subpostmasters, are expected to act on the advice given by their general practitioners or hospital
specialists, and to refrain from providing "Personal Service", by taking leave of absence, through sickness if
advised to do so. This is both for their own good and that of others.

Contact with a person suffering from such a disease will only rarely exempt a Subpostmaster from providing
Post Office services, nevertheless the advice in Par. 1 may apply if the medical practitioner so advises.

“Open cases" of Pulmonary tuberculosis must receive clearance from Post Office Limited, before a
Subpostmaster will be allowed to resume the provision of "Personal Service".

If the local Public Health Department should require the temporary closing of the office, the Regional
General Manager will issue instructions as to the stock, etc. In such cases the question of continuing
payment of the subpostmaster’s emoluments subject to a deduction in respect of any saving in expenses,
will be considered on its merits.

These conditions apply equally to any assistants employed by a subpostmaster on Post Office duties. Also,
in such cases the question of meeting any loss sustained by the Subpostmaster or Post Office branch
Assistant in consequence of the latters enforced absence will be considered on its merits. It should,
however, be understood that the object of any payment that may be made by Post Office Limited in these
cases is to prevent there being any inducement to the Post Office branch Assistant to come on duty when
his presence would be a source of danger to the public or the Post Office employees with whom they might
come in contact in his Post Office work. Post Office recognises no other obligation in the matter.

TELEPHONE FACILITIES AT SUB POST OFFICES

THE OFFICIAL BRANCH TELEPHONE LINE

1.

A Subpostmaster must arrange for the provision of suitable telephone facilities at his Post Office® branch to
meet the needs of the official business of Post Office Ltd and the requirements of security. These
telephone facilities are known as the “Official Branch Telephone Line”.

Where possible, the Official Branch Telephone Line must be provided by a telecommunications provider of
Post Office Ltd 's choice in order that Post Office Ltd may use the line for the Post Office Ltd Asymmetric
Digital Subscriber Line [ADSL] service.

The Horizon equipment ("Horizon" being as defined in Section 12), or any future replacement for the
Horizon equipment, or any official Post Office Ltd equipment as Post Office Ltd may from time to time
specify will be connected to the Master Line Box at the Post Office® branch and will utilise the Post Office
Ltd ADSL service that runs over the Official Branch Telephone Line.

Post Office Ltd is under no obligation to provide an Official Branch Telephone Line that can be used for any
purposes other than official Post Office Ltd purposes. If the Official Branch Telephone Line is capable of any
private use, the Subpostmaster must use the Official Branch Telephone Line solely for official Post Office
Ltd purposes and must not utilise it for any private purposes, except as provided for in 9.3 below.

Any movement of or changes to any of the telephone or other communications equipment at the Post
Office® branch that are the result of changes initiated by the Subpostmaster, including but not limited to
refurbishment or re-location of the branch, will be the responsibility of the Subpostmaster. The
Subpostmaster will be responsible for ordering and paying for the movement or changes from the
telecommunication service provider.

Post Office Ltd reserves the right to amend and update the requirements of this section in the future should
the operational and security needs of Post Office Ltd require such a change.

The Subpostmaster agrees to co-operate with Post Office Ltd in relation to the installation at the Post
Office® branch of any other forms of communications equipment or data links to be used for the purposes
of conducting the official business of Post Office Ltd.

PROVISION OF THE OFFICIAL BRANCH TELEPHONE LINE

8.

9.

The Subpostmaster must provide:
(i) a direct exchange line; or

(ii) an extension plan installation comprising a portable telephone and two sockets: one to be installed
in the Post Office® branch and the other in the Subpostmaster’s bedroom. (This type of installation
is only required where Post Office Ltd considers it is desirable, as a security measure, and where
the Subpostmaster resides on the premises. However, Post Office Ltd will not require this type of
system to be installed at island and small rural offices where Post Office Ltd considers that the risk
of criminal attack is clearly negligible).

The Subpostmaster’s requirement to provide the Official Branch Telephone Line may be discharged in the
following ways:

9.1 An Official Branch Telephone Line provided by a telecommunications provider of Post Office Ltd's
choice meets the requirements of the Post Office Ltd ADSL service. It is the simplest and preferred
option. A Subpostmaster making use of an Official Branch Telephone Line provided by a
telecommunications provider of Post Office Ltd's choice may not opt to provide the Official Branch
Telephone Line by way of the arrangements described in 9.2 and 9.3.

74
POL00000254
POL00000254

As of the date of transfer of Official Branch Lines under control of Post Office Ltd to anew
telecommunication services provider it shall be possible to use Official Branch Telephone Lines
provided by a telecommunications provider of Post Office Ltd’s choice for official and private calls.

From a date that will be communicated by Post Office Ltd, it will no longer be possible to use the
Official Branch Telephone Line for private calls. This date is anticipated to be in February 2018.

Post Office Ltd shall remain responsible for the line rental and for the cost of official calls made by the
Subpostmaster.

New Subpostmasters who take up appointment at Post Office® branches where a previous
Subpostmaster did not transfer responsibility for and ownership of the Official Branch Telephone Line
to Post Office Ltd may either transfer their lines to Post Office Ltd and use the lines for official calls
only, or continue with existing arrangements where Post Office Ltd is invoiced for official calls while
the Subpostmaster pays the provider of the telecommunication services for line rental, official, and
private calls, as provided for in 9.3 in the event that Post Office Ltd is unable to offer either option 9.1
or option 9.2.

9.2 By allowing the installation by Post Office Ltd at the Post Office ®branch of a separate telephone line
from a telecommunications provider of Post Office Ltd‘ s choice to be used as the Official Branch
Telephone Line. The Subpostmaster may retain whatever private lines and /or telecommunications
facilities he or she wishes, but those facilities shall not be used for official purposes. Post Office Ltd
will pay the telecommunications provider of the Official Branch Telephone Line directly for the use of
this line. The Subpostmaster will incur no telephone costs for the provision of the Official Branch
Telephone Line and therefore has no need to reclaim any such costs from Post Office Ltd.

9.3 By the provision of the Official Branch Telephone Line via any telecommunications service provider in
circumstances where the Subpostmaster retains responsibility for and ownership of the line. In such
circumstances, the Subpostmaster is billed directly by the service provider for all costs associated
with the line and is entitled to reclaim from Post Office Ltd the ‘official’ element of those costs. If the
telephone facilities provided under this option do not meet the specifications required by the Post
Office Ltd ADSL service the facilities will not be acceptable as the Official Branch Telephone Line. In
such circumstances the Subpostmaster must agree to transfer to either option 9.1 or option 9.2,
unless Post Office Ltd is unable to offer either of those options, in which case the existing
arrangements would continue.

New Subpostmasters who take up appointment at Post Office® branches where a previous
Subpostmaster adopted the option in 9.3 are required as a condition of their appointment to change
to option 9.1 if possible, or option 9.2 if option 9.1 cannot be achieved upon appointment unless Post
Office Ltd is unable to offer either of those options, in which case they may maintain the arrangement
provided for in 9.3.

TELEPHONE COSTS REIMBURSEMENT

10. The following applies only to those Subpostmasters who provide the Official Branch Telephone Line in
accordance with option 9.3 above.

RENTAL CHARGES

11. Post Office Ltd, on production of a paid quarterly telephone account, will reimburse the Subpostmaster the
reasonable rental charges billed by the provider of the Official Branch Telephone Line including the VAT
element (see paragraph 16) appropriate to the type of telephone facility that Post Office Ltd has agreed is
necessary. Rental charges which exceed the levels so authorised by Post Office Ltd remain the
responsibility of the Subpostmaster.

CALL UNIT ALLOWANCE
12. Each Subpostmaster is given for each telephone account period an allowance of call units for official
purposes, based on the scale of Post Office® business transacted; any part of the allowance not expended

in a telephone account period cannot be carried over to the next. The Subpostmaster is due to pay for all
call units used in excess of this allowance.

75

SECTION 22

QUALITY STANDARDS

1.

Post Office Limited, through its network of post offices, aims to give customers and clients a high quality
service. The Subpostmaster must therefore give high priority to serving customers quickly and efficiently,
and to fulfilling the documentation requirements of clients with accuracy and professionalism. Also the
Subpostmaster will participate in “Putting the Customer First" by attending the training sessions which form
the programme and carrying out the interim activity required between sessions.

The interim activity consist of commitment to display the Customer Charter in the public area of the Post
Office branch, and to hand out questionnaires inviting customer feedback. On an ongoing basis
questionnaires will be handed out at regular intervals, to be determined by Post Office Limited, but not more
than once every six months. In addition to the issue of questionnaires Subpostmasters, particularly those in
larger Post Office branches, will be encouraged to measure customer service as described below.
Subpostmaster's Post Office branch assistants are also expected to undergo the "Putting the Customer
First" programme, either at sessions led by the Subpostmasters themselves, once they are trained, or the
retail network manager. Subpostmasters should make all reasonable efforts to encourage their staff to
participate in the training.

Payment for attendance at the four "off site" sessions, led by retail network managers, within the "Putting
the Customer First" programme, will be for travel and substitution.

WAITING TIME

2.

The Subpostmaster should ensure that the time for which customers wait to be served is kept to the
minimum, and make any adjustments to the staffing pattern accordingly. To help achieve this objective
Subpostmasters in offices displaying the charter, particularly those in larger offices, will be encouraged to
monitor waiting times using the system developed by Post Office Limited.

This entails counting the number of customers queuing and the number of clerks serving, three times a day
and to supply the information to Post Office Limited to enable the results to be analysed and fed back to the
Subpostmaster.

While Post Office Limited has an overall national objective for customers to wait for no longer than five
minutes before being served, it is recognised that customers have different needs and expectations of
waiting time in different offices, and at different times of the day or week. However, Regional General
Managers will treat very seriously any evidence which suggests that the Subpostmaster is not making all
reasonable efforts to ensure that customer waiting time is minimised, to meet the needs of customers
locally.

TRANSACTIONS

3.

The Subpostmaster will be responsible for ensuring that transactions are carried out accurately, that all
reasonable steps are taken to prevent fraud and that all documentation is properly completed and
despatched at the due time. Where under the terms of its contracts with its clients Post Office Limited incurs
financial penalties as a result of the Subpostmaster's failure in this regard, Post Office Limited may, subject
to clauses 12 and 13A of Section 12, pass on this additional cost to the Subpostmaster. The Appendix to
this Section sets out the current maxima of the penalties which can be passed on to the Subpostmaster. In
such circumstances, Post Office Limited will furnish copies of the appropriate documents as evidence in
support of any action. Failure to properly complete accounting and traffic information documents may lead
to the exclusion in whole or in part of business transacted for the purposes of determining payment.

The Subpostmaster will ensure that customers are treated fairly, courteously and helpfully. Persistent failure

to meet the high standard of service demanded by Post Office Limited could, subject to clause 10 of Section
1, result in termination of contract.

SECTION 23

REDEMPTION OF TELEPHONE, TELEVISION, MOTOR VEHICLE AND OTHER SAVINGS STAMPS

(i)

(ii)

(ili)

(iv)

A Subpostmaster must only accept savings stamps either in total or part payment for the relevant
transaction to which they refer except in the case of Post Office® saving stamps which may be accepted for
all Post Office® goods and services, and any other goods and services that the Subpostmaster has, at
his/her own discretion, decided to allow.

It is TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE for a Subpostmaster (or anybody acting on his behalf) to:-

exchange redeemed savings stamps for cash except in the case of Post Office® saving stamps and only
then where the Subpostmaster is paying change for a purchase made using the Post Office® saving stamps
and the amount of such change is under £5.00;

affix savings stamps to savings cards and claim them as if they had been redeemed by a customer in the
normal course;

convert total of partial cash or cheque payments for licence or accounts payments into stamps and claim
them as if they had been presented by a customer;

convert official cash (whether directly from the till or paid in over the counter) into savings stamps (whether
affixed to a card or not) for use as a means of saving for any purpose whatsoever; or to take action which
improperly sets out to increase his remuneration.

Redeemed savings stamps must be despatched immediately following completion of the cash account on
which the transaction to which they refer takes place. It is not acceptable to remit redeemed savings stamps
later than the scheduled despatch date or to remit several weeks redemption together.

In the event that cases of falsification come to light Post Office Limited will view such activities extremely
seriously and in such circumstances almost certainly (subject to clause 10 of Section 1) consider
termination of the Subpostmasters Contract for services.
