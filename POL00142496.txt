P10001163

Problem Title: Missing & incorrect reference data on Remedy and SPICE

Problem Description: Reference data is filed each Friday by Matt Warren in a central location, which
can be accessed & retrieved by Prism Alliance (contact Caroline Cockman) to update Remedy (batch
interface). Recent examples indicate there is a breakdown in this process.

Current Position:
Conference call held to discuss CS concerns over the source data held within POL ref data.

Raised a defect with the new SPICE solution in relation to its inability to ignore ceased counter services
e.g postal MVL's.

All other concerns removed e.g core service information has never been held on ref data

P10001247

Problem Title: DCS Transactions Resulting in Bad Format Response

Problem Description: Large number of 'bad format’ responses coming from Streamline in relation to
DC service. Results in declined transaction

Current Position:

Meeting held between Bob Booth and Streamline technical people

Root cause established and confirmed- split requests within X.25 packets is not allowed.
Change is required, preferably for Fujitsu to stop 'stuffing' packets.

Despite POL 'strong' claims for the change to be made for free, Fujitsu PM ( Tony Wicks ) not in
agreement that Fujitsu are doing anything wrong ( believes that FS have delivered as per Tech Spec)
and that Streamline should have informed Fujitsu at the beginning that single requests required single
packets.

Next Steps:
Escalate to Beth Newton, suggesting that POL request a feasability study is done by Fujitsu prior to
POL considering making a commercial change request.

2. PRODUCT RELATED PROBLEMS

P10001271 ay

Problem Title: Returning Powergen Electricity tokens to the NSSC

Problem Description: The Powergen tokens were withdrawn from sale on 31/03/04. Branches were
instructed to return the stock to NSSC on their next scheduled rem. On 05/05/04 the tokens were
removed from the Horizon pick list which means that branches are unable to rem them out.

Current Position: An ATP has been created to enable branches to return any remaining Powergen
tokens to the NSSC, and this has been posted to the NBSC Bulletin board. All branches with open calls
on the NBSC will be called back and advised of the new procedure.

Problem Title: Marine Drive 213337 - Somr Suspended

Problem Description: The branch had been operating effectively without any concern since the Spmr
took over in July 2003. In January 04 the subpostmaster had a loss of £1100 and applied for hardship to
repay the money.

Current Position:

The subpostmaster has been in post since July 2003 and the balance record has been fine until January
2004.

In WK 39 there was a loss of £1100 - the subpostmaster applied for hardship to repay the loss.

From WK 43 to 51, the branch losses have accumulated to £25,700.

The subpostmaster employed some new staff before the losses began. Since being suspended on 23
March and removing the subpostmaster & incumbent staff, 2 separate reliefs have run the branch and
there have been no losses.

The subpostmaster is adamant the system is to blame.
