8 Incident Management

Incident Management provides a controlled environment for the resolution of
day to day events that interrupt normal operation of the systems, services and
procedures within the live operational environment. Incident Management
also provides:

a) triggers for problem management;

b) triggers for the application of business continuity plans;
c) onward routing of unresolved complaints;

d) service data for reports.

A large part of incident management is subcontracted to ISD. The exceptions
are third line software support, which is handled by the ICL Pathway CS System
Support Centre (SSC) and the handling of business incidents, which is managed
by the ICL Pathway CS Management Support Unit (MSU).

Incident

An incident is an individual day to day event, within the live environment,
which is reported to the ICL Pathway single-point-of-contact, i.e. the HSH.
Incidents may also be reported to the PON single-point-of-contact, i.e. the
NBSC. Incidents may be transferred between the HSH and the NBSC.

Where there is any chance of confusion, incidents are more tightly defined as
“live incidents”.

To avoid confusion, “incidents” that occur in the pre-live environment are
always referred to as “pre-live incidents”.

The main incident types include:

a) requests for advice and guidance;

b) reported faults or failures in equipment, software, services or procedures;
c) reported user errors;

d) reported complaints;

e) situations which need to be recorded for audit trail purposes.

Temporary procedure (TP

A TP describes the actions to be taken when specified types of incident are
encountered. TPs are developed by the appropriate expert domain within
Incident Management and are recorded on a Known Error Log.

HSH will normally refer the caller to the NBSC, i.e. ask them to dial the
NBSC number. By exception, if the caller states that they have already been
referred to the HSH by the NBSC, the HSH will accept the call, raise an
incident and communicate the incident to the NBSC.

8.3 Linking incidents passed between dlesky

Policy

a) If the HSH wishes to transfer an incident to the NBSC, the HSH will retain
ownership of the incident until the NBSC accepts the incident.

b) If the NBSC accepts the incident, the HSH will cross-refer their incident to
the NBSC incident and then close the HSH incident.

c) If the NBSC does not accept the incident, the HSH will retain ownership of
the incident and escalate the situation within the their line management for
resolution.

the control and co-ordination of the efforts required to resolve the incident.

b) Incident resolution will be progressed in accordance with agreed target
resolution times.

c) The HSH will either resolve the incident themselves or route the incident to
the appropriate expert domain. The incident record will be updated each
time there is a change of status, e.g. network tested and found to be OK,
incident routed to third line support.

d) Resolution will follow defined support procedures, which will normally
result in the system being returned to normal operation within the agreed
target resolution time. By exception Temporary Procedures may by applied
while a fix is developed.

8.5 Development of Temporary Procedurey

Policy

a) In exceptional situations expert domains may develop TPs to contain
incidents while a fix is developed. TPs will be recorded on a Known Error
Log.

b) TPs must be authorised if they impact Horizon business processes, at which
point they become Authorised Temporary Procedures (ATPs).
Authorisation is performed under the control of Problem Management.

8.6 Incident closure

Policy

a) Individual incidents that relate to technical or system errors will be closed
when the service has been returned to normal operation, either by resolving
the incident or applying a TP. Closure will be agreed with the originator of
the incident.

b) Incidents that are “offered” to the PON NBSC will be closed when the NBSC
accepts responsibility for incident resolution.

c) “Master incidents” that record the need for a fix will remain open until
notification of successful release of the fix has been received.

d) “Master incidents” that relate to a problem will remain open until the
problem is resolved.

9 Problem Management

Problem Management provides a controlled environment for the resolution of
problems that arise within the live operational environment.

Problem

Problem is the term used for an adverse situation that is: (a) caused by a defect
in the specification, design, production, implementation or use of any of the
service components and (b) substantial enough to warrant action to eradicate
it. A problem may be indicated by a trend of incidents. Problems are deemed
to exist when they are recorded on the ICL Pathway CS or PON Problem
Management Databases.

Authorised Temporary procedure (ATP)

An ATP is a TP that has an impact on the Horizon business processes and
requires authorisation by PON before it is used within the live environment.

9.1 Houry of operation (progressing problem resolution)

Policy
g.00am to 5.00pm Monday to Friday.

9.2 Logging problemy

Policy

a) ICL Pathway CS will develop and maintain procedures to control the receipt
of problem notifications from HSH, from within ICL Pathway CS and in the
case of cross-domain problems (problems that involve both ICL Pathway CS
and PON organisations), problem notifications from PON Problem
Managers.

b) Problem notifications will result in a problem being raised, the assignment
of an unique reference number and the logging of the problem on the ICL
Pathway CS Problem Management database.

c) Cross-domain problems, i.e. problems that require the involvement of both
ICL Pathway CS and PON, will be logged on both the ICL Pathway CS and
PON Problem Management databases. The ICL Pathway CS and PON
problem references will be cross-referred.

d) All problems reported by PON will be recorded on the ICL Pathway CS
Problem Management database, irrespective of any initial judgement
relating to ICL Pathway’s required involvement.

10 Business Continuity Management

Business continuity has two main components. The first is business continuity
planning, which involves the proactive identification of things that can go
wrong with the end-to-end services, developing appropriate business continuity
plans and testing that the plans work in practice.

The second component involves the application of the business continuity
plans when the end-to-end service is interrupted.

Business Continuity Plans

Business continuity plans detail the actions to be taken when the end-to-end
service is interrupted.

Major Business Continuity Incident (MBCI)

MBCIs are a special type of incident, which are raised in response to the
reporting to the HSH of a major failure or disruption in the end-to-end service.
MBCIs are routed to the ICL Pathway CS Business Continuity Manager and act
as a trigger for the application of pre-defined business continuity plans.
