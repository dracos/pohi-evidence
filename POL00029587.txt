Paula Here are my speaking notes for your call with Alice this afternoon

e Ihave a call with James on the 23" May, next Thursday at 10.30, when we will discuss how he wants the
investigation to continue, including the 2 MP cases he has asked 2" Sight to focus and the spot reviews.

e However some instances are coming to light where there is evidence that there are bugs in Horizon, which I am
being told is normal in any large computer system. But I am still being assured that the system’s integrity is not
in doubt

e Lesley is meeting Fujitsu tomorrow morning to go through the technical assurance that the supbpostmaster’s
trading statement cannot be changed without their knowledge

e  Alwen is meeting with them on Monday to look at with a layman’s eyes and understand what it might have
looked like for a subpostmaster using the system

e The Good News is that where we have found to bugs since HNGX (new Horizon) they have been detected and
put right with no loss for the subpostmaster, and Fujitsu now monitor the suspense account for any such
problems.

e  Alwen will specifically ask on Monday if anything else could be happening we do not know about eg too small to
register at the office, and Old Horizon bugs

e This is not good Alice, but from what we have seen so far our response to bugs has been effective

e [have asked for some time in our diaries next week to talk through our approach, and would welcome you
counsel before the James meeting
