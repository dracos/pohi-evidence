If | discovered a discrepancy | would make the postmaster or manger aware
of our findings and check as to whether there was any other cash or stock not
been accounted for before informing the Contracts Manager. If the
discrepancy was small we would ask the postmaster to ensure the
discrepancy is made good by the completion of their next balance period. |
always gave the postmaster an opportunity to check all our figures to ensure
they agreed with our result and findings. | would explain the purpose of our
visit prior to commencement and keep them updated as the audit progressed.

Audit of the West Byfleet branch

20. | was requested to attend an audit at West Byfleet on 14 January 2008. |
believe this was a routine audit as far as | can remember. | had never had
any communication with Mrs Misra prior to this audit. | recalled that the
purpose of the audit was to verify financial assets due to the Post Office and
confirm compliance procedures and regulatory requirements were adhered
to. | was assisted by two colleagues Sue Le May, Field Support Advisor and
Chris Stevens, Field Support Team Leader. When Mrs. Misra arrived at the
branch at approx. 10.45 am she immediately asked to speak to me and made
me aware the branch would be short by between £50k and £60k. During our
discussion Mrs. Misra explained a member of staff had taken £89k and she
did not report this as she was worried the branch would be closed. | am
unaware if anyone from the Post Office had informed Mrs Misra that if she
was out by a certain amount her branch would be closed. | reported the
shortage to Paul Dawkins, Investigation Team Manager and Tony Hills,
Network Compliance Audit manager. | cannot recall whose decision it was to
suspend Mrs. Misra. | also cannot recall if | asked Mrs Misra to prepare a
hand written note to explain the discrepancy. During the audit | obtained from
Horizon print outs that included an Office snapshot, Balance snapshots from
each stock unit, Suspense Account Report, previous Branch Trading
Statement, Remittances In and Out figures for this Trading Period. On
completion of the audit | reported the findings of the audit, in my report to

evidence.

21. | have been. asked to consider my memo to Ms Elaine Ridge at

[POL00049500]. | recalled that this was the findings of the audit.

Criminal proceedings

22. | was not surprised by the outcome of the trial. Regarding the challenge of
the integrity of the Horizon | cannot comment as | do not know the workings

of the system and was never made aware of such issues.

23. | have been asked to consider the Judgment of the Court of Appeal in
Josephine Hamilton & Others v Post Office Limited [2021] EWCA Crim 577
at [POL00113278], in particular at paragraphs 198 to 209 on Mrs Misra’s

case.
