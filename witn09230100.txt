I, Keith Noverre, will say as follows:-



rn rr..rrrtr


 1     I am a former employee of Post Office Ltd and held the position of Auditor

       between September 2003 and October 2016.



  2,   This witness statement is made to assist the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry

       (the `'Inquiry") with the matters set out in the Rule 9 Request dated 17 August

       2023 (the "Request"). The focus of this statement is my position as a Branch

       Auditor at the Post Office and the prosecution of Mrs Seema Misra.



  Background


  3,   My Post Office career was as follows:

           i) September 1986 — May 1992 Counter Clerk.

           ii) May 1992 — October 1997 — Cash Centre (Watford and Hemel


                                     Page 1 of 11
                                                                                       WITNO9230100
                                                                                     WITNO9230100




             Hempstead) — numerous roles.

         iii) October 1997 — September 2003 — Cash management team (St

             Albans and London).

         iv) September 2003 — August 2008 — Auditor.

         v) August 2008 — October 2016 — Auditor / Trainer (Field support team).



     The above dates are approximate dates as I cannot remember exactly when

     changed roles. I remained an Auditor until I left the Post Office in October

     2016.



4.   As to qualifications I had no qualifications relevant to the audit role. I was

     given full on the job training to ensure I carried out my role to a high level and

     in a professional manner. The role was to visit a branch and verify financial

     assets due to the Post Office was being accounted for accurately and

     compliance matters were adhered to in branch as per guidelines. My line

      manager was Mr. Warren Hattrell. All my colleagues were professional and

     competent in carrying out our role. I just reported our findings to the Contract

     Manager and if applicable Investigations Team. I do not know how many

     audits I attended. The process was to ensure branch was in compliance with

     their financial declarations and to ensure procedures were followed.



The audit process and the policies/practices in place



5,   1 have been asked to provide an account of my role and the policies and

      practices in place in relation to the audit process. I have no recollection of the

                                                                                 WITNO9230100




     policies and practices.




6.   1 have been asked to describe the process by which auditors were recruited.

     I have no recollection of the recruitment and training of auditors.



7.   1 have been asked to consider the documents:

        i)      "Assurance Review - Recruitment (Vetting & Training)" (version

                1.0, 27 October 2009) [POL00032698];

        ii)     "Network auditing approach, methods and assurance" (2013)

                [POL00086765];

        iii)    "Training & Audit Advisor" (undated) [POL00088453];

        iv)     "Audit Advisor" (undated) [POL00088557].



8.   I have no recollection of the any of the above.



9.   I recalled that auditors were recruited internally, and I am not aware of the

     process. As I was not involved in this process I am not aware of what

     qualifications were required. Training was mainly based in branch but I

     believe induction training was given. I personally had sufficient training to

     carry out my role.

    administrated by the administration team.



12. 1 have been asked to consider document `'Audit Plan & Scheduling, Chapter




13. The scheduling of audits was completed by the administration team. It was

    my understanding that they prepared a weekly audit schedule giving priority

    to special audit requests.

15. If I discovered a discrepancy I would make the postmaster or manger aware

    of our findings and check as to whether there was any other cash or stock not

    been accounted for before informing the Contracts Manager. If the

    discrepancy was small we would ask the postmaster to ensure the

    discrepancy is made good by the completion of their next balance period. I

    always gave the postmaster an opportunity to check all our figures to ensure

    they agreed with our result and findings. I would explain the purpose of our

    visit prior to commencement and keep them updated as the audit progressed.

     I always explained if they had any questions or concerns during the audit they

     could let me know. If access to the Horizon system was unavailable, as far

     as I can remember, we would not be able to complete an audit as we would

     have no details of what the branch should have on hand.

            i)    "Audit Trail Functional Specification" (version 8.0, 18

     information I could access that a postmaster could not have on Horizon. I

     cannot recall what an Audit Global User account was.-




19. I have been asked to consider documents:

     i)          my audit report (dated 16 January 2008) in respect of the audit

                 conducted on 14 January 2008 of the West Byfleet (Branch Code

     iii)        the investigation/legal report at [POL00044589],

                 statement from pages 3 to 6) at [P0L00058438].

                                                                                   WITNO9230100




20. 1 was requested to attend an audit at West Byfleet on 14 January 2008. I

    believe this was a routine audit as far as I can remember. I had never had

    any communication with Mrs Misra prior to this audit. I recalled that the

    purpose of the audit was to verify financial assets due to the Post Office and

    confirm compliance procedures and regulatory requirements were adhered

    to. I was assisted by two colleagues Sue Le May, Field Support Advisor and

    Chris Stevens, Field Support Team Leader. When Mrs. Misra arrived at the

    branch at approx. 10.45 am she immediately asked to speak to me and made

    me aware the branch would be short by between £50k and £60k. During our

    discussion Mrs. Misra explained a member of staff had taken £89k and she

    did not report this as she was worried the branch would be closed. I am

    unaware if anyone from the Post Office had informed Mrs Misra that if she

    was out by a certain amount her branch would be closed. I reported the

    shortage to Paul Dawkins, Investigation Team Manager and Tony Hills,

    Network Compliance Audit manager. I cannot recall whose decision it was to

    suspend Mrs. Misra. I also cannot recall if I asked Mrs Misra to prepare a

    hand written note to explain the discrepancy. During the audit I obtained from

    Horizon print outs that included an Office snapshot, Balance snapshots from

    each stock unit, Suspense Account Report, previous Branch Trading

    Statement, Remittances In and Out figures for this Trading Period.             On

    completion of the audit I reported the findings of the audit, in my            to
                                                                          report

     Network Compliance Audit Manager and the Outlet Intervention Team. I have

     also attended two other court cases in relation to losses. I cannot recall the

     names of either Sub Postmaster or the names of the Branches. Witness

     statement was completed at request of Investigations Team. I cannot recall

     any discussions I had with POL's legal representatives or who helped prepare

     my draft witness statement, but I was made aware I would be called to give

     evidence.



21. 1 have been- asked to consider my memo to Ms Elaine Ridge at

     [POL00049500]. I recalled that this was the findings of the audit.




22. 1 was not surprised by the outcome of the trial. Regarding the challenge of

     the integrity of the Horizon I cannot comment as I do not know the workings

     of the system and was never made aware of such issues.



23. 1 have been asked to consider the Judgment of the Court of Appeal in

     Josephine Hamilton & Others v Post Office Limited [2021] EWCA Grim 577

     at [POL00113278], in particular at paragraphs 198 to 209 on Mrs Misra's




24. My reflections on the Mrs Misra's conviction are that these are the findings of

     the court and I have no views on the outcome.

 General



 25. 1 have been asked whether I had, or was aware of, any concerns regarding



       During my career with the Post Office I was not aware of any issues with the

       Horizon system.




I believe the content of this statement to be true.
