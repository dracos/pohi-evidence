Rob,
So you have them both in one place, I attach the Expert Reports (with appendices) of:

1. Jason Coyne dated 16 October 2018 (for the Claimants), and
2. Dr Robert Worden dated 7 December 2018 (for Post Office).

I understand from my counterpart in Fujitsu’s Legal team, Chris Jay, that Fujitsu are also keen to develop a joined up
approach to the comms around these reports. I am therefore progressing with Chris this week how best we can do

that, and will send a further update once we have once we have agreed a way forward.

Please let me know if you need anything in the meantime.
Kind regards, Rod
