Jarnail,

Sorry for the delay in replying. Things were rather hectic on Tuesday
and I had a day of leave yesterday, but I note that you are chasing me
as this is urgent.

I don't have any detailed notes of my discussions with Charles.

Basically what we did was to go through his two reports (actually 2nd
and 3rd report - I've not seen the first report!) and my comments on
them.

I also explained to him some of how Horizon works and why this means
that some of his hypotheses were invalid. I also pointed out that in
order to identify exactly what was happening, then it would be necessary
to go through the detailed logs of the relevant times and that as far as
I was aware, no request had been made for any such logs (though I think
they may now have been requested) .

I told him that if we looked at the logs that we would be able to
confirm whether or not the scenario in Falkirk applied, but I thought it
was unlikely. I also described my understanding of the scenario in Mrs
Norris's witness statement as being irrelevant, though also said that I
had not been given any written description of exactly what her problem
was.

I hope that covers what you need.
Regards
Gareth

Jarnail,

I had a lengthy phone discussion with Charles McLachlan (not Alistair)
on Friday 12th Feb (about 90 mins in total).

I've not heard anything from him since, but said that I was available if
required.

Are you saying he might want a further meeting?
Regards

Gareth
