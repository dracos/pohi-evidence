1.8. Protecting the Whistleblower (Your Legal Rights)

Post Office has a statutory obligation to protect Wwhistleblowers and will endeavour to
support any individual-persenWhistleblower who or which raises genuine concerns under
this Policy in an appropriate manner, even if they or it turn out to be mistaken. In respect
of a certain class of person (broadly-"Sstaff” as defined under this policy) Post Office has
a statutory obligation not to subject such persons to detriment or to dismiss them for
Wwhistleblowing.

Where a member of Sstaff is subject to a Post Office settlement agreement, any clauses
within it will not prevent the member of Sstaff from Wwhistleblowing. This should in any
event be made clear by the terms of the settlement agreement itself and staff should
receive independent advice in relation to those terms when entering into a settlement
agreement.

Post Office will, at all times, respect-the confidentiality and protect the Wwhistleblower’s

identity, hewever:except where:

+ It may be appropriate or necessary in-the-course-of-an-investigation-to share this
information with a relevant stakeholder (e-9~an-investigator)..

* Disclosure is allowed or required by law.

There is no requirement for a Wwhistleblower to provide persenalcontact
information, but not providing this information may reduce Post Office's ability to
undertake a thorough investigation into the concerns raised. Please note that making a
disclosure anonymously means it can be more difficult for an Employee or Staff member
to qualify for protections as a Whistleblower, as there would be no documentary evidence
linking the individual to the disclosure for the Employment Tribunal to consider.

Post Office will take all reasonable steps to ensure that Wwhistleblowers who are
Employees or Staff do not suffer any detrimental treatment as a result of raising a genuine
concern in an appropriate manner. Detrimental treatment includes disciplinary action,
dismissal, threats or other unfavourable treatment connected with raising a concern.
Serious action, typically disciplinary action, will be taken against any individual who
threatens or retaliates against Wwhistleblowers in any way.

If a Wwhistleblower who is an Employee or member of Staff believes that they have
suffered any such treatment, they should inform the Whistleblowing Officer—Manager
immediately. The Whistleblowing Officer—Manager or nominated deputy will take all
necessary steps at the earliest opportunity to address any victimisation, which may include
working with the HR team to put appropriate remedial measures in place. If the matter is
not addressed the Wwhistleblower (#here-they-are-staff}-should raise it formally using
Post Office’s Grievance procedure.

In all cases the Wwhistleblower’s concerns will be treated sensitively and in confidence.

1.9-10. Responding to Whistleblowing Reports

In all instances any Wwhistleblowing reports, regardless of reporting method, will be
responded to within 5 working days and passed onto the Whistleblowing OfficerManager.

All reports will be fully reviewed and investigated and any information, including emails,
or records of telephone calls, letters, or any other form of communication will be stored
securely and confidentially.

Policy

The time frame for investigating the reports raised is dependent on the nature of the report
and the investigation required, however, the wWhistleblower will be given feedback via
the reporting channel they have used, or have given the Whistleblowing Officer Manager
permission to use (Speak Up line, e-mail or phone call) during the investigation and once
it has been concluded.

feedback in this instance could be sought through a telephone appointment or by using an

1.40-11. External Disclosures

The aim of this Policy is to provide an internal mechanism for reporting, investigating and
remedying any wrongdoing in the workplace and to demonstrate Post Office's commitment

POL-BSFF-0238411_0009
to listen to the concerns of Sstaff. In most cases individuals Whistleblowers should not find
it necessary to alert anyone externally.

However, the law recognises that in some circumstances it may be appropriate for
individuals-Whistleblowers to report their concerns to an external body such as a regulator.
It will rarely, if ever, be appropriate to alert the media at least without informing Post
Office or an external agency first and usually in that order.

Advice
We strongly encourage individtats—Whistleblowers to seek advice before reporting a

concern to anyone external. The independent whistleblowing charity, Protect (formerly
Public Concern at Work) have a list of prescribed regulators for reporting certain types of
concerns. Their contact details are as follows:

Helplined
Website: [ HYPERLINK “hitp:/www.pcaw.org.uk/advice" ]-line/- www.protect-advice.ora.uk

Protect operates free, confidential advice to people concerned about crime, danger or
wrongdoing in the workplace. All Protect advisors are legally trained and supervised by
qualified lawyers and their advice is fully confidential and subject to legal privilege. All
information, including emails, or records of telephone calls, letters, or any other form of
communication with Protect advisors is stored in a fully encrypted format.

Advice may also be sought from:

Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS) (contact details are available on

Advice may be sought which would, among things, assist Whistleblowers to verify the
position that a personal grievance is not generally regarded as a protected disclosure.

Disclosures to the FCA or PRA

Post Office Management Services (POMS) is directly regulated by the Financial Conduct
Authority (FCA), and Post Office Limited is an appointed representative of Bank of Ireland
(UK) Limited_which is authorised by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA). As such
individuals may decide to whistleblow directly to the FCA or PRA, and can do so by using

Contacting the FCA or the PRA is not conditional on a Whistleblowing report first being
made using Post Office’s internal arrangements (nor is it necessary for a disclosure to be
made to Post Office in the first instance), and it is possible to utilise Post Office’s internal
arrangements and contact the FCA or PRA simultaneously or consecutively.

Whistleblowing concerns usually relate to the conduct of our staff, but they may sometimes
relate to the actions of a third party, such as a customer, supplier, agent, Postmaster or
service provider. In some circumstances the law will protect individuals-Whistleblowers if
they raise the matter with the third party directly. However, we encourage individuals
Whistleblowers to report such concerns internally in the first instance.

2. Risk Appetite and Minimum Control
Standards

2.1. Risk Appetite

Risk Appetite is the extent to which the Group will accept that a risk might happen in
pursuit of day to day businesses transactions. It therefore defines the boundaries of
activity and levels of exposure that the Group are willing and able to tolerate.

The Group takes its legal and regulatory responsibilities seriously and consequently has”:

+ Tolerant risk appetite for Legal and Regulatory risk in those limited circumstances
where there are significant conflicting imperatives between conformance and
commercial practicality

+ Averse risk appetite for litigation in relation to high profile cases/issues

+ Averse risk appetite for ligation in relation to Financial Services matters

+ Averse risk appetite for not complying with law and regulations or deviation from
business’ conduct standards for financial crime to occur within any part of the
organisation

+ Averse Risk Appetite in relation to unethical behaviour by our staff.

The Group acknowledges however that in certain scenarios even after extensive controls
have been implemented an action may still sit outside the agreed Risk Appetite.

2.2. Policy Framework

Post Office has established a suite of policies and procedures, on a risk sensitive approach
which are subject to an annual review. The policy suite is designed to comply with
applicable legislation and regulation. The Whistleblowing Policy should be considered and
read in conjunction with other policies where relevant. These may include the Financial
Crime Policy, the Anti-Bribery & Corruption Policy, Health & Safety Policies and HR Policies
where relevant.

2-4:2.3. Minimum Control Standards
A minimum control standard is an activity which must be in place in order to manage the risks so they remain within the defined Risk
Appetite statements. There must be mechanisms in place within each impacted business unit to demonstrate compliance. The minimum
control standards can cover a range of control types, i.e. directive, detective, corrective and preventive which are required to ensure risks
are managed to an acceptable level and within the defined Risk Appetite.
The table below sets out the relationships between identified risk and the required minimum control standards in consideration of the stated
risk appetite. The subsequent pages define the terms used in greater detail:
