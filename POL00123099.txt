John,

Something in the vein of

Welcome to the event and particular guests Angela, Gayle, Jarnail and Martin Smith from CK. Investigations are a
major part of our day to day activity in supporting the business so it is of fundamental importance that they are
conducted in a manner that meets the highest standards. Today is about helping you to gain new skills, look at
different ways of doing things and where change is better, it need not always be so, challenge yourselves to make
those changes. Separation from RMG has given us the opportunity to review our processes and procedures around
investigations and the conduct guide has been produced as a result. The Second Sight review has in many ways firmly
put the spot light on to us and our capability to criminally prosecute cases in a professional manner.

We will be hearing later from Angela on how second sight has impacted on the wider business and how it may effect
what we do as a department.

The stakes have never been higher so it is vital that our processes are resilient in every area not least the governance
of investigations. Making changes quickly is never easy and can be painful, so I am extremely grateful to you all for
rising to the challenge. In many respects we have never been in a better place than we are today, but the bar ever
raises and we have to rise with it

This workshop is your day, enjoy it and get the most out of it
