Hi Alice,

thought you too might appreciate this - see below.

(I guess Laura Roper is the legal adviser to the SPMR claimant.)
Look forward to seeing you tomorrow.

All — please see the email below, which confirms mediation and reflects rather well on the approach

Rod,

I have just seen Laura Roper’s email saying that Tracey Merritt is not accepting the offer that was put by
the Post Office. it therefore brings the mediation to an end.

I have been in touch with Laura and made the suggestion that if Tracey did not understand the public
statement, and possibly not the expression of regret, then probably these could be dropped. This would
leave her with the financial settlement and the answers to the outstanding questions. However I
understand from Laura that this idea was not acceptable either.

The Post Office responded to Second Sight saying in their view this was not a suitable case for mediation
and when I saw the papers I could understand this. Nevertheless the Post Office then put in a great deal
of effort in trying to resolve the case through mediation and I don’t see how they could have done
anything more given the circurnstances.

Tracey Merritt was fortunate in having Laura Roper to assist her and she was very clear in explaining to
Tracey her legal position and what she could achieve through a settlement. It appears though that she
has some fixed ideas in her mind which were not altered during the process of the mediation despite
the constructive efforts made.

My thanks to the Post Office team for their support throughout the mediation.

With kind regards

Duncan

Duncan,
Thank you for your email, and more importantly for your efforts on Tuesday.

{attach the Heads of Terms which was sent to Tracey's solicitor on Wednesday, which I understand was
also copied to CEDR.

We will let you know how we get on.

With thanks again and kind regards,
Rod

Hello Rod

I hope this email finds you as Jess is out of the office and I am guessing your address.

Thanks very much for all your support at the mediation on Tuesday and for your constructive approach.
We came very close to settling and I am sure it was right to give Tracey more time to reflect on her

position.

I plan to call Laura today and it would be helpful if I could have a copy of the proposed Heads of Terms
you were going to email to her on Wednesday.

Hopefully we can maintain the momentum and reach a settlement shortly.
Kind regards

Duncan
