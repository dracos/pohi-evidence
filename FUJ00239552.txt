Our comms team are putting together some reactive lines in case there is media coverage after case reviews are sent to
applicants. Can you check there are ok from a Fujitsu perspective.

Thanks

Hi All,
Please find attached the draft media reactive lines for each of the SS themes (I know these will become 9 but we do
need to cover off each one individually first). The lines have been developed based on the workshop we had last week

and feedback from Angela and Gayle.

Please can I have your feedback/input on these lines by COP Monday 3" March (so that we are prepared should the
SS generic report be put into the public Wednesday evening).

It would be really helpful if you could track any changes / amendments as there are a few of you on the copy list. In
particular we are looking for facts, figures, operational procedures etc that will strengthen the lines.

Best wishes
Sophie
