Mark just raised a similar point (with slightly different suggestion on language):

Do they need an if pressed line on miscarriages of justice? "Nothing has emerged in this report to suggest wrongful
conviction. Cases have been through the judicial process and we have never relied entirely on Horizon in any court
case"

Thanks both.

On the point about current investigations/prosecutions, that’s a significant weakening of the reassuring line we
discussed earlier. Can we add something along the lines of “since start of investigation we have not pursued action
against spmrs where it is apparent that Horizon system may be involved”?

And on the past convictions, if pushed can we say that we’re not aware of any cases where we believe an appeal
would now result in a different judgment (but clearly we need to take these on a case by case basis)? Difficult not to
say something like this...

Martin — Following your conversation with Hugh he and I have discussed and think that this is be best wording we can
use (see below). The bottom line is that this dialogue and resulting potential publicity - could increase the risk of
appeals being made against previous convictions, we have no reason to believe that those appeals would be
automatically successful we would have to deal with each case on a case by case basis. There would be significant
cost implications.

It is interesting that neither of us can think of one.

Many thanks Susan and Alwen. I’ll make a few drafting changes and recirculate.

On the prosecutions section of the brief there is a half-finished sentence (see below) — what were you planning to
say?! Was this going to cover the issue around previous convictions? If not, what is our best possible defence against
the suggestion that this process had called into question the validity of previous prosecutions? Think we definitely
needa line on this.

On the first bullet below, presumably we should add a sentence to state that where it is clear that the Horizon system
isn’t the issue at stake, we have a duty to protect public money by pursuing appropriate action (and this why some
prosecutions are still happening)? Presumably there is some kind of reasonableness test here — i.e. a spmr can’t just
get off scot free by saying it’s an Horizon issue, irrespective of the circumstances?

. Prosecutions

«Where cases have been referred to SS via JFSA these are subject to the terms of the immunity agreement, which
allows non MP generated cases to be put before the JFSA and/or SS.

e For criminal prosecutions we treat each matter on a case by case basis, with an investigation and legal review
(generally involving external lawyers). We have a duty to protect public money and take appropriate action to
safeguard such public money.

e Inthe event that any person considers that there has been a miscarriage of justice they have the right to apply to
the Court of Appeal to have their conviction reviewed.
