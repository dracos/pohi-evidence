Sure — we will knock up some submissions tomorrow on this point.

The key points are (1) the manuals in all relevant periods make clear that amounts settled centrally can be
disputed and (2) the Lead Claimants did in fact settle centrally and dispute. Ultimately, therefore, the rules
were clear and the Lead Claimants acted consistently with having known the rules. Any suggestion now that
they did not know that they could dispute is self-serving and can be rejected. It is also worth noting that
many (perhaps even all) the LCs in fact admit to having known that they could dispute amounts that they
settled centrally (which is unsurprising given that they in fact did it).

There is also the even more basic point, which David has put to the witnesses: irrespective of the reason for
the shortfall or any dispute over it, it can never be honest to make a false statement subject to a declaration of
truth. We will say that even a sudden and unexplained shortfall of £20k could not justify false accounting —
the honest SPM in that circumstance simply accounts properly and throws up his hands, asking for help; he
does not lie to Post Office about the cash in the branch and hope that it never finds out.

I would be amazed if even this Judge were to say that false accounting was in some way justified. That
would be perverse, in the strict sense of that term. It is also completely irrelevant to the construction of the
contracts, although I agree that Green will try to rely on it! I imagine he may clash with the Judge on these
points in closing.

Kind Regards,

Owain

P, Owain Draper

Please can you send me the draft submissions (or an outline) on point 2. We really need to nail this point
otherwise we risk our house of cards coming down as Green will say if SPMs can't dispute losses, then PO
forces them to put inaccurate things in their accounts, that justifies false accounting, it also means that they
cannot be held liable for what their accounts say (because those accounts are plainly inaccurate because they
can't dispute mistakes), thus the normal rules of agency cannot apply to SPMs and clauses 12.12 / 4.1 should
be construed as requiring PO to prove every loss in every account.

Thanks Andy.

On your first point, is that a question for evidence or for a possible amendment to the Defence? Owain, given
that it is Stubbs, you are probably better placed to take a view?

On the second point, we could pick that up with Angela, but might get a bit lengthy for XIC. My view is that
we have the material available to deal with this in submissions.

All best

Gideon - These are fine.

Dave / Victoria — between you, please can you let the witnesses know the general nature of the questions
they will get.

Gideon - two other points.
1. What are we doing about the Stubbs defence that refers to docs from Paul Williams that Paul did not send?

This is not a problem with Paul's evidence but a mistake by the legal team in preparing the Defence so I
think we need to own up to this.

2. I'm really not comfortable that the Judge has a clear understanding of how SPMRs can dispute either
transactions corrections or end of trading period shortfalls. We could pick this up with Angela?

Thoughts?

All,

Please see attached the 2 documents we are currently intending to present as typo-corrections for our
witnesses.

There are a number of other points which will be canvassed in examination in chief rather than by written
correction, because they are (a) new evidence and/or (b) more involved than a typo correction. Currently, we
have questions for Beal (clarifying which hotline was 24 hr); Haworth (clarifying which checklist he used,
and mentioning the CoA for the Crossflatts branch); Trotter (explaining why he didn’t go through the
contract in his first interview with Dar); and Van Den Bogerd (giving figures on how many branches, both
generally and of the Cs in this case, are run by (a) companies and/or (b) multiples).

The additional points for examination in chief which arose today were for Longbottom (explaining the nature
of the 2 page balancing guide, and that it was not a replacement for the manuals) and Ridge (explaining that
there were 2 different Christines with different jobs).

Please let me know if there are any queries, internally or from the witnesses, on what will be covered.

Thanks

Gideon
