4.

Thank you for your letter of 10 September setting out your
detailed proposals for taking forward the steps we agreed at
our meeting the previous evening.

I confirm that I am content with what you have proposed. In
particular I accept the remit set out in paragraph 5 of your
letter. My objective within the initial timescale of one
month will be as a minimum to agree with the Post Office
Board the actions that need to be taken on each of the items
listed; to ensure that practical measures are put in place as
quickly as possible to take these actions forward; to
institute arrangements to monitor progress on a regular
basis; and to be in a position to report back to colleagues
such substantive progress as may have proved possible on each
by the end of the first month.

I was pleased to see that you envisage a role for the
troubleshooter which extends beyond the initial negotiation,
and that this is reflected in the draft terms of reference.
This will be important in minimising the misunderstandings
and disagreements between the parties which have undoubtedly
contributed to delays in the past.

Finally, I agree with your suggestion for an
Interdepartmental Working Group, including the Policy Unit,
and my officials stand ready to play a full and constructive
part in its work.

I am copying this letter to the Prime Minister, Jack
Cunningham, Alastair Darling and Sir Richard Wilson, and to
Ian McCartney here. r “
