Fyi below. I think Martin's away this week so would one of you mind taking a look at this asap? Perhaps we can then
speak later today (I'm out of the office at the moment) to discuss a response / next steps?

Please see attached. Could you please advise on this in terms of substance and handling. I do not know the genesis of
the Helen Rose report or what was done with it (it looks as though it was produced last Summer).

Best wishes

Dear Sirs,

As you are aware, we act on behalf of a number of SMPs in the mediation process and attach a copy of a
document sent to Della Robinson (M050) by your Solicitors, Cartwright King. It was sent to her post
conviction as a document which may affect the safety of the criminal conviction against her.

Although in the covering letter it is stated that the document is the “The Helen Rose Report”, it is clear she
has only received a short extract from a draft of the same.

In order to comply with your duty of disclosure, the full, final and unredacted copy must be sent including
appendices and exhibits. We trust that will be sent to us by return not only to comply with your legal duty of
disclosure but also to fulfil the promises made to the SMP’s to uncover the whole truth of the claims being
investigated under the mediation process.

Further the short extract we have seen confirms that the Horizon system itself can generate transaction
reversals without the knowledge or action of the SPM, or indeed anyone else and that the person to whom this
report is addressed was well aware of the integrity issues with Horizon.

This potentially has enormous consequences to all SMP’s involved and we trust that no points will be made by
yourselves or your solicitors regarding privilege as we fully intend to pursue the issues highlighted by this report, not
only in the Robinson case, but in all the cases we as a firm are dealing with.

We will also be seeking a stay on the time limits of all cases we are dealing with, until a constructive response is
received from yourselves . The SPM’s have already been the victims of injustice and we trust you will now not further
compound that by any delays in disclosing the full report and/or pursuing any technical legal points of privilege.

We look forward to an early response.

Yours faithfully.
