Lucy,

We’ ve located an archive of PinICL entries which contains some of the calls you listed, though not all, as
annotated on the list in your email below, noting that I have also added in the references that you asked about
on 31-Jan-2019, and the archived records for those are attached. The archiving was done some years ago as
an export to Access, and this Excel extract is identical in format to the Access records, so clearly any original

formatting from the PinICL system has been lost.

Dates for the PinICLs that I have supplied are on the sheet, for those we don’t have we have no other

information regarding dates other than what is suggested in the report.

The KELs listed below are all deleted rather than deprecated or archived, and are therefore not retrievable.

Subject: Peaks / Kels which have not been disclosed but referred to by Coyne [WBDUK-AC.FID27032497]

Matthew,

Jason Coyne has referred to a number of Peaks / KELs in his supplemental report that he states have not been
disclosed. Can you let me know why they are not in the PEAK / KEL extracts we have received from you? Is it
because they were all from the system "PinICL"? If you can provide any dates relating to them that would be
appreciated.

The list is as follows:

e PC0021327 [Matthew Lenton] Not in PinICL Archive.

@ PC0032801[Matthew Lenton] See attached info from PinICL archive.

@ PC0038631 [Matthew Lenton] See attached info from PinICL archive.

 PC0044101/Matthew Lenton] See attached info from PinICL archive.

e PC006863 we think this must be PC0006863 [Matthew Lenton] See attached info from PinICL archive.
@ PC0069918 [Matthew Lenton] Not in PinICL Archive.

@ PC014479 we think this must be PC0014479 [Matthew Lenton] See attached info from PinICL archive.

KELs:

@ MWright531p/Matthew Lenton] This is a deleted KEL, not a deactivated KEL, therefore cannot be retrieved.
Report suggests this is from 2000.
