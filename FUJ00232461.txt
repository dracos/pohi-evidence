1 Introduction

CS MSU is responsible for calculating payments in respect of SLA
performance which falls below contracted levels and results in the payment of
remedies to PON. SLA performance remedy payments may arise in respect
of:

e System Service — Calls received by HSH in respect of hardware and
network problems which fail to be handled within contracted times;

e OBCS Stops — Stop lists despatched to post offices which fail to be
delivered due to network failures;

« Data File Delivery - TPS, APS and OBCS data files which fail to be
delivered within contracted times.

In addition, CS MSU is responsible for calculating payments in respect of
business incidents which under the terms of the contract attract charges. The
majority of business incidents attracting charges will be identified from TPS
Reconciliation Reports and will be raised by CS MSU, whilst others may be
generated by ICL Pathway SSC or PON. Manual Error Reports will be
completed for these business incidents.

Once notified of the payments due by CS MSU, ICL Pathway Finance
Department is responsible for raising credit notes in respect of these
payments.

2 Scope
This document describes the process by which SLA performance remedy and
business incident payments are calculated and paid to PON.

The process within the document begins from the point that the data
necessary to calculate the payments has been received by CS MSU and ends
at the point that a credit note is despatched to PON. The document aims to:

e Identify the interfaces required between CS, Finance and PON;

e Describe the process required to ensure that appropriate payments are
made to PON in respect of SLA performance remedies and business
incidents;

e Highlight the timescales required for undertaking activities.
