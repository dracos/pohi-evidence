Horizon data

Executive Summary

04/10/2022 at 10:42 for a British Telecom bill payment for
£76.09; this wag paid for by a Lloyds TSB cash withdrawal for
£80.00 and change give for £3.91. At 10:37 on the same day
the British Telecom bill payment wag reversed out to cash

settlement,

The branch was issued with a Transaction Correction for
£76.09, which they duly settled; however the postmaster denied
reversing this transaction and involved a Forensic Accountant
as he believed his reputation was in doubt.

Reviewing the data

reversal was completed by
04/10/2012 and was reversal indicator 1 (existing reversal)

Questions asked and extracts from various emails in response.

Question - r am requesting fujitsu logs for to
look at a revergal that II denies transacting, do
I need to request further details, and also could you explain

what happens when the system fails, (MM looked at data at
his end prior to me receiving the fujitsu logs, (Copy in

Appendix 1).

Answer - This shows that Session 537803 was successfully saved
to the BRDB, but when the user Logged On again
Recovery reversed the session in session 537805,

Tt isn’t clear what failed, but if it was a comms error, then
the system would have printed a disconnected session receipt
and the Clerk should have given the customer £80 and told him
his Bill was unpaid. The fact that there is no indication of
such a receipt in the events table Suggests the counter may
POL00147949
POL00147949

have been rebooted and so perhaps may have crashed in which
ease the clerk may not have been told exactly what to do,

The reversal was due to recovery (Counter Mode Id@ = 118) so
this was not an explicit reversal by the clerk. This scenario

have made a mistake and either he or the customer could be in
pocket / out of pocket (depending on exactly what happened!) .
The system is behaving as it should. (email 30/01/2013)

Question - I can clearly see the recovery reversal on the
fujitsu logs received, but would this have been clear had we
not previously discussed this issue, (Copy of transactions
and events in Appendix 1)

Answer - Note that the standard ARQ spreadsheet may not make
it easy to confirm that the Reversal was part of Recovery, but
the underlying logs used to extract them can show it. (Email
30/01/2013)

The files 4 to 25 Oct 12.xls and Events 4 to 25 Oct 12.xls are
bart of the standard ARQ veturned. Rows 141 to 143 of 4 to 25
Oct 12.xls clearly show a Reversal, Also Row 70 of Events 4
to 25 Oct 12.xls shows that session 537803 (ie rows 138 to 140
of 4 to 25 Oct 12.xls) has been recovered and this event hag
the same timestamp ag the Reversal Session, Also row 71 of
Events 4 to 25 Oct 12.xls shows that a xveceipt was generated
from the session 537805 (not explicitly, but it was the only
session at that time), This receipt would have told the user
that a Rollback had taken place (but the logs don’t make that
explicit). If that is sufficient for you purposes, then you do
have all you need in the standard ARQ.

logs is confirmation that the reversal was generated by the
system (and not manually by the user). what might also be
available in the underlying logs is whether or not the system
was re-booted - I suspect it was but have no evidence one way
or the other (and it isn’t in what was extracted this time

either). 4 can confirm that the user did Log On again (row 69
of Events 4 to 25 oct 12,.x1s). (Email 11/02/2013)
Question - I can see where this transaction is and now

understand the reason behind it, My main concern is that we
use the basic ARQ logs for evidence in court and if we don’t
know what extra reports to ask for then in some circumstances
we would not be giving a true picture,

I know you are aware of all the horizon integrity issues and 1
want to ensure that the ARQ logs are used and understood fully
by our operational team who have to work with this data both
in interviews and in court.

Just one question from my part - if the reversal is system
created but shows as an existing reversal, could this not be
reflected with a different code, .i.e. SR (system reversed) to
clear up any initial challenges, My feelings at the moment
are not questioning what Horizon does as I fully believe that
it is. working as it should, it is just that I don’t think that
POL00147949
POL00147949

some of the system based correction and adjustment
transactions are clear to us on either credence or ARQ logs,

Answer - [ understand your concerns, It would be relatively
simple to add an extra column into the existing ARQ report
Spreadsheet, that would make it clear whether the Reversal
Basket wag generated by Recovery or not, 1 think this would
address your concern, I’m not sure what the formal Process ig
for changing the report layout. Penny can you advise as to the
process: Is thig done through a cr? {email 13/02/2013)

Recommendations

I do believe that the system has behaved as it shoulda and I do
not see thig scenario occurring regularly and creating large
losses, However, my concerns are that we cannot Clearly see

My recommendation ig that a change request is submitted go
that all system created reversals are clearly identifiable on
both fujitsu and credence,
