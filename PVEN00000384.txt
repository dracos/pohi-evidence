Thanks Duncan, If I may share with you (not.a secret but we haven't yet told the boys): John has beeni 77777777 [oa

and me - I have two new jobs and will be leaving in the next couple of months: Chair of Imperial College Health Trust and Non-
Executive at the Cabinet Office. With Morrisons and one more, that should be enough to go fully portfolio. I will not look for a
fourth role until we see how John’s treatment goes. We are hoping to make the Post Office announcement next week and Al
will be interim CEO if BEIS approve that. When I can confirm you'll be one of the first to know officially. All of which means,
that re the legal case, I should be around for the next 3/4 weeks, after which John’s treatment will get unpleasant and I'll be
with him. Then Rob, Jane (GC) and Al will be your best contacts and I will put you in touch. Enjoy your weekend. Paula

Hi Paula. I am so sorry to hear about John. It must be such a worrying time. I wish you both all the luck in the world. Please
give him our very best regards.

Thank you for the heads up on your new roles. The combination sounds really fulfiling and I do hope we'll be able to maintain
our relationship as you move on from the Post Office

If there’s anything that we can do please let us know.

Best wishes. . Duncan
