1. Introduction

1.1 Purpose of Document

This document has been drafted to provide clarification requested by Connie Penn on a number of testing
issues related to HNG-X PCI compliance.

1.2 Introduction

The following is drawn from a paper on the scope of PCI work for POL produced by Rebecca Eynon, Fujitsu
Services:

RMGA are not implementing a solution to provide PC! compliance — instead putting in place a number of measures
as explicitly agreed with POL. These measures address individual aspects of the PCI requirements from VISA and
Mastercard.

The main changes are:

© CCN 1202: Handling of Track 2 (to avoid it being stored even when encrypted, and PAN) and network
protocol (encryption algorithms use of SSL etc.)

© CCN 1231: File integrity monitoring

These changes are made to lots of systems within the data centres, which become capable of handling both old and
new style transactions. The changes also use some of the new HNG-X components such as BAL and HSM (Atalla
hardware security modules).

However the actual business change is only achieved as the counter software update is applied to the estate. This is
the main reason for the retro-fitting of the changes to the Horizon branch estate.

Due to network design (routing from Horizon counters to the BAL) It is only after weekend D that we can actually start
to roll out the Horizon branch changes. Hence we achieve the PCI required protection on Track 2 and Card holder
data (PAN etc.) gradually and can only claim conformance when we have completed the Horizon counter roll-out.

1.2.1 CCN 1202

CCN 1202 describes Fujitsu's proposed response to CR-957. This CR requested certain modifications to the HNG-X
system, namely;

1. The Solution Architecture and proposal for HNG-X is updated to ensure that PCI “Sensitive Authentication
Data” (including PIN blocks) is not stored in any file or database including log, audit or diagnostic files after
a transaction has been authorised even if the data is encrypted. Such data must also be deleted after use.
Exceptionally, any data element required to be submitted in the settlement or reconciliation files may be
retained for a configurable number of days after the file is successfully submitted. For the avoidance of
doubt, it can be assumed that reference data will not be set to collect Track 2 data from payment cards for
the loyalty card program. Apply from the start of the pilot phase.

2. The Solution Architecture and proposal for HNG-X is updated to ensure that PCI "Sensitive Cardholder
Data’ (ie. PAN) is rendered unreadable anywhere it is stored (including data on portable media, backup
media, and in logs) by using any of the approaches approved by PCI. For the avoidance of doubt, this
requirement does not apply to the notification of scanned account numbers passed via AP to POCA to
record the issue of cards. After the final Horizon Counter has moved to the HNG X application.

3. The Solution Architecture and proposal for HNG-X is updated to ensure that all PC! Sensitive Authentication
Data and PCI Sensitive Cardholder Data is encrypted using approved algorithms and encryption protocols
whilst in transit over any public network unless specifically agreed in writing by the client. [Approved
algorithms are 128-bit 3DES (as per ANSI X9.52) and 256-bit AES (FIPS 197). Approved encryption
protocols are SSL v3 / TLS, SSH, IPSec, and PPTP v2]. Apply from the start of the pilot phase.

4. The Fujitsu CCD “Service Description for the Security Management Service” (Ref: CS/SER/016) is updated
to cover support for the annual Level 1 PC! audit of HNG-X. Should be assumed to occur within a year of
HNG-X going into Pilot.

The Horizon PCI Counter update is dependant on the availability of the Branch Access Layer and the Branch
Database. It is NOT dependant on the Data Centre migration; this is simply a consequence of the current plan which
requires the BAL and the Branch Database to be implemented into the new Data Centres.

PCI Compliance will NOT be achieved when the Data Centre migration has happened. As stated above, PCI
compliant transactions are produced as a result of;

a) Horizon PCI Counter update or,
b) HNG-X Application rollout.
Therefore, until the entire estate has been updated, (to either one of the Horizon PCI Counter or the HNG-X

Counter), Track 2 data will still be created and sent by the Counters, and will be processed and stored by the core
Data Centre systems.

1.2.2. CCN 1231

This change only applies to HNG-X and is in support of POL's business requirement to conform to the PCI Data
Security Standard. It is issued in response to POL CR 01119 which requests;

4. Identify File Integrity Monitoring software to implement in the cardholder environment within HNGX.
2. Identify the boundaries of the cardholder environment within HNGX.

3. Propose costs for implementing and supporting File Integrity Monitoring within HNGX for agreement by POL.
4. Propose acceptance criteria for implementing File Integrity Monitoring within HNGX for agreement by POL.

The agreed scope of the requirement is to implement File Integrity Monitoring software into the HNG-X Data Centre
environment to protect the Cardholder Environment. (This is defined in the attached Solution Outline).

To meet the requirements of CRO1119, it is proposed that the Tripwire File Integrity Monitoring product be installed
on all systems within the Cardholder Environment. This software works by creating a signature for each file it is
monitoring, storing this in a secured location and re-evaluating the files on a periodic basis. The file signature is
compared to the original on each re-evaluation and an event is raised if there are any changes.

In Release One of HNG-X, this is an installation of;

* The file integrity monitoring software

*__ The appropriate template for that operating system

* — Specific changes based on the Platform Type

Compliance Reports can be produced as required to show that files have not been changed since there installation
or last approved update.

A process will need to be developed such that when a new release of software is applied to a monitored system, the
events raised are expected and can be dealt with correctly.

Documentation will be provided from Jim Sweeting to show that the HNG-X architecture meets the
requirements of these CCNs.

4 Vulnerability testing in both datacentres

A high level security test plan has been drafted and circulated for formal review (document reference
TSTGENHTP0004).

Brian Pinder has overall responsibility for vulnerability and penetration testing in both data centres, a low
level test plan is being created and implemented.

Mark Havard is available for a two week period from 8'" September 2008 and will assist in the creation of
the low level test plan.

David Cohen and Nigel Taylor are permanent security testing resources and will assist with security
testing as directed.

Brian Pinder has confirmed that initial vulnerability/penetration testing will be conducted in the first
instance by Fujitsu prior to formal external testing by an approved scanning vendor (ASV) in Q1 2009
prior to go live.

5 Custom code review plans

At present it is believed that as there is no external facing web code there will be no need for any code
review for PCI compliance purposes.

It is not clear whether any server or client side Java or JavaScript will be subject to review for PCI
compliance, clarification is requested if this is in fact a requirement.

6 Penetration testing

FJS will provide resources independent from the HNG-X project to plan and carry out vulnerability
assessments and penetration tests. A draft Vulnerability and Penetration Test plan will be produced in
September 2008.

Vulnerability and Penetration testing will subsequently be added to the overall HNG-X Programme Plan.

The interface between the Security Testing HLTP and the penetration test/vulnerability assessment test
plans will be considered to ensure that no duplication of work occurs and to ensure that sample testing of
relevant tests in the HLTP exists.

Test scripts will be entered in Joint Quality Centre, with detailed test outputs and documentation held in
Dimensions to allow for audit and repeatability of test results.

It has been established that PCI Penetration testing is a very small subset of the overall penetration
testing to be carried out, but penetration testing is not something the joint test team will be doing as this is
being handled by Fujitsu Services under the direction of Brian Pinder.

7 Firewall testing

Testing of both the firewalls themselves and the subnets they protect will be covered by penetration
testing, firewall testing, and firewall configuration/rulebase reviews.

Jim Sweeting has confirmed that a milestone plan which shows that tests are performed at the various
stages of migration from the test environment(s) to the fully operational state will be produced by the
customer service security team.

Brian Pinder has overall responsibility for testing in the data centres, all testing will be documented.

8 Segmentation between test and _ production
environments.

The network architecture stipulates that the SANs use separate disks for test and production systems to
ensure that drive segmentation exists not only logically but also physically.

Network segmentation has been built in to the security architecture as per the ARC/SEC/ARC/0003
security architecture and SAN HLD documents (document reference DES/NET/HLD/0007).

A review of segmentation between test and production environments will take place, this testing will be
conducted by Fujitsu and will commence on 19'" January 2009. A three week testing window has been
scheduled.

During this period a network review and data cleanup will be undertaken before the BC weekend
migration (the weekend of the migration of the batch and online systems to the IRE11 and IRE19 data
centres).

An external penetration test that includes tests in this scope has been scheduled for 16-23 March 2009.
These tests will be conducted in the first instance by Fujitsu.

Connie Penn is to advise of any specific concerns identified to data with data leakage.

Jim Sweeting is to verify how segmentation can be verified and/or demonstrated.

9 Personnel

Assurance has been requested that any external company/consultant/testers used to test the cardholder
environment have PCI DSS knowledge and experience.

PCI ASV and QSA contractors will obviously have the relevant PCI experience and knowledge.

It has been established that most joint test team testers will need a thirty minute intranet based CBT
course.

It is expected that security specialists will need to complete more in-depth training.
