OK, Gareth, thanks.

I've put together the basis. of your statement based on your comment's in the
Accountant's report and attach. We can discuss and send next week.

Did you realise that this accountant is also engaged on the Porters Lane case?

~ have responded to POL that we are unable to progress further on Porters Lane at
.east until the back end of next week.

Pete Thompson didn't want to progress the issue at all and asked me to hold on for
Tom.

An interesting week ahead!

Have a good weekend
Penny

Gareth
I'll try to do this today; I'm not in tomorrow.
I agree with your comments.

We need to make sure we are charging correctly for your time; which code do you book
to when you work on litigation support?

Kind regards

Penny,
I popped up earlier, but you were busy with Pete Thompson.

I don't think I can produce anything formal this week.

Do you have time to put something together for me to sign? I'm also slightly
concerned that some of my comments are "this is for POL to answer", but that is
probably OK in this case.

Our defence barrister has asked for all of Gareth's replies in relation to
the Defences 2nd Interim Report (see attachment below) to be produced as a
witness statement. I would suggest that the question from the defence is
reproduced and then Gareth's repliés are recorded immediately after for
clarity purposes.

A pre. court hearing has been set for the 1st February and ideally if
possible it would be helpful if the statement could be received by Friday
of this week. Could you let me know if this is going to be possible.

Heré is the answer from Fujitsu to the points that you asked about.

Penny is keen to know that this is all that is required from them, can you
et me know?

Regarding the other ponts, Mark emailed Rob Wilson for some clarity/advice
and I am still awaiting the information.

Thanks

Trial 15th March 2009 Guildford Crown Court I

Hi Jane

hope all is well with you.

Our expert, Gareth Jenkins, has made comments on the 2nd Interim
Technical expert's report, which I attach for review by Prosecution
Counsel. Please note that where POL is required to respond he has
stated so in the text. We agreed that in the New Year we would discuss
how this would be presented.

As for Question 3 of your note dated 2 December, the simple answer is
that the system will behave very differently in that all the data will
be held in a central database and the UI will be very different.
However the basic principles for accounting will be the same, though
much of the detail in terms of error handling etc will change. "If more
detail is required then that really requires a full discussion on how
HNG-X works and will get very lengthy and involved.

Andy has responded to Jon Longman's note of 16 November. That leaves
questions 1 and 2 of your note dated 2 December outstanding and Andy is
waiting for a response from Jon Longman before he can proceed.

I believe all questions are covered - do you agree?

aind regards ‘
Penny

Court

Jane

I attach a report from the defence expert where he has highlighted a
number

of problems with the Horizon system. Our barrister, Warwick Tatford has
asked that the problemswith Horizon that he has raised in his report are
replied to in a witness statement form. I presume that an employee of
“ajitsu would have to produce the witness statement.

(See attached file: misra - 2nd interim technical expert's report
19.11.09.doc) (See attached file: misra -electronic Funds Tranfer PCI
sched. doc)

In addition to this the defence have also requested the following
information with regard the hardware equipment installed at West
Byfleet.

1) Please providé details of any business testing carried out by the
Post

Office on the system before it went live.

2) Please provide the service logs for the system at West Byfleet PO
for a

period commencing six months prior to the defendant taking over as sub
postmistress (30/06/2005) to the present day.

3) Please confirm when and why the hardware in. the system at West
Byfleet

PO has been changed.

4) By whom have these changes been made. .

5) When new hardware was installed at West Byfleet was it brand new or
-econditioned

6) If it is the latter please confirm the identity of the PO from which
the ;

reconditioned hardware came and why the hardware has been removed from
that

PO.
