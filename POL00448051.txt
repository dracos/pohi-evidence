Postmaster contracts - summary of judgment

You may be aware of the agreed settlement of the group litigation in the High Court in
December 2019 between Post Office and a group of mainly former postmasters.

We want to build a more open, two-way relationship with postmasters and to continue to
improve the support we provide you, and that includes making sure we address the
points made by the Judge in the group litigation.

One of the two trials looked at how the contract between Post Office and the postmaster
should work. The judgment in this trial made several legal findings that change some
parts of the contract.

As the judgment is very long and detailed, to help postmasters we have summarised the
words used by the judge where his judgment changes the meaning of the contracts
involved, and you can read the summary hereflink].

The summary is not a variation of your contract, and you don’t need to do anything with
this information. We are providing this information for postmasters to ensure you are
aware of how the judge in the case changed the meaning of certain parts of the contract
between Post Office and the postmaster.

Please note there are several types and variations of contract in use across the network
and all of the changes may not apply to all contracts.

We are reviewing whether there are improvements we can make to postmaster contracts
longer-term, so if we do introduce further changes following this review we will let you
know.

If you have any questions about this, please speak to your area manager who will be
happy to help.

You may have seen that we also recently launched a [ HYPERLINK

guide-out-now/" ] to bring together the various support sources and channels available to
you.
