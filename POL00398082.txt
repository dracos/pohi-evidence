Run: Service Delivery Dashboard Service improvementsryjitsu

Ensures single counter branches are prioritised as without
printer they cant trade

Opex saving through replacement with ADSL and 2G/3G
backup

Opex savings and quicker support diagnosis through
improved tooling giving better service to branches.

Allows focus on Cat A calls providing greater service to
branches in line with priority.

Improves the day to day usability for all sub postmasters
and service to ebayers

Drives faster response time and improves availability of the
rural network

BIMs respond to recurring issues in branches and trouble
shoot to resolve recurring branch issues. Improves overall
Service above SLA.

Speeds up deployment of a “rebuilt “counter improving
recovery or deployment of equipment in branches.

This tracks the improvements Fujitsu is self funding following meetings and workshops with Post Office, NFSP and

service to all Post Office stakeholders.

Finance Context FUJITSU

Assumption

@ Underlying finance framework for the account covering HNGX and HPBB
contracts is operating effectively and transparently.

e HPBB has some further work to do covering revenue and cost

™ For this forum, we can include content but it will be nothing more than a
restatement, commentary, narrative on the monthly position.

Alternatively

@ A Run-the-Post Office forum should track transaction cost on a per product
per ticket item basis.

@ Pareto analysis will show that 80% of the cost will be skewed towards 20%
of the products. Breaking out this analysis will point to a prioritisation.

@ Investment can then be prioritised towards these products.
@ Invest-to-save.
