Start time: Units:

I had a telephone conversation with Richard Morgan.

Firstly, going over Greg Booth’s Witness Statement with him and explaining to Richard the
conversation I had just had with Gareth Jenkins and what the position now was. Also e-
mailing over to Richard the relevant amended section and Richard tweaking the wording
slightly of paragraph 6.

Secondly, discussing with Richard paragraph 4 of Mike Mason’s e-mail of 6 November. I had
several points to make on this. Firstly, Mr Castleton did not keep remittances of stock but he
was supposed to. Secondly, we have the records of the cash that we sent to him. Richard
and I agreed that I would need to bottom out whether this included pension cash. I said that
I suppose Mr Castleton could just scan the cash in and then the cash account would show
what cash had been scanned in as opposed to what was actually there. Also Richard said
that Mr Castleton declared the cash in the cash declaration. I am to check with Fujitsu
whether the Horizon system records all the details of the cash declarations ie. all the
denominations, or just the total stock. We agreed it would be bizarre if the Postmaster had
to enter in all the different denominations and quantities of such, if the system only recorded
the total.

Finally, telling Richard I had received a voicemail from Mr Turner of Rowe Cohen. Their e-
mail system was not working yesterday which is why apparently the Defence and
Counterclaim has been delayed until today.
