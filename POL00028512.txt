1 Introduction

In accordance. with the monitoring requirements for AI408, the HSH sites at both
Stevenage and Manchester are recording all Cash Account calls for a six-week period
from 03/12/99. The taped calls are then being reviewed by POCL who will make an
assessment as to the HSH’s ability to:

¢ Conform to the narrative contained within the Cash Account scripts
© Give out correct advice avoiding a negative impact on the POCL business

: Following the initial review by POCL, a joint exercise was undertaken by ICL
Pathway and POCL to re-evaluate any calls, which POCL had assessed as failing the
above criteria.

2 Scope

This document highlights the results of the joint ICL Pathway / POCL review and
identifies any areas where it is felt that improvements are required to the HSH call
scripts or TSA knowledge, to avoid instances in the future of incorrect advice being
supplied to the outlets.

An ‘Improvement Plan’ is also included in order to ensure any changes are delivered
in advance of the projected commencement of roll out on 24/01/00.

3 Review Summary

3.1 Initial POCL Results

POCL reviewed 45 calls out of 177 recorded for Cash Account activity on 08 &

' 09/12/99. Out of the calls reviewed, 13 were deemed to have failed in that by incorrect
advice being given by the HSH this could have a negative impact on their business, or
the HSH deviated from the Cash Account script.

This retuned an initial POCL derived result of 71.1% compliance, (+/- 11%.)

3.2 Joint ICL Pathway / POCL Results

Out of the 13 calls deemed to have failed by POCL, 12 were reviewed jointly by ICL
Pathway and POCL, (including representatives from the HSH). One call could not be
traced despite extensive searching through the tapes.

All calls reviewed appeared to follow the Cash Account scripts where this was
possible, however some ran out of script.

Calls were handled professionally at all times with a good rapport between the HSH
TSA and the outlet. At no time did the ICL Pathway reviewers detect any frustration
being displayed by the outlet. Where the call failed in terms of the quality of advice

given by the HSH, the relationship between the TSA and the outlet did not degenerate,
even when the outlet was aware that perhaps the advice being given was incorrect.

Summary of Results:

Improvement Plan

Improvement Opportunities Identified from week 1

In order to ensure the maximum number of calls are handled correctly it is necessary
to implement an improvement plan in line with any contractual requirements to ensure
that advice given by the HSH does not impact adversely on the POCL business. The
components of this improvement plan have to be developed, tested and implemented
within the HSH prior to the expected commencement of roll out on 24/01/00.

From the 13 calls analysed in this joint review, and from experience gained within the
ICL Pathway Customer Service Management Information Reporting, specific areas
can be identified as causing confusion either in the outlet or at the HSH, these are
believed to be:

1. Out of hours stock units (e.g. Lottery) and associated prize allocations

2. Discrepancies and dealing with the entire complex subject of reversals and
suspense accounts

In addition, ICL Pathway believe that knowledge within the HSH of the following
areas of the POCL business need re-enforcing:

3. Procedures surrounding the use of the transaction log to identify errors
4. Procedures surrounding the transfer between stock units
5. Where a business rule needs to be invoked by the NBSC

There is also a need to ensure that the HSH have the means to quickly acquire
knowledge of any new procedures or products, i.e. Family Tax Credit.

Of the areas identified above, ICL Pathway believes separate call scripts need to be
developed for points 1 & 2 above, whilst the other areas require review and any
deficiencies made good.

In order to complete this work as quickly as possible, both ICL Pathway and POCL
have committed to work with the HSH in providing the narrative for the new call
scripts and any changes following review of existing scripts, as the areas highlighted
are complex in nature and an understanding of the impact of any advice given to the
outlet by the HSH is required.

4.2 Other improvement Opportunities

4.2.1 Compilation of Scripts

ICL Pathway will take the lead in developing the scripts further and use the Helpdesk
forum to present any changes and allow POCL feedback and agreement. ICL Pathway
will be responsible for ensuring effective Change Control Processes are applied to the
scripts document,

4.2.2 Conformance to Scripts

ICL Pathway will re-enforce the use of the first script, which identifies where the
SPM is within the system. ICL Pathway will also ensure that all new TSAs follow the
scripts conscientiously. POCL will communicate across the Network to ensure that
the Outlets understand the rationale behind using scripts within Support Centres.

4.2.3 Audit of Calls

POCL will give ICL Pathway two days notice to undertake an audit of the calls on-
site but remote from the TSAs. All cash accounting calls during the audit will be
recorded for reference purposes. POCL will identify improvement opportunities and
share these with ICL Pathway for implementation.

4.2.4 Proactive Improvement Process

ICL Pathway will adopt a proactive improvement process regarding learning
opportunities for dealing with cash accounting calls. They will keep POCL informed
of these through the Helpdesk forum. This activity may result in changes to scripts
and/or improvements to the training programme.

4.2.5 Call Resolution Coding

ICL Pathway will review their cash accounting call closure codes and POCL will
assist in the exercise by sharing their cash account call classification. ICL Pathway
will then use this as a tool to identify future improvements.

4.2.6 Interface Agreement

An interface agreement will be established between the HSH and NBSC to identify
responsibilities between the Support Centres and agree consistent procedures. This
agreement will enable the reduction of inappropriate calls being transferred to either
Support Centre. Both parties are committed to working together to jointly reduce the
volume of calls falling within this category.

4.2.7 Helpdesk Forum

A forum has been established consisting of representatives between the HSH, NBSC,
ICL Pathway and POCL and the first meeting is scheduled for 27/10/00. This forum
will report into the Horizon Service Review Forum. The objectives of this group will
be defined and agreed between ICL Pathway and POCL. The group will meet monthly
with one of the agenda items being improvement to scripts. They will be targeted at
reducing the number of inappropriate calls being transferred between Support Centres.
POCL will investigate the possibility of advance notice to the Support Centres of
changes that are included in Counter News.

4.2.8 Electronic Link between Support Centres

A feasibility study has taken place to establish whether technologically calls can be
transferred between the two Support Centres in real time. The findings from the study
need to be agreed and implemented. This would reduce the impact of poor diagnosis
within the Outlets.

4.2.9 Horizon Guide to Balancing

POCL have produced a guide to assist postmasters when balancing called “Balancing
with Horizon”. This guide is expected to be out in the field by the end of January.

Prior to this guide being issued the scripts will be reviewed to ensure that. they
conform to the detail within the guide.
