Good morning Nick

I have sent these to Sarah and Dieter to Obvious Post Office is allowed and should meet with

Could you please organise a response after our Board tomorrow ? At least one NED has said I should meet them but I
think that would be a mistake . We do need something to say to them in our reply however . Many thanks .
