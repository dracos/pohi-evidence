The Fraud Strand currently has a

recovery objective for 2007/008.

Deliver casework effectively to ensure 30%
loss recovery, or greater, is achieved 2007/08.
It would not be unreasonable to project
future Fraud Strand recovery targets to
increase year on year

Deliver casework effectively to ensure 35% loss
recovery, or greater, is achieved 2008/09.

Deliver casework effectively to ensure 40% loss

recovery, or greater, is achieved 2009/10. Etc. Etc.

that the offender has already spent. Gs205-

* Motor vehicle checks with PNC and DVLA

* These checks will establish ownership of vehicles

« The checks should be made to the address requesting a
list of all vehicles

* The document returned will list all vehicles in a larger
post code area than the one requested and you will
need to filter out the data to show which belong to or
may be linked to your suspect

* They cannot be requested for confiscation
investigations so if you don’t request it under section
29 (3) of the data protection act we loose the chance to
obtain this data later.

Land registry checks

This will establish ownership of Properties, Flats,
Houses, Shops, Land and POST OFFICES.

This is often the largest asset suspects own or have an
interest in.

Don’t forget our employees and franchisees have a
personal file which contains address data.

Take a note of any property that you believe the suspect
has an interest in not just those they claim are theirs.

Remember that even though they don’t own a Post Office
or Retail outlet, does not mean that they do not have a
financial interest in it. They may have a lease or under-

may previously have no detail.

* They also provide other interesting information
(addresses, companies, partnerships etc.)

* The “Gateway” for this information requires that you
suspect a person of a criminal offence and that
searches against persons related to your suspect
(Husband, Wife, Child, aunty etc...) requires a link to
that criminality beyond simply being related.

issues.

forms, at an early stage.

« Use Gs045 not only to prove the predicate offence but
to give indications as to what assets the suspect has.

high priority not just the predicate offence admissions

Make whatever recoveries you can as and when you
can.

Seize anything you believe is evidence of an offence or
items obtained as a consequence of an offence.
Consider asking the AFI for restraint under POCA 2002
section 41. (If you have a real and not fanciful belief that
the suspect may dissipate any asset which could be
subject of a confiscation order, bear in mind you will
need to supply sufficient details for the AFI to write a
witness statement)

Be open minded when it comes to Criminal Property.

* Theft, Fraud and Money laundering offences support the
POCA 2002 and Criminal Justice Act 1988 confiscation
process and in consequence recovery of the loss.

* Settling for false accounting as the predicate offence
creates massive problems with recovery (what is the
offenders benefit).

* The investigation and the interview should be
programmed to establish what has happened to, what is
and where is the criminal property, what offences have
occurred, and to what extent others are involved in
those offences and/or have benefited.
