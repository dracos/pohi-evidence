Title: HIJ Assurance Desk Top Review Report Date: I 16" August 2024
Author: Sundeep Mehta, Head of Group Sponsor: Anshu Mathur, Group Assurance Director
Assurance

Background

As part of the Historical Matters Assurance plan, subsequently renamed ‘Legacy Matters Assurance Plan’
approved by the General Executive in September 2022, Group Assurance (GA) commenced an assurance
review on the remediation status of the Horizon Issue Judgements (HIJ) in October 2022.

This review, which was risk based, was subsequently paused in March 2023", as several artefacts, self-
assessments (and related GA preliminary concerns) were in the process of being updated/submitted by the
Horizon Technology Team (HTT). In addition, HIJ remediation was also subject to the oversight of the then
reconstituted IDG2.0, of which GA was a member.

In November 2023, HTT updated IDG2.0 and provided a detailed self-assessment of the status of HlJ
remediations. IDG2.0 agreed that GA should perform an objective desk top review based on the information
presented by HTT and evidence they provide to support their assessment.

HTT have broken down the 15 HlJ findings into 47 sub deliverables (please refer to Appendix 1), of which ten
are duplicates (Appendix 2). Our report provides an opinion on the status of 37 sub deliverables.

Approach

The GA review in September 2022 adopted a risk based / sustainable approach and hence was broader (similar
to the GA approach adopted and completed for ClJ) in contrast to our current approach which is a desk top
review, and therefore significantly contingent on the artefacts and quality of documentation provided by the
HTT. The desk top review was performed during March 2024 to July 2024.

GA Opinion

From the data and artefacts provided, by HTT, it is overtly evident that a significant amount of work, effort and
remediation(s) have occurred. That said, at the time of reporting and based on the evidence provided by HTT,
the status of the 37 HlJ deliverables is as follows:

e Fully met: 5
In GA opinion clear evidence has been provided to support HTT assertions. (Refer to Appendix 3)
e¢ Met, with some residual exposure: 7

In GA opinion, whilst the principle of the commitment has been adhered to, some residual exposure may
exist, that may warrant additional action/support. (Refer to Appendix 4)

« Not met: 25

In GA opinion, evidence provided does not fully support HTT assertion on the status of completion. This
category can be further broken into three categories (Refer to Appendix 5):

o No evidence: 5
o Evidence not deemed sufficient: 17
o Considered as work in progress: 3

In our opinion, the above status may not represent the actual state of conformance, i.e. the overall position
might be better. Our view is predicated on the artefacts and evidence provided by HTT which were not
sufficiently complete, nor structured or provided in a logical manner to support the desk top review. These
concerns were conveyed and discussed with HTT in April and May 2024, however due to restricted capacity
within HTT, we were requested to continue our review.

2 Audit, Risk & Committee was informed in July 2023.

HU Sub- Detail

No HU

4 1-14 Defects caused apparent or alleged discrepancies or shortfalls relating to Sub Postmasters branch accounts or transactions.

2 Sub Postmasters were not informed about identified defects. Some defects were not identified by automatic system check and as a result, lay undiscovered for
years.

3 Legacy Horizon and HNG-X were not remotely robust, as identified by the number of defects found. The lack of records or logs for the use of powerful access
roles also contributes to this.

4 15-26 Data errors, arising from data entry, transfer, or processing in both legacy Horizon and HNG-x led to financial discrepancies. Errors in reference data, and 3
party data contributed to discrepancies in branch accounts.

5 If data in Horizon was wrong (due to defects) and did not reconcile to third party data manual Transaction Corrections were undertaken.

6 Legacy Horizon and HNG-X measures and controls did not prevent, identify, or report or reduce a) data entry errors b) data packet or system level errors c)
software coding errors or bugs d) transmission, replication, and storage of transactional record data errors e) data stored in the central data centre not being an
accurate record of transactions on branch terminal.

7 *27-36 I POL and Fujitsu could both access transaction data recorded by Horizon remotely (i.e. not from within a branch).

8 41-47 POL was plainly reliant upon Fujitsu for diagnosis of whether the occurrence of shortfalls was caused by defects within Horizon.

9 “*37-40 I Postmasters had limited access to reports and data and limited knowledge regarding POL’s complex back-end systems. Their ability to investigate
discrepancies was therefore equally limited.

10 *27-36 I Fujitsu had the ability to insert, inject, edit, or delete transaction data or data in branch accounts without the knowledge or consent of Postmasters.

11 Permission controls upon the use of the remote access facility were considered inadequate. Whilst existing, the roles very wide and not controlled, including but
not limited to the lack of any proper logs.

12 Post Office and Fujitsu were unable to provide a clear and precise answer to what is, in essence, a very simple question, “How often was the remote and
privileged access facility utilised by POL and Fujitsu?”. This inability directly arises from Fujitsu's plainly inadequate records.

13 The design abilities of those with privileged access rights (i.e, APPSUP role) were very wide. Therefore, such facilities had the potential to affect the reliability of
a PM's branch accounts to a material extent.

14 ™37-40 I A Postmaster cannot dispute a discrepancy, or any figure on Horizon, or record on Horizon that they have raised a dispute.

15 Over 100,000 manual Transaction Corrections (TCs) have been issued each year since 2006 yet POL does not have comprehensive records of how many have
been challenged by Postmasters. Transaction Acknowledgments (TAs) are also used to make corrections to branch accounts, but a Postmaster has no option
but to accept them.

GA opinion

Comments

Based on an external review performed by KPMG
(KPMG Report June 2021-Horizon Review Report V4.2
FINAL pdf) itis evident from their report that 62 KELs
existed of which:

- 45 were closed.

- 14 required testing; and

- 3 were undetermined.

- Balance remaining 11 requiring testing.
(Completeness of KELs therefore demonstrated via the
KPMG report).

The 11 requiring testing are supported by a Test Closure
report (POL Test Closure Report-Historical KELS v0.6
15/06/21) which indicates all 11 KELs passed their
testing.

GAP:

1) POL Test Closure Report-Historical KELS v0.6
15/06/21 remains unsigned by the POL Horizon
IT Director and POL Head of Postmaster
Experience.

2) Further to the above The Historical KELs
Determination and Closure Report v0.5 dated
28/06/2021 has also not been signed off by the
POL Horizon IT Director, POL Head of QA and
POL Head of Postmaster Experience.

3) Underlying supporting data does not
necessarily convey in a simple, complete, and
aligned manner the same conclusion therefore,
GA opinion heavily contingent on KPMP report.

4) Governance applied is unclear.

Defects are logged and tracked within ServiceNow.
GAP:
However, the Horizon Problems Monthly Report - April
2024.pptx (sharepoint.com) indicates several SLA's (5 of
7) not being met such as:
« Branch notified within 5 days of identification.
* Knowledge Article created within 5 days of
identification.
© — Criticality scored within 5 days of initial

* Create impact statement within 5 days of initial

* Meeting held to discuss problem within 5 days of
identification.
The report is dated April 2024 and does not provide
trending or relative benchmarks. (Linked to HIJ005).

Defects criticality is defined and assessed, including
prioritisation carried out accordingly.

Potential Exposure: From the evidence, it is unclear
how the criticality score is reached, how the weighting
has been agreed, and who are the stakeholders that
reach the decision and whether this is recorded
anywhere.

The PowerPoint-Post Office & AppDynamics Full Stack
Observability - Technical Success Criteria 24th May
2022- clearly shows a Pilot was run and what the
success criteria were. However, it is not evident from the
PPT that the "Pilot covered 107 counters and 20 Horizon
Servers".

A change request form provided indicates Pilot to
include 110. And further the Pilot close email indicates
113 Counters. Change Request File Name:
CRQ000000350826 and Email AppDynamics
Closure.msg.

Whilst it is clear the deployment occurred; the evidence
provided, comprises multiple folders (8 folders, 2 have
12 subfolders and 5 contain 14 files), which are not
knitted together to provide or support an objective
opinion on whether a deployment covered 4836
Counters and outcomes. Linked to HIJ010.

The evidence provided clearly indicates that
considerable diligence was performed to assess status
and changes needed for reference data in the KPMG
Report Horizon AP-ADC Scripts and Reference Data
Solution 2021. In addition, the PowerPoint- Horizon
Improvements Programme-Reference Data Logical
Model, highlights several rulesets were created for
Reference data. That said it is challenging to assess how
this was embedded in a consistent and standardised
manner and the governance applied to the KPMG
recommendations.

Evidence provided highlights the following Gaps:

14) POL Test Strategy document does not indicate an
approval date; document review dates are all TBC;
Section 8 Test Activities Summaries is work in
progress; Section 11.1.8 Operational Acceptance
Testing is TBC; Section 14.3 is missing; Section 16
Test Roles & Responsibilities is TBC.

2) HSI Test Strategy V.04 (Old)- this still clearly a work
in progress (no approval, outstanding POL
comments) hence unclear how this supports HIJ
commitment.

3) The Regression Test Cycle report (71.20-
Regression Test Cycle 1 Daily Metrics Report
20220304) it is unclear why certain tests are not
‘executed and why this is not highlighted in the
Executive Summary.

Whilst both test strategy documents are comprehensive,
outlining the overview of the strategy to be employed for
testing, the significant gaps above could be interpreted
that neither has been formalised, completed nor signed
off.

Evidence provided does support business self-
assessment.

Technology provided 4 documents to support their
status. From these documents it is clear that a Horizon
Solution Authority (HSA) existed however the
information provided lacks data/insight on what was
brought to HSA, what changes were approved/rejected
over a period of time and consequently GA cannot
support technologies assessment.

Evidence provided whilst clearly showing significant
analysis and work being done to identify Problem
Statements (see Master Sprint Plan and Backlog

to the statement made i.e. “147 User and Data Journeys
developed and 39 system improvements”. In addition,
the lineage of Problem Statements to current state is
unclear including governance applied there to.

Evidence provided far exceeds the 4 topics mentioned
for Horizon Improvements.

Whilst it is very clear a number of Horizon Improvements
have been completed, with a number In Progress, it is
not possible to opine on, based on the evidence
provided, what impact the changes have had on
reducing discrepancies and Postmaster Detriment.

However, within the Migration Readiness Checklist (1) VO.1xIs
it is a challenge to understand the completeness of the 36
