Dear Sirs

Mohammad Afzal
Sub-Post Office, 119 Ferry Road, Edinburgh

Thank you for your letter dated 20 March 2012. Our apologies for the
delay in responding.

Your client is under a clear contractual obligation to make good the losses
claimed from him. We refer you to the terms of his appointment in that
regard. Post Office Ltd’s position remains these losses are due and owing
and that your client is required to make good. By failing to do so, your
client is in breach of contract.

We note that your client attributes those losses to “the failure of Post
Oftice Limited’s software system with Fujitsu”. This allegation is
completely unsubstantiated and is without any merit.

In the absence of your client providing a full and proper substantiated
explanation setting out the basis on which he is not required to comply
with his obligations, Post Office Ltd intends to proceed to deduct these
losses from his remuneration.

Your client’s contract advisor is Brian Trotter. This information will be
known to your client.

Dear Marilyn

Re Ferry Road Branch Discrepancy

I’ve looked at this again in conjunction with Service Delivery in respect
of the calls to the NBSC and Fujitsu in relation to the connectivity
problems experienced by the branch over the period in question.

You and Mr Afzal are quite correct that I have no evidence to support my
suggestion that the losses could be due to an incorrect application of the
recovery process

Mr Afzal has claimed that payments have been made to customers but the
transactions have not been recorded on Horizon. There is no evidence
that we can find to support this. I can understand that Mr Afzal’
customers who have benefited from these payments may not wish to
report (or even be aware of) their accounts not being debited by their
transaction. Ii does feel likely that, under such a scenario, in payments
would be similarly affected. Here customerrwould not have had bills paid
or accounts credited. I would expect ther to have alerted the branch to
an issue by this point.

We would certainly raise an urgent investigation if we became aware of
customers holding valid Horizon receipts where the relevant client has no
record of the transaction.

I can see 900 Special 1 class stamps being successfully remitted into the
branch on 28" September. I’ve checked with our stock team and they
cannot see any issues that appear to require resolution at the branch. It

may be that an earlier attempt to rem in the stamps failed but was later
POL00090726
POL00090726

completed. Therefore there should be no discrepancy arising from the
remittance ~assuming there was only one in this period.

l appreciate that even short periods of connectivity problems can cause
difficulty for branches in terms of customer service. However neither
Service Delivery nor I can see any reason why the Horizon system would
have caused losses for this branch. In the absence of any examples of
specific transactions being identified it is difficult to determine how to
investigate further.

Unfortunately I cannot offer relief to branches who suffer losses due to
comnectivity problems.

Dear Mr Afzal
Re Branch Discrepancy

I’m sorry but I don’t think I can assist you any further. The process for
disputing losses is via the helpline. As far as I can see there is no
evidence of Horizon failure been presented which would generate an
investigation.

There are processes in place for branches to manage any losses of
connectivity. This does not represent Horizon failure and the business
has been very clear that it will not compensate losses do to connectivity
breakdown.

As such I cannot su

Dear Mr Afzal

Re Branch Discrepancy

Pm sorry to learn that your branch has experienced connectivity problems
in September. I'm afraid 1 don’t think I am going to be able to help you.

Some transactions will never be recoverable e.g. stamp sales whilst
others, e.g. card account withdrawals will be recoverable dependent upon
the point at which the cormmunications broke down. I appreciate it is
difficult to know where you are if communications are lost,

However there is a general principle that if a transaction receipt has not
been produced by Horizon, the transaction has not completed and cash
should not change hands until you are certain of the transaction status.
Clearly if recovery takes a period of time, the customer may have left, If
the transaction is seen to be recoverable, the option not to proceed with
recovery should be chosen.

Unfortunately [ am not able to offer any relief to branches who may not
have followed recovery procedures in full.

Yours sincerely

Dear Andy

RE: FERRY ROAD POST OFFICE, BRANCH DISCREPANCY

I would refer to the Branch Discrepancy notice issued fo Mr Afzal of Ferry Road Post Office,
1446242, on 26 September 2011, for the sum of £1,427.85.

I believe that you are already aware of the background to this case and how Mr Afzal suffered
intermittent Horizon connectivity problems over a periad from 16 September 2011 to 23 September
2011. Despite Mr Afzal’s continued endeavours in reporting this to the Helpline and Fujitsu
engineers calling cn the 16° and the 20" the problem continued through until the 23°.

During this period Mr Afzal would declare cash daily and print a balance snapshot but on the 20" (a
day of many problems, with the engineer on site) he discovered a shortage which he reported to the
helpline. On the following day, the 21° a similar range of problems were experienced and a
shortage of £1,427.86 identified, During the same period Mr Afzal also remitted in stamps received
from Post Office Limited (900 special 1°) but this was reiected from the system.

lam aware from our conversation that you have already considered this case in some detail and
may believe that the losses may de as a result of Mr Afzal not following recovery procedures where
a transaction fails because of a communication/systems breakdown. There is however nothing to
indicate that Mr Afzal failed in this regard, nor that money was necessarily handed over before a
transaction was completed and status confirmed. The intermittent and continuing nature of the
problem undoubtedly creates difficulties and there is also the matter of the rejected siamo
remittance.

I would be grateful if you could reconsider this balance discrepancy in the circumstances with a view
fo granting some relief. I understand that there is a service delivery issue involved in this matter in
addition to branch accounting and have therefore copied this latter to Dave Hulbert for his
consideration also.

I look forward to hearing from you (and/or Dave Hulbert) in due course.

Yours sincerely

You can see from the information below, that on the day the Postmaster states he first saw the loss
he reported that the branch were off line at 8.57arn official branch hours state the branch opens at
Sam, so no transactions should have taken place at this pcint. The Postmaster reported a 1k loss to
NBSC on the 20' September @ 27.51. They balanced on the 21° September and logged a call with
NBSC to say they had a discrepancy who fellowed all correct procedures with the branch to try and
help resolve the loss in branch.

NBSC were correctly used as the point of escalation by the branch. NBSC Rernedy shows that they
