Subject: Chairman's Sparrow Review & comms issues -

Dear all,

With the Chairman’s review of Sparrow between now and Christmas, the key communications issues we will be
managing as part of the plan, some of which will become live quite quickly, are:

- That the ‘review’ is positioned by JFSA and other parties as a ‘fresh investigation’ (and demonstrates Chairman
and/or Minister not satisfied with work done previously e.g. implied criticism potentially of Paula)

- That it will be used as a delaying tactic by applicants with date set for mediation (or cause complete
withdrawals)

- It becomes a ‘hook’ for further media/ parliamentary activity

- There is criticism about additional cost (of lawyers)

It is also likely of course that Arbuthnot’s scepticism about the review will be repeated and that there will be accusations
about ‘another sham’ and pressure for the review to provide something ‘new’. There will be anticipation of the
Chairman’s ‘report’ (and associated noise about it).

lam therefore working up key messages and Qs and As for use with media, politicians and also Scheme applicants.

These will centre on the message that Tim Parker, as part of his duties and responsibilities as the new Chairman, is
looking, independently, at what the company has done regarding the handling of the complaints.

I will send a draft round for comment asap.

Mel
