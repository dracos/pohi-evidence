A closer look at....... ‘Be Curious’

Ask the questions you think need to be asked and push for the truth if you ever think

it is missing

Observable behaviours
+ We are inclusive of others, exploring and appreciating alternative views
and opinions

information and encourage “deep curiosity”

+ We bring wisdom, insight and bold thinking to the table

+ We display courage to try out new things and create opportunities
for others to do the same

+ We display self-led curiosity to problem solve, without assuming we
know the answer from experience

+ We speak openly, listen, challenge and ask questions to protect the
integrity of the business

+ We encourage and create a safe environment for innovation,
exploration, learning and understanding
