Purpose of Summit

This summit will bring together employees, from different backgrounds, tenures, ethnicities, genders, sexual orientations,
disabilities, ages and seniority across the business. Colleagues will represent network groups, Senior Leaders and SMEs
from employee lifecycle stages and other business areas.

The role of these people will be to share their insights and perceptions of what it personally means to work at Post Office,
how current initiatives are progressing from their viewpoint and what they think would be good for us to prioritise.

Each member will provide feedback and insights to inform the ED8d roadmap including its strategy, key themes,
deliverables, milestones, and goals; effectively become a “think tank" for ED& and an accountability partner for the action
plans.

Summit attendees will support with the implementation of the ED8d agenda, providing two-way feedback to the business
areas they represent. Encouraging wider participation with ED8U such as events and surveys.

The Chair of the Summit will take away insights, review the suggestions in line with the ED8d strategy and define what is
possible, and share this back with the summit.

Update on ED&I Strategy

A great strategy isn’t just about following rules; it's about building a culture where everyone can thrive and add to the success of the
organisation. By accessing diverse perspectives, talents and experiences, this strategy aims to eradicate bias and discrimination, boost morale
and engagement, attract and retain talent, and improve the overall performance and reputation of Post Offic.

In November 2023 we completed a maturity assessment with Grant Thornton across the following areas:

+ Talent at
- Ti

tion (employer brand, recruitment and selection, employee onboarding experiences)

int development (approach to talent and careers, pathways to progression, learning and development, reward and benefits)
+ Culture (ways of working, psychological safety, inclusive environment across demographics, role modelling inclusive behaviour)
+ Strategic development (communication, EDA strategy embedded, understanding our purpose, clarity of vision for ED&d)

+ External impact (approach in driving £081 externally which aligns to the values)

This benchmark places us as ‘characteristic focused’
