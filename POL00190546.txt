Thanks for all the comments on the letter. I have attached a third draft which I hope is final. It has added an important
section on the exceptions which I need clearing and comments from all those copied, tonight or first thing tomorrow if
possible please (and sorry).

I also need to know if we have agreed the definition of Horizon point with SS?

Hi Mark

A couple of suggested style edits, but content is looking good.
