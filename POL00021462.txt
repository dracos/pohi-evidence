1) The information presented to Postmasters regarding their customer
accounts.

2) The trends prevalent or emerging in Postmaster customer accounts.

3) Any other processes/products that can be reviewed which would give
rise to similar issues to those identified with stamps.

7.2

Regarding Postmasters accounts, TP advised these are settled centrally at
the end of a trading period and that branches are expected to complete
trading period accounting 12 times a year on a 5-week, 4-week, 4-week
schedule at the end of each trading period.

Site visits, increased monitoring and support has reduced the need for

chaser letters to be sent out, and all revised processes and letters have
been independently reviewed

A thorough review of POL’s Loss Recovery policies and processes is now
underway, and consideration is being given to other opportunities, such
as the use of Branch Hub, to allow Postmasters to monitor the balances
on their customer account(s). This review will conclude in Q3 2020-21.

7.3

With regards to trends, the year on year balances settled centrally by
branches has fallen in each trading period over the last 20 months. The
reduction in balances settled centrally is driven by a reduction in both the
volume of branches settling balances centrally and the average value
being settled centrally.

TC believed the balances settled per branch was high and could be
reduced. The Chair requested that ways to reduce balances should be
investigated and it was agreed that an update would be provided to the
Committee in January 2021.

Action:
TPE

7.4

In terms of reviewing similar products that could be considered at risk
similar to stamps, no further products/processes had been identified.
However, TP remarked that a high-level review of the product portfolio
would be conducted instead, reviewing current and historical processes
where known.

The Chair recognised that governance had improved since last year, but
recommended that she, NR and Declan Salter (GLO Director) have
conversations to establish clear governance structures prior to the next
Committee meeting. Additionally, a process is required where a chaser
letter is sent to a Postmaster regarding their balances, which is then
disputed.
