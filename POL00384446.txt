Hi

Please can we think of ways of building the lines below in relation to my points in caps:

* We are concerned at the length of time it is taking to investigate cases and we want to complete this process
quickly so that applicants can fully understand what happened in their case. [S;0? YOU MADE YOUR BED, LIE
ON IT]

* Having investigated 26 of the 70 cases submitted it has now become clear that the Scheme will not work in the
interests of those who have submitted cases [WHY?]

Thanks for capturing — as discussed I think this will be helpful to give them a thorough understanding of the Horizon
landscape.

I think we have quite a bit of this info already but it would be great if we could get it over to Craig at Brunswick just
before the 4.30 meeting.

Thank you
Nina

Hi,
When we met earlier we discussed getting a pack to Brunswick based on what we already have. I have outlined below
what we may need to send over to them — if your name is against an item please send it to be in one email asap so I
can collate.

Once I have everything in one folder I will let you know so that Mark and Nina you can send over to Brunswick (if you
want to).
