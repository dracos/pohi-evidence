Nick , Good advice from Clare to keep
off the emails - getting the same
advice here ! am being questioned
about outrageous charges against you
by Jane . Just wanted to reassure you
but of course it can wait until Monday .
Do spend time with your lawyer - it
reassured me .

Henry,

What a week. I very much hope you are
bearing up. I can’t begin to imagine
what you have been going through...
However, I was pleased to see a more
balanced piece by Ollie Shah in the
Sunday Times today.

For what it is worth colleagues were

absolutely horrified by the manner of
your departure. Politics at its very

worst.
I hope you are able to put it behind you
and move on.
Best wishes to Karen from Clare and I,
too.
