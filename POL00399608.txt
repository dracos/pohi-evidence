Report Introduction

On completion of the PCI DSS ASV Scans conducted for Post Office Limited, NCC Group is pleased to present the findings in this report. This report aims to concisely
outline the results collected during testing and to define specific actions Post Office Limited may take in order to mitigateissues identified and bring the systems in line with
the PCI DSS requirements.

Definitions of Risk Ratings

NCC Group have adopted the Common Vulnerability Scoring System. CVSS is a vendor independent, industry open standard. It is designed to convey vulnerability severity,
help determine urgency and priority of response. The table below gives a key to the icons and symbols used through this report to provide aclear and concise risk scoring
system.

It is designed to convey vulnerability severity, help determine urgency and priority of response. The table below gives a key to the icons and symbols used through this
report to provide a clear and concise risk scoring system.

It should be stressed that the overall business risk posed by any of the issues found in any test is outside our remt. This means that some risk may be reported as high from
a technical perspective but may, as a result of other controls unknown to us, be considered acceptable.

PCI ASV Scanning Methodology

NCC Group performed an ASV scan of the scoped network infrastructure and applications. Specifically the work included:

Discovery and network footprint phase; using scanning tools to locate live hosts, services and web applications within target IP range. Techniques and coverage
include but are not limited to

Common UDP and full 65535 TCP Port Scanning — Service enumeration is conducted using port scanning tools such as NMAP with advanced settings to ensure
maximum service detection including:

= Stack fingerprinting and TCP sequence prediction to identify operating systems and services
» Public Service banner Identification
= Network Mapping

Network layer testing of all live hosts and services identified with focus on the follow areas -

Routers and Firewalls
Operating Systems
DNS and Mail servers
Databases and Web servers
Application Servers
Patching Issues
Common Services
Wireless Access Points
SSL/TLS

Backdoors

Remote Access

OWASP Top 10 and other advanced web application layer testing, including Point of Sale Software, with a specific focus on thefollowing areas:-

= SQL Injection
= Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Default Passwords

Provision of high-level management and detailed technical reports, including a compliance status statement and recommendations for improvement
No buffer overflow or brute force testing was carried out which could result in denial of service conditions or use of excessive bandwidth.

Vulnerabilities Noted for Each IP

The table below outlines all identified vulnerabilities for each scanned host along with the risk of said vulnerability.
Please see the vulnerability details section regarding CVSS Score amendment notes when Exceptions, False Positives, or Compensating Controls have been provided to
the ASV.

Please note that Denial of Service (DoS) issue are reported below as required however these are not marked as a Fail asper the PCI ASV programme guidelines. However
it is strongly recommended that all DoS issues be addressed to further enhance the security of your network perimeter. One exception to not recording DoS issues as a PCI
ASV FAIL is where a DoS issue is co-present with another separate significant issue for a given vulnerability single vulnerability. By way of an example in several
vulnerabilities a DoS issue or a Remote Code Execution issue may be possible a outcome for the identified single vulnerability. In this example case as remote code
execution is also possible as an alternative to the DoS outcome the issue remains in force, there are many other examples whee DoS issues co-exist as outcomes with
other significant weaknesses as described above and in these cases they will be recorded as a PCI ASV FAIL.

_ Description

I The remote host responded to an ICMP timestamp request. The ICMP timestamp response contains the remote host's date and time. This informatio n__
could theoretically be used against some systems to exploit weak time -based random number generators in other services. In additi on, the versions of
some operating systems can be accurately fingerprinted by analyzing their responses to invalid ICMP timestamp requests.

I HP-UX
Execute the following command: ndd -set /deviip ip_respond_to_timestamp_broadcast 0 The easie st and most effective solution is to configure your
firewall to block incoming and outgoing ICMP packets with ICMP types 13 (timestamp request) and 14 (timestamp response).

Cisco 10S

Use ACLs to block ICMP types 13 and 14. For example: deny icmp any any 13 deny icmp any any 14 Note that it is generally pref erable to use ACLs
that block everything by default and then selectively allow certain types of traffic in. For example, block eve rything and then only allow ICMP I
unreachable, ICMP echo reply, ICMP time exceeded, and ICMP source quench: permit icmp any any unreachable permit iomp any any echo-reply
permit icmp any any time-exceeded permit icmp any any source -quench The easiest and most effective solution is to configure your firewall to block
incoming and outgoing ICMP packets with ICMP types 13 (timestamp request) and 14 (timestamp response).

SGI Irix

IRIX does not offer a way to disable ICMP timestamp responses. Therefore, you should block ICMP on the affected host using ipfilterd, and/or block it
I at any external firewalls. The easiest and most effective solution is to configure your firewall to block incoming and outgoi_ng ICMP packets with ICMP
types 13 (timestamp request) and 14 (timestamp response) I

Linux

Linux offers neither a sysct! nor a /proc/sys/net/ipv4 interface to disable ICMP timestamp responses. Therefore, you should b lock ICMP on the
affected host using iptables, and/or block it at the firewall. For exa mple: ipchains -A input -p icmp ~icmp-type timestamp-request -I DROP ipchains -A
output -p iomp —iomp-type timestamp-reply -j DROP The easiest and most effective solution is to configure your firewall to block incoming and

outgoing ICMP packets with ICMP types 13 (timestamp request) and 14 (timestamp response).

Microsoft Windows NT, Microsoft Windows NT Workstation, Microsoft Windows NT Server, Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, Mi crosoft
Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition, Microsoft Windows NT Server, Terminal Server Edition

Windows NT 4 does not provide a way to block ICMP packets, Therefore, you should block them at the firewall. The easiest and _ most effective
solution is to configure your firewall to block incoming and outgoing ICMP packets with ICMP types 13 (timestamp re quest) and 14 (timestamp
response).

I OpenBSD

Set the “net inet icmp.tstamprepl" sysctl variable to 0. sysct!_-w net.inet.iomp.tstamprepI=0 The easiest and most effective solution is to configure your
firewall to block incoming and outgoing ICMP pac kets with ICMP types 13 (timestamp request) and 14 (timestamp response).

Cisco PIX

A properly configured PIX firewall should never respond to ICMP packets on its external interface. In PIX Software versions 4 .1(6) until 5.2.1, ICMP I
traffic to the PIX's internal interface is permitted; the PIX cannot be configured to NOT respond, Beginning in PIX Software version 5.2.1, ICMP is stil
permitted on the internal interface by default, but ICMP responses from its internal interfaces can be disabled with the icmp command, as follows,

Where <inside> is the name of the internal interface: iomp deny any 13 <inside> icmp deny any 14 <inside> Don't forget to sav e the configuration
When you are finished. See Cisco's support document (http:/uww.cisco.com/warp/pu blic/110/31.html) Handling ICMP Pings with the PIX Firewall for
more information. The easiest and most effective solution is to configure your firewall to block incoming and outgoing ICMP p ackets with ICMP types

13 (timestamp request) and 14 (timestamp re sponse) I

‘Sun Solaris

Execute the following commands: /usr/sbin/ndd -set /devlip ip_respond_to_timestamp 0 /usr/sbin/ndd -set /dev/ip
ip_respond_to_timestamp_broadcast 0 The easiest and most effective solution is to configure your firewall to block incoming and outgoing ICMP
packets with ICMP types 73 (timestamp request) and 14 (timestamp response).

Microsoft Windows 2000, Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional, Microsoft Windows 2000 Server, Microsoft Windows 2000 Advanced S erver,
Microsoft Windows 2000 Datacenter Server

Use the IPSec filter feature to define and apply an IP filter list that blocks ICMP types 13 and 14. Note that the standard TCP/IP blocking capability
under the "Networking and Dialup Connections” control panel is NOT capable of blocking ICMP (only TCP and UDP). The IPSec fil ter features, while
they may seem strictly related to the IPSec standards, will allow you to selectively block these ICMP packets. See
