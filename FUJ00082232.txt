WITNESS STATEMENT OF ANDY DUNKS

1, ANDY DUNKS of Fujitsu, Lovelace Road, Bracknell, Berkshire, RG12 8SN WILL SAY
as follows:

1. lam an Information Technology Security Analyst at Fujitsu Services Limited. I am
authorised to make this statement on behalf of Post Office Limited, the Defendant
in these proceedings.

2. The facts set out in this statement are within my own knowledge, or if they are
outside my knowledge, I have explained the source of my information or belief.

3. I have been employed by Fujitsu Services Limited, on the POA (Post Office
Account), since 11 March 2002 as an Information Technology (IT) Security
Analyst responsible for audit data extractions and IT Security. I have working
knowledge of the computer system known as Horizon, which is a computerised
accounting system used by Post Office Ltd. I am authorised by Fujitsu Services
Limited to undertake extractions of audit archived data and to obtain information
regarding system transactions recorded on the Horizon system.

4. During 2009/2010 the Horizon system was upgraded to Horizon HNGX and the
detail contained in this witness statement refers to audited transaction records
generated by this upgraded Horizon HNGX system. Unless I state otherwise in
this statement when I subsequently refer to the “Horizon System” I am referring to
the Horizon system as upgraded by Horizon HNGX.

When information relating to individual transactions is requested, the data is
extracted from the audit archive media of the Horizon System via the Audit
Workstations (AWs). Information is presented in exactly the same way as the data
held in the archive although it can be filtered depending upon the type of
information requested. The integrity of data retrieved for audit purposes is
guaranteed at all times from the point of gathering, storage and retrieval to
subsequent despatch to the person making the request. Controls have been
established that provide assurances to Post Office Internal Audit (POIA) that this
integrity is maintained.

During audit data extractions the following controls apply :

Extractions can only be made through the AWs which exist at Fujitsu Services
Limited, Lovelace Lane, Bracknell, Berkshire and Fujitsu Services Limited, 14
Cavendish Road Stevenage. These two sites are both subject to rigorous
physical security controls appropriate to each location. All AWs are located in a
secure room subject to proximity pass access.

Logical access to the AW and its functionality is managed in accordance with the
Fujitsu Services Limited's POA Security Policy and the principles of ISO 27001.
This includes dedicated Logins, password control and the use of 2-factor access
control.

All extractions are logged on the AW and supported by documented Audit Record
Queries (ARQs), authorised by nominated persons within Post Office Ltd. This
log can be scrutinised on the AW.

Extractions are only made by authorised individuals.
The required files are identified and marked using the dedicated audit tools.

Checksum seals are calculated for audit data files when they are written to audit

archive media and re-calculated when the files are retrieved.

The files are copied to the AW where they are checked and converted into the file
type required.

Digital signatures that were generated at the time that messages were originally
sent from the counters to the Data Centre are checked as being correct.

Checks are made using the JSN that all audited messages for each counter in the
Branch have been retrieved and that no messages are missing.

System events generated when the transactions at the branch were recorded are
checked to ensure the system was functioning correctly.

The retrieved audit data is encrypted using PGP encryption.

The requested information is copied onto removable CD media and virus checked
using the latest software.

A request was received on 3rd Oct 2018 and asked for information in connection
with the Post Offices at Caddington, Spencefield, Newport and Fleckney. A
further request was received on 29 October for information in connection with the
Post Offices at Sandsacre, Cottingley, Lenzie, Barkham and Charlton. I undertook
extractions of data held on the Horizon System and followed the procedure
outlined above. I produced a CD containing the required data. No data was
provided for Alan Bates as this information was too old to have been retained,
and in the case of Mohammad Sabir, the issues related to the Cottingley branch
and therefore the information provided was specifically in relation to this branch
only.

There is no reason to believe that the information in this statement is inaccurate
because of the improper use of the system. To the best of my knowledge and
belief at all material times the system was operating properly, or if not, any
respect in which it was not operating properly, or was out of operation was not
such as to effect the information held within it.

Any records to which I refer in my statement form part of the records relating to
the business of Fujitsu Services Limited. These were compiled during the
ordinary course of business from information supplied by persons who have, or
may reasonably be supposed to have, personal knowledge of the matter dealt
with in the information supplied, but are unlikely to have any recollection of the
information or cannot be traced. As part of my duties, I have access to these
records.
