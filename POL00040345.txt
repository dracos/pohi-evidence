Dear Ms Williams

“an essential part of everyday life” www.postoffice.co.uk

Thank you for your letter of 23" December 2003, addressed to Allan
Leighton, enclosing a copy of a letter from your constituent Alan Bates -
ex-subpostmaster at Post Office®, Craig-y-don branch.

Mr Bates raises a number of issues, many of which were addressed in
my letter of 18* December. I stand by all the points I made in that letter.

! also stand by my comment that at the heart of Mr Bates' concerns is
his belief that the Horizon system is corrupt. A position substantiated, I
believe, by the comments Mr Bates makes on his website

postofficevictims.org.uk

These things said, Mr Bates quite obviously has a deep-seated belief
that he has been treated unjustly by Post Office Ltd. In an attempt to
bring this matter to a conclusion, I am asking an independent member
of my senior management team - Sandy Stephen, Head of Area for
Scotland - to review the case in its entirety.

I will write to you again once that review has been completed.

Yours sincerely

General Manager, Commercial Network
