|, Jayne Elizabeth Faith Sullivan-Hemes, will say as follows...

INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND

1. My memory isnâ€™t the best but as far as | can remember | was part of the
Regional Horizon Team. | had nothing to do with the training or day to day
running of Horizon but | believe that my, and the team | worked with, main
responsibility was to get the offices ready to have the equipment installed into
offices that had slipped the timetable for whatever reasons. We would look at
any modifications that the office needed or checked that the postmaster was
willing to go ahead as he might have re fusecearlier on for some reason. We
would also arrange to get one of the field team (Not an HFSO) to visit the

office if there was any way that they could clarify what was holding up the

installation.
