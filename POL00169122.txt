Hi Penny

The legal advice is that logs should be analysed for the whole of the false accounting period. I have been
informed that this is from December 06 to December 07.

Mark/Jon
Of course, I’ll help all I can.

Are you sure you need 12 months, Jon? It’s not just the retrieving, it’s the analysis that will take the
time (by Gareth) and frankly, I don’t think we will be able to achieve this in the time left.

Penny, we need a massive favour that I'm sure will cost us quite a few cream cakes.

Is there anything you can do to pull out the stops to provide what Jon is looking for within the timescales.
Maureen will provide the necessary paper work on Monday.

Thank you for considering this.

Mark

Jarnail has just telephoned me and asked me to get transaction log data for the above PO from Ist December
2006 to 31st December 2007. The logs need to be ordered through our current process and then given to Gareth
Jenkins at Fujitsu to analyse and confirm by witness statement whether there are any errors within the Horizon
system for the transaction log period. Jarnail would like the statement by Friday Sth March 2010.
