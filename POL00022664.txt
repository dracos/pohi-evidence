We had a lengthy discussion on this, and all steering committee members felt this was the best outcome. The
sensitivity relates to transparency and whether we could be challenged for under-stating a potential risk. This wording
reflects similar wording used in the previous paragraph in relation to balancing transactions (full text on remote access
attached ~ see para 1.3.4), and needs to be read in conjunction with para 1.4 as well.

The wording is being reviewed by Counsel, and checked with both Deloitte and FJ.

Just came out of a meeting with all the legal folk. This is the final wording proposed.

1.1.1 Administer access to databases. Database and server access and edit permission is provided, within
strict controls (including logging user access), to a small, controlled number of specialist Fujitsu (not
Post Office) administrators. As far as we are currently aware, privileged administrator access has not
been used to alter branch transaction data. We are seeking further assurance from Fujitsu on this
point.
