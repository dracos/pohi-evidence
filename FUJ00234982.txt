CONFIDENCE)

1. Introduction

1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this Post Office Account incident procedural document is solely to supplement the
incident processes defined in the Fujitsu EMEIA Business Management Systems Incident Procedure with
any Post Office Limited specific requirements or requests.

This document outlines the management guidelines to be used for Incidents impacting the live estate in
communicating with Post Office Limited.

1.2 Owner

The owner of the Incident Management process at the local POA level is the Fujitsu POA Senior Service
Delivery Manager.

1.3 Objective

For the purpose of this document an Incident is defined as:

“Any event which is not part of the standard operation of a service and which causes, or may cause, an
interruption to, or a reduction in, the quality of that service.”

The quality of the service includes the protection of the confidentiality of business, personal and card data
as defined by the POA Information Security Policy (SVM/SEC/POL/0003).

The document applies to all Incidents raised by the POA MAC or by SMC (out of hours or from systems
monitoring tools), where they are related to the Fujitsu outsourcing contract. N.B calls presented to POA
MAC / SMC that should be placed with the POL Service Desk are transferred/ referred from POA MAC /
SMC to Post Office Service Desk.

The scope of the process is from the receipt of an incident by the MAC / SMC, through to the successful
resolution of the incident (or providing a workaround).

For clarity, it should be noted that the MAC team are responsible for managing/owning Incidents between
08.00 and 20.00 Monday to Friday, 08.00 to 17.00 Saturday and Bank Holidays 0800 — 1400 excluding
Christmas Day. The SMC assume this responsibility out of hours, i.e., outside these hours. The SMC are
responsible for escalation of incidents to the POA OOH Duty Manager.

The key objectives of the process are:

Log, track and close all types of incident requests

Respond to all types of incident requests

Restore agreed service to the business as soon as possible

Resolve incidents within the target timescales set for each priority level within the Service Level
Agreement(s)

Resolve a high number of requests at first contact

Ensuring incident priorities are linked to business priorities

Keeping the user informed of progress

Reduced unplanned downtime

Improved Customer satisfaction

POA Operations Incident Management Procedure

FUJITSU

FUJITSU RESTRICTED (COMMERCIAL IN
CONFIDENCE)

The primary goal of the Incident Management process is to restore normal service operation as quickly
as possible, thereby minimising adverse impact to the business. In turn, this ensures the highest level of
service quality and availability. Normal service operation is defined here as service operation within
Service Level Targets (SLT).

Demonstrating a professional approach to, and Post Office Limited (the customer) and their clients.

1.5 Mandatory Guidelines

It is important to maintain a balance between:
a) Allowing the technical teams the right amount of time to diagnose and impact an incident
b) Avoiding unnecessary alerting of the customer
c) Assessing which incidents are major

The following guidelines should be adhered to.

* During the MAC Core Hours (Monday — Friday 08:00 — 20:00 and Saturday 08:00 — 17:00 and
Bank Holidays 0800 — 1400 excluding Christmas Day.) the MAC should be the first point of
operational contact between Fujitsu and the Post Office Service Desk. Outside these hours the
SMC acts as the first point of contact.

e Any activity detailed in this document which is assigned to the MAC is handed over to the SMC.
outside the MAC Core Hours.

2 = ‘Inputs

The inputs to this process are:

e Allincidents reported by Contact with the MAC / SMC. Contact is defined as voice, e-mail, incident
transfers over the HDI interface from Post Office Service Desk or Tivoli Alert as the methods of
communication with the MAC / SMC and fall into the following categories:

o Business process error

o Hardware or software error

o Request for information e.g. progress of a previously reported Incident
o User complaint

o Network Error

e Severity and SLT information.

¢ Evidence of an Error.

e System Alerts received automatically from transaction monitoring tools. Due to the urgent nature of
some of these alerts, they may be dealt with directly by SSC, with an update of workaround or
resolution supplied to MAC / SMC. It should be noted that these alerts enter the process at step
1.2.3, and are not subject to prior steps in 1.1 & 1.2 of this process.

e — Splunk will monitor the Azure environment and will be used by the SMC to identify incidents from
alerts. In the Full Azure Foundation Service Splunk will automatically raise incidents in TfSNow. It
should be noted that these automatically raised incidents enter the process at step 1.2.3, and are not
subject to prior steps in 1.1 & 1.2 of this process.

3 Risks and Dependencies

3.1. Risks

The following define the risks to the successful delivery of the process:

e Break in the communications chain to third parties. Mitigation is to invoke escalation procedures.

POA Operations Incident Management Procedure

FUJITSU RESTRICTED (COMMERCIAL IN
CONFIDENCE)

Non-availability of the MAC / SMC Incident Management System. Mitigation is given in the MAC /
SMC Business Continuity Plan.

Non-availability of the HDI interface with the POL Service Desk. Mitigation is via e-mail.
Non-availability of the OTI links to internal & external service desk tools. Mitigation is via e-mail.
Lack of information given to the MAC / SMC regarding changes, POL Business updates, request for
changes, status of Problems etc. Processes must be followed to lessen this risk, such as the
Change Management and Problem Management Processes.

Unavailability of sufficient support unit staff to investigate and resolve issues.

Unavailability of sufficient tools for Incident diagnosis whereby manual diagnostics are unable to
provide the same level of information as automated tooling.

Non-availability of KEL or call management systems. Mitigation is a secondary SSC server for KELs
and manual call processes.

The provision of inadequate staff training within the MAC / SMC, SDU'’s or 3” party suppliers.
Unavailability of systems for evidence gathering.

3.2 Dependencies

This process is dependent on:

Effective Incident handling by the MAC / SMC.

The known error information being available and kept up to date with all errors as the root cause
becomes known to Problem Management

Knowledge database kept up to date with POL business and services knowledge

Fujitsu infrastructure support of the MAC / SMC tools

Appropriate training plans / skills transfer

Appropriate training needs to include hardware, software and networks support staff, SDU's and 3%
party suppliers

e Effective routing of calls to SDUs and third parties

e Effective escalation procedures and the maintenance thereof within Fujitsu, POL and third parties

* Governance of Incident / Problem Management procedures

« Effective feedback to POL through Service Management SRFs, contributing to end user education
and reduced Incident rates.

e Internal feedback to improve the Incident / Management Process.

e SLT and OLA knowledge and understanding across all Fujitsu and 3 party support

e POA, SDU and 3" party consistent co-operation in incident identification and resolution.

Detailed Process and Procedure documentation

4.1 Roles

The main roles required by the process are:

e Incident Manager - To drive the Incident Management process, monitor its effectiveness and
make recommendations for improvement. The key objective is to ensure that service is improved

through the efficient resolution of Incidents.

« Major Account Controller - To provide a single point of contact for Post Office Service Desk,
dealing with the management of routine and non- routine Incidents, Problems and requests

e Incident Resolver - To accurately diagnose and resolve Incidents and to assess, plan, build/test
and implement Changes in accordance with the Change Management Process. This role will

typically be fulfilled by the support teams and service delivery units.

4.2 Incident Prioritisation within POA

The priority assigned to a TfSNow incident is either based on the priority documented in an existing KEL

or based upon the Urgency and Impact of the incident, refer to POA Incident Enquiry Matrix.

With the exceptions of Major Business Continuity Incidents and Major incidents POA generally utilise
three priorities for incidents based upon the following guidelines.

Consideration must also be given to if the incident being reported is a Security Incident, if it is it must be
classified and managed under the POA Operational Security process (See Appendix A for guidance).
Priority 1 where there is an immediate impact to any live service or potential security incident requiring
timely attention. Priority 1 incidents are voiced to a Support Delivery Unit, the POA Duty Manager and
the Post Office Service Desk.

Priority 3 where there is an infrastructure failure which has caused a loss of resilience or a failure or event

which needs the timely attention of a Support Delivery Unit whose team will be voiced.

Priority 5 for other less urgent incidents.

Note1: Generally Priority 2 and Priority 4 incidents are not utilised within POA. However, if there is a
genuine business reason to do so incidents may be allotted at these priorities when it is consistent with
EMEIA processes.

Note2: When incidents are transferred to the Software Support Centre (SSC) the TfSNow incident is
transferred into a Peak incident system. Within Peak the incident priorities are defined as A, B, C and D.
Therefore, when transferring TfSNow incidents into Peak ensure the following is adhered to:

TfSNow priority 1 equates to Peak priority A
TfSNow priority 2 equates to Peak priority B
TfSNow priority 3 equates to Peak priority C
TfSNow priorities 4 and 5 equates to Peak priority D

If this cannot be achieved through automation the MAC or SMC Agent undertaking the transfer is to log a
comment on the TfSNow incident stating the TfSNow and Peak priorities.

9 Appendix A: Security Incident Reporting

9.1 Scope

This annex contains guidance regarding the reporting and investigation of security incidents concerning
the HORIZON Network, POA and any Payment Brand incident (PCI) and/or GDPR breaches such as the
AMEX EPA files i.e. SSK not conforming to the Application Interface Specification due to naming or
encryption inconsistencies.

9.2 Aim

The aim of this guidance is to ensure that the reporting routes for Security Incidents are kept as simple as
possible and that investigations are managed in an efficient and auditable manner.

9.3 Changes

This guidance is primarily for use by the MAC team, the POA Security Team, the POL Security Team,
and SSC staff. The SecOps team also have their own work instructions for handling security incidents
and there is also an overarching Information Security Incident Management Procedure ISSC-11a.

All incident documentation is subject to review and update by the business continuity and information
security teams as part of the lessons learnt process following an incident and following the annual review
of the incident process as part of business continuity.

9.4 POL Incident Handling Guidance

All POL incidents will still be handled in accordance with existing POL guidelines. This document does
not replace these or, indeed, replace any part of the content rather it details POA guidance on handling
security incidents.

9.5 IT Incidents

9.5.1 Incident Definition

An information security Incident is: "an adverse event or series of events that compromises the
confidentiality, integrity or availability of Fujitsu Services Post Office Account information or information
technology assets, having an adverse impact on Fujitsu Services and/or Post Office Ltd reputation,
brand, performance or ability to meet its regulatory or legal obligations." This will also extend to include
assets entrusted to Fujitsu including data belonging to Post Office Ltd, its clients and its customers.

9.5.2 Incident Categories

Incidents can be categorised in many ways, they can occur alone or in combination with other incident
categories and can vary significantly in severity and impact. It is important that all incidents are
recognised and acted upon.

For the purpose of illustrating the impact of incidents two levels of severity have been defined (Note: in
practice the assessment may be less straightforward):

A MINOR incident will normally have limited and localised impact and be confined to one domain,
resulting in one or more of the following:

e Loss or unauthorised disclosure of internal or sensitive material leading to minor
exposure, or minor damage of reputation

e Loss of integrity within the system application or data, leading minimal damage of
reputation; minimal loss of customer / supplier / stakeholder confidence; negligible cost of
recovery

e Loss of service availability within the domain, leading to reduced ability to conduct
business as usual; negligible loss of revenue; minimal loss of customer / supplier /
stakeholder confidence; negligible cost of recovery

e Individual attempts to breach network security controls shall be treated as a minor
security breach.

e Subject to discussions with the POA Duty Manager due to high volume of calls relating to
the same type of incident it may well be a requirement to follow the POA Major Incident
Process (SVM/SDM/PRO/0001) following the advice from the POA Duty Manager.

A MAJOR incident will have a significant impact on the Network Banking Automation Community
resulting in one of more of the following:

e Loss or unauthorised disclosure of confidential or strictly confidential material, leading to
brand or reputation damage; legal action by employees, clients, customers, partners or
other external parties

« Loss of integrity of the applications or data, leading to brand or reputation damage; loss
of customer / supplier / client confidence; cost of recovery

e Loss of service availability for applications or communications networks, leading to an
inability to conduct business as usual; loss of revenue; loss of customer / supplier / client
confidence; cost of recovery

e Aconcerted attempt or a successful breach of network security controls shall be treated
as a major security breach.

e Breach of Data Protection Legislation — inclusive of the GDPR, the Privacy and
Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003 and all other Applicable Law
in respect of data protection and data privacy including any applicable guidance or codes
of practice that are issued by the Information Commissioner, Working Party 29 and/or the
European Data Protection Board (and each of their successors); For example AMEX
sending EPA files, such as the SSK file not conforming to the Application Interface
Specification owing to being unencrypted, resulting in GDPR/PCI data such as PAN
numbers being in the clear.

NB. For a Major Incident the POA Major Incident Process (SVM/SDM/PRO/0001) should be followed.

9.5.3. Examples of IT Incidents
e = Theft of IT equipment / property, including software
e Malicious damage to IT equipment /property, including software
e Theft or loss of Protectively Marked, caveat or sensitive IT Data
e Actual or suspected attacks on the Fujitsu Services POA Network or Information System

data such as PAN numbers being in clear.

The above list is a non-exhaustive list of examples. Any other IT related incidents
reported, will be considered and passed to the appropriate authority for action.

9.5.4 Containment

Whenever an Incident is identified which presents a serious threat to conduct normal business it should
be contained and isolated as quickly as possible. This will mean platforms that appear to have suffered
virus attack or other malicious code attack need to be quarantined immediately to prevent further spread.
It may also be necessary to isolate network connections that appear to be the source for Denial of
Service threats or where they have been subjected to suspected hacking attack.

If the incident relates to card data, the environment may be subject to a Forensic Investigation imposed
by POL's merchant acquirer. In this instance log data will need to be reviewed and analysed.

9.6 Reporting

Whenever a security incident is identified which presents a serious threat to conducting normal business
it is contained and isolated as quickly as possible.

Asecurity Incident is first notified to either the MAC or SMC Team, then transferred to the SecOPs call
stack, once it is initially assessed as a Security Incident by MAC/SMC.

Security Incidents may also be reported directly into the POA SecOps team via the reporting button on

the POA Portal. It is important to allow the 2 reporting methods, as some staff may want to report some
types of security incidents directly to the SecOps team. The initial report will be validated and clarified
by SecOps, with calls made to the initiator if more information is required. SecOps will follow team work
instructions to progress their investigation.

All Security Incidents are to be reported to the SecOps team via a dedicated mailbox and escalated by
phone if necessary. Depending on the type of Incident and the severity of the incident, POA Security
makes the decision to escalate details to the POL Security teams. In the case of Data Centre incidents,
POA Security also informs the Data Centre.

CONFIDENCE)

Regardless of the severity of the incident, when a compromise in card data occurs, the incident is
reported to POL Security so that POL can comply with its contractual obligations with its card acquirer.

The investigation of a reported incident is carried out by a nominated investigator from the POA SecOps
team. POL Security Teams will be on hand to provide support as required and in accordance with the
POL Information Security Incident Management Procedure. The investigator will obtain as much original
evidence as possible to ensure that is admissible in court, if required.

Following the initial investigation and where considered appropriate, the appropriate senior manager
within POL liaises with the local Police or other external agencies.

When an investigation is closed the POA Security Manager seeks to ensure that details of the
investigation have been recorded and can be made available for Route Cause Analysis, trending &
lessons learned.

9.7 Investigation

9.7.1 Policy

Although all security incidents will initially be reported to the POA Security Manager in order to have one
point of contact for all parties, some or all of the investigation requirements may be passed to one or
more of the following for further action. The decision of delegation will be determined by the POA Security
Manager in association with POL Information Security Incident Manager.

9.7.2 POL Security / Investigation Team

9.7.2.1

In the event that the reporting of an incident is passed to POL Security or the Investigation Team, details
of the investigation, and final outcome or reference details, should be added to the TfSNow call which
can be communicated to-POL. It is important that for any incident investigated the correct procedures are
adopted regarding evidence, as the information collected and recorded may be used for evidential
purposes at a later date.

9.7.2.2

In the event that the POA Security Team takes ownership of an investigation, they will report the results
to POL and Fujitsu Security team.

9.7.2.3

During any investigation the Investigator must comply with the appropriate legislation and compliance
requirements and regulatory or standard requirements.

9.7.2.4

All initial investigations should be carried out at the earliest opportunity and any queries should be
directed to POA Security Manager. Investigation must be reliable, stand up to scrutiny and potential
cross-examination and evidence must be properly obtained, recorded and time stamped.

9.7.3 External Investigator

ee) POA Operations Incident Management Procedure
! FUJITSU RESTRICTED (COMMERCIAL IN
CONFIDENCE)

Should it be considered necessary the incident might be passed to an external Investigator or forensics
team, who will ensure that any data required for evidential purposes is captured and investigated using a
systematic approach which ensures that an auditable record of evidence is maintained and can be
retrieved. In some cases, where a compromise to card data is involved, two Forensic Investigation teams
may be involved. One team operating on behalf of POL gathering the required audit logs to use to
analyse and investigate the problem. A second Forensic Investigations team may be imposed to
investigate on behalf of the card acquirer and card schemes. In all incidents where a Forensic
Investigation is involved, the Forensic Investigators will be shadowed by POL's Legal and Security
Teams.

9.7.4 Evidence Rules

9.7.4.1 Rules of Evidence

Before undertaking security incident investigation and computer forensics it is essential that investigators
have a thorough understanding of the Rules of Evidence. The submission of evidence in any type of legal
proceedings generally amounts to a significant challenge, but when computers are involved the problems
are intensified. Special knowledge is needed to locate and collect evidence, and special care is required
to preserve and transport evidence. Evidence in computer crime cases differs from traditional forms of
evidence in as much as most computer related evidence is intangible and is in the form of electronic
pulse or magnetic charge, hence the need to use specialist teams. That said the information collected
and recorded from the Operational areas is equally important and must be recorded with due care and
diligence.

9.7.4.2 Types of Evidence

Many types of evidence can be offered in court to prove the truth or falsity of a given fact.
The most common forms of evidence are Direct, Real, Documentary and Demonstrative.
Direct Evidence

Direct evidence is oral testimony whereby the knowledge is obtained from any of the witness's five
senses and is in itself proof or disproof of a fact in issue. Direct evidence is called to prove a specific act
such as an eye witness statement.

Real Evidence

Real evidence also known as associative or physical evidence is made up of tangible evidence that
proves or disproves guilt. Physical evidence includes such things as tools used in the crime, and
perishable evidence capable of reproduction etc. The purpose of physical evidence is to link the suspect
to the scene of the crime. It is that evidence that has material existence and can be presented to the view
of the court and jury for consideration.

Documentary Evidence

Documentary evidence is presented to the court in forms of business records, manuals, printouts etc.
Much of the evidence submitted in a computer crime case is documentary evidence.

Demonstrative Evidence

Demonstrative evidence is evidence used to aid the jury. It may be in the form of a model, experiment,
chart or an illustration offered as proof.

9.7.5 Process

In most cases response to a reported incident the initial investigation will be carried out by a nominated
investigator normally the POA Security Manager or a member of the SecOps team. POL Security Teams
will be on hand to provide backup and assistance if required. When seizing evidence from a computer

related crime the investigator will collect any and all physical evidence such as the personnel computer,
peripherals, notepads and documentation etc., in addition to computer generated evidence.

There are four types of computer generated evidence:
e Visual output on a monitor.
e Printed evidence on a plotter.
e Printed evidence on a printer.

e Film recordings on such digital media as disc, USB stick, log files, tape or cartridge, and optical
representation on either CD or DVD.

The investigator will endeavour to obtain as much original evidence as possible. In the event of a court
appearance the court prefers the original evidence rather that a copy but will accept a duplicate if the
original is lost or destroyed or is in the possession of a third party who cannot be subpoenaed.

9.7.5.1

Following the initial investigation and where considered appropriate, the investigator will report to/ liaise
with the local Police and/or other external Agencies; this will only be done following consultation with the
POL Head of Security and POL Head of Information Security or substitute.

Copies of the initial and follow up reports will be submitted to relevant authorities and details of all
investigations will be held on file by the POA Security to aid any subsequent trend analysis.

9.8 Remedial Action

9.8.1 On Completion of report

When the final report of an investigation has been completed, it should be passed to the relevant
authority for follow up action, the results of which should be referred back to the POA Security Manager.

9.8.2 Completion of Investigation

When an investigation is closed the POA Security Manager will ensure all details of the investigation
have been recorded and can be made available for subsequent future analysis.

9.9 Trends & Auditing

9.9.1 Frequency

9.9.1.1

POA Security Team carries out a monthly check of investigations and creates a summary report
highlighting incidents to the POL Head of Information Security.

The report highlights trends or weaknesses which may need to be raised at future Information Security
Management Forums (ISMF). POA will also submit a quarterly report to the Fujitsu Security
Management Forum, to ensure that Fujitsu Security Incident trends can be reviewed in the round.
