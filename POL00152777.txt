Hi - ’m uncomfortable with the final sentence. I know we've used it in the draft Pano statement, but I want to think on it
overnight to make sure the line to both the Shrop Star and Pano properly covers the 2x bugs we identified for SS, which
did affect account balances.

Can I please get this to you tomorrow?

Here’s what I am giving back to the paper ~ taken from previous (and latest cleared Panorama lines). Just nice and
neutral I think. Might just give this to everyone from now on!

The Post Office’s computer system is used successfully by 78,000 people to process six million transactions
every working day in communities throughout the UK.

Over the past three years there have been exhaustive investigations into a very small number of complaints from
mainly former postmasters, a number of which are now resolved. This work has provided overwhelming
evidence that the computer system was not responsible for missing money in these Post Office branches.

Mark — fyi

This has just come in from the Shropshire Star (1) lam copying Mark and Jane because it shows Ron Warmington is
speaking to the press.

I will devise a ‘nothing new’ line simply restating Post Office position about the system.

The Shropshire Star is of course the paper that has run articles featuring Mrs Shaheen.

Good afternoon,

Further to our conversation a few minutes ago, I am following up the story that Second Sight has written to the
Government saying that its findings of its report on the Horizon computer system have been misrepresented.
The story is on P10 of yesterday's Telegraph, and I have spoken to Ron Warmington of Second Sight who has
confirmed his concerns have been misrepresented after minister George Freeman said: “Second Sight produced
two independent reports — one in 2013 and the other earlier this year — both of which found there was no
evidence of systemic flaws in the system.”

Mr Warmington has said that the term "systemic" can only be used when referring to a constant fault, and that is
why the report said there were no systemic faults.

However, he says the report clearly said there were circumstances where a combination of factors could lead to
a fault in the system which could account for some of the discrepancies which have resulted in civil and
criminal proceedings against sub-postmasters.

If you would be able to give me a response, I would be very grateful.

Regards,
