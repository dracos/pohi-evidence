AN INTRODUCTION

Disclosure is one of the most
important - as well as one of the
most abused - of the procedures
relating to criminal trials.

The overarching principle is that

unused prosecution material will fall to

be disclosed if, and only if, it satisfies

the test for disclosure. Even then, it

may not be disclosed under certain
. Circumstances.
