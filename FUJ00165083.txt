Jonny,

Understandably Steve is somewhat pre-occupied today so I have not been able to discuss with him.
Here is where I have got to.

Regards etc

Torstein,

I think you can ignore the distinction — basically Fujitsu and Robert added some comments to the transcripts and Tony
has questions about them and for the questions on Robert comments, we think Fujitsu are best placed to answer.

Will you be able to get this back to me today?

Kind regards
Jonny

Jonny,
I can’t quite work out what Robert’s questions are — is there a separate document?

Dear all,

Please find attached some questions from Counsel relating to your comments on the transcripts from day 7 and 8 of
the Horizon Issues Trial plus some comments from Robert on the day 7 transcript that we anticipate Fujitsu will know
the answer to.

Please would you take a look and let me have an ETA on providing a response?

Kind regards

Jonny
