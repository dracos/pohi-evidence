Dear Sirs

The Post Office Group Litigation
Stage 3 Disclosure

Pursuant to paragraph 3 of the Fourth CMC Order (as amended by paragraph 3 of the Fifth CMC Order),
please find enclosed Post Office's Disclosure List for Stage 3 Disclosure. The documents are in the
process of being exported by Advanced Discovery to Elevate.

The parties have adopted the draft Practice Direction "Disclosure Pilot for the Business and Property
Courts" and for this stage of disclosure Post Office has been ordered to provide is request-led search
based disclosure under Model C. The classes of documents to be disclosed are set out in Schedule 1 to
the Fourth CMC Order. An explanation of the steps taken to locate the documents which fall within each
of the classes is set out below.

41. Classes 1 to 3, 5to 10 and 15

14 Each of these classes required Post Office to provide disclosure of documents which were
submitted to either a Category 1, 2 or 3 Custodian. Category 1 comprised of Post Office's Board
of Directors and Group Executive. A list of the 68 Custodians who were incorporated within
Categories 2 and 3 is set out at Schedule 1 of this letter.

1.2 In relation to documents submitted to Category 1 Custodians, Post Office's Company Secretarial
team are responsible for managing the documents submitted to Board of Directors and Group
Executive. An extract of the documents held within the Company Secretarial team drive was
taken (amounting to 10,926 documents) and the following keywords were run:

1.3 These responsive documents (plus family documents) were subject to a manual review for
relevancy and privilege, and disclosure of these documents was provided on 29 June 2018.

1.4 In relation to documents submitted to Category 2 and 3 Custodians, searching the email
accounts of these custodians inherently confirms that the documents were submitted to them and
is likely to return the greatest volume of responsive documents (as explained in our letters of 22
June and 12 July 2018). There were 6.7m documents within these custodians’ email accounts
(or 5.4 million documents post de-duplication). These 5.4 million de-duplicated documents were
uploaded to our e-disclosure platform.

15 To identify the relevant documents which were submitted to these custodians, the search criteria
set out in the table below were applied resulting in 34,785 responsive documents being manually
reviewed for relevancy and privilege.

1.7 Having corrected this, additional responsive documents have been identified. We are
considering these and how best to filter / review them for disclosable documents and will update
you on this shortly.

2. Class 4 and 11 to 14

21 Enquires have been made with Fujitsu to source the documents which fall within Classes 4 and
11 to 14.

Class 4 - Documents or records recording all data sources outside of Horizon which provide financial or
transactional data into Horizon.

2.2 The Application Interface Specification (AIS) documents (disclosed as part of Stage 2 Disclosure)
record the interfaces between Horizon and external systems. The AIS documents can be found
using a keyword search. Disclosure has also been provided of documents within this Class
which were revealed by the searches explained above.

Class 11 - Written policies and processes regarding how the Horizon Service Desk is operated (by both
Fujitsu historically and ATOS now).

2.3 Documents which relate to the operation of the Horizon Service Desk by Fujitsu were disclosed
as part of Stage 2 Disclosure. Fujitsu have identified these as documents with the following
references:

2.3.1 SVM/SDM/PRO/0021
2.3.2 SVM/SDM/SD/0001
2.3.3 CS/SER/002

2.3.4 SVM/SDM/PRO/0003
2.3.5 CS/FSP/021

2.3.6 SVM/SDM/SD/0023

2.4 Documents which relate to the operation of the Horizon Service Desk by ATOS were disclosed

2.5 Further documents have also been located through the searching of the Category 2 and 3
Custodians' email accounts as explained above.

Classes 12 - Written policies and processes regarding database administrator access to Horizon,
including relating to the implementation of fixes that had the ability to impact upon branch accounts or
transactions.

26 See document POL-0215659 which was disclosed as part of Stage 2 Disclosure. This Class also
overlaps with the requests made by the Claimants’ expert which Post Office shall be responding
on shortly.

Class 13 - Any logs in Horizon of when database administrator access has been used and how it was
used.

27 Horizon does keep logs of database administrator access. Fujitsu are working on extracting the
logs. We will update you on this shortly.

Class 14 - Documents containing lists of individuals who had or have database administrator access to
the Horizon Audit Store and the BRDB (Branch Database), from 1999 to date, which allows them to
implement fixes in branch accounts or transactions.

28 There is no formal record or single document that lists individuals with database administrator

access (historic or present). A current list of database administrators could be compiled but it
would only reflect the position on the day it was produced.
