DETAILS OF CHANGE:
1 OVERVIEW

1.1 Post Office has revised its view of how the Towers Model will work in the future. As a result
of this review it has elected to terminate its Front Office Tower provider agreement and
extend the current Agreement with Fujitsu Services until 31° March 2023.

1.2 This CCN1600 extends some of the current services to 31% March 2023 and provides an
amended financial structure, including varying those prices originally agreed in CCN1500a.
For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of CCN1400 and CCN1500a shall remain in force
save as expressly varied by this CCN1600.

1.3 Paragraphs 3 and 4 below set out those services that are expiring and/or being extended.

1.4 Given the change in approach, the Services shall no longer be referred to as “Transitional
Support Services” and as such that definition and references to it shall lapse. However,
given that not all of the Services are being extended to the new expiry date, reference to the
term “Expiring Services” shall be retained.

2 NOTUSED

3 REPLACEMENT OF OTHER OPERATIONAL SERVICES
3.1 The Expiring Services shall expire as follows:

3.1.1 The Operational Business Change (Branch Change) Service, Branch Network Service
and Branch Network Resilience Service and CMT Service will expire on 318‘ March 2017 and
as such are not part of this extension.

3.1.2 The POLSAP Hosting Service, POLSAP Applications Support Service and support for
the Credence/ MDM Service and the Salesforce Support Service will expire on 31% March
2016 and as such are not part of this extension.

3.2 Both parties acknowledge that Post Office may request further extensions to the Expiring
Services referenced in paragraphs 3.1 and 3.2 above to further facilitate the Towers Model
transition or otherwise. Both parties agree to act reasonably in response to such a request
and any associated negotiation of terms, in particular, Fujitsu Services agrees to mitigate its
costs of supply and any stranded costs with respect to any further extensions of the
Expiring Services to the extent it is reasonably possible to do so having regard to, amongst
other things, the timing of any request relative to the expiry date of the Expiring Services.
Post Office acknowledges that an extension may need to be for a longer period than the
revised transition date requested.

33 In addition, Test Rigs, as described and defined in CCN1420a, shall expire on 31° March

FUJ00001132
FUJ00001132

2017 but it is acknowledged by Post Office that the requirement for Test Rigs will be included
as a “P.O. Ltd Responsibility” for this extension and as such that the parties shall agree,
under a subsequent CCN, to an extension to the Test Rigs through to 31% March 2022 and
review thereafter (both parties acting reasonably) to enable future development on the
Horizon platform. For the avoidance of doubt, the charges for this extension are not included
in this CCN1600.

3.4 In accordance with CCN1500a, in the event the parties agree to subsequently extend any of
the Expiring Services, the parties acknowledge that if Post Office gives notice to terminate
any of those Expiring Services after 1 April 2017 then the notice period will be six months.

3.5 It has also been noted that two Service Descriptions, POL MI Hosting Service and
Credence/MDM comprise the same outputs and as such it is agreed that POL MI Hosting
Service shall be deleted and all references to it in the Agreement removed and replaced by
Credence/MDM.

3.6 As part of any termination or expiry of any Services it is agreed that as part of impacting the
remaining Services the parties shall review the applicability of the Call Off Services in Table
B in Schedule B3.1.

4 EXTENDED SERVICES

4.1 The duration of the Agreement (and the Services which are not Expiring Services ) shall be
extended such that the new expiry date shall be 31% March 2023.

4.2 The basic premise of this extension is that both parties have agreed that the risk profile
during the extended period shall remain broadly as it is now and that the hardware and
software used to provide the Services should be upgraded if required to remain within
support. The responsibility for procuring upgrades to hardware and software components
remains with Post Office. As such Post Office shall agree to maintain the risk profile broadly
as at the date of this CCN 1600 and that the hardware and software used to provide the
Services should be upgraded if required to remain within support via:

4.2.1 revision and re-planning work with respect to R&R2 project (CT1848) (such as using
Redhat 7 operating system to ensure security to 2022) to be agreed via a further CT
document;

4.2.2 a third risk and resilience project (referred to as “Trinity 3”), the precise detail of which
is yet to be agreed until completion of a technical roadmap, but shall broadly comprise
the scope set out in Part A of Annex B of this CCN; and

4.2.3 the extension of Test Rigs referred to in paragraph 3.3 above.

Both Post Office and Fujitsu Services shall act reasonably in agreeing these projects.

4.3. At the date of signature of this CCN1600, Oracle’s extended support of the Oracle 11g
database is expected to end on 31% December 2020, the Oracle Linux operating system

FUJ00001132

FUJ00001132

security patching and support ends on 31% March 2021 and the Oracle M4000 server
support for the main batch database ends in September 2018. If Oracle does not extend
these periods of support and the parties agree not to refresh this database such that it goes
out of Oracle extended support during the extension period, the parties have agreed that
Fujitsu Services shall uplift the monthly Charge for the Data Centre Operations Service by
£30,000 per month plus all Incidents associated with the Oracle database will be resolved
on a Time & Materials basis. Oracle’s position on support may evolve and future direction
will be agreed as part of the jointly (Post Office and Fujitsu Services) agreed technology
roadmap as described in paragraph 4.7 below and then implemented via further CCNs and
CTs.

4.4 Post Office acknowledges that a further review will be required to understand what additional

risk and resilience projects are required to cover the period 1* April 2022 to 31%' March 2023
to maintain the current service risk profile and as such Post Office will remain responsible for
procuring and paying for any additional works identified. However, both parties acknowledge
and agree, subject to paragraph 4.3 above, that notwithstanding the specified scope in
Annex B to this CCN and any risk and resilience project for 1% April 2022 to 31% March 2023,
they shall work together (acting reasonably) to agree the most cost effective (to Post Office)
means, provided that the risk in delivery (to Fujitsu) is not negatively affected, of maintaining
service surety over the term of the extension.

4.5 As a result of this extension, Fujitsu Services will need to extend its tenancy at the Belfast

datacentres beyond their current expiry date of December 2018. Post Office agrees in return
for Fujitsu Services managing this tenancy extension Post Office shall partially waive its
rights to terminate the Agreement (and/or any and all of the extended Services) for
convenience such that it may only exercise its rights of termination for convenience effective
on or after 1 April 2021. The table in Schedule E, Annex 1 shall be amended accordingly.
The Agreement shall expressly reference that any Termination Charges or Partial
Termination Charges shall include the remaining lease charges (including any additional
dilapidation costs) payable by Fujitsu Services for the Belfast datacentres through to 31*
March 2023 as a stranded cost payable by Post Office, subject to:

4.5.1 Fujitsu Services mitigating such costs where it is reasonably possible to do so;

4.5.2 Fujitsu Services providing to Post Office evidence of such costs;

4.5.3 such costs not, in any event, being greater than the charges payable by Post Office had
Post Office remained in the data centres until the end of the term; and

4.5.4 in relation to any Termination Charges, these shall in total be no greater than the relevant

4° Itis noted by both parties that it has not been possible to conclude the extension to the
leases prior to execution of this CCN1600. To this end, there remains a risk that the lease

Termination Charge Cap. The Termination Charge Caps shall be as follows:

(a) £15,000,000 (fifteen million pounds), where Post Office terminates this Agreement
between 1 April 2021 and 31 March 2022 (inclusive); and

(b) £10,000,000 (ten million pounds), where Post Office terminates this Agreement
between 1 April 2022 and 30 March 2023 (inclusive).
For the avoidance of doubt, the Expiry Licence Fee and Termination Licence Fee are
not part of the Termination Charge and as such are not included in the Termination
Charge Cap.

FUJ00001132
FUJ00001132

extensions will not be concluded and that Fujitsu Services will be required to transition the
hosted equipment to a replacement datacentre. In the unlikely event that this risk crystalises
such that Fujitsu Services has to exit a datacentre, Fujitsu Services shall not be entitled to
charge Post Office its own costs of moving and re-installing the equipment (nor any moving
and installing costs relating to Fujitsu Service’s Sub-contractors or suppliers). However, Post
Office shall (and shall procure its third party suppliers, clients and customers shall) facilitate
such a transition (at no additional cost to Fujitsu Services) by:

4.6.1 arranging and procuring Post Office’s third party suppliers, clients and customers shall
install and parallel run network connections needed to the existing and new datacentres;
and

4.6.2 participating (and procuring participation by its third party suppliers, clients and customers
shall participate) in the planning and implementation for the connection migrations in line
with an agreed project plan,

and a let on any service levels to enable the movements and/or replacement of the relevant
hardware/infrastructure.

4.7 Over the course of the term to 31% March 2023, it is the agreed intention of both parties that
the Services and the underlying infrastructure from which they are provided shall evolve as
Post Office’s business requirements change and also in line with new technology. The
parties acknowledge and agree that this evolution should include standardisation (e.g. of the
interfaces and moving to a Fujitsu Services Cloud based hosting capability) and that such
standardisations should then be capable of being benchmarked. Fujitsu Services and Post
Office will work together to jointly agree a technology roadmap and plan which will cover
issues such as standardisation and changes to support by third party licensors (e.g. Oracle).
The existing CCN and CT processes shall be used to agree the technology roadmap and
plan and any subsequent changes. The parties have a joint expectation that service will
move to a Fujitsu Services Cloud based shared infrastructure during the life of the contract,
enabling lower run costs.

5 RATE CARD

5.

Subject to the condition in paragraph 5.3 below, the parties have agreed that the current
Rate Cards (on-shore and off-shore) shall be amended in accordance with Annex C to this
CCN1600 for on-shore and off-shore rates. These new Rate Cards comprise an average
18% discount to the on-shore rate and 22% discount for the off-shore rate.

5.2 These new Rate Cards shall take effect on 1* April 2016 and as such shall apply to all new
projects contracted after 1° April 2016. All in-flight projects shall remain on the current rate
card, unless otherwise agreed. The new Rate Cards do not include the indexation
calculation for 2015/16 (and subsequent years). Indexation shall apply to the rates in the
Rate Cards from 1 April 2016 on the basis of the procedure set out in the Agreement.

5.3 As a condition for the introduction of these new Rate Cards, Post Office commits to 16 full
time equivalent on-shore posts in line with the current “Core Team” model from 1* April 2017
to 31 March 2023.

54 There shall be no other discount regime unless otherwise agreed on a case by case basis
and as such the additional committed monthly spend discount mechanism detailed in

FUJ00001132
FUJ00001132

paragraph 13 of Annex 3 to Schedule A2 shall lapse on 31 March 2017.

6 CHARGES
6.1 Revised Schedule D1

The revised Annex B to Schedule D1 is set out in Annex D to this CCN and sets out details of
the following:

6.1.1. the unmodified Operational Charges for the Services through to 31% March 2017; and

6.1.2 the Operational Charges for the Services continuing from 1° April 2017 to 31% March
2023.

6.2 The Operational Charges are subject to the following assumptions:

6.2.1. Network Tower dependency

A branch Network is required which shall be provided by Verizon on or before 1* April
2017. It is assumed that the implementation/ deployment of the new network and any
associated service activity required of Fujitsu Services by Post Office (including in order
to provide the Services) will be fulfilled and contracted as part of the branch network exit
activity (and be subject to additional charges).

6.2.2 Back Office Tower

Migration of those elements of the Expiring Services to the Back Office Tower provider
(POLSAP Services, Credence/MDM Hosting Service) and ongoing connectivity of the
Horizon system to the replacement Back Office systems and any associated service
changes shall be contracted as part of the associated Exit activity and may impact the
ongoing Service charges (which will be agreed via a CCN). No charges for this activity or
Expiring Services beyond the dates set out above are included in this CCN.

6.2.3 EUC Tower

a) Horizon Anywhere (developed under CT 1765, which delivers a deployable package
master to the EUC Tower provider for them to deploy) would be rolled out and completed
by 31% March 2017. To this end, no costs for roll out or parallel running are included in
this CCN and as such it is assumed that any changes to the services and variation to the
Operational Charges will be covered under a roll out CCN for Horizon Anywhere, to be
agreed by both parties, acting reasonably. This position is understood as the working
position by the Horizon Anywhere tripartite working group.

» HNGX counters will be completely replaced by HNGA counters by 31% March 2017. To
this end, under the R&R2 programme (CT 1848) the equipment associated with these
counters/ application are currently not being refreshed in the Belfast datacentres and

FUJ00001132
FUJ00001132

c)

6.3 Post Office and Fujitsu Services have agreed to reverse the variable to fixed charges
position agreed as part of CCN1500a. To this end:

6.3.1

6.3.2

6.4 Indexation

6.5 Benchmarking

would be decommissioned. If a mixed Horizon Anywhere and HNGX estate is required
beyond 31% March 2017 (a change to the current plan) then a review and solution design
will be required. Any adjustment to the associated service charges (to reflect the dual
running) and any additional equipment in the Belfast datacentres that will now have to be
refreshed and not decommissioned as per current R&R2 programme plan will be covered
by a CCN and CT respectively.

The EUC Tower provider is responsible for all monitoring, management, AV, break fix
and deployment of software onto the counters. It is recognised that Post Office has
asked Fujitsu Services to develop some of these capabilities under Horizon Anywhere
Gaps, CT1944a, (which covers such services as event collection, certificate signing etc.
but excludes AV, operating systems, deployment etc.). The service changes and
associated charges for this CT, normally captured in a CCN, are not factored into the
Operational Charges proposed in this CCN and the R&R2 programme will require a
change to refresh the associated datacentre equipment. This position is understood as
the working position by the Horizon Anywhere tripartite working group.

The minimum charge (equivalent to 37 Post Office Service Types) shall be removed from
the Unit Charge per Post Office Service Type; and

The Unit Charge per Counter Position and Unit Charge per Branch shall be reintroduced
and the fixed charge element (included to replace the variable element) removed.
However, in order to align with Post Office’s changes to the way it uses the Services and
engages with its Customers:

a) the definition of Counter Position shall be changed to:

“means an IT device (with a counter identifier within the Horizon system) where a
Customer transacts business with a Counter Clerk or other Sub-Postmaster or
Post Office representative or with a similarly automated back-office position in a
Branch where a User carries out administration;”

b) the Unit Charge per Counter Position shall be subject to a “floor” of 22,000
Counter Positions (current volume as at 4°" January 2016 is 27,958).

CCN1400 included a waiver of some elements of Fujitsu Services’ entitlement to uplift all
Operational Charges in accordance with the indexation calculations referenced in
paragraph 16 of Schedule D1 (Charges) on an annual basis. This partial waiver expires
on 31% March 2017 and is not extended by this CCN1600 (or the previous CCN1500a).

A credit mechanism is specified in Schedule D1 to reflect the agreement of £25 million for
FY 17/18 for the scope of the extended Services as at the date of this CCN.

FUJ00001132

FUJ00001132

6.5.1

Both parties acknowledge that benchmarking the entire Agreement and/or elements of
the Services has proved very difficult in the past.

To this end, the parties have agreed that whilst the right to benchmark the Agreement
shall be reinstated, it shall be limited to the following elements of the Agreement:

a) The on-shore and off-shore Rate Cards but Post Office shall only be entitled to
benchmark these rate cards after 1% April 2020; and

b) Where the parties agree to a Gain Share project to transform an element of the
Services and where it is agreed (both parties acting reasonably) that the transformed
element of the Service is then delivered in a more industry standard way (for
example via a Cloud laaS mechanism), that standard element of the service shall be
subject to the right to benchmark provided that such benchmark shall not apply until
18 months after the transformed element of the Services goes live.

In order to facilitate the benchmarking of these elements in the future, the parties have
agreed to consider changes to Schedule D6 (Marketing Testing) to change the approach
to make it capable of standard benchmarking.

Both Fujitsu Services and Post Office acknowledge that they will use reasonable
endeavours to agree a revised benchmarking approach.

6.6 Invest to Save

6.6.1

6.6.2

As part of the financial model for the term extension, the parties have agreed to an
“Invest to Save” model.

This model shall work as follows:

a) Post Office commits to pay £1.3m at the beginning of each of the first three years of
the extended term to Fujitsu.

b) In return, Fujitsu shall deliver the following savings against the Operational Charges
in Annex C (both the committed payment from Post Office and the savings shall be
subject to indexation from 1% April 2018 in accordance with the terms of the
Agreement). In each year this shall be applied as a credit to the Operational
Charges, pro-rated on a monthly basis:

FY17/18 =I FY18/19 I FY19/20 I FY20/21_ I FY21/ I FY22/

22 23

c) For the avoidance of doubt, the Invest to Save mechanism detailed above does not
compound the savings. As such the Invest to Save discount is applied to the
Operational Charge for that Financial Year (including any adjustments for RPI)
excluding any previous Invest to Save discounts in the previous years. Hence the
FY21/22 and FY22/23 charges (for the same scope) would be the same (after the
discount) save for the application of indexation. To this end, if the indexation rates
were zero for the term of this deal, the Operational Charges for the scope of the
extended services, detailed in paragraph 4.1 above (excluding the “Core Team”
commitment) would look as follows:

FY17/18 I FY18/19 I FY19/20 I FY20/21 I FY21/2 I FY22/2
2 3

Annual Operational £25m - £25m - £25m - £25m - £25m - I £25m -
Charge for extended £0.11m £0.57m £1.37m £2.06m £2.4m_ I £2.4m
service scope
(excluding Core Team
commitment)

® It shall be at Fujitsu Services’ absolute discretion what projects it implements in order
to achieve the required savings in its cost base but provided that Post Office makes
the capital investments detailed above, this shall be at Fujitsu Services’ risk. In order
to enable Fujitsu Services to achieve these required savings, Post Office

FUJ00001132
FUJ00001132

acknowledges and agrees that Fujitsu Services may need to make technical changes
to the solution, assets and/or restructure its resources and/or increase its off-shore
capability and as such, to the extent to which Fujitsu Services is required to ask
consent from Post Office to enact these or any other changes, Post Office shall not
unreasonably withhold or delay such consent and the costs of any such technical
change shall be borne by Fujitsu Services.

6.6.3 This Invest to Save model is separate from the current contracted Gain Share
mechanism which shall remain available for both parties to make use of in the future.
However, for the avoidance of doubt, no single project can be part of this Invest to Save
model and the Gain Share mechanism and as such it shall be at Fujitsu Services’
absolute discretion whether it elects to deliver a project as part of its commitment under
the Invest to Save mechanism or the Gain Share approach. The parties agree this is fair
given the fact that Fujitsu Services is taking the risk of achieving the requisite savings in
the first place.

6.7 Termination Charges

6.7.1 For the avoidance of doubt, where the Agreement or Terminable Service is terminated in
accordance with Clauses 47.7 and 47.10.2(a) it shall be subject to a Termination Charge
or Partial Termination Charge as outlined in Schedule E.

The principles associated with the calculation of the Termination Charge and/or Partial
Termination Charge are set out below:

a) no Termination Charges or Partial Termination Charges shall be applicable to the
Expiring Services provided they expire as follows: (i) Operational Business Change
(Branch Change) Service, the Branch Network Service, Branch Network Resilience
Service and CMT Service on 31% March 2017; and (ii) POLSAP Hosting Service,
POLSAP Applications Support Service and support for the Credence Application
(including the MDM application) and the Salesforce Support Service on 31% March
2016;

b) in the event that Post Office elects to extend the expiry date of any Expiring Service,
the Partial Termination Charge shall be calculated to the revised expiry date for that
service;

c) for all other Services, the Partial Termination Charge and the calculation of the
Termination Charge for termination of the whole Agreement shall be calculated by
reference to an expiry date of 31° March 2023; and

d) payments by Post Office of Termination Charges or Partial Termination Charges shall
be subject to:

(A) in relation to any stranded costs, Fujitsu Services mitigating its stranded costs
where it is reasonably possible to do so;

(B) in relation to any stranded costs, Fujitsu Services providing to Post Office
evidence of such stranded costs;

(C) in relation to any stranded costs, such stranded costs not, in any event, being
greater than the relevant charges payable by Post Office had Post Office not
terminated the relevant Services or whole Agreement (as applicable); and

(D) in relation to any Termination Charges, these shall in total be no greater than
the relevant Termination Charge Cap. The “Termination Charge Cap” shall be
as follows:

FUJ00001132
FUJ00001132

(a) where Post Office terminates the Agreement for convenience between 1
April 2021 and 31 March 2022 (inclusive), the Termination Charge Cap
shall be £15,000,000 (fifteen million pounds); and

(b) where Post Office terminates the Agreement for convenience between 1
April 2022 and 30 March 2023 (inclusive), the Termination Charge Cap
shall be £10,000,000 (ten million pounds).

For the avoidance of doubt, the Expiry Licence Fee and Termination Licence

Fee are not part of the Termination Charge and as such are not included in the
Termination Charge Cap.

7 PARENT COMPANY GUARANTEE

Fujitsu Services shall obtain an extension to the current guarantee from Fujitsu Services
Holdings plc such that it aligns to an expiry date of 31% March 2023. The form of the
amendment to the parent company guarantee is included at Annex E to this CCN1600.

8 REDUNDANCY ON TERMINATION OR EXPIRY OF SERVICES (EXCLUDING THE
EXPIRING SERVICES)

With respect to the Services being extended to 31% March 2023 (which for the avoidance of
doubt excludes the Expiring Services), Post Office agrees that without prejudice to any other
rights and obligations in the Agreement, in the event of a termination or expiry of such
services that takes effect on or after 1% April 2017, it shall indemnify Fujitsu Services with
respect to any staff that do not transfer to the Next Supplier and are made redundant by
Fujitsu Services within 30 business days of Fujitsu Services notifying Post Office in

accordance with Clause 75.15 following the termination or expiry of the Agreement. This
indemnity shall be capped at three million pounds (£3,000,000).

9 LIMIT OF LIABILITY

The parties have agreed that Fujitsu Services annual aggregate cap on its liability shall
increase to £15,000,000 (fifteen million pounds) for any and all claims by Post Office and/or
any Tower Contractor arising in a Financial Year or at any time after the last Financial Year.

10 EXIT CHARGES

For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions regarding the provision of the service desk call and
transitional audit data set out in CCN1500a shall continue to apply.

11 IP LICENCE

There will be a binding commitment (not an option) for Post Office to pay Fujitsu £10
million that will crystallise on 1 April 2023. In return, Post Office will receive a licence

FUJ00001132
FUJ00001132

(from expiry of the Agreement) giving it in perpetuity the Horizon Software IPR (as
defined below) enabling Post Office and third party suppliers supporting Post Office’s
business to use the Horizon Software IPR. In the event that either party terminates the
Agreement, then Post Office shall pay to Fujitsu Services the sum detailed in the table
below and the licence shall commence upon payment of the licence fee:

Date of termination of the Agreement

Up to and including 31% March 2018 £25,000,000
From 1* April 2018 to 31% March 2019 £22,500,000
From 1* April 2019 to 318 March 2020 £20,000,000
From 1* April 2020 to 318 March 2021 £17,500,000
From 1* April 2021 to 31% March 2022 £15,000,000
From 1° April 2022 to 30" March 2023 £12,500,000

There is also the option for Post Office to receive the IPR licence and associated materials up to
12 months prior to the expiry of the Agreement, provided that, in re-procurement of services
similar to the services provided by Fujitsu Services under the Agreement, there has been down
selection to the Next Supplier. In these circumstances the £10 million fee will be increased to
£12.5 million and will be payable prior to Post Office receiving the IPR licence and associated
materials (therefore 12 months earlier).

In addition, there is the option for Post Office to receive the IPR licence and associated materials
up to 12 months prior to termination of the Agreement by Post Office. The additional fee
payable for early release in these circumstances will depend on the timing of the termination and
how early the IPR licence and associated materials are to be provided relative to the termination
date of the Agreement.

Further provisions in relation to the IPR licence, are contained below in the section headed
“Proposed Revision to Wording of the Agreement”.

12 LEGAL UPDATES and TOWERS UPDATE
12.1 The original Agreement was signed in 1999 and since then there have been numerous

changes in law. The parties agree that the Agreement should be updated via a separate,
additional CCN to reflect the following changes in law:

a) the General Data Protection Regulation (necessitating changes to the data protection
provisions at Schedule A4 and clause 33.2);

b) Rome II (necessitating changes to the law and jurisdiction provision at clause 71);

c) the Bribery Act 2010 (necessitating an additional clause being added to the Agreement);
and

d) the Third Party Rights Act 1999 (necessitating an additional clause being added to the

FUJ00001132

Agreement),
and the parties shall negotiate in good faith to agree such separate, additional CCN.

12.2 Post Office and Fujitsu Services agree to formally review the delivery of the Services
against the Towers Model beyond that agreed in Schedule F of the Agreement. For the
avoidance of doubt, it is agreed by the parties that the final paragraph of Schedule F will still
apply. The parties agree that they will use reasonable efforts to complete this review and
agree any service and contract changes by 30 September 2016. This will include, but not be
limited to, alignment to the Post Office IT Supply Chain Operational Working Agreements
(OWA's), governance of the Services and the Change Control Procedure.

13 GENERAL

13.1 For the avoidance of doubt, both parties acknowledge that the warranty at Clause 15.2
of the Agreement was provided upon execution of CCN1200 and has no further effect under
this CCN1600.

13.2 Terms used in this CCN which are not otherwise defined shall have the meaning given in
the Agreement.

13.3 In the event of a conflict between this paragraph 13 together with paragraphs 1 to 12
above of this CCN and the revisions to the wording of the Agreement contained below, the
revisions to the wording of the Agreement below shall take precedence.

which has been executed thereafter, as listed in Annex A to this CCN1600.

14 EXIT

Fujitsu Services acknowledges that Post Office will be reviewing Schedule E (Exit) and related
exit provisions and the parties will discuss revisions to exit e.g. preparation and maintenance of

parties that this review will consider the impact of the Expiring Services on the end-to-end
service delivery risk currently owned by Fujitsu Services.

PROPOSED REVISION TO WORDING OF THE AGREEMENT ( including Schedule reference)

Throughout the Agreement, “POL MI Hosting Service” shall be deleted and all references to it in
the Agreement replaced with “Credence/MDM”.

Contents

In the contents page of the Agreement, the reference to “Schedule B3.1 —- HNG-X Services and
Transitional Support Services” shall be deleted and replaced with “Schedule B3.1 - HNG-X
Services”.

Recitals:

Anew Recital (j) shall be inserted in the Recitals to the Agreement as follows:

a) On 22 February 2016 the Parties signed CCN1600 which made certain changes to the
Codified Agreement and the expiration date for the Codified Agreement was extended to
31% March 2023 . The Expiring Services shall expire on 31% March 2016 and 31% March
2017 as set out in the Codified Agreement (unless otherwise extended), with all other
Services (save where terminated early in accordance with the terms of this Agreement)
continuing until 31" March 2023.”

Main Body of the Clauses:

Anew clause 10.9 shall be added as follows:

“It is the agreed intention of the both parties that during the term of this Agreement the Services
and the underlying infrastructure from which they are provided shall evolve as Post Office’s
business requirements change and in line with new technology. The parties acknowledge and
agree that this evolution should include standardisation, including but not limited to the
interfaces and moving to a Fujitsu Services cloud based hosting capability, and that such
standardisations should be capable of being benchmarked in accordance with Schedule D6.
Fujitsu Services and Post Office will work together to jointly agree a technology roadmap and
plan which will cover issues such as standardisation and changes to support by third party
licensors (e.g. Oracle). The existing CCN and commercial terms processes shall be used to
agree the technology roadmap and plan and any subsequent changes. The parties have a joint
expectation that service will move to a Fujitsu Services cloud based shared infrastructure during
the life of the contract, enabling lower run costs.”

A new Clause 24A shall be added as follows:

24A Market Testing

The provisions of Schedule D6 shall apply save that with respect to the provisions of paragraph

FUJ00001132
FUJ00001132

3 of Schedule D6 it shall be limited to the right to benchmark:

a) the on-shore and off-shore Rate Cards but Post Office shall only be entitled to
benchmark these rate cards after 1% April 2020; and

b) where the parties agree to a Gain Share project to transform an element of the
Services and where it is agreed (both parties acting reasonably) that the
transformed element of the Service is then delivered in a more industry standard
way (for example via a Cloud laaS mechanism), that standard element of the
service shall be subject to the right to benchmark provided that such benchmark
shall not apply until 18 months after the transformed element of the Services goes
live.

Insert a new Clause 30.19:

30.19 Licences granted by Fujitsu Services

This Clause 30.19 has been agreed by both Parties on the basis that this Agreement has been
extended such that it expires on 31st March 2023. In the event that the term of this Agreement
is shortened following a declaration of ineffectiveness pursuant to Regulation 98(2) of the Public
Contracts Regulations 2015 SI 2015/102, then this Clause 30.19 shall lapse and have no effect.

Upon expiry or termination of this Agreement for whatever reason (including but not limited to
Post Office terminating this Agreement for cause under Clause 47.1) the following provisions
shall apply:

30.19.1 Subject to Clause 30.19.4, upon expiry of this Agreement (on 31st March 2023)
Post Office shall pay to Fujitsu £10,000,000 in accordance with Clause 30.19.5. Both
Parties agree that if this Agreement is extended beyond 31st March 2023 that the fee
payable on expiry of this Agreement shall be reduced based on the length of the
extended term by reference to the equivalent time to value calculations used to calculate
the Termination Licence Fee (in Clause 30.19.3) below.

30.19.2 In the event that either Party terminates this Agreement, then Post Office shall
pay to Fujitsu Services the sum calculated in accordance with Clause 30.19.3 (the
“Termination Licence Fee”) in accordance with Clause 30.19.5. For the avoidance of
doubt, where Post Office terminates the Agreement and pays to Fujitsu Services the fee
pursuant to this Clause 30.19.2, it shall not be required to make any further payment
referred to in Clause 30.19 .1 or 30.19.4.

90.19.3 Where Post Office terminates this Agreement, the obligation to pay the

Termination Licence Fee will not arise until after the actual termination of this Agreement

FUJ00001132

FUJ00001132

(the “Agreement Termination Date”), unless Post Office at any time after serving notice
to terminate this Agreement gives notice to Fujitsu Services requiring Fujitsu Services to
provide earlier access to the Horizon Software IPR and Horizon IPR Materials (i.e. prior to
the termination date of this Agreement). Where Post Office gives notice requiring such
earlier access, Fujitsu Services shall provide such access in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement, provided that:

(a) Fujitsu Services shall not be obliged to provide such access earlier than a date that is
12 months prior the date of termination of this Agreement; and

(b) the fee that would otherwise be payable by Post Office on termination of this
Agreement will be modified in these circumstances to reflect the date when Post
Office requires access to the Horizon IPR Materials (the “Termination Early Release
Date”).

The Termination Licence Fee payable pursuant to Clause 30.19.2 is calculated using the
table below:

Agreement Termination Date or (where I Termination Licence Fee
applicable) Termination Early Release
Date (whichever is the earlier)
Up to and including 31% March 2018 £25,000,000
From 1* April 2018 to 31% March 2019 £22,500,000
From 1* April 2019 to 318 March 2020 £20,000,000
From 1* April 2020 to 318 March 2021 £17,500,000
From 1° April 2021 to 318 March 2022 £15,000,000
From 1° April 2022 to 30" March 2023 £12,500,000
30.19.4 Without prejudice to Clause 30.19.2, in the event that Post Office requires earlier

access to the Horizon Software IPR and Horizon IPR Materials (i.e. prior to expiry of this

Agreement) as part of the re-procurement of the Services similar to the services provided

under this Agreement, Post Office may give notice to Fujitsu Services requiring access

up to one year prior to the expiry date of this Agreement provided that:

(a) Post Office shall only require such access to the Horizon Software IPR and Horizon
IPR Materials after down selection of the replacement contract to the Next Supplier;

(b) the fee that would otherwise be payable by Post Office under Clause 30.19.1 to
Fujitsu Services shall in these circumstances be increased to £12,500,000 to reflect
the early access; and

(c) Post Office pays Fujitsu Services the amount payable under Clause 30.19.4.(b) in
accordance with Clause 30.19.5.

Where the conditions described above in this Clause 30.19.4 are met, Fujitsu Services
shall provide such access in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.

FUJ00001132
FUJ00001132

For the avoidance of doubt, where Post Office pays to Fujitsu Services the fee pursuant
to this Clause 30.19.4, it shall not be required to make any additional payment referred to
in Clause 30.19.1 or 30.19.2.

30.19.5 Post Office shall pay the sum due to Fujitsu Services pursuant to Clause 30.19.1,
30.19.2 or 30.19.4 (as applicable) within 30 days following receipt by Post Office of an
invoice that shall be issued by Fujitsu Services no later than 10 working days following
receipt of a valid purchase order by Fujitsu Services and subject to paragraph 10 of
Schedule D2. All sums referred to above are exclusive of any applicable VAT, which
where applicable shall be payable by Post Office in addition to any sum in respect of
which it is calculated.

30.19.5.1 In consideration of the payment by Post Office of the Expiry Licence Fee or
Termination Licence Fee (as applicable), Fujitsu Services hereby grants to Post
Office (such licence being effective from and including the Licence Date) a non-
exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid-up, worldwide licence under the Horizon
Software IPR, for the purpose of using, copying, modifying, adapting, advancing and
developing the Horizon Software, in both object code and source code formats (and

Software IPR). Post Office shall be entitled to use, support, maintain, enhance,
modify and develop the Horizon Software for Post Office’s and Post Office’s
Affiliates’ business purposes only (which shall include, for the avoidance of doubt but
without limitation, the use of the Horizon Software by or on behalf of British Forces
Post Office and use of the Horizon Software by or behalf of Post Office’s franchisees
and agents) (the “Specified Purpose”), provided always that, for the avoidance of
doubt, Post Office and the Post Office Affiliates shall not otherwise under any
circumstances sell or transfer the Horizon Software to third parties (other than to
Post Office Affiliates) or otherwise market or commercially exploit the Horizon
Software by permitting third parties (other than to Post Office Affiliates) to use the
Horizon Software for their own business purposes.

30.19.5.2 Post Office shall be entitled to sub-license its rights in and to the Horizon Software
through multiple tiers of sub-licensee without the prior written consent of Fujitsu
Services, provided that:

(a) the sub-licensees shall only be entitled to use the Horizon Software for the Specified

Affiliates);

(b) the provisions of the agreement under which Post Office sub-licenses its rights:
i. are consistent with the provisions of this Clause 30.19;
ii. contain restrictions equivalent to those set out in this Clause 30.19 in relation to
the use of the Horizon Software;
iii. without prejudice to any liability Fujitsu Services may have to Post Office pursuant
to this Clause 30.19 or as otherwise under this Agreement or at law, ensure that
Fujitsu Services shall have no liability whatsoever to any sub-licensee save for that
which cannot be excluded by law; and
iv. contain termination provisions allowing Post Office to terminate such agreement
in the event the sub-licensee commits a material breach of the agreement by allowing
any third party (other than Post Office or its Affiliates) to use the Horizon Software
other than for the Specified Purpose, and fails to remedy such breach within a period

sub-licensees in relation to their use of the Horizon Software as if such acts and/or
omissions were Post Office’s own.

of nationally recognised standing selected by Fujitsu Services and acceptable to Post
Office (acting reasonably), to examine, at Fujitsu Services’ expense, the relevant books
and records of Post Office as may be reasonably necessary to audit Post Office’s use of
the Horizon Software to ensure it is being used only for the Specified Purpose. An
examination by Fujitsu Services under this Clause shall occur not more than once in any
calendar year (except where Fujitsu Services has reasonable grounds to suspect that
Post Office is not complying with the provisions of this Agreement of which grounds it
provides evidence to Post Office’s satisfaction (acting reasonably), in which case it may
carry out an audit at any time) and shall be limited to the pertinent books and records for
calendar years ending not more than thirty-six (36) months before the date of the
request. The Accounting Firm shall be provided access to such books and records at
such facility(ies) where such books and records are normally kept and such examination
shall be conducted during normal business hours for such facility(ies). The Accounting
Firm may be required to sign a standard non-disclosure agreement before providing the
Accounting Firm access to such facilities or records. Upon completion of the audit, the
Accounting Firm shall provide both Fujitsu Services and Post Office with a written report
disclosing whether Post Office’s use of the Horizon Software is only for the Specified
Purpose, and, in each case, the specific details concerning any discrepancies. No other
information shall be provided to Fujitsu Services.

this Agreement (in object and source code formats);

(b) all legacy versions of the Horizon Software (in object and source code formats), to
the extent such versions are in the possession or control of Fujitsu Services or its
Affiliates (Post Office acknowledges that such legacy versions may not have been
maintained by Fujitsu Services); and

date of the expiry or termination of this Agreement,

liabilities, costs and/or expenses (including, without limitation, properly incurred legal
expenses and other advisers’ fees) incurred by Post Office, its Affiliates or any sub-
licensees arising out of and/or in connection with a claim made by a third party alleging
that the use of the Horizon Software, and/or the documents or materials in which the
Horizon Software IPR subsists as provided by Fujitsu Services under this Agreement, or
the doing of any other act licensed under this Clause 30.19 in accordance with this
Agreement, infringes or otherwise misappropriates the Intellectual Property Rights or
database rights of a third party provided that Post Office promptly upon becoming aware

75.15 This Clause 75.15 shall only apply to those Services (excluding any Expiring Services)
which continue to be provided by Fujitsu Services after 1* April 2017. Notwithstanding
any other provision in this Agreement, in the event that a contract of employment of any
Fujitsu Personnel wholly or mainly assigned (other than on a temporary basis) at the
date of expiry or termination of the relevant service in the provision of the Services
(excluding any Expiring Services) (“In-Scope Employees”) does not transfer to Post
Office or the Next Supplier on the termination or expiry of any element of the Services
(excluding any Expiring Services) as a result of the provisions of the Transfer
Regulations and/or any judicial decision interpreting the same (a “Non-Transferring In-
Scope Employee”) then:

75.15.1 the Party first aware of it shall notify the other within ten (10) business days

FUJ00001132
FUJ00001132

after becoming aware of the same;

75.15.2 if Fujitsu Services, upon becoming aware or being notified of the same,
decides that it does not wish to employ such an individual, Fujitsu Services
shall, within ten (10) business days of such date, notify Post Office of this in
writing;

Supplier shall, make an offer of employment or engagement to any such
individual within ten (10) business days of the date of such notification;

75.15.4 Post Office shall notify Fujitsu Services in writing of any offer of employment or
engagement which is made and any such offer which is refused or accepted by
any such individual;

Supplier is either not made to such individual in accordance with Clause
75.15.3 or is not accepted by such individual within fifteen (15) business days
of the date of notification under Clause 75.15.2, Fujitsu Services may give
notice to terminate his contract of employment at any time not later than thirty
(30) business days after the date of notification under Clause 75.15.2; and

75.15.6 provided that Fujitsu Services acts in accordance with this Clause 75.15 or in
such other way as may be agreed between Fujitsu Services and Post Office,
Post Office shall indemnify and keep indemnified Fujitsu Services against all
costs, liabilities, awards, decisions, losses and expenses (including reasonable
legal fees) reasonably incurred arising out of the termination of employment of
such Non-Transferring In-Scope Employees, including payment in lieu of
notice, following the termination or expiry of any element of the Services
(excluding any Expiring Services) provided that Fujitsu Services takes
reasonable steps to mitigate such exposure.

For the avoidance of doubt, any employee who objects to the transfer of their employment in
accordance with regulation 4(7) of the Transfer Regulations shall not be a Non-Transferring In-
Scope Employee.

The total payments made under the indemnity in Clause 75.15.6 shall be capped at
£3,000,000 (three million pounds) and shall exclude any costs of employing the Non-
Transferring In-Scope Employees during the period in which Fujitsu Services has the benefit of
their services.

A new Clause 76 shall be included which shall be as follows:

76 Belfast Datacentres

It is noted by both Parties that it has not been possible to conclude the extension to the
leases to the Belfast datacentres prior to 16" February 2016. To this end, there remains a

FUJ00001132
FUJ00001132

risk that the lease extensions will not be concluded and that Fujitsu Services will be required
to transition the hosted equipment to a replacement datacentre or alternative service solution
agreed by both Parties. In the unlikely event that this risk crystalises such that Fujitsu
Services has to exit a datacentre, Fujitsu Services shall not be entitled to charge Post Office
its own costs of moving and re-installing the equipment (nor any moving and installing costs
relating to Fujitsu Service’s Sub-contractors or suppliers). However, Post Office shall (and
shall procure its third party suppliers, clients and customers shall) facilitate such a transition
(at no additional cost to Fujitsu Services) by:

76.1 arranging and procuring Post Office’s third party suppliers, clients and customers
shall install and parallel run network connections needed to the existing and new
datacentres; and

76.2 participating (and procuring participation by its third party suppliers, clients and
customers shall participate) in the planning and implementation for the connection
migrations in line with an agreed project plan,

and a let on any relevant Service Levels to enable the movements and/or replacement of the
relevant hardware/infrastructure.

Paragraphs 16.2.A and 16.2B shall be amended such that they apply only between 1° April

“16.2A During the period from 1% April 2015 up to and including 31*' March 2016, the Indexed
Charges (other than the Varied Indexed Charges, Near Shore and Offshore Rates) shall
be indexed as follows:

paragraph 10.4 shall be multiplied by a percentage equal to 100+ the RPI
Percentage applicable to that Financial Year; and

Shore and Offshore Rates) as so adjusted shall be recorded in revised
versions of this Schedule D1 and relevant CCDs.

Indexed Charges) + Varied Indexed Charges.

16.2B.3 Such calculations shall be carried out before the start of each new Financial
Year and the Varied Indexed Charges as so adjusted shall be recorded in
revised versions of this Schedule D1 and relevant CCDs."

A new paragraph 16.2C and 16.2D shall be added that shall read as follows:

“16.2C During the period from 1st April 2016 up to 31% March 2017, the Indexed Charges (other
than the Varied Indexed Charges, Near Shore and Offshore Rates) shall be indexed as
follows:

16.2C.1 in respect of the Financial Year ending 31 March 2017, each of the Indexed
Charges other than the Varied Indexed Charges, the Near Shore and Offshore

Year and the Indexed Charges (other than the Varied Indexed Charges, Near
Shore and Offshore Rates) as so adjusted shall be recorded in revised
versions of this Schedule D1 and relevant CCDs.

16.2C.3 For the avoidance of doubt, this provision means that the indexation
calculations applied as a result of paragraph 16.2.C.1 shall not be carried
through to each subsequent Financial Year.

16.2D During the period from 1st April 2016 up to 31% March 2017, the Varied Indexed Charges
shall be indexed as follows:

Year and the Varied Indexed Charges as so adjusted shall be recorded in
revised versions of this Schedule D1 and relevant CCDs.

16.2D.4 For the avoidance of doubt, this provision means that the indexation

through to each subsequent Financial Year.”

The current paragraph 16.2C shall become paragraph 16.2E but no other changes to that
paragraph shall be made.

The current paragraph 16.2D shall be deleted and replaced with two paragraphs 16.2F and
16.2G:

the Indexed Charges (not including the On Shore and Off Shore Rates which shall be
indexed in accordance with paragraphs 16.2 and 16.4 respectively). For the avoidance
of doubt, if any Expiring Services are extended beyond 31% March 2017, then
notwithstanding they are Indexed Charges, they shall be subject to indexation in
accordance with paragraph 16.2.

16.2G During the period from 1* April 2018 the Indexed Charges (other than Offshore Rates)
shall be indexed as follows:

16.2G.1 In respect of each Financial Year subsequent to the Financial Year ending 31“
March 2018 up to the Financial Year ending 31* March 2023, each of the

Year and the Indexed Charges as so adjusted shall be recorded in revised
versions of this Schedule D1 and relevant CCDs.

16.2G.3 For the avoidance of doubt, the Off Shore Rates shall be indexed in
accordance with paragraph 16.4.”

Insert as a new paragraph 17 the following text with the current paragraph 17 becomes
paragraph 18.

“17 Invest to Save model

17.1 Post Office shall make a payment to Fujitsu of £1.3m (one million three hundred
thousand pounds) on 1st April 2017, 4st April 2018 and 1st April 2019 (total
£3.9m) to pay for Fujitsu Services to invest in projects with the aim to reduce
Fujitsu Services cost base for delivery of the Services (the “Invest to Save
Payment’).

17.2 In consideration of this Invest to Save Payment, the Operational Charges shall be
reduced by the monthly credit referred to in Annex B of Schedule D1 as ‘Invest to
Save Credit’ (the “Invest to Save Credit”). For the avoidance of doubt this credit
shall be in addition to the Trinity 1 Credit referred to in paragraph 2.14 of
Schedule D1.

17.3 It shall be at Fujitsu Services’ absolute discretion what projects it implements as a
result of the receipt of the Invest to Save Payment in order to achieve the required
savings to its cost base to enable the Invest to Save Credit to be provided without
impacting Fujitsu Services’ margin. However this shall be at Fujitsu Services’ risk
and as such the Invest to Save Credit shall be credit irrespective of the
operational savings actually achieved by Fujitsu Services.

17.4 In order to enable Fujitsu Services to achieve these required savings it has
forecasted in order to fund the Invest to Save Credit, Post Office acknowledges
and agrees that Fujitsu Services may need to make technical changes to the
solution, assets and/or restructure its resources and/or increase its off-shore
capability and as such, to the extent to which Fujitsu Services is required to ask
consent from Post Office to enact these or any other changes, Post Office shall
not unreasonably withhold or delay such consent and the costs of any such

FUJ00001132
FUJ00001132

technical change shall be borne by Fujitsu Services.

17.5 The Invest to Save model detailed in this paragraph 17 is separate from the Gain
Share mechanism detailed in Schedule D3 (Gain Share) which shall remain
available for both parties to make use of. However, for the avoidance of doubt, no
single project can be part of this Invest to Save model and the Gain Share
mechanism and as such it shall be at Fujitsu Services’ absolute discretion whether
it elects to deliver a project as part of its commitment under the “Invest to Save”
mechanism set out in this paragraph 17 or the Gain Share mechanism detailed in
Schedule D3 (Gain Share). The Parties agree this is fair given the fact that
Fujitsu Services is taking the risk of achieving the requisite savings.”

Annex B to Schedule D1:

Annex B of Schedule D1 shall be replaced by the spreadsheet “Copy of Sched D1 Annex B v10
02 Nov 15.xlsx” included in Annex D to this CCN.

For the avoidance of doubt the new Schedule D1 Annex B (included as Annex D to this CCN) do
not include the RPI calculation for 2016/17 (and subsequent years) which shall be added to the
relevant Charges on the basis of the procedure set out in the Agreement.

SCHEDULE E — TERMINATION AND THE EXIT PLAN:

Delete paragraphs 1.2.2 and 1.2.3. Insert a new paragraphs 1.2.2, 1.2.3 and 1.2.4 as follows:

“4.2.2 Both Parties agree that the risk profile during the term of this Agreement should
remain broadly constant and that the hardware and software used to provide the
Services should be upgraded if required to remain within support. The responsibility for
procuring upgrades to hardware and software components remains with Post Office. As
such Post Office shall agree to maintain the risk profile broadly as at the date of the CCN
1600 and that the hardware and software used to provide the Services should be
upgraded if required to remain within support via:

(a) a revision and re-planning work with respect to R&R2 project (CT1848) (such as
using Redhat 7 operating system to ensure security to 2022) , which shall be agreed by
the Parties via a further CT document;

(b) a third risk and resilience project (referred to as “Trinity 3”); the precise detail of which
is yet to be agreed upon completion of a technical roadmap, but shall broadly address
the following:

(i) refresh of Brocade SAN switches;

(ii) refresh of 15-30 discrete servers;

(iii) refresh or upgrade of Debit Card connectivity (BT are expected withdraw
kilostream technology in 2018);

(iv) refresh or upgrade of Systems Management EFS servers (for Horizon Anywhere
Gaps proposal);

(v) DC facilities chillers and security systems; and

(vi) Cisco and additional applications; and

in addition it may address:

FUJ00001132
FUJ00001132

(i) Oracle DB/OEL upgrade. The current version goes end of life December 2020. All
the security appliances will need refreshing. McAfee expires December 2019,
Bluecoat 2018

In scoping “Trinity 3” the following assumptions were made:

(i) the full deployment of Horizon Anywhere and the completion of the Branch
Network service migration to a third party by 31% March 2017 and the successful
completion of the R&R2 programme (as amended);

(ii) An expiry date on the Agreement of 31% March 2022;

(iii) Blades & Storage (expiry range 2019-2021) — Assumption is Fujitsu can secure
extended support to March 2022. (Final agreement to be agreed);

(iv) FCN connectivity will be available for the duration;

(v) Windows 2012 & 10 will last until March 2022 (part of current R&R2 programme);

(vi) Horizon Anywhere Bluecoat appliances — assumed to last to 2022;

In addition, it is assumed that Fujitsu and Post Office will agree a change to the current
R&R2 programme (CT1848) to retarget RHEL7 - it is currently delivering RHEL6.

As a consequence of assumption (ii) above, it is agreed that Trinity 3 will need to be
reviewed to include any refresh and upgrade activities required to ensure hardware and
software (including operating systems) used remain in support through to 31% March
2023 and Post Office will be responsible for procuring (and paying for) any additional
hardware and software (including operating system).; and

(c) the extension of Test Rigs, as described and defined in CCN 1420a, to 31 March
2022.

Both Post Office and Fujitsu Services shall act reasonably in agreeing the above
projects.In the event that the Parties fail to reach agreement as to the commercial terms
and/or the relevant project is cancelled or the Test Rigs service is terminated, then to the
extent to which the Services are impacted by this failure and/or termination, such
Services shall be delivered by Fujitsu Services on a reasonable endeavours basis and all
associated Service Levels shall also become reasonable endeavours obligations.

1.2.3 Notwithstanding paragraph 1.2.2, both parties acknowledge that they may agree to an
alternative approach (both acting reasonably) to enacting a third R&R project and as such use
the capital investment from the Post Office in other ways. This shall be subject to the agreement
by both Parties and the default position shall remain (unless otherwise agreed) that where these
projects are not contracted or delivered, the delivery of the affected Service reverts to a
reasonable endeavours basis.

1.2.4 With respect to the Oracle database elements of the Data Centre Operations Services
only, in the event that the Oracle database goes out of Oracle extended support then the
provisions of paragraph 6.1 of Schedule D1 shall apply.”

FUJ00001132
FUJ00001132

Paragraph 2.1 shall be amended by deleting “in the column headed “Date or Event from which

Termination Notice can be given” and replacing it with “in the column headed “Date or Event

from which termination can be effective”.

The heading in paragraph 5.4 shall be amended so that the words “Transitional Support
Services” are replaced with the word “Services” so that the full heading reads as follows:

“5.4 Transfer upon Partial Termination, Termination or expiry of the Services”

The final sentence in paragraph 5.4.2(a) shall be amended by deleting the wording “... but Post
Office recognises that Fujitsu Services will be exiting the datacentre in September 2018 and as
such it will incur significant cost (which it will entitled to pass to Post Office for payment) in the
event that it is required to keep such data beyond 31* August 2018” . Consequently paragraph
5.4.2(a) as amended will read as follows:

“(a) following written confirmation by an authorised representative of Post Office (which
Post Office will not unreasonably withheld or delay), Fujitsu Services shall securely wipe
and destroy all data relating to Transactions or Events including the operational audit trail
and commercial audit trail), including the physical destruction of associated disks and
shall provide Post Office with a certificate of destruction within seven (7) days’ of the date
of destruction. Fujitsu Services shall be entitled to charge for the destruction of such
data and associated disks as an Exit service in accordance with the Rate Card. In the
event that such written confirmation is not received within 60 Working Days of the date of
termination or expiry of the associated Services then Fujitsu shall be entitled to charge
for continuing to hold the data.”

The first paragraph of paragraph 6.2 shall be amended to read as follows:

“6.2 Subject to paragraph 6.3, where a Termination Charge, Partial Termination
Charge or HNG-X Termination Charge is payable to Fujitsu Services, such payment shall
be equal to A + B + C where:”

Paragraph 6.2.1 shall be amended to read as follows:

“6.2.1 A shall be equal to the aggregate of all costs, reasonably incurred, associated
with the termination and, where relevant, transfer of the Relevant Services, that
cannot be reduced, abated, cancelled or applied elsewhere, subject to Fujitsu
Services using reasonable endeavours to mitigate the same, which may
include, but is not limited to, the termination of its personnel (where such
termination occurs prior to and excluding 2 April 2017) and any termination
charges payable to suppliers and sub-contractors and provided that:

(a) such costs are demonstrable and Fujitsu Services provides evidence of
such costs as requested by Post Office (acting reasonably);

() Post Office shall not be liable to make any payment in respect of such

FUJ00001132

costs to the extent that such costs are included within any fees already
paid by Post Office to Fujitsu Services in advance of the performance by
Fujitsu Services or to the extent that such costs exceed the amount that
Post Office would have paid under this Agreement had the relevant
termination not been made,

and which, without prejudice to the foregoing, shall include the remaining
lease charges (and dilapidations charges) payable by Fujitsu Services for
the Belfast data centres up to and including 31 March 2023);”

Paragraph 6.2.5(f) shall be amended to read as follows:

“Applicable Margin" means in the case of all Relevant Services save for any Expiring Services
which expire on the dates set out in Clauses 46.4.1 and 46.4.2 (where Termination Charges and
Partial Termination Charges do not apply):

*

10/100 of the Operational Charges from the Date of Termination to 31% March 2018
where Post Office terminates the Agreement on or before 31% March 2017. The
“Date of Termination” means termination of processing of Transactions either directly
or indirectly by the HNG-X System (or any replacement to such system provided by
Fujitsu Services) It is agreed that other Transfer Services, for example
decommissioning of equipment, provision of assistance including to the Next Supplier
and provision of documentation, may be provided after this date by Fujitsu Services.
Notwithstanding the provision of such Transfer Services after the Date of
Termination, the relevant Termination Charge or Partial Termination Charge shall be
calculated by reference to the Date of Termination; and

* 145/100 of the Operational Charges from the Date of Termination to 31% March 2023
where the Date of Termination is after 31% March 2017

save that whenever the notice to terminate by Post Office is given to Fujitsu Services in relation
to Expiring Services which do not expire on the dates set out in Clauses 46.4.1 and 46.4.2,
“Applicable Margin” shall mean 10/100

Insert a new paragraph 6.3:

“6.3 Where Termination Charges, Partial Termination Charges or HNG-X Termination
Charges are payable to Fujitsu Services under this Agreement, the sum of the
amounts payable by Post Office to Fujitsu Services calculated pursuant to
paragraph 6.2 plus any payments payable by Post Office under Clause 75.15.6
(having regard to the last paragraph of Clause 75.15) shall not in aggregate
exceed:

(a) £15,000,000 (fifteen million pounds), where Post Office terminates this
Agreement between 1 April 2021 and 31 March 2022 (inclusive); and

(b) £10,000,000 (ten million pounds), where Post Office terminates this
Agreement between 1 April 2022 and 30 March 2023 (inclusive).

FUJ00001132
FUJ00001132

For the avoidance of doubt, the Expiry Licence Fee and Termination Licence
Fee are not part of the Termination Charge and as such are not included in the
Termination Charge Cap.”

Insert a new paragraph 9.1.4

“As part of any termination or expiry of any Services it is agreed that as part of impacting the
remaining Services the Parties shall review the applicability of the Call Off Services in Table
B in Schedule B3.1.”

In paragraph 9.3 the words at the end of the first sentence “...and/or Transition Support
Services” shall be deleted.

Paragraph 10.C (inserted by CCN 1500a) shall be deleted and the following paragraph inserted:

“Both Parties acknowledge that Post Office may request further extensions to the Expiring
Services. Both Parties agree to act reasonably in the event of any such request and any
associated negotiation of terms. In particular, Fujitsu Services agrees to mitigate its costs of
supply and stranded costs with respect to any further extension of the Expiring Services to the
extent that it is reasonably possible to do so having regard to, amongst other things, the timing
of any request relative to the expiry date of the Expiring Services.”

Paragraph 11 shall be deleted.

Both Parties agree that the risk profile during the term of this Agreement should remain
broadly constant and that the hardware and software used to provide the Services should
be upgraded if required to remain within support. The responsibility for procuring
upgrades to hardware and software components remains with Post Office. As such Post
Office shall agree to maintain the risk profile broadly as at the date of the CCN 1600 and
that the hardware and software used to provide the Services should be upgraded if
required to remain within support via:

(a) arevision and re-planning work with respect to R&R2 project (CT1848) (such as
using Redhat 7 operating system to ensure security to 2022) , which shall be agreed by
the Parties via a further CT document;

(b) a third risk and resilience project (referred to as “Trinity 3”); the precise detail of which
is yet to be agreed upon completion of a technical roadmap, but shall broadly address
the following:

(i) refresh of Brocade SAN switches;

(ii) refresh of 15-30 discrete servers;

(ii) refresh or upgrade of Debit Card connectivity (BT withdraw kilostream technology
in 2018);

(iv) refresh or upgrade of Systems Management EFS servers (for HNGA Gaps
proposal);

(v) DC facilities chillers and security systems; and

(vi) Cisco and additional applications; and

and

(c) the extension of Test Rigs, as described and defined in CCN 1420a, to 31 March
2022.

Both Post Office and Fujitsu Services shall act reasonably in agreeing the above
projects.

In the event that the Parties fail to reach agreement as to the commercial terms and/or
the relevant project is cancelled or the Test Rigs service is terminated, then to the extent
to which the Services are impacted by this failure and/or termination, such Services shall
be delivered by Fujitsu Services on a reasonable endeavours basis and all associated
Service Levels shall also become reasonable endeavours obligations.

ANNEX B

TRINITY 3

PARTA

The items that need addressing as part of Trinity 3 are detailed below:

Refresh of Brocade SAN switches
Refresh of 15-30 Discrete servers

Refresh or upgrade of Debit Card connectivity (BT are expected to withdraw
kilostream technology in 2018)

Refresh or upgrade of Systems Management EFS servers (for Horizon Anywhere
Gaps proposal)

DC facilities chillers and security systems

Cisco and additional applications

In scoping “Trinity 3” the following assumptions were made:

i) the full deployment of Horizon Anywhere and the completion of the Branch
Network service migration to a third party by 31% March 2017 and the successful
completion of the R&R2 programme (as amended);

ii) An expiry date on the Agreement of 31% March 2022;

iii) Blades & Storage (expiry range 2019-2021) — Assumption is Fujitsu can secure
extended support to March 2022. (Final agreement to be agreed);

iv) FCN connectivity will be available for the duration;
v) Windows 2012 & 10 will last until March 2022 (part of current R&R2 programme);

vi) Horizon Anywhere Bluecoat appliances — assumed to last to 2022;

In addition, it is assumed that Fujitsu and Post Office will agree a change to the current
R&R2 programme (CT1848) to retarget RHEL7 - it is currently delivering RHEL6.

As a consequence of assumption (ii) above, it is agreed that Trinity 3 will need to be
reviewed to include any refresh and upgrade activities required to ensure hardware and
software (including operating systems) used remain in support through to 31% March
2023 and Post Office will be responsible for procuring (and paying for) any additional
hardware and software (including operating system).

Hi Ken,

Please can you upload this email to dimensions alongside CCN1600 and CT1848 as it
records the mutual agreement not to modify R&R2 (as described in CT1848) in the way
described in CCN1600 to enable the refreshed Redhat servers to be supportable to 2023?

Given the high cost of further refreshing the Redhat servers in future this email may be very

important to retain.

Thanks,

Alex Kemp,

Neil Hi
I was catching up with Ewan and Alex today re HDCR.
When we wrote the Trinity contract amendments we had a joint obligation to agree a
change to HDCR for the upgrade of REDHAT elements.

HDCR was upgrading the existing REDHAT versions to REDHAT 6 but as this is only
supported to 11/2020 it was agreed that we should change the target version to REDHAT
7 to get beyond 2023 in a supported form.

The idea for doing this change now, rather than in Trinity 3 was it would be cheaper now. 1
jump rather than 2 etc.

When we spoke about this a few months ago we agreed that discussing:Trinity:3 items was
not the best use of our time, and that additional spend now was not.the right approach and
I just wanted to confirm this given the obligation.

I am happy that we delay this, given the dates 6 gets us to-andithat the IT roadmap may
change the landscape by the time we get there.

Do you agree with approach in which case we will leave it as a potential item in the Trinity 3
scope/ timeline?

Best

Gavin
