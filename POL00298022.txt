Attachment: 20130725 board update on Horizon process.pdf

Apologies all, it should have been this version of the note attached to yesterday's email, which incorporates the insurance
information (at paragraph 31) rather than leave that in a standalone note. It also includes a couple of additional
sentences on accounting arrangements at paragraph 24.

Thanks,
Martin

Thanks Alwen

For the benefit of the other Board members I had a very good review with Susan and Alwen earlier this week focused
mainly on the history and immediate actions we are taking to dealing with the urgent case review. I was reassured by the
energy, resource and prioritisation of the work we are doing and I think it's fair to say on this we are working through as
quickly as is practical.

In our discussion with Susan, Alwen explained why the case review was only going back to 2010 and the significance of a
Horizon upgrade (full reconciliations across every site etc). Could Alwen please elaborate on this point as a critical issue
will be determining how far back we need to go.

Also what's the legal position with Fujitsu - do we think they are in any way culpable (and have we had our view verified)
and have we taken any action (noting that they have offered to pay£100k in support of costs)?

Finally I seem to be missing the insurance update - could you please resend.
