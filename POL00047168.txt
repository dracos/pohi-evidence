Further to my letter of 17 Novernber 2010. The Investigation Manager has considered the
Defence Statement and is of a view that there is no material that needs to be disclosed as
a result of the contents of that statement. However, you refer in the Defence Statement at
Paragraph 2, to further investigations which could have discovered the whereabouts of the
alleged missing sum. Could you explain what you mean by this staternent.

Yours faithfully
