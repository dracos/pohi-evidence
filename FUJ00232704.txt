On Monday, 19" of October, Fujitsu observed an Internet connectivity
issue, affecting the traffic since 16:17. The issue was affecting all Fujitsu
POA services using the Internet. Fujitsu NOC MIM Team investigated the
issue. Restoration of affected services started at approx. 17:30. The HSI
(High Speed Internet) router issue was confirmed to be the cause of a loss
of Fujitsu VPN, UMI and corporate Internet access. TCY02’S interfaces
shut down for an unknown reason, in addition a commissioning error with
CenturyLink meant that resilient routes were not available, resulting in the
loss of internet connectivity for some customers. This was diagnosed as
an error on the router by Juniper, which would be fixed by a planned
restart.

3 A recurrence of the router failure occurred at 11:51 BST on Wednesday,
Executive Summary 21st of October. It affected the same services as on Monday. Fujitsu NOC
MIM Team investigated the router on site and failed over the traffic, which
restored the connection at approx. 12:43. All affected services started to
recover at the same time. The team followed the recommended fix
supplied by Juniper and identified that the TCY02 chassis hardware
required a replacement.

The hardware was replaced at 23:30 BST on the 21st October and was
confirmed at 1:10 BST on the 22nd October the router was restored and
health checks performed to ensure all services were green.

The firmware upgrades and testing on the Fujitsu High Speed Internet
platform have been successfully completed on the 10° and 12" of
November.

On Monday, 19th of October since approx. 16:20, Fujitsu observed a
network connectivity issue. As a result, the entire Internet traffic was
affected which resulted in a loss of some POL services, which use Fujitsu
Internet. Fujitsu POA support and service teams also lost access to the
secure Fujitsu VPN (remote access) as a direct result.

ieldent Summary For the detailed impact of the incident, please refer to Services Impacted

and Overview of Service Impact 19.10.2020 sections of this report.

Fujitsu POA raised multiple high priority incidents for the affected services

from 16:28. For details of raised incidents, please refer to the Incident
Timeline. Investigation with POA technical resources was initiated via
bridge call at approx. 16:50, but with difficulties as most Fujitsu users are
working from home due to COVID-19 and were affected by no access to
the VPN due to the network issue.

During the Fujitsu POA bridge call, it was confirmed with POA Networks
Team, that we were facing a major network connectivity issue and
suspected onward Internet connectivity traffic has not failed over.
Acknowledged that the PODG file transfer is also impacted - POA UNIX
Team started to investigate this.

During the POA internal tech bridge call, it was confirmed that Banking,
Card Payments, EPOSS, Self-Service Kiosk service remain unaffected.
Some services failed over as expected.

At approx. 17:30, the POA users observed that the connection began to
be restored and affected services started to recover. Fujitsu were able to
resume the uploading of the PODG files at 17:31 following a manual
intervention by technical support.

At 17:37, Fujitsu Core Network and NOC ISP&DSL Teams confirmed to
Fujitsu POA that at 16:17, the HSI router in Fujitsu TCYO2 location
suffered an event causing it to stop responding, which affected multiple
Fujitsu customers. Fujitsu POA were informed that Fujitsu NOC Major
Incident Management Team is managing and investigating the issue since
observing the events on the router.

POA monitoring teams confirmed Track & Trace was the last of the
services to recover; this went green in HORIce (Fujitsu Monitoring Tool) at
19:20. This was owing to a major incident in Royal Mail Group domain
related to the business interface gateway that started at approx. 16:00 and
was confirmed as not related to the Fujitsu Network Incident.

A recurrence of the router failure occurred at 11:51 BST on Wednesday,
21st of October. It affected the same services as on Monday. Please see
details in Overview of Service Impact 21.10.2020 section of this
document. Fujitsu NOC MIM Team investigated the router on site and
failed over the traffic, which restored the connection at approx. 12:43. All
affected services started to recover at the same time.

The team followed the recommended fix supplied by Juniper and
identified that the TCY02 chassis hardware required a replacement.

The hardware was replaced at 23:30 BST on the 21st October and was
confirmed at 1:10 BST on the 22nd October the router was restored and
health checks performed to ensure all services were green.

The following actions were taken for resolution:

1. Correct the commissioning error with the CenturyLink connection

2. Source replacement Hardware for failing component (router
chassis)

2 problems :

Aratyale or one - A commissioning error with CenturyLink meant that resilient

routes were not available, resulting in the loss of internet
connectivity for some customers.

- A hardware issue requiring the chassis to be replaced on TCY02.

The HSI router in Fujitsu TCY02 suffered an event causing it to stop
responding, which resulted in a loss of Fujitsu VPN, UMI and corporate
Internet access.

Resilience is dependent on both CenturyLink and Cogent accepting all
Fujitsu’s public prefixes. The investigation identified that due to a
commissioning/configuration error, some of Fujitsu’s public prefixes were

Root Cause Analysis not being accepted by CenturyLink.

The result of this was that routes that should have been available via
CenturyLink to and from the internet were not.

The net result of this was that when the interfaces on TCY02 shut down,
customers who had a dependency on the subset of routes only available
via TCY02 lost Internet connectivity.

A hardware fault on TCY02 router chassis requiring a replacement.

The TCY02 router's interfaces were restored without intervention and
normal functionality resumed on Monday, 19" of October at 17:30.

POA UNIX removed the lockfiles on the PODG manually to allow the file
transfers, rather than waiting for the automated process to run.

Fujitsu NOC MIM Team expedited the planned changes and failed over
the traffic to the resilient path, which restored the connection on
Wednesday, 21* of October starting from 12:43.

The following actions were completed on the 21% October to restore and

Corrective Actions resolve the root cause.

- Correct the commissioning error with the CenturyLink connection

- Source replacement Hardware for failing component (router
chassis)

- Install replacement chassis and re-establish internet connections
All the above actions were completed by 01:23 on 22nd October.

The firmware upgrades and testing on the Fujitsu High Speed Internet
platform have been successfully completed on the 10° and 12" of

POA SSC resource confirmed regarding Track & Trace issue: Track & Trace
reporting is near real time - no impact on counter, the messages are queued and
sent to Royal Mail / Parcel Force. So if people check the barcodes - would be
delayed. The TT barcodes will be processed eventually

19:13

POA Unix confirmed that BIG (PODG) issue was sorted around 19:00. Related
TfSNow incident: INC6470271. Summary of the issue: After the network problems
in the afternoon, we had issues with the BAP_FILE_BIG PODG route. The route
was running very slowly with a single file taking 20-30 mins to transfer and be
renamed. This seemed to recover at approx. 19:00 with the backlog of files all
transferred at that point. We believe this was an issue at the BIG end

19:19

POA SMC confirmed Track & Trace returned to green in HORIce

19:50

Update from NOC Ops Manager: HS/ router at TCY02 had an event issue at
router 16:17 causing it to stop responding and caused a loss of service. When the
event occurred, some customer traffic rerouted via LD6 link instead but not all
services rerouted correctly. Services began to restore at 17:29 without intervention
from the Fujitsu third line engineers. Investigations are ongoing with Fujitsu third
line engineers and hardware supplier Juniper to understand the cause of the
outage. Juniper case has been logged and they have been provided with the event
logs, all technical information. The NOC will perform additional monitoring on the
HSI routers and escalate any potential issues immediately to the third line
engineers.

22:00

NOC update: AMCS third line support have confirmed that the case with 3rd party
Juniper has been accepted as a Severity 1. Juniper have performed initial
investigation and requested additional information from the device, which is being
supplied by AMCS third line support. Extended monitoring is now in place and will
continue overnight with AMCS third line support being contacted immediately any
performance issues are detected and a restart of the TCY02 router will be
undertaken. Further logs files would also be collected at this point to assist with
Juniper investigations. Further hourly status updates will be provided by AMCS
monitoring team.
