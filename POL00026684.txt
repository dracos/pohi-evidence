¢ SS stated that they were currently taking 2 months from receiving the Post Office Investigation
Report to complete Draft CRRs.

e SS confirmed that they had attended a meeting with POL earlier in the week re: scheduling. They
had agreed to complete five Draft CRRs per week until the end of October in order to clear the
backlog before returning to the standard rate of production - three a week - from November.

e SAH said that the recent Draft CRRs contained a greater level of detail that had been helpful in his
consideration.

e SAH said that JFSA had indicated that they did not want to be part of any discussion on the
decision whether a case should proceed to mediation. In doing so, they had declined to assist him
in the exercise of determining how to cast his deciding vote. JFSA stated that this did not apply in
cases that had not been recommended for mediation by SS. Thus far, SS had recommended all
cases for mediation.

e SAH requested that SS draw out in their Draft CRRs any material that had not been available at the
time, if there had been a guilty plea to theft.
