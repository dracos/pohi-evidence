gq Appendin A

This Appendix is divided into THREE sections:

* Section 1 reports those CCNs in the range 1 to 485 inclusive that were listed within
Addendum B of ICL Pathway Core System Release Plus, PA/STR/o13, Version 1.0,
2/7/99 (the RCD) and that were:

° To be applied at or after CSR+
. Candidates to be applied at or after CSR+

Columns 1 to 5 inclusive, including the shading in column 3
applicable to then unapproved items, are copied from the RCD. The
Resolution/Status Column records the current status and includes
the SADD head reference.

* Section 2 reports those Future Changes Required to the SADD that were listed
within Addendum C of the RCD and that were not associated with the Benefit
Payment Service.

Columns 1 to 6 inclusive are copied from the RCD. The
Resolution/Status Column records the current status.

* Section 3 reports those CCNs in the range 486 to the present that are
comprehended within CSR+. As yet unapproved CCNs are not comprehended in
CSR+. Columns 1 to 4 are based on the corresponding columns and rows from
SADD 5.4. Rows that are shaded in columns 1 to 4 denote CCNs that are not
comprehended in the functionality of CSR+ either because they are Rejected,
Withdrawn, or Approved but having no effect on functionality. In addition some
rows that are generally towards the end of the table are shaded because the CCN is
not yet Approved. Where the resolution column states “CSR+ dependency” the
CCN needs to be Approved in a timely manner to facilitate the orderly release of
CSR+. Where the resolution column states “Required at CSR+” the CCN, when
Approved, will be applied to CSR+ only during its lifetime.
