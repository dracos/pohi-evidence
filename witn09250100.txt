                                                                                    WITNO9250100
                                                                                  WITNO9250100

                                                              Dated: 13th June 2023



                         POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY




          FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF PAUL GRAHAM BOSSON




I, Paul Graham Bosson, will say as follow:-



Intrnrinctinn

   1. I am a former employee of Post Office Limited and held the position of Network

      Audit Manager.



   2. This witness statement is made to assist the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry (the

      "Inquiry") with the matters set out in the Rule 9 Request dated 15th May 2023

      (the "Request").




Background

   3. I joined the Post Office straight from school in 1977 where I worked for 2 years

      at the Crown Office in Reading.
                                                                                       W I TNO9250100
                                                                                 W I TN 09250100




4. In the following 4 years or so, I worked in the Accou nts Department, which dealt

   with the supply of cash and stock to Post Office Branches and also the return

   of items such as mutilated stamps; foreign coin; excess cash and claims for

   various allowances such as telephone calls and monthly charges.



5. I also worked for short spells in the Planning Department which dealt with

   monitoring of Post Office buildings and various projects such as build work;

   repairs; painting etc.



6. Following this, I moved to completing the Reading Head Office Cash Account

   each week, which also included summarising and submitting the Head Office

   Expenditure Schedule.



7. Around the early 1980's I joined the Audit Team in Reading which at that time

   covered Post Office Branches in the Reading Postcode area.



8. Following a Post Office reorganisation, I was promoted to an AuditManagerthe

   date of which I think was towards the end of the 80's. The role involved

   managing and developing a team of around8 auditors and scheduling audits of

   Post Office Branches, including Crown Offices each week in accordance with

   the annual audit plan. I remained in this role for around 20 years, during which

   time it was renamed to Network Audit Manager following another

   reorganisation.
                                                                                      W I TN09250100
                                                                                    W I TN 09250100




   9. I eventually moved to a new role which I thinkwas around 2005 dealing with

      Governance and Compliance auditing, which involved carrying out reviews on

      a range of procedures throughout the business.



   10. 1 eventually left the Business in 2011 after 33 years service.




The Audit Process & Policies/Practices in Place

   11.My role as Network Audit Manager primarily involved managing a team of

      around ten auditors ensuring they had the appropriate skills for their role. This

      would be achieved through ongoing on thejob training and monthly one to ones

      to address any skill gaps.



   12.As I recall, each month I would receive a list of Post Office Branches to be

      audited which had been identified as scheduled or risk audits. These branches

      would be scheduled for audit within the month received and would be

      undertaken by varying numbers of auditors, dependant on the size of the

      Branch. A Lead Auditor would be assigned to each audit who would be

      responsible for the planning and leading of the audit. Branches were generally

      closed whilstcash and stock items were reconciledto declared figures. In some

      cases, where satisfied that sufficient cash and stock had been counted and

      reconciled, the office was allowed to open to reduce the impact on customer

      service. The remaining value items to be counted and reconciled would be

      isolated and given access to the Branch on completion of this.
                                                                                      W I TNO9250100
                                                                                 W I TN 09250100




   13.The audit of the cash and stock used to be completed manually and recorded

      on an Audit Form, P32 which detailed all cash stock and vouchers checked to

      produce a Balance Due which should reconcile to the Branch figure. Any

      difference would represent the Branch surplus or shortage which Sub-

      postmasters would be requested to withdraw or make good which would be

      undertaken at the time of the audit. In cases where the discrepancy is proven

      to relate to a transactional error where a corrective error notice is due, the

      amountmay be held in uncharged receipts or unclaimed payments pending the

      receipt of this. In some circumstances where the amount of shortfall was such

      that the Sub-postmaster was not in a financial position to make good the

      amount, authority was sought from the Retail Network Manager to hold the

      amount in unclaimed payments pending a formal repayment agreement being

      made.



   14.An electron icversion of the Audit P32 was created and superseded the manual

      version, but I am unsure when this was introduced.


   15. In terms of the policies in place duringmytime as Network AuditManager, I am

      unable to recall whatwould have been in place and when/if theywere subject

      to change during that period.




Recruitment & Training of Auditors

   16. I have been asked to considerthe following documents, Assurance Review —

      Recruitment (Vetting & Training) version 1.0 dated 27 October 2009

      [POL00032698], Network auditing approach, methods and assurance dated
                                                                                        W I TN09250100
                                                                                  W I TN 09250100




   2013 [POL00086765], Training & Audit Advisor [POL00088453] and Loss

   Prevention - Audit Advisor [POL00088557].



17.Auditor vacancies were advertised and recruited internally. My recollection is

   that there were no restrictions regarding what teams/department they worked

   in, but generally it was beneficial to have an operational background such as

   working in a Crown Office or Cash Centre. Candidates would be subject to an

   interview process to determine their capabilities and suitabilityforthe role, with

   the best candidate being offered the post.


18. The successful candidate would be provided with induction training and on the

   job training with auditors within the team until both they and the Network Audit

   Manager were confidentthat their knowledge and skills were at a level where

   they could undertake audits on their own. This would always be at very small

   Branches. Generally, most audits required a staffing level of atleasttwo or more

   people, so support was always available to new recruits. Regular monthly one

   to ones and Performance Reviews addressed any concerns or issues had by

   the new recruit or Network Audit Manager, with additional training on any

   specific areas of weakness identified. Again ,this would be addressed by on the

   job training.



19.In my view even given the lack of an actual Audit training course, I had

   confidencethatAuditors had sufficienttrain ing and expertise to effectively carry

   out audits at Post Office Branches. All Auditors received monthly one to ones

   which reviewed performance and any knowledge gaps identified by the
                                                                                       W I TN09250100
                                                                                   W I TN 09250100




     individual or Network Audit Manager. This would be subsequently addressed

      with appropriate additional training as required.




The Planning & Scheduling of Audits

  20. 1 have been asked to consider document, Chapter 1 of the Audit Process

     Manual — Audit Plan & Scheduling version 8.0 dated 2010 [POL00084650].



  21. Post Office Branches were audited based on risk. My recollection is thatvarious

     risk models were usedto establish branchesthatposed the greatest risk. Audits

     could also be requested if concerns/issues are identified by various

     departments such as Security or the Finance department in Chesterfield. A

     monthly program of audits was produced, and audits were scheduled each

     month from this, with the higher risk branches prioritised first. Branches

     potentially could be subject to several audits each year depending on previous

     auditfindings or ongoing risk. From recollection, low risk branches could go up

     to 3 years withoutan audit. A percentage of randomly selected branches were

     also included for audit each year.


  22.A Branch profile usedto be held detailing hoursof opening; numberofindividual

     tills where appropriate; whether it conducted National Lottery/ Bureau de

     Change/ Car Tax; ATM machine; Stamp Vending machine or other

     products/services unique to certain branches which would be used in

     determining the staffing levelforthe audit. This was originallyin a paper format,

     butan electronicversion was later introduced butt cannotrecall when thiswas.
                                                                                     W I TNO9250100
                                                                                 W I TN 09250100




  23. In cases where Branches were scheduled following a request from the Security

     Team, discussions between the Lead Auditor and the Security Lead team

     member attending would be had to determine what the issue/concern was, and

     the approach required by the Security Team leader. Generally, these types of

     audits would mean the branch would remain closed until all issues had been

     resolved by the Security Team.



  24. 1 believe that Crown Offices were scheduled foraudit every 2 years or sooner

     if risks/issues were identified, as I would assume they wentthrough the same

     risk assessment as other Post Office Branches.




The Auditing Process

  25. I have been asked to consider various documents in relation to the auditing

     process   [P0L00083966, P0L00084801, P0L00087627, P0L00088252,

     P0L00084003, P0L00084813, P0L00085652, P0L00086765, P0L00086839

     and POL00087716].



  26.When completing an audit, a number of printouts were obtained from the

     Horizon system. This would be achieved by requesting the Sub-postmaster or

     Branch Manager with manager's access, to produce the required reports.

     Alternatively, as I recall, the Sub-postmaster or member of staff with managers

     access could be asked to create a User ID for the lead auditor to allow them

     access to the Horizon system to produce the required reports. In the absence

     of anyone being available with managers access to the Horizon system, a One-

     Shot password would need to be obtained via the Horizon Helpdeskto enable

     the Lead Auditor access to the Horizon system. As I recall this was the
                                                                                    W I TNO9250100
                                                                                 W I TN 09250100




   procedure for all audits. The following reports were obtained from the Horizon

   system —


      • Previous Branch Trading Statement (Reprint.

      •   Office Snapshot

      •   Overnight Cash Holding Declaration

      •   Suspense Account

      • Remittances In and Remittances Out

      • Reversals

      •   Transaction Corrections Processed

      •   Transaction Corrections Outstanding

          User Summary

      •   Transaction Log over£5k



27. In the event of an unexplained discrepancy being discovered on the auditwhich

   the Sub-postmaster could not explain, and could not be attributed to any

   obvious error in the transactions or cash and stock declaration completed by

   the branch in the week the audit was conducted, or there was evidence of

   fraudulent activity discovered, this would be escalated to the Security Team,

   Network Retail Manager, and the appropriate line manager of the Lead Auditor

   for advice and any ongoing actions.



28. Errors made in transactions reported from the branch would, once reconciled

   by receiving departments result in error notices being issuedto correct the error

   and enable the branch to offset losses or surpluses caused in theiraccounts as

   a result.
                                                                                   W I TNO9250100
                                                                                 W I TN 09250100




29. As previously mentioned in my statement, Sub-postmasters would be asked to

   make good losses or withdraw surpluses discovered on the audit. In cases

   where the discrepancy is proven to relate to a transactional error where a

   corrective error notice is due, the amount maybe held in uncharged receipts or

   unclaimed payments pending the receipt of this. In some circumstances where

   the amountof shortfall was such thatthe Sub-postmasterwas not in a financial

   position to make good the amount, authority was sought from the Retail Line

   Manager to hold the amount in unclaimed payments pending a formal

   repayment agreement being made. This wasa longstanding requirementas far

   as I recall and was in place when I first joined the Audit Team in 1977.




30. 1 do notrecall any incidents or need for an Auditorto take anyform of payments

   from a Sub-postmaster as any losses would be processed through the Branch

   account.



31. 1 cannot say for certain, but if a discrepancy was found on the audit, I can see

   no reason why a Sub-postmaster could not provide their own information or

   investigate   it   further   through   direct   contact    with   the   relevant

   department/agenciesto determine if any transactional errors had been made to

   account for the discrepancy at the Branch. Errors made in transactions

   submitted to the various departments would be identified in due course and

   correction (error) notices issued to the Branch.


32. If a Sub-postmaster was suspended as a result of a discrepancy found on an

   audit, given he would not have access to the relevant documents/information it
                                                                                     W I TNO9250100
                                                                                W I TN 09250100




   is unlikely that they would be able to pursue any enquiries of their own. My

   assumption would be that enquiries would be made by the Security team as

   part of their investigation.


33. At the start of the audit, Sub-postmasters would be appraised of whatwould be

   happeningduring theauditandwhatdocumentation would be requiredfrom the

   Horizon system. They would be asked to identify where all cash stock and

   vouchers were held, and to provide them to the Auditor. They would be advised

   that where possible the Branch would be reopened as soon as possible to

   minimise disruption to customers. If this was found to be not possible for

   example because cash declared by the Sub-postmaster did not accurately

   match that produced to the Auditors, this would be communicated to the Sub-

   postmaster. If a compliance audit is also being undertaken, the Sub-postmaster

   would be advised that questions would need to be asked to them and staff

   members. Throughout the audit the Sub-postmaster would be updated on

   progress. On completion of the audit, the result of the financial auditwould be

   advised to the Sub-postmaster and a close of meeting held to discuss findings

   and recommendations following the compliance audit.


34.Sub-postmasters were freely able to discuss with the Lead Auditor any

   concerns they may have regarding the audit or perhaps issues with staff

   members that gave them cause for concern. Where possible, issues would be

   resolved at the time or where necessary, referred to the appropriate Retail Line

   Manager or Secu rityteam foradvice or assistance. I do not recall any instances

   of having to do this in my time working in Audits.
                                                                                  W I TNO9250100
                                                                              W I TN 09250100




35. In the event of a Horizon system failure at a branch my understanding would

   be that a complete audit would not be possible due to the lack of available

   reports from the Horizon system. In the event of damage to the Horizon system

   through incidents such as fire where the building is deemed unsafe, assets

   would be removed to a secure location in sealed pouches and bags by Cash in

   Transit and held at a secure location. Where possible any documentation

   should be retrieved from the branch to assist in the completion of a P32 Audit

   ofAccounts.I have no recollection of incidencesofthisin mytime as an auditor.


36.The approach to Crown Office audits is differentto other branches given thatit

   is managed by Post Office managers who have responsibilities to undertake

   random spot checks of counter stocks held by Post Office staff members.

   Checks on audit would include any stocks held by the Branch Manager

   including where applicable Automatic Teller Machines (ATMs), Stamp

   machines. Additionally, any dormant unused stocks and a minimum of 50% of

   live counterstocks must be checked. An ystocks with a high cash on hand figure

   recorded should also be checked. Where time allows additional checks of live

   counter stocks can be made.


37. From recollection each Auditor had their own unique password to have limited

   access to the Horizon system when auditing a branch. In order to access the

   reports etc that they required; the Sub-postmaster would be required to add

   them to the Branch Users on Horizon where they would then log on using their

   password. On completion of the auditthe auditor would need to log out of the

   Horizon system and be removed by the Sub-postmaster from the user list.
                                                                                     W I TN09250100
                                                                                  W I TN 09250100




38. In the event that a Sub-postmaster or a person with manager access was not

   present at the Branch to add the auditorto the Horizon system a phone request

   is made on the day to the Horizon Helpdesk to obtain a one shot password

   which provides the Auditorwith additional access to the Horizon system which

   has the same as access rights of the Sub-postmaster or person with manager

   access. This level of access would also be required in the eventthat the Branch

   was closed or transferred.


39. Checks were carried out on the Office Horizon system as part of the audit

   process to determine if the Office Horizon User Listwas upto date and reflected

   the current staff at the branch, and if they held the correct user level. Sub-

   postmasters would be asked to ensure staff had correct user levels and to

   remove any staff no longer employed at the Branch.

40.1 have been asked to consider documents, AuditTrail Functional Specification,

   version 8.0 dated 18 October 2004 [FUJ00001894] and Global User Account

   dated September 2016 [POL00002841].



41.As I recall, although Icannotbe certain, Fujitsu hada limited role in the auditing

   of branches. The only involvementl believe was providinga one shot password

   on request to enable an Auditor access to the Horizon system to obtain various

   reports.


42. From memory I am not aware that Auditors had access to information thatwas

   not accessible to Sub-postmasters.
                                                                                      W I TN09250100
                                                                                  W I TN 09250100




   43. 1 have been asked to explain my understanding of an Audit Global User

      Account. I cannot remember and am not familiar with the Audit Global User

      Account during my time as Network Audit Manager.


Prosecution of Mr David Yates

   44.1 have been asked to set out my recollection of this case and to assist me to

      consider the following documents, my witness statement in the proceedings

      against Mr Yates [POL00066598], taped record of Mr Yates interview on 7

      March 2003 [POL00047494] and the Post Office Ltd Offender Report of Mr

      Yates [POL00061010].



   45.On the 6th March 2003, I received a telephone call from Mr Michael Dadra who

      was the Operations Manager within the Security &Audit Team. The call related

      to a previous auditthat had been conducted at Walton on Thames Post Office

      on the 15th November 2002. As I recall, I believe I would have been the Lead

      Auditoron this particular audit. Mr Dadra informed me that following post audit

      checks on remittances dispatched from Walton on Thames (which had been

      included in the audit), itwas discovered that they had notbeen received by the

      Post Office Cash Centre and had also not been recorded in the subsequent

      cash account submitted by Walton on Thames Post Office. This amounted to a

      discrepancy of £330,000.00.


   46.To clarify, Post Office branches, where required, receive cash from the Post

      Office Cash Centre and will receive sums of cash through various transactions

      throughout the day. In some circumstance, branches could receive large

      deposits of cash from local businesses. They will also throughoutthe day make

      cash payments to customers andclients, again through various transactions. In
                                                                                     W I TN09250100
                                                                                  W I TN 09250100




     some instances branches, wh ere cash deposits far out way the cash payments,

     will end up with excess cash, which would need to be remitted back to the Post

     Office Cash Centre. In some branches this could be quite significantamounts.




Audit of Walton on Thames Branch


  47. 1 have been asked to consider document, Memo from R Parker to David Yates

     re audit of Walton on Thames branch dated 21 June 2002 [POL00047328] and

     letter to David Yates from R Parker re finding of auditdated 26 November 2002

     [POL00047481] and to set out my involvement or awareness of the audits

     completed at the Walton on Thames Branch prior to 7 March 2003.



  48. In view of the findings following the audit conducted at Walton on Thames on

     the 15th November 2002, an auditwas arranged for Friday 7 March 2003. The

     audit was led by myself, and I was assisted by Sue Le May, an Auditor in the

     Audit Network Team. Sue Le May would have assisted me in the counting of

     cash and stock held at Walton on Thames.


  49. When we arrived at the branch at approximately 08.55am, Mr Yates was not

     present but one of his staff members was in situ preparing the branch in

     readiness for opening at 09.00am. I informed the staff member of our intention

     to auditthe branch, and that the branch would remain closed until a result had

     been reached. Shortlyafter, at around 09.05am, Mr Yates arrived whereupon

     apprised him of the process of the day as previously discussed with his staff

     member. I asked Mr Yates to printan Office Snapshotfrom the Horizon system

     which on examination indicated an overall cash holding of £410,354.67. I further
                                                                                      W I TN09250100
                                                                                   W I TN 09250100




   requested from Mr Yates, the previous days Over Night Cash Holding

   declaration (ONCH). On examination of this, it showed a total ONCH holding of

   £43,566.00 which was significantlydifferentto the figure indicated on the Office

   snapshot. I asked Mr Yates why there was such a large variance between the

   two, and he informed me that he had sent a remittance the previous day but

   had not yet processed it through the Horizon system. I asked Mr Yates to

   provide me with the Cash in Transit collection book, which bears the signature

   of the Cash in Transit collecting officer, evidencing thatthey had been received

   for dispatch to The Cash Centre. On examination of the CIT collection book

   there was no evidenceofa collection on the6th March 2003, the lastentry being

   the 5th March 2003.



50.1 further asked Mr Yates to provide me with the remittance under copies

   P5257MA, which would detail whatcash in denomination, had been remitted to

   the Post Office Cash Centre butheclaimed that hecould notfindthem. He then

   wenton to admitthatnoremittance had been despatchedthe previous day and

   subsequently we would find an audit discrepancy of £350,000.00.


51. Following these admissions by MrYates, I phoned the Operations Manager, Mr

   Michael Dadra and informed him of the position. He in turn then contacted Paul

   Dawkins, the Internal Crime Manager for that area, who arranged for Mr Dave

   Posnett and Mr Rob Fitzgerald to attend the branch and conductan interview

   with Mr Yates.


52. At th is point I documented details confirming the events thu s far. This was then

   signed by myself and Mr Yates and given to Mr Posnett on his arrival.
                                                                                       W I TNO9250100
                                                                                 W I TN 09250100




53. In the meantime, the audit of the branch continued in order to determine the

   true extent of the loss. This was achieved by a physical check of all cash, stock

   and vouchers on hand and compared to the office snapshot as provided by Mr

   Yates at the commencement of the audit, in order to verify they were present.


54. The audit revealed a total Branch shortage of £359,325.35 which was notified

   to Mr Posnett, and is broken down as follows —


   Cash shortage - £356,541.35

   National Lottery Tickets Disallowed (out of date)

   - £483.00

   Littlewoods Tickets Disallowed (out of date) - £650.00

   National Lottery Tickets Shortage -£208.00

   Net Shortages in Stock -E1987.84

   Charge Error Notice Accounted for on audit -f112.00

   Claim Error Notice Accounted for on audit +£512.28

   Previous weeks Declared Surplus not withdrawn

+f144.20



55. The size of this audit shortage was by far the largest I encountered during my

   audit career. At the time I would not have been aware of the circumstances that

   caused it, as this was for the Security Team to determine in interview, and to

   pursue any further enquiries.



56.1 cannot recall what ARQ logs are and who would have been responsible for

   obtaining them from Fujitsu or indeed if they were obtained.
                                                                                      W I TN09250100
                                                                                    W I TN 09250100




   57.Although I cannot recall, it is very Iikelythat i would have spoken to Mr Posnett

      regarding the previous audits performed at Walton on Thames and that it was

      highly likely that Mr Yates produced bogus CIT receipts and P5257MA

      documentsto conceal a discrepancy. It is unclearasto why this was not picked

      up following post audit checks of outward remittances.


   58. Retail Network Managers are responsible for the decision to suspend Sub-

      postmasters, so in this instance ElaineWrightwould havesuspended MrYates.


  59. Following th is decision, we were advised by Elaine Wright to secure all cash,

      stock and value items in the Branch safes pending arrangements being made

      for the branch to be transferred to a temporary Sub-postmaster.


  60. 1 have been asked to consider document, Memo from Paul Bosson to David

      Posnett dated 4 September 2004 [POL00066457]. Following the audit on 7

      March 2003, I completed an audit report to Dave Posnett and copied in Elaine

      Wright, Retail Line Manager, detailing my findings on the audit of Walton On

      Thames. A further copy would have been submitted to my line manager Mr

      Martin Ferlinc for information. This is normal policy in the event of an audit

      involving the Internal Crime Team.


  61. 1 am not aware at what point Mr Yates was charged. As I recall the only

      involvement following theauditatWalton On Thames was to provide a witness

      statement on the 7th July 2003.

                                                                                 W I TN 09250100




62. Prior to this case I do not recall if I was involved in any proceedings against

   Sub-postmasters, their managers or assistants, or Post Office employees

   relating to shortfalls shown on the Horizon IT system.



63. 1 cannot recall who would have asked me to provide a witness statement, but it

   would most likely have been someone from the Internal Crime Team. My

   assumption is itwouldhavebeen Mr Posnett, butthis may not necessarily have

   been the case. I cannot recall who if anyone I had contact with when drafting

   my statement or any discussions that may or may not have taken place.


64. 1 do not recall if any discussions were had with Counsel or POL Legal

   representatives regarding my role as witness. As far as I am concerned my role

   in this case was to describe the events leading up to, and during the audit

   performed at Walton On Thames, which subsequently led to the audit

   discrepancy discovered.


65. From what I recall, the prosecution seemed to followthe usual process and was

   conducted in the same way as any other.


66.1 am sure I would have been informed of the outcome of the case against Mr

   Yates. I am not surprised at his guilty plea given the admissions he made in his

   statement that he had used POL funds to pay for staff wages and bills. As

   regards to his sentence, which I believe was a 3 year prison sentence, I was

   not really surprised given the amount of discrepancy involved in this case.


67. 1 have been asked to considertheJudgmentoftheCourtofAppeal in Josephine

   Hamilton & Others v Post Office Limited [2021] EWCA Crim 577

   [POL00113278] and my reflections on the investigation that was done in Mr
                                                                                            W I TNO9250100
                                                                                       W I TN 09250100




      Yates case. Reflecting on the case against Mr Yates, it seems that despite his

      admissions that he used POL cash for personal use, there seems to be a

      sign ificantu nknown sum of money that related to unexplained losses reported

      on the Horizon system over a numberof years which does not appear to have

      been investigated furtherto determine how orwhy they occurred.




Knowledge of bugs errors and defects in the Horizon system

   68. During my time working in POL, I did not have any reasons for concern

      regarding the robustness of the Horizon system, as I accepted that given it had

      been thoroughly tested prior to roll out, that it was reliable and fit for purpose.

      am not aware of any instances where concerns were raised to me by anyone

      including members of my audit team regarding the integrity of the Horizon

      system. In the event that concerns had been raised by POL regarding the

      Horizon system they should have been communicated to the audit teams

      across the country as well as Retail Line Managers and the Internal Crime

      Team.



   69.Auditors in my team would not have been instructed to ignore Horizon issues if

      they were raised as possible reasons for shortfalls. In the event of any such

      concerns being raised on an audit, the auditee should have in my view, been

      advised to speak to their Retail Line Manager who is responsible for the

      managing of the Branch.




Other Matters
                                                                                       WITNO9250100
                                                                                    WITNO9250100




   70. I have completed this statement as honestly and as accurate as possible. As

       you can appreciate this refers to a case over 20 years ago and remembering

       events and policies during that time is quite challenging for someone like myself

       who has a poor long term memory. Many of the documents provided to me are

       dated after I moved from my role of Network Audit Manager and after I left the

       Post Office.
