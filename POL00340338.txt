Post Office Limited (POL) customer transactions are captured through the Horizon Electronic Point of Sale equipment in branches, with daily summaries
transmitted to the central accounting system, POLSAP. The translation process between the two systems is enabled by SAP Middleware. The POLSAP
‘system was implemented in 2005/06 and contains functionality to calculate branch balances (cash, stocks, suspense, debtors and creditors) and to settle

client balances.
The overall objective of the review was to assess the degree to which the issues raised in the 2011/12 Ernst & Young (E&Y) Management Letter regarding,

the POLSAP control environment have been addressed. Where actions have not been completed, or were completed part way through the financial year
2012/13, any existing compensating controls were also assessed.

1. Change management: The policy is under development, but has not been formally agreed and communicated as at February 2013.

2. Password parameters: Whilst 2 number of password parameters have been changed in line with the E&Y recommendations, the password parameter
for account lockout has not been strengthened.

Implication: Inappropriate access may be obtained, leading to inappropriate activities being undertaken within the system.
Conclusion: The majority of areas for improvement identified by ERY have been completed, or where areas for improvement had not been
implemented, it was either demonstrated that compensating controls have been in operation for the whole of the financial year 2012/13 or the risk
related to not implementing the proposed changes was accepted by the POL Risk and Compliance Committee. Three areas have been partially
implemented and require some further work to complete the recommendations. The findings, summarised on pages 3 ~ 7 have been shared with E&Y
and reflect the IA&RM assessment as at February 2013.
