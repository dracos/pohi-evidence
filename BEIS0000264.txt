CONTRIBUTION TO BRIEFING FOR PATRICIA HEWITT'S MEETING
WITH ICL ON TUESDAY 2 NOVEMBER 1999

You have asked for a contribution to briefing for Patricia Hewitt's meeting with
Keith Todd and George Hall of ICL on Tuesday 2 November.

I understand the main topics of discussion at the meeting will be Electronic
Government and the Information Age initiative. However, Ms Hewitt may wish to
use this opportunity to convey some messages to ICL concerning the Horizon post
office counters automation project. I therefore attach at Annex A lines to take and
a background note on current progress with the project.
