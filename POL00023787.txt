See below. You'll see Lord Neuberger confirms he agrees with Lord Grabiner's assessment of the
Judgment (the "treacle" comment) and then comments on football...and sent from an iPhone.

I will have to rebalance my views of life.

T
Tony,
ft agree with you re the judgment.
And I agree with Tom Beezer re the football but I am not sure that you are onside with
that opinion.

Tom/Rob,
Treat this as my broad ‘yes that is ok’.

I’m still wading through the treacle of this mad judgment. I don’t understand what he
thought he was doing or what he thought he was supposed to be doing. The constant
repetition of the mantra that he wasn’t deciding anything outside of the common issues
is hardly credible. I’ve yet to get to the many other matters but I can see from Gideon’s
note and from the various quotes that it just gets worse.

Tom - if you need t
