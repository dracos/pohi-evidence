Any request for evidence supporting any form of litigation must be made via a defined route. That route is from the security department in
POL to the Fraud and Litigation service within the CSPOA Security team. This is the only route that can be used for evidential purposes
because the data handling conforms to the required legal rules for evidence.

CSPOA Security will make contact with the Police, and if necessary with POL lawyers. CSPOA Security team may request that SSC staff
provide some technical input to the process. CSPOA Security do not notify POL as to who provides input into their general processes. They
have confirmed that no member of SCC will be required to raise and sign any statements of witness as to their activity in such matters and
nor will any pressure be brought to bear on SSC staff to do so. If a request is made for a statement of witness you should immediately inform
the SSC duty manager.

In particular - if it is believed that a piece of hardware (e.g. counter, disk) is required from a Post Office in order to assist with litigation, then
it must NOT be brought to the SSC. In many cases SSC staff have the ability to break some security seals for diagnostic purposes and so the
item would not pass the strict audit requirements for litigation.
