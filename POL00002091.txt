@ Post Office data centres are connected to
lots of different transaction providers
around the world.

@ Fujitsu monitor the transactions and
network connections (where allowed) to
identify failure events.

@ Failures with external providers can cause
particular transaction types to become
unavailable on Horizon.

® @ Transactions are reconciled overnight.

™ Post Office employees can access reports
to analyse transactions.

Resilience Introduction FUJITSU

m ‘the ability to provide and maintain an agreed level of service in
the face of faults and challenges.”

™ Given the volume of equipment used to support the Horizon
service resilience incidents happen at predictable frequency
(e.g. hard fault on a network circuit every 6 years).

@ Resilience loss resolved by Incident Management Process.

Horizon Resilience Levels FUJITSU

Immediate/Automatic - for
components necessary for PO
branch trading. Horizon
design target is that any
required automatic failovers
complete within 2 minutes.

m Intermediate - for components which are not used in PO
branch trading, but are still essential for daily operations.
(typical recovery time within 2 hours).

m™ Longer Term - for components with negligible impact to live
service. This might include test rigs, provisioning servers, or
cryptographic key generation workstations.

QL/SS6/4

POL00002091
POL00002091

3 types of Immediate/Automatic failover FUJITSU

LVISS6/4

m N+1. N servers are capable of handling the full workload, with N+1
deployed; an intelligent switch (e.g. Cisco ACE) probes each server to
confirm if service is available — then distributes requests across all
active instances.

m Active/Standby pairs. Active and warm standby servers are each
capable of handling the full workload. They exchange heartbeat
messages and the standby will only take over if it decides that the
active server has failed.

® Clustering. A cluster is configured using a chosen technology (e.g.
Oracle Database); such that should a cluster member fail, remaining
servers will automatically take over the workload.

Problem Summary

Counter Transaction Perfomance

Last week we analysed the milliseconds each transactiontakes
and found anissue in the recent version of the IBM Tivoli
software that has a fiected counter transaction performance

Problem
Description

. Most of the counters now have this version of the software We
are still well inside SLA butit is not as gptemum as we would
usually prefer.

The issue was not happening all the time so PMs would
perceive periods where their counter would appearto go slowly
and then speed up again.

Impact

When a counter (with the new version) would experience over
doubling of transactiontimes. The transactions were still
completing and nottiming out.

agree impacts and limitations of software actions Bansal, Steve 27/06/2012 09:17 00:10:02 Log Comment POA-Horizon A
workshop has been held on this issue and a resolver group have reviewed the issue.

MSS (JA, SBM,AC), SMG (MC), SMC, RM (JB), Test (BS, MW) and Integration (MS)

The current work around will remain in place with a clear set of working instructions.

Actions

1) MSS - To produce a work instruction for support teams to toggle notifications on and off. This will take into account MSS
work shift patterns.

2) RM - To provide MSS with Release Note instructions for all composite products, to pre cache products that need to be. This
will go through LST testing.

Bansal, Steve 27/06/2012 08:55 00:00:35 Log Comment POA-Horizon Fujitsu response back 25/06/12

The newer Tivoli version has been in distribution for the past few months and is nearly complete.

Our workaround is that we have changed the scheduling for how jobs are loaded for the overnight software distribution.
Collecting the notification of new scheduled jobs causes an unexpected performance issue in the newer version. The
scheduling of work is a human function and the counter impact happens a bit later. There are some days where no jobs are
scheduled so there is no impact. The actual jobs are running out of hours as per the older version.

Bansal, Steve 27/06/2012 08:51 00:01:32 Log Comment POA-Horizon Fujitsu response 25/06/12

Last week we analysed the milliseconds each transaction takes and found an issue (that Mark Gordon has briefed Dave
Hulbert about) in the recent version of the IBM Tivoli software that has affected counter transaction performance. Most of the
counters now have this version of the software. We are still well inside SLA but it is not as optimum as we would usually
prefer.

We are getting feedback regarding transaction speeds.
