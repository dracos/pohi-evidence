Subject: RE: Full Review - Misra - NEW INSTRUCTION

Chris ~ thank you for sending this over.

I note that because the full prosecution file was not available to Simon when he produced his note, he undertook his
review and based his advice on the information he was able to extract from the trial transcripts.

Through the disclosure exercise we are undertaking in response to the CCRC’s review of Ms Misra’s prosecution, we
have now obtained a substantial number of prosecution documents which concern the disclosure made in the
prosecution, including in response to Defence challenges about Horizon reliability. These documents can now be

reviewed through the Millnet dataroom set up to facilitate the disclosure of material to the CCRC.

jalso attach two internal Fujitsu documents concerning a “Receipts-Payments Mismatch issue”, which documents came
to light through the investigation work undertaken with Second Sight Support Services Ltd.

Conscious of Past Office’s continuing duty of disclosure in criminal cases, I wonder whether Simon should revisit his
advice in the context of the attached notes and original prosecution documents. As noted above, the documents
available for review in the Millnet dataroom are substantial (c.2,000), and therefore I would be grateful if Simon could
please contact me to discuss and agree the approach to this once he has had a chance to consider this email.

{will also need in due course an eSRF to cover your firm’s costs of undertaking this work.

Please let me know me if you need to discuss anything further.

Kind regards, Rodric
