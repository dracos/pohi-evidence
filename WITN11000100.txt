Background
5. I have been asked to set out a summary of my career and qualifications prior

to joining ShEx. | hold a Bachelors of Arts in Business Studies from Trinity
College, Dublin and a Masters of Economics from LSE. | am a Fellow of the
Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland. During my career, | have worked
for a number of financial institutions including Bank of America, Barclays, and
Zurich Financial Services Group (where | was CFO before being promoted in
2007 to Vice Chairman). | began my non-executive career in 2007 when | was
appointed as Senior Independent Director at Man Group (until 2012), and as
a non-executive director and Chair of the Audit Committee of Collins Stewart
(until 2009). Upon retiring from Zurich Group in 2009, | focused exclusively on

my non-executive roles.

6. I joined the Bank of Ireland as the non-executive chair of the audit committee
in 2009, and subsequently became the Deputy Governor of the Bank of Ireland
in 2011, which was also a non-executive position. The Secretary of State
appointed me as Chair of the ShEx Board in October 2011, with a start date of
March 2012. The time commitment for each of these roles was one day a week
and two days a month respectively. | resigned as Chair of the ShEx Board in

September 2014.

7. My understanding is that a key aspect to my appointment was my expertise in
corporate management and my experience in senior executive positions of a
number of companies, which was of obvious relevance to ShEx which
exercised the shareholder role for many different assets. | did not sit on any

other subcommittees at ShEx. There was a large degree of corporate finance

DocuSign Envelope ID: F7F45FD2-14DA-4F78-8D4D-E4D6D52EDE7D
WITN11000100

and corporate management expertise both on the Board and within ShEx more

broadly.

8. I joined Old Mutual plc as the non-executive chair in 2010. | worked four days
a week at Old Mutual plc. From 2013 to 2018, | was also chair of Lloyds
Syndicate 218. | remained in my position at Bank of Ireland until 2015 and
remained in my position at Old Mutual Plc until we broke up the company in
2018. | was chair of the Board at Saga plc from 1 May 2018 until October
2020. Since February 2023, | have been an advisor (part-time) to the

Cambridge Institute for Sustainable Leadership in respect of Board practice.

The Government's interest in POL

9. I have been asked to describe the Government's interest in Post Office Limited
(‘POL’) for the period in which | was engaged by ShEx. In April 2012, POL
became a public corporation, separate from Royal Mail and owned 100% by
the Government, specifically the Secretary of State of the Department of

Business Innovation and Skills (“BIS”).

10. The Secretary of State for BIS (as shareholder), at the time, had ultimate
responsibility for the Government’s shareholdings in Royal Mail Group and
POL. The Secretary of State could not delegate his responsibilities. The
Secretary of State was not responsible for the day-to-day oversight of POL.
The Permanent Secretary, who was Martin Donnelly, had accountability as

Accounting Officer for POL.

11. The Secretary of State, in my view, cannot have been expected to have taken

any more of an active role in overseeing the day-to-day operations of Royal

Page 3 of 30
WITN11000100
WITN11000100

DocuSign Envelope ID: F7F45FD2-14DA-4F78-8D4D-E4D6D52EDE7D
WITN11000100

Mail Group and/or POL. This reflects usual practice — the role of a shareholder
is not to manage the operations of the company. Nor was it the function of BIS
(or ShEx, as an organisation within BIS) to be responsible for the operations
of Royal Mail Group and/or POL. Responsibility for the company’s operations
was with the POL Board, comprised of senior management and independent
non-executive directors, including a representative of the Secretary of State,

through ShEx, the Shareholder NED.

11.1. Moreover, ShEx did not have the expertise to run commercial enterprises such
as Royal Mail or POL. ShEx was comprised largely of former corporate
financiers, civil servants, or other professionals. The role of ShEx was to
exercise the shareholder function (as described in further detail below) and
provide advice via the Permanent Secretary to the relevant Minister, including
in respect of POL. ShEx had access to external advisors (such as Rothschilds
in the context of the Royal Mail Group float), and the expertise and experience

of the ShEx Board to assist it in this task.

12. Use of arm’s-length bodies (“ALBs”) is the preferred modus operandi for
Government owned entities. There are many benefits to the ALB model, which
I need not rehearse here as others who have been called by the Inquiry to give
evidence will be able to speak to this in more detail. The key point is that for
the objectives of the ALB model to work as regards POL, it must be able to
operate on a truly arm’s-length basis, such that Government does not interfere
with operational and/or contractual matters. In addition, the Government
would be unlikely to have the expertise necessary to run commercial

operations such as POL.

WITN11000100
13. It is nonetheless critical that government-owned corporations have the correct

and appropriate scrutiny; they should be held to essentially the same corporate
governance standards as listed companies. By the Government shareholder
having a representative on the POL Board and by having the ShEx Team
(defined below) monitoring POL, there was arguably greater scrutiny on POL

than that which publicly listed companies might experience.

Organisation of ShEx and strategy of oversight

14, As | have said, it is not for central Government to micro-manage the operation
of large commercial entities such as POL and there are good and obvious
reasons why ALBs should be given the autonomy, subject to the oversight of

their boards, to take decisions in the best commercial interests of the business.

15. ShEx’s function in this respect was to assist with the shareholder role of
different entities within the Government's portfolio (i.e., where it was the sole
or major shareholder). Within ShEx, separate teams were established to
exercise this function in respect of different assets (the “ShEx Team’), and this

includes the management of the Secretary of State’s shareholding in POL.

16. The ShEx Team would liaise directly with Ministerial outer office staff to brief
the Minister on specific issues relating to POL as they might arise. In my view,
the ShEx Team’s relationship to BIS was as an advisor which was embedded
within the Department. Ministers were also advised and assisted by BIS civil
servants (including their Private Offices) and Special Advisors (SpAds).
Requests from Ministers were routine and would have been responded to by

the ShEx Team as appropriate.

17. I have had the benefit of reviewing the First Witness Statement of Mr Charles

Donald dated 19 February 2024 (WITN10770100). Paragraph 9 describes
ShEx’s shareholder role in detail, and appears to me to provide a good and
accurate summary. | would add that the ShEx Team’s exercise of the
shareholder role had (necessarily) more political considerations than in a

normal publicly listed company.

18. I also note paragraphs 26 and 27 of Mr Donald’s First Witness Statement
(WITN10770100), where Mr Donald describes the responsibilities of the ShEx
Team, and the way that these were exercised. | consider that these paragraphs
broadly reflect the responsibilities of the ShEx Team during my tenure as Chair,
although the granular detail would not have been evident to me in my role as
Chair of the ShEx Board, nor would | have had visibility on, for example, the

frequency of monitoring meetings with POL or the nature of the issues covered.

The ShEx Board

18.1 The ShEx Board was not a corporate board (i.e., where directors have
statutory fiduciary duties under the Companies Act 2006); it was an advisory
board. The role of the ShEx Board was to oversee the executive below it, this
included considering any specific issues referred to the ShEx Board by the

executive.

18.2 Whilst there were no statutory duties imposed on the ShEx Board under the
Companies Act 2006, we tried to mirror standard governance processes. |
have been shown ShEx Board’s Remit dated August 2010 and Shareholder
Executive Terms of Reference dated October 2009 (UKGI00041953) and,

although | do not recall whether | saw this document during my tenure as Chair,

Page 6 of 30
WITN11000100
WITN11000100

DocuSign Envelope ID: F7F45FD2-14DA-4F78-8D4D-E4D6D52EDE7D
WITN11000100

I consider this document, and in particular paragraphs 6 and 7, accurately

reflects the responsibilities of the ShEx Board, and how it functioned.

18.3. The ShEx Board was comprised of both executive directors and non-executive
directors, with the majority of the ShEx Board being non-executive directors.
As | have noted above, there was a large degree of corporate finance and

corporate management expertise on the ShEx Board.

19. I have been referred to the letter appointing me as Chair of the ShEx Board
dated 4 October 2011 (UKGI00045855). Paragraph 3 of this document sets

out that my remit as Chair was to:

19.1 lead the Board of Directors, ensuring their effectiveness in all aspects of their

advisory role;

19.2 lead bi-monthly Board meetings in determining future strategy and direction for

ShEx;

19.3 facilitate, promote, and ensure the effective contribution of all Executive and
Non-Executive Directors and ensure that constructive relations exist between

them;

19.4 develop a constructive, frank, and open relationship with the CEO of ShEx,

holding them accountable for the effective implementation of decisions;

19.5 be actively available for the continued mentoring and support of ShEx

colleagues;

19.6 maintain and develop successful relationships with the Chairs of portfolio

businesses and to offer mentoring where appropriate; and

WITN11000100

DocuSign Envelope ID: F7F45FD2-14DA-4F78-8D4D-E4D6D52EDE7D
WITN11000100

19.7 maintain and develop robust relationships with the Permanent Secretaries and

senior Government Officials of HM Treasury, the Cabinet Office, and No.10.

20. I consider that this document accurately reflects my remit as Chair, and would

add that:

20.1. In the exercise of my role I (and the rest of the ShEx Board) would have regard
to the fact that Government ALBs such as POL had policy considerations to
take into account, rather than just commercial factors. For example, if POL
was simply a commercial business it would likely have closed a significant
number of branches which were not profitable. However, the geographical
reach of the Post Office network is of fundamental importance to the
Government, and its funding of POL is closely linked to POL’s assurances to

maintain a minimum number of sites;

20.2 In addition, | and the rest of the ShEx Board would advise the executive on (i)
strategies of the companies in the portfolio, such as POL’s 5-year strategy and
mutualisation proposal; (ii) other asset specific issues; and (iii) remuneration
and appointment of senior individuals of companies in the portfolio. Asset-
specific issues for the Board’s attention would generally have been flagged by

the ShEx CEO, usually in the CEO’s report to the Board.

20.3 In terms of my meetings with others, this would include:

20.3.1 twice a year with the chairs and CEOs of the ALBs — this included the

POL Chair and CEO;

20.3.2 quarterly with the ShEx representatives on the boards of the

companies in the portfolio. These discussions included covering any

WITN11000100
WITN11000100

DocuSign Envelope ID: F7F45FD2-14DA-4F78-8D4D-E4D6D52EDE7D
WITN11000100

outcomes from the discussions with the Chair of the company, and
also whether the Chair had any issues with the ShEx representative
on the board. | do not recall Alice Perkins, as Chair of POL, ever

raising any such issue with me; and

20.3.3 discussions with the individuals running the ShEx Teams, to the
extent there were issues. To this end | made myself visible as Chair,
and sat out on the office floor to make it clear that the ShEx Teams

could approach me as needed.

21. During my time as Chair, the key priorities for ShEx were (i) the float of Royal
Mail; (ii) the decommissioning of the nuclear site (Sellafield); (iii) the sale of
URENCO; (iv) the set-up of the Business Bank; and (v) the Green Investment
Bank. Each of these matters had huge public interest and significance and
were rightly a key focus of ShEx’s attention. In terms of POL, the focus for the
ShEx Team and its Board would have been the key issues in POL’s 5-year
business plan and the objectives set out within this, mutualisation, and

Government funding.

22. I cannot recall anything specific, relating to POL, other than the 5-year plan,
mutualisation, and funding, being raised by the ShEx Team or the ShEx CEO
to the ShEx Board. ShEx reviewed Board appointments and remuneration
recommendations for POL. When POL wanted a new remuneration plan, that
came to ShEx and it was reported to the ShEx Board. As far as | am aware,
save for senior roles such as POL’s CEO and board members, ShEx was not
involved in the management of personnel. ShEx was not involved in

contractual management, again, in line with the arms-length approach to POL.

DocuSign Envelope ID: F7F45FD2-14DA-4F78-8D4D-E4D6D52EDE7D
WITN11000100

There were delegated limits of £50million in relation to procurement and
contractual spend. Over that threshold required shareholder approval, but |am
not aware of any other restrictions. POL also needed to seek approval from
the shareholder if they were proposing spend on items/services that were
outside of their agreed business plan. | cannot recall there being any instance
where there was such a significant change in POL’s strategy that it was felt

that it needed to be raised with the ShEx Board.

23. I did not have a role in the work within POL to establish an independent board
and prepare for separation. As | have said, | joined as Chair of the ShEx Board

in March 2012, right before POL’s separation from Royal Mail in April 2012.

24. The culture at ShEx was open, with a willingness to lean on any available
expertise. During the Royal Mail switchover period, | recall having in-depth
conversations with Roger Lowe, Director of the ShEx Royal Mail and POL
Team, on a frequent basis, about how things were going. These conversations

focused on the Royal Mail float, with less time spent on POL.

25. lam asked what external oversight there was of the ShEx Board. | recall that
there was a Treasury appointee on the ShEx Board (Jeremy Pocklington).
There was also a variety of reporting to the Secretary of State and to BIS, but
the previous ShEx CEOs who have been called by the Inquiry will be able to

speak to this in more detail.

26. | am asked to address matters that go to reporting and risk structures within
ShEx. These evolved over time, and | understand the evolution of these

matters will be addressed fully by other UKGI witnesses to the Inquiry.

WITN11000100
Internal ShEx structures
27. As | have said above, the ShEx Team monitored the corporate and financial

performance of POL. Each ShEx Team was led by an Executive Director, who
in turn reported to a Director. There were approximately 30 Executive Directors
and four Directors during my time as Chair. The ShEx Team reported to the
ShEx CEO who would determine whether an issue needed to be brought to

the attention of the ShEx Board.

The Shareholder NED

28. One way in which ShEx fulfilled its shareholder function was by taking a seat
on the Board of the Government’s major ALB companies, including POL, as a
Non-Executive Director (the “Shareholder NED’). This Shareholder NED, who
was bound by the same duties as any other NED (as prescribed by the
Companies Act 2006) reported into the ShEx CEO and/or ShEx Team, as

permitted.

28.1 Susannah Storey was the Shareholder NED on the POL Board during my term.
The Shareholder NEDs had a dual role. This means that, on the one hand the
role of the Shareholder NED was to exercise governance over the asset as a
board representative and on the other hand to communicate the day-to-day
Government perspective to the asset (though the Government's key priorities
were already set out in a letter to the Chair of the POL Board), and provide an
additional line of sight to ShEx on issues being raised within the asset. The
Shareholder NEDs were a good liaison back to the Government and were

important to translate the POL Board’s views on key issues back to ShEx. In

Page 11 of 30
WITN11000100
WITN11000100

DocuSign Envelope ID: F7F45FD2-14DA-4F78-8D4D-E4D6D52EDE7D
WITN11000100

my view, Susannah Storey had influence because of her previous work with

Royal Mail, and her contacts within Royal Mail.

29. In terms of any codes or principles of governance, | do not believe that there
were any specific codes in place over and above the application of the FRC
combined code of corporate governance and the Companies Act 2006. | have
been taken to section 2.1 of the ShEx Handbook (UKGI00044314), which sets
out that it was expected all ShEx assets would comply with the FRC combined
code of corporate governance. This accords with my recollection. The ShEx
Handbook also contained principles which the Government expected ALBs to
adhere to, including that governance should reflect commercial best practice
and there should be an open and honest dialogue between the ALB and

Government as shareholder. This accords with my understanding.

30. Taking into account that (a) the ShEx Team monitored POL’s strategy and
milestones against POL’s business plan, and fed into internal and
Departmental reporting; (b) the company’s Chair met with the ShEx Chair twice
a year, as well as meeting with the Ministers and others; (c) the POL Chair
would meet the ShEx CEO periodically; and (d) the Shareholder NED sat on
the POL’s Board, | believe that there was a governance structure in place that

provided an appropriate level of oversight of POL.

Knowledge of relevant issues

31. At the time of joining ShEx, | had no knowledge or understanding of:

31.1. the Horizon system, its integrity or remote access. During my term, | do not

recall this information ever being brought to my attention formally or at a Board

meeting. | have been shown the ShEx Board minutes for March 2012 — July

31.2. complaints made by SPMs as to the integrity of the Horizon IT system. | recall
during one of my bi-annual meetings with Alice Perkins, her mentioning, almost
as a passing comment, that there were a small segment of difficult SPMs and
ongoing difficulties with the union. | have no recollection of her providing any
more detail than that, and so cannot say whether she was referring to Horizon
issues, but as | understood from her, these were simply business as usual
issues. | do not recall any other conversations with Ms Perkins or anyone else

relating to complaints made by SPMs.

31.3. the investigation and prosecution of SPMs for theft, fraud and false accounting.
| do not recall the ShEx Team and/or the Shareholder NED on the POL Board
ever raising the issue of prosecutions to the ShEx Board or to me personally.
Upon reflection, | would have expected the POL Chair to have brought this
matter to my attention during one of our bi-annual meetings, because
conducting prosecutions is such a significant step with such serious
consequences for the SPM being prosecuted; she did not. Knowing now about
this, | consider that criminal prosecutions are such a serious issue that the

ShEx Board should have been aware of this.

31.4. who was responsible for (a) the investigation of those alleged offences; (b) the
decision on whether to prosecute those matters; and (c) the conduct of those
prosecutions. As | have explained at paragraph 31.3 above, | had no

knowledge of prosecutions before or during my term as Chair.

32. Given the passage of time, | cannot recall exactly when (a) | became aware of
those matters referred to in paragraph 31 ; (b) | learned about the Second Sight

report; or (c) | learned that Deloitte had been instructed to undertake a further

Page 14 of 30

review of the Horizon system. During my tenure as Chair I do not recall seeing
the Second Sight report; it was not brought to the attention of the ShEx Board

or otherwise shown to me.

Actual Oversight

33. I have been asked by the Inquiry to consider the following documents:

33.1 the presentation on POL Summary dated February 2012 (UKGI00018222). |
do not recall seeing this document, either at the time or subsequently, prior to
my preparation for this witness statement. | not that this document is dated

prior to my start date as Chair of the ShEx Board;

33.2 the ShEx presentation on POL Quarterly Review dated April 2012
(UKGI00041969); the ShEx presentation on POL Quarterly Review dated
August 2012 (UKGI00001439); the ShEx presentation on POL Quarterly
Review dated September 2012 (UKGI00001444); and the ShEx presentation

on POL Quarterly Review dated June 2013 (UKGI00042011);

33.3. the ShEx presentation on POL Annual Review dated November 2012
(UKGI00042676) and the ShEx presentation on POL Annual Review dated

December 2012 (UKGI00017385); and

33.4 the ShEx review of POL dated April 2012 (UKGI00042607).

34, My recollection is that the above documents were not included in the Board
packs for the ShEx Board. This is supported by the fact the minutes of the
ShEx Board meetings listed in paragraph 31.1 above do not reference these

documents.

35. It is important to remember the context of how many ShEx assets there were

in the portfolio. The ShEx CEO would present the CEO’s report to the ShEx
Board, which would contain the asset-specific issues which were important for
the ShEx Board to be aware of and/or advice. Occasionally | recall that the
ShEx CEO would give more detailed presentations to the ShEx Board on
asset-specific issues. | would not have expected to see quarterly reviews or
annual reviews of the assets as a matter of course, as we would not have
needed to know the level of detail in quarterly reports and annual reports

unless there was a specific issue raised by the ShEx CEO.

36. In addition, | have been referred to the following communications, which | was

not copied to, and do not recall otherwise being drawn to my attention:

36.1. email exchange between Mike Whitehead and Chris Darvill on 9 March 2012

(UKGI00001406);

36.2 summary report on the current status of the Horizon litigation, attachment to

the above document (UKGI00013652);

36.3. email from Martin Humphreys to Mike Whitehead dated 12 March 2012

(UKGI00001407);

36.4 letter from Stephen Hepburn MP to Edward Davey MP dated 24 February 2012,

attachment to the above document (UKGI00001408)

36.5 emails from Mike Whitehead on 22 June 2012 (UKGI00001424);

36.6 brief to Norman Lamb MP for meeting with Alan Bates dated 27 June 2012

(UKGI00001458) and letter from Jo Swinson to Dr John Pugh dated 17

September 2012 (UKGI00001459), attachments to the above document;

request 12/1362: proposed Section 36 exemption regarding Ministerial briefing

(UKG100018248);

37. These documents at paragraph 36 above are within the standard operational
relationship between ShEx, POL, and BIS. As is evident from these documents,
the role of the ShEx Team means that in circumstances where a Minister has
a question, the ShEx Team assists the Minister directly and co-ordinates with
POL to obtain the answers. The ShEx Board is not involved, unless it is a

matter which requires the ShEx Board’s advice or attention. If the issues being

raised by SPMs with Horizon, and the associated Ministerial complaints, had
been flagged as a significant issue by the ShEx Team, | would have expected

to have sight of it.

38. As is evident from these documents, the messaging from POL through the
ShEx Team was that there was not a significant issue, because POL’s view
was that Horizon was robust, and that POL was doing everything it should be
doing to address, including by way of the Second Sight review. Moreover, as
is evident from these documents, the ShEx Team considered this was an

operational issue for POL.

39. I have been asked to consider the minutes of the POL Board meeting on 23
May 2012 (UKGI00019348), and in particular section POLB12/60. | do not
recall seeing this document either at the time or subsequently, prior to my

preparation for this witness statement.

40. I have been asked to consider the minutes of the POL Board meeting on 31
October 2013 (UKGI00019292) and the ShEx presentation on strategy
discussion with ShEx Team dated March 2014 (UKGI00002225). | do not recall
seeing these documents either at the time or subsequently, prior to my
preparation for this witness statement. | note that these documents show that
the number of SPM cases had grown to 150. Whilst POL might have had a
robust view on Horizon, and 150 cases is a small proportion of the total number
of SPMs, and total number of accounting transactions undertaken in Horizon,
it is a big enough number in its own right, that | would have wished this matter
to have been brought to my attention, as the issue was clearly getting bigger

and could get worse.

41. I refer to paragraph 31 above;
41.1 | cannot explain the extent to which ShEx oversaw (i) the conduct of

prosecutions by POL or Royal Mail Group; (ii) ShEx’s oversight of POL’s
investigation and response to allegations made by SPMs concerning the
reliability of the Horizon IT system; or (iii) ShEx’s involvement with POL's
response to the Justice For Subpostmasters Alliance, as the ShEx Board had

no oversight on these matters.

41.2 | cannot explain the extent to which ShEx oversaw (i) the Second Sight
investigation; (ii) the Initial Complaint and Mediation Scheme; or (iii) plans to
amend Second Sight’s terms of engagement. These matters were not raised

to the ShEx Board.

42. Responsibility for matters of sufficient significance that the shareholder’s
involvement was required would have ultimately been the responsibility of the
Secretary of State, assisted by the relevant ShEx Team (as described above).
| have explained above my responsibilities as Chair, but would note here that
the ShEx Board had the power to challenge the ShEx CEO if they were not
performing adequately and could in extremis recommend their removal to the

Secretary of State. | am accountable in that regard as Chair of the ShEx Board.

43. I have considered the ShEx Policy and Management Board Portfolio dated
May 2011 (UKGI00043224). Following POL’s separation from Royal Mail its
status was raised to priority level. POL had been a division of a major asset,
and now it was a major asset in its own right, receiving substantial levels of
funding from the government and so it was wholly appropriate for ShEx to take

a more direct role in its governance.

44. | have considered the ShEx presentation on POL Quarterly Review dated

August 2012 (UKGI00001439). | cannot tell from this document what work by
ShEx is being referred to. It was the role of the ShEx Team to monitor the

progress of POL's plans, as they did for all assets.

45. I have been asked whether the ShEx Board were informed or had knowledge

of the following matters:

45.1 the existence of bugs, errors, or defects in the Horizon IT System;

45.2 the Helen Rose report / Lepton report (POL00022598);

45.3. Second Sight’s Interim Report and/or the content of the same (POL00029650);

45.4 Simon Clarke’s advice of 15 July 2013 and the content of the same

(POL00006357);

45.5 Simon Clarke’s advice of 2 August 2013 and/or the content of the same

(POL00129453);

45.6 —_Linklater’s advice on the Mediation Scheme and/or content of the same

(POL00107317);

45.7 Deloitte’s Project Zebra report and/or the content of the same (POL00028069);

45.8 That Fujitsu could insert data in branch accounts without the consent of

subpostmasters;

45.9 That Fujitsu may be able to, under certain circumstances, delete and replace

Horizon audit files containing transaction data;

45.10 POL’s plans to amend Second Sight’s terms of engagement following July

2013; and

45.11 POL’s plans to amend the Mediation Scheme in 2014.

46. The matters and documents referred to at paragraph 45 above were not raised
with the ShEx Board. What information is passed to the ShEx Board is
dependent on what ShEx Team and the ShEx CEO deem to be an issue that
required the attention or advice of the ShEx Board. It is now clear that the
documents referred to raised serious issues in relation to the functioning of the
Horizon system, and the prosecution and treatment of subpostmasters. | think
that both ShEx and the Board should have been made aware of these very
significant matters. That would not necessarily mean having each of the
documents referred to being provided to the ShEx Board. The important thing
would have been for the issue to be communicated to the ShEx Board, with

the underlying documents available to the ShEx Board on request.

47. For completeness, | should add that | recall a conversation with Richard
Callard in which he referred to Deloitte having been instructed to conduct a
review to give assurance in respect of concerns raised in Parliament. | recall

saying to him that | had experience of Deloitte, and would recommend them.

Resignation

48. In 2014, after my two-year term as Chair of ShEx had been extended by six
months, | resigned from ShEx to concentrate on my other Non-Executive roles
at Old Mutual and Bank of Ireland. There was no connection between my

resignation and any POL-related issues.

General
49. I have been asked to comment if there was anything | would have handled

differently with hindsight, in relation to the oversight of POL. My answer to this
is necessarily limited by the fact that | was unaware of the Horizon/SPM-related
issues referred to. That said, | do have reflections on the following actions |
could have taken which, had I done so, may have helped surface these issues

to the ShEx Board.

50. I believe that it could have been helpful for ShEx Board packs to have a
schedule of significant issues raised in Parliament relating to Government
assets where ShEx handled the shareholder role. Significance could be
defined broadly by reference to the financial implications of the issue, or the
wider public interest. This would provide the ShEx Board with an additional
opportunity to have sight on such issues, as a mitigant to important issues
raised by Ministers not having been brought to the ShEx Board’s attention
through other channels. | would like to have introduced, or at least explored,

this initiative whilst | was Chair of ShEx.

51. In addition, | would like to have raised as a query at ShEx Board level the way
in which ShEx Teams received and challenged information received from
Government assets, as | believe it is now clear that there were deficiencies in
information flow within POL and up to ShEx. This did not occur to me at the
time, and as | have said | was not close to the detail of how ShEx Teams
interacted with Government assets. Nonetheless, | regret having not given

thought to this issue in my role as Chair of ShEx.
