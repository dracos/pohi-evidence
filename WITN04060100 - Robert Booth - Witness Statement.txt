BACKGROUND

1. Please set out a brief professional background.
Educational background

7. | have a degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Surrey.
Sep 84 — Sep 90: CAP > SEMA > Schlumberger SEMA

8. In September 1984, | joined Computer Analysts and Programmers Ltd ("CAP")
as a graduate in the industrial division as a programmer. CAP merged with
Sema-Metra SA in 1988 to form Sema Group plc, which in turn was acquired
by Schlumberger in 2001. By the time | left Schlumberger Sema, | was a Team
Leader in the financial division involved with real time dealing room trading

systems.
Oct 90 - May 03: Post Office

9. In October 1990, | joined Post Office Counters Limited ("POCL") as a Team
Leader for the in-house development of an electronic point of sale system,
ECCO+, which was part of the counter automation of Post Office's directly
managed offices (these are also known as Crown Offices). | led one of the front
office development teams and later moved into a design and business liaison

role.

10. | subsequently moved on to consolidating the disparate email systems in the
Royal Mail Group before joining the already established POCL Private Finance
Initiative ("PFI") team. The PFI team had been set up specifically to handle the
procurement of what became the Horizon System. | did not join at the very

beginning and | cannot recall the exact date | joined the PFI team, but it was

Page 4 of 80
11.

12.

13.

WITNO04060100
WITN04060100

likely to be in 1994 or 1995, on the basis that the tender process for the system
took place in early 1996. | explain my role at this time in detail in response to
question 2 below but | worked on the Horizon project in various roles roughly

through to June 2003 and then again in 2014.

In 2003, | was part of the Post Office team that worked on enabling chip and
PIN cards for payment and banking where the Benefits Agency's Post Office
Card Account product (“POCA”) was treated as a bank. Horizon was the largest
connected retail network in Europe, and leading edge with colour touch
screens, scales, bar code readers and PIN pads. | subsequently worked on the
replacement of the original banking switch (connecting Horizon to the Link
network, Alliance & Leicester Bank and POCA) in use by Post Office at the time

(IBM Connex) to a Fujitsu solution.
Jun 03 - Oct 06: Xansa > Steria (TUPE from Post Office)

In June 2003, | was transferred from Post Office to Xansa (became Steria) and
continued to work primarily on Post Office projects. Whilst at Xansa, | continued
working on the Post Office Horizon chip and PIN project until it was completed,

although | cannot remember the date that project completed.

After the chip and PIN project was completed, | became technical lead for the
development and deployment of the paystation programme. Paystation was a
project with an estate of 12,500 standalone terminals separate from Horizon. It
transacted bill payments, smart card (Quantum gas) and smart key recharging

(Talexus electricity), as well as phone top-ups and debit/credit card payment.

WITN04060100

Nov 06 - Mar 14: Post Office

In November 2006, | resigned from Xansa and re-joined Post Office as an
employee and led the technical strand for a standalone biometric capture
solution, Application Enrolment Identity (“AEI”). This solution was implemented
and deployed servicing UK Border Agency (later to become UK Visas and
Immigration), the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency and the Security
Industry Authority, providing a light touch interface to Horizon to allow for
sharing of the physical peripherals and allowing customers to pay for the

transaction using standard Horizon services.
Apr 14 - Mar 20: Atos (TUPE from Post Office)

In April 2014, | was transferred under TUPE to Atos where | worked on the Post
Office counter hardware refresh evaluation and implementation for both HQ and
branches, including new hardware, new network and porting HNG-X to HNG-
A. This was primarily moving to modern functionally equivalent hardware and
operating system and worked with Computacenter who took over the
management of the counter estate to achieve this. Fujitsu ported the HNG-X
application to a current Java version, HNG-A, that would run on the new
hardware and delivered this into user acceptance having internally tested the

port first.

Following on from ad-hoc consultancy, in 2019 | moved onto my current project
of making the Post Office payment and banking solution compliant with the
current Payment Card Industry ("PCI") standards. A major part of this was
changing the way the PIN pads communicated with the POS and how the

transactions were routed to Link (and thence the banks) and to Global

Payments for credit/debit card and a minor piece of work for handling Travel

Money Cards.
Apr 20 — Present: Post Office TUPE from Atos

17. In April 2020, | was transferred under TUPE from Atos back to Post Office
where | have continued work on the PCI project which has just completed

rollout.
2. Please set out the background to your involvement in the Horizon project.

18. Not having had continuous employment with Post Office, | do not have any day
books relating to that period and with matters going back over twenty years |
am unable to give precise dates and roles and have set out things as best as |
can remember them. | cannot be sure that these are true memories and not
affected by later knowledge or reinterpretation of matters after the event. As
other material comes to light, this may change my recollection but my answers

here are as | remember things.
Background to Horizon

19. For context, Horizon has moved through several evolutions in its life and has
generally been referred to as "Horizon" throughout by branch staff. It has not
materially changed in function (it still records sales, facilitates payment and
delivery of transactions, performs accounting, has user management etc.) but

the underlying technology has changed.

a. Atthe time of the award, Horizon was based on the Riposte product from
Escher which was used for the national rollout and several iterations

thereafter.

Page 7 of 80
WITNO04060100
WITN04060100

b. Horizon then moved to Horizon Next Generation and was labelled
HNG-X as there were discussions that | was not privy to around options
and option “X” was agreed upon. At this time it was also known as
Horizon Online as one of the changes was that every basket was
committed online in real time, rather than updates to the centre occurring
whenever a connection was established which could leave several
baskets waiting to be uploaded to the data centre. HNG-X was a fresh
counter code implementation but used the same hardware, allowing the
migration to be performed with on-site assistance at a peak of circa 300
branches a week. As well as the counter change, the data centre that
interacted with the counters changed in line though back end interfaces
were protected as much as possible to minimise disruption to connected

parties.

c. With the push to adopt Towers models — where there would be several
suppliers potentially competing for work — POL split the Fujitsu single
supplier service into several services. Computacenter delivered new
hardware and a Windows 10 operating environment that they managed
and Fujitsu ported the HNG-X counter to HNG-A which was a modern

Java implementation and accommodated the new hardware and drivers.

Throughout my involvement with Horizon, POCL had contractual relationships
with ICL Pathway, and POCL clients such as Alliance & Leicester and Link.
However, there was no direct contractual relationship between ICL Pathway
and these parties in regard to the work POCL required to interface into Horizon.
ICL Pathway would document their solution at an interface level or high-level
infrastructure level, which BA/POCL and later just POCL (including myself)

Page 8 of 80
21.

22.

WITNO04060100
WITN04060100

would then use to agree with the relevant third party, or the third party would
provide their interface for ICL Pathway to conform to. Sometimes there were

ICL Pathway/third party workshops but always facilitated by POCL.

Once interfaces were agreed and elements of data to be captured were
identified, the revised workflows and other documents would be produced by
Fujitsu and then |, along with colleagues, would review and agree these
specifications. The lower level implementation detail and testing were not
shared and POL would subsequently test at an end user level as part of User
Acceptance Testing that would feed any defects and/or observations back to
be amended or noted at Acceptance meetings as outstanding with mitigations,
where the overall recommendation was passed up to the Release Authorisation

Board for release authorisation.

As in any development lifecycle, there would have been issues found and rated
as "High", "Medium" or "Low". High referred to fundamental problems with the
product, Medium referred to problems with the product that were not fatal and
had an acceptable workaround (but a limit to the number of workarounds that
would be reasonably accommodated was in place) and Low referred to
problems that did not materially affect the operation of the product such as text
alignment (but again there was a limit to the number of Lows to ensure the end
user experience was good). By the time Acceptance occurred, there would be
fewer issues with the product and Acceptance would not be recommended with
any Highs, and only some Mediums would be permitted whilst there would be
a bigger limit on Lows. The Acceptance status was then passed on to the

Release Authorisation Board for a release authorisation verdict.

Involvement with Horizon

My first involvement with Horizon was when | joined the established POCL PFI

team, as explained in response to question 1 above.

When | joined the POCL PFI team, | was initially involved as a junior member
of the technical evaluation team, collating business requirements from analysts
and working with POCL and BA to set out some of the baseline technical

requirements for what was to become Horizon.

| was part of the team which scored the tenders on a predefined matrix, which
was then combined with other strands and led to the award of the Horizon
contract to ICL Pathway. | remember attending meetings with bidders, but not

the specifics as it was a long time ago.

The evaluation and delivery team were, as | recall, in silos with the back office
(e.g. settlement, billing, remuneration) separate from the front office
(transaction capture / interaction with clerk and customer) where | was placed.
There were other strands including security, service management, contracts
and the commercial terms and conditions etc. but | cannot recall the precise

strands or breakdown of responsibilities.

Following the award of the Horizon contract to ICL Pathway, | worked with the
Benefits Agency ("BA") as part of the POCL team in refining the requirements
and implementation to deploy the first generation of Horizon. This was based
on the Escher Riposte product which was in use until circa 2009 when it was
replaced by a Fujitsu written Java application and Oracle based data centre.
The Escher Riposte product was, and still is, a messaging product where a

message is generated at a counter and replicated to partners be they within the

Page 10 of 80
28.

29.

WITNO04060100
WITN04060100

branch or within the data centre. For single position branches there were two
discs in the machine, with the second disc being the partner such that data was
always stored on at least two media. Once data had been replicated to the data
centre, it was available for harvesting and delivery to clients. In terms of
process, requirements set by BA/POCL were set out in a requirement catalogue
and ICL Pathway would then set out acceptance criteria of how they were going
to meet each requirement. BA/POCL would then assess the approach and
these would be agreed; ICL Pathway would then submit evidence in line with

the criteria to allow POCL to asses if the criteria were met.

In respect of Horizon, | was broadly involved in the design of the front-end
magnetic card acceptance and client interface for the Post Office Card Account
("POCA") which was also known as Card Account at Post Office ("CAPO") or
the Benefits Payments Card ("BPC"). This was the front-end transaction
capture for bill payment and banking and payment. This referred to the clerk-
customer interaction for basic bill payment where a customer would present a
token (magnetic card or barcoded bill) along with monies to credit their account.
| also worked on back-end interfaces to the clients to deliver transactions to
them and get authorisation verdicts from them, and fed into the reconciliation
of the counter view and the client view. The back office was responsible for
invoicing (payment for work done by Post Office), settlement (the exchange of
monies tendered by the customer) and remuneration (payment to the branch

for chargeable work that was undertaken).

My main role was as a point of presence at the Fujitsu site in Feltham, being
physically present on site to allow Fujitsu to discuss matters face-to-face which
| could then take back to the relevant experts. Both POCL and BA staff were in

Page 11 of 80
30.

31.

WITNO04060100
WITN04060100

a single room in Feltham, separate to Fujitsu, with no unaccompanied access
to Fujitsu areas. This allowed attendance at document review meetings and
undertaking of reviews of Fujitsu provided documents with other BA and POCL
colleagues. These documents consisted of mainly technical interface
documents but | also provided ad-hoc advice on other types of documents.
Being physically on site, | would have acted as a "document champion" for
POCL; this role was to provide a point of contact for Fujitsu in relation to the
review of documents, but | was not necessarily the subject matter expert. |
would have acted as a single point of contact for Fujitsu and as a conduit to the
relevant subject matter experts, facilitating discussion and collating comments
before sending these comments back to Fujitsu. Whilst they were involved, BA
had the senior presence at Feltham and greater access to ICL Pathway and |
reported into several different managers within the Post Office infrastructure
over the period and recall at least two management consultancies (French

Thornton and PA Consulting) into whom | also reported at one stage or another.

When BA withdrew from Horizon, there was no substantive change in my role
of being a point of contact for Fujitsu and reviewing the Fujitsu documents. The
main difference was that | felt that my views were given more weight as any
concerns | raised would be moderated by Post Office as opposed to BA where

the single BA product outweighed the needs of all the POL products.

My recollection is that the original Horizon rolled out with the payment
mechanism being a bar-coded book. However, in 2003, work began to move
to chip and PIN as the payment mechanism since there was a change coming
in 2005 which moved payment liability to retailers if they did not have a chip
and PIN payment facility. The IBM Connex banking switch in use at the time

Page 12 of 80
32.

33.

WITNO04060100
WITN04060100

would have needed enhancement to support chip and PIN and | think there was
a tender process, but the result was that Fujitsu developed equivalent banking
and payment support to allow card acceptance, including chip and PIN. |
continued my involvement in payment and banking, reviewing technical Fujitsu
documents and liaising with POCL clients: Streamline (for payment, later
retendered and awarded to Global Payments), POCA and Alliance & Leicester
who were directly connected to Horizon, and Link who were directly connected

to Horizon and acted as a switch to access the other POCL banking clients.

| then moved away from Horizon and worked on various other Post Office
initiatives, the main ones being the technical strand lead of a separate
paystation project, after which | was the technical strand lead for the separate

biometric AEI project.

After this gap away from direct Horizon involvement, | would have been called
upon ad-hoc on matters relating to Horizon due to my previous involvement,
though | cannot recall any specific queries. | became involved in the POL
Towers Procurement around 2014. One element of the POL Towers
Procurement, as far as Horizon was concerned, was to replace the aged
counter hardware, necessitating the porting of HNG-X to an updated Java and
Windows 10 environment. There were initially five Towers involved, which
impacted Horizon and broke up the Fujitsu monolith into a multi-vendor
environment where there would be competitive tension between the vendors to
try and achieve a more cost effective and faster solution. This resulted in a
network Tower won by Verizon, an End User Compute hardware ("EUC")
Tower for administration and counter hardware and engineers won by
Computacenter (but now retendered and with DXC), a Front Office Application

Page 13 of 80
34.

35.

WITNO04060100
WITN04060100

Tower won by IBM to replace Horizon (counter, data centre, client connections,
reconciliation i.e. everything that Fujitsu were delivering to POL) but later
cancelled, a data centre Tower that was not awarded and the individual
suppliers maintained their own data centres, and a System Integrator Tower

won by Atos but now expired and reverted back to POL.

| was involved in the EUC Tower and focussed on the replacement of Post
Office branch hardware. To facilitate the move from HNG-X on the old NT4 to
the new Windows 10, the migration approach agreed was to upgrade the
HNG-X Java implementation to a modern Java that would run on Windows 10
("HNG-A"). This would allow the swap of network and hardware in one visit
leaving the clerk with familiar HNG software and it was planned there would be
a later (after approximately three months rolling deployment) upgrade over the
wire to the IBM solution. With the cancellation of IBM counter solution, the HNG-
A solution and infrastructure and processes used by HNG-A have continued to

be used to provide POL's counter service.

Since 2018, | have been involved in the implementation of a solution removing
card data from the HNG-A system to allow POL to gain PCI accreditation. This

project is currently ongoing.

DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT

3. Please consider: FUJ00085352 (WITN 0406R9_1/1); FUJ00003487 (WITN
0406R9_1/2); FUJ00058486 (WITN 0406R9_1/3); FUJ00058484 (WITN

0406R9_1/4); POL00028188 (WITN 0406R9_1/5)

a. Please describe your role in the design and development of the Horizon IT

system.

36. | have reviewed documents WITN 0406R9_1/1, WITN 0406R9_1/2, WITN
0406R9_1/3, WITN 0406R9_ 1/4, WITN 0406R9_1/5 identified in respect of Q3
but have not limited my responses to Q3 in relation to these documents. Please

read this response in conjunction with my response to Q2.

37. Horizon continues to evolve and be developed. My role in the design and
development of Horizon was as part of a team reviewing Fujitsu produced
technical material (e.g. screen designs, process flows, etc.) and liaising with
third parties as required, (as described in paragraph 21 above). It should be
noted that Fujitsu only shared high level designs against the requirements; low
level designs, and code were never shared or made available for review. It
should also be noted that the documents to review could be quite large and
reviews would be restricted to the changes detailed by Fujitsu e.g. the change
history would state "section 3.2 amended" and that would then be reviewed and

the remainder of the document may not have been reviewed.

38. In terms of the design and development, my role was ‘up front’, reviewing the
high-level designs, input to screen flows, agreeing interface specifications etc.

and being available for questions during the testing of the implementation,

Page 15 of 80
39.

40.

WITNO04060100
WITN04060100

which could occur at any point. The implementation was carried out by Fujitsu,

and then by POL testers and followed the structure below.
Development Lifecycle

The lifecycle followed a process where Fujitsu internally undertook Code and
Integration Test (“CIT”) and development, before moving onto System
Validation and Integration (“SV&I") where the code was placed on test rigs
alongside the rest of the system and potentially connected to client test
systems. Fujitsu would typically spend two weeks locating and fixing issues —
as would be expected in a life cycle — before resetting the rig with improved
code and running their tests again, with a third cycle where the code would be

a release candidate.

During SV&I, POL testers had first sight of the screens and reports and feeds
to systems and would be able to highlight anything that was incorrect (e.g. an
interpretation or requirement that needed amending as it did not work, or
addressing text where a previously unidentified error message was required)
and validate the User Acceptance Test (“UAT”) scripts that POL would later
run. POL would run UAT which is very end user and business process
orientated, confirming screens flowed as expected. This phase could not cover
technical tests such as communication failures, for example, where cables
became disconnected, it would not be known if it was before or after a message
was sent so the expected behaviour would not be known and the test would not
be repeatable; only by stopping the code and removing the cable and resuming
code execution could this be tested — a technical intervention that POL were
reliant on Fujitsu for. This phase also did not cover volume or concerted

performance testing (though it would note if the end user experience was slow).
Page 16 of 80
41.

42.

43.

WITNO04060100
WITN04060100

POL depended on Fujitsu's technical lower level testing to address these
conditions. The final phase is Live System Test (“LST”) where Fujitsu would
promote the new code on the LST test rigs to confirm that the migration stages

and internal run books saying what has to happen are correct.

With testing complete, a Release Board would have the evidence presented
along with Fujitsu's recommendation and then would authorise proceeding to
Live if the evidence supported the decision. Live would be firstly in a Model
Office environment, a Live counter just like all the other counters but with no
access to the public. This allowed live connections to be proven, new transitions
to be exercised and to confirm the promotion occurred successfully, before
typically moving to a pilot set of branches for a period. Though testing is
thorough, Live branches will put through more transactions and operate the
system in different ways — not always in accordance with instructions — and the
pilot period allows anomalies to be identified, and if necessary, remedial action

to be taken. The software is then deployed to the estate.
Later involvement with Horizon

After a period without direct involvement in Horizon, | resumed my involvement
in the design and development of Horizon in 2014 as part of the POL Towers

Procurement as described at paragraphs 33 to 34 above.

In relation to Landis & Gyr / Quantum and Talexus, (WITN 0406R9_1/4), | had
previous experience from the paystation implementation of these technologies
and concepts. Though the Quantum product was released, | do not believe that

the Talexus solution was deployed on Horizon.

Page 17 of 80
WITNO04060100
WITN04060100

44. In relation to Data Reconciliation (WITN 0406R9_1/1), | would have been
involved in review and looking at how exceptions would be spotted and if
necessary rectified. This would have looked at matters such as the timing of
arrival of transactions from various feeds and what happened if they arrived out
of sequence and/or did not match etc. i.e. the logical cases that had to be
accommodated and turned into lower level and database and code designs by

Fujitsu which were not shared.

45. In relation to other matters, | am unable to recall the circumstances of the events
and provide any more detail than what is already set out in the documents
identified in relation to Q3. However, | would guess that my involvement with
HAPS was to support John Bruce with the AP files from Horizon to HAPS to AP

clients.

46. In all cases, my involvement with Horizon was at the review of the high-level
designs provided by Fujitsu as implementation specifications and more detailed
material was not shared with me. External interfaces would have been shared
and agreed with the external parties, and would have been checked to ensure
that the high-level design met the requirements. It did not, however, go into the

lower level detail of how Fujitsu would achieve this.

b. What understanding did you have of any technical issues with the ICL

Pathway solution in February to May 1997?

47. | have reviewed documents WITN 0406R9_1/1, WITN 0406R9_1/2, WITN
0406R9_1/3, WITN 0406R9_1/4, WITN 0406R9_1/5 but they do not assist my
recollection in relation to this question. Please read this response in conjunction

with my response to Q2.

Page 18 of 80

48. | do not recall any specific issues or general issues with the ICL Pathway

solution and would not be able to narrow down to specific timeframe if | did.

c. Were you involved in addressing any technical issues between February to

May 1997?

49. | have reviewed documents WITN 0406R9_1/1, WITN 0406R9_1/2, WITN
0406R9_1/3, WITN 0406R9_ 1/4, WITN 0406R9_1/5 but they do not assist my
recollection in relation to this question. Please read this response in conjunction

with my response to Q2.

50. | do not recall any specific issues or general technical issues and would not be

able to narrow down to specific timeframe if | did.
d. What did your role as ‘PDA Acceptance Test Manager’ for ‘APS/HAPS' entail?
51. Please read this response in conjunction with my response to Q2.

52. Horizon had an interface to the Host Automated Payment System ("HAPS"),
which was a mechanism to deliver payments to various end clients. The role of
Programme Design Authority ("PDA") Acceptance Test Manager entailed the
review of ICL Pathway supplied documents where they set out their responses
to Acceptance criteria to demonstrate compliance. It should be noted that | did
not undertake direct testing, nor did | have any test resource that | was
responsible for; my role was limited to document reviews and evaluation of
written responses from ICL Pathway. The responses included satisfying criteria
by Test, where ICL Pathway would state the success of their testing, but could

also include a document review or a simple statement.

e. What concerns did POL have about the reliability and robustness of the

Horizon system between February to May 1997?

53. | have reviewed documents WITN 0406R9_1/1, WITN 0406R9_1/2, WITN
0406R9_1/3, WITN 0406R9_1/4, WITN 0406R9_1/5 but they do not assist my
recollection in relation to this question. Please read this response in conjunction

with my response to Q2.

54. ‘It should be noted that POL had requirements and Fujitsu developed the
solution to meet those requirements, but POL did not see the low-level design,
code or testing. By the time testing was shared there would have been relatively
few bugs, but the point of testing is to uncover bugs so they can be fixed before

the code goes live.

55. My general recollection is limited to the areas | was involved with and looking
back, | cannot recall any specific concerns. As in any development lifecycle, |
expect that there were issues, but if these issues were known prior to release
and not resolved they would have been categorised at Acceptance as
described at paragraph 22 above. If issues were identified in the live phase, |
cannot remember the process that was followed at that time to deal with them.
An issue in the development cycle could range from a disagreement about
whether an acceptance criteria is a test or document review or it could be a

problem identified during testing.

f. How would you describe the relationship between BA/POCL and ICL Pathway

in June 1997?

56. | have reviewed documents WITN 0406R9_1/1, WITN 0406R9_1/2, WITN

0406R9_ 1/3, WITN 0406R9_1/4, WITN 0406RQ9_1/5 but they do not assist my

Page 20 of 80
WITNO04060100
WITN04060100

recollection in relation to this question. Please read this response in conjunction

with my response to Q2 at paragraph 29 above.

57. | do not recall anything specific about the relationship between BA/POCL and
ICL Pathway and my recollection may be limited due to the nature of my
involvement as a junior member of the technical evaluation team at the time
and then being based in Feltham. In general terms, there was a feeling of POCL
being the junior partner with BA having a closer and more senior relationship

with the ICL Pathway.

4. Please consider: FUJ00058252 (WITN 0406R9_1/6); FUJ00000561 (WITN

0406R9_1/7).

a. What did you perceive as the risks to the Pathway Solution from the

introduction of frame relay as preferred to the non-ISDN solution?

58. | have reviewed documents WITN 0406R9_1/6 and WITN 0406R9_1/7
identified in respect of Q4 but have not limited my responses to Q4 in relation

to these documents.

59. _| believe the frame relay technology for connecting all the branches to the data
centre was a proposal that was withdrawn. This seems to be supported by the
documents (WITN 0406R9_ 1/6; WITN 0406R9_1/7); VSAT (a satellite dish with
an Earth Station that the local router plugged into negating the need for any
wired connection to the branch) was used in its place and is still in use, albeit

in a later guise, today.

b. What was your understanding of the issues with network communications

and lack of access around the time of the Horizon rollout?

60. | have reviewed documents WITN 0406R9_1/6 and WITN 0406R9_1/7 but they

do not assist my recollection in relation to this question.

61. Whilst not directly involved with network communications, from memory of
anecdotal information at the time, ISDN was new and not available across the
country, but BA/POCL would provide a volume of lines and diverse enough
coverage to give sufficient impetus to make it viable and cost effective for British

Telecommunications to deploy ISDN at a reasonable, universal, cost.

62. As | was not directly involved in the day to day rollout of Horizon | cannot
comment on any specific issues, and | do not recall any specific issues being

brought to me to assist with, including network communications.

5. Please consider: FUJ00078768 (WITN 0406R9_1/8); FUJ00058397 (WITN

0406R9_1/9); FUJO0078883 (WITN 0406R9_1/10)
a. What did your role as ‘TIP Authority Test Manager’ in July 1998 entail?

63. | have reviewed documents WITN 0406R9_1/8, WITN 0406R9_1/9, and WITN
0406R9_1/10 identified in respect of Q5 but have not limited my responses to
Q5 in relation to these documents. Please read this response in conjunction

with my response to Q2.

64. Whilst | cannot remember what "TIP" stands for, the role of TIP Authority Test
Manager would have entailed the review of ICL Pathway supplied technical
documents and, along with colleagues, providing feedback on those

documents. It should be noted that | did not undertake direct testing, nor have

Page 22 of 80
WITNO04060100
WITN04060100

any test resource that | was responsible for; my role was limited to document

reviews.

b. What technical defects / issues were you aware of as a result of the pilot in

June 1999?

65. | have reviewed documents WITN 0406R9_1/8, WITN 0406R9_1/9, and WITN

0406R9_1/10 but they do not assist my recollection in relation to this question.

66. | am unable to recall being made aware of any technical defects or issues as a
result of the pilot in June 1999. | would only be aware of any technical defects

or issues brought to review meetings.
c. What was the result of the identification of such technical defects / issues?

67. | have reviewed documents WITN 0406R9_1/8, WITN 0406R9_1/9, and WITN
0406R9_1/10 but they do not assist my recollection in relation to this question.
Please read this response in conjunction with my response to Q2 at paragraph

22 above.

68. | am unable to recall the results of the identification of any such technical
defects or issues. In general terms, the approach would be a review of
presented material, categorisation of any issues identified as described in my
response to Q2 and a recommendation on next steps would have been made

for senior management to agree.
d. Did this prompt further testing?

69. | have reviewed documents WITN 0406R9_ 1/8, WITN 0406R9_1/9, and WITN

0406R9_1/10 but they do not assist my recollection in relation to this question.

Please read this response in conjunction with my response to Q2 at paragraph

22 above.

70. 1! am unable to recall if this prompted further testing. In general terms, | would
have expected any issues categorised as High or Medium to have an agreed
set of steps that would lead to the resolution of the problem, normally with an

agreed plan to accompany it.

71. The role of TIP Authority Test Manager would have entailed the review of ICL
Pathway supplied technical documents and, along with colleagues, providing
feedback on those documents. As explained above, it should be noted that |
did not undertake direct testing, nor have any test resource that | was
responsible for; my role was limited to document reviews and the documents

would not have had low level detail in them.
e. What was your role in this between June to November 1999?

72. | have reviewed documents WITN 0406R9_ 1/8, WITN 0406R9_1/9, and WITN

0406R9_1/10 but they do not assist my recollection in relation to this question.
73. | amunable to recall my role in relation to this between June to November 1999.

0406R9_1/14)

a. What involvement did you have in ensuring the security and integrity of the

data in the Horizon System from 1999 to 2004?

74. | have reviewed documents WITN 0406R9_1/11, WITN 0406R9_ 1/12, WITN

0406R9_1/13, WITN 0406R9_1/14 but have not limited my responses to Q6 in

Page 24 of 80

WITN04060100

relation to these documents. Please read this response in conjunction with my

response to Q2.

75. 1 am unable to recall my involvement in ensuring the security and integrity of
the data in Horizon from 1999 to 2004. Looking at the documents, they are not
familiar and | assume | was acting as a gateway into others within Post Office
for more detailed review as | was co-located with ICL Pathway at Feltham.
Though | am aware of general security principles, | am not a security specialist
and would have deferred to specialists such as Sue Lowther (WITN

0406R9_1/14).

b. What processes did you understand were in place for access control and user

administration in 1999?

76. | have reviewed documents WITN 0406R9_ 1/11, WITN 0406R9_1/12, WITN
0406R9_1/13, WITN 0406R9_1/14 but they do not assist my recollection in

relation to this question.

77. | am unable to recall what processes were in place for access control and user
administration in 1999 as this was not my area. In respect of counter login, |
believe there would have been a general approach of branch users having just
enough access to do their jobs, but | cannot recall the detail. In addition, while
| remember the use of a memory card to ensure there was a token as well as a
PIN to start up and then username and password to log on to the counter
system | cannot recall any details of these measures. | would have deferred to

security specialists and collated their feedback.

c. What processes did you understand were in place for access control and user
administration in 2000? Did they change during that year? If so, please

explain why.

78. | have reviewed documents WITN 0406R9_1/11, WITN 0406R9_1/12, WITN
0406R9_1/13, WITN 0406R9_1/14 but they do not assist my recollection in

relation to this question.
79. 1am unable to recall the processes in place at the time and if they did change.
d. What effect did this have on the rollout of the Horizon Programme?

80. | have reviewed documents WITN 0406R9_1/11, WITN 0406R9_1/12, WITN
0406R9_1/13, WITN 0406R9_1/14 but they do not assist my recollection in

relation to this question.

81. | do not know what effect this had on rollout of Horizon as rollout was not my

area and | do not recall being made aware of any issues.

e. What was your understanding of the issues that arose with security / data

integrity within the Horizon system from 1999 to 2004?

82. | have reviewed documents WITN 0406R9_ 1/11, WITN 0406R9_1/12, WITN
0406R9_1/13, WITN 0406R9_1/14 but they do not assist my recollection in

relation to this question.

83. | am unable to recall being made aware of any issues that arose with the

security or data integrity within Horizon from 1999 to 2004.

a. What involvement did you have in the design of the Interface Specifications

for the Horizon system in June/July 1997?

84. | have reviewed documents WITN 0406R9_1/15, WITN 0406R9_1/16, and
WITN 0406R9_ 1/17 but have not limited my responses to Q7 in relation to these

documents. Please read this response in conjunction with my response to Q2.

85. Whilst | am unable to recall anything specific to June/July 1997, in general
terms | would have been a reviewer for the ICL Pathway supplied documents
as well as any documents originating from third parties if they had them (e.g.
Horizon connecting to a standard offering). | would have input to any
deficiencies or ambiguities that | and my colleagues found during our review.
The implementation of our comments would have fallen to ICL Pathway and

would not have been shared with us.

b. Were you aware of any issues or defaults in the design specifications in

June/July 1997?

86. | have reviewed documents WITN 0406R9_1/15, WITN 0406R9_1/16, and
WITN 0406R9_1/17 but they do not assist my recollection in relation to this

question. Please read this response in conjunction with my response to Q2.

87. | am unable to recall any issues or defaults in the design specifications in
June/July 1997. All designs go through iterations up to and during testing and
subsequently if issues arise in live. Without the change history detail, | cannot

extrapolate further but would not be surprised by iterations. However, | would

Page 27 of 80
WITNO04060100
WITN04060100

not have had sight of lower level designs or issues resolved within ICL Pathway

before the designs were shared with BA/POCL.

c. What involvement did you have in the design of the Interface Specifications

during the rollout in early 2000?

88. | have reviewed documents WITN 0406R9_1/15, WITN 0406R9_1/16, and
WITN 0406R9_1/17 but they do not assist my recollection in relation to this

question. Please read this response in conjunction with my response to Q2.

89. | am unable to recall what Interface Specifications were being worked on in
early 2000, but would have reviewed the Interface Specifications along with

colleagues and any third parties if present at that time.

d. FUJ00001670 (WITN 0406R9_1/17): what was your understanding for the
updates to this version of the document which included removing the comment
on "system shortfall" and adding a comment on "liability due to system
shortfall" in section 3.3, at the same time as the document classification

changed to "COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE"?

90. | have reviewed document WITN 0406R9_1/17. | was listed as an “optional
reviewer" on the document and may not have reviewed the document. Whilst
the comments on "system shortfall" and "liability due to system shortfall" appear
to have been removed as set out in the document history section, the section
provides no context to this change and does not assist my recollection in

relation to this question.

91. | am unable to recall the reason behind these changes and whether they had
any bearing on the change in document classification to "COMMERCIAL IN

CONFIDENCE".

8. Please consider: FUJ00079076 (WITN 0406R9_1/18); FUJO0001368 (WITN
0406R9_1/19); FUJ00001379 (WITN 0406R9_1/20); FUJ00001378 (WITN

0406R9_ 1/23)

a. What was your understanding of the ‘OPS / TMS boundary issue'in December

1998?

92. | have reviewed documents WITN 0406R9_1/18, WITN 0406R9_ 1/19, WITN
0406R9_1/20, WITN 0406R9_1/21, WITN 0406R9_1/22 and WITN
0406R9_1/23 but they do not assist my recollection in relation to this question.
Whilst the documents refer to correspondence dated 2 December 1998, this

correspondence is not attached.

93. However, document WITN 0406R9_ 1/24 (FUJ00079077) may clarify the 'OPS

/ TMS boundary issue’. At comment 7, the document states:

94. "...0fthe OPS/TMS boundary issue concerning whether the Service boundary
between OPS and TMS shall be defined as the physical separation between an
outlet and a point in the ICL Pathway Data Centres, or as the programmatic
interface between the APS/BES/OBCS/EPOSS/PCDF counter applications

and the TMS message store."

95. Based on this comment, | believe the issue was one of ambiguity of definition
of what the boundary was — physical or programmatic - between the branch
(OPS data centre) where the branch would interact with the data centre to lodge
transactions and access clients online. | believe the purpose of the definition
was to give the potential for “competitive tension” in that, if there was a defined

interface between the branch and the centre, a third party could use the

Page 29 of 80
WITNO04060100
WITN04060100

interface and it would allow another supplier to bid for work in conjunction with
or in competition with ICL Pathway. This was never taken forwards and the

challenges to implement this would have been immense.

b. What involvement did you have in the design of the OPS / TMS design

specifications in February to May 2000?
96. Please read this response in conjunction with my response to Q2.

97. Myrole in the design of the OPS / TMS design specifications would have been
as a reviewer of the ICL Pathway documents as they were the author and

supplier of the specifications.

c. Were you aware of any issues or defaults in the design specifications in

February to May 2000? Please explain your answer.

98. | have reviewed documents WITN 0406R9_1/18, WITN 0406R9_ 1/19, WITN
0406R9_1/20, WITN 0406R9_1/21, WITN 0406R9_1/22 and WITN
0406R9_1/23. Whilst the documents specify the usage of the design
specifications, these specifications were never passed on to a third party and

exercised so | cannot comment on their accuracy and completeness.

99. | am unable to recall any issues or defaults in the design specifications in
February to May 2000. These would only have come to light if the documents
had been passed to a third party with a specific task to actively engage with
Fujitsu to interface with OPS / TMS. These were very much a place holder
should POL take that step and would have involved far more detailed
engagement dependent on the third party and what was being integrated. This
was never taken forwards and the challenges to implement this would have

been immense.

d. In your view, were the issues with the OPS / TMS overcome? Please explain

your answer.
100. Please read this response in conjunction with my response to Q8a.

101. | believe the issue referred to here was one of terminology and that it was

resolved as programmatic rather than a physical boundary.

9. Please consider: FUJ00001444 (WITN 0406R9_1/25); FUJ00001677 (WITN
0406R9_1/26); FUJ00001818 (WITN 0406R9_1/27); FUJ00001756 (WITN

0406R9_1/28)

a. What involvement did you have in the development of counter hardware and

software design specifications in 2000?

102. | have reviewed documents WITN 0406R9_1/25, WITN 0406R9_1/26, WITN
0406R9_1/27, and WITN 0406R9_1/28 but have not limited my responses to
Q9 in relation to these documents. Please read this response in conjunction

with my response to Q2.

103. Whilst | cannot be certain of the time period, based on the above documents |
would have reviewed the hardware configurations and highlighted any gaps that
| spotted and ensured an element of future proofing. For instance, | would have
ensured that the PIN Entry Device also had a smart card reader and that

additional communication ports for peripherals were included.

104. | was not involved in usability of the hardware in relation to repetitive stress
injury etc. as POL engaged specialist ergonomists such as Robin Ellis of RED

Design Ergonomics to assess usability and liaised with them.

Page 31 of 80
WITNO04060100
WITN04060100

105. In terms of overall process, a workflow would have been agreed via the
business analysts with the product owners and married to any technical
constraints to arrive at a signed off solution from ICL Pathway. In this context,
a workflow refers to a series of steps a customer and clerk would need to take

with the system to successfully complete a transaction.

b. What was your understanding of how faults were reported to the Horizon

System Helpdesk in 2000?

106. | have reviewed documents WITN 0406R9_1/25, WITN 0406R9_1/26, WITN
0406R9_1/27, and WITN 0406R9_1/28 but they do not assist my recollection
in relation to this question as the Horizon System Helpdesk was not within my

strand.

107. However, in general terms, | believe that then, as now, the branch calls the
helpdesk to raise a ticket with any hardware or software faults or concerns but

these processes were not my area.

c. What involvement did you have in the development of counter hardware and

software design specifications in 2002 and 2003?

108. Whilst | am unable to recall details specific to 2002 and 2003, | would have had
a similar involvement in the development of counter hardware and software

design specifications as | have set out in Q9a.

d. What was your understanding of the training and/or advice that
Subpostmasters / mistresses received on the various designs and updates to

the counter screens between 2000 and 2003?

109. | believe Training was a separate strand from the POCL Infrastructure strand |

was involved with. Normal practice is for the design documents and test output

Page 32 of 80
WITNO04060100
WITN04060100

(screen shots, sample reports) to be used to construct user guides and training
material, but | cannot recall if this was the case between 2000 and 2003.
Training is also another consideration for release authorisation but | cannot
recall whether this would have been a relevant consideration during this time

period.

10. Please consider: FUJ00000603 (WITN 0406R9_1/29); FUJ00001681 (WITN
0406R9_1/30); FUJ00001684 (WITN 0406R9_1/31); FUJ00001702 (WITN

0406R9_ 1/32); FUJO0001742 (WITN 0406R9_1/33).

a. Please describe your involvement in the design of the Horizon IT system once

it was rolled out.

110. | have reviewed documents WITN 0406R9_1/29, WITN 0406R9_ 1/30, WITN
0406R9_1/31, WITN 0406R9_1/32, and WITN 0406R9_1/33 but have not
limited my responses to Q10 in relation to these documents. Please read this

response in conjunction with my response to Q2.

111. Once Horizon was rolled out, | would have moved on to the next initiative and
been involved in changes to introduce new functions or amend existing
functions as part of a business sponsored or Fujitsu change control and
reviewing any deferred items (if there were any), collating requirements,

reviewing Fujitsu responses and liaising with third parties as required.

b. What understanding did you have of any technical issues during the autumn

/ winter of 2002?

112. | have reviewed documents WITN 0406R9_ 1/29, WITN 0406R9_1/30, WITN
0406R9_ 1/31, WITN 0406R9_1/32, and WITN 0406R9_1/33. The documents

show the inclusion of a beep, a change to retention period and general

documentation of the system but they do not assist my recollection in relation

to this question.
113. 1 do not recall any specific technical issues during the autumn / winter of 2002.
11. Please consider: FUJ00001753 (WITN 0406R9_1/34)

a, What was your involvement in the rollout of EPOSS at Post Office Counters

in 2003?

114. | have reviewed document WITN 0406R9_1/34. WITN 0406R9_1/34 is a
processes and procedures document that does not appear to contain any
information relating to the rollout of EPOSS and does not assist my recollection
in relation to this question.

115. | cannot recall being actively involved in the rollout of EPOSS in 2003. As | have
set out in Q2, during 2003 work was starting with the capability to introduce chip

and PIN and that would have been my focus.
b. Were you aware of any testing of EPOSS before it was rolled out?

116. 1 have reviewed document WITN 0406R9_1/34 but it does not assist my

recollection in relation to this question.

117. 1|donothave any reference documents as to what changed or what was tested
and released in this period. However, | assume that the normal development
lifecycle of test reports into acceptance and gating were performed as | have

described in Q2.
c. What technical issues / defects arose during the testing phase?

118. | have reviewed document WITN 0406R9_1/34 but it does not assist my

recollection in relation to this question.

rollout.

e. How prepared were the Subpostmasters / mistresses for the rollout? Please
explain your answer.

122. | have reviewed document WITN 0406R9_1/34 but it does not assist my

recollection in relation to this question.

123. | am unable to recall what changes occurred at this time nor the degree of
communication that would have occurred as the actual rollout was outside the

scope of my area.

a. What role did you play in the contract extension for Horizon in autumn 2003?

124. | have reviewed documents WITN 0406R9_1/35, WITN 0406R9_1/36, and
WITN 0406R9_1/37 but have not limited my responses to Q12 in relation to

these documents.

125. | do not remember any explicit work at this time in relation to the Horizon
contract extension but may well have been involved. Looking at the documents,

| would have supplied input to the lead POL architect (probably Torstein

Page 35 of 80
WITNO04060100
WITN04060100

Godeseth at that time) as and when requested, reviewing Fujitsu statements of
actual volumes to "right-size" the Horizon system going forwards. Right-sizing
a system refers to looking at actual business workload volumes and adjusting
the technical capacity of a system to meet this demand. Where technical
capacity exceeded demand, right-sizing could also involve considering the
potential for any cost savings. The documents together with the question
suggests a contract extension took place, but | cannot recall the term of the
contract and whether autumn 2003 would have been when work on an

extension was undertaken.

b. What role did you play in the process of managing capacity and business
workload volumes that the Horizon system would support under a contract

extension?

126. Whilst | am unable to recall playing a specific role in the context of a Horizon
contract extension, in general terms | would have critiqued workload figures and
projections produced by Fujitsu to ensure things such as Christmas peaks were

included.

| have reviewed documents WITN 0406R9_ 1/38, WITN 0406R9_ 1/24, WITN
0406R9_ 1/39, WITN 0406R9_ 1/40, WITN 0406R9_ 1/41, WITN 0406R9_ 1/42,
WITN 0406R9_1/43, WITN 0406R9_1/44, WITN 0406R9_1/45, WITN

WITN 0406R9_1/50, and WITN 0406R9_1/51 but have not limited my

responses to Q13 in relation to these documents.

As part of the POL technical evaluation team (reporting to Jeremy Folkes (POL
Senior Technical Lead) and then Torstein Godeseth (POL Technical Lead)), |
would have reviewed ICL Pathway's proposed acceptance criteria and
suggested amendments or additional coverage where any gaps or ambiguity
was identified, or where a criterion could be better met (more fully, or with less

effort) elsewhere to optimise the process without diminishing the quality of the

Page 37 of 80
WITNO04060100
WITN04060100

outcome. Once these acceptance criteria were established and agreed by all
parties, | would have been part of the review panel to ascertain if criteria had

been met and then to help produce and collate a recommendation.

129. As the documents show, WITN 0406R9_1/47, WITN 0406R9_1/24, WITN
0406R9_1/40, WITN 0406R9_1/41 WITN 0406R9_1/39, WITN 0406R9_ 1/38,
WITN 0406R9_1/42, WITN 0406R9_1/43, WITN 0406R9_1/48, WITN
0406R9_1/45, WITN 0406R9_1/51, WITN 0406R9_1/50, WITN 0406R9_ 1/46,
WITN 0406R9_1/49 some acceptance incidents were raised (i.e. reflecting that
certain failures had occurred) and rectified and amended which is what testing
and acceptance are about and to be expected with seniors agreeing the

position (WITN 0406R9_ 1/45, WITN 0406R9_ 1/51).

b. What understanding and/or knowledge did you have of the results of any

software testing prior to Acceptance?

130. | have reviewed documents WITN 0406R9_1/38, WITN 0406R9_ 1/24, WITN
0406R9_ 1/39, WITN 0406R9_1/40, WITN 0406R9_1/41, WITN 0406R9_ 1/42,
WITN 0406R9_1/43, WITN 0406R9_1/44, WITN 0406R9_1/45, WITN
0406R9_ 1/46, WITN 0406R9_ 1/47, WITN 0406R9_1/48, WITN 0406R9_ 1/49,
WITN 0406R9_1/50, and WITN 0406R9_1/51 but these documents do not

assist my recollection in relation to this question.

131. 1am unable to recall the results of any software testing prior to Acceptance. In
general terms, | would have deferred to the Test team specialists to give input
on the suitability of releases. However, based on my experience, | do not
believe that ICL Pathway would have presented an Acceptance pack that they

did not believe would get a significant number of items signed off. Prior to

Page 38 of 80
WITNO04060100
WITN04060100

Acceptance, the development lifecycle (as described more fully at paragraph
39 above) would have seen the code move through CIT, SV&l and possibly
UAT and LST, and Acceptance would have addressed criteria in batches as
and when evidence was available. A test pack may have been incomplete (i.e.
missing criteria would not be tabled for acceptance) but would have been

incremental to allow progress to be made in manageable batches.

132. It should also be noted that ICL Pathway development was behind closed
doors, and only outstanding defects that were present would be declared to

POCL when it began its User Testing.

c. Were there external pressures to accept the Horizon System? If so, from

whom?

133. There is always a desire to complete a project and to avoid working on it past
the point of diminishing returns. For instance, whilst Acceptance would not be
recommended with any issues graded "High", a certain number of "Lows" would
be permitted as part of the development lifecycle described at Q2 above.
However, | do not recall any shortcuts being requested, and the acceptance
criteria would have required entries against them showing how they had been

satisfied and if not, why they had not been met.

134. It is worth noting that ICL Pathway did draw boundaries that were not to be
crossed in terms of access to lower level designs and correlation of unit/system

tests to design to confirm all paths had been considered and tested.

d. What understanding did you have of any technical difficulties / issues

between June to September 1999?

135. | have reviewed documents WITN 0406R9_1/38, WITN 0406R9_ 1/24, WITN
0406R9_ 1/39, WITN 0406R9_1/40, WITN 0406R9_ 1/41, WITN 0406R9_ 1/42,
WITN 0406R9_1/43, WITN 0406R9_1/44, WITN 0406R9_1/45, WITN
0406R9_ 1/46, WITN 0406R9_ 1/47, WITN 0406R9_1/48, WITN 0406R9_ 1/49,
WITN 0406R9_1/50, and WITN 0406R9_1/51. Even with the documents |
cannot recall any understanding that | had at the time and | can only comment

on how | would now interpret the issues raised in these documents.

136. WITN 0406R9_1/51 is a management note that | was not copied on and would
not have seen at the time, but provides a high level summary of the outstanding
issues with the system. The issues included data not being harvested correctly
and machines being rebooted due to lock-ups. | do not know how many
branches would have been live at this time. Though mentioned in the note, | am
unsure of what meetings and discussions | was involved in as the distribution

list was of managers one, two or three levels up from myself.

137. WITN 0406R9_1/48 suggests these issues occurred in Live Trial with 299
outlets. This means the issues occurred pre rollout and in a ‘controlled’ but real-
life environment to tease out issues in the new IT system. Reviewing the
documents in that light, the presence of bugs is not welcome, but it justifies the
Live Trial approach where testing prior to a Live Trial would only reveal so
much. When a release is tested the testers would follow the scripts to exercise
the code and attempt to break the system by abandoning half way through and
so on. However, a Live Trial exposes the system to real end users who may not

have read the training material and interpret and follow paths that had not been
Page 40 of 80
WITNO04060100
WITN04060100

considered. There would also be higher concurrent volumes and a wider set of
customer bar codes, magnetic cards and behaviours, which would potentially

expose defects not found in test.

e. What understanding did you have of software defects such as incomplete
transactions receipts, payment mismatches and duplicate transactions between

June to September 1999?

138. | have reviewed documents WITN 0406R9_1/38, WITN 0406R9_ 1/24, WITN
0406R9_1/39, WITN 0406R9_ 1/40, WITN 0406R9_1/41, WITN 0406R9_ 1/42,

WITN 0406R9_1/50, and WITN 0406R9_1/51. Even with the documents |
cannot recall any understanding that | had at the time and | can only comment

on how | would now interpret the issues raised in these documents.

139. 1am unable to recall details of any software defects and only in reading the
referenced documents do | see that there were these issues. Even with the
documents | cannot recall any understanding that | had at the time and
comment would be based on my current interpretation of the documents rather

than recollection at the time.

140. f. What concerns did POL have about the reliability and robustness of the

Horizon system between June to September 1999?

141. | have reviewed documents WITN 0406R9_1/38, WITN 0406R9_1/24, WITN
0406R9_ 1/39, WITN 0406R9_1/40, WITN 0406R9_1/41, WITN 0406R9_ 1/42,

WITN 0406R9_1/50, and WITN 0406R9_1/51.

142. 1 do not know what POL’s view about the reliability and robustness of Horizon
between June to September 1999 was. As a large organisation, | would not
expect POL to have a singular view on any given issue. From the supplied
documents, | can only interpret that the Live Trial surfaced items that needed

resolution prior to rollout.

g. Please consider: FUJ00079154 (WITN 0406R9_1/52); FUJ00079158 (WITN
0406R9_1/53); POL00028364 (WITN 0406R9_1/54); POL00028360 (WITN
0406R9_1/55). What role did you play in the Acceptance Incident Resolution

Workshops in summer 1999?

143. | have reviewed documents WITN 0406R9_1/52, WITN 0406R9_1/53, WITN
0406R9_1/54 and WITN 0406R9_ 1/55 but they do not assist my recollection in

relation to this question.

144. | am unable to recall any Acceptance Incident Resolution Workshops, and if |
did would not be able to confine the workshop to a summer 1999 time period.
In general terms, my involvement would have been to critique ICL Pathway's
responses to incidents and ensure the incidents were resolved to Post Office's
(myself included) satisfaction. | would have had support from senior Post Office
architects (Jeremy Folkes or Torstein Godeseth) in the technical evaluation
team and other Post Office colleagues in the acceptance space (e.g. Tony

Houghton (POL Acceptance)).

WITN04060100

145. Whilst | do not remember this, reading the documents ‘cold’ shows that | was
assigned incident AlI372 to manage which refers to an upgrade activity that

failed to upgrade all of the offices targeted.

146. The memo that is shown as being written by me, WITN 0406R9_ 1/53, has light
italic comments which | assume are ICL Pathway internal comments that were

not shared with me at the time, and | do not know who made them.

h. FUJ00079154 (WITN 0406R9_1/52): what did you understand by POL's
"ongoing concerns" with the transaction data following the test condition being

met in July 1999?

147. | have reviewed document WITN 0406R9_1/52. | am unable to recall what
POL's “ongoing concerns” related to and whether | was made privy to these

concerns.

i. What did you understand were the issues with system management in summer

1999?

148. | have reviewed documents WITN 0406R9_1/38, WITN 0406R9_1/24, WITN

(POL00028364) but they do not assist my recollection in relation to this

question.

149. 1am unable to recall any issues with system management in summer 1999 and

can only infer what these issues might be from the supplied documents. It would

Page 43 of 80

WITN04060100

appear that not all outlets were updated and judgement calls were made by ICL
Pathway during the upgrade process, though there may have been involvement
from other POCL staff (Rod Stocker is mentioned in the documents). | do not

appear to have been involved with these decisions.

j. In summer 1999, did POL have confidence in the robustness/reliability of

Fujitsu's ability to provide the Horizon system?

150. | have reviewed documents WITN 0406R9_1/38, WITN 0406R9_1/24, WITN
0406R9_1/39, WITN 0406R9_ 1/40, WITN 0406R9_1/41, WITN 0406R9_ 1/42,

(POL00028364) but they do not assist my recollection in relation to this

question.

151. | am unable to recall anything about POL's confidence in the
robustness/reliability of Fujitsu's ability to provide Horizon in summer 1999. |
can only interpret the supplied documents and cannot speak for the wider POL
business. From the documents supplied, POCL were aware of several items
that did not work as expected and were managing the risks they were aware of,
seeking answers from ICL Pathway on why things did not go as expected and

assurances that lessons had been learnt and problems identified.

k. What was your understanding of other technical defects / issues at this stage

following the pilot programme?

152. | have reviewed documents WITN 0406R9_ 1/38, WITN 0406R9_ 1/24, WITN

(POL00028364) but they do not assist my recollection in relation to this

question.

153. |am unable to recall any other technical defects or issues at this stage following
the pilot programme. | can only comment on the documents that | have now
been referred to, with the risk of hindsight rather than being able to answer

about my understanding at that stage.

1. Were you aware of any of the following issues in summer 1999: with counter
systems being subject to lockups; screen freezes requiring re-boots; receipts

not matching payments and reference data issues?

154. | have reviewed documents WITN 0406R9_1/38, WITN 0406R9_ 1/24, WITN

WITN04060100

(POL00028364) but they do not assist my recollection in relation to this

question.

155. Whilst | am unclear on timeframe, | do recall that a policy of rebooting the
counter each night was instigated due to an issue that, if the counter was left
up for an extended period (1 cannot recall how long) it could freeze or result in
a blue-screen. | am unable to remember whether the cause of this problem was
a memory leak (a program reserving memory but then not releasing it once
finished) or something else. The nightly reboot seemed to clear the problem

and reduced or eliminated its incidence.

156. It is important to note that 23 years ago NT4 was not as stable as modern
Windows machines and therefore a degree of "blue screen of death" (also

known as "BSOD") errors were expected in systems of that era.
157. 1am unable to recall any issues with receipts or reference data.

m. To what extent did time pressures prevent further testing before the end of

1999?

158. | have reviewed documents WITN 0406R9_1/38, WITN 0406R9_1/24, WITN

question.

Page 46 of 80

WITN04060100

159. 1am unable to recall whether or to what extent time pressures prevented further
testing before the end of 1999. However, | doubt if there was a known issue
that had significant risk of occurring things would have proceeded as the effort
to correct the issue and reputational damage would have hampered user

acceptance of the system and made deployment more difficult in the future.

14. Please consider: FUJ00078754 (WITN 0406R9_1/56); FUJ00079086 (WITN

a. What role did you play in the Acceptance Incidents process in early 2000?

160. | have reviewed documents WITN 0406R9_1/56, WITN 0406R9_ 1/57, WITN
0406R9_1/58, WITN 0406R9_1/59, WITN 0406R9_1/60 and WITN

definitively or confine my answer to early 2000. In general terms, my
involvement would have been to critique ICL Pathway's responses to incidents
and ensure the incidents were resolved to Post Office's (myself included)
satisfaction. | would have had support from senior Post Office architects
(Jeremy Folkes or Torstein Godeseth) in the technical evaluation team and

other Post Office colleagues in the acceptance space (e.g. Tony Houghton).
b. To what extent did POL satisfy itself that the Acceptance Criterion had been

met before proceeding with Acceptance?

162. BA/POCL would have required responses to all the acceptance criteria and

accepted the answers as sufficient or, flagged as risks those that were not

Passed with rectification actions to move them to a Pass state, which may have
included deferral (i.e. criterion was not required at that stage) where agreed by

all parties.

c. What did your role covering the POCL programme management in August

2000 entail?

163. | have reviewed documents WITN 0406R9_1/56, WITN 0406R9_1/57, WITN

164. | am unable to recall my role covering the POCL programme manager Mike
Woolley in August 2000 in any detail. In general terms, my role would likely
have involved attending meetings, writing up outcomes and holding decisions
where possible, giving steers and escalating any decisions that | would not

normally have made that had to be made.
d. What understanding did you have of any defects / issues in 2000?

165. | have reviewed documents WITN 0406R9_1/56, WITN 0406R9_1/57, WITN

166. As in any development lifecycle, | expect that there were issues and some of
these are documented in the referenced material. However, | am unable to
recall any specific defects or issues and would not be able to confine them to

the specified time period even if | did.

core Fujitsu services when they arose? Please explain your answer.
171. \have reviewed documents WITN 0406R9_1/62 and WITN 0406R9_ 1/63.

172. The Framework set out an approach and was used by the Business Continuity
team who were the leads and end customer for this. My input was more on
technical accuracy as it related to POCL's business. As | did not use the

Framework, | cannot comment on its efficacy.

0406R9_1/89. Please read this response in conjunction with my response to

Q2.

176. | am unable to recall the role | played in the design and development of the
software required for the rollout of the Network Banking Services in detail nor
am | able to break down my involvement into specific time periods. | believe |
worked with a colleague, Jason Crellin, who led on the IBM migration, whilst |
focussed on the chip introduction. However, broadly speaking, my involvement
would have been during the transition from the IBM Connex banking switch to
a Fujitsu solution which supported chip and PIN payments around 2003. Around
this time, | would also have been involved in the selection of the PIN Entry

Device to be used.

177. As POL had the contractual relationship with IBM and POL clients such as
POCA, Alliance & Leicester, Link and Streamline, when Fujitsu took over the
banking switch, POL, myself included, would have facilitated any meetings
between these parties. However, | would have handed off to the POL testing
function any liaison with Link and Streamline regarding their testing, as Horizon
was, ‘just another connection’ to them and Streamline and Link used their

Page 51 of 80
WITNO04060100
WITN04060100

standard take on and acceptance approach with POL. | would have liaised more
with Alliance & Leicester and EDS Citibank (later JP Morgan) in respect of
POCA/CAPO and the technical interface between the parties as these were

one-off connections between the bank and Horizon.

178. Fujitsu would have had requirements and responded with solutions. | would
have been involved in formulating the requirements with business analysts and
the business itself and reviewing Fujitsu's responses for completeness and

reuse.

179. The banking design approach agreed upon for the rollout of the Network
Banking Services was to use the Link model. Link are a switch allowing Horizon
to connect to tens of different banks and each bank has a standard interface to
Link. This interface was mimicked by Horizon so that Alliance & Leicester and
POCA saw Horizon as another Link type interface — simplifying their integration
and, as Horizon connected out to Link, it also simplified the design and

implementation for Horizon.

180. The payment sector change of retailer liability on 18 January 2005 drove
adoption of chip and PIN by POL and it was decided to do banking at the same
time to harmonise the counter experience and counter changes. The IBM
Connex changes were significant and a decision to move to a Fujitsu solution

was made.

181. Bespoke extensions for POCA were made from the adoption of banking card
use instead of bar codes, the most notable being a new transaction type to
allow a customer to withdraw up to a daily limit whatever was in their account

to mimic the emptying of a Green Giro. Customers on benefit who needed their

Page 52 of 80
WITNO04060100
WITN04060100

entire benefit — a large percentage — would otherwise have had to do a balance
enquiry and then ask for the balance as two transactions, increasing time, cost,

errors and also disclosing to those around them how much they were taking.

182. As the development was for real time authorisations, | believe ePay (initially for
mobile phone top ups) was developed at the same time and Fujitsu decided to

share some platforms when they came to implement and reconcile.

183. Each banking connection had its own Interface Specification (Alliance &
Leicester were not privy to the POCA solution and vice versa etc.) even though,

from a Fujitsu perspective there was a large amount of repetition.

184. The goal was to reuse to minimise development and support costs and reduce

time to market.

b. What did your role as ‘Solutions Architect’ for POL entail during the design

and rollout phase?

185. As a Solutions Architect for POL, | reviewed the design and connection
approaches proposed by IBM for the banking switch (and later Fujitsu’s
replacement of the IBM switch when chip & PIN was introduced) and the
relevant POL client and fed into the acceptance criteria and acceptance from a
technical perspective, agreeing specific acceptance criteria and the acceptance
method and evaluating the evidence submitted by Fujitsu. This would not have
been at the low level or code review but would have had the medium level of
say interconnections between Fujitsu and POCA, agreeing the number of
processor interfaces and how they were cycled through for availability and
resilience. | would also have been involved in the migration plan, to assure that

the risks being put forward by Fujitsu were understood by senior release board

Page 53 of 80
WITNO04060100
WITN04060100

members. Whilst | would have been involved in any live issues that arose, |

cannot recall any specific issues and the outcome of any resultant meetings.

186. Part of my remit would have been to ensure that a reusable solution and an
industry standard approach was being used to ease the introduction and
replacement of clients at a future date. For example, this could be where there
was a retender for a Merchant Acquirer for payment or to introduce another

directly connected bank.

187. | was also involved in the PIN pad selection and customisation, in consultation
with ergonomists and the business to get a device that could support PIN entry,

and also have future capability.

c. What knowledge and/or understanding did you have of any testing that was

conducted prior to the rollout of Network Banking Services?

188. As | recall, Link and Streamline accreditation testing was undertaken by the
POCL test team to gain sign off from those parties in the same way as other
major new connections would be signed off by them. The purpose of this testing
was to ensure compatibility between Horizon and Link or Streamline
respectively. | believe there was also sign off from Alliance & Leicester for their
connection and POCA for theirs but | do not have any reference documents to

confirm this.

189. Prior to the accreditation testing, | believe Fujitsu conducted their own tests with
a simulator product and before rollout there would have been POL User

Acceptance Testing.

190. 1! would expect that all these tests would have fed into a gating process but |

have no reference documents to confirm or evidence this.

robustness of Horizon and cannot speak for the wider POL business. The move
of the banking engine from IBM to Fujitsu (as described in my response to Q2
at paragraph 31) would seem to indicate high level confidence at giving new
additional and significant work to Fujitsu. Following standard practice, any
incident or risk that was identified would have been managed; it would be
accepted (unlikely to occur or small impact), had a plan to resolve, had an
agreed workaround, or been a show stopper and had to be fixed before release

would be permitted.

Q2.

204. | reported to David Gray (possibly Clive Reed at one stage) as part of the Post
Office Design Authority, with my area of interest being the banking and payment
area. During this period, | moved away from Horizon to other Post Office

projects but would have been contacted ad-hoc for input on ‘random’ areas.

205. Reviewing the referenced documents, it would appear that “PIN change” and
“CAPO Withdrawal Correction” were introduced, the latter being introduced to
correct a misunderstanding at the counter where the customer withdraws the

wrong amount and wants to correct it — it was not a bug that needed correction.

206. There was also an update to the Link interface versions in this period which |
do not remember nor any of the other small changes cited in the version history

of these documents.

b. What did your role as ‘Solutions Architect’ for POL entail once Network

Banking Services were installed at Post Office Counters?

207. When the banking service was deployed, | moved onto a different work strand

of paystation which was separate from Horizon.

defects or bugs in the Network Banking Services from 2005 to 2010?

209. !am unable to recall being made aware of any technical issues, defects or bugs
in the Network Banking Services from 2005 to 2010. However, the documents
| have been referred to show there were some issues during this period, and |
may have been involved in an ad-hoc manner whilst working in other areas due

to my background involvement.

d. What concerns did POL have about the reliability and robustness of the

Horizon system from 2005 to 2010?

210. | have reviewed documents WITN 0406R9_1/90, WITN 0406R9_1/91, WITN
0406R9_ 1/92, WITN 0406R9_ 1/93, WITN 0406R9_ 1/94, WITN 0406R9_1/95,

0406R9_1/102, WITN 0406R9_1/103, WITN 0406R9_1/104 and WITN
0406R9_1/105 but these documents do not assist my recollection in relation to

this question.

211. !amunable to recall any specific concerns and cannot speak for the wider POL
business. However, in this period there was a major change of the system from
the Escher Riposte product to HNG-X which included a Java counter and

Oracle centre which | believe was based on commercial considerations.

18. Please consider: POL00031810 (WITN 0406R9_ 1/106).

a. What understanding / knowledge did you have of Pathway bugs in spring

2002?

212. |have reviewed WITN 0406R9_ 1/106. Whilst the document was copied to me,
| do not recall any positive action from myself and the document does not assist

my recollection in relation to this question.

213. 1 do not recall any specific or general Pathway bugs and would not be able to

place any bugs | recalled to a specific time period.

b. To what extent did you believe that Fujitsu were taking these bugs seriously

enough?

214. | have reviewed WITN 0406R9_1/106 but the document does not assist my

recollection in relation to this question.

215. |am unable to recall bugs that were around at the time and the action taken in
regard to them so | am unable to comment. From reading the cited document,
it would appear there was an issue and the discussion centred more on whether
it was a bug for Fujitsu to fix (their cost) or a change for POL to sponsor and
pay for.

19. Are there any other matters that you consider will assist the Chair?

216. | note that whilst some of the documents contain my name, the context in which
my name arose were actions items for people to ask me to do something, or
where | was being cited as a source. | was not present for or privy to some of

these documents before receiving them from the Inquiry as part of this Witness

Statement submission.

Page 62 of 80
WITNO04060100
WITN04060100

217. It should be noted that Fujitsu were the authors and providers of material and
owned (and still own) the ultimate decision in design and implementation. POL

was and is only able to review material submitted to it in good faith.

218. Finally, as mentioned earlier, these matters have occurred over 20 years ago
in some cases. With no day books or additional reference material, some of my
responses may be inaccurate and contain a degree of blurring as to what
happened when and whether things did happen or not. My responses do reflect
what | can recall to the best of my ability but my recollection may be influenced
due to the passage of time and on reading the referenced documents 20 years

on.
