Appeals Managers

Hi

Iam completing the planning for the Appeals Panel Refresher Training on Monday 26th November at 11:00 am

in Room 506, Old Street. Firstly, please find attached a zip file containing a number of documents:

- agenda for the meeting

- Subpostmasters Appeals Panel Process — A revised document. Please familiarise yourself with this

- Media encryption instruction — we will go over this at the event
- ACC 0112(c) — please review — we will go over this at the event

- Case summary — an example of the latest version.

Secondly, one of the ways of learning will be to review together recent cases you have completed. Please would
you select a case and come prepared to present, share and discuss it. Nothing too formal is required — just
enough so the group can understand the issues. I would be grateful if you would let me know which case it will
be, so we can try to be sure the we have cases which cover main leamming topics. (Gary and Kevin — I will send

you case studies in a separate email).

Thanks - I look forward to seeing you on 26th.
