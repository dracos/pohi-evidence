Legal requirement to produce material for the I
Criminal Cases Review Commission

To: Ms Paula Vennels I
Chief Executive
Post Office Limited

The Commission believes that you are the “appropriate person” for the
purposes of section 17 Criminal Appeal Act 1995 who has possession or control
of documents or other materials which may assist the Commission in the
exercise of its functions.

This notice now imposes a requirement upon you in respect of the following:

A copy of Brian Altman QC’s report;

Either an updated summary of the decisions and actions taken by the Post
Office as a result of Brian Altman QC’s report or copies of the documents
recording those decisions and actions;

The preservation of any materials associated with the affected cases

The Commission makes a direction under section 17(2) Criminal Appeal Act
1995 that the documents and/or other materials must not be destroyed,
damaged or altered. This direction takes priority over any weeding/destruction
policies until this direction is withdrawn by the Commission.

You now have a statutory duty to provide copies of all documents and other
materials specified above.

Your duty to comply with this requirement is not affected by any obligation of
secrecy or other limitation on disclosure (including any such obligation or
limitation imposed by or by virtue of an enactment) which would otherwise
prevent the production of the document or other material to the Commission or
the giving of access to it to the Commission. You may however notify us, in
accordance with section 25 of the Criminal Appeal Act, that information
contained in the material is not to be disclosed by the Commission without your
prior consent.....o..--
