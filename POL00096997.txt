Hi all

FYI only. Please do not forward this on any further as it is merely a draft at present and we want to ensure consistency
with all Horizon Integrity cases.

 At first sight this/ these look like a good base upon which our reports can be based (As most are
fishing expeditions they will do in their current form.)

I have edited the last report (last paragraph.) because as it currently stands it is an invitation for
requests for further disclosure. (See attachment) Can you put this past Mr Jenkins.

Can you draft generic s9 statements for the witness to produce the report(s). This must set out his
expertise to comment on the system both the old and the new - we have to establish his right to speak
as an expert.

I am in favour of the descriptive words being added to the diagram (but in simple language please)
as these may have to be explained to a jury (and prosecution counsel).

Beyond that keep it simple - the secret here will be to respond to the defence expert report rather than
try to anticipate every rock to be thrown at us - unless they be obvious from the defence
statement/ interviews.

If there is a specific challenge in a case then the statement and the report can be tweaked to cover the
eventuality.

My view is that most challenges to the horizon system should now vanish away before the trial.

Any problems let me know.

I--Tarry

Hopefully it covers what you need. If you think there are areas that need expanding / changing then please let me
know. In parallel I will register the document in our Document Management system so it has a formal reference.

A couple of specific questions:

     1.  I've marked the document as "Legally privilegedd'. Is that OK? I'm told that there is no point if it is to be
        disclosed.
     2. Are you part of Post Office Ltd or Royal Mail Group?
     3. Are the diagrams in section 2.3 sufficient or do I need to add some descriptive words? There is a more detailed
        description in the referenced documents.

I also attach a copy of my Witness Statement for the West Byfleet case as this is referenced in the document and has
mush of the detailed refutations. I decided it was clearer to leave this as a referenced document rather than cutting and
pasting the r elevant sections into the new report.

You should already have copies of the other referenced documents.

Dear Jarnal,

Attached are the two existing reports I mentions regarding Horizon and Horizon Online Integrity.

I'll try and produce a further short report addressing your specific points below in the next few days.

Hopefully that will cover off your requirements.

Dear Mr Jenkins
Welcome from your annual leave and your assistance advice in the past prosecution cases and. I
understand you are assisting my colleagues at present. I need your urgent assist judge has this
morning ordered the prosecution to have the following report ready to be served within. Seven days.
 On advise Post Office Limited have appointed one of their investigators, Helen Rose as disclosure
officer dealing with Horizon challenges. She has prepared a document/ spread sheet detailing all
such cases, past and present, approximately 20 in total, although none thus far successfully argued in
court. Post Office limited have been advised to obtain, an experts report from Fujitsu UK, the
Horizon system developers, confirming the system is robust. Post Office Limited maintain the system
is robust, but in light of adverse publicity, from legal viewpoint is that defence should be given
opportunity to test the system, should they still wish to do so, on consideration of our report.

You will need to consider the Disclosure officers document/ spread sheet(see attachments) and need
to address in your report the following issues:

1) A description of the horizon system (In laymen's terms so that a jury can understand what it is
and what it does)
2) A declaration that it has yet to be attacked successfully.
3) A summary of the basic attacks made on the system concentrating on any expert reports served in
past cases. If there are none then state that no expert has yet been found by any defence team civil or
criminal to attack the system. (at the moment there seems to be little more than griping by defendants
that the system must be at fault without saying how)
4) Plainly, like all accounting systems, there is room for human error (Keying in wrong amounts etc)
are you able to state that innocent human error is unlikely to produce the types of discrepancies of
many thousands of pounds over many months.
If you require any further information or wish to discuss please do not hesitate to contact me.
