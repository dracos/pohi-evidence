1. Service Summary

1.4. The Engineering Service comprises an on-site replacement or repair service, together with
associated backup, support and administrative functions, for Counter Equipment at Branches
and other designated Post Office locations, including Counter Training Offices (CTOs), Head
Office Counter Positions. Where possible the Service Desk will provide resolution of Hardware
faults, however any Hardware faults which cannot be resolved will be passed to the
Engineering Service to initiate deployment of a Fujitsu Services Support Engineer.

1.2. On-site replacement or repair for the PostShop Branch Infrastructure is defined within the
Contract Controlled Document (CCD) entitled: “Service Integration Service, Service Description”
(SVM/SDM/SD/0010).

1.3. The Engineering Service shall comprise the following elements:

(a) On-site replacement of faulty Counter Equipment;

(b) Repair and recycling of faulty Counter Equipment;
(c) Limited Hardware asset tracking — base units only;
(d) Local Area Network (LAN) support;

(e) Portable Appliance Testing (PAT); and

(f) Service Management.

1.4. Fujitsu Services Support Engineers will be appropriately trained and the Engineering Service
shall include the use of Technical Couriers where Fujitsu Services considers it is appropriate for
such Technical Couriers to carry out the Engineering Service.

1.5. Maintenance and repair of the Counter Equipment involving on-site attendance at Post Office
premises by Fujitsu Services Support Engineers shall not interfere unduly with the ability of a
Branch to serve Customers, even where the Branch has only a single Counter Position and/or
extremely limited physical space.

Fujitsu Services shall carry out visits for maintenance or repair in accordance with the SLTs described
within section 2.3.5 of this Engineering Service, Service Description. However, the Branch Manager may
elect to defer a visit to a more convenient time and where practical it will be accommodated. For
example, in a larger Branch, if a fault occurs at the busiest time of day then the Branch Manager may
specify the earliest start time from which Fujitsu Services may carry out the maintenance or repair. In
such circumstances, the request for service shall be diagnosed fully but not carried out until after the
Branch Manager's preferred time of attendance. In this case the time in suspension shall not count
towards downtime as defined within section 2.3.5 of this Engineering Service, Service Description.

the Data Centre via PSTN) and the Branch’s existing PSTN line.

3.1.2.3 Connection with the Data Centre will be achieved using the ADSL / ISDN emulator in such a
way that the Gateway PC communicates with the Data Centre as if it was using an ADSL or
ISDN line. Such connection shall be achieved using a free phone telephone number.

3.1.2.4 The connection between a Branch and the Data Centre using the ADSL / ISDN emulator and its
subsequent disconnection after successful transmission of messages to and from the Data
Centre shall be carried out such that if the ADSL / ISDN line is restored before Fujitsu Services
