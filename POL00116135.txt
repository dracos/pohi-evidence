Subject: FW: Note of meeting with Sir Anthony Hooper
Attachment: 20130925 hooper meeting notes. pdf

All — for info, this is a note of Paula and alasdair’s meeting with Sir Tony Hooper, where they reached the conclusion
that he was the right man for the job. But I think we’re still negotiating (via BD) with his clerk over the fees, so his
appointment is not yet confirmed.

Rod — are you the point man in Susan’s absence? Let us know if you hear anything back from BD,

Thanks,
Martin

Paula, Alasdair, Susan
Here’s my note of yesterday’s meeting with Sir Anthony, which also captures the next steps as discussed with Susan.
Let me know if you have any further comments.

Thanks,
Martin
