Dear Cheryl

RE: Name of (Sub) Postmaster: Ms. Josephine Hamilton

Name of Post office: South Warnborough Post Office
FAD Code: 092 904
Your Reference; LIT/253838/XHJ,

I believe that we have now reached a position where money will only be recovered through the
commencement of proceedings.

Ms.Hamilton's Solicitors have not: beenin touch with us since the 26th September.” ~

Subject to obtaining a means report on Ms Hamilton and-a formal Witness Statement from the
auditor, I would advise that proceedings should be issued if a recovery is to be made.

I should point out that these proceedings are likely to be defended. Ms Hamilton is likely to allege
that she was inadequately trained on the Horizon System. It is possible that she may also contend
that there were errors within the Horizon software although her Solicitors have not specifically said
so. Hef letter does however hint at it. ‘In light of that I am copying this letter to Mandy Talbot.

My best estimate of the costs, assuming the matter is fully contested all the way to trial, is that your
costs will be in the region of £10,000 to £15,000 inclusive of VAT. Obviously if you were to be
unsuccessful you are likely to be ordered to pay Ms Hamilton's costs, in addition to paying.your .
own. Her costs are likely to be of a similar magnitude.

I await your instructions.

Yours sincerely

lan Herbert
