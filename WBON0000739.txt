Original list of questions provided by Second Sight regarding Spot Review 5 that drove the initial SR submission.
Email chain provides some context.

Thanks

Steve
I'm sorry for the delay in replying. There's a lot going on at the moment...
I attach a copy of Spot Review 5 which describes the allegations that have been made.

The emails that have been forwarded to you appear to describe matters that may be relevant to the allegation.
Please note that we are primarily interested in finding out the following:

1. What capabilities did the POL Bracknell team have? (As far as TC or Rem Out type transactions or Journal

adjustments are concerned)

What were the PHYSICAL or LOGICAL controls over their use of the systems available to them?

3. What audit trail is available to show the extent that they posted TC or Rem Out type transactions, or
Journal adjustments?

4. Can we reply of the COMPLETENESS of the audit trail? i.e. does it record all transactions or just

transactions meeting certain criteria? Is it protected from user manipulation?

What USER ID was used if TC type transactions or journal adjustments were posted?

Could the POL Bracknell team log on with either super user or SMPR credentials?

7. How would TC, Rem Out or Journal Adjustment type transactions executed by the POL Bracknell team be
seen by SPMR of Branches affected by those actions?

N

au

There are probably other questions / issues that will arise after you have had a preliminary look at this.

Please note that we're not really interested in what the procedures manual says about any of this. We need to look
at whether it would be possible for a rogue employee to do what is alleged and what log files would be generated
to record that activity. Please note that I have now been provided with a second batch of employee email and I
may find other emails that are potentially relevant to this matter.

Thank you for your help with this
With best wishes

Hi lan
I've been forwarded the email stream below however having not been party to prior conversations or spoken to
Susan as she is formally off-work I just need to understand the context of the enquiry as the email pdf's attached
are a collection of individual instances rather than a clear line.
My perception of what I think you need is;
1) Aclear documentation/articulation of the end-to-end Transaction Corrections process, how it is applied
and the sign-off authorities that are in place (e.g. subpostmaster acceptance etc.).

2) An understanding of how the attached email instances relate to that process and authorities.

Let me know if I'm on the right lines or not.

Thanks
