A very very drafty aunt Sally regards problem definition.

I see this as a 3 stage process (and purely for the purposes of getting a statement together for John Burton as dicussed:

1. Working Problem descritpion
(This being the very first draft)

2. Sanitised problem description (primarily for our own purposes - so we agree what the Is / Is not of the situation is)
See within

3. Management speak problem description for review with John Burton
