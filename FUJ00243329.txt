Good morning Chris,

Thanks for getting back to me. Appreciate there’s a lot going on for you on the topic of Horizon just now, but hopefully
my enquiry won’t be too problematic.

GRO ___I—butessentially ! am investigating an
up I ) here, and the evidence of the relevant

Happy to discuss further on the phone — my number ist

my discussions with POL so 6 far that the current/relevant version of the Horizon software is Significantly different from
the version at the heart of the public enquiry — as per the judgement alluded to below.

I'll be in the office this afternoon if that suits you for a call, or most of the day tomorrow (with the usual police caveat
that I can be sent to an incident with no notice at any point).

Kind regards,

Dear Mr Newson

I have been passed your message by the team within Fujitsu Services Limited that looks after the delivery of
contractual services to Post Office Limited in relation to the Horizon System.

I am a solicitor in Fujitsu’s legal team and thought it appropriate to reach out to you directly given the legal nature of
your request below. I should mention that I am a part of the legal team supporting Fujitsu Services Limited as a Core
Participant in the ongoing Post Office IT Horizon Inquiry.

Would it be possible to have a call by telephone or on teams to discuss your request and how Fujitsu Services Limited
can co-operate with the investigation?

Best regards

Chris

Good evening Daniel,

I was passed your contact details by Danny Saunders at Post Office Ltd, in relation to an investigation I am making into

(IRRELEVANT! at a Post Office branch in Scotland.
I have been directed towards the Dec 2019 judgement by Mr Justice Fraser, in which he concludes that Horizon post-
2019 is a different beast to the version(s) that are at the centre of the well-publicised and ongoing enquiry, however
given the current situation, I thought it would be beneficial to have an input from someone suitable at Fujitsu to
explain in layman’s terms why the data from the current or recent version of Horizon can be relied upon in contrast to
it’s predecessors. (In light of the ongoing enquiry, any prosecution that involves data from Horizon is going to need an
extra strand or two of evidence to give confidence that it can be relied upon. In the current climate, it would be to
easy for the defence to muddy the waters and claim Horizon cannot be trusted without some robust evidence that this
is not the same system that lies at the centre of the controversy, and COPFS might need some extra reassurance that it
is safe to proceed with a case).
