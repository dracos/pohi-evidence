POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY

FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF ALAN GEORGE D’ALVAREZ

|, MR ALAN GEORGE D’ALVAREZ, will say as follows:

INTRODUCTION

1. | am currently a Programme Executive at Fujitsu Services Limited (“Fujitsu”) working
in the Europe region, a position that | have held since April 2018. | am not currently
involved with the Horizon IT system or Fujitsu’s Post Office Account.

2. This witness statement is made on behalf of Fujitsu to assist the Post Office Horizon
IT Inquiry with the matters set out in the Rule 9 Request provided to Fujitsu on
11 March 2022 and a series of follow-up questions provided to me by the Inquiry on
1 July 2022 (the “Request”), to the extent that | have direct knowledge of such
matters.

3. The topics set out in the Inquiry’s Request that | am able to comment on relate to
matters that occurred up to 25 years ago. These relate to my involvement in the
design and development of an automated key management system for Legacy
Horizon in the period prior to the national rollout, and my involvement in the

replanning, pilots and rollout of the Horizon Online system from 2008 to 2010. | have

Page 1 of 26

WITN04800100

tried to remember relevant events to the best of my ability. However, there are areas
where my recollection is unclear or limited.

4, Where | have seen documents relevant to the Inquiry’s Request for the purpose of
preparing this statement or where | have referred to documents, these documents are
referred to using references WITN480_01/1 — WITN480_01/13 and are listed in the
index accompanying this statement. To the extent that these documents have not
already been provided to the Inquiry, they are exhibited to this statement.

BACKGROUND

5. | joined ICL Pathway Limited (“ICL Pathway”) in March 1997 to lead the delivery of
security related elements of the Horizon IT system. At the time, | had previous
experience of secure systems from my work with the Metropolitan Police. | continued
in this role until December 2000.

6. | subsequently had a number of other roles on the Horizon project:

a. January 2001 to August 2002: Applications Delivery Manager, Post Office
Account: Responsible for creating and running a combined applications and
infrastructure delivery capability from the previous five delivery units
operating across the account. The capability was responsible for all
application and managed infrastructure changes applied to the Horizon
system to support the transformation of Post Office Limited (“Post Office”)
from a supplier of postal and government services to a high street presence
extending into financial, travel and other retail services.

b. September 2002 to June 2005: Director of Delivery, Post Office Account:

Responsible for setting up and running the combined Unit responsible for

Page 2 of 26
WITN04800100
WITN04800100

design, development, integration, testing and deployment of new solutions.
The Unit met the challenges of the new IT Roadmap initiatives whilst
delivering to the Post Office change programme.

c. May 2009 to December 2010: Programme Director Horizon Online, Royal
Mail Account: Due to significant delays, | was assigned to take responsibility
for delivering Horizon Online. | led the re-planning and successful delivery
of the programme.

JOINING ICL PATHWAY AND THE HORIZON PROJECT

7. When | joined the Horizon programme in March 1997, the programme was working
on various “releases” of the Horizon system. At the time, there was Release 1A, 1B,
1C and then Release 2. The pilot of Release 1A had already been completed by
March 1997 and, as | had no involvement in it, | cannot comment on the date that it
started. | understand this pilot to be what the Inquiry refers to as the “Initial Go Live”
pilot. At the time | joined, Release 1B was in the final preparation for deployment to a
limited number of Post Office branches — about 200. Release 1B occurred around
approximately June 1997. Release 1C followed in early 1998 and | believe the pilot
was then extended to a further 100 post offices. | understand these two pilots to be
what the Inquiry has referred to as the “further software releases at approximately
200 — 300 post office branches between 1997 — 1998”. | do not understand the
Inquiry’s references to a “full live trial’ of the Horizon IT system. However, | was
involved in the Horizon project during the pilot of New Release 2, which commenced

in late 1999, and which involved a larger number of Post Office branches than the

Page 3 of 26
WITN04800100
WITN04800100

previous pilots (Release 2 having been renamed following the Benefits Agency's
withdrawal from the project). | address that involvement below.

8. From the time | joined ICL Pathway, up to and including the release of New Release
2, | was involved only in the security aspects of the Horizon system, and any aspects
of this statement relating to that period are given on that basis. The team working with
me on these security aspects numbered up to 50 people, but included Roy Birkinshaw
(Security Development Team Lead), Dave Johns (Security Architect), Belinda

Fairthorne (Security Consultant) and Tom Parker (Technical Security Consultant).

IDENTIFYING DEFICIENCIES IN THE SECURITY OF THE HORIZON IT SYSTEM

9. When | joined the Horizon IT project in March 1997, | assessed the system security
requirements that ICL Pathway had contracted to deliver and the solution it had
proposed to meet those requirements. | identified a number of areas where we
needed additional or different solutions to ensure compliance with the contractual
requirements. These were an automated key management system (“KMS”) and
processes to address requirements for access controls in relation to privileged users
as a result of the completion of the Access Control Policy

10.A key feature of the security system, when | joined the project, was that in order for a
postmaster to access the Horizon system on their Post Office branch counter, they
would need to have a password and a physical cryptographic memory card (a “key
card”). This solution was to address the requirement for two-factor authentication at

the Post Office counter.

Page 4 of 26
WITN04800100
WITN04800100

11. This was to address Post Office security concerns around unauthorised people being
able to access the Horizon counter. Specifically, a password-only system was not
thought to be enough and system access requiring a physical device and a password
was implemented. This decision and the discussions that led to it occurred before |
joined the Horizon programme, and so | was not party to them.

12.While | was not involved in the pilot of Release 1A, my understanding from my later
work was that, in that pilot, there was no key card entry system at the Horizon
counters. Given my lack of involvement in the Release 1A pilot, | cannot comment as
to why a key card entry system was not present in Release 1A. However, by the
Release 1B pilot, such a system had been added.

13.Prior to the Release 1B pilot, it was identified that the recovery process in place for
the pilot was not a supportable solution or operationally fit for purpose at scale. By
the “recovery process”, | mean the process by which a key card would be replaced if
it was lost by a postmaster.

14.The recovery process during the Release 1B pilot was a manual Diffie-Hellman
exchange done over the phone between the postmaster and the Horizon support
desk. A Diffie-Hellman exchange is a secure means of cryptographic recovery.

15. If a postmaster lost their key card, they would phone the Horizon support desk. In
order to go through the recovery process, the postmaster had to click through
15 screens of lengthy random alphanumeric numbers on their Horizon counter, and
provide those numbers to a member of the Horizon support team within a secure
location at the Horizon support desk. The support desk would, in turn, also click

through 15 screens of lengthy random alphanumeric numbers and they would provide

Page 5 of 26
WITN04800100
WITN04800100

those to the postmasters for entry on their counter. This process verified the
authenticity of the counter and the postmaster’s identity and enabled a secure key,
unique to that post office, to be downloaded onto a spare blank key card held at the
post office. At the end of the process, the blank key card would be loaded with a new
secure key and the post master would be able to access the system.

16.This was a really cumbersome and time-consuming process. A Post Office branch
could not trade until this process was completed as the postmaster would not have
access to their counter. The postmaster and service desk also had to do the exchange
over the phone, so there were often miscommunications. This process took, at best,
15 minutes to complete.

17.This manual approach to key card recovery was demonstrated by the Horizon
security team to Jeremy Fawkes (Head of IT Security at the Post Office) and Gareth
Lewis (Director of Security, Benefits Agency) in March 1997. At a meeting that
followed the demonstration, Jeremy raised that the manual approach was not a
supportable solution or operationally fit for purpose at scale, and placed an action on
the Horizon security team to look for a more sustainable solution.

18.My understanding, which | think may have come from conversations with Jeremy
Fawkes, was that the Post Office was concerned about the business impact of a
postmaster losing their key card and the time it would take to recover the key card to
enable the post office to trade. My understanding at the time was that if the system
was not available to a postmaster, the Post Office would have had to pay
compensation to the affected postmasters for loss of trade, and this was a big concern

for them. In addition, ICL Pathway had the challenge of refreshing keys held on the

Page 6 of 26
WITN04800100
WITN04800100

key card periodically to conform to the Communications-Electronic Security Group
(‘CESG’) guidelines which the manual recovery process would not be able to support.

19. My understanding is that whilst the Joint Authority (Post Office and Benefits Agency)
had signed off on the pilot of Release 1B, they would not sign off general deployment
of the system until a more acceptable key card recovery solution was in place. |
believe that decision was taken around the time the roll-out of Release 1B was
approved, though my recollection is not certain.

OBTAINING APPROVAL FOR A KEY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

20.1 was actioned to provide a more sustainable and supportable solution for key card
recovery, which after analysis of the operational and support requirements led to the
proposal of implementing an automated secure key management system (“KMS”).

21.The contract for the Horizon system between ICL Pathway, the Post Office and the
Benefits Agency (the “Horizon Contract”), and the business needs reflected in the
Horizon Contract, were the main drivers for any design and development on the
project, coupled with the supportability of any proposed solution. My understanding
of the Horizon Contract was that ICL Pathway had signed up to deliver a secure
system. The system we had in place during Release 1B was secure, but the recovery
process for a lost key card was complex and not sustainable for a large number of
post offices, nor would it support an estate wide key refresh.

22.Of course, | understood that the Horizon IT Contract did not say that we specifically
needed to deliver a KMS (and as | was not involved in the negotiations of the Horizon
Contract, | cannot comment on why the matter was not considered as part of the

original negotiations). However, after an assessment of the options, it was concluded

Page 7 of 26
WITN04800100
WITN04800100

by the security team that an automated KMS was the appropriate way forward for
reasons of usability and to avoid the impacts to the Post Office business of not having
one in place (as more particularly explained at paragraphs 16 to 18 above).

23.A big challenge was that we contracted to use the “Red Pike” cryptographic algorithm
sourced from the CESG and that a KMS would need to conform to the mandated
polices and controls applicable to cryptographic algorithms supplied by CESG.

24.The KMS proposal, prepared by myself, Roy Birkenshaw and Dave Johns, was
presented to the ICL Pathway Board that consisted of John Bennet (CEO), Tony
Oppenheim (Finance Director), John Dicks (Requirements Director), Martyn Bennett
(Director, Security and Risk Management), Liam Foley (Business Development
Director), Terry Austin (Director of Delivery) and Steve Muchow (Service Director).
This presentation occurred around July or August 1997, and | believe the proposal
was documented in a document titled ‘the KMS Solution Overview’. | recall resistance
to the proposal and a debate with Tony Oppenheim, who questioned why ICL
Pathway needed to absorb the cost of additional security. This would be a significant
investment for ICL Pathway as the costs of developing the KMS would not be
recoverable from the Post Office/Benefits Agency under the charging mechanisms in
the Horizon Contract. In particular, his view was that the Post Office and Benefits
Agency had signed up to a Microsoft Windows NT based solution, which included the
limitations of that technology. Microsoft NT is a computer operating system which
supports a computer's basic functions. Part of such systems contain an element of
security controls to protect a device, data stored and the transfer of data. However,

Windows NT did not support the specific requirements associated with the

Page 8 of 26
WITN04800100
WITN04800100

management of CESG supplied algorithms. During the presentation, the proposal
was approved given the need for it and the overall benefit it would bring to both
service and the customer.

DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT, TESTING AND ACCEPTANCE OF THE KMS

Design

25.At the time, the processes for design and development of new software at ICL
Pathway followed a standard approach. It was a typical waterfall methodology that
was standard for IT projects at the time. The steps were business analysis, design,
build, integration and then test. My recollection is that the following individuals led
teams that were responsible for this process on the Horizon project prior to the
national rollout of the Horizon system:
a. Dick Long: Design
b. Chris Humphreys: Development
c. Chris Wannell: Integration
26.In relation to the design and development process for the KMS, | believe that there
would have been templates for designs and testing. There was a defined set of
processes at each stage of the methodology and there should be templates showing
that. | recall dealing with an ICL capability, headed up by Jules Oliver, called
“Application Management” who assigned a team to work on the design and build of
the KMS. This team was led by Roy Birkinshaw who reported into me. | was the
approval authority for the delivery plans and key requirement documents.
27.Further information about the design of the KMS may be found in the Key

Management High Level Design Document dated 10 March 1999 (WITN480_01/1).

WITN04800100
WITN04800100

Testing

28.The KMS then went through testing and user acceptance. While | have a general
awareness of ICL Pathway’s testing procedures as a member of the Horizon
Programme, | was not responsible for testing. | cannot remember who was
responsible for testing at the time.

29.Based on my general understanding, at the time, ICL Pathway had the following test
phases:

a. System Test

b. Security Test

c. System Integration Test

d. Performance and Integrity Test
e. Release Test

30.Within ICL Pathway, we made use of agencies and partner organisations to resource
test teams, but any testing carried out by ICL Pathway was managed internally. The
customer was responsible for the User Acceptance Test (“UAT”) and supplied their
own team for this.

31.1 have had an opportunity to consider WITN480_01/6, which are minutes of a meeting
| attended between ICL Pathway and Utimaco on 5 November 1998. Utimaco were
the suppliers of the Virtual Private Network (“VPN”) hardware devices that were
chosen for Horizon. A VPN establishes an encrypted link to securely transmit data
and, in Horizon, was used to encrypt data between the data centres, Post Office
branches and other third party interfaces. My recollection is that the design for

Horizon’s VPN was completed by Alex Robinson supported by Utimaco, who supplied

Page 10 of 26
WITN04800100
WITN04800100

the encryption devices. Utimaco would provide support to the Fujitsu test teams
validating this element of the solution. As such, if a PiniCL was raised that was due
to a fault in the supplied VPN encryption devices, a support ticket would be raised
against Utimaco to investigate the issue and, where required, Utimaco would deliver
a fix.
32.The KMS went through the Security Test, System Integration Test, Release Test and
UAT. The Security Test Team reported to me. Defects raised against security
products, including the KMS, were triaged by myself, Dave Johns and Roy Birkinshaw
prior to being allocated to teams for resolution. The defect management process
generally operated as follows:
a. A PinlCL would be raised by the test team to record a system fault that is
causing a test failure within a test script.
b. Defects would be triaged to (i) confirm that the test failure is as a result of a
fault in the solution (as a test failure may not be a system fault, for instance
because the test script was incorrect or an incorrect procedure followed, (ii)
determine which resolver group (team) to allocate the defect to for
resolution and (iii) propose defect impact and priority.
c. The Post Office and Benefits Agency, as Joint Authority, would confirm the
business impact of the defect.
d. Fixes would be delivered by the resolver group and the test would be re-
run, or the fix inspected (in the case of amendments to documentation).
e. At the conclusion of each test phase, a test report would be completed

which identified any defects that were unresolved at the point of exiting that

Page 11 of 26
WITN04800100
WITN04800100

test phase. It is possible that a defect open at the end of one test phase
may be resolved in a future test phase and prior to the completion of all test
phases.

f. At the point acceptance was reviewed, any unresolved defects would be
included in an acceptance report. From recollection, a system could not go
live with any open defects that were considered “high priority” by the Joint
Authority, and any “medium priority” would need to be supported by a work
round procedure where applicable. The Joint Authority would take into
account the open defects as part of their decision to go live with the solution.

33.Whilst | do not recollect specific defects | have reviewed a copy of a PinlCL,
PC0005088, related to the KMS (WITN480_01/7). | would say that this is typical of a
fault found in testing, where a security issue was highlighted in respect of system
access. As can be seen in the PinICL record, changes were made to remove this
access mode and an alternative secure access route and procedure was introduced.
The PinlCL also confirms that the proposed resolution was approved by Jeremy
Fawkes. Defects would generally fall within the following categories: Technical
(requiring a system change to resolve), Process (requiring a change of
approach/procedure to resolve), Documentation (requiring an amendment to
documentation). The above PinICL PC0005088 is an example of a Process issue.

Acceptance

34.Following testing, the final KMS solution was then signed off through acceptance.
Generally, it was the programme managers who dealt with acceptance at the time. |

am not sure, but | recall that the programme manager who took us through the pilots

Page 12 of 26
WITN04800100
WITN04800100

was Martyn Hughes. Martyn reported to Terry Austin who oversaw software
development, test and deployment. He would oversee all software development up
to acceptance into service.

35.1 am not aware of any changes to the acceptance criteria for the security of the
Horizon system during the period | was involved in the development of the KMS or at
any other time.

Delays

36. The Post Office and Benefits Agency allowed the pilot of Release 1C to go ahead
without the KMS being deployed, though | have no knowledge as to why that decision
was made. However, the KMS was required for the larger scale pilot of New Release
2.

37.From my perspective, the security and development of the KMS contributed to the
delay of the New Release 2 pilot and the subsequent roll out of Horizon for two major
reasons:

a. We had to implement the security requirements from the Access Control
Policy (WITN480_01/2) and the Security Functional Specification
Document (WITN480_01/3), which described the technical security
specifications for the Horizon system. | note that | reviewed the Pathway
Security Policy dated 8 October 1996 (WITN480_01/4) in order to assist
with my recollection of the two documents just mentioned. Many of these
requirements were not previously implemented in Releases 1A, 1B, and 1C,
but they were required for New Release 2. In fact, | believe the Access

Control Policy had not even been signed off when | joined in March 1997

Page 13 of 26
WITN04800100
WITN04800100

and when the earlier pilots were under way. Developing the technical control
procedures to meet these two documents took time.

b. My team also needed to clear defects raised through testing and resolve
them prior to the go live of New Release 2. Not all defects that we had
agreed with the Post Office should be fixed before going live had, in fact,
been fixed in the planned timescales. | think | needed another two months
from my original test plan to get through my defect clearance. | am not
aware of whether sub-postmasters were informed of these defects, and it
would not have been part of my role or responsibilities to interface with sub-
postmasters. The Post Office had in place two people who were
accountable for overseeing security testing. | cannot remember their
names, though the first name of one of them may have been Cliff. They
were accountable for reviewing all defects and agreeing the business
priority of those defects. They also reviewed the position around unresolved
defects at the point of exiting the security test phase, and they audited test
results and PinICL content for accuracy. | was not sighted on any of the
reporting these Post Office representatives may have done (including to
whom they reported) within the wider Post Office organisation.

38.Having reviewed a copy of the Exception Plan for Delivering KMS (WITN480_01/8), |
am reminded that a decision was made to split the delivery of the KMS into two phases
in order to meet the New Release 2 deadline. As the Exception Plan highlights, the
sheer volume of work resulted in the development team falling behind schedule. Three

options were considered and the option agreed was to phase the delivery of the KMS.

Page 14 of 26
WITN04800100
WITN04800100

The first phase was to deliver all solution components required to support key refresh
associated with lost/not working Post Master Memory Cards (PMCCs). The second
phase, to be delivered post go live of New Release 2, was to deliver the additional
functionality required to enable a global key change across the whole estate to take
place. Global encryption key changes would be undertaken every 12 months and
therefore the second delivery phase would need to be implemented within 12 months
of New Release 2 going live. | recall that this second phase was delivered within the
12 month period. The document titled ‘Requirements for KMS at CSR+’, which is
referred to in the Exception Plan, is also exhibited to my statement at WITN480_01/9.

39. Besides the matters described above at paragraphs 37 and 38 above, | do not recall
any other matters under my supervision which caused delays to Release 1C or New
Release 2. My recollection is that no changes were made to the original specification.

40.However, the implementation of security was not alone in causing the delay to the
New Release 2 pilot. While | do not recall the details, there were a number of other
delays across the project in the run up to the New Release 2 pilot.

THE NEW RELEASE 2 PILOT

41.| do not recall the specific nature of problems or issues that were raised during the
New Release 2 pilot.

42.Generally, | understand that during the New Release 2 pilot, incidents were raised
through the service desk for any issues encountered. Where the resolution required
a code fix, this would be passed to 4" line support where a defect would also be
raised and tagged to the incident. The defect would be annotated with the cause of

the defect and the resolution. | suggest that the incident system may be searched for

Page 15 of 26
WITN04800100
WITN04800100

any ticket raised by a pilot site that has a corresponding defect number to identify
technical issues raised during the pilot phase.

FITNESS FOR PURPOSE OF THE HORIZON SYSTEM PRIOR TO ROLLOUT

43. Before the national rollout of the Horizon system, a penetration test was conducted by
an independent third party appointed by the Post Office in order to validate the security
of the Horizon IT system. | do not independently recall the name of the organisation
that conducted the penetration test, but | have reviewed ICL Pathway Change
Proposal No. 1987 (WITN480_01/10), which indicates it was Admiral Management
Services Limited.

44.A penetration test is a test to assess the security controls implemented in the
production or “live” environment. A report was prepared by the tester with critical, high,
medium and low issues. | believe it was sent to Barry Proctor, who was the Chief
Information Security Officer at |CL Pathway and the originator/sponsor of ICL Pathway
Change Proposal No. 1987. My security team then reviewed that report with the Post
Office and agreed with them which issues needed to be fixed. We raised defects for
any issues that we had agreed needed to be fixed.

45.| also recall that a team from Fujitsu Japan came to ICL Pathway to conduct an audit
of the Horizon project around the time the business was negotiating the new contract
with Post Office after the Benefits Agency had pulled out. | think, but | am not sure,
that it was mainly a design audit and Dick Long and Dave Johns were directly
involved. | recall being asked questions about the KMS as part of that audit. | have
no other recollections of the audit. | do not remember receiving its outcomes or to

whom they might have been addressed.

Page 16 of 26
WITN04800100
WITN04800100

46.1 did not have any concerns in respect of the fitness for purpose of Horizon.

HORIZON ONLINE

47.|n 2008, | was not working on the Horizon project but was working on the bid for the
Passport Enrollment as part of the National Identity Scheme.

48.At that time, | was asked by Lester Young and Pete Jeram to conduct a review of the
Horizon Online project. | understood that the Horizon Online project was failing to
deliver, encountering constant delays and that the Post Office was losing confidence
in the project. From my review, | concluded that the project was driven to achieve
dates rather than quality. Evidence of this was that test phases were reported as
having started when a number of the solution components required to make the
testing valid had not been completed. There were also many cases of development
being reported as complete when the supporting design was still incomplete or in draft
status. | recall that a number of the individuals interviewed as part of the review openly
stated that the focus was on getting milestone sign off without due consideration of
the completeness of the deliverables associated with that milestone.

49.1 do not recall them in detail, but | made several recommendations in a report following
my review. In preparing this statement, | have not seen a copy of the report and am
unable to recall identifying details about it.

50.1 then worked on a replan of the project based on my recommendations for the
remainder of 2008. The replanning involved: (i) a review of Horizon Online’s scope
and associated deliverables, and confirmation that these met the requirements of the
contract, (ii) a review of progress at the time against deliverables, (iii) a review of

estimates as to time and resources for remaining deliverables, based on actual

Page 17 of 26
WITN04800100
WITN04800100

figures from completed deliverables, (iv) the scheduling of remaining activities to
complete outstanding deliverables, (v) a review of the schedule and an assessment
of schedule contingency, (vi) a review of overall resource requirements and forecast
costs, and (vii) a review and update of the programme Risk, Issues, Assumptions and
Dependencies log against a revised schedule for completion.

51.The replan involved a range of individuals over five stages:

a. Stage 1: This involved all Fujitsu Horizon Online work stream leads,
supported by their team leads. These were David Johns (HNG-X Chief
Architect), Roger Goldsmith (Application Development Lead), Vince
Cochrane (Infrastructure Lead), Debbie Richardson (Test and Validation
Lead), and Lee Farnham (Post Office Test Assurance Lead). | also recall
involvement of the Integration Lead and the Deployment Lead, but do not
remember their names.

b. Stage 2: This was an independent validation of the replan by the Fujitsu
Delivery Assurance team

c. Stage 3: These were joint sessions with the Post Office programme
management team (led by Mark Burley). The primary focus at this stage
was on validating customer dependencies and addressing scope and
timelines.

d. Stage 4: This was the Fujitsu governance approval process, led by the
Assurance team.

e. Stage 5: This was final approval of the replan by the Post Office.

Page 18 of 26
WITN04800100
WITN04800100

52.In 2009 | was asked to become Programme Director, which was authorized by the
Fujitsu Head of Core Services at the time, Peter Jeram.

Initial pilot problems

53.1 do not recall the specific problems with the Horizon Online solution that arose during
the initial pilots of Horizon Online, including any failures with the Systems
Management Toolset. However, having seen an email that | sent dated 19 February
2010, | am reminded that there were a number of issues encountered with the
deployment process which were resolved prior to going into the large scale pilot
(WITN480_01/5).

54. | do recall that there were a number of defects going into the pilots which, | believe,
would have been documented in a test report that was produced as part of the
acceptance process. However, none of those defects were assessed as sufficient to
stop the pilot. We would have assessed those defects with the Post Office for potential
business impact and technical impact, and agreed workarounds where required.

55. Incidents were raised through the service desk for any issues encountered in the pilot.
Where the resolution required a code fix, this would be passed to 4" line support
where a defect would be raised and tagged to the incident. The defect would be
annotated with the cause of the defect and the resolution. | suggest that the incident
system be searched for any ticket raised by a pilot site that has a corresponding
defect number to identify technical issues raised during the pilot phase.

Suspension of high volume pilot

56. Shortly after the high volume pilot commenced, a substantial number of branches in

the pilot reported that the Horizon Online counter had “lost connectivity” and so they

Page 19 of 26
WITN04800100
WITN04800100

were not able to trade. This issue would recur about two or three times a week,
impacting a significant number of post offices in the pilot, and it would last about 10
to 20 minutes.

57.There was an intermittent issue encountered where the Branch Data Base locked,
which stopped communications between the central database and the branch, so no
transactions were able to be processed at the impacted pilot offices. As such, the
high volume pilot was extended until the issue was resolved. After assessment, we
quickly traced it to the Oracle code in use on Horizon Online.

58.An incident was raised against Oracle and we initially had to demonstrate that it was
not an issue with the way we had implemented the solution. Oracle provided us with
enhanced diagnostic tools and we fed diagnostic data back to them. We also had
Oracle consultants from the Netherlands and the United States fly in to look into the
issue. | also invited James Stinchcombe, an employee of Fujitsu though not working
on Horizon Online at the time, to review the issue due to his knowledge of the Horizon
architecture.

59. Once Oracle accepted that the fault was in their code they provided a technical patch
to fix the issue within a week. The patch tested positively in terms of resolving the
issue. There is a very technical explanation on why the patch worked, and | do not
understand it fully. Even though the patch worked, we undertook a full regression test
to ensure that we did not break anything else on Horizon Online by adding the patch.
We then applied the patch to the pilot Post Office branches and we monitored the

outcomes with the Post Office. It took about 8 weeks from the incident first occurring

to the patch being deployed. The patch operated for four weeks in the live pilot, during
which time there were no repeats of the Oracle issue.

60.At the conclusion of the pilot phase, a report titled ‘Acceptance Report for HNG-X
Acceptance Gateway 4’ (WITN480_01/11) was prepared to document how the
Horizon Online system had met the relevant acceptance criteria and to support
approval to move into the deployment phase. This report was presented to the
Acceptance Board, which met on 29 June 2010 and approved the deployment of
Horizon Online. | reviewed both the Acceptance Report for HNG-X Acceptance
Gateway 4 and the minutes of the acceptance board meeting on 29 June 2010 (which
provides details of the meeting, including attendees) (WITN480_01/12:) to refresh my
memory of these events.

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS REGARDING SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS AND DESIGN

61.My understanding was that the requirements for the Horizon system were set by the
Joint Authority (i.e. Post Office and the Benefits Agency) or, after the Benefits
Agency's involvement ended, the Post Office. These requirements formed part of the
contract that ICL Pathway or Fujitsu had to deliver. ICL Pathway/Fujitsu were
responsible for producing design specifications and had to demonstrate that they met
the requirements in the Horizon contract. These specifications were subject to
approval by the Joint Authority or the Post Office (as applicable).

62.The process followed for producing design specifications was that there were a
number of high level requirements specification documents produced by ICL Pathway
subject matter experts. These documents extracted the requirements from the

various contract schedules into a single source specific to different areas of the

Page 21 of 26
WITN04800100
WITN04800100

solution. These documents outlined how the Horizon Solution would meet the
contractual requirements applicable to that area. The two documents applicable to
my security work stream were the Security Functional Specification and the Access
Control Policy, with an additional document, Requirements for Key Management
(WITN480_1/13), that was not specific to contractual requirements. These
documents were reviewed by ICL Pathway and the Joint Authority. Reviewers would
submit comments on a template provided with the document. The document author
is required to resolve all comments submitted through the review process and
agreeing resolution with reviewers prior to submitting the document for approval. The
document approver is responsible for assuring that all comments received through
the document review process have been satisfactorily addressed prior to approving
the document. Technical designs would then be produced to conform to the
requirement specification documents and these went through the same review and
approval process. This process was used for both Horizon and HNG-X.
ASSESSMENT OF CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THE HORIZON SYSTEM AND

DEVELOPMENT PROCESS

Robustness
63.As a preliminary point, | note that | was not involved in the Horizon IT system

throughout its life, and so | am only able assess its robustness‘ from the perspective

! Defined by the Inquiry as including: “(a) the accuracy and integrity of the data recorded and processed
by the Horizon IT System (b) the extent to which deficiencies in the Horizon IT System were capable of
causing and / or caused apparent discrepancies or shortfalls in the branch accounts (c) the ability of the
Horizon IT System to identify errors in data and discrepancies or shortfalls in branch accounts and the
cause of the same and (d) the ability of the Horizon IT System to continue to operate satisfactorily in the
presence of adverse conditions.”

of the roles | held during the periods of time | held them (as listed at paragraph 6
above).

64. During my involvement, which included some time prior to the national rollout as well
as and during the development and rollout of Horizon Online, | did not have concerns
regarding the robustness of the Horizon IT system. As is typical of any large and
complex IT system, defects did occur. However, in my experience, these were fully
visible to the customer (whether Post Office or the Joint Authority) and, where
required, agreed workarounds were put in place. | cannot comment on the matters
that may have been communicated to the Government, as | would not have been
involved in any such discussions
Interaction between teams

65.During the period of time prior to the national rollout of Horizon, | led the Security
Delivery Team. This team was part of the Delivery Organisation that was headed up
by Terry Austin. | reported into the Release Programme Managers for the deliveries
appropriate to each of the releases (e.g. Releases 1A, 1B, 1C). | am unable to recall
the Release Programme Managers, save that | recall reporting into Martyn Hughes
for a period of time in relation to New Release 2.

66.During my involvement with Horizon Online, | was the Programme Director
accountable for all solution delivery team, including Applications, Infrastructure,
Integration, Test & Validation and Deployment. | reported to the Post Office Business
Unit Director, Gavin Bounds.

67.| believe there was sufficient interaction between teams in both my assignments. In

the period prior to the rollout of Horizon, and while | was working on the KMS, my
