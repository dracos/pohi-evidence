Hi Jeff / Zdravko

Not sure who picks this up but see below a list of branches who have contacted me

regarding issues they are having with their IT kit:

¢ Neil - branch is SPRINGWOOD POST OFFICE IN LIVERPOOL - NO PRINTER SINCE

21st June

¢ 323217 — Ulverston Outreach - One of our 3 outreach machines has now been
