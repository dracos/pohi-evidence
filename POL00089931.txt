Operational Business Change Horizon Operating Instructions
Foreword

1. FOREWORD

As Horizon rolls out across the network it will make new
demands of all of us. In particular, it will become even more
vital that changes which affect post offices are effectively
managed and recorded. Without this, there is a serious risk
that we will compromise the service available from the
automated platform, in turn creating problems for customer
service, losing sales and - potentially - adversely affecting
our clients.

In order to ensure that these problems do not occur we have
to put in place formal controls and procedures across the
business as a whole and in our contract with ICL Pathway.
This will enable us to operate the system in the most
effective way.

This operating instructions booklet explains the purpose of
Operational Business Change and the implications of it for
some of our day to day activities. The instructions - which
are mandatory - also give details of when and how you will
need to apply the new procedures.

Effective application of these new procedures and controls
will allow us all to act consistently and to manage the
impact of Horizons costs. It is vital to the business that we
ensure that they are applied every time for every change.
Your support for this is essential - so please take the time to
ensure that you understand these procedures - and how
they affect your work area.

Operational Business Change Horizon Operating Instructions
Introduction

3. __ INTRODUCTION

What do we mean by ‘operational business
change’?
It refers to the alteration of, or an addition to, existing products or
services or to changes to outlet information. These instructions contain

a specific list of outlet related changes but, broadly they will include
such changes as the following:

C1 changes to products or services, from a change to the price of a
stamp to adding a new product to the system

1 changes to outlets, which can range from an alteration to the
number of counter positions to introducing a new post office

Why do we need to do this?

There are a number of areas that we need to manage in a different way
now that we have an automated system on the counter. If a change
affects equipment on the counter, or the way that it is used, then we
have to give ICL Pathway adequate notice.

More than ever before we need to consistently manage all business
activities. In order to do this we need to have a robust change control
process to control the impact of change on our business.

Purpose of these Instructions

These instructions are designed to help you identify which changes
need specific action and what to do about a change. The target is to
ensure that the same types of change are recorded consistently across
the business.

Structure of the Instructions

This section of the instructions gives an overview of the need for
controlling change information. The following sections are

OQ Acombined index and list of the types of changes covered by these
instructions.
1 The instructions on how to make a change happen - including what

authorisations are required (if any) and how soon changes should
be notified.

About these Instructions

These instructions describe the procedures for delivering information to
ICL Pathway about changes to our outlets. They are of three distinct
Kinds:

1 Alert procedures - Emergency procedures to notify ICL Pathway of a
problem and enable them to deal effectively with it.

Alert Procedures - General

5. ALERT PROCEDURES - GENERAL

General

Alert procedures are defined as procedures to notify ICL Pathway of an
(==) unplanned problem and enable them to deal effectively with it.

In the case of outlets this means unplanned events that fall into two
categories. (See outline graphic on the left)

© Delayed opening or closures of less than one days duration

eustomers I I Standard
Be

Regional Unplanned (emergency) closures

Unplanned (emergency) closures, in broad terms, fall into two categories,
short term and long term, and are defined below.

Other unplanned events, such as equipment failures and damaged or
stolen equipment are covered in the Horizon Counter Operating

(=a) Instructions.

Definitions
Delayed opening and temporary closure of less than one day

These are when the outlet fails to open at the normal time but the Postmaster expects
to be able to provide a normal service on the same day or when an outlet closes for a
few hours during the day. Examples are staff absences, local access restrictions, safe
clock incorrectly set, power failures, illness. ICL Pathway do not require notification of
outlet closures of less than one day.

Short term closure

These are when a closure is for one day to three working days. Short term closures will
typically be due to emergency situations, e.g. audit closure, safe failure, minor office
damage.

POCL must request ICL Pathway to invoke procedures to suspend the foreign
encashment counts for customers who would normally use the outlet.
Long term closure

These are when a closure is for four or more working days. Such closures result from
more serious circumstances in the outlet, e.g. bereavement, a major fire, flooding or
other environmental problems.

POCL must request that ICL Pathway transfer benefit encashment and payments to
an alternative nominated outlet. Customers must be directed to this outlet.

Operational Business Change Horizon Operating Instructions
Alert Procedures - General

Time scales

Whilst the time definitions for short and long term closure dictate the
correct response they must also be sufficiently flexible to reflect the
operational needs. Accordingly short term procedures should remain in
place until formally reassessed and ICL Pathway notified. Any necessary
flexibility required in defining the closure period will need to be fully
discussed between the Regional Helpline and the HSH.

Who is involved

The main drivers and managers of unplanned emergency changes in the
Regions are the Postmasters, Regional Helplines and Retail Network
Managers (RNMs).

Postmasters and RNMs will provide the ‘on the ground’ operational
assessment necessary to both report and then evaluate, where
appropriate, the status of a closure.

The RNM and the retail line generally will be responsible for providing
1 an impact assessment where long term closures occur and for ensuring
I the Regional Helpline are updated with the circumstances affecting the
duration of closures.

The Regional Helpline The Regional Helpline will be solely responsible for informing Pathway
will be solely when an outlet closes and reopens and of circumstances affecting the
responsible for closure. It will also be responsible for informing other involved sections
informing... within the regional office of the closure as well as clients and external

customers as appropriate.

The Regional Liaison Manager (RLM) should be informed of all
emergency closures. The appropriate local procedures and
responsibilities will apply.

Outlet information

The Horizon User Guide outlines the responsibilities and actions the
Postmaster should undertake in the event of emergency unplanned
closures.

Recording and Monitoring Unplanned Network
Change Details

Reference is made in these procedures to the local maintaining of closure
records. To ensure this information is consistent the Remedy System will
be used by all regions.

Note : Details of the information which must be recorded are
provided at Appendix B.

6. ALERT PROCEDURES - DELAYED OPENING

Notifying the Region
The Postmaster or RNM must notify the Regional Helpline where cases
of delayed opening and temporary closures of less than one day occur.
The Postmaster should be confident the outlet will re-open during the
same day. The Regional Helpline should note the closure but take no
further action.

Notifying ICL Pathway

Where an outlet has a delayed opening or closure of less than one day
the ICL Pathway Horizon System Helpdesk does not require
notification.

Note : Where a closure of less than one day is anticipated but it
then transpires that the closure will extend to over one
day the Regional Helpline must be informed and the
Horizon System Helpdesk notified during the first day of
closure.

Notifying Customers
The Postmaster is responsible for notifying the customers of:

G1 The reason for the delayed opening and when service is expected to
Open be resumed.

Soon C1 Any extension to the closure period, especially if different benefit

encashment rules will apply.

It is the responsibility of the Postmaster or RNM to notify the Regional
Helpline should the delay be prolonged or if any complications arise
which have an impact on the duration of the closure.

Notifying the Region
The Postmaster or RNM must notify the Regional Helpline in all
instances of emergency closure.

Note: If the Postmaster has informed the RNM of the closure and
not the Regional Helpline the RNM must notify the
Regional Helpline immediately.

The Postmaster or RNM should provide the Regional Helpline with the

following details:

© Outlet name, address and FAD code (7 digit)

0 The reason for the closure and the estimated date and time for re-
opening.

G1 The state of the Horizon kit and cabling. The Postmaster or RNM.
should report if the equipment is either damaged or not secure.

Selecting the alternative nominated outlet
With short term closures it will be necessary to inform the Horizon
System Helpdesk of an alternative nominated outlet. The established
procedures in each Region to select an alternative nominated outlet
should be used.

The Regional Helpline must also notify the Benefits Agency. See the
appropriate section below.

Notifying Customers
The Postmaster or RNM is responsible for notifying the customers of:

1 The reason for the closure and when service is expected to be
resumed.

OG The alternative nominated outlet and the appropriate benefit
encashment rules that apply. These can be found in the Horizon
User Guide.

Payment arrangements for short term closure will remain in force until
either the outlet re-opens or POCL has re-assessed and changed the
closure status and the Horizon System Helpdesk notified accordingly.

Notifying ICL Pathway
The Regional Helpline will be solely responsible for informing the

The Regional Helpline will notify the Horizon System Helpdesk of the
closure by telephone.

This number will be used for notifying ICL Pathway of all outlet
closures, reassessments of closures and when outlets re-open.

The Horizon System Helpdesk will require specific information about
the outlet and conduct a question and answer dialogue. Details required
are:

The Call Reference Number (CRN)

The Horizon System Helpdesk will allocate a Call Reference Number
(CRN) against each closure. The Call Reference Number will be unique.
It will be in the format of E-yymmdd9999 where 9999 is the individual
reference number , i.e. E-9805230001.

The Call Reference Number must be used during all further
communications with the Horizon System Helpdesk regarding that
closure. However when the Regional Helpline notify the Horizon
System Helpdesk of the reopening date a new Call Reference Number
will be allocated against the reopening.

Note: The CRN will be retained should a closure be subsequently
re-assessed from short to long term.

The Regional Helpline will need to record the date, Call Reference

Number(s), outlet details, closure status, and whether the Horizon

equipment is on site or is to be moved off site.

Call Authentication

To ensure closure information passed to the Horizon System Helpdesk
is authorised and from a recognised source an Horizon Call
Authentication Matrix will be used.

ICL Pathway will issue each Regional Helpline with a matrix.

The Horizon System Helpdesk will request selected details from this
matrix during the question and answer dialogue.

The matrix will be used in all telephone communications between the
Regional Helpline and Horizon System Helpdesk regarding the closure
and re-opening of an outlet.

Note : An example of the matrix and how it operates is provided
at Appendix A

ICL Pathway Activities for Short Term closure
The Horizon System Helpdesk will only activate the short term
procedures when notification has been received from the Regional
Helpline.

Activities include:
© Suspension of foreign encashment count
© Cancellation of booked ICL Pathway engineering visits

The Horizon System Helpdesk will notify the Regional Helpline of any
ICL Pathway issues affecting the closure or re-opening of the outlet.

Temporary Removal of Horizon equipment

If Horizon equipment needs to be temporarily removed from the outlet
by Pathway engineers, the RNM should confirm its removal to the
Regional Helpline. The Horizon System Helpdesk will contact the outlet
to confirm an appointment time and date for the engineer.

The Regional Helpline should record all movements of Horizon
equipment on their local records. Due to the timescales involved for
removing and re-installing Horizon equipment it is unlikely this option
will occur with a short term closure.

Oo Business-As-Usual Procedures

The appropriate regional teams should ensure that all relevant business-
as-usual procedures are activated and any other Horizon related
procedures are undertaken.

Short Term Unplanned Closure Procedures

Reassessment of the Closure Status

The duration of many emergency closures will be for a specific time,
...€ reassessment must known at the time of closure, and will fall into either the short or long

be undertaken... term categories.

Should circumstances at the outlet change then the Postmaster or RNM.
must provide an explanation of the new circumstances affecting the
closure and a re-estimation of the intended opening date. The Regional
Helpline must be notified accordingly.

If the circumstances result in the closure period being extended a
reassessment must be undertaken. This will generally be carried out by
the outlets RNM and, where appropriate, the retail line.

Note There needs to be an element of flexibility in some cases,
where a short term unplanned closure may need to be
temporarily extended. The Regional Helpline should liaise
with the Horizon System Helpdesk when these
circumstances occur.

Short term closure to long term closure

The Regional Helpline must always inform the Horizon System
Helpdesk when a reassessment to long term closure occurs to ensure the
correct benefit encashment arrangements are initiated by ICL Pathway.
The Regional Helpline must notify the Horizon System Helpdesk using
the National Horizon System Helpdesk number provided.

See Long Term Unplanned Closure procedure.

In the event of a short term unplanned closure being upgraded to long
term the Postmaster or RNM is responsible for notifying customers.
Any notification must include:

0 The relevant benefit encashment rules.

© Confirmation of the alternative nominated outlet for payment and
collection of re-issued benefit cards.

Re-Opening the Outlet

As soon as it is known when the outlet is due to reopen the Postmaster
or RNM must notify the Regional Helpline of the specific time and date.

Notifying ICL Pathway of the Re-opening

The Regional Helpline will notify the Horizon System Helpdesk by
telephone when the outlet is due to re-open. This will to enable ICL
Pathway to revoke the short-term unplanned procedures for the outlet.

Long Term Unplanned Closure

8. _ ALERT PROCEDURES - LONG TERM UNPLANNED CLOSURE

Notifying the Region

The Postmaster or RNM must notify the Regional Helpline in all
instances of long term unplanned closure.

Note: If the Postmaster has informed the RNM of the closure and
not the Regional Helpline the RNM must notify the
Regional Helpline immediately.

The Postmaster or RNM should provide the Regional Helpline with the

following details:

O Outlet name, address and FAD code (7 digit)

© The reason for the closure and the estimated time and date of re-
opening.

1 The state of the Horizon kit and cabling. The Postmaster or RNM.
should report if the equipment is either damaged or not secure.

Where necessary the Regional Helpline should obtain more
information from the Postmaster or RNM as to the nature of the
problem and in particular confirm the duration of the closure.

If there is doubt over the estimated duration of closure or the status of
the Horizon equipment the RNM should, where possible, be requested
to provide a second opinion.

Where it is not possible to clearly identify when the outlet will re-open, but it could
re-open within a few days, the closure should initially be defined as short term.

(The status can then be revised to long term and Pathway advised accordingly if
this becomes necessary.)

If it is clear a closure will be long term the appropriate procedures should
be initiated immediately.

The Regional Helpline will acknowledge the closure status of the outlet
with the Postmaster or RNM.

Horizon Equipment Risk Assessment

The Regional Helpline will have ascertained from the Postmaster if the
Horizon equipment is secure or is under threat of damage. If itis at risk
ICL Pathway will need to be informed and arrangements made for the
equipment to be temporarily removed. This information will be
included in the telephone notification to the Horizon System Helpdesk.

Selecting the alternative nominated outlet

With long term unplanned closures it will be necessary to direct
customers to an alternative outlet for benefit payment and collection of I
benefit cards. The established procedures in each region to select an
alternative nominated outlet for benefit encashment should be used.

Long Term Unplanned Closure

The selected outlet must be notified of the closure and expected increase
in business volumes. The details of the alternative outlet must be
provided to the Postmaster or RNM of the closed outlet. The Regional
Helpline must also notify both the Horizon System Helpdesk and the
Benefits Agency. See appropriate sections below.

Impact Assessment and Temporary Outlets

Where an outlet is closed for 4 days or more the Retail Network
Manager and the retail line should conduct an impact assessment on the
closure.

In some circumstances it may be decided to provide a temporary mobile
outlet for the duration of the closure. Liaison must be maintained with
the regional team managing the opening of the temporary outlet. The
team managing the opening of the temporary outlet will then activate
the relevant set of Advance procedures.

See Horizon Advance procedures.

Notifying Customers
The Postmaster or RNM is responsible for notifying the customers of:

C1 The reason for the closure and when service is expected to be
resumed.

Go 0 The alternative nominated outlet for payment, the appropriate

benefit encashment rules and the card collection arrangements that
Saneans apply to the long term closure. These can be found in the Horizon
User Guide.

To

Payment arrangements for long term unplanned closure remain in force
until either the office re-opens or the outlet is permanently closed and
the Horizon System Helpdesk is notified accordingly.

Notifying ICL Pathway

The Regional Helpline will be solely responsible for informing the
Horizon System Helpdesk on behalf of the region of any unplanned
outlet closures. It will also liaise where necessary with ICL Pathway for
the duration of a closure and manage the timeliness and accuracy of the
information provided.

The Regional Helpline will notify the Horizon System Helpdesk of the
closure by telephone.

Long Term Unplanned Closure

Reassessment of the Closure Status

With some long term unplanned closures it may not be possible to
establish a clear re-opening date or circumstances may result in the
closure period being extended.

The RNM and the retail line should monitor the closure and where
necessary undertake a reassessment of the closure. Any reassessment
resulting in a change to the forecast re-opening date should be
communicated to the Regional Helpline.

Extension to closure period
The Regional Helpline must always inform the Horizon System
Helpdesk when changes to the forecast re-opening dates occur to

ensure the correct benefit encashment arrangements are maintained by
ICL Pathway.

It is the responsibility of the Postmaster and RNM to contact the
Regional Helpline as soon as it is known that the closure period is to be
extended. The Postmaster or RNM must provide an explanation of the
new circumstances affecting the closure and a re-estimation of the
intended opening date.

Liaison should be maintained with the alternative nominated outlet
whenever a closure period is extended to ensure that the outlet is ready
and able to take on the additional benefit encashment work.

Check Step

Where a re-open date is unknown and the outlet has been closed for 7
days, a ‘check step’ review of the closure will be undertaken. The
Regional Helpline will contact the Horizon System Helpdesk with an
update on the closure and provide the latest estimated re-opening date
for the outlet. The Horizon System Helpdesk will then assess any
Horizon equipment issues.

Should the closure continue the Horizon System Helpdesk must be
informed when any new information is available, until the outlet either
re-openss or closes permanently.

Permanent Closure of an Outlet

Instances will occur where an outlet has been closed for a considerable
length of time and it is decided to close the outlet permanently.

All business-as-usual notifications have to be made together with
confirmation to customers of their alternative nominated outlet for
payment and collection of benefit cards.

The Regional Helpline will notify the Horizon System Helpdesk by
telephone of the intended permanent closure providing the following
details:

General

The Horizon Advance procedures are designed to deliver advance
notification to ICL Pathway of intended network changes and will
enable these changes to take place in the Horizon environment.

These procedures will supplement the business-as-usual procedures
already in operation in each region to deliver network change. Their
purpose is to indicate when and how ICL Pathway need to be informed.

Regional practice often varies firstly in the team that carries out the
activities and secondly in how the change is managed.

The Horizon advance procedures outlined below are mandatory.

A process chart illustrating the main activities for managing Advance
network changes is provided at appendix C

Definitions
Advance procedures are defined as planned changes to the network.
They can be broadly characterised as having:
+ long lead in times
# acomplex series of processes
project management and co-ordination in the region
¢# aneed to remove or install equipment.

Advance procedures cover a specific pre-defined set of change types. A
description and definition of these change types is provided in the
index.

They are distinct from the procedures covering unplanned closures of
outlets.

Closures arising from Alert closures

A permanent closure of an outlet may occur from an unplanned closure.
The original closure of the outlet will be managed by the Alert
procedures.

Once the decision has been made to permanently close the outlet the
management of that closure will be via the advance procedures.

The Regional Helpline will inform the Network Change Authoriser of
the outlet details, including the Call Reference Number. The Call
Reference Number should be noted on the OBC20 form.

New Outlet - Informing the Business Centres
Whenever a new outlet is planned it is imperative that the Headquarters
Business Centre is informed in advance of the details. A new outlet is
defined as a Greenfield site and does not include outlet conversions or
relocations.

This procedure is designed to ensure that the correct range of products
is made available for sale at the new outlet. Whilst the opening of the
new outlet will be initiated and managed by the regions, the products to
be sold at that outlet are decided by the Business Centres.

The Network Change Authoriser must forward a copy of the completed
OBC20 for the new outlet by e-mail to the Head Office Procedure
Management Team. The Change Control Number for the change should
be appended with the suffix N to denote the change is for a new outlet.

The OBC20 should be forwarded to the Procedure Management Team at
the same time as the OBC form is forwarded to Pathway Customer
Service team i.e. a minimum of 8 weeks prior to the target opening date
of the new outlet.

E-Mail Address : “Management Process Team”

The Procedure Management Team will issue a receipt to the Network
Change Authoriser.

Any further liaison between the Regions and Business Centres should
be completed using business-as-usual procedures.

10, MANAGING THE CHANGE

A. ROLES AND DOCUMENTATION
Who is involved?

Initiating Network Change
Advance changes can be initiated from several sources including:

G Teams - who manage business-as-usual, network change. These
include Agency Recruitment, Network Transformation or
Management Services sections, depending on the region. These
teams co-ordinate and ensure delivery of the change.

© RNM’s - changes commonly initiated by an RNM ie. for the
provision of a temporary outlet to service a sports event or the
refurbishment of an outlet etc. Also closures where an unplanned
temporary closure of an outlet becomes permanent, these changes
are linked to the Alert procedures.

See Alert Section of this manual.

Managing Network Change

In addition to the business as usual activities an additional two roles are
required to ensure the change is communicated to ICL Pathway to
enable them to manage all their relevant activities. These roles are:

© The Network Change Authoriser
© Network Change Originator

Both are discussed in the section - ‘Authorisation and Validation of Change
Information’.

Regional Liaison Manager (RLM)

The Regional Liaison Manager should be notified of the proposed.
change. The appropriate local procedures and responsibilities will
apply.

Outlet information
The Horizon User Guide outlines the responsibilities and actions the

Postmaster should undertake in the event of particular planned changes
ie. outlet refurbishment’s.

Types of change information

There are two main categories of information used to inform ICL
Pathway of advance change - primary and secondary. They differ in
when and how the information is communicated to ICL Pathway. They
are defined as:

© Post Office 1998 Version 1.00 - 16 November 1998 10-1

POL00089931
POL00089931

Operational Business Change Horizon Operating Instructions
Advance Procedures -Managing the Change

Primary

© the agreed minimum ‘set’ of information necessary for ICL Pathway to begin
planning their activities associated with the change.

The Network Change Authoriser must ensure that primary information on the
change is assembled.

Examples of primary information are; change type, change control number,
purchase order number (if applicable) , outlet name, outlet address, FAD code,
outlet type and category and number of counter positions.

Primary information is forwarded to ICL Pathway using the Network Change
Advice Form (OBC20).

Secondary
Call the other items of information associated with the change.

The Network Change Authoriser must ensure that secondary information on the
change is assembled. Examples are information ICL Pathway need to assist them
in carrying out their activities e.g. notification of access times to the outlet for ICL
Pathway engineers, contact name(s) at the outlet, changes to target dates.

Once available this information must be forwarded as early as possible to ICL
Pathway using the Network Change Additional Advice Form (OBC21).

Secondary information is variable depending on the type of change.
This information will generally become available throughout the
implementation cycle for the change.

Once secondary information is confirmed and available it should
wherever possible be included on the OBC20 form.

Note: Some changes may not include secondary information, as

they can be fully described using the OBC20 form e.g.
permanent closure of an outlet.

Information required for each Change Type

The Network Change Authoriser will have the responsibility to provide
all the information required on any one particular change to ICL Pathway
Customer Service.

It is vital that all the relevant information on the change is also
supplied, where applicable, to the Reference Data System to fully reflect
the change.

The Data Change Catalogue will indicate which advance changes
require changes to Reference Data.

The Network Change Authoriser will complete and forward the change
information using the OBC22 form and liaise with the Regional
Reference Data Team to ensure all information required has been
captured and entered utilising the regional Reference Data practices.

See section on Change and the Reference Data System.

Authorisation and Validation of Change
Information

1. The Network Change Authoriser (NCA).

To ensure that the change information passed to ICL Pathway is
accurate, complete and timely each region has appointed a Network
Change Authoriser.

The regional staff managing a change, or an RNM, will be the prime
source for providing the required change information to the Network
Change Authoriser. Liaison may be required with other regional
sections who may be responsible for acquiring and delivering specific
items of information.

Responsibilities of the Network Change
Authoriser
The main responsibilities of the Authoriser are:

0 toact as the primary point of contact for ICL Pathway for the
resolution of issues and provide any initial clarification about the
intended network change.

© to assemble, verify and authorise the information gathered on all
advance changes implemented and be responsible for ensuring ICL
Pathway are promptly informed of the intended network changes
using the OBC20 and OBC21 forms.

O To ‘sign-off ’ the OBC20 form for each advance change once all the
associated regional activities for delivering the change have been
actioned.

© to manage the allocation and recording of unique Change Control
Numbers (CCNs) to each advance change and record the change
details locally.

© to be responsible for ensuring that all information on the change, if
applicable, is forwarded to the regional Reference Data Team using
the OBC22 form and undertake final checking prior to live
transmission.

2. The Network Change Originator

An additional and optional role is that of the Network Change
Originator. The principal responsibilities will be to :

G act as anamed contact on the OBC20 form and where necessary,
provide co-ordination and liaison with ICL Pathway engineers and
service suppliers for the day to day management of the change
activities.

C assist in ensuring all information associated with the change, which
may originate from different sections, is co-ordinated and passed to
the Network Change Authoriser at the appropriate time.

Advance Procedures -Managing the Change

© update the Network Change Authoriser of any circumstances which
may affect the delivery of the change (time scale, access times etc.)
and provide an impact assessment of any changed circumstances.
(This may include information received from ICL Pathway Customer
Services)

© advise the Network Change Authoriser when all business-as-usual
and Horizon related activities have been actioned for the particular
change.

The nomination of an Originator for a particular change will be at the
discretion of the region according to the type of change being proposed.
Some advance changes, such as simple refurbishments and closures of
outlets, may not require this role.

The Originator will generally be located in the section most associated
with delivery of the change and will be appropriate where a number of
activities are being co-ordinated with ICL Pathway engineers or service
providers.

Where a particular change is project managed the Originator would.
most likely be in the project team.

Changes to Network Change Authoriser or Originator

The Region must ensure continuity of both these roles in the event of sickness and
absence

Should the details of either change or a new person be appointed their details,
including contact numbers must be provided to ICL Pathway Customer Services.

The Horizon Network Change Advice Documents
(OBC20 and OBC21)

Two forms are used to forward change information to ICL Pathway
Customer OBC Services.

Note: Examples of the OBC20 and OBC21 forms (manual
versions) are provided at appendix D and appendix E
respectively.

The ICL Pathway Network Change Advice Form (OBC20)

associated with the particular change.

O provide a sign-off facility to ICL Pathway for the change.

0 ICL Pathway will not accept notification of or action any planning
for an advance network change without receipt of an authorised
OBC20 form.

Sections 1 and 2 are completed and forwarded to ICL Pathway within
the required notification period for the change. Section 3 is completed

and forwarded to ICL Pathway once all regional activities on the change
have been actioned and any reference data changes have been entered
on the Reference Data System.

Section 3 should be forwarded to ICL Pathway at least 10 working days
before the target implementation date for the change. Due to the time
scales involved for outlet closures only one OBC20 should be forwarded
to ICL Pathway, with section 3 completed.

Should any critical items of information be omitted from the OBC20 i.e.
the CCN, Change Target Date, Authorisers details or Purchase Order
number (if appropriate). ICL Pathway Customer Services will return the
document to the Network Change Authoriser for correction and
resubmission.

Note : Care must be taken in providing clear, accurate and full
information on the OBC20 form. Failure to do so may
delay outlet change activities and implementation.

The ICL Pathway Network Change Additional Advice Form

(OBC21) will

G enable the region to forward any relevant additional information on
the change to ICL Pathway i.e. notification of access dates and times
at the outlet.

© inform ICL Pathway of any confirmed change to the scheduled date
of commencement for the change, as reported on the original OBC20.

The Network Change Authoriser will check for completeness and
accuracy and liaise with the section providing the information in the
event of errors and omissions. FAD codes in particular should be
double-checked.

Allocating a unique Change Control Number (CCN)
To ensure that each network change can be identified and managed
effectively throughout its implementation a change control numbering
system will be used.

The Network Change Authoriser will be solely responsible for managing
the allocation of CCNs. Every advance change must be allocated a
unique CCN. This number must always be recorded on the OBC20,
OBC21 and OBC22 forms and must be referred to in all communications
between POCL and ICL Pathway related to that change.

The CCNs allocated must be recorded locally using the OBC Network
Change Register.

See section ‘Recording Change Information’ below.

The basic CCN is an eight digit number comprising three parts :

© a two digit alpha prefix identifying the region originating the
change.

© a three digit number (1 for the year, 2 for the month) indicating the

date of the request in the format YMM (where Y is the last digit of
the year format)

Recording Change Information - The ‘OBC
Network Change Register’ - OBC23

For audit and management purposes network change information
records must be maintained by the region.

The Network Change Authoriser must ensure that records of the CCN
numbers allocated and associated change details are recorded locally.

The region must use the electronic ‘OBC Network Change Register’
and record the following items of information :

Date, CCN allocated, Outlet Name, Outlet FAD code, Change Type,
Change Target Date, Change Completion Date and Comments.

The comments field must be used to record any significant variation to
the standard procedures or timescales. These will normally occur prior
to the point of installation or de-commissioning of equipment and may

be caused by any of the contractors or parties involved in the change.
Whilst resolution will usually be negotiated between POCL and ICL
Pathway through normal operational business channels, the details
must be noted.

Later, trend analysis of the variations will be used to evaluate change on

must be added to the original document and the new entry clearly dated.
The file must then be resent to ICL Pathway using the same filename.
During the course of a more complex change the file may be forwarded
to ICL Pathway several times.

In emergencies, where an e-mail connection is unavailable, manual
forms should be completed. Where this occurs the forms should be
completed in black ink and capital letters should be used throughout to
ensure greater legibility.

The ICL Pathway Network Change Advice
document - OBC20

The OBC20 form comprises five sections:

Section 1.

Records the basic information about the change type, the unique
Change Control Number, the intended date of commencement of the
change (the target date) and the date forwarded to ICL Pathway.

Section 2.

Records the primary information about the change, including the
outlets details. It also contains the Originator’s and Authoriser’s details.

Section 3.
The Certificate of Change Completion confirms to ICL Pathway that all

activities associated with the change have been actioned, including,
where applicable, reference data.

Section 4.

This section captures the details of the new relocated or converted
outlet and should be completed where appropriate. It largely mirrors
the fields of information required in Section 2.

Section 5.

Any further information on the change not captured in the other
sections can be entered in section 5. This section may contain secondary
information if it is available. This includes information on access times
for ICL Pathway engineers or ICL Pathway service providers when
arranging visits to an outlet.

NoTIFYING ICL PATHWAY

Notification Requirements for ICL Pathway

To ensure that all ICL Pathway Services or ICL Pathway called-off
Services can be scheduled and co-ordinated with the regional business-
as-usual activities, a set of standard notification times have been agreed
for each change type. These are the minimum periods of notification
required by ICL Pathway to undertake delivery of the change.

Where all the necessary information is available on the change, the
OBC20 may be forwarded to ICL Pathway in advance of the minimum
notification periods noted below. This will enable maximum planning
time.

The time scales for notification via the OBC20, the amount of
information and levels of co-ordination required will vary accordingly
for the different change types.

Table 1 below summarises the minimum periods of notification that ICL
Pathway Customer Services require for each change type. Time scales
are expressed in working days before the change target date.

Operational Business Change Horizon Operating Instructions

Advance Procedures -Managing the Change

Note: A ‘simple’ relocation of equipment is one that does not
involve a permanent relocation of the Horizon equipment
within the outlet.

Site Access

As soon as access times for ICL Pathway engineers to attend site are
confirmed by the Postmaster, or RNM, they should be notified to the
ICL Pathway Customer Service team. This should be done using section
5 of the OBC20 form or by the OBC21 form once the information
becomes available.

The region must inform ICL Pathway of the access times at the outlet concerned at
least two weeks (10 working days) prior to the target implementation date. Due to
the time scales involved for outlet closures the access time must be provided on
the OBC20.

Where ICL Pathway request a change to a previously notified and
agreed outlet appointment ICL Pathway Customer Services are
responsible for informing the Network Change Authoriser of the
circumstances and the revised dates. Any such amendments will be
confirmed to the Network Change Authoriser by e-mail using the ICL
Pathway Schedule of Works document.

ICL Pathway Site Visits

ICL Pathway will normally schedule visits directly with the outlet. This
will be done through the Horizon System Helpdesk. All visits will be
scheduled within a minimum of 5 working days prior to the change
implementation date.

All Pathway related work at the outlet, as outlined in the ICL Pathway
Schedule of Works, will be completed within this 5-day period.

Where the change involves the counter area the new counter must be
in place prior to ICL Pathway or ICL Pathway Service suppliers
commencing work at the outlet.

Where circumstances permit and the counter area is prepared ICL
Pathway may undertake work at the outlet earlier, following agreement
with the outlet and regional team managing the change.

In some instances e.g. relocations and refurbishments, access times for ICL
Pathway engineers will be restricted to one or possibly two days and may involve
weekend working. A higher degree of co-ordination between the Region and ICL
Pathway will be required in these circumstances.

Amendments to Scheduled Time Scales

The target implementation date for the change will be initially provided
on the OBC20 form. There will be a number of instances where during
the implementation phase the target date may slip back or possibly be
brought forward.

As soon as any revised date is known and confirmed it must be notified
to ICL Pathway by e-mail using the OBC21 form.

Operational Business Change Horizon Operating Instructions
Advance Procedures -Managing the Change

The circumstances and impact of the changed target date will be
discussed and liaison with ICL Pathway will be required to examine if
the service and change is deliverable.

The Network Change Authoriser must ensure that any re-planned
activities and time scales are notified to all the relevant bodies. The
outlet concerned must be fully informed of any revised time scales.

Cancelling the Change

Where a change is aborted or indefinitely postponed ICL Pathway must
be notified using the OBC21 form, indicating the reason for the
cancellation.

Liaison will be required where ICL Pathway have undertaken any work
in respect of the change.

Deviations from Standard Time scales

Occasions may arise where the standard time scales for notification and
provision of site access times noted at Table 1 are not achievable.

These cover instances where the regional office, and the Network
Change Authoriser, in particular are notified at a very late stage of an
intended Advance change.

Where reduced time scales occur the standard procedure for notifying
the ICL Pathway Customer Services should be employed using the
OBC20. The reason for the deviation to time scale should also be
indicated.

However, due to the reduced period of notification, liaison with ICL
Pathway will be required on a case-by-case basis to examine the
necessary contingency arrangements and examine if the service and
change are deliverable.

Any deviation to a minimum time scale may be subject to a re-quotation
process with ICL Pathway and is likely to cost POCL significantly more
to implement. Deviations from the standard time scales must therefore
be kept to a minimum.

Any re-planned activities and time scales must be notified to all the
relevant bodies as defined in the regional business-as-usual procedures.
The outlet concerned should always be fully informed of any revised
time scales.

Sending the Network Change Information to ICL
Pathway

The Network Change Authoriser will forward the completed OBC20/
OBC21 file , by e-mail to ICL Pathway OBC Customer Services using the
following e-mail post-box :

E-Mail Address : “OBC Network”

fax transmission slip should be attached to the OBC20 or OBC21 form as
confirmation of its receipt by Pathway.

Should the e-mail and fax link be unavailable the OBC20 or OBC21 must
be forwarded to ICL Pathway by post.

Manual OBC20 and OBC21 forms will be available for completion in
emergency when the electronic version cannot be used. Where manual
forms are required page two of the OBC20 should also be forwarded to
ICL Pathway indicating the CCN.

The Network Change Authoriser should notify the appropriate regional
teams involved in managing the change that ICL Pathway has been
formally notified.

The ICL Pathway Customer Service team will notify the Network
Change Authoriser should any change be made to the ICL Pathway
address or fax numbers provided.

A Schedule of Works will not be provided for outlet closures or simple
refurbishments (where there is no counter change involved).

Where appointment times are not included on the original Schedule a
second Schedule of Works will be forwarded providing the details once
they have been confirmed with the outlet.

Whilst recording the services ICL Pathway will call off to deliver the
change the Schedule of Works is indicative i.e. as a result of an outlet
survey work not originally envisaged may be required.

Where critical information is omitted and it cannot be clarified by phone
the Network Change Authoriser will return the Schedule of Works by e-
mail to ICL Pathway for correction and re-submission.

Where an e-mail link is not available the Schedule of Works will be
faxed to the Network Change Authoriser.

On receipt the ICL Pathway Schedule of Works must be filed with all
other associated change documents.

The Network Change Authoriser should in turn notify the regional Helpline of the
intended visit details, as appropriate.

E. GENERAL

Co-ordination of Downstream Activities

The Network Change Authoriser will be responsible for ensuring the
necessary level of liaison is maintained with ICL Pathway throughout
the implementation of the change. There are potentially several main
areas where co-ordinated activities and liaison will be required during
the delivery of an Advance change.

Outlet information

The Horizon User Guide outlines the responsibilities, actions and
timescales for notification the Postmaster should be aware of in the
event of outlet refurbishments.

ICL Pathway Communication with Regional Staff
Where site visits are required ICL Pathway will notify the Network
Change Authoriser using the Schedule of Works document. Further
liaison may be required by telephone to clarify details or minor changes
to visit details.

ICL Pathway Communications with Outlets
Appointment times and dates for ICL Pathway or their Service
Suppliers will be made directly with the outlet by the Horizon System
Helpdesk.

Exceptionally where direct contact with the outlet is not possible or
inappropriate ICL Pathway or their Service Suppliers will arrange visit
details via the Network Change Authoriser.

The Network Change Authoriser should ensure that all appropriate
regional staff and teams are informed of the ICL Pathway visit schedule.
Any standard rules for communicating outlet appointments within the
Regional office should apply.

ICL Pathway Responsibilities

ICL Pathway will be required to deliver the requested network changes
at the required outlets within the agreed time scales and quality
assurances. ICL Pathway responsibilities will include:

Don’t forget
your normal
procedures

Notifying ICL Pathway of Planned Volumes of
Change

Where large volumes of change are being planned or are envisaged by
the Region, Head Office or the Network Change Authoriser should
liaise with the Headquarters Network Team. The latter will in turn liaise
directly with the ICL Pathway Customer Services team where necessary.
An example is a major regional refurbishment program.

Any large-scale Network changes may require special project
management terms to be applied.

Other Regional Change Activities

Anumber of other Horizon related procedures are involved when
managing network change. These procedures will be co-ordinated
within the region to ensure delivery of the change and will need to be
reported to the Network Change Authoriser when actioned. They
include:

Business-as-Usual Procedures

Each region has established procedures in place to manage and deliver
all the types of outlet change covered by the Horizon advance
procedures. In the Horizon environment a number of new activities will
need to be introduced to cover the movement, installation or
decommissioning of Horizon equipment.

All the business-as-usual activities associated with the particular change
should be completed according to the existing regional guidelines.

Should there be any significant issues arise or potential delays the
Network Change Authoriser should be informed, as there may be an
impact on the time scales for delivering the change and the co-
ordination of activities with ICL Pathway.

See Section on ‘Amendments to Scheduled Time scales’.

The regional staff managing the change should be aware when all
activities have been actioned as they will need to update the Network
Change Authoriser.

Selecting the alternative nominated outlet

With a number of planned changes i.e. temporary or permanent
closures, it will be necessary to direct customers to an alternative outlet
for benefit payment and collection of benefit cards. The established
procedures in each region to select an alternative nominated outlet for
benefit encashment should be used.

The selected outlet must be notified of the closure and expected increase
in business volumes. The details of the alternative outlet must be
provided to the Postmaster or RNM of the outlet to be closed.

temporary or permanent a number of additional activities will need
to be undertaken by the Postmaster or RNM at the outlet i.e.
unissued payment cards and PINs will need to be securely stored
until the outlet re-opens.

POCL Provision of Compliant Counter

In instances where new outlets, relocation and conversions are
concerned it is the responsibility of the Postmaster or POCL to ensure
that the counter area is compliant with the necessary specification to
enable the Horizon equipment to be successfully installed.

The outlet counter area and any major modification work such as screen
rebuilds or bespoke joinery must be completed prior to ICL Pathway engineers
or ICL Pathway service suppliers attending site.

The detailed specification required for the counter area is documented in the
‘SPSO 2000 - Screen and Counter Handbook & Planning Guide’.

The regional office should where necessary both advise and ensure that
these standards are made known to the Postmaster.

Related Activities

It will be the responsibility of the regional staff managing these types of
changes and/or the Postmaster to ensure all on site counter preparation
work is completed prior to the ICL Pathway engineers attending the

outlet to install the Horizon equipment.

Any circumstance concerning the preparation of the outlet, in particular
the counter area, which may impact on the time scales for implementing
the change, should be notified to the Network Change Authoriser.

Note: Where the region or Postmaster has arranged for other
contractors to undertake outlet modifications it is the
responsibility of the region to inform ICL Pathway of their
arrangements and work schedule. ICL Pathway will not
negotiate with third parties. This information can be
provided to ICL Pathway using section 5 of the OBC20 or

using the OBC21.

A. PROCEDURE CHANGE PROCESS

Introduction

The introduction to these instructions indicated that there would be a
review process. Proposals to change network procedure documentation
may be generated by regional teams, or from within the network
procedure management team itself.

Operationaly, Area

The network procedure management team will be monitoring business
developments in order to introduce necessary changes to procedure
documentation in good time.

Wee date
procedures

They have a further responsibility to liaise with other automation
projects. The aim of this is to ensure that where common data is
required for several activities, there is one cohesive procedure for
conformant delivery.

‘Obtan authorization
reject or rework

Publish &
ew procedores

The purpose of this procedure is to ensure all procedure documentation

— is amended, agreed and published in a consistent and systematic way.
Recipe ackoedge
receipt fom
“abuter
Procedure
Initiation

On identifying a requirement to change part, or all, of the procedure
documentation an originator will describe the change required. This
will then be transferred to the network procedure management team.

The team will initially validate and assess the impact of the proposed
change. Should the change be deemed necessary the team will create a
draft version of the proposed procedure. In the event of the proposed
change failing the validation exercise or impact assessment, the team.
will inform the originator of the rejection and the reason.

Authorisation

The draft procedure will then be passed to the procedure owner for
concurrence.

The procedure owner will then decide whether to:

C1 Refuse concurrence and totally reject the proposed change.

C1 Refuse the concurrence pending re-work on the proposed change.
C1 Endorse the proposed change.

The network procedure management team will manage any re-work on
the proposed change.

The decision of the procedure owner (refuse, re-work or endorse) will
be communicated to the originator by the network procedure
management team and the reasons for that action.

Revised Procedure Publication

On endorsement of the proposed change the network procedure
management team will update the procedure master files and manage
the publication of them.

The network procedure management team will then manage the
distribution of this new procedure to registered holders.

A transmission note will accompany it and this will be recorded on the
version control database.

Note: An example of the OBC Procedure Revision form (OBC40) is
provided at appendix H.

Recipient action

On receipt of the new procedure and transmission note, procedure
holders will destroy the old version and replace with the new. They will
also complete and comply with transmission note requirements.

On receipt of the completed transmission note the network procedure
management team will record this on the version control database and
file them

B. INCIDENT MANAGEMENT

Introduction

The day to day communications described within the previous sections
of these procedures should resolve the majority of situations that could
become incidents. However, it is expected there will be occasions when
events will interrupt the normal performance of the Operational
Business Change procedures. The underlying cause of the variation
could be due to POCL, ICL Pathway or a third party. This variation will
be termed an ‘Incident’.

Terminology

The following definition has been adapted from service management
guidelines:-

“Incidents are individual day to day faults or failures in
delivering the required changes to hardware it's location
or associated software. They will be raised either by
change implementers or authorisers at an operational
level. They are managed via operational contact or Help
Desk services.”

Incidents may arise at the point of installation or de-commissioning of
equipment by ICL Pathway.

The procedures described below are designed to enable us to deal with
such incidents which may interrupt normal POCL service. They are
designed to fit to existing operational and service management
procedures.

On-site Installation Incidents

This procedure will apply when an agreed schedule of work fails. This
may be due to a failure by an ICL Pathway engineer at the point of, or
during, installation or de-commissioning of equipment. Failures or
faults due to other circumstances will be dealt with by local procedures.

Where circumstances arise affecting the delivery of the service at an
outlet and which concerns the installation or de-commissioning of
equipment, the retail outlet must contact the Horizon System Helpdesk
immediately.

Horizon System Hel
Telephone Numbe

The Horizon System Helpdesk will advise the retail outlet of any actions
to take, record the incident, and issue a unique incident number. This
number must be noted by the retail outlet, and when the call is closed
the date and time recorded.

The NCA is responsible for ensuring that retail outlets are aware that
the Horizon System Helpdesk must be contacted if an ICL Pathway
incident occurs.

Operational Business Change Horizon Operating Instructions
Administration

Incident log
The reporting of an incident to Horizon System Helpdesk will raise an
incident record within the business. ICL Pathway will provide periodic
reports of the incidents recorded to the POCL Service Management
team.

Problem Management

Whilst this is outside the scope of these procedures it should be noted
that unresolved or repeated incidents may result in escalation into
problem management for long term resolution.

A. USING THE HORIZON CALL AUTHENTICATION MATRIX

The following instructions are intended for use by Regional Helpline
staff when contacting the Horizon System Helpdesk to report an
unplanned, emergency closure of an outlet.

Creation and Distribution by ICL Pathway

ICL Pathway are responsible for the creation of the Call Authentication
Matrix and for its distribution to POCL Regional Helplines.

Anew Matrix will be issued by Pathway each month to each Regional
Helpline Manager. Each new Matrix will be effective from the first day
of the month and the outdated matrix should be destroyed. The period.
the matrix is valid for will be indicated.

If a Matrix is compromised a new version will be issued to all Regional
Helplines.

Distribution and Management By Regional
Helplines

The Regional Helpline Manager will be responsible for controlling the
distribution of the Matrix to Helpline staff. It is for each Region to
determine the number of staff operationally who will need to use the
Matrix daily. Photocopies are acceptable but should be kept to an.
absolute minimum.

The Regional Helpline Manager and Helpline staff using the Matrix will
be responsible for the secure storage and confidentiality of its contents.
Any unauthorised disclosure should be reported to the Regional
Helpline Manager.

The Regional Helpline Manager is responsible for reporting to the
Horizon System Helpdesk any compromise of the Matrix. The Regional
Helpline Manager will collect and destroy any copies of the
compromised Matrix.

The Regional Helpline Manager will ensure that adequate security and
confidentiality are maintained.

Use of the Matrix

The Matrix must be used in all communication for reporting unplanned
outlet closures to the Horizon System Helpdesk. This includes initial
notification, any reassessment of the closure and for information
regarding the re-opening the outlet.

The Matrix should only be used when the Helpline staff contacting the
Horizon System Helpdesk has the authorisation from the Region to
request that Pathway change the Service at the outlet(s).

During the Question and Answer dialogue the Horizon System
Helpdesk will prompt for a password response from the Regional
Helpline staff member reporting the closure.

Operational Business Change Horizon Operating Instructions

appendix A

Where an incorrect answer is given one further chance will be provided
after checking that the correct version of the Matrix is currently in use.
Should a further incorrect answer be given the Horizon System
Helpdesk will not pursue the call further, will ask for the callers details
and will escalate the incident. The Regional Helpline Manager will be
informed by the Horizon System Helpdesk of the failure.

Where a breach of security is identified the Region must investigate the
circumstances.

Example of the Call Authentication Matrix

Alpha Bravo Charlie
1 Please Yesterday Driver
2 Friend Paper Luck
3 Shop Easter Test
4 Hotel Pencil Mouse
5 Field Exit Computer

The example Matrix above is a simplified version of the actual Matrix.
The format however will be the same.

The Horizon System Helpdesk operator would prompt for a password
by requesting the word found at Bravo 2. The Regional Helpline
operator would respond ‘Paper’.

Keeping ICL Pathway informed

Should the Regional Helpline Manager permanently change the new
details should be forwarded to the Horizon System Helpline Manager.
