John, I am raising a req for £10k for Fujitsu for the expert witness, therefore we will need to reduce expenditure to cover it,
which we should be able to off-set against the BAU £56k opportunity. I don’t think you'd allocated against this pot, only
the project opportunity, so it should have no impact.

Also can I have sight of the figures from the business cases please when they are done to confirm what we are asking for
so that I can calculate what is left in the pot for other activity.

Cheers

Hi Mark

I hope all is well at your end.

ve chased up our financial and commercial teams today to identify where we are with this PO — I’ve had a few days
off to get my Christmas shopping started! — I’m hoping the appropriate cogs and wheels have been successfully
turning. 1’ll let you know once I get feedback.

This PO allows for £10k; which will provide POL with approximately 8 days of Gareth Jenkin’s time.

’'m attaching correspondence between your legal team and Gareth to keep you abreast of the current litigation
activity; he has so far used one day of the eight provided under this PO. Needless to say, if he is requested to attend

meetings with your legal teams, review Defence Expert’s Reports or to attend Court this vehicle will be very quickly
exhausted. To summarise, he is currently working on:-

POL-0086368
POL00089393
POL00089393

Cornwall!): 214230

Wylie: Winlaton Sub Post Office, 13 Front Street, Winlaton, Bladon on Tyne, NE21 4RF: 394329

Ishaq: Birkenshaw Post Office branch in Bradford: 163306

As we know, instituting a new booking mechanism between our companies takes time; perhaps we should consider
setting the wheels in motion for a replacement to the current PO now to ensure continuity of support. Or perhaps
we could increase the value for the current PO?

Let me know your thoughts.

Kind regards
Penny

Hi Penny

We raised a PO earlier this year (June 23") in preparation for Gareth, but it was not used, therefore we have an open PO
that we can utilise for the current work you are referring to.

If you can use this, please quote n your invoice and send in as normal. Would you let me know the value
of your potential invoice for this work? It has not been mapped against a CT though, because we were trying to ensure
there were no delays at the time.

If not, I can cancel the current order and raise a new one, but it will take time.

Happy to speak to clarify if you wish.

Cheers

Hi Penny
Hope you are well ~ nearly the weekend!

iam a little out of the loop with this now that I have changed roles. I asked Mark about raising an invoice (he has the
budget) to cover the expert witness requirements for one of Sharron’s cases in January which I think the email below
will relate to. Mark has said that back in April an order was raised for £10,200.00 but that we were never invoiced for it?
Do you know anything about that at all? Gareth has been approached directly by an external solicitors and Jayne will
need to start discussions with our team leaders on how we prevent this from happening going forward as it is clearly
unacceptable that he be “ambushed?” in this way.

Can you let Jayne or myself have your thoughts?

Kind Regards

Jane

Rachel,

Can't you use the report I have already sent you? There is no mention of the case on the report.

You should really be addressing such requests through Post Office Ltd rather than directly to myself.

As far as I know there is no commercial cover in place for me to spend any time on such activities (and that includes the
case of Nemesh Patel).

Regards

Dear Gareth

Re: Horizon expert report

As you may already be aware, your expert report detailing the reliability of the Horizon system has
been served as evidence in a number of Post Office cases that are at various stages of the court
process, most of which are listed for trial in the early part of next year.

It should be noted that to date, most, if not all cases raising the Horizon system as an issue, have been
unable/not willing to particularise what specific issues that they may have with the system, and how
that shapes the nature of their defence.

As we already have your detailed report, I would like to serve it in each case listed below. All of the
following cases have raised issues with the reliability of the Horizon system:

1. Jamie Dixon Trial date - TBC

2. Khayyam Ishaq 25th Feb 2013 trial at Bradford Crown Court

3. Angela Sefton & Anne Neild 21st Jan 2013 trial at Liverpool Crown Court
4. Nemesh Patel 14th Jan 2013 trial at Peterborough Crown Court

5. Kim Wylie 17th December 2012 trial at Newcastle Crown Court

6. Grant Allen 10th December 2012 for PCMH at Chester Crown Court

POL-0086368
POL00089393
POL00089393

Your expert report has already been served in the Nemesh Patel case. I would like to serve your
report in the remaining cases and have attached a case summary of each case listed above so that you
may familiarise yourself with the facts of each case.

I would like to stress that I do not anticipate that all of the above cases will reach trial stage. Please
could you read the case summaries attached, and send 5 original signed and dated copies of your
report to me as soon as possible.

Jam conscious that there are a couple of cases coming up in December. In order for me to serve your
report in time, please could you either send the copies of your reports via special delivery and/or as
an email attachment.

If you have any queries please do not hesitate to contact me
Kind regards

Rachael
