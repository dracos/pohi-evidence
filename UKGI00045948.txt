2. Minutes of the previous meeting

The minutes of the meeting of 15 July 2021 were approved.
3. Action log
No matters arising.

4. Risk update

The Board focused on the risks relating to PO!

} In respect of POL,

it was noted that action would be required to secure the retention of the CEO, and that certain
other key senior staff were departing or at risk. Whilst the interim payments to claimant sub-
postmasters are proceeding well, and negotiations with sub-postmasters are generally positive,
this was offset by the very slow progress on the Historic Shortfall Scheme, and the concerning
level of legal fees, which are forecast to exceed £120m. The Board asked for assurances that
the POL team is properly resourced; this was confirmed.

On the POL Inquiry, it was noted that it is running behind schedule, and that ministers would be
updating Parliament shortly on a revised schedule. The CEO will be meeting UKGI’s QC to
discuss the strategy for the Company's approach to the Inquiry; the Board members firmly agreed
it was the duty of the CEO and the Board to agree this strategy, even if this strategy were to
involve acknowledging historic issues in the approach taken by ShEx to governance.
Notwithstanding this, the Board felt it very important to fully support both current and former staff
who will be giving evidence, up to and including the cost of their representation. Engagement
with former staff continues. As a consequence, UKGI’s expected costs are relatively high, at
£1.6m. The Board asked for a detailed legal strategy to come to the next meeting, at which it will
be decided if an ad-hoc Board committee should be formed to oversee UKGI’s response to the
Inquiry.

Action: Legal strategy to be presented to November Board.

Action: Board to decide whether or not to establish a temporary sub-committee to oversee
UKGI's response to the Inquiry.
