Dear Keith
POCL Access TO AUDIT INFORMATION

1 am writing in response to the action placed at the recent Contract
Administration Board meeting to confirm the arrangements we discussed ‘at our
meeting on 29" March.

My record of the actions from the meeting was that you were going to discuss
the matter within POCL and then confirm back to me.if those arrangements
were acceptable, hence my not having written to you sooner, My apologies if
that was not the case.

My record of the tentative agréément we artived at was:

1. ICL Pathway will provide'up to 50 aiidit data extractions per annum for
audit and security investigation purposes, with a maximum of 7 in any
calendar month. The annual target will be measured over a rolling 12 month
period.

.2. Any additional extiactionis will be charged for on the basis that, on average,
each such extraction will take 1.5 man days of senior consultant time (at
£1299 per man day) plus expenses. This will cover all work, including
physical extraction.of tapes at the Data Centre, loading onto machines,
rebuilding the Correspondence server as necessary, searching for data,
extraction and recording onto an appropriate.medium.

3. All requests for extractions will continue to be channeled through ICL
Pathway’s Audit Manager who is now Brian Mooney, as set out in the
Horizon System Audit Manual.
