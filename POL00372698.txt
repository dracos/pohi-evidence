Hi Angela
Please find attached the following:

1. Work stream templates — these indicate the objectives of each of the work streams, the Key Performance
Indicators, what the work stream is trying to change, the deliverables, the work that needs to be done,
stakeholders and dependencies. One has been done with each of the work streams, with the exception of the
Detica one.

2. A3 KPI Map — this plots all of the parts of the work streams into one Programme map. This should hopefully give
us some clarity on what we are trying to deliver as a Programme, and then use that to work with the work
stream owners to quantify which bit they are delivering and what their contribution is.

3. Process maps for the “to-be”. The tabs reflect different stages of the lifecycle. These were the basis of the last
Programme Board but we’ve expanded them to create a process map for the pre-appointment and induction
process, operational support process and the leaver’s process. Pam is still working on her content and this
should be with me tomorrow night. Once I get it across I can get it put into a map.

As discussed, we have had varying degrees of success with engagement so our process has been to do this and get the
input and sign-off from the owners. The next stage is to put all the deliverables into a plan and get them to commit to
some dates.

The general feedback is that they are also struggling with dependencies so I thought it would be useful to use the
session on the 11" December as the time when we confirm who needs what from who and when the key activity will
happen.

I’ve assumed you’ ve got visio but if you haven’t let me know and I'll convert them into word.

Hope this gives you something close to what you need.

Thanks

Gayle
