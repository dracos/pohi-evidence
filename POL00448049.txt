Notice of Subpostmaster’s Contract and Community Subpostmaster’s Contract
Variation

Post Office Ltd will introduce a new Post Office® saving stamp on 16 August 2004. The
introduction by Post Office Ltd of the saving stamp to the list of Post Office® products and
services to be provided in the course of a Post Office® business will require a variation to be
made to the provisions of Section 23 of the Subpostmaster’s Contract, and Section19 of the
Community Subpostmaster’s Contract (which Sections are identical in content).

Therefore, in accordance with Section 1, Paragraph 18 of

(i) the Subpostmaster’s Contract, and

(ii) the Community Subpostmaster’s Contract

(which enable changes to be made to the relevant Contract),

as of 1 August 2004, Section 23 of the Subpostmaster’s Contract, and Section 19 of the
Community Subpostmaster’s Contract, will bevaried as follows:

(a) the following words should be added to the end of Paragraph 1:
“..except in the case of Post Office® saving stamps which may be
accepted for all Post Office® goods and services, and any other goods
and services that the Subpostmaster has, at his/her own discretion,
decided to allow.”; and

(b) the following words should be added to the end of part (i) of Paragraph 2:
“,..except in the case of Post Office® saving stamps and only then where

the Subpostmaster is paying change for a purchase made using the Post
Office® saving stamps and the amount of such change is under £5.00.”

Telephone facilities at sub Post Office® Branches

The Official Branch Telephone Line

1 A Subpostmaster must arrange for the provision of suitable telephone
facilities at his sub Post Office branch to meet the needs of the official business of
Post Office Ltd and the requirements of security. These telephone facilities are
known as “The Official Branch Telephone Line”.

2. Where possible, The Official Branch Telephone Line must be provided by BT
in order that Post Office Ltd may use the line for the Post Office Ltd Asymmetric
Digital Subscriber Line [ADSL] service.

3. Where a BT line is installed the Horizon equipment or any future
replacement for the Horizon equipment or any official Post Office Ltd equipment as
Post Office Ltd may from time to time specify will be connected to the Master Line
Box at the sub Post Office branch and will utilise the Post Office Ltd ADSL service
that runs over The Official Branch Telephone Line.

4. Where it is not possible to install a BT line the Horizon equipment or any
future replacement for the Horizon equipment or any official Post Office Ltd
equipment as Post Office Ltd may from time to time specify will continue to utilise
the ISDN line connected to the sub Post Office branch and/or The Official Branch
Telephone Line.

5. Whether The Official Branch Telephone is provided by BT or by another
telecommunications service provider the operational and security needs of Post
Office Ltd must at all times take precedence in terms of the use made of The Official
Branch Telephone Line. Where these needs conflict with the private use by the
Subpostmaster of The Official Branch Telephone Line, the Subpostmaster must.
cease such private use.

6. Provided that the requirements of paragraphs 1 to 5 above are met:

a) the Subpostmaster may utilise The Official Branch Telephone Line for
private purposes in addition to official Post Office Ltd purposes, and

b) The Subpostmaster may order the addition of extra services for The Official
Branch Telephone Line from the telecommunications service provider of that
line.

In either circumstance it is the responsibility of the Subpostmaster to pay for the
installation and operation of any additional services or use

POL00448049
POL00448049
7. Should the Subpostmaster wish to make use of his rights under paragraph 6
above, he or she must first seek Post Office Ltd’s agreement to any such changes by
contacting the NBSC. Only changes authorised by Post Office Ltd may be
introduced.

8. Any movement of or changes to any of the telephone or other
communications equipment at the sub Post Office branch that are the result of
changes initiated by the Subpostmaster, including but not limited to refurbishment
or re-location of the branch, will be the responsibility of the Subpostmaster. The
Subpostmaster will be responsible for ordering and paying for the movement or
changes from the telecommunication service provider.

9. Post Office Ltd reserves the right to amend and update the requirements of
this section in the future should the operational and security needs of Post Office
Ltd require such a change.

10. I The Subpostmaster agrees to co-operate with Post Office Ltd in relation to
the installation at the sub Post Office branch of any other forms of communications
equipment or data links to be used for the purposes of conducting the official
business of Post Office Ltd.

Provision of the Official Branch Telephone Line
11 The Subpostmaster must provide
(a) a direct exchange line; or

(b) an extension plan installation comprising a portable telephone and
two sockets: one to be installed in the sub-post office and the other in
the Subpostmaster’s bedroom. (This type of installation is only
required where POL considers it is desirable, as a security Measure,
and where the Subpostmaster resides on the premises. However, Post
Office Ltd will not require this type of system to be installed at island
and small rural offices where Post Office Ltd considers that the risk of
criminal attack is clearly negligible).

12. The Subpostmaster’s requirement to provide The Official Branch Telephone
Line may be discharged in the following ways:

12.1 By transferring responsibility for and ownership of the BT line at the
sub Post Office branch to Post Office Ltd. Under this arrangement, Post
Office Ltd becomes responsible to BT for the line rental and for the cost of
official calls made by the Subpostmaster. Private calls made by the
Subpostmaster are his or her responsibility and BT will invoice him or her
directly for such calls. This arrangement is known as “Split Billing”. As Post
Office Ltd pays BT directly for the official use of this line the Subpostmaster
incurs no telephone costs for the provision of The Official Branch Telephone
Line and has no need to reclaim such costs from Post Office Ltd

POL00448049
POL00448049
As BT provides the Official Branch Telephone Line under this option, it meets
the requirements of the Post Office Ltd ADSL service. It is the simplest and
preferred option

Subpostmasters who sign a novation accepting the transfer of the line to
Post Office Ltd are deemed to have accepted this option. Once this option
has been accepted it cannot be reversed. New Subpostmasters who take up
appointment at sub Post Office branches where a previous Subpostmaster
has transferred to Split Billing are required to continue with that
arrangement.

Subpostmasters taking up appointment from 1st April 2005 at sub Post
Office branches where The Official Branch telephone Line is provided by BT
but where previous subpostmasters have not transferred to Split Billing are
required as a condition of such appointment to agree to transfer to Split
Billing by signing the necessary novation form provided by Post Office Ltd at
the time of their appointment.

12.2 By allowing the installation by Post Office Ltd at the sub Post Office
branch of a separate BT line to be used as The Official Branch Telephone
Line. Under this option the Subpostmaster retains whatever private lines and
/or telecommunications facilities he or she wishes, but those facilities are not
used for official purposes. As Post Office Ltd pays BT directly for the official
use of this line the Subpostmaster incurs no telephone costs for the provision
of The Official Branch Telephone Line and has no need to reclaim such costs
from Post Office Ltd.

As BT provides the Official Branch Telephone Line under this option, it meets
the requirements of the Post Office Ltd ADSL service.

New Subpostmasters who take up appointment at sub Post Office branches
where a previous Subpostmaster has adopted this option are required to
continue with this arrangement.

12.3 By the provision of The Official Branch Telephone Line via BT or
another telecommunications service provider in circumstances where the
Subpostmaster retains responsibility for and ownership of the Line. In such
circumstances, the Subpostmaster is billed directly by the service provider for
all costs associated with the line and is entitled to reclaim from Post Office
Ltd the ‘official’ element of those costs in accordance with paragraphs 13 to
19, below.

If the telephone facilities provided under this option do not meet the
specifications required by the Post Office Ltd ADSL service the facilities will
not be acceptable as The Official Branch Telephone Line. In such
circumstances the Subpostmaster must either agree to transfer to option
12.1 or option 12.2 unless Post Office Ltd is unable to offer either of those
options, in which case the existing arrangements would continue. In the

POL00448049
POL00448049
event of transfer to option 12.1 or 12.2. he or she would then lose their
entitlement to reclaim costs related to official rental or calls.

New Subpostmasters who take up appointment at sub Post Office branches
where a previous Subpostmaster has adopted this option are required as a
condition of their appointment to change to option 12.1 or 12.2 upon
appointment unless Post Office Ltd is unable to offer either of those options
in which case they may maintain this arrangement.

Telephone Costs Reimbursement

13. The following applies only to those Subpostmasters who provide The Official
Branch telephone Line in accordance with option 12.3 above

Rental Charges

14. Post Office Ltd on production of a paid quarterly telephone account, will
reimburse the Subpostmaster the rental charges billed by BT including the VAT
element (see paragraph 19) appropriate to the type of telephone facility that Post
Office Ltd has agreed is necessary. Rental charges which exceed the levels so
authorised by Post Office Ltd remain the responsibility of the Subpostmaster.

Call Unit Allowance

15. Each Subpostmaster is given for each telephone account period an allowance
of call units for official purposes, based on the scale of Post Office business
transacted; any part of the allowance not expended in a telephone account period
cannot be carried over to the next. The Subpostmaster is due to pay for all call units
used in excess of this allowance.

16. The standard allowances have been fixed at a level which takes into account
the varying conditions between offices. They also allow a margin for contingencies.

Branch Banding (per annum) Official call
per annum
Up to £12k £5.48
Between £12k and £25k £10.92
Between £25k and £35k £40.32
over £35k £52.92

Supplementary Allowance

17. Mailwork Subpostmaster may claim an additional allowance, in respect of
calls made in connection with his Mailwork responsibilities, providing that the
standard allowance has been expended. A claim, supported by documentary

POL00448049
POL00448049
POL00448049
POL00448049

evidence should be submitted to Post Office Ltd with the telephone account
for the period concerned.
Submission of Telephone Reimbursement Claim

18. The Subpostmaster must submit his paid telephone invoice one a quarterly basis
for reimbursement.

Reimbursement of VAT Charges
19, Post Office Ltd will reimburse the Subpostmaster the charges raised for VAT

at the standard rate, in respect of that part of the total charge related to Post Office
services, i.e. rental, the free call allowance and emergency repairs.

SECTION 17 OF THE SUBPOSTMASTERS’ CONTRACT

SECTION 13 OF THE COMMUNITY SUBPOSTMASTERS’ CONTRACT,
SECTION 13(M) OF THE MODIFIED SUBPOSTMASTERS’ CONTRACT

SUBPOSTMASTERS’ PRIVATE BUSINESS; BETTING AND GAMBLING; LICENSED PREMISES;
BORROWING AND LENDING MONEY; POLITICAL ACTIVITIES; CANVASSING FOR BUSINESS;
EMPLOYMENT IN ROYAL MAIL GROUP PLC OR CIVIL SERVICE.

1. PRIVATE BUSINESS

11 The appointment of a Subpostmaster confers on the individual concerned the right to
transact, and to receive payment for, certain items of business on behalf of Post Office Ltd.
The conditions of the appointment also involve such non-compete restrictions on the
private activities of the Subpostmaster on the premises in which his Post Office® branch is
situated as are fundamental and necessary to ensure the continued viability of Post Office

Ltd’s nationwide network.

1.2. Itisimportant to the future of the Post Office® network that all Subpostmasters support
Post Office® products and services. A Subpostmaster who offers products or services in his
private retail business on the premises in which his Post Office® branch is situated which
compete with Post Office® products and services can reduce the revenue generated by the
Post Office® branch. This revenue is essential to provide a contribution to Post Office Ltd’s
fixed costs of maintaining the Post Office® network. Without this contribution, Post Office
Ltd might not be able to sustain the Post Office® network. It is therefore also in the

interests of all Subpostmasters to support this principle.

13 It is also in the interests of all Subpostmasters that Post Office Ltd is able to seek and
negotiate business opportunities for the whole Post Office® network and that it does not
allow clients or suppliers to enter into arrangements directly with selected Post Office®
branches only to the disadvantage of the rest of the network. This would adversely affect

Post Office Ltd’s ability to maintain the Post Office® network as a whole.

14 Subpostmasters benefit from being part of the Post Office® network. In addition to
payments which Subpostmasters receive from Post Office Ltd, Post Office Ltd invests in
advertising that brings customers into Post Office® branches, it ensures that Post Office®
products meet regulatory requirements and it provides customer and business services such

as helplines to support Subpostmasters.

POL00448049
POL00448049
POL00448049
POL00448049

Accordingly, except as permitted by and in compliance with any waiver granted by Post

Office Ltd in accordance with paragraph 1.11 below, a Subpostmaster must not undertake in

a private capacity, or allow anyone else to undertake on the premises in which his Post

Office® branch is situated, the types of business listed in paragraph 1. 6 of this section 17,

as amended by Post Office Ltd from time to time in accordance with paragraph 1.8 below.

The non-compete restrictions on private business activities on the premises in which the

Post Office® branch is situated are as follows:

(i)

(ii)

(iii)

(iv)

business concerned with the provision of services relating to the collection,
conveyance and/or delivery of letters, parcels and packages (collectively called
“Packets” in this paragraph) including without prejudice to the generality of the
foregoing: the sale of stamps, pre-paid postage labels and stationery with prepaid
postage; the acceptance, retention, sortation, return and redirection of Packets
(including Packets containing mail order or other home shopping goods and other

Packets); and the acceptance of payment for such services;

services for the payment of bills, the collection of payments (including pre-
payments) or the collection of revenue (whether by the sale of stamps or meter
tokens, the charging of budget keys or by other means) in connection with services
for the supply of water, gas, fixed line telephones, electricity, cable or satellite

television, or local authority services;

the sale of National Lottery products;

Banking, Building, Industrial and Provident Society, Friendly Society or Credit Union
business or otherwise making available banking facilities including, without
limitation, cheque-cashing, bureau de change (including the selling and buying back
of currency, on demand and pre-order services), collecting deposits or providing
withdrawal facilities on behalf of deposit-takers whether over-the-counter or
through an automated teller machine (ATM) or providing loans, credit cards or other
forms of credit or credit brokerage services but not including the provision of cash-
back transactions or the provision of basic saving stamp schemes which do not
involve the return of cash to participants in the scheme. For the avoidance of doubt,
a cash-back transaction is the withdrawal of cash via a debit card scheme, from the
account associated with the card used, as part of a transaction for the purchase of

goods or services through the same scheme; and
(v) any financial services business or otherwise making available facilities which may
compete with the financial services activities carried on or to be carried on by
Subpostmasters at any time for or on behalf of Post Office Ltd or through Post
Office® branches or which may compromise the regulatory status of Post Office
Ltd (including for this purpose, its Subpostmasters) in its role as appointed
representative of Post Office Ltd's financial service product providers, including, for
the avoidance of doubt, the promotion of competing financial services but not
including the provision of basic savings stamps schemes which do not involve the

return of cash to participants in the scheme.

For the avoidance of doubt, these non-compete restrictions apply to all methods of
transaction of the areas of business set out above. This includes, without limitation, the use

of smartcards, ATMs and on-line terminals.

The categories of business listed in paragraph 1.6 above constitute the current non-compete
restrictions but Post Office Ltd reserves the right to review these restrictions in the light of
changing business requirements, varying them if necessary. All Subpostmasters will be
given at least 12 months’ notice in writing of any such changes. No restrictions will be
introduced on products or services other than Key Products and Services, as defined in

section 1.9 of this section 17.

Key Products and Services are the core products and services offered by Post Office Ltd. The
Key Products and Services are:

0) Letters, parcels and packages services of any kind and related services;

(ii) Services for the payment of bills, collection of payment or collection of revenue;

(iii) National Lottery products;

(iv) Banking services, including bureau de change;

(wv) Financial services,

(vi) National Savings and Investment products;

(vii) Money transfer services;

(viii) Postal orders;

(ix) Savings stamps;
& Benefits’ distribution and Government services;
(xi) Motor vehicle and driver licensing services and other motorist services;

(xii) Telephony products and services;
(xiii) Travel ticketing and travel passes; and

(xiv) Television licensing services.

Post Office Ltd reserves the right to amend this list of Key Products and Services from time
to time. No new products or services will be introduced to this list which are not current or

future key sources of revenue and/or contribution for Post Office Ltd.

If a Subpostmaster is considering taking up a new private retail business opportunity which
may fall within the scope of the non-compete restrictions specified in paragraph 1.6 above,
he should, before he takes up any such business, inform Post Office Ltd of the circumstances
and seek advice as to whether the work concerned falls within the restrictions described

above.

Subpostmasters may apply for a waiver from the non-compete restrictions in paragraph 1.6
of this section 17. Post Office Ltd’s waiver policy is available on the Post Office Ltd website.
This sets out the circumstances in which a waiver may be granted and the procedures that
must be followed. This policy is subject to amendment by Post Office Ltd from time to time.
If a waiver is granted subject to conditions, a Subpostmaster must comply with these
conditions. A failure to do so will result in the waiver being invalid from the date the

Subpostmaster ceased to comply with the conditions.

ASubpostmaster must not use and must ensure that no third party uses the name “Post
Office” in connection with any of his private business activities (or the private business
activities of a company with which he is associated in any way) or in such a way as to imply
that Post Office Ltd is in any way connected with these activities. Nor may a Subpostmaster
transact any private business in a way that might lead customers to conclude that Post

Office Ltd is in any way connected with that business.

A Subpostmaster must not engage Royal Mail Group employees to undertake any work
whatsoever connected with the Subpostmaster’s private business (or the private business
activities of a company with which he is associated in any way) at any time when they are
employed in Post Office® or Royal Mail Group duties.

BETTING AND GAMBLING; LICENSED PREMISES; BORROWING AND LENDING MONEY

A Subpostmaster and his Assistants must not:

0) bet or gamble by means of post (betting by private telephone off the Post Office®

part of the premises is permissible); or
22

23

24

25

26

(ii) take part in racing etc. pool or competitions or betting at “fixed odds” on football
matches (there is no objection to participation in ordinary football pool

competition).

A Subpostmaster must not on the premises in which the Post Office® branch is situated;

(0) allow or provide for gambling; or
(ii) conduct any business with a turf commission agency or a football or turf pool
agency

Notwithstanding the conditions of Paragraphs 1.6(iii), 1.10 and 2.2 above, a Subpostmaster
and his Assistants may in a private capacity take part in or act as a promoter of such local
lotteries as are permitted under the Lotteries and Amusements Act 1976 (Northern Ireland
in part Ill of the Betting and Lotteries Act (Northern Ireland) 1957). The onus of ensuring
that the law is complied with rests with the person concerned in the promotion and conduct
of the lottery and the sale of tickets. Tickets for such lotteries must not be sold over the Post
Office® branch counter nor must the Post Office® branch be used in any way for
advertising purposes, eg. in giving addresses at which tickets are available, nor must
advertisements include the words Post Office/Post Office®, Sub-Post Office/Sub-Post
Office®, Post Office branch/Post Office® branch or Subpostmaster.

A Post Office® branch may not be situated in premises for which an “on” licence allowing for
the sale of drinks, other than a restaurant, has been granted, unless the premises have been
clearly divided so that Post Office® customers do not need to go through the licensed
premises, There is no objection to the Subpostmaster holding an “off” licence provided the

liquor is sold in closed vessels.

Neither a Subpostmaster nor any company with which he is associated in any way must
borrow from or lend money to any Royal Mail Group employee. Nor shoulda
Subpostmaster or any such company provide security for the benefit of any Royal Mail

Group employee in raising a loan.

The loaning of money by a Subpostmaster or by any company with which he is associated
in any way to persons drawing pensions or allowances on the security or strength of their
Post Office Card Accounts or of expected future payments from the Department of Work

and Pensions is also strictly forbidden.

engaged on Post Office® business or on the Post Office® branch premises;

(ii) he must not exhibit any notice soliciting votes for any particular candidate or with
any party or political object either in the Post Office® branch or on any vehicle
under the control of the Royal Mail Group; and no leaflet or address with a party or

political object may lie or be exhibited within the Post Office® branch.

A Subpostmaster who intends to stand for Parliament must notify Post Office Ltd
accordingly at the earliest opportunity. He must cease to have connection with the running
of the Post Office® branch from the day he is nominated when the branch will be placed “in
charge”. On receipt of the notification Post Office Ltd will inform him of arrangements
whereby he may name a deputy to act as Subpostmaster should he be elected. If he is
elected he will be able to resume office when he ceases to be a Member of Parliament,
provided the break in his service does not exceed 5 years and further provided he has
complied with the arrangements for naming a deputy and the Post Office® branch has not
been closed through normal changes during his absence; should he fail to comply with
these arrangements he will be regarded as having resigned on the day he is elected. If he is

not elected he may resume office after the election result has been declared.

CANVASSING FOR BUSINESS; EMPLOYMENT IN ROYAL MAIL GROUP PLC OR THE CIVIL
SERVICE

A Subpostmaster must not canvass persons, firms or companies who reside or carry on
business at a place nearer to another Post Office® branch, to transact Post Office® business
at his Post Office® branch. Nor must he deliver items of Post Office® business to

customers’ premises.

Neither a Subpostmaster nor any of his Assistants may be employed in Royal Mail Group plc
or the Civil Service if his duties would bring him into contact with the work of the Post
Office® branch.

SECTION 8 (A) OF THE COMMUNITY SUBPOSTMASTERS CONTRACT
SECTION 9 (M) (A) OF THE MODIFIED SUBPOSTMASTERS CONTRACT

RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE SAFEGUARDING OF THE MAIL

1. The Subpostmaster is responsible for the safekeeping of any letter, parcel,
packet or other item transmissible by post which is conveyed, received, sorted,
collected, delivered or otherwise handled in accordance with the provisions of
this Contract (defined hereinafter as a “Postal Packet”) whilst such Postal

INFORMATION/REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

3. The Subpostmaster acknowledges that Post Office Ltd views every incident of
damage to, theft or loss of, or interference with, a Postal Packet as being very
serious in nature. The Subpostmaster must therefore report as soon as possible

SECTION 11 OF THE COMMUNITY SUBPOSTMASTERS CONTRACT
SECTION 10(M) OF THE MODIFIED SUBPOSTMASTERS CONTRACT

ASSISTANTS

INTRODUCTION

Post Office Ltd must comply with certain obligations in relation to the Post Office®
business, including those of: Postcomm, Ofcom and Financial Services Authority
regulations, and money laundering and immigration legislation. Some of these obligations
require Post Office Ltd to ensure that its Subpostmasters (and any persons employed or
engaged by Subpostmasters on Post Office® business) are made aware of, and know how to
comply with, the terms of such regulations and legislation. These requirements have been set
out in this Contract (in particular, but not limited to, this Section and the Section dealing with
Divulgence of Official Information). The obligations placed upon Subpostmasters are the
minimum necessary to ensure that both Post Office Ltd and Subpostmasters are compliant
with the regulations and legislation mentioned above, and are, in the main, what most
Subpostmasters, as responsible employers, should be doing anyway. The objectives of these
obligations are:

to ensure that Post Office Ltd complies with the relevant regulations and legislation,
and

to ensure as far as possible that Subpostmasters do so too, and that no Subpostmaster
suffers from the consequences of failure to so comply. (This is very important, as
those consequences can include criminal prosecution.)

Subpostmasters have a duty to ensure that they are aware and that they make their staff
aware, of the obligations set out in this Contract.

GENERAL

1.

A Subpostmaster must provide, at his own expense, any suitable assistants with the
relevant skills which he may need to carry out the Post Office® work in his sub Post
Office® branch (“Assistants”).

Assistants are employees of the Subpostmaster, and the Subpostmaster will
consequently be held wholly responsible for any failure, on the part of his Assistants,
to:

2.1 apply Post Office® rules or instructions as required by Post Office Ltd;

2.2 complete any training necessary in order to properly provide Post Office®
Services; and

2.3. comply with the obligations set out below.

The Subpostmaster will also be required to make good any deficiency of cash or stock
which may result from his Assistants’ actions or inactions.

Section 15 July 2006_Assistants
41

4.2

43

POL00448049

POL00448049

This Section contains the obligations which the Subpostmaster has to fulfil in relation
to the recruitment and employment of each of his Assistants (which includes any
members of his own family). Where the Subpostmaster fails to comply with any of
these terms, he may be deemed to be in breach of his Contract which will then be
liable to termination. The obligations in this Section are additional to the
Subpostmaster’s responsibility, as the employer of his Assistants, to comply with the
provisions of any legislation and regulations that impose obligations on employers,
providers of postal services and financial services, or sellers of insurance or
communications products.

RECRUITMENT

The Subpostmaster must establish and maintain a recruitment file for each Assistant.
In order to meet its legal obligations regarding monitoring of compliance, Post Office
Ltd will be entitled to inspect such recruitment files from time to time upon giving the
Subpostmaster reasonable written notice that they should be made available for such
inspection. The recruitment file should include, in the format of the Recruitment
Checklist at Appendix 3 to this Section, a comprehensive record of all checks carried
out in relation to the recruitment, selection and employment of any person applying to
him for employment as an Assistant ( defined in this Contract as the “Applicant”).

The Subpostmaster is responsible for carrying out all necessary checks in order to
satisfy himself as to the honesty, integrity and suitability of any Applicant. He must

also take certain steps, as set out below, in order to satisfy himself as to:

. the right to work in the UK;

. the identity and permanent National Insurance number; and.
. the address,
of any Applicant.

Proof of Right to Work in the UK

The following procedures are necessary to meet the requirements of immigration
legislation:

Step 1

The Subpostmaster will need to ask all Applicants to provide documentation that
satisfies the criteria listed at Appendix 2 to this Section.

Step 2

The Subpostmaster must satisfy himself that the Applicant is the rightful holder of
any of the documents he presents.

The Subpostmaster must carry out the following reasonable steps when checking any
documents presented by an Applicant:

Section 15 July 2006_Assistants
44

POL00448049

POL00448049

a) check any photographs, where provided, to ensure that they are consistent
with the appearance of the Applicant;

b) check that the dates of birth listed are consistent with each other and with the
appearance of the Applicant;

©) check that the expiry dates are valid and the documents are still live;

d) check any United Kingdom Government stamps or endorsements to see if the
Applicant is able to do the type of work he is offering;

e) if the Applicant gives you, from List 2 of Appendix 2, two documents that
have different names for the Applicant, you should ask him for a further
document to explain the reason for this. (The further document could be a
marriage certificate, divorce document, deed poll, adoption certificate or
statutory declaration.)

Step 3

The Subpostmaster should make a photocopy of the following parts of all the
documents shown to him for retention in the recruitment file:

a) the front cover and all of the pages which give the Applicant’s personal
details. In particular, the Subpostmaster should copy: (i) the page with the
photograph, and (ii) the page which shows the Applicant’s signature; and

b) any page containing a United Kingdom Government stamp or endorsement
that permits the Applicant to do the type of work the Subpostmaster is
offering.

If it is not possible to make the necessary photocopies at the time, the documents
should be retained, copied at the earliest possible opportunity and returned to the
Applicant.

Step 4

List in the Applicant’s recruitment file all documents seen and copied on steps 1-3
above (e.g. ‘UK Passport — Number 12345678’; or ‘Full birth certificate and a P60
dated 14 April 2005’).

Proof of Permanent National Insurance Number

4.4.1 Unless already provided and photocopied, as part of an Applicant’s
documentation proving his Right to Work in the UK, the Subpostmaster will
need to see a document giving the Applicant’s permanent National Insurance
Number and name. This could be a: P45, P60, National Insurance card, or a
letter from a Government agency.

4.4.2 The Subpostmaster must then list in the Applicant’s recruitment file the
document seen (there is no need to photocopy the document if it is provided
solely for proving the NI number).

4.4.3 For the small number of Applicants who are unable to supply a permanent
National Insurance number, they should be asked to explain why, the reason
should be noted and the Subpostmaster should consider carefully whether to
proceed with the application. Applicants with a genuine reason for being
unable to supply a permanent National Insurance number (such as Applicants

Section 15 July 2006_Assistants

4.10

POL00448049

POL00448049

from outside the UK) should be advised that they would need to obtain one
from the relevant authorities prior to being appointed.

Proof of Address

The Subpostmaster must see at least one of the following items showing the
Applicant’s name and current address:

Driving Licence

Recent Paid Gas or Electricity Bill

Recent Paid Telephone Bill (not mobile)

Recent Paid Council Tax Bill

Recent Paid Water Bill

Recent TV Licence

Recent Bank Statement, must be supported by a credit/debit card

(In relation to the above “Recent” means no more than 3 months old.)

The Subpostmaster must then list in the Applicant’s recruitment file the details of the
document seen (there is no need to photocopy the ‘proof of address’ document).

The Subpostmaster must ensure that all recruitment files for successful Applicants
have been correctly annotated and the associated photocopies have been included to
provide proof of an Applicant’s right to work in the UK. There should be no missing
photocopies, incorrect combinations of documents or incomplete tick lists.

The Subpostmaster must not confirm an Applicant’s appointment until the criteria
have been met and the registration process outlined below has been completed.

It is the Subpostmaster’s responsibility to ascertain that all documentation supplied by
the Applicant satisfies the criteria.

References

At the recruitment stage, the Subpostmaster will need to obtain at least 2 references
(which must be independent of the Applicant and of each other) in respect of the
Applicant.

Work History

The Subpostmaster must obtain a work history from each Applicant for the
immediately preceding 5 years (unless the period in which each Applicant has worked
can be proved to be less than 5 years, in which case the work history of the full period
must be obtained). It is the Subpostmaster’s responsibility to assure himself of the
validity and accuracy of the details provided by the Applicant. (Measures to achieve
this could include questioning at interview, and the seeking of references from
previous employers).

Honesty, Integrity and Suitability

4.11.1 The Subpostmaster must seek information from each Applicant about any
unspent convictions, including conditional discharges, for any offence in a
Court of Law (including a Youth Court or Court Martial) or any caution,

Section 15 July 2006_Assistants
POL00448049
POL00448049

reprimand or warning. The Subpostmaster must also seek information from
each Applicant about any pending criminal proceedings in which the
Applicant might be involved. The Subpostmaster must also seek information
from each Applicant about mis-selling of any product or service or lack of
integrity in any form of employment involving selling.

4.11.2 In order to help prevent the employment of unsuitable or dishonest persons on
Post Office® work, the Subpostmaster must, before the Applicant begins
employment with the Subpostmaster, complete the registration process
detailed at 4.11.3 below (defined in this Contract as the “Registration
Process”). Under no circumstances must the Subpostmaster employ an
Assistant before the Registration Process is completed and the Subpostmaster
has received clearance from Post Office Ltd to employ that Assistant. All
Assistants must be registered, including members of the Subpostmaster’s
family who may only occasionally work in the Post Office® branch. Holiday
reliefs also need to be registered.

4.11.3 The Registration Process

(i) To register an Applicant as an Assistant the Subpostmaster must complete
forms P250 and P13. The text of form P250 is at Appendix 1 to this
Section. The text of form P13 is at Appendix I to the Section dealing with
Divulgence of Official Information. In addition the Applicant must
complete and sign a Security Checks Consent Form. The Subpostmaster
may obtain these forms from Post Office Ltd.

(ii) Form P250. The Subpostmaster must complete and sign Section 1; the
Applicant must complete and sign Section 2. The Subpostmaster must
then submit the completed form to the address indicated on it.

The Subpostmaster must ensure that any details referred to in paragraphs
4.11.1 above and 4.11.5 below about the Applicant (defined in this
Contract as “Relevant Information”) which have come to his attention are
honestly recorded on the form. This will enable Post Office Ltd to
conduct its own checks into the background of the Applicant.

(iii) Security Checks Consent Form. The Applicant must complete this form
in his own handwriting and sign and date it. The Subpostmaster must
check that form is complete and legible and that the personal details
shown on it match those entered on the P250. The completed form should
be sent with the competed P250 to the address shown on the P250.

(iv)Form P13. If the Subpostmaster is satisfied that the identity, character,
history and suitability of any Applicant will not cause him to breach any
of the obligations in this Contract he must require that the Applicant
makes a personal declaration on form P13 prior to commencing work in
the Post Office® branch. Two copies of this form must be completed, one
of which must be kept by the Applicant, and the other should be sent, with
the completed P250 and the completed Security Checks Consent Form, to
the return address on the P250. Both the Subpostmaster and the Applicant
must sign the P13.

Section 15 July 2006_Assistants
4.12

w

5.1

POL00448049

POL00448049

(v) Pre-employment checks will be carried out upon receipt by Post Office
Ltd of the relevant forms, which should be fully and legibly completed.
(These checks can take up to seven working days.)

(vi)The Subpostmaster will then be informed whether or not he may employ
the Applicant as an Assistant.

4.11.4 Where Post Office Ltd has good reason to believe that it would not be in its
best interests for a particular Applicant to be engaged upon Post Office®
business or to have access to any part of the Post Office® branch it will be
entitled to require the Subpostmaster to refrain from employing that Applicant
on Post Office® business if not already employed, or to ensure that the
Applicant is not further employed on Post Office® business if already
employed. If after such a requirement has been reasonably made by Post
Office Ltd the Subpostmaster continues to employ such Applicant he may be
deemed to be in breach of his Contract as referred to in paragraph 3 above.

4.11.5 If details of any offences committed by the Applicant relating to:
(i) the delivery or handling of mail, post or packets; or
(ii) theft or the obtaining of property by deception or fraud; or
(iii) mis-selling of any product or service; or
(iv) lack of integrity in any form of employment involving selling; or
(v) dishonest conduct of any kind,

come to Post Office Ltd’s attention by any means and Post Office Ltd notifies
this fact to the Subpostmaster the Applicant will not until further notice be
eligible to work on Post Office® business or any business concerning Royal
Mail Group plc and the provisions of paragraph 4.11.4 above will apply.

As a general guide no person under 16 years of age should be employed on Post
Office® work, or have access to Postal Packets. However where there is no reasonable
alternative to the part-time employment of an Assistant under 16 years of age, such
employment must be subject to the following conditions:

no person under the age of 14 years may be employed in any capacity;

the Assistant, even if a family member, should be fully registered with Post Office
Ltd in accordance with the provisions of this Section 15; and

the Subpostmaster must comply with all relevent legislation affecting the employment
of young persons and children.

UNSUITABLE PERSONS

During the entire period that an Assistant is employed by the Subpostmaster, the
Subpostmaster will report immediately to Post Office Ltd any Relevant Information
as soon as he becomes aware of same.

Section 15 July 2006_Assistants
52

6.1

6.2

7A

POL00448049

POL00448049

If:

5.2.1 the Subpostmaster does not submit a form P250 prior to the employment by
him of the Applicant; or

5.2.2 the Subpostmaster does not declare on the form P250 any Relevant
Information concerning the Applicant of which he was aware; or

5.2.3. the Applicant fails any checks carried out internally by Post Office Ltd; or

5.2.4 the Subpostmaster does not report to Post Office Ltd as soon as possible any
Relevant Information of which he becomes aware (after submission of a form
P250),

the provisions of paragraph 4.11.4 above will apply.
ONGOING REGISTRATION CHECKS

To meet the needs of regulation and legislation Post Office Ltd must be able to
maintain accurate details of all those who work in Post Office® branches. In addition
to completing forms P250 and P13 when employing new Assistants, the
Subpostmaster is, therefore, required each year to take part in an annual check of
persons employed in Post Office® branches. The current mechanism for this check is
the form P356, which the Subpostmaster is required to fill out and return. This
provides Post Office Ltd with up-to-date details of the people working in a Post
Office® branch and acts as a monitoring check that every Assistant has been cleared
through the pre-employment checking system. It is absolutely essential that the
Subpostmaster cooperates fully with this process or any replacement process that Post
Office Ltd may subsequently and reasonably require.

The details listed on form P356 for each Assistant, which the Subpostmaster will need
to check for accuracy and amend as necessary are as follows:

e Post Office® branch name and address, FAD (or Branch) code
e  Assistant’s name, date of birth and National Insurance number
e Role type, (e.g. Assistant or holiday relief )

e Date employment commenced and, if applicable, date employment ceased and
reason for leaving

e Relationship to Subpostmaster (if applicable)
e Horizon Log On ID
Details must be entered on form P356 for every Assistant employed by the

Subpostmaster, even if he only works occasionally e.g. as a holiday relief.

TRAININ

Post Office Ltd will:

7.1.1 provide the Subpostmaster with relevant training materials and processes to
carry out the required training of his Assistants on the Post Office® Products
and Services;

Section 15 July 2006_Assistants
POL00448049

POL00448049

7.1.2. inform the Subpostmaster as soon as possible where new or revised training
will be necessary as a result of changes in either the law or Post Office®
Products and Services; and

7.1.3. where appropriate (for instance where clause 7.1.2 of this Section applies)
update the training materials (or processes) or provide new training materials
(or processes) to the Subpostmaster.

However, it is the Subpostmaster’s responsibility to ensure the proper deployment
within his Post Office® branch of any materials and processes provided by Post
Office Ltd and to ensure that his Assistants receive all the training which is necessary
in order to be able to properly provide the Post Office® Products and Services and to
perform any other tasks required in connection with the operation of the Post Office®
branch.

7.2 Where Post Office Ltd has obligations to third parties in relation to certain Post
Office® Products and Services (including, but not limited to, financial transactions
(such as bureau de change, and sales of insurance) and communications products, and
provision of mail services), the Subpostmaster undertakes to use his best endeavours
to ensure that his Assistants will not cause Post Office Ltd to be in breach of such
obligations.

73 Post Office Ltd may request from time to time that where it has obligations as
described above the Subpostmaster should conduct specific training (whether through
written/distance learning that may require confirmation of completion or via
presentations) in relation to certain Post Office® Services (such as, but not limited to,
money laundering). Failure by the Subpostmaster to arrange for such training to be
properly applied will be deemed to be a breach of this Contract by him.

7.4 Training Policy

7.4.1 The Subpostmaster must formulate a training policy for all his Assistants, in
order to fulfil his obligations in relation to the safekeeping of any Postal
Packets.

74.2 This training policy should include the following elements:

e the levels of training required to fulfil the obligations referred to above at
TAA;

e the levels of training required according to the differing responsibilities of,

and work undertaken by, the Assistants, in relation to Postal Packets;

details of the minimum level of training required;

an explanation of how the training is provided;

the frequency with which training is provided; and

details of how training is given, recorded and monitored.

7.4.3 The policy must also ensure compliance with all other regulatory and
legislative requirements.

74.4 The Subpostmaster must regularly monitor the implementation of and
compliance with the training policy in his Post Office® branch.

SECURITY

The Subpostmaster must inform each of his Assistants of the seriousness of any
offence of damage or interference to any Postal Packet.

The Subpostmaster must ensure that his Assistants comply with the requirements of
the Operations Manual, Volume 5 and the Security Booklet in general - sub sections
3, 4, and 8 in particular, as they apply to:

e the security of the premises;

e the collection, despatch, conveyance or delivery of mail; and

e the measures to be taken to prevent or detect loss or theft of or damage to a
Postal Packet.

The Subpostmaster must maintain records which can enable him as far as is
reasonably practicable, to identify which of his Assistants was responsible for the
conveyance, receipt, collection, sortation, delivery or handling of any Postal Packet
which may have been interfered with.

The Subpostmaster must carry out regular assessments of the risk to Postal Packets at
the Post Office® branch.

DISCIPLINE

The Subpostmaster is responsible for:

9.1.1 ensuring that each of his Assistants is made aware: (a) that he is responsible
for the safekeeping of Postal Packet whilst such Postal Packets are in his
custody; (b) that he must take all reasonable measures to protect them from
delay, loss, theft, damage and/or interference of any kind, and (c) that failure
by him to follow any security instruction or procedure issued and amended
(where necessary to minimise the risks referred to above) from time to time by
Post Office Ltd will be deemed to be a breach of condition of this Contract by
the Subpostmaster, and Post Office Ltd reserves the right to take appropriate
action in the circumstances; and

9.1.2 placing the obligations set out in 9.1.1 above directly upon every Assistant
whom he employs on Post Office® business.

The Subpostmaster must establish maintain and adhere consistently to a formal
disciplinary policy in respect of any of his Assistants who fails to comply with his
obligations as set out in this Contract. Where the Subpostmaster already has an
established disciplinary policy for his employees it is simply necessary to ensure that
the policy meets the criteria set out in 9.3 and 9.4 below.

The policy referred to in 9.2 above must include at least the following elements:

9.3.1 an explanation of what constitutes a “failure to meet the standards of
conduct”, and the action to be taken in relation to such failure;

9.3.2 adescription of how the Subpostmaster has conveyed to his Assistants:

9.6

10.

10.1

10.2

POL00448049

POL00448049

criminal offence; and
e the action which will be taken in relation to any such failure;

9.3.3 a provision for the appropriate records to be maintained detailing any action
taken against an Assistant for failure to meet a required standard of conduct;
and

9.3.4 an explanation of:

e how the Subpostmaster identifies consistent failures to meet the relevant
standards of conduct; and

e what remedial action the Subpostmaster will take in the event of consistent
failures being made.

The Subpostmaster must regularly review:
© the standards of conduct imposed; and
e the disciplinary policy in place.

The Subpostmaster will keep a formal record of his disciplinary policy and any
exercise by him of it, and Post Office Ltd will be entitled to request sight of such
record from time to time, where it is reasonable to do so in order to ensure that the
Subpostmaster is complying with his obligations in this respect.

Where Post Office Ltd believes, in good faith, that a Subpostmaster has not
implemented the disciplinary policy properly (or at all) against an Assistant, where
circumstances justify such implementation, the provisions of paragraph 3 above will

apply.

INFORMATION/REPORTING

The Subpostmaster must as soon as possible upon becoming aware of its occurrence,
report to Post Office Ltd every incidence of loss or theft of, damage to, or
interference with, a Postal Packet (defined in this Contract as an “Incident”).

The Subpostmaster must also record in respect of each Incident at least the following
details:

e the date, time and place;

e the number of (or, where not known, a reasonable estimate of) Postal Packets
involved;

¢ as far as reasonably practicable, the Assistants who may have participated in
the conveyance, receipt, collection, sortation or delivery of the Postal Packets
involved; and

e any other particulars in relation to it (including the factual circumstances)

SECTION 16 OF THE SUBPOSTMASTERS CONTRACT
SECTION 12 OF THE COMMUNITY SUBPOSTMASTERS CONTRACT
SECTION 12 (M) OF THE MODIFIED SUBPOSTMASTERS CONTRACT

DIVULGENCE OF OFFICIAL INFORMATION, CORRESPONDENCE &
INTERVIEWS

DIVULGENCE OF OFFICIAL INFORMATION

1. The unauthorised disclosure, or use, of any information or document which has
come to the knowledge of a Subpostmaster or sub Post Office® Assistant
through the work of his sub Post Office® branch is forbidden. Any such
disclosure may render the offender liable to prosecution.

2. Neither the Subpostmaster nor his Assistants may disclose any information
regarding Postal Packets except to the person(s) to whom such Postal Packets
are addressed; nor may they make known information that may come to them
directly or indirectly by means of the Post Office® business concerning the
character, standing, or responsibility of individuals or firms, or the private
affairs of any person.

PERSONAL DECLARATIONS

3.1 All new Subpostmasters and newly recruited Assistants are required to sign a
Personal Declaration (form P13 attached as Appendix I to this Section) which
reminds them of the duty of each of Post Office Ltd and the Royal Mail Group
to ensure that all communications and items entrusted to it reach the people for
whom they are intended promptly and safely. The Personal Declaration also
brings to the notice of Subpostmasters and Assistants their obligations under the
Postal Services Act 2000. (An extract from this Act is reproduced at Appendix 2
of this Section).

3.2. Every Subpostmaster and each of his Assistants is on termination of his
appointment required to sign a Declaration (P301) to remind him that the
provisions of the Official Secrets Act continue to apply to him after he has left
in respect of all the information which he has acquired or to which he has had
access by virtue of his position as Subpostmaster or Assistant. (A copy of
form P301 is at Appendix 3 of this Section).

3.3 The Subpostmaster must give each of his Assistants a copy of form P13 and,
upon termination of his appointment form P301, as a reminder of the
importance of the messages they contain. The duty not to disclose
information is imposed by the Act referred to in 3.2 above - not by any
Personal Declarations. Consequently no Subpostmaster or Assistant can avoid
these legal obligations by refusing to sign a form or by attempting to revoke or
disclaim his signature on the form(s).

4. Any request made to the Subpostmaster or his Assistant by the Police or any

other authority, or by a private person, for information which may be
confidential, or may concern matters connected with the duties of another

Section 16 July 2006_Divulgence of official information
POL00448049
POL00448049

Subpostmaster, Franchisee, Operator or an employee of Post Office Ltd or

ple and Post Office Ltd and its services,

and no other person is entitled to comment publicly on such matters. In
particular, untrue, ill-informed or reckless comment will be challenged by Post
Office Ltd (or Royal Mail Group plc, as the case may be). While recognising
the right of any individual to comment publicly on matters of general interest,
each of Royal Mail Group ple and Post Office Ltd expects Subpostmasters and
their Assistants who wish to comment publicly upon matters affecting any
member of the Royal Mail Group to exercise this right in a responsible manner.
Subpostmasters must ensure, when communicating with the press or offering
comment which may be published, or broadcast on radio or television, that their
comments do not go beyond the accepted bounds of propriety and are not likely
to cause embarrassment or to mislead the public. Post Office Ltd should be
asked for advice in cases of doubt.

6. A Subpostmaster wishing to communicate with the public news media should
be guided by the following: -

(a) there must be no unauthorised disclosure of official information
(see above);

(b) views and opinions expressed publicly must not bring Post Office Ltd or any
other Subpostmaster, Franchisee, Operator or Royal Mail Group ple or its
employees into disrepute; and

(c) a Subpostmaster offering unauthorised public comment must make it clear
that he is commenting in his private capacity and not on behalf of Post Office
Ltd or Royal Mail Group ple.

7. A Senior Representative (as defined in the national agreement on facilities for
recognised unions) may wish from time to time to represent the view of the
National Federation of Sub-Postmasters, particularly on matters affecting his
Branch/Committee/Federation. In doing so he must indicate his position as a
Federation spokesman and give his own name.

Section 16 July 2006_Divulgence of official information
8. Particular care is necessary when offering spontaneous comment to press or
broadcasting reporters or interviewers.

PUBLICATION OF OFFICIAL INFORMATION

9. No Subpostmaster may, without the permission of Post Office Ltd, use
information derived from official records or experience for the purpose of
publishing any document, book, play or article, broadcasting on radio or
television, producing or exhibiting a film or photographs, giving a talk or
lecture or taking part in a public discussion.

CORRESPONDENCE WITH THE PUBLIC
10. A Subpostmaster should not, without the permission of Post Office Ltd, write to

or interview members of the public on Post Office® matters other than for the
purpose of correcting an error committed at his own sub Post Office® branch.

OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
11. No Subpostmaster may, without permission, make an official document or a

letter from the public, or any other document which may come into his hands
officially, the subject of legal proceedings.

USE OF OFFICIAL INFORMATION OR POSITION FOR PRIVATE
PURPOSES

12. No Subpostmaster may use his position to further his private interests, or act in

any way which might give rise to the suspicion that he has used, for private
purposes, information available to him in his capacity as Subpostmaster.

to have been a breach of the above rules by anyone employed by him on Post

SECTION 4

ABSENCE ON HOLIDAY - HOLIDAY SUBSTITUTION ALLOWANCE

A Subpostmaster is not entitled to annual leave as such, but subject to the following
conditions he may claim for reimbursement of the necessary cost of his substitution
when taking a holiday. To qualify for reimbursement, the Subpostmaster must be
able to certify that he renders on overage not less than 18 hours personal services each

week.

The reimbursement of the costs of substitution is paid as Holiday Substitution
Allowance and the maxima payable are published annually in Counter News. The
sum reimbursable is the net additional cost necessarily incurred by the
Subpostmaster in providing during his own absence for the Post Office duties which

he normally performs

To assist Subpostmasters to overcome the difficulties sometimes experienced in
obtaining, suitable substitutes in a particular year the holiday substitution allowance
extends over a period of 2 years. The holiday periods for which the costs of

substitution are payable are:-

For a Subpostmaster with less than 10 years service; a total not exceeding 7 weeks in a
period of 24 months beginning 1 April in every odd year; 7 weeks for this purpose

consist of 42 weekdays plus not more than 7 associated Sundays.

For a Subpostmaster with 10 years or more aggregated service; a total not exceeding 8
weeks in a period of 24 months beginning 1 April in every odd year; 8 weeks for this

purpose consists of 48 weekdays plus not more than 8 associated Sundays.

NOTE: Subject to the above limits on holiday periods, Subpostmasters may claim

reimbursement of substitution costs for absences of less than 3 days, provided that

claims are aggregated and made quarterly.

6. Proportionate adjustments will be made to the period for which reimbursement can be
claimed when a Subpostmaster qualifies for the higher allowance during the 2 year

cycle.

7. Subject to the limits in paragraphs 3,4 & 5, a Subpostmaster is free to take up to the
maximum of the period for which he may claim holiday substitution allowance at any
time during the 2 year cycle provided that he makes suitable arrangements for the

conduct of the office during his absence. A further cycle will recur in every odd year.

8. The Subpostmaster must do his best to find his own substitute and make all necessary
arrangements for his absence, which should be notified to the Regional General
Manager on form P2593. In cases of difficulty the Regional General Manager or the
Secretary of the local branch of the National Federation of Sub-Postmasters may be
able to give the names and addresses of local people known to be willing to offer their
services as holiday relief’s to Subpostmasters. Responsibility for concluding

arrangements with such people remains with the Subpostmaster concerned.

CLAIMS FOR REIMBURSEMENT

9. The Subpostmaster must submit a formal claim for reimbursement of the holiday
substitution allowance on forms P2340 and P2340(A) (obtainable from the Regional
General Manager) within three months of the end of the period of substitution to
which the claim relates, except in the cases as in paragraph 10 where claims should be

submitted quarterly. He must certify:-

9.1 that he has taken a holiday both from the Sub Post Office and from his private

business during the whole period covered by the claim; and

9.2 _ that in respect of the services he provided as subpostmaster, he has actually and
necessarily incurred additional expenditure equating to the amount claimed, in
respect of a paid substitute or substitutes, payment will not be made in respect

Claims for refundment of substitution costs for absences of less than 3 days (see Note
at paragraph 5) should be submitted on form P2340 and P2340(A) at the quarter end,
showing the separate dates of absence and the costs of substitution incurred.

In addition to the arrangement quoted above, with effect from January 1990 all claims
for reimbursement of the cost of employing a substitute for periods longer than 2 days
in the event of holiday or sickness, should be submitted for payment to the Regional

Office no later than six months following the date the claim is made.

Where a Subpostmaster is employed by the Post Office either on a full or part-time
basis, e.g. Auxiliary Postman, it is essential, in view of the terms of the certificate
required as a condition of refundment of the cost of his substitution as Subpostmaster,
that he should be absent from all Post Office work during his holiday as

Subpostmaster.

A Subpostmaster who holds more than one sub-office appointment and who satisfies
the general conditions entitling him to claim reimbursement must also satisfy the
further condition that he is absent from all his sub-offices at the same time, i.e.
irrespective of the number of sub-office appointments held, he shall only be entitled to

claim reimbursement for a total period of:-

12.1. not more than 7 weeks in the 24 months beginning 1 April in every odd year, if

he has less than 10 years service;

12.2 not more than 8 weeks in the 24 months beginning 1 April in every odd year, if

he has 10 years or more aggregated service.

Only one claim for reimbursement is admissible and not one claim per office held.

Reimbursement of the cost of annual holiday warranted under the foregoing rules will
be suitable restricted in respect of a Subpostmaster's first and last 2 years of
appointment to amounts proportionate to the actual periods of appointment during

those years; any overpayments which may thus occur will be recovered subsequently.

to 3 occasions in each accounting/ financial year during his own absence on holiday.
On one occasion a cash account may cover up to 3 weeks transactions, and on two.

period. (The accounting periods are shown in front of the cash book).

“Despatch of Accounts” instructions to cover the period concerned will be supplied

by FC4.3/CAG Chesterfield and for Scotland, Scottish Accounting Office AD1.

is signed by a substitute on his behalf, a note to this effect should be made on the

Account.

Office is temporarily closed on account of the absence of the Subpostmaster on jury

service, the scale payment for the period of the closure will be withheld.

Subpostmasters attending for jury service should claim from the court any allowances
for which they are eligible in respect of travelling and subsistence and, where

SECTION 7

SUBPOSTMASTER’S SICK ABSENCE SCHEME - SUBSTITUTION ALLOWANCE

1. A Subpostmaster is not required to give personal service and is not entitled to sick
leave as such. However, subject to certain conditions and limitations described
below, he is entitled to claim sick absence substitution allowance, in respect of the

costs of substitution necessarily incurred, when he is absent from his sub-office

through illness.

CONDITIONS AND LIMITATIONS

2. With the exception of women over 65 and men over 70 years of age, all
Subpostmasters who give 18 hours or more personal service a week, who are absent
from their sub-office through illness, are eligible to claim Sick Absence Substitution
Allowance. The maxima rates payable are published from time to time in Counter
News. The allowance is payable subject to, and in accordance with, the following

conditions:

3. The allowance will be payable when the period of any continuous sick absence
amounts to three weeks (21 days including Sundays) or more and it will be paid

retrospectively for all but the first week (seven days including Sunday) of absence.

4. Payment of the allowance will be limited to an aggregated period of 13 weeks (91 days
including not more than 13 associated Sundays) in any consecutive period of 12

months.

5. Where a Subpostmaster is incapacitated by an accident or illness which results, or is
likely to result, in a continuous absence beyond 13 weeks, Regional General Managers
may authorise payment of the allowance to be extended up to a maximum period of
26 weeks (182 days including not more than 26 associated Sundays) in any one period
of 12 months. Where a Subpostmaster has already received up to 12 weeks of the Sick
Absence Substitution Allowance entitlement in the previous 12 months he may,
because of an absence resulting from an extended illness, be entitled to an allowance

up to a maximum of 26 weeks in any one period of 12 months.

10.

Where a Subpostmaster’s period of reimbursement of sick absence substitution costs
is extended beyond 13 continuous weeks, such extension will be reviewed
periodically. Under no circumstances will a Subpostmaster be allowed to aggregate

separate periods of sick absence beyond 13 weeks in any one period of 12 months.

The maximum allowance payable will be the total amount calculated by applying the
Subpostmaster’s appropriate Holiday Substitution Allowance rate for the period for
which sick absence allowance is payable, or the actual additional costs of substitution

incurred for the same period, whichever is less.

The maximum amount of the allowance for the period of absence for which an
allowance is payable will be abated, where applicable, by the statutory national
insurance sickness benefit or maternity allowance and earnings related supplement
received by the claimant in respect of the same period. Details of these are recorded
on DSS forms BS12 and BF168 which should accompany the Subpostmaster's claim for
the substitution allowance (see paragraph 10). Where however, a Subpostmistress
receives a NHS Maternity Grant, the substitution allowance should not be reduced by

the amount of that grant.

(NOTE: Statutory national insurance sickness benefit means that benefit which is
payable to a person otherwise than in respect of another person who is a child or an
adult dependent.) Where a Subpostmaster is not eligible for DSS benefits, a medical

certificate should accompany the claim for payment of the substitution allowance.

Subpostmasters holding more than one Sub-Office appointment will be entitled to

claim the allowance in respect of only one appointment.

Any Subpostmaster who qualifies for the sick absence substitution allowance and can

produce evidence to show that substitution costs were incurred should submit a claim
to the Regional General Manager after he has been absent for three weeks. Thereafter

he should claim the allowance at the end of each subsequent period of absence of four
weeks (or at the end of the period of absence if that is reached earlier). Claim forms

will be supplied by the Regional General Manager on request.

PERIODS OF SICK ABSENCE OF LESS THAN 3 WEEKS

i.

Where an eligible Subpostmaster as defined above is absent sick for a period of less
than three weeks, and does not qualify for payment of the sick absence substitution
allowance, he will be free to claim, in respect of any substitute for him, Holiday
Substitution Allowance for the period of absence up to the limit of any outstanding
balance of his HSA entitlement. Form P2340 and P2340(A) should be used by
Subpostmasters when making these claims. The amounts payable will not be the
subject to abatement of any national insurance sickness benefit received. Any period
of sick absence for which HSA (as distinct from Sick Absence Substitution Allowance)

is paid will count against HSA entitlement.

SECTION 8

STATUTORY SICK PAY SCHEME

INTRODUCTION

1. Under the terms of the Social Security and Housing Benefits Act 1982 employers are
responsible for statutory sick pay arrangements in respect of their employees. An
employee is interpreted as including office holders who receive emoluments liable for
income tax under Schedule E. Subpostmasters come within this category and
consequently Post Office Counters Ltd is obliged to comply with the conditions of the
Act.

2. The use of the words “employee” and “employer” are used in the context of this
particular piece of legislation and do not in any way alter the Subpostmaster’s status

as an independent contractor.

GENERAL

3. Under the terms of the Scheme most Subpostmasters will not get State sickness benefit
for their first twenty eight weeks of sickness in each tax year. Instead they will get
Statutory Sick Pay, known as SSP, from Post Office Counters Ltd. SSP is paid at a flat
rate. There are 2 weekly rates and eligibility depends on an employee's average
earnings over a specified period. There are no allowances for dependants. SSP is

taxable and subject to NI contributions.

POL00448049
POL00448049

EXCLUSIONS

4. A Subpostmaster will not get statutory sick pay if he comes within one of the
following groups. If a Subpostmaster falls within one of these groups he should still

notify his Regional General Manager about his sickness.

A Subpostmaster reaches the end of his entitlement to SSP from Post Office Counters

when:

(a) Subpostmasters who already had twenty eight weeks of SSP from Post Office
Counters Ltd in a tax year in any one period of incapacity for work (referred to

as PIW)(linked or unlinked);

(b) _ his linked PIW with Post Office Counters Ltd has run for 3 years;

(©) she is pregnant and reaches the “disqualifying period”;

(a) his contract for service ends;

(ec) Subpostmasters who fall sick in a country outside the EEC;

() —_hwis no longer incapable of work, ic. he returns to work or stops sending

certificates of incapacity;

(g) he is taken into legal custody.

QUALIFYING CONDITIONS

5. Statutory Sick Pay can only be paid for qualifying days. It has been agreed with the
National Federation of Sub-Postmasters that qualifying days for Subpostmasters will
be those days they are normally required to provide the services detailed in Section 1
of this contract. Where Subpostmasters are required to give services for only part of
the day, that day will count in full for statutory sick pay purposes. For the majority of
Subpostmasters there will be six qualifying days in each week (Monday to Saturday).
if a Subpostmaster is in doubt about which days are regarded as qualifying days he

should seek confirmation from his Regional General Manager.

27 Issue
September 1994

©Copyright reserved
The entitlement of a Subpostmaster to SSP, rests on 6 qualifying conditions, all of

which must be fulfilled.

(a) The Subpostmaster must have notified his Regional General Manager of his

absence;

(b) Days sickness must be days of incapacity;

(©) The Subpostmaster must provide evidence of incapacity;

(d) Period of incapacity for work (PIW) must be formed and PIW consist of 4 or
more consecutive days, including Saturdays, Sundays and Public Holidays,
when a Subpostmaster is incapacitated for work. It is immaterial for this
purpose whether or not the Subpostmaster would normally have worked on
those days. PIW’s which are separated by 8 weeks (56 calendar days) or less are

linked and count together as a single PIW;

(ce) When a Subpostmaster falls into one or more of the categories listed below he

will be excluded from receiving SSP;

(i) he is excluded from receiving SSP. A Subpostmaster who has been
excluded cannot return to SSP entitlement during the course of a PIW, nor
at the start of a PIW which links with a previous one during which he was

excluded even though he ceases to be a member of an excluded group.

(ii) Over State pension age;

A Subpostmaster who is over State pension age (65 for a man, 60 for a
woman) is excluded from SSP. However, if when a Subpostmaster
reaches State pension age he has a PIW which links with a previous one,

he will be entitled to SSP for as long as his PIW’s continue to link.

SSP as soon as it is known that the total period will be more than 3

calendar months.

Low average earnings;

A Subpostmaster whose average earnings are less than the lower earnings

received, certain State benefits within the 8 weeks period before the first

day of a PIW is not entitled to SSP. The benefits are:

detained, usually arrested and/or in prison. A person who is voluntarily
helping Police with their enquiries is not excluded. A Subpostmaster in
legal custody is not entitled to SSP even if his PIW links with a previous

one when he was not in legal custody.

(f) Days of incapacity to be a qualifying day.

Ifa Subpostmaster becomes incapable of work part way through a day, that day
cannot count as a qualifying day unless he has not commenced work on that
day.

NOTIFICATION OF SICKNESS

A Subpostmaster or his representative must inform his Regional General Manger by
telephone of his incapacity for work on or before his first working day of sickness

irrespective of whether he is entitled to statutory sick pay.

Subpostmasters, including those nominated by limited companies, who hold more
than one appointment, must notify the appropriate Regional General Manager who is
responsible for the collection of primary National Insurance contributions in respect of

his appointments. (See section 10, paragraph 1)

If a Subpostmaster is late in giving notification of sickness, he should advise the
Regional General Manager of the reason for the delay. If the Regional General
Manager is not satisfied with the reason given for the delay, any period of sickness
prior to the date of notification will not count for the purposes of statutory sick pay. If
a Subpostmaster is not satisfied with the Regional General Manager's decision on this
matter he may apply to the Department of Social Security for a ruling. Ifa
Subpostmaster does not qualify for statutory sick pay, he will on notification of

sickness be sent a form SSP1 (E) by his Regional General Manager.

EVIDENCE OF SICKNESS

10.

11.

Subpostmasters must provide Post Office Counters Ltd with evidence of incapacity
for work by means of either a doctor's medical certificate of by a self certificate if the
incapacity is less than eight days. A proforma to be used for self certification can be

obtained from the Regional General Manager.

Subpostmasters must notify their Regional General Manager when they cease to be

sick.

END OF ENTITLEMENT TO STATUTORY SICK PAY

12.

When a Subpostmaster has exhausted his entitlement to statutory sick pay he will be
sent a form SSP1(T), on which, if he is still sick, he can claim state sickness benefit

from the Department of Social Security.

RULES OF PAYMENT

In accordance with the Act, Post Office Counters Ltd is obliged to abate any
remuneration due by the appropriate amount of statutory sick pay. The effect of this
will mean that for the first eight weeks of sickness, remuneration will be paid in full
and that statutory sick pay will be regarded as “notional”. Consequently although
statutory sick pay will be regarded as “notional” the total remuneration paid the
Subpostmaster will continue to attract income tax and National Insurance

contributions in full.

DUAL EMPLOYMENT

i.

If a Subpostmaster who is sick is also employed either by the Post Office (e.g. as an
Auxiliary Postman) or another employer, and provided National Insurance

contributions are paid separately for each employment and all other conditions are
met, he must claim statutory sick pay in respect of both his Subpostmaster services

and other employment(s).

SICK ABSENCE SUBSTITUTION SCHEME

15.

The provisions of this Scheme, which are set out in Section 5, remain except that no
claim will be entertained unless the Regional General Manager has been properly
notified of the Subpostmaster’s sickness. Claims for reimbursement for up to 28
weeks’ sick absence will not be subject to abatement in respect of Statutory Sick Pay.
Claims for reimbursement for a period of sickness which does not attract statutory

sick pay will continue to be subject to abatement.

SECTION 10

NATIONAL INSURANCE

CLASSIFICATION

1. For National Insurance purposes, a Subpostmaster is regarded as an office holder with
emoluments chargeable to Income Tax under Schedule E. As such, all Subpostmasters
are liable to make National Insurance contributions in accordance with the provisions
of Class 1.

Class 1 contributions comprise 2 parts:-

(a) _ the Primary contribution which is generally known as the employee's

contribution;

(b) the Secondary contribution which is generally known as the employer's

contribution.

PERSONS TAKING UP APPOINTMENT AS A SUBPOSTMASTER

2. All persons taking up an appointment as a Subpostmaster should supply the Regional
General Manager with their National Insurance number by means of a NI number
card, form P45 and/or P60 (see leaflet NI217) and also any current certificate of
Earner’s non/reduced rate liability that they have. Where for one reason or another a
new Subpostmaster does not supply a NI number the action outlined in the

Employer's Guide to National Insurance Contributions (NP15) will be followed.

CONTRACTING OUT

Under the Social Security Act 1975, pensions for retirement, widowhood and

invalidity consist of 2 parts:-

(a) basic pension;

(b) and additional pension related to an employee's reckonable earnings between the
lower earnings limit and the upper earnings limit.

4. Anemployer may contract his employees out of that part of the State Scheme which
provides an additional pension if the Occupational Pensions Board is satisfied that his
occupational pensions scheme meets the conditions required by the Act. As
Subpostmasters are not employees of Post Office Counters Ltd they are ineligible to
belong to the Post Office Staff Superannuation Scheme and therefore are not
contracted out of the State Scheme.

CONTRIBUTIONS

5. DSS leaflet NP15 “Employer's Guide to National Insurance Contributions” gives a
guide to the contribution arrangements.

6. Provided that earnings reach or exceed the lower earnings limit, a Subpostmaster will

be liable to pay primary contributions on all earnings up to the upper earnings limit

at

(a) _ the standard rate; or

(b) the reduced rate (see paragraph 8); or

(©) _ is not liable for contributions because he/she is over pension age or has made

other arrangements (see paragraph 9).

7. There is no longer a right to choose to pay reduced rate contributions. However, a
woman entitled to pay at the reduced rate for the 1977-78 tax year continues to be able

to do so for subsequent years unless:

(a) _ she revokes her election;

(b) asa married woman her marriage ends in divorce or annulment;

(©) _ she becomes a widow and after the initial period becomes entitled to widow's

benefit;

(d) during 2 consecutive tax years which fall after 5 April 1978 she was neither

liable to pay a Class 1 contribution nor was self-employed.

DSS will provide a certificate authorising deductions of a Class 1 contributor’s
contribution at the reduced rate. As Post Office Counters Ltd will be held responsible
for any deficiencies in contribution, deductions will be made at the standard rate

unless the Subpostmistress produces a valid certificate.

NON LIABLE SUBPOSTMASTERS

8. No contributions are payable by men over 65 or women over 60 and in such
circumstances DSS will normally issue a certificate of age contribution. However, if
some other definite evidence is being held to show that a Subpostmaster has reached
age 65 (60 for a woman) his/her deductions may be ceased even though a certificate of

age exception has not been produced.

9. The Secondary contribution (see paragraph 2) is due at the same rate regardless of the

Subpostmaster’s rate of contribution or even where he is non liable.

Regional General Manager and for its maintenance. On installation the screen

will become the property of the Subpostmaster.

decides to be necessary and for which it is prepared to pay.

RESITING OF POST OFFICE SECURITY EQUIPMENT

7. Where any agreed re-arrangement of the sub-office accommodation and/or fittings -
see paragraph 4 - involves the moving of Post Office security equipment the

SUBPOSTMASTER
(a) Subpostmaster wishes to improve Post Office NIL

accommodation and Regional General Manager

agrees improvement is desirable.

POL00448049
POL00448049

(b) Subpostmaster has no alternative but to move his NIL
premises or alter them to meet requirements beyond

his control.

(c) Subpostmaster wishes to re-arrange his private 50%
accommodation, which will neither increase nor
improve the Post Office accommodation, but will

require security equipment to be moved.

(d) Subpostmaster wishes to re-arrange his private 80%
accommodation, which will reduce Post Office
accommodation, though not to a level unacceptable
to the Regional General Manager, but security

equipment will need to be moved.

The above scale is intended as a rough guide only and Regional General Managers
have discretion to fix the level of contribution according to the circumstances of each

particular case,

RESIDENCE

A Subpostmaster who does not reside on the premises must satisfy his Regional
General Manger that he has made proper provision for the safety of Post Office
Counters cash and stock entrusted to his care. If residential accommodation is
associated with the sub-office the Subpostmaster must inform the Regional General
Manager if he does not occupy it himself, or if he ceases to do so, and must

immediately inform the Regional General Manager if at any time it becomes vacant.

MAILWORK OFFICES

9.

10.

At Mailwork sub-offices where Post Office employees work on the premises, the

Subpostmaster will in addition be required to provide at his own expense:-

Access to lavatory facilities;

Facilities for washing, including a supply of hot water, e.g. a kettle of hot water where

running hot water is not available;

Hat and coat pegs;

Facilities for making tea, if required;

Adequate lighting and ventilation;

Adequate heating in winter.

The Subpostmaster as occupier of the premises, is required to provide most of the
above facilities under the provisions of the Offices, Shops and Railways Act 1963. It is
likely that the presence of postmen on the premises will require the Subpostmaster, as
occupier, to comply with other provisions of this Act. In addition duties are laid
down in Sections 3 and 4 of the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974, as regards
persons not in his employment. Bearing in mind that the responsibility is his, it is in
the Subpostmaster’s best interest to be aware of the various requirements of these

Acts.

ADVERTISEMENTS

11.

A tile, which might suggest that Post Office Counters Ltd is concerned in the
management of the Subpostmaster’s private business, such as “Post Office Stores”,

must not be used.

SECTION 15

ASSISTANTS

GENERAL

A Subpostmaster must provide, at his own expense, any assistance which he may

need to carry out the work in his sub-office.

Assistants are employees of the Subpostmaster. A Subpostmaster will be held wholly
responsible for any failure, on the part of his Assistants, to apply Post Office rules, or
to provide a proper standard of service to the public. He will also be required to
make good any deficiency, of cash or stock, which may result from his assistants’

actions.

ASSISTANTS’ CONDITIONS OF SERVICE

AGE

Wages, hours, holidays etc., are a matter to be settled between Subpostmaster and the
assistants concerned. However, they should be no less favourable than those enjoyed
by shop assistants generally in the same district. Post Office Counters Ltd reserves

the right to intervene if such conditions are considered inequitable.

The Subpostmaster is responsible, as employer of his assistants, for complying with

the provisions of any legislation which imposes obligations on employers.

Asa general guide no person under 16 years of age should be employed on Sub-Office

work, or have access Lo mails, unless however there is no reasonable alternative to the _

part-time employment of an Assistant under 16 years of age.

SUITABILITY OF APPLICANTS - REFERENCES

6. Inthe light of the Subpostmaster’s responsibilities, set out in paragraph 2 above, he is
strongly recommended to satisfy himself of the character and suitability of an
applicant for employment as an Assistant before a firm offer of employment is made.

Generally the Subpostmaster should:-

(a) _ obtain proof of the identity of the applicant, e.g. birth or marriage certificate,

unless the applicant is known;

(b) seek information form the applicant about any conviction or finding of guilt for
any offence in a Court of Law (including Juvenile Court or Court Martial). In
this connection the Subpostmaster should be aware of the Rehabilitation of

Offenders Act 1974 which restricts the information that needs be given;

(©) enquire whether the applicant has ever been employed by the Post Office,
worked for another Subpostmaster or held sub-office appointment. If the
former then details of such employment should be entered on form P250 (see
paragraph 8) and a reference waited from the Regional General Manager. If
previously the applicant has worked at another Sub-Post Office, including as a
Subpostmaster, details should be given on form P250 and a reference in respect

of that employment sought from the Subpostmaster concerned;

(d) obtain references from all previous employers or schools attended over the last
3 years or from the last employer where the applicant has been employed

during the whole of that period.

7. When seeking references the Subpostmaster is advised to enquire if the applicant had
found to be completely trustworthy and ask the reason for his leaving that
employment. In some instances a Subpostmaster might have to employ an Assistant
before the procedures suggested above are completed. Bearing in mind the
complexities of current employment legislation a Subpostmaster in such a situation is
recommended to offer initially only short term employment pending receipt of
satisfactory references etc.

8. The Subpostmaster must notify the Regional General Manager of his intention to
employ a new Assistant on Post Office Counters Ltd work or when an Assistant

ceases to be employed in the sub-office.

PERSONAL DECLARATION

Before any person (including a member of the Subpostmaster’s family) is allowed to
have access to mails or to perform, either temporarily or permanently, any Post Office
work, he/she must make a personal declaration on form P13 (see section 16, appendix

2.

The declaration of the Subpostmaster’s Assistants and of any members of his family
who perform Post Office duties should be signed in the Subpostmaster’s presence in
circumstances which will help to fix the occasion and the declaration in the memory of
the signatory. The declaration should be made with proper deliberation and the
Subpostmaster should stress its importance and witness the signature. A signed and
witnessed copy of the form should be given to the signatory at the time and he should

be advised to preserve it carefully.

Forms P13 can be obtained from the Regional General Manager as required and must

be returned to him when signed.

SUB-OFFICE ASSISTANT ACCUSED OR SUSPECTED OF DISHONESTY ETC.

10.

11.

In cases where an Assistant is accused or suspected of dishonesty or any other offence
such as wilfully delaying postal packets, the Subpostmaster must report the
particulars to the Regional General Manager as soon as possible and await
instructions. If the report is made by telephone it must be confirmed in writing as a

matter of urgency.

In cases where a person employed by the Subpostmaster is guilty of misappropriating
Post Office Counters Ltd money, any sum which may be tendered by, or on behalf of,
the offender may be accepted but a receipt must be given showing that the money is
held pending possible investigation and without prejudice to any action that Post
Office Counters Ltd may be advised to take. The Subpostmaster should be careful not
to take any action which may be liable to prejudice the question of legal proceedings.

A copy of any receipt must be kept for reference.

UNSUITABLE PERSONS

12.

In order to help prevent the employment of unsuitable or dishonest persons on Post
Office work, a Subpostmaster must notify the Regional General Manager if he
dismisses an employee on these grounds, or if his enquiries about an applicant for
employment give him reason to believe that the applicant is an unsuitable person.
Brief particulars of the evidence should be forwarded to the Regional General
Manager who will decide what steps should be taken to prevent the applicant

obtaining employment elsewhere in the Post Office or at another sub-office.

13. Where Post Office Counters Ltd has good reason to believe that it would not be in its
best interests for a particular person to have access to Post Office Counters Ltd cash
and stock as a Sub-Office Assistant it may call upon the Subpostmaster to:

(a) refrain from offering that person a post if not already employed;

(6) ensure that the person is not further employed on Post Office business if employed.

OUTDOOR POSTAL WORK

14. For any outdoor postal work required, provision is made either by the employment of

staff in the direct employ of the Post Office or by a special allowance to the

Subpostmaster for the engagement of casual labour.

SECTION 16

DIVULGENCE OF OFFICIAL INFORMATION, CORRESPONDENCE & INTERVIEWS

DIVULGENCE OF OFFICIAL INFORMATION

1. The unauthorised disclosure, or use directly, of any information or document which
has come to the knowledge of a Subpostmaster or Sub-Office Assistant through the
work of his Sub-Office is forbidden. Any such disclosure may render the offender
liable to prosecution under Post Office legislation or the Official Secrets Act (see
paragraph 3)

2.  Subpostmasters and their employees must not disclose any information regarding
postal packets passing through the post except to the person(s) to whom such packets
are addressed; nor may they make known information that may come to them
officially concerning the character, standing, or responsibility of individuals or firms,

or the private affairs of any person.

PERSONAL DECLARATIONS

3. (a)_ All Subpostmasters on taking up appointment and newly recruited Sub-Office
Assistants are required to sign a Personal Declaration (form P13) which reminds
them of the duty of the Post Office to ensure that all communications and items
entrusted to it reach the people for whom they are intended promptly and
safely, and that the information in them reaches no one not entitled to it. The
Person Declaration also brings to the notice of newly appointed Subpostmasters
and Sub-Office Assistants on taking up employment their obligations under the
Official Secrets Acts and various Post Office and Telegraph Acts. Extracts from
these Acts are reproduced at Appendices 1 and 3. A copy of form P13 is at
Appendix 2.

(b) A Subpostmaster on termination of his appointment is required to sign a
Declaration (P301) as a reminder that the provisions of the Official Secrets Acts
continue to apply to him after he has left in respect of all the information which
he has acquired or to which he has had access by virtue of his appointed
position as Subpostmaster. A copy of form P301 is at Appendix 3.

65 Issue

POL00448049

(c)  Subpostmasters and Sub-Office Assistants are given a copy of their P13 and
Subpostmasters on termination of their appointment, additionally of form P301
for retention as a reminder of their importance and of the message they contain.
The duty not to disclose information is imposed by the relevant Acts, not by the
Personal Declarations. Consequently no Subpostmaster or Sub-Office Assistant
can avoid these legal obligations by refusing to sign form P13 (also for
Subpostmasters form P301) or attempting to revoke or disclaim his signature on

the form(s).

4. Any request made by the Police or any other authority or by a private person for
information which may be confidential, or may concern matters connected with the
duties of another Subpostmaster or a Post Office employee, or with regard to the
address of a person who resides, in the neighbourhood should be referred

immediately to the Regional General Manager.

CONTACT WITH THE PUBLIC NEWS MEDIA

5. The Post Office has a duty to safeguard its own interests and those of its employees
and sub-office personnel in relation to material which is published in the news media.
The Public Relations Department of the Post Office is primarily responsible for
deciding whether the Post Office should enter into public correspondence and for
ensuring fair and accurate presentation of facts about the Post Office and its services;
comment by other persons is undesirable and in particular, untrue, ill-informed or
reckless comment will not be allowed to go unchallenged. While recognising the right
of any individual to comment publicly on matters of general interest therefore, the
Post Office expects Subpostmasters and their employees who wish to comment upon
matters affecting the Post Office to exercise those right in a responsible manner.
Subpostmasters must ensure, when communicating with the press or offering
comment which may be broadcast on radio or television, that their comments do not
go beyond the accepted bounds of propriety and are not likely to cause
embarrassment or to mislead the public. The Regional General Manager should be

asked to advise in cases of doubt.

©Copyright reserved
POL00448049
POL00448049

6. A Subpostmaster wishing to communicate with the public news media should be

guided by the following:-

(a) _ there must be no unauthorised disclosure of official information (see paragraph

V);

(b) views and opinions expressed publicly must not bring the Post Office or its

employees or any other Subpostmaster into disrepute;

(c) a Subpostmaster offering unauthorised public comment must make it clear that

he is commenting in his private capacity and not on behalf of the Post Office.

7. A Senior Representative (as defined in the national agreement on facilities for
recognised unions) may wish from time to time to represent the view of the National
Federation of Sub-Postmasters, particularly on matters affecting his
Branch/Committee/Federation. In doing so he must indicate his position as a

Federation spokesman and give his own name.

8. Particular care is necessary when offering spontaneous comment to press or

broadcasting reporters or interviewers.

PUBLICATION OF OFFICIAL INFORMATION

9. No Subpostmaster may, without the Regional General Manager's permission, use
information derived from official records or experience for the purpose of publishing
any document, book, play or article, broadcasting on radio or television, producing or
exhibiting a film or photographs, giving a talk or lecture or taking part in a public

discussion.

CORRESPONDENCE WITH THE PUBLIC

10. A Subpostmaster should not, without the permission of the Regional General
Manager, write to or interview members of the public on Post Office matters other

than for the purpose of correcting an error committed at his own sub-office.

OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

T1. No Subpostmaster may, without permission, make an official document or a letter
from the public, or any other document which may come into his hands officially, the

subject of legal proceedings.

USE OF OFFICIAL INFORMATION OR POSITION FOR PRIVATE PURPOSES

12. No Subpostmaster may use his position to further his private interests, or act in any
way which might give rise to the suspicion that he has used, for private purposes,

information available to him in his capacity as Subpostmaster.

BREACHES TO BE REPORTED

13. A Subpostmaster must report to the Regional General Manager any case in which
there appears to have been a breach of the above rules by anyone employed by him on

PERSONAL DECLARATION (P13)

To be made by all persons on entering employment in the Post Office.

DUTY OF THE POST
OFFICE

NON-DISCLOSURE
OF OFFICIAL
INFORMATION

The first duty of the Post Office is to ensure that letters, parcels,
and all other communications or items entrusted to it reach the
people for whom they are intended promptly and safely, and
that the information in them reaches no one not entitled to it.

To help the Post Office to render this essential service to the
community, the Law makes certain provisions of which the more
important are stated overleaf. It is important for you to know
and understand those provisions, not only for your own sake,
but also in order that you should not, through any fault or
omission on your part, enable or tempt others to break them.

It is illegal to disclose official information without authority. A
person engaged in Post Office work must not disclose any
information which he/she obtains as a result of that work, unless
he/she has written permission to do so.

You shall neither during you employment with the Post Office
nor for a period of 1 year after that employment ceases, disclose
to any other person, firm, or company, or publish or broadcast or
use for your own benefit any confidential information relating in
any way to the activities, operations or business methods of the
Post Office, except as previously authorised in writing by the
Post Office.

YOU SHOULD READ CAREFULLY THIS STATEMENT AND THE ONE OVERLEAF

SAFETY OF
POSTAL PACKET

SECRECY

It is an offence to STEAL, SECRETE or DESTROY a letter, parcel
or any other postal packet in course of transmission by post, and
heavy penalties, including terms of imprisonment are provided
for such offences.

It is also an offence to OPEN or DELAY (without proper
authority) a letter, parcel or any other postal packet in course of
transmission by post, and penalties of fine or imprisonment are
provided for such offences.

CARELESSNESS, NEGLIGENCE or other mis-conduct which
endangers the safety of a mailbag or postal packet is likewise a
punishable offence.

Under the Official Secrets Act 1989, it is an offence of a
Government contractor (including an employee of a Government
Contractor) to make a damaging disclosure relating to security or
intelligence. A damaging disclosure may relate to defence,
international relations or information received in confidence
from another state or international organisation, or which results
or is likely to result in the commission of offences, or which is of
information which relates to or was obtained by special
investigation powers. It is also an offence for Government
contractors (and their employees) to fail to safeguard or
improperly to retain or provide access to documents or articles
containing information which it would be an offence under the
Act to disclose. A Government contractor means any person or
body who is employed in the provision of goods or services for
the Crown.

When a person transfers from one post to another, he must
surrender all documents connected with the post he is leaving,
except those issued to him for his personal retention. When he
leaves the Post Office all official documents must be given up,
with the exception of those which he has been authorised to
retain.

All the above conditions apply to all persons with access to any
official information, not only while the access continues, but also
after it ceases, and by termination of employment.

Any person who handles information about identifiable living
people which is processed automatically (e.g. on a computer or
word processor) may also commit an offence under the Data
Protection Act, 1984, if he/she improperly obtains, holds or
discloses any such information, of if he/she improperly transfers
it outside the United Kingdom.

2. that information which I have acquired owing to my official position may be

information which is covered in Sections 1-8 of the Official Secrets Act 1989.

For a period of one year after my appointment with the Post Office ceases I shall not disclose

to any other person, firm or company, or publish or broadcast or use for my own benefit

any confidential information relating in any way to the activities, operations or business

methods of the Post Office, except as previously authorised in writing by the Post Office.

Thereby declare that I have surrendered any document made or acquired by me owing to

my official position save such as I have written Post Office authority to retain.

POLITICAL ACTIVITIES

“PRIVATE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES”

The appointment of a Subpostmaster confers on the individual concerned the right to
transact, and to receive payment for, certain items of business of behalf of Post Office
Counters Ltd at the premises specified. The conditions of the appointment also
involve such restrictions on the private activities of the Subpostmaster as are
necessary to ensure the continued viability of Post Office Counters nation-wide

network.

It is, therefore, in the interests of all Subpostmasters that Post Office Counters Ltd
should be able to seek, negotiate and manage retail business in the market place
without the risk that it will find any Subpostmaster competing against it for the same
business, and accordingly a Subpostmaster must not undertake in a private capacity
any business, or allow anyone else to undertake on the premises in which a sub-office
is situated, business of the kind which Post Office Counters Ltd requires him to

provide for itself or its clients.

The current restrictions on private business activities on the premises in which the

sub-post office is situated are as follows:

i, collection of payments, or sale of prepayment meter tokens on behalf of any

public utility - water, gas, telephone or electricity company;

ii, collection of payment, on behalf of cable or satellite television companies,
collection of revenue whether by sale of stamps or other means on behalf of

local authorities;

iii, sale of “unbooked’ travel tickets or passes on behalf of any transport company

or local authority;

v. commercial change giving service;

vi. phone card sales on behalf of BT, Mercury or any future phone card operator
with whom POCL obtains or seeks to obtain a contract for the sale of such

cards;

vii, business concerned with the provision of services relating to the conveyance of
letters, parcels and other postal packets (“collectively called postal packets” in
this paragraph) including without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing
the sale of stamps, the acceptance of postal packets for conveyance and delivery
and the acceptance of payment for services relating to the collection, conveyance

and delivery of Postal Packets;
viii. provisions of private box and poste restante facilities;
ix. _ business which is connected with the acceptance or delivery of parcels;
x. collection/ delivery or return of undeliverable packets and parcels;
xi. Banking, Building, Provident or Friendly Society business.

The above categories of business constitute the current restrictions but Post Office
Counters Ltd reserves the right to review these restrictions in the light of changing
Business requirements, varying them if necessary. All Subpostmasters will be

informed of any such changes.

If an opportunity for new business occurs to a Subpostmaster, or if a Subpostmaster
receives any communication from a third party which amounts, or may amount, to an
offer to the Subpostmaster to undertake the work, which come within the current
restrictions specified in paragraph 3 above the Subpostmaster should not accept such
work. Instead he should, at once, inform Post Office Counters Ltd of the
circumstances and seek advice as to whether the work concerned falls within the

restrictions described above.

such local lotteries as are permitted under the Lotteries and Amusements Act 1976
(Northern Ireland in part III of the Betting and Lotteries Act (Northern Ireland) 1957).
The onus of ensuring that the law is complied with rests with the person concerned in
the promotion and conducting of the lottery and the sale of tickets, Tickets for such
lotteries must not be sold over the sub-office counter nor must the Post Office be used
in any way for advertising purposes, e.g. in giving addresses at which tickets are
available, nor must advertisements include the words Post Office, Sub-Post Office or
Subpostmaster.

LICENSED PREMISES

A sub-office may not be situated in premises for which an “on” licence allowing for
the sale of drinks, other than a restaurant, has been granted, unless the premises have
been clearly divided so that Post Office customers do not need to go through the
licensed premises. There is no objection to the Subpostmaster holding and “off”

licence provided the liquor is sold in closed vessels.

when he ceases to be a Member of Parliament, provided he has complied with the
arrangements for naming a deputy and the sub-office has not been closed through
normal changes during his absence; should he fail to comply with these arrangements
he will be regarded as having resigned on the day he is elected. If he is not elected he
may resume office after the election result has been declared. A Subpostmaster who is

provided the break in his service does not exceed 5 years.

SECTION 18

NON-OBSERVANCE OF RULES: APPEALS PROCEDURE

ALLEGATIONS OF NON-COMPLIANCE OR NON-OBSERVANCE OF RULES

Although there may be instances where civil or criminal proceedings are
contemplated in which it would serve no useful purpose to call for a written
explanation, in all other instances, and without prejudice to any subsequent
proceedings, any Subpostmaster will be afforded an opportunity of giving a written
explanation of allegations of non-compliance or non-observance of the rules which are

made against him.

At the discretion of the Retail Network Manager which will not normally be withheld,
the Subpostmaster may, if he wishes, meet the Retail Network Manager to discuss the
allegations. he may be accompanied by a friend while doing so. The friend must be
aged 18 or over and cannot be someone involved in the enquiry. The friend must be a
Subpostmaster, sub-office Assistant or Post Office employee - and can be the local

NFSP representative.

As repeated breaches of the rules, even if minor in themselves, may lead to the
determination, without further warning or appeal, of the contract by means of the
giving of three months notice, it is strongly recommended that Subpostmasters take
the opportunity to make such written and verbal explanations of their actions at the
time of the alleged breach of rules. A record will be kept by the Retail Network
Manager of any such discussions and of any written warnings issued to the

Subpostmaster.

REPRESENTATIONS ON POST OFFICE MATTERS

Without prejudice to the above a Subpostmaster may address at any time the Regional
General Manager and representation he may wish to make having reference to his
duties, remuneration or any other Post Office matter. The decision of the Regional

General Manager as to his response to such representations is final.

APPEALS

5. If the Subpostmaster wishes to appeal against a decision to summarily terminate his
contract for services, he may do so either in writing or by personal interview and will
be allowed ten (10) working days from the date of the termination letter to make
application, to a member of the Post Office Counters Ltd “Appeals Authority” whose
decision will be final. There is no formal appeal against three months notice of
contract termination or against termination with pay in lieu of notice. Appeals on all
other issues (e.g. recovery of losses caused by the Subpostmasters negligence) are

heard by the Regional General Manager whose decision is final.

APPROACHES TO PERSONS OUTSIDE THE POST OFFICE

6. Until the Subpostmaster has exercised his final right of appeal, he should not ask
persons outside the Post Office to take up the case on his behalf although this does not
prevent a Subpostmaster from obtaining such advice and support from the NFSP or
any other outside person as may help him to present his case effectively. The
Subpostmaster should not detain Post Office papers or allow them out of his custody
for the purpose of such consultation without the permission of the Retail Network

Manager.

SECTION 19

OFFENCES: SUSPENSION: ENQUIRIES BY OFFICERS OF THE INVESTIGATION

DIVISION

Dishonesty is viewed most seriously and any Subpostmaster or Sub-Office Assistant
believed to have carried, or taken part in, an act of dishonesty against Post Office
Counters Ltd may be prosecuted. Furthermore, any Subpostmaster so involved
renders himself liable to summary termination of his contract. The case of an
Assistant Post Office Counters Ltd may recommend to the Subpostmaster that the

Assistant should no longer remain in his employ on Post Office Counters business.

ARRESTS AND CONVICTIONS

2.

A Subpostmaster must report to his Regional General Manager if he is arrested and
refused bail, or if he is convicted by a Court of any criminal offence (except a traffic

offence for which the penalty has not included imprisonment).

IMMORALITY AND OTHER MATTERS OF PERSONAL CONDUCT

It is the aim and practice of Post Office Counters Ltd to maintain, to the maximum
extent compatible with needs of service to the public, an attitude of non-interference
in the private lives of Subpostmasters. However, where facts come to light calculated
to cause public scandal or grave embarrassment to the Post Office in connection with
a Subpostmaster’s private conduct, the question of his fitness for retention in office

may have to be considered.

SUSPENSION FROM OFFICE

4.

A Subpostmaster may be suspended from office at any time if that course is
considered desirable in the interest of Post Office Counters Ltd in consequence of his:
(a) being arrested, (b) having civil or criminal proceedings brought or made against
him, (c) where irregularities or misconduct at the office(s) where he holds
appointment(s) have been established to the satisfaction of Post Office Counters Ltd,

or are admitted, or are suspected and are being investigated.

83 Issue
September 1994

©Copyright reserved

POL00448049
POL00448049
Where a Subpostmaster is suspended his remuneration in respect of any period of

suspension will be withheld so long as such suspension continues.

On the termination of the period of suspension whether by termination of contract or
reinstatement, the Subpostmaster’s remuneration in respect of the period may, after
consideration of the whole of the circumstances of the case, be forfeited wholly or in
part. If remuneration is paid any rent or other expenses which may have been paid to
him in respect of the continued use of his premises for Post Office purposes during the

period of suspension will be deducted.

CRIMINAL CONDUCT: REPORTING

%

If a Subpostmaster has knowledge or suspicion of dishonesty or other criminal
conduct affecting the Post Office on the part of any person including a Sub-Office
Assistant or a Post Office employee he must, if there is any apparent need for
immediate action, at once tell the Regional General Manager confidentially of his

knowledge or suspicion.

INDUCEMENT TO ACT CONTRARY TO RULES

If any person should try to induce a Subpostmaster or a member of his staff to act
contrary to the rules (if, for example, he should be asked to datestamp covers
irregularly with a view to either himself or the offender afterwards enclosing therein
betting slips or other communications relating to the result of some race, game or
sport) he should, while avoiding compliance (save in the case described in paragraph
9, also avoid putting that person upon his guard by definite refusal). The
Subpostmaster should as soon as possible tell the Regional General Manager what has
happened giving a full report and description of the person so that an immediate

report can be made to POID and instructions sought.

A Subpostmaster or Sub-Office Assistant who is asked irregularly to put in course of
post for despatch or delivery from his own office a cover already date-stamped,
addressed to a betting agent, and presumably already containing a betting slip or
other communication respecting the result of some race, game or sport, should accept
it and with it any bribe offered for compliance. He should at once initial the cover and
hand it and the bribe to the Regional General Manager, to whom he should report as

provided in the last sentence of paragraph 8.

THEFTS BY STRANGERS

10. A Subpostmaster or Sub-Office Assistant who sees a theft of Post Office Property
committed by a stranger should inform the Police of the facts and then report the

matter to his Regional General Manager as soon as possible.

FAILURE TO REPORT DISHONESTY

11. Inline with any employee of the Post Office a Subpostmaster or Sub-Office Assistant
is expected to report immediately any suspicion of dishonesty or criminal intent
which may in any way affect the Post Office, whether the likely offender be connected
with the Post Office or not. He is similarly enjoined to render all possible assistance to

officers of the Investigation Division (see below).

ENQUIRIES BY OFFICERS OF THE POST OFFICE INVESTIGATION DIVISION

12. The main job of the Investigation Division is to investigate, or help the Police to
investigate, criminal offences against the Post Office, British Telecommunications and
the Department of National Savings. the Investigation Division does NOT enquire

into matters where crime is not suspected.

13. Most of the crimes dealt with by the Investigation Division are committed by
outsiders. If follows that a common reason for Investigation Division officers seeking
interviews with persons employed on Post Office business is to get help in clearing up
such offences. Usually the help takes the form of a witness statement that provides
evidence about a particular act or acts that the witness has carried out in the course of

his or her duty.

POL00448049
POL00448049

Although they comprise the minority of all Investigation Division crime
investigations, there are many cases where the possibility (or even direct suspicion)
arises that persons employed on Post Office business may be involved. Officers of the
Investigation Division conduct interviews about these suspected offences and they are
required to observe the same code of conduct when obtaining evidence as that laid
down for Police Officers. This provides for an officer investigating a criminal offence
to question any person, whether suspected or not, from whom he thinks that useful
information may be obtained. As soon as the Investigation Division officer has
evidence which would afford reasonable ground for suspecting that a person has
committed an offence, he must caution him before asking any questions about that
offence. The caution must be in terms which make it clear that the suspected person is
not obliged to say anything unless he wishes to do so and that what he says will be

put into writing and given in evidence.

If a Subpostmaster or Sub-Office Assistant is questioned as a suspected person by an
officer of the Investigation Division, on statements made by a third person, and
expresses a desire to be confronted by that person, such confrontation will, if
practicable, be arranged. At the confrontation, the suspect will be at liberty to
question the third person on his evidence and the questions and replies will be

recorded by the Investigation Division officer.

FRIENDS AT INVESTIGATION INTERVIEWS

16.

At all interviews between Investigation Division Officers and a Subpostmaster or Sub-
Office Assistant, the interviewing officer will first introduce himself, explain the
nature of the enquiry, the ask the person to be interviewed if he wishes to have a
friend present. The introduction and explanation are necessary first steps so the
person to be interviewed knows what is involved when he makes his free personal

choice whether to ask for a friend to be present at the interview or not.

86 Issue
September 1994

©Copyright reserved
17.

18.

19.

A friend invited to attend an Investigation Division interview must be aged 18 or over
and cannot be someone involved in the inquiry. The friend must be a Subpostmaster,
Sub-Office Assistant or Post Office employee - and can be the local NFSP
representative. To avoid unreasonable delay and to ensure that interviews will not
commence until a friend, if requested, is present, the person being interviewed will be
asked to nominate alternative friends if the one first (or subsequently) chosen is not
available or may be involved in the enquiry.

Ifa person being interviewed declines to have a friend present when asked but
changes his mind later, he may ask for a friend to be called at that stage. If he is not
questioned as a suspected person at the outset (i.e. not under caution), but fresh
evidence emerges during the interview which gives reasonable grounds for suspicion,
the Investigation Division officer will make this clear and explain that he proposes to
continue his questions after caution. Before the caution is given the Investigation
Division officer will ask if the presence of a friend is desired during the remainder of

the interview.

A friend may only attend and listen to questions and answers. He must not interrupt
in any way, either by word or signal; if he does interrupt he will be required to leave
at once and the interview will proceed without him. Whatever is said at the interview
is to be treated as in strictest confidence. The friend may take notes of the interview
but he must keep the notes in the strictest confidence. The only communication the
friend is entitled to make on behalf of the person who has been questioned will be in
the form of a written “in strictest confidence” statement which may be submitted by
the latter, in support of any official appeal which the person questioned may desire to
make in connection with the methods followed at the enquiry. No other
communication about the interview is allowed (unless made by permission of the Post
Office) as it might constitute a breach of the Official Secrets Acts. The questioned
officer may, however, if he so desires, communicate the friend’s statement to the

National Federation of Sub-Postmasters in strictest confidence.

SEARCHES

20.

21.

Ifa person agrees to his property or house being searched by Investigation Division
staff the Investigation Division officer will ask, before the search is carried out, if he

wishes to have a friend present.

Investigation Division officers have no authority to search a Subpostmaster or Sub-
Office Assistant or their homes unless the have first obtained the agreement of the
person concerned or they have obtained a warrant to do so. In practice Investigation
Division officers only seek authority or permission to search when it is deemed
absolutely necessary or in the interests of the person involved (e.g. as a pointer to their
innocence). If search by consent is carried out during the course of enquiries which
do not substantiate any suspicion that may have been directed at a Subpostmaster or
Sub-Office Assistant, he will be handed at a later stage a written apology for any
inconvenience caused, coupled with a statement that he readily agreed to the search

and that nothing which would cast any doubt on his honesty was found.

SECTION 20

INFECTIOUS (INCLUDING CONTAGIOUS) DISEASES

1.

Subpostmasters, are expected to act on the advice given by their general practitioners
or hospital specialists, and to refrain from providing “Personal Service”, by taking
leave of absence, through sickness if advised to do so. This is both for their own good

and that of others.

Contact with a person suffering from such a disease will only rarely exempt a
Subpostmaster from providing Post Office services, nevertheless the advice in Par. 1

may apply if the medical practitioner so advises.

“Open cases” of Pulmonary tuberculosis must receive clearance from the Post Office,

before a Subpostmaster will be allowed to resume the provision of “Personal Service”.

If the local Public Health Department should require the temporary closing of the
office, the Regional General Manager will issue instructions as to the stock, etc. In
such cases the question of continuing payment of the subpostmaster’s emoluments
subject to a deduction in respect of any saving in expenses, will be considered on its

merits.

These conditions apply equally to any assistants employed by a subpostmaster on
Post Office duties. Also, in such cases the question of meeting any loss sustained by
the Subpostmaster or Sub-Office Assistant in consequence of the latters enforced
absence will be considered on its merits. It should, however, be understood that the
object of any payment that may be made by Post Office Counters Ltd in these cases is
to prevent there being any inducement to the sub-office Assistant to come on duty
when his presence would be a source of danger to the public or the Post Office
employees with whom they might come in contact in his Post Office work. Post Office

Counter recognises no other obligation in the matter.

TELEPHONE FACILITIES AT SCALE PAYMENT SUB-POST OFFICES

PROVISION OF TELEPHONE FACILITIES

1. A Subpostmaster must, in connection with official business of Post Office Counter
Ltd, and in the interests of security, arrange for the provision of telephone facilities at

his sub-post office. The following facilities are required by Post Office Counters Ltd:-

(a) a direct exchange line; or

(b) _ anextension plan installation comprising a portable telephone and two sockets:
one to be installed in the sub-post office and the other in the Subpostmaster’s
bedroom. (This type of installation is only required where the Regional General
Manager considers it is desirable, as a security measure, and where the
Subpostmaster resides on the premises. However, Post Office Counters Ltd will
not require this type of system to be installed at island and small rural offices
where the Regional General Manager considers that the risk of criminal attack is

clearly negligible).

REIMBURSEMENT OF INSTALLATIONS COSTS

2. Post Office Counters Ltd will reimburse the Subpostmaster for costs incurred in the
installation of the required telephone facility provided that excessive expenditure is
not involved. However in the event that the Subpostmaster decides to have installed
a system other than that required by Post Office Counters Ltd the Post Office
contribution to the total installation costs will be no greater than the cost of installing
the facilities outlined in paragraph 1 above. If a Subpostmaster is required to make
provision for an extension plan system as described in paragraph 1(b) and chooses to
have an extension socket in a room other than his bedroom the Post Office
contribution to the installation cost will be no greater than would be incurred in

respect of the installation of a direct exchange line.

RENTAL CHARGES

3. Post Office Counters Ltd on production of a paid quarterly telephone account, will
reimburse the Subpostmaster the rental charges billed by BT including the VAT
element (see paragraph 10) appropriate to the type of telephone facility that the
Regional General Manager has agreed is necessary (see paragraph 1). Rental charges
which exceed the levels so authorised by the District Manger remain the responsibility

of the Subpostmaster.

CALL UNIT ALLOWANCE

4. Each Subpostmaster is given for each telephone account period an allowance of call
unils for official purposes, based on the scale of Post Office business transacted; any
part of the allowance not expended in a telephone account period cannot be carried
over to the next. The Subpostmaster is due to pay for all call units used in excess of

this allowance.

5. The standard allowances have been fixed at a level which takes into account the

varying conditions between offices. They also allow a margin for contingencies.

6. The scale of allowances, related to the telephone account period, is as follows; the call
unit allowance in column (b) is intended to reimburse Subpostmasters for longer
distance calls to DNS, Girobank etc., where these are not covered by the basic

allowance in column (a):

Offices in unit bands: Official call units Additional call

7. Where calls from a sub-post office to the Regional or Controlling Crown Office are not
within a local call area and are charged on the basis of the distance between two
points, the standard allowance of official call units (paragraph 6, column (a)) will be

subject to the following multipliers:

SUPPLEMENTARY ALLOWANCE

8. A Mailwork Subpostmaster may claim an additional allowance, in respect of calls
made in connection with his Mailwork responsibilities, providing that the standard
allowance has been expended. A claim, supported by documentary evidence should
be submitted to the Regional General Manager with the telephone account for the

period concerned.

EMERGENCY REPAIRS.

9. Some British Telecom General Managers are prepared to provide emergency repair

facilities for Subpostmasters. The service allows for attention to faults reported:-
(a) I Monday-Friday between 1700 and 0800 hours;

(b) Saturday up to 0800 and from 1300 hours;

(©) all day on Sunday, Public and Bank Holidays.

All other times repair facilities apply. Subpostmasters will be billed for use of the

emergency service on the normal quarterly bill and Regional General Mangers will

reimburse these costs on presentation of the bill.

SECTION 22

QUALITY STANDARDS

1. Post Office Counters Ltd, through its network of post offices, aims to give customers
and clients a high quality service. The Subpostmaster must therefore give high
priority to serving customers quickly and efficiently, and to fulfilling the
documentation requirements of clients with accuracy and professionalism. Also the
Subpostmaster will participate in “Putting the Customer First” by attending the
training sessions which form the programme and carrying out the interim activity

required between sessions.

The interim activity consist of commitment to display the Customer Charter in the
public area of the sub post office, and to hand out questionnaires inviting customer
feedback. On an ongoing basis questionnaires will be handed out at regular intervals,
to be determined by POCL, but not more than once every six months. In addition to
the issue of questionnaires Subpostmasters, particularly those in larger offices, will be
encouraged to measure customer service as described below. Subpostmaster’s sub-
office assistants are also expected to undergo the “Putting the Customer First”
programme, either at sessions led by the Subpostmasters themselves, once they are
trained, or the retail network manager. Subpostmasters should make all reasonable

efforts to encourage their staff to participate in the training.

Payment for attendance at the four “off site” sessions, led by retail network managers,

within the “Putting the Customer First” programme, will be for travel and

substitution.
WAITING TIME
2. The Subpostmaster should ensure that the time for which customers wait to be served

is kept to the minimum, and make any adjustments to the staffing pattern accordingly.
To help achieve this objective Subpostmasters in offices displaying, the charter,
particularly those in larger offices, will be encouraged to monitor waiting times using

the system developed by POCL.

serving, three times a day and to supply the information to POCL to enable the

results to be analysed and fed back to the Subpostmaster.

While POCL has an overall national objective for customers to wait for no longer than
five minutes before being served, it is recognised that customers have different needs
and expectations of waiting time in different offices, and at different times of the day
or week. However, Regional General Managers will treat very seriously any evidence
which suggests that the Subpostmaster is not making all reasonable efforts to ensure

that customer waiting time is minimised, to meet the needs of customers locally.

TRANSACTIONS

3. The Subpostmaster will be responsible for ensuring that transactions are carried out
accurately, that all reasonable steps are taken to prevent fraud and that all
documentation is properly completed and despatched at the due time. Where under
the terms of its contracts with its clients Post Office Counters Ltd incurs financial
penalties as a result of the Subpostmaster’s failure in this regard, Post Office Counters
Ltd may pass on this additional cost to the Subpostmaster. The Appendix to this
Section sets out the current maxima of the penalties which can be passed on to the
Subpostmaster. In such circumstances, Post Office Counters Ltd will furnish copies of
the appropriate documents as evidence in support of any action. Failure to properly
complete accounting and traffic information documents may lead to the exclusion in

whole or in part of business transacted for the purposes of determining payment.

4. The Subpostmaster will ensure that customers are treated fairly, courteously and
helpfully. Persistent failure to meet the high standard of service demanded by Post

Office Counters Ltd could result in termination of contract.

REDEMPTION OF TELEPHONE, TELEVISION, MOTOR VEHICLE AND OTHER
SAVINGS STAMPS

1. A Subpostmaster must only accept savings stamps either in total or part payment for

the relevant transaction to which they refer.

2. Ibis TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE for a Subpostmaster (or anybody acting on his
behalf) to:-

(i) exchange redeemed savings stamps for cash;

(ii) affix savings stamps to savings cards and claim them as if they had been

redeemed by a customer in the normal course;

(iii) convert total of partial cash or cheque payments for licence or accounts
payments into stamps and claim them as if they had been presented by a

customer;

(iv) convert official cash (whether directly from the till or paid in over the counter)
into savings stamps (whether affixed to a card or not) for use as a means of
saving for any purpose whatsoever; or to take action which improperly sets out

to increase his remuneration.

3. Redeemed savings stamps must be despatched immediately following completion of
the cash account on which the transaction to which they refer takes place. It is not
acceptable to remit redeemed savings stamps later than the scheduled despatch date

or to remit several weeks redemption together.

4. Inthe event that cases of falsification come to light Post Office Counters Ltd will view
such activities extremely seriously and in such circumstances almost certainly

consider termination of the Subpostmasters Contract for services.

APPENDIX 2
SUB-POSTMASTER SPECIFICATION

The following specification sets out the key outputs that Sub-postmasters must deliver in respect of

the undertaking of mailwork in sub post offices. It should pe read in conjunction with the Royal Mail

Specification

The phraseology uses the term “output”. This represents the achievement of an outcome for which
the Sub-postmaster is responsible. It does not necessarily mean that the Sub-postmaster has to
personally perform the task to deliver the output. For example, “RM employees briefed in
accordance with employee communication programme: does not necessarily mean that the Sub-
postmaster has to lead formal team briefing sessions. It will mean that the Sub-postmaster will be
responsible for distributing written briefing, facilitating team briefings lead by the RM line manager,

passing on urgent messages for, the line manager to RM employees

There are a number of outputs, particularly in the Customer and Supervision areas, which cannot be
tightly defined and where an element of discretion is needed in determining the level of Sub-
postmasters involvement. In these cases a test of reasonableness applies. In general terms, Sub-
postmasters are expected to deal with issues that can easily be resolved on the spot. But there is no
requirement for them to leave the mailwork premises to do so. In all cases where Sub-postmasters are
unable to resolve issues or believe that resolution requires additional capability, such difficulties must

be referred to the RM Line Manager.

The detailed local arrangements as to how each output will be achieved at each office will be set out

in the Local Specification which will be agreed between Royal Mail, POCL and the Subpostmaster.
1 SUPERVISION

-RM employees adequately supervised at all times when on mailwork premises.
(NOTE: RM employees will be deemed to be adequately supervised if all the outputs in this

specification are achieved).

-Contact point provided for RM employees based at the mailwork office at all other times when they

are on duty.

APPENDIX 4

PAYMENT ON WITHDRAWAL OF MAILWORK

Where the whole or part of either category of Mailwork carried out at a sub-office is withdrawn by
Royal Mail or Royal Mail Parcelforce, the Subpostmaster will receive a lump sum, an amount
equivalent to 1.5 times the consequential annual reduction in pay. The reduction in pay should take

effect from the date of the withdrawal of the work.

Where appropriate, the payment should take account of all regular payments including the effect of
any reduction in the 3% addition paid for minor items of work which attract no specific payment.

Regular and intermittent allowances should also be included in calculating the amount due.

If the withdrawal of Mailwork happens in stages, the Subpostmaster should receive a lump sum in
respect of the reduction on each occasion. In cases where there is simultaneous loss and gain of
Mailwork the lump sum payment should be calculated on any nett loss.

Payments should not be made where the change is due to variations in traffic.

At least three months’ notice, or payment in lieu of three months’ notice will be paid on withdrawal
of Mailwork, except in those cases where the Subpostmaster’s contract is summarily terminated or

where he resigns to avoid summary termination.

Payment for the loss of Mailwork will not be made where work is withdrawn at:-

1 the request of the Subpostmaster;
2, the time of summary termination or resignation to avoid summary termination;
3. a minimum payment office which is already paid for more work than it carries out.

The annual revision date will be unaffected by withdrawal of Mailwork.
