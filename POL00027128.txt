Subject: 121 with Jane

Hi

You have your regular 121 with Jane later today.

T've not seen an agenda yet but issues you may want to raise could include:

1) Sparrow - an update on next steps following Jane's discussion with Tim on Monday. I understand that the plan is to work with Jonathan Swift to
complete the final report. There may be a need to have something capable of being published. At the very least I'd expect the report to be Fol'ed -
we might get away with legal privilege but easier to defend if something can be put in the public domain. In addition, what work does Jane expect to
flow from the report (and at what cost?).

2) Feedback from the ARC - as discussed at GE on Monday, there are probably lessons to be learnt. My sense is that some of the papers posed

problems without necessarily providing solutions or routes to solutions. In fairness, they probably were a fair reflection on where we are eg risk
management and policy development. But I also think we have a clearer view of where we are going than may have been apparent to eg Carla,

3) Accountabilities - I thought think this is something Jane will raise with you, potentially to prompt a wider discussion at GE. For example, I think
Jane has questions over whether our bonus measures are correct or have the potential to drive the wrong behaviours. Is accountability also too
disperse? No doubt, Jane will be able to give some examples to illustrate her concerns.

4) L300 - it would be good to get any initial feedback from Jane on her team's view of L300. Jane had very few SLT members in her team so several
of her team will have been drawn into L300 without that prior knowledge / experience.
