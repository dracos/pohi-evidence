1G - Transfer Session during Checking for Discrep

susiness Integration - BTC5 ~ Cycle 7

20 Counter Office with PWY WP 10993

la Transfer Session was attempted between Counter 18 to 19 during ‘Discrepancy
checks' prior to Stock Unit (SU) rollover. The pending transfer session

tablet was displayed on Counter 19 for several minutes and appeared to time
lout. Eventually, the user was able to login on Counter 19 without the
transfer being fully completed (Both counters being logged into by the same
User on the same Individual SU).

The similar effect was experienced during a Print Preview (‘Rem in by
jproduct') on Counter 2.

lA copy of the Installation Log and an extract of the MessageStore for Counter
H8 are attached.

laving looked at the problem it seems that, due to excess network activity,
the two counters were not in communication with each other and were therefore
seemingly disconnected. In this circumstance, the desktop will time out and
lallow the login so that users can log in after a counter crash.

Itt would probably be best to change the configuration of the rig so that
instead of using 1 24-port hub, it can mimic the live environment and use 3
HO-port hubs. If the problem persists with this configuration, then this
pe flagged to Escher or Rex Dixon because EPOSS has done all it can to
jprevent the session transfer at this point.

Ihilst it is understood that the test configuration is not the same as in the
hive estate, it may be worth pursuing both scenarios i.e. 1x24 hub across a
20 Counter Office as well as 3x10 Port hubs. This would cover varying
configurations in multi-counter outlets in the future.

pave,

FYI re 24 port hubs and possible implications,

lcareth says that this is expected behaviour

If} Response :

h. Whoever looked at the problem and decided that there was "Excess Network
ctivity", where is the evidence to support this statement?, How was the was
the network activity measured ?

2. The test environment is not as per the "live" estate, i.e the use of a 24
ort hub instead of 3 x 8 port hubs, therefore closing pinICL as the problem
lis irrelevant to the "live" estate.

[this problem has now been superseded by PC62030 which has the same problem
ith low network traffic. The new problem is being used as the basis for
investigating the problem. We are also looking at changing the 20 counter
configuration. Closing this PinICh.
