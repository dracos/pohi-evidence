Yes. It is the fact that she sees so much as beyond her control which made me most worried. It is her
alibi, That is why I pushed back and also why I asked her to flag up if there was anything she needed
which she couldn't get.

lam concerned that she won't cap SS off at the 47 because it's too difficult. And am also concerned
about their costs and why we haven't nailed those.

So! am sorry but I think you are right.

Hi Alice. Theresa confirmed it is on file.
Thank you for doing the meeting and the note. It makes me sad but doesn't surprise me.

There are two alerts for me - the first is your point about the bland Board paper: I have just seen a
bland update from Susan on this week's work, which I have immediately sent on to Chris, with
some concerns about lack of progress (some issues - SS costs and working party process -
remaining the same as when I left last Wednesday/Thurs) and no risks flagged at all. for example,
there is no colour on the fact that our external lawyers have issued disclosures on 9 cases, up
from 2 a week ago.

The second alert is how much Susan sees as ‘beyond her control’. One for my full return.

I will keep close to this and to Chris, who also was briefed to deal with the SS costs issue.
(Heartening he is rising to the challenge.)

Separate note to follow on your update - the last unless I need to bother you. P

Here is the document to which I was referring.
I should be grateful if you could make sure Paula sees it on her return (but no need for her
to see during her holiday).
Please can you make sure that no-one else sees it?
Many thanks
Alice
