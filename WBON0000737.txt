Hi Andrew

Attached is my initial draft of the SROOS Spot Review. There are one or two minor aspects I need to add to but
rather than wait for those to be clarified (should be sometime tomorrow) I thought you would appreciate an early
sight to start working your......erm....... magic?! Appreciate your time on this.

The draft runs to c. 5 pages but contains a number of responses to specific questions asked by Second Sight.

Simon — if you have any comments yourself on the draft could you let me know.

Regards
Steve

Hi Andrew

Yes, a response was provided to Second Sight in relation to SROOS based on what we believed were the key
questions SS wanted answered against the spot review.

Second Sight have subsequently submitted a different line of questioning — focusing more on the alleged Bracknell
site visit on the 19 August 2008 and the details within it. This has prompted us (POL) into a further investigation

which will require a formal response.

Happy to help as needed, though I thought that SR5 had already been sent to Second Sight?

Apologies if I've got confused somewhere.

Andrew — I will first pull together a version and then possibly use your skills to convert it into something a bit more
fluid and direct, however I'll work on it first and then move to contact you.
