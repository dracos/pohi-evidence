Re: Authority for Disclosure of Information

I currently have conduct of the confiscation investigation in your case.
On 1% June 2006 you signed Authority for Disclosure of Information for
2 Halifax plc accounts. These were submitted to your branch and we
received a respo! from Halifax Customer Services re the account
numbered _ __: They did not respond to the other authority
because the quoted account number was incorrect.

Accordingly to assist me in my investigations I request that you give
me authority for disclosure of any financial Institution accounts you
have or are a signatory to. I am particularly interested in the accounts
with the Halifax plc and Welcome Financial Services Ltd..

In view of this please find enclosed 2 copies of 2 partly completed
“Authority for Disclosure of Information” forms along with some blank
forms. If you agree to give authority I would ask that you complete the
two “Halifax plc “ and “ Welcome Financial Services Ltd ” forms and
give details of any other accounts with other financial institutions to
POL00064027

which you are a signatory and complete two authorities for disclosure
forms in respect each financial institution. Would you please then
return 2 copies of each authority to me at the address below.

In view of the pressing nature of this matter would you then please
return them to me within 7 days of receipt? If I do not hear from you I
will assume you have not consented.

If you have any queries please do not hesitate to contact me on the
number below.
