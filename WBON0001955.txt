I think we can crack on with this research.

I will call this afternoon to explain but it would be helpful prep if you can look at paras 175-185 of the letter of claim and
section 16 of the attached SPMR contract to get a feel for what Freeths are arguing. You may notice the wording in the
attached contract differs from the sections quoted by Freeths. That is because there are many versions of the SMPR
contract flying around — don't worry about this for the time being.

Thanks

It was good speaking to you — thanks for your time.

By way of a quick introduction (and so you have our details), my colleagues Andy and Tom are also working on the
group action. No doubt you will deal with us all at some point.

We'll look at the OSA at this end, informed by the helpful description you gave of how the OSA obligations apply in
practice to a modern SPMR (ie. that they apply narrowly in relation to internal stakeholder information, eg. budget-
related information /changes in vehicle excise duty / interest rates).

Separately, as we discussed, if you could speak to your colleagues about any further examples of the OSA's
application and come back to me, that would be very useful.

Thanks

Paul
