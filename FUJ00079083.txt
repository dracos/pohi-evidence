Re: POCL Infrastructure Acceptance Pack - Segment 3
Dear Bob,

I am now able to issue you with POCL Infrastructure Acceptance pack - Segment

3.

The structure of this Review pack now follows a criterion centred approach

with all the documents required for each criterion being provided.

In preparing this Review Pack I have identified the following changes from the
Acceptance Specification and Review Plan.

1.

1.

TI/IFS/008 - Pathway to Post Office TIS - will not be available for approx. two
weeks. This affects 478/3 which I propose is deferred to segment 4.

At our last discussion we agreed that Criterion 479/3 would now have a new
review document "Register of Connected Computer Systems". I now propose
that Criterion 478/8 is also associated with this document, together with the
currently declared AP/IFS/030 - Generic TIS. This criterion should also be
deferred to segment 4.

. Criterion 477/2 is currently planned for review using the document Asset

Register. I now propose that this criterion is deemed equivalent to the asset
section of criterion 914/20. This reads as follows :-

The CONTRACTOR shall maintain User, asset, problem and change
management databases.

This criterion is contained within CR/ACS/018 - Help Desk, and is being met
as part of a general site visit to the Horizon System Help Desk which will
demonstrate access to the outlet asset data. I can provide you with further
details of this visit if you wish.

I trust that these changes are acceptable, but please contact me if you have
any concerns or questions. I will address the various questions raised at our
last review meeting in separate correspondence.
