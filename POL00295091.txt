Subject: RE: RMG ARC paper draft re Horizon - urgent for review by Thurs midday
Attachment: ARC re IT controls 8 12 11 v3.doc
Dear all,

I have updated the flow diagram on page 2.
Comments on the text are:

Paragraph 1 — to add a sentence along the following lines “The IT control issues identified during the audit did not
question the integrity of accounting data in the system. Rather, they were recommendations about the documentation
and authorisation of changes to systems and about opportunities for streamlined assurance.” The rationale for this is
that for purposes of ongoing RMG Criminal Prosecution activity, Rob Wilson (RMG Head of Criminal Law) has advised
that were that not the case then current prosecutions would have to be stayed. It is important to make clear EY did not
challenge the integrity of accounting data in the system.

Paragraph 17 — final sentence. Shouldn't this be “..no electronic data is stored in the branch..” Some accounting and
transactional paperwork is stored in branch.

Thanks, Rod

Subject: RMG ARC paper draft re Horizon - urgent for review by Thurs midday

Dear all,
The RMG ARC requested a paper on the IT controls and the Horizon claims. With input from various experts this has
now been drafted but is clearly a sensitive area so I attach the draft for your review and comments before it goes to

Group for circulation to the ARC.

The meeting is on 8 December so we expect to have to send the paper over tomorrow so, with apologies for the late
timescale, it is attached.

The approach we have taken is to set out first the history of relationship with Fujitsu, then what Horizon does and how
we in POL are satisfied with the controls around it, then what we have done to improve the EY IT controls audit and
then finally the position on the claims.

Rod — we would like to amend the picture as explained in the text box but, sorry, I couldn't manage to make the
changes even with your instructions! - please could you do these asap tomorrow morning?

Regards,
Sarah
