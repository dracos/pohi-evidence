Branches must report a stock surplus or
shortage to the helpline and follow the
standard process. The transaction corrections
will be issued within 3 months of the date
the surplus or shortage is reported.

If a Branch does not follow this process then
the transaction correction will not be
issued. The same applies to any expected
transaction corrections for incorrect stock
adjustments.

2.1.10 Fraud Investigations

If there is a fraud investigation into any
Branches, this could delay the Transaction
Corrections being issued. This means the
timescales detailed above are unlikely to be
met.
Action: need to agree at the conformance
workshop, what if additional losses occur as a
result - who is liable?

2.1.11 Aged / Large volume / value Transaction
Corrections

significant or widespread issues with regard
to aged, high volume, high value will be
communicated to the Network and Service

manager in P&BA.

Branches will ensure that all Transaction
Corrections are accepted within 1 week of
receipt. Refer to section 2.3 for any
disputes and section 2.4 if this affects
Branch Trading. If a Transaction Correction
arrives on Branch Trading day, the branch has
to action it before they can roll their

corrections, they must settle these both in
