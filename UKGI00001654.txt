Hi guys,

Thoughts on the attached "beefed-up" agenda note gratefully received (as long as they don't push it over a side). It's
quite a crowded agenda for 30 minutes. Do we need to cover anything else off?

As for attendees, I'd be keen if Tim covered strategy stuff, Katrina covered POCA and Mike covered JFSA stuff. Peter,
Jai, Tobi, I hope you don't mind my standing you down for this one.

Thanks,

Will.
