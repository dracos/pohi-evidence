foe] Post Office Account User Access Procedure
FU ITSU FUJITSU RESTRICTED (COMMERCIAL IN
CONFIDENCE)

1. Introduction

This Post Office Account User Access Procedure details how access is to be gained to both physical and
technical assets within the PO Account and Fujitsu supporting functions, and is managed by a central
point, namely the CSPOA Security Operations Team.

This document sets out how access to these assets shall be created, managed and removed and reports
and monitors these requirements. The CSPOA Security Operations Team controls the access to systems
and any asset dedicated to PO Account and receives reports from other functions within Fujitsu who
provide a shared service to the account

1.1 Purpose

This document establishes the controls that PO Account has to meet to manage user access to its
assets, based on its contractual requirements in particular those shown below from Schedule A4
Legislation Policies and Standards.

4.1.2 “Fujitsu Services shall be compliant with ISO 27001.”

4.1.4 “Fujitsu Services shall adhere to the relevant parts of the CCD entitled “Community
Information Security Policy for Horizon” (CISP) (SVM/SEC/POL/0005) and co-operate with Post
Office to assist Post Office in complying with this standard and requirement.

4.1.5 “The confidentiality, integrity, availability, and completeness of data shall be maintained
throughout all storage, processes, and transmissions, including during periods of Service Failure
and recovery from Service Failure.”

Appendix A Section 6.1 refers to the control sections required for user management in the Fujitsu EMEIA
Security Master Policy Manual. Section 9.2 explains user access management requirements and also.
refers to Fujitsu Corporate Procedures that are required to follow Fujitsu's EMEIA Business Management
System (EBMS).

2 User System Access

2.1 Pre-requisites for allocation and removal of Access

Prior to access being requested for PO Account specific assets Fujitsu HR processes for joiners and
movers onto the account, including processes for RIO, RAR or ERIC, where shared services are used,
shall be followed.

For shared services Assignment Mangers will apply for resources via a RIO, RAR or Eric according to
Fujitsu corporate procedures.

Once employment is confirmed the Line Manager will initiate the relevant security clearance process that
is carried out by Fujitsu Group Security if the resource is new to Fujitsu. If an existing employee then
clearance will already exist and will be checked by POA.

Once the individual is accepted into the role and the relevant FPV1 clearance level is granted or under
way, the Assignment Manager can then apply for support system accesses to be set-up and for Fujitsu
Facilities management to provide physical access to relevant locations for the role.

If the individual fails clearance, HR and the Line Manager will be notified and the circumstances
discussed with the PO Account CISO and Operational Security Manager to determine how to proceed.

In addition, if an individual moves away from PO Account or leaves Fujitsu then the Fujitsu HR processes
are to be invoked by the individual's Line/Assignment Manager and the CSPOA Security Operations
Team notified of this to ensure revocation of their access from all PO Account specific assets.

For those individuals who are leaving Fujitsu Services completely, the Line/Assignment Manager must
follow HR policies and procedures for a termination. These can be found on EMEIA Connect.

2.2 CSPOA User Registry

The User Access Process on the PO Account is based on the creation and control of a registry of all
personnel who work on the account.

This register is controlled by the CSPOA Security Operations Team, and is maintained and updated on a
daily/as needed basis in line with requests being submitted and tracks all personnel working on the
account, the system access they have been given and any security clearance level that they have been
granted.

It will also aid any audit that may be required, by providing the details of personnel and access levels
granted.

The user access database holds the information about each individual who has been granted access and
the systems that they have been granted access to. In addition it contains details of the requestor, and
dates that this access was granted and revoked. Details of the systems held within this registry are
shown in Appendix B.

9 Appendix D: Live Systems Emergency Access

If emergency access is required for a user to the live system, then the request needs to be approved by
the requestor's assignment manager - this in turn then needs to be approved by the Sec Ops Manager,
the request cannot be actioned until we have approval.

Once approved by all parties a TFS call needs to be raised and sent to POA-NT Team for MSAD account
to be created/re-instated and approval email MUST be attached to the call, it is imperative that how long
the access is required is stated on the call. CSPOA Security will then need to call NT Team to inform
them of the request.

The emergency access request then shall be updated on the User Management Database and will need
to be recorded as ‘Users with heightened Privileges’.
