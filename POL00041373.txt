Rodric

Please find attached the rough draft of the Letter to Freeths. Please excuse typos / formatting problems, and as
discussed please don't circulate as it is still just an early draft at the moment.

Tony's had a few more goes at the Remote Access section. Points to note:

1. Tony's not happy with para 9.10 and the list of controls in Horizon that prevent the editing of data. He thinks
these are a hostage to fortune but I know Jane felt strongly about including this. One to discuss later.

2. We've slightly watered down the story around "Post Office relied on FJ's statements" in para 9.11. Having
reviewed all the back material, we are concerned that the issue of database access was flagged in the Deloitte
Board Briefing. Although my view is that it is still fair to say that POL relied on Fu, this is not clear cut and
therefore we need to be careful with our language.

We should have a polished up version of this ready tomorrow morning. My suggested plan is that we then:
1. Hold acon call to discuss the Remote Access bits asap (Counsel, me, you, Jane, Tom M, Rob, Mark)
2. Then circulate the whole letter for comments. I don’t think this needs to go to the full PLSG because it's a mainly
"legal" letter rather than factual statements about POL, but would welcome your thoughts once you've had a

chance to skim the attached.

Mr Underwood (by cc) — could you see if there is a slot for a call either tomorrow or Monday? I think we'll just need 30
mins.

Kind regards
Andy
