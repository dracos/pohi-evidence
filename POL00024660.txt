Following the conversation with Paula, Al and Kevin yesterday I have started to draft a briefing paper for the Board
which I have sent to Andy for legal input.

Set out below is my summary {awaiting Andy’s comments) of the terms which Freeths argue should be implied in to the
contract as duties on Post Office, and which I propose to include in the paper. Andy’s view is that those relating to
burden of proof are the ‘existential’ challenges, whereas the others could probably be managed - albeit at a cost. To
this end, I also attach the paper we looked at in July which sets out the high level risks, although it doesn’t match exactly
to the list below. We need to pull the risks and likely remediating actions together and then be able to have a further
conversation with Paula, Al and Kevin. I will try and get to this later tonight, but if you have any thoughts ~ they'd be
gratefully accepted!

Jane
