Yes, it needs to be a statement.

Please can you give me your full name, job title, what your role and responsibilities are, your
experience and how long you've worked for Fujitsu. I'll then draft the statement and send it to you to
approve. This will save you time given your holiday.

Kind regards. Stephen

Thanks Andy. I've discussed this with Anne and what we need from you is an overview of calls as Anne
isn't able to give evidence of them, so we'll remove those parts from Anne's statement. Would you be
able to let me have something?

Kind regards. Stephen

Hi Stephen,

What I have supplied Graham in the past is a statement listing all calls logged to the helpdesk and a brief explanation of
the call if necessary, I am unaware if we have been requested to supply this already but can do if needed.

Please note that I have no technical knowledge of the audit retrieval system and supply this statement only as an
overview of the calls logged.

Andy
Can you please check if we have already completed this work, otherwise please discuss with Stephen D the
requirements.

I presume its just to present the calls in the usual format, commenting on if they have any relevance to the investigation or
not?

Thanks

Dear Anne,

Many thanks for this. Are you available this afternoon for a telephone call to discuss at say around
2.30pm

In the meantime, what I do also need is someone from Fujitsu who is comfortable summarising all the call
logs to HSH (we'll then separate this bit out from your draft statement). There were numerous people at
HSH who took these calls, (too many to all call as witnesses) so please can you and Brian identify a HSH
call supervisor to whom I could speak, asap?

Stephen,
I have only today received this draft, and am attempting to go through it.

I'm somewhat concerned about my witness statement containing all the Powerhelp calls, given that I had no involvement
with them at the time - I would have looked at a number of the earlier calls when investigating e-0402251077 (para 26),
but none of the later ones. I was unaware of problems at the branch until 26th February when the call was sent to SSC.

The way it is laid out at the moment is neither a verbatim transcript of the calls, nor my interpretation of what was probably
meant at the time. I can provide the latter if that is what is required, but there needs to be a clear delineation between
what was stated then and comments I make now.

I do not particularly want to be questioned on the handling of calls by HSH, since I did not and continue to have no
responsibility for this.

I have many changes and comments to make to the witness statement (not least, can you please spell my name
correctly) but would like to get this clarified first.

Regards,
Anne

Ann

If you remember we discussed this at our meeting a while ago. Stephen has now put together a statement for you to
review and which you are free to amend alter or add anything you like.

Gratefull if you can go through this to ensure what the statement says is correct and you are happy with it.
Please advise Stephen if there are any innacurracies or if you have any concerns at all.

Also please let me know if you have any questions at all on this.

‘ement of Ann Chambers (Post Office Limited -v- Lee Castleton)

Dear Brian,

I refer to my e-mail of 2 August and attach the first draft of a Witness Statement and exhibit for Ann
Chambers. This is designed to run through the HSH call log reports and explain them to a Judge. Please
can Ann have a look at the first draft, make any changes she feels are appropriate and also answer my
questions in bold italics. Once I get feedback from Ann, then I will revise the statement with Counsel.

I look forward to hearing from you or Ann as soon as possible.

Kind regards.
