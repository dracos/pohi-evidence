Notebooks

Notebooks are issued by the Post Office Ltd Security Team and consist of
100 numbered, double-sided, lined pages in a bound pad.

Notebook entries should include the following;

Details of observations

Details of interviews quoting Master Tape serial numbers

Details of suspect offender approaches

Details of searches

Details of conversations with informants

Details of other conversations or verbal statements

Factual matters such as the preparation of a test item, the movement
of evidence etc

One person can make an entry which is countersigned by another person
present at the same event — they must have seen exactly the same thing. If
that is the case it is permissible for the two Investigation Managers to discuss
the matter prior to the entry being made but an entry needs to be made in the
notebook that they had done so.

It is important to be aware that in these circumstances the two colleagues are
“consulting” with each other not “colluding”

Date

Time

Description of item

Where found

Witness details

Any other persons present

Was the recovered item placed in an exhibit bag?

Was a signature obtained for the completed notebook entry?

Ask whether a friend was offered to the witness — make the point that
taking a notebook entry in this way is no different to the other
circumstances when a friend would be offered.
