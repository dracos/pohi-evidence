Donald, you may remember this has reared its head before. I'll get a brief circulated for the new board members.

In summary, each time any cases have gone to court, POL's position has been upheld. And from memory, in at least
2 cases fraud was proven with subsequent imprisonment.

However, to avoid to avoid future doubt, POL took a decision several months ago to have Horizon and the newer
HNGx (Horizon online) independently verified by an external systems auditor. This is currently in process and we

should have the results at the end of next month.

Paula,

I was a bit surpised to see the article in Private Eye this week about a class action by subpostmasters. It may be a bit
after the horse has bolted but it may be appropriate to have an explicit litigation/legal report in the POL board papers
for the future - obviously Alice's call.

The article raises some questions about Horizon. I suspect the ARC ought to take an interest. Have we ever had an
independent audit of Horizon?

Donald
