PART 2 - OPERATING A MAIN BRANCH
The Operator and the Branch

1.1 The Operator agrees to operate the Branch on
behalf of Post Office Ltd in accordance with the terms of the Agreement
(including for the avoidance of doubt the Manual).

1.2 The Agreement is a contract for services and
the Operator is an agent and not an employee of Post Office Ltd. The Operator
acknowledges that no relationship of employer and employee exists between
Post Office Ltd and the Operator, or between Post Office Ltd and any
Assistant.

The National Federation of Subpostmasters (the NFSP) is an independent
members organisation supporting operators of Post Office branches across the
UK and is solely acknowledged by Post Office Ltd as a representative body of
operators. The NFSP is the only body with which Post Office Ltd will seek to
discuss and consult on matters affecting operators, subject to any legal,
regulatory or political obligations. Such discussions will take place within the
existing and developing relationship framework.

1.4 For clarity, the Operator is permitted to
provide the Products and Services from the Branch Premises but not from any
other location (unless otherwise agreed in advance in writing between the
Parties).

1.5 Post Office Ltd shall provide:

1.5.1a helpline to enable the Operator to consult with Post Office Ltd about
running the Branch (details of the helpline are contained within the

Manual);

1.5.2the Operator with stocks of Products and documentation to use in the
Branch.

1.6 Post Office Ltd has the right to enter into

contracts or arrangements with Clients for the handling of Products or the
supply of Services by the Network (including the Branch) on such terms as
Post Office Ltd considers fit. Post Office Ltd retains the discretion as to where
within the Network particular products and services are offered.

1.7 Where the Operator is a partnership, each
partner shall be jointly and severally responsible for the performance or non-
performance of the Operator’s obligations in the Agreement.

1.8 The Operator shall notify Post Office Ltd of any
changes to the nature of the Basic Business (including through the addition of
any new category of business), and Post Office Ltd may terminate the
Agreement on not less than 1 months' notice, or immediately, if Post Office
Ltd reasonably regards such change as bringing Post Office Ltd and/or the
Branch and/or its business into disrepute.

Assistants and Training

2.1 The Operator shall ensure at all times that
only Assistants have any access to or involvement with the Branch and Post
Office Ltd’s information systems, but this shall not restrict any access by Post
Office Ltd and/or its authorised representatives to the Branch and Post Office
Ltd’s information systems.

BM20 - CLEARED FOR USE 11.1,

shall:

the operation of the System and initial sales training. The number and
identity of such personnel to receive the training shall be determined by
Post Office Ltd in consultation with the Operator. The training will last for
up to 14 days, of which six to eight days will be spent in a classroom or
another offsite location, and the other six days will be spent at the
Branch Premises; and

2.3.2provide Sales Model training for all of the first Manager(s) and
Assistants. The Sales Model training required will be delivered at any
location and shall be for such duration as Post Office Ltd may
reasonably determine. Post Office Ltd shall give the Operator advance
notice of the training so that the Operator has a reasonable opportunity
to make arrangements for the management of the Branch while the
training is being undertaken.

2.4 The Operator shall ensure that each Manager
who receives the training cascades the training to all other Assistants and to
any replacement Manager(s), in order to ensure that all subsequent Managers
and all other Assistants receive sufficient initial training from properly trained
Managers. The Operator shall further ensure that the Sales Model is fully
implemented in the Branch.

2.5 Post Office Ltd may require the Manager(s)
and/or the Assistants to undertake further training at any reasonable location
and time during the Term if Post Office Ltd:

2.5.1 reasonably considers such training to be essential; or

2.5.2 wishes to train them in new and improved techniques which have been
devised and which the Operator will be required to use in operating the
System.

2.6 The Operator shall ensure that such
Manager(s) and Assistants attend the training provided by Post Office Ltd

under clauses [2.3] and

2.7 Any failure by the Operator to comply with its
obligations pursuant to this clause [2] shall be deemed to be a material breach
of the Agreement and any failure by the Operator to comply with clause [2.2
only shall be deemed to be a material breach of the Agreement which cannot
be remedied.

2.8 The Operator shall be responsible for the costs
of the Manager(s) and/or Assistants attending the training referred to in
clauses and (including, as appropriate, salary, travel, accommodation
and subsistence), but the cost of delivering the training shall be met by Post
Office Ltd.

Branch.. All such career wear required by the Operator from time to
time during the Term shall be at the Operator’s own cost. All career
wear shall be obtainable by the Operator from Post Office Ltd or its
nominated supplier;

2.9.5 ensure that all Managers and Assistants wear identification badges, as
supplied by Post Office Ltd, when working in the Branch. Such
identification badges shall be obtainable from Post Office Ltd or its
nominated supplier at the Operator's cost;

2.9.6 itself provide, and procure from all its Personnel an undertaking, in the
form specified or referred to in the Manual, not to use or disclose to any
third party any Official Information or Personal Data which they may
acquire. The Operator shall provide all Personnel with a copy of their
undertaking as a reminder of the obligations contained in it. The
Operator shall take such steps at its own expense as Post Office Ltd may
require in order to enforce this undertaking and/or to restrain any
breach of it;

2.9.7immediately notify Post Office Ltd of any request made to the Operator,
an Assistant or any other Personnel by any person for information which
may be confidential (including any Official Information and/or Personal
Data) or any request for information under the Freedom of Information
Act 2000 relating to the Branch, Post Office Ltd, the Agreement or any
related matter and shall not comply with such a request until it has
obtained Post Office Ltd’s written consent to the disclosure;

2.9.8 if there is any allegation or evidence of fraud or dishonest conduct or
criminal activity on the part of the Operator, the Manager, the
Assistants, any Customers or any other person, including any practice
undertaken by the Operator (or any Assistant) with a view to artificially
inflating the Fees (as referred to in clause of Part 3), the Operator
shall immediately notify Post Office Ltd and co-operate fully with any
investigation which may be made by Post Office Ltd’s Investigation
Division, the police and/or any investigator appointed by any Client;

2.9.9 properly complete, and ensure that the Assistants properly complete,

notified by Post Office Ltd.

clause in respect of the completion of the Compliance Training by the
relevant deadlines, Post Office Ltd may take such steps as it considers

BM20 - CLEARED FOR USE 11.1,

D2.1/13/31

appropriate to ensure compliance with clause by the Operator,

including:

2.10.1 sending reminder letter(s) or other appropriate
communications to the Operator, and/or the Branch/outreach service;

2.10.2 making a reminder phone call to the Operator,
and/or the Branch/outreach service; and/or

2.10.3 after prior notice to the Operator, sending a
Post Office Ltd representative to visit the Branch/outreach service to
ensure that the training is properly completed.

2.11 Where Post Office Ltd considers it necessary, including where the Operator
has persistently failed to comply with its obligations under the Agreement
(whether in relation to the same obligation or not, and whether or not such
failures are material in nature), it will send a Post Office Ltd representative to
the Branch to deliver remedial training to the Manager and/or its Assistants.
The Operator shall ensure that the Manager(s) and Assistants attend this
training.

2.12 Post Office Ltd may require the Operator to pay Post Office Ltd’s reasonable
costs and expenses of carrying out the steps described in clauses
including the costs and expenses of travel, staff time and overnight
accommodation where required. In all cases, these costs and expenses may

statements are in accordance with the requirements of clauses Fenewe)

arrested, charged or investigated by the police or Post Office Ltd in
connection with any offence or alleged offence;

Operator and/or any Assistant; or

irregularities or misconduct in the operation of the Branch, the Basic
Business or any other Post Office® branches with which the Operator
and/or any Assistant is connected (including any financial irregularities
or misconduct).

15.2 During the period of any suspension, whether under clause I15.1] or otherwise,
Post Office Ltd may:

temporary substitutes as quickly as possible and to enable the temporary
substitutes and their staff to operate the Branch (including by allowing the
temporary substitutes and their staff access to the Branch Premises and the

operating the Branch) during the period of suspension. Post Office Ltd shall
pay a fee to the Operator for each day on which the temporary substitute

Fees Booklet or otherwise by written notification by Post Office Ltd to the
Operator. Any such amendment or addition to the Fees Booklet shall take
effect on the date set out in the notification to the Operator, and it is
acknowledged that any such change may take effect immediately.

2.2 The Operator acknowledges that it shall not be
entitled to receive any compensation or other sums in the event of any

variation to the Fees Booklet (and the Products, Services and Fees referred to
in it).

2.3 Those Products and Services listed in the Fees
Booklet and marked with an asterisk (*) (Direct Sale Products and
Services) are those in respect of which either:

2.3.1sales cannot be concluded in the Branch by the Operator and/or its
Assistants but can only be concluded as a result of Customers
subsequently contacting internet websites or call centres operated on
behalf of Post Office Ltd; or

2.3.2(where Post Office Ltd has specified this to the Operator in writing in
respect of any Direct Sale Product or Service), sales can be concluded
both in the Branch and as a result of Customers subsequently
contacting internet websites or call centres operated on behalf of Post
Office Ltd.

In relation to Direct Sale Products and Services, the references in the Fees
Booklet to “per Transaction”, “per policy”, “per bond”, “per £1 sales”, “per
loan” etc. are references to the actual conclusion of the sale of the relevant
Direct Sale Product or Service, whether through such websites or call centres
or (where Post Office Ltd has specified in accordance with clause I2 of this
Part 3) in the Branch, and do not refer merely to any introduction of

For the avoidance of doubt, and without prejudice to any provision in the Fees
Booklet, Post Office Ltd shall not pay any Fees to the Operator in respect of
any Transaction which Post Office Ltd reasonably believes to have been

inflating the Fees (and where such Fees have already been paid by Post Office
Ltd, Post Office Ltd shall be entitled to deduct an equivalent amount from any
future payment due to the Operator).

second Accounting Periods (calculated with effect from the Accounting Period
within which the Start Date falls) shall be the First Fees Payments specified in

Fees after the date of termination of the Agreement for Transactions carried

shall deduct as required by law. Post Office Ltd shall periodically provide the
Operator with the details of the Fees and other payments due to the Operator
and the Taxes deducted by Post Office Ltd.

Commencement Date and is subsequently required to register for VAT he shall
do so and shall notify Post Office Ltd of the registration in a timely manner. If
the Operator fails to register for VAT when required to do so or fails to
promptly notify Post Office Ltd of his VAT registration, the Operator, and not
Post Office Ltd, shall be responsible for the value of any claim from HMRC for
VAT on the payments made to the Operator under the Agreement and the
Operator shall reimburse Post Office Ltd on demand and in full in respect of
any such claim.

2.9 Where the Operator is registered for VAT, the
Fees are exclusive of any VAT (which shall be payable by Post Office Ltd in
addition where applicable).

2.10 Unless the Fees are subject to the Taxes, Post
Office Ltd and the Operator agree that a self-billing arrangement will operate
in respect of the Fees due under the Agreement. Therefore, the Parties agree
that:

2.10.1 Post Office Ltd will issue self-billing invoices
showing the Operator’s name, address and VAT registration number
(where applicable), together with all other details which constitute a

but in any event the pro-rated amount to be paid by the Operator shall not be
more than £2,000 plus the costs of obtaining and installing the Post Office Ltd
Funded Equipment. Post Office Ltd will notify the Operator in writing of the
pro-rated amount owed and provide a breakdown of the relevant Set Up
Costs. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Agreement is terminated prior to
the Start Date, or prior to Post Office Ltd notifying the Operator of the Start
Date in accordance with the Preface, the Operator shall repay any Set Up

the contrary) an item of Equipment is to be returned or delivered up to Post Office
Ltd or at its direction to a New Operator or Post Office Ltd’s supplier on the
termination of the Agreement is summarised in Appendix 2 to the Preface.

Post Office Ltd may from time to time after the Commencement Date add or remove

arranging and ensuring all repairs and maintenance of, and shall observe all
statutory obligations and regulations in respect of the operation of, the relevant
item of Equipment. Post Office Ltd will maintain the Horizon equipment and Post

Transactions, and/or additional terminals or self-service equipment (together
referred to as the PO Terminals). Post Office Ltd will discuss with the Operator the
position within the Branch Premises where the PO Terminals are to be located, but,
in the absence of agreement, Post Office Ltd (acting reasonably) will determine such
location. Where Post Office Ltd does provide PO Terminals, the Operator shall ensure
that they are used solely to conduct Transactions. Post Office Ltd will arrange
(whether directly or through the Operator) for the PO Terminals to be installed at the
specified location.

Ltd or on Post Office Ltd’s behalf must only be used in the operation of the Branch
and must not be resold or transferred to a third party. Where the Operator has
surplus consumables it should advise Post Office Ltd of this fact and, as appropriate,
arrange with Post Office Ltd for the return of the excess quantity.

used in the operation of the Branch, the Post Office Ltd split billing policy (as
contained in the Manual or otherwise notified to the Operator from time to time)
shall apply in respect of such official telephone line. If Post Office Ltd determines
that a second telephone line (which is in addition to the one provided by Post Office
Ltd) is required in order to operate the Branch, such second telephone line shall be
arranged by the Operator but will be paid for by Post Office Ltd unless Post Office

PART 6 - NON-COMPETE RESTRICTIONS AND HOW THEY AFFECT BRANCH
PREMISES

A. During the Term of the Agreement, the following provisions shall apply.

1.1 The appointment of the Operator gives the Operator the right to transact, and
to receive payment for, certain items of business on behalf of Post Office Ltd.
The conditions of the appointment also involve such non-compete restrictions
on the private activities of the Operator in relation to the Branch Premises as
are fundamental and necessary to ensure the continued viability of the
Network.

It is important to the future of the Network that all operators support Post
Office® products and services. An operator who offers products or services in
its private retail business from the Branch Premises which compete with Post
Office® products and services can reduce the revenue generated by the
Branch and the Network. This revenue is essential to provide a contribution to
Post Office Ltd’s fixed costs of maintaining the Network. Without this
contribution, Post Office Ltd might not be able to sustain the Network. It is
therefore also in the interests of all operators to support this principle.

It is also in the interests of all operators that Post Office Ltd is able to seek and
negotiate business opportunities for the whole Network and that it does not
allow Clients or suppliers to enter into arrangements directly with selected Post
Office® branches only to the disadvantage of the rest of the Network. This
would adversely affect Post Office Ltd’s ability to maintain the Network as a
whole.

Operators benefit from being part of the Network. In addition to payments
which operators receive from Post Office Ltd, Post Office Ltd invests in
advertising that brings Customers into Post Office® branches, it ensures that
Post Office® products and services meet regulatory requirements and it
provides customer and business services such as helplines to support
operators.

Accordingly, except as permitted by and in compliance with any waiver granted
by Post Office Ltd in accordance with clause 1.11 of this Part 6, the Operator
must not undertake in a private capacity, or allow anyone else to undertake in
relation to the Branch Premises, the types of business listed in clause 1.6 of this
, aS amended by Post Office Ltd from time to time in accordance with
clause 1.8 of this Part 6.

The non-compete restrictions on private business activities in relation to the
Branch Premises are as follows:

(i) business concerned with the provision of services relating to the
collection, conveyance and/or delivery of letters, parcels and packages
(collectively called “Packets” in this clause) including without prejudice to
the generality of the foregoing: the sale of stamps, pre-paid postage labels
and stationery with prepaid postage; the acceptance, retention, sortation,
return and redirection of Packets (including Packets containing mail order
or other home shopping goods and other Packets); and the acceptance of
payment for such services;

(ii) services for the payment of bills, the collection of payments (including pre-
payments) or the collection of revenue (whether by the sale of stamps or
meter tokens, the charging of budget keys or by other means) in
connection with services for the supply of water, gas, fixed line
telephones, electricity, cable or satellite television, or local authority
services;

(iii) the sale of National Lottery products;

(iv) Banking, Building, Industrial and Provident Society, Friendly Society or
Credit Union business or otherwise making available banking facilities
including, without limitation, cheque-cashing, bureau de change (including
the selling and buying back of currency, on demand and pre-order
services), collecting deposits or providing withdrawal facilities on behalf of
deposit-takers whether over-the-counter or through an automated teller

machine (ATM) or providing loans, credit cards or other forms of credit or
credit brokerage services but not including the provision of cash-back
transactions or the provision of basic saving stamp schemes which do not
involve the return of cash to participants in the scheme. For the avoidance
of doubt, a cash-back transaction is the withdrawal of cash via a debit card
scheme, from the account associated with the card used, as part of a
transaction for the purchase of goods or services through the same
scheme; and

(v) any financial services business or otherwise making available facilities
which may compete with the financial services activities carried on or to
be carried on by operators at any time for or on behalf of Post Office Ltd or
through Post Office® branches or which may compromise the regulatory
status of Post Office Ltd (including for this purpose, its operators) in its role
as appointed representative of Post Office Ltd’s financial service product
providers, including, for the avoidance of doubt, the promotion of
competing financial services but not including the provision of basic
savings stamps schemes which do not involve the return of cash to
participants in the scheme.

1.7 These non-compete restrictions apply to all methods of transaction of the areas
of business set out above. This includes, without limitation, the use of
smartcards, ATMs and on-line terminals.

1.8 The categories of business listed in clause 1.6 of this Part 6 constitute the
current non-compete restrictions but Post Office Ltd reserves the right to review
these restrictions in the light of changing business requirements, varying them
if necessary. All operators will be given at least 12 months’ notice in writing of
any such changes. No restrictions will be introduced on products or services
other than Key Products and Services, as defined in clause 1.9 of this [Part 6.

1.9 Key Products and Services are the core products and services offered by Post
Office Ltd. The Key Products and Services are:

(i) Letters, parcels and packages services of any kind and related services;

(ii) Services for the payment of bills, collection of payment or collection of
revenue;

(iii) National Lottery products;

(iv) Banking services, including bureau de change;
(v) Financial services;

(viii) Postal orders;

(ix) Savings stamps;

(x) Benefits’ distribution and Government services;
(xi) Motor vehicle and driver licensing services and other motorist services;
(xii) Telephony products and services;

(xiii) Travel ticketing and travel passes; and

(xiv) Television licensing services.

Post Office Ltd reserves the right to amend this list of Key Products and
Services from time to time. No new products or services will be introduced to
this list which are not current or future key sources of revenue and/or
contribution for Post Office Ltd.

1.10 If the Operator is considering taking up a new private retail business
opportunity which may fall within the scope of the non-compete restrictions
specified in clause 1.6 of this Part 6, it should, before taking up any such
