Brief details of claim

The Claimants’ claims are made pursuant to a Group Litigation Order -dated 21 March 2017 (the “GLO”) made
under CPR Part19.11 for the purpose of the court managing the Post Office Group Litigation.

This claim form (“the 2 Claim Form”) is issued pursuant to paragraph 12 of the GLO and is the second claim form
issued to date within the Post Office Group Litigation, the first having been issued on 11 April 2016 (and Amended
on 26 July 2017) (“the 1 Claim Form”). The 1** Claim Form comprised claims by 198 Claimants, and this 2" Claim
Form comprises a further 324 Claimants as listed on the attached schedule beginning from Claimant number 199
(sequential numbering from the 1“ Claim Form).

The Claimants are a large group of people (and/or companies) appointed and/or engaged at various times under
standard form contracts by the Defendant as Sub-Postmasters (or in some cases, as Crown Office employees) and/or
to work in or operate Post Office branches, or acting in such or similar capacity, who have been subjected to unlawful
treatment by the Defendant causing them significant financial losses (including loss of their business and property),
bankruptcy, prosecutions, serving community or custodial sentences, distress and related ill-health, stigma and/or
reputational damage.

The said standard form contracts were replete with power and discretion in the hands of the Defendant. In all the
circumstances, they included an implied term of trust and confidence and/or were re/ational contracts imposing
obligations of good faith on the Defendant (including duties of fair dealing and transparency, trust and confidence and
co-operation). There were also implied terms, including obligations on the Defendant: not to act in an arbitrary,
irrational or capricious manner in decision-making affecting the Claimants; to provide adequate training and support
to the Claimants (particularly if and when it imposed new working practices or systems or required the provision of
new services); properly to execute all transactions which the Claimants effected; properly to account for, record and
explain all transactions and any alleged shortfalls which were attributed to the Claimants; and properly and fairly to
investigate any such alleged shortfalls.

Further, by reason of the agency relationship between the Claimants and the Defendant and/or in all the circumstances
(and having particular regard to the Defendant imposing and undertaking to provide the system by which transactions
were effected, recorded and reconciled and the vulnerability of the Claimants to the exercise of power by the
Defendant in this and other respects), the Defendant owed the Claimants a fiduciary duty properly to execute all
transactions which the Claimants effected and properly to account for, record and explain all transactions and any
alleged shortfalls which were attributed to the Claimants. Further or alternatively, the relationship amounted to an
accounting relationship so as to give rise to such duties. The Defendant also owed the Claimants a duty of a care in
tort in exercising its functions and powers within its relationship with the Claimants.

The claims herein arise following the Defendant’s introduction of a new electronic point of sale system known as
Horizon in or around 1999/2000 and changes (including new or changed services) introduced by the Defendant

POL-0108447
POL00110802
POL00110802

thereafter. Horizon itself significantly changed how the Claimants were required and able to work in their branches
and severely limited their ability to access, identify, obtain and reconcile transaction records and themselves
investigate any alleged shortfalls. From the introduction of Horizon and throughout, the Defendant failed to provide
adequate training and support to the Claimants. When financial, accounting and other alleged errors or failures arose,
including or resulting in alleged shortfalls in branch accounts, the Defendant in purported exercise of its contractual
and/or prosecutorial powers: did not investigate the existence and/or causes of the alleged shortfalls fairly, properly or
at all; required Claimants to make good the alleged shortfalls; encouraged Claimants to sign-off cash balances
without being able to satisfy themselves that they were accurate and/or exercised undue or unreasonable pressure or
influence on Claimants to do so; excluded Claimants from their own branches; suspended and/or terminated their
appointments and/or engagements and/or imposed undue and/or unreasonable pressure or influence upon Claimants to
resign or otherwise end their contract with the Defendant; unfairly investigated the Claimants (including by
preventing or impeding any or any reasonable access by the Claimants to relevant data, information and documents
and/or excluding from consideration the known risk, if not likelihood, of errors in or related to the Horizon system
and/or related matters set out herein); mispresented to the Claimants the approach to and purpose of such
investigations; prosecuted them for theft, false accounting and/or other criminal charges and took other measures
against them including pursuing restraint orders against them (under s.41 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002);
procured repayments and/or the settlement of claims by means of negligent misstatement and/or misrepresentation or
deceit; unreasonably acted so as to prevent or inhibit Claimants from preserving, realising or recovering the value of
their businesses including their capital investments and/or capital payment entitlements payable by the Defendant
upon branch closures; and/or otherwise acted wholly unreasonably, oppressively and/or arbitrarily and, in any event,
in breach of the Defendant’s duties.

Throughout, the Defendant concealed material facts from the Claimants and thereby misled them about: the reliability
of Horizon and the errors in, and generated by, Horizon; the problems encountered by other Sub-Postmasters in using
Horizon (Claimants being informed that they were the only one); the ability of the Defendant (or its IT provider, ICL
and later Fujitsu, on its behalf) remotely to access and make changes to transactions, data and/or branch accounts,
without the knowledge of the Claimants; the approach to investigations and audits following identification of alleged
shortfalls and the purpose for which the Defendant carried out the same; the basis upon which the Defendant chose to
prosecute or refer Claimants for prosecution and/or to take related steps above; and/or the extent to which the
Defendant had discharged its duties set out above in the exercise of all its aforesaid powers and discretions. Further
or alternatively, the Defendant deliberately committed breach(es) of duty in circumstances in which the same was
unlikely to be discovered for some time by the Claimants and thereby deliberately concealed the facts involved in that
breach of duty.

By reason of the Defendant's said conduct, the Defendant is liable to the Claimants for: breach of express and/or
implied contractual terms; breach of duties of care in tort; breach of fiduciary duty; unjust enrichment; harassment
under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997; negligent misstatement;_misrepresentation; deceit; sslavfulmeies
sance-in-public-offiee:By reason of the Defendant's conduct in relation to
the pros of Claimants, th efendant is liable for breach of the Claimants’ rights
under ‘Articles 6 and 8 ECHR and/or Article 1 of the First Protocol contrary to section 6(1) of the Human Rights Act
1998; and/or procuring a breach of their common law fair trial rights and/or rights under Article 6 and 8 ECHR and/or
Article 1 of the First Protocol as aforesaid.
