The Misra case was closed 1% March 2011 but she has been in court in April 2012 re confiscation hearing see new article
on link below.

Can we have a update on this and a view on if any further work re Civil recovery would be viable as it looks like there are
no assets left here to go after

This is one of the cases on our Horizon issues Spreadsheet that we may need to close.

Cheers Alison
