Statement of Gareth Idris Jenkins

Age if under 18 Over 18 (If over 18 insert 'over 18")

Ihave been employed by Fujitsu Services, working on the Post Office Account, formally ICL
Pathway Ltd., since 1996 as a Customer Solutions Architect, involved in many aspects of
design and implementation of the computer system known as Horizon, which is a computerised

accounting system used by Post Office Ltd.

There are three main reasons why a zero value transaction may be generated as part of the
banking system:
1. The transaction has no financial effect (ie a Balance Enquiry or a PIN Change)
2. The transaction has been declined by the Bank
3 There has been some sort of System Failure. Such failures are normal
occurrences.

Each transaction has associated with it a Response Code field which identifies what has
happened. These values are included (together with their descriptions) in the ARQs. In
summary:

RespCd = 1, means that the transaction was Authorised by the Bank. If it is for
zero value, then this means it had no Financial effect. In all the example, such
transactions were PIN Changes or Balance Enquiries where this is indeed the case.

RespCd has a value between 2 and 10 means that the transaction was Declined
by the Bank. The actual value indicates why (eg 3 means that the PIN was invalid
and 4 means Insufficient funds)

RespCd with a value greater than 10 implies some sort of system failure The
actual value provides further information as to the nature of the failure within the
overall system

Continuation of statement of Gareth Idris Jenkins

I produce a copies of the nil transaction spreadsheets for ARQs 401, 459 and 460 Exhibits
GIJ/01, GIJ/02 and GIJ/03.

There is no reason to believe that the information in this statement is inaccurate because of the
improper use of the computer. To the best of my knowledge and belief at all material times the
computer was operating properly, or if not, any respect in which it was not operating properly, or
was out of operation was not such as to effect the information held on it

Any records to which I refer in my statement form part of the records relating to the business of
Fujitsu Services. These were compiled during the ordinary course of business from information
supplied by persons who have or may reasonably be supposed to have personal knowledge of the
matter dealt with in the information supplied, but are unlikely to have any recollection of the
information or cannot be traced. As part of my duties, I have access to these records.

I'm not sure that the yellow bit is true. Can this be deleted? All I’ve done is interpret the data
in spreadsheets that you have emailed to me.
