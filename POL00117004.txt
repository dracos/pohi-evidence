That’s consistent with my brief conversations with him. I won’t raise it again given you’re speaking to him but will
pass on any further information. On a general point, Andy is on orders to be supportive and helpful at the moment
due to the IR Review I have just started. This makes it less likely, though not impossible, that he would choose to
weigh in with the JFSA.

Thank you Jane.

On the Andy Furey point, I saw him today. He is considering what the CWU position will be, he said. He suggested that
he was not keen to give evidence but was under pressure internally to do so. He said there were two issues: first, re
Horizon. Secondly, our handling of the issue.

We agreed to discuss further and I will brief Tom (copied).
