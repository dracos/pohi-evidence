1 Introduction

This document has been produced as one in the series of strategy documents
reflecting the processes involved in the implementation of the Horizon
counter systems. This document defines ICL Pathway’s strategy for the
phasing of the rollout of the Horizon counter infrastructure, whilst giving
consideration to requirements defined by the Programme Delivery Authority,
which relate to the order in which the Post Offices are implemented.

2 Scope

The scope of this document is as follows:

e To define the various phases of the programme leading to the start of
national rollout

e To provide a high level overview of the implementation programmes
covering the UK for the national rollout

e To define the implementation programmes and their association with large
conurbations and BA districts, in addition to defining the criteria by which the
programme will be undertaken. Sequencing of the rollout by BA District within
each implementation programme is defined in Ref[1] and Ref[2].

3 Rollout Strategy

The Rollout of counter equipment into post offices has been defined into a
number of distinct phases which cover the live trial of the early releases of
Horizon. Upon successful completion of the trial phases, the national rollout
of counter equipment will commence through four defined Implementation
Programmes. The preparation of the post office infrastructure to allow the
installation of counter equipment will start prior to and be conducted
separately from the rollout of counter equipment. However the infrastructure
programme will be undertaken in an order to ensure timely availability of
prepared post offices to satisfy the installation and awareness programme.

For each programme the sequence of rollout activities within each post office
has been split into two separate programmes, the Infrastructure programme
and the User Awareness and Installation programme. The Infrastructure
programme covers the activities for each outlet from the issue of the regional
general manager letter through to completion of the site preparation activities
such that the outlet is ready for installation. The User Awareness and
Installation programme covers the Awareness/Training events for the outlet
staff, the installation of the counter equipment, the migration, acceptance and

the transition to steady state.

Rollout Phases
The defined phases of the rollout are as follows:

Phase 1 - Initial Go Live (Release 1a) installations

During September/October 1996, ten post office outlets in South Wales and
South West region had equipment installed to automate the payment of child
benefit by utilisation of the benefit payment card. The counter systems
installed utilised some hardware components which were specific to this
exercise and therefore not used in later phases of the rollout programme.
Only one counter position per post office outlet was installed.

Post offices in this phase were in the following BA Districts :

District BA District
Number I District Name
Ref
4.01 101307 _I Bristol Brunel

Phase 2 - Release 1b installations

The outlets identified to receive the Release 1b system are located in South
Wales and South West Region and North East Region. The Release 1b
system introduced the automation of the order book control system (OBCS).
These outlets had counter equipment installed between May 1997 and
September 1997. The number of outlets originally installed was 201. These
post offices, supplemented by those outlets undertaken in Phase 1 would
form approximately two thirds of the post offices required for the live trial.

Post offices in this phase were in the following BA Districts :

11.05 I 109001 I South
Tyneside

Phase 3 - IGL upgrades to Release 1c

Release 1c introduced support for benefit encashment and order book
control. The systems identified as part of Phase 1 were upgraded to target
hardware configurations and with the introduction of release 1c were able to
operate the order book control functionality in addition to the existing

3.1.4 Phase 4 - Release 1b upgrades to Release 1c

Phase 4 introduced release 1c to those post offices installed as part of Phase
2 and enabled these post offices to process child benefit encashment through
payment card, in addition to continuation of the order book control
functionality. The completion of this exercise introduced parity of software
release and hardware component configuration across all currently
automated post office outlets.

3.1.5 Phase 5 - Release 1c upgrades to New Release 2

This will be the introduction of Release 2 software to the post offices with
currently installed equipment. All installed counter systems will be upgraded
to new release 2 over a period of 2 to 4 weeks.

Phase 6 - New Release 2 new installations

This phase will introduce approximately 110 new post office outlets, in
addition to those installed in earlier phases. The outlets identified under
Phases 1 and 2 were largely smaller sub post offices. These additional
outlets will be larger sub post offices and branch offices, some of which will
have other automated equipment installed. These installations will take place
in the first two weeks of live trial.

Installation of new offices will be in the following BA Districts.

Phase 7 - National Rollout - initial start up ( 3 weeks )

The start of National Rollout will be undertaken at lower than the target beat
rate of 300 post offices per week, for a period of 3 weeks. Details of ramp up
tates and the associated BA Districts are detailed in Ref[1] and Ref[2].

Phase 8a - National Rollout Infratructure Programme

This phase is the environmental preparation of the post offices in readiness
for the installation of Horizon counter equipment. The infrastructure
programme is separate to the installation programme and completing post
offices within this programme ensures the post offices are RFI prior to
scheduling into Phase 8b. The infrastructure programme will begin well in
advance of the installation and awareness programme and look to create an
operating surplus of approximately 3000 offices. The activities which
constitute the infrastructure programme are defined in Ref[3]. Dates relating
to the infrastructure programme are defined in Ref[1].

Phase 8b - National Rollout - full rate

The continuing rollout of counter equipment at the target rate of 300 post
offices per week. This phase will utilise those post offices available to the
automation programme which are RFI and are available to be scheduled into
the awareness and installation programme at the appropriate point in
accordance with Ref[2]. Post offices which are not RFI will be scheduled at a
later time in accordance with re-availability of the post office and the
availability of the necessary POCL and ICL Pathway resources. Processes
for the management of “sundry” post offices which cannot be rescheduled into
this phase, will be detailed in lower level documents. The activities which
constitute the installation programme are defined in Ref[3]. Dates relating to
the installation and awareness programme are defined in Ref[2].

3.2 Implementation Programmes
ICL Pathway will manage the national rollout within four Implementation
Programmes. These Implementation Programmes map onto the post office
regions as detailed in Table 1 below.

Implementation Cycle

Following the implementation of approximately 200 post offices running
release 1b and the subsequent surveys and in some cases re-surveys in an
additional 450 post offices, it was apparent that a significant number of
outlets in the post office real estate required extensive site infrastructure
works to enable the installation of Horizon equipment. In order to undertake
this work and thus de-risk attaining and sustaining the prescribed national
rollout beat rate of 300 post offices per week, the implementation cycle has
been significantly revised. To manage the more volatile activities such as
survey, re-survey, preparation and modification and thus reduce the risk to
the 300 post offices per week installation beat rate, the original
implementation process has been segregated into two discrete and
independent programmes, namely

These two distinct programmes are separated by a minimum planning period
of 4 weeks to allow :

a) Scheduling of the post offices within an IBAD’s into implementation units
(IU’s) at the prescribed rate of 300 post offices per week.

a) Access arrangements to be made with outlet managers or their delegated
responsible individuals (DRI).

Where post offices are encountered which cannot be completed due to
external business related influences, these will be managed independently of
the main programme and thus potentially may contravene the defined
implementation cycle. The process for managing post offices such as these
will be detailed in a lower level document relating to the rescheduling
process.

A detailed definition of the implementation cycle is available in Ref[3]

3.4 Criteria for Implementation

reasonable endeavours will be made to ensure they are satisfied, these

criteria are not contractual and therefore do not have any penalties
associated where conformance cannot be achieved.

3.4.1 Rollout Criteria 1

In accordance with requirement 929, which relates to foreign encashment, all
nominated major post offices will be installed within the first 12 months of the
rollout. commencing (these post offices number approximately 1500
nationally).

3.4.2 Rollout Criteria 2

Within each Implementation Programme area, both the infrastructure and
installation and user awareness schedules will be phased by BA districts.
Schedules will then be further sub divided into implementation units (IU’s). An
implementation unit represents a logical grouping of post offices into a single
week of the rollout programme. IU’s will be scheduled into the infrastructure
programme for completion of the defined activities. The IU’s will then be
redefined and rescheduled into the user awareness and _ installation
programme. However, this scheduling process will ensure that requirement
972 is adhered to, namely :

e Installation will take place in major conurbations first (See Section 3.6)

e The M25 and Northern Ireland will be subject to separate rollout plans.
(See Criteria 5 and 6)

e The M25 rollout will take place during the second half of the overall
timetable. (See Criterion 6)

Reasonable endeavours will be taken to ensure sequencing of the
implementation activities is undertaken in the following order :

1. Completion of BA Districts that are part of the live trial requirement.

1. BA Districts will be undertaken consecutively normally bordering on
an already installed district.

The major conurbations will be completed first within specific implementation
programmes, however later completion of major conurbations in one or more
implementation programmes will not constrain the continuance of other
implementation programmes.

3.4.3 Rollout Criteria 3

Once the installations have commenced in a BA District then reasonable
endeavours will be made to complete the district using the following criteria:

1. > 90% of post offices in a BA District will be installed in 6 weeks in

90% of the districts.

1. In all BA Districts >50% of outlets in the district will be installed

excepting those BA Districts in which post offices have been installed to
satisfy criterion 1 and thus requirement 929.

Where offices are not available to be scheduled at the start of the
implementation cycle (e.g. due to planned relocation, major refurbishment
etc.), then these post offices will be scheduled at a time, later in the
programme, which allows effective utilisation of ICL Pathway’s and POCL’s
field based resources and does not conflict with the continuing rollout
programme. When post offices within a BA district which are not available for
scheduling have been identified, the remaining post offices are grouped into
an IBAD.

Rollout Criteria 4

All post offices which can be scheduled into IBADs, will be implemented in
one continuous programme with the exception of the major post offices, which
will be installed within the first 12 months of phase 8 commencing.

Rollout Criteria 5

Post Offices in Northern Ireland will be implemented as a separate
programme. The implementation of Northern Ireland will take place at the
earliest point within the scheduling of activities in Implementation Programme
1, while giving due consideration to the influencing activities within that IP,
namely

1. Utilisation of ICL Pathway’s and POCL’s field resources in
Implementation Programme 1 to avoid adverse weather conditions
in remote areas of Scotland

1. Scheduling of activities within the Province to avoid the constraining
effects of the Marching Season.

Rollout Criteria 6

The installation of the BA Districts that have post offices that operate the
ALPS system will commence in the second half of phase 8. Those BA districts
which constitute the “ALPS offices” are detailed in section 3.9 of this
document.

Rollout Criteria 7

Post offices in Implementation Programme 1 may finish earlier than the other
3 implementation programmes.

Rollout Criteria 8

Rollout activity will not be undertaken during the Christmas period. The
Christmas period will be no greater than 3 weeks duration and there will be a
maximum period of 3 weeks immediately prior to the Christmas period where
rollout activity will be undertaken at half rate. The Christmas period will be
deemed to have ended by the first working day of January of the New Year.
Rollout activities may be undertaken in post offices during this period by prior
agreement between ICL Pathway, the outlet manager, and the POCL Horizon
Implementation Manager. Notification of such agreements will be given to
CAPS.

Rollout Criteria 9

Following completion of the live trial from completion of the first installation of
national rollout, the installation and awareness phase of the rollout will be
achieved in 66 “rollout” weeks. A rollout week is a week in which installation
of counter equipment can be undertaken. This period therefore excludes the
period of non activity during one Christmas period.

3.4.10 Rollout Criteria 10

In accordance with Requirement 834, consideration will be given to the
implementation of parent and satellite post offices. Information maintained
within the rollout database details parent child relationships and therefore
policing will be achieve through that mechanism.

The overall sequence of BA Districts by Implementation Programme is
defined in Ref[1] and Ref[2]

Lists of post offices by BA District, due to be scheduled into the infrastructure
programme, will be generated and distributed to POCL regions 6 weeks prior
to activities starting in a single or the first of a series of BA Districts. These
will be in units of 4 weeks and could therefore span one or more BA districts.
Post offices not available to be automated will be highlighted by POCL
regions. The available post offices within a BA District(s) will therefore
constitute an IBAD. Information detailing office availability must be returned
by the POCL Regions, 3 weeks prior to the start of the infrastructure cycle for
those post offices. The post offices are then scheduled into implementation
units (IU’s) and schedule information issued to POCL and ICL suppliers from
the rollout database via the prescribed and agreed routes, 2 weeks prior to
the start of activities.

Outlets being scheduled for the installation will all be assumed to be
available, however contacting the post offices prior to the installation cycle
will determine this. Post offices not available at this point will be notified to
POCL Regions.

Completion of acceptance, following the installation and migration activities,
in all post offices on a given day of rollout activity, will be notified to BA by
midday on the day following installation, in accordance with requirement 945.
