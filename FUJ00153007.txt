Hi Penny
-he legal advice is that logs should be analysed for the whole of the false
accounting period. I have been informed that this is from December 06 to
December 07.

Of course, I‘ll help all I can.

Are you sure you need 12 months, Jon? It’s not just the retrieving, it’s the analysis
that will take the time (by Gareth) and frankly, I don’t think we will be able to
achieve this in the time left.

Penny, we need a massive favour that I'm sure will cost us quite a few cream cakes.

Is there anything you can do to pull out the stops to provide what Jon is looking for
within the timescales. Maureen will provide the necessary paper work on Monday.

Thank you for col

Mark

Jarnail has just telephoned me. and asked me to get transaction log data for the above
PO from 1st Dec 2006 to 31st December 2007. The logs need to be ordered through
our current process and then given to Gareth Jenkins at Fujitsu to analyse and
confirm by witness statement whether there are any errors within the Horizon system
for the transaction log period.

Jarnail would like the statement by Friday Sth March 2010.
