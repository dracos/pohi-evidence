Great!

Jane: please can we think about how we might position this with supportive MPs?
We should of course also start thinking about the lines we might prepare for BIS.

As this will also attract some media coverage we should think through a media plan - this is probably the
day to challenge the 90pc point.

Thanks Jane. What would be really helpful is if they could at least, in the event of a debate, ask some
sensible/balanced questions. B
