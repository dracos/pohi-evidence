POL00448207

Post Office is determined to reset its relationship with
postmasters and has introduced policies that set out guidelines
on how Post Office should support postmasters, specifically for
use across twelve areas.

The policies stand on their own but should be reviewed in
conjunction with each other. Support teams should have an
awareness of all twelve policies and how they link together.

The twelve Postmaster Support Policies are listed in section
2.2 of this policy and can be found on the hub, here.

1 Overview

1.1 Introduction

The Retail Engagement Director has overall accountability to the Post Office Board of Directors for
the design and implementation of a comprehensive operational Training package for postmasters*
and their teams. These training packages support branches in carrying out Post Office? transactions
via Horizon and associated operational processes accurately and confidently.

This policy is a non-contractual document provided for information. It does not form part of the
contract between any postmaster and Post Office.

1.2 Purpose

This policy is part of a framework established to capture the minimum operational training standards
required relating to: (i) the initial onboarding of postmasters and their teams; and (ii) ongoing
reinforcement and embedding of training procedures to enable proficiency in operating a branch /
operating Horizon.

It is one of a set of policies which provide a clear framework for Postmaster Onboarding. Compliance
with these policies supports the Post Office in meeting its business objectives and reponsibilities to

postmasters.

As many postmasters are limited companies or partnerships (and as individual postmasters may
appoint managers to operate a branch on their behalf) any steps that need to be taken by a
postmaster under this policy can be taken by someone authorised to act on that postmaster's behalf
(such as a director, partner or manager).

1.3 Core principles

Post Office are committed to providing comprehensive operational training to branch staff and are
committed to ensuring they feel confident when they conduct Post Office transactions and processes
using Horizon.

Post Office will provide training in good faith with fairness, transparency, and professionalism (being
the underpinning behaviours of Post Office). The training delivery team are trained, accredited and
quality assured to deliver Post Office operational training, compliantly and competently. No other
Post Office employees are authorised to complete any element of the Post Office Postmaster

Operational training.

1 In this policy, “postmaster” refers to a limited company, partnership, limited liability partnership, other entity or individual that
contracts with Post Office for the operation of a Post Office® branch.

? In this policy “Post Office” means Post Office Limited.

INTERNAL — Postmaster training policy V4.1 Page 4 of 27
POL00448207
POL00448207

* Post Office will offer a variety of training opportunities to postmasters, including eLearning
modules, in branch training and/or face to face classroom sessions, and will provide
additional support to postmasters in the form of operational guides, work aids and ‘How To’
demonstration videos available on Branch Hub and our Learning Management System,
access to an On-line help functionality on Horizon, and access to a Postmaster Operational
Training Catalogue for ongoing training and support needs.

* Postmasters are responsible for ensuring that branches are operated in accordance with all
applicable laws and regulations. To assist postmasters in remaining compliant and protecting
their customers, Post Office will monitor and review regulatory changes to products and
services so it can provide regular training to applicable branch staff.

*  Allnew postmasters will receive the full blended training package incorporating online e-
Learning to introduce them to the basics of Post Office products and services available in
their branches; Classroom training to consolidate learning gained and introduce the learners
to the Horizon system itself; and a variety of other key operational processes including, Post
Office accounting processes, cash management, security and compliance. Customer
conversations will also be covered. The In-branch training will build on and further embed the
learning from previous stages providing on the job training when new postmasters and
assistants start to complete live transactions for the first time.

* Absentee postmasters are responsible for ensuring the Officer in Charge/Manager/Nominee
receives the full training package.

* Post Office appreciates that a new Postmasters onboarding journey may be delayed or
postponed for a number of reasons. In these instances, the full training package will be
scheduled/re-scheduled to account for the delay and ensure the training is timely and the
Postmaster is not disadvantaged by knowledge/skill fade.

© Post Office will evaluate all training feedback received from postmasters and will take
relevant corrective action agreed.

1.4 Application

This Policy is applicable to all Post Office employees? and defines the minimum standards to control
financial loss, postmaster impact, regulatory breaches and reputational damage in line with the Post
Office's Risk Appetite. The policy sets out guidelines applicable to postmasters and their assistants
undertaking operational training.

3 In this Policy “employee” means permanent staff, temporary including agency staff, contractors, consultants and anyone else
working for or on behalf of Post Office and, for clarity, does not include postmasters or postmasters’ staff.

1.5 The risk

Post Office is committed to providing comprehensive training to all branch staff who require it.

Failure to do so could create the risk, to both Post Office and postmasters, that branch training

requirements are not met.

Section 2.5 sets out the required operational standards that the Post Office has implemented to

control this risk.

2 Risk appetite and required operational standards

2.1 Risk appetite

Risk appetite is the extent to which the Post Office will accept that a risk might happen in pursuit of
day-to-day business transactions. It therefore defines the boundaries of activity and levels of
exposure that Post Office is willing and able to tolerate.

Post Office takes its legal and regulatory responsibilities seriously and consequently has:
*  Averse risk appetite to risks around service and support provided to postmasters.
e  Averse risk appetite to being non-compliant with our statutory and regulatory obligations.

*  Averse risk appetite towards risks around our core operational processes that impact
postmasters.

*  Averse risk appetite for financial crime to occur within any part of Post Office or the network.

e Averse risk appetite in relation to unethical behaviour by Post Office employees.
*  Averse risk appetite to risks around disputes and litigation.

e Cautious risk appetite towards the risk of service interruptions that would considerably
reduce branch availability across the network resulting in the inability to serve customers.

Post Office acknowledges however that in certain scenarios even after extensive controls have been
implemented a risk may still sit outside the agreed Risk Appetite/Risk Tolerance. Risks outside of
Appetite/Tolerance may be presented to the relevant governance forums for escalation/agreement of
the risk position.

If a risk is identified which is outside of agreed policy a risk exception note will be required, details of
which can be found here.

2.2 Policy framework

This policy is part of a framework of postmaster support policies that has been established to set the
minimum operating standards relating to the management of postmaster contract! risks throughout
the business and network in line with Post Office's risk appetite. The framework includes the

following policies:
e Postmaster Onboarding
Postmaster Training (this policy)
e Postmaster Complaint Handling

* Network Monitoring and Branch Assurance Support

2.5 Policy required operational standards

A required operational standard defines the level of control that must be in place to manage inherent risks so that they remain within the defined Risk
Appetite statements. This section of the policy also sets out the Business Area(s) responsible for managing that risk through their controls, and all employees
must ensure that they comply with the policy requirements. There must be mechanisms in place within each business unit to demonstrate compliance. The
policy required operational standard can cover a range of control types, i.e., directive, detective, corrective and preventive which are required to ensure risks
are managed to an acceptable level and within the defined Risk Appetite.

The table below sets out the relationships between identified risk and the required policy operational standard in consideration of the stated risk appetite.

3 Procedures

3.1 Operational training

It is imperative that operational training is not confined to the initial onboarding of postmasters
and/or their assistants but that it is a continuous learning cycle. This will ensure that postmasters
and/or their teams continue to feel confident when conducting Post Office transactions and
processes using Horizon. In support of this, Post Office will provide comprehensive training packages
to support a blended learning approach, throughout the terms of the postmaster’s contract. There
might be occasions where the Area Manager feels the postmaster and/or their teams need further
training, this could be by accessing further eLearning modules, getting further support from an onsite
trainer or attending a refresher training course in a classroom environment. This would be a joint

decision with the postmaster.

The postmaster is responsible for ensuring branch staff put their learning into practice after the initial
onboarding training has taken place and is responsible for the branch staff's continuous learning
cycle. The postmaster may feel that they or their teams need further training on certain aspects of
the operation and if this is the case, the postmaster or branch manager can utilise the self-
registration option on Post Office online learning site or contact their Area Manager to discuss this
further. Alternatively, Area Managers or Business Support Managers may also identify a need for
further training and can arrange this by using the Microsoft form link which is sent each month by the
classroom trainers or by completing an intervention request.

A Post Office Operational Training Catalogue is available to postmasters and their staff via Branch
Hub and our Learning Management System which details all training options available. These options
include eLearning modules, classroom training, distance learning packs, ‘how to’ demonstration
videos and other additional training modules.

Should a Postmaster decide not to send their new branch staff on a classroom training course, then
the postmaster is responsible for ensuring the branch staff are inducted and trained. To support this,
Post Office would encourage postmasters to make use of learning resources available. We have
developed a ‘Postmaster guide to new starters’ document within the ‘helping you run your branch
folder’ which can be accessed on Branch Hub and provides guidance around areas to focus on.
Sections of the Operational Training Guide can also be downloaded to support with the in-branch
training of assistants. The helping you run your branch folder and the Operational Training Guide are

available to view and download from Branch Hub.

The learner process for new postmasters and (where requested) their assistants can be seen in
appendix one.

Post Office will offer the following training to new postmasters and their assistants, as needed. The
type of training differs depending upon the branch model type (Local or Main).

team at Suitability Assessment Stage. Due to the strict requirements in respect of using the portable
kit, any requests will be considered on a case-by-case basis.

Additional training available for all model types

On-site training support

Onsite trainers provide 6 days onsite training in the branch, starting on the first day of branch
operation. This training provides support to branches in the live environment and helps to embed the
knowledge and skills gained from the eLearning and classroom training.

They will also assist the branch staff with the first cash delivery and monthly balancing procedure. If
the monthly balance procedure falls outside the initial 6 days support, or scheduled follow up
balance, the on-site trainer will note this on the Branch Contact File and make the Business Support
Manager aware so that they can offer further support at the scheduled Trading Period balance.

Onsite trainers will also ensure that a demonstration of both inward and outward remittance
procedures (cash and stock) is completed as part of the training and the relevant Business Support
Manager will be informed of the need for additional early days support in these areas if any issues are
identified.

3.3 Scheduling of operational training

Operational training will be organised as follows:

* Training dates will be mutually agreed and scheduled once the agreement between Post Office
and the postmaster is signed (ie., the time at which the contract/appointment is confirmed).

*  Classroom/onsite training will be discussed with prospective postmasters or their staff (as
applicable) 6 weeks prior to go live for new branches.

e Incommercial transfer situations, the scheduling team will aim to contact incoming postmasters
within 7 days of receipt by Post Office of the signed contract.

¢ Atthe point of being booked onto the classroom training, attendees will be registered through
the Learning Management System to enable them to access the eLearning material online. This
should be at least 14 days before the classroom, to allow sufficient time for completion.

* The relevant branch learners will attend the classroom training as listed in section 3.1 (such
training is specific to the branch model).

* Once the classroom course is completed, the attendees will have a debrief session with the
classroom trainer to discuss learning outcomes.

e Branch learners will receive in-branch support and training from the Onsite trainer for 6 days
starting on the first day of branch operation.

3.4 Training exceptions

Post Office is committed to providing all necessary training and support to a new Postmaster
ensuring they are able to operate their branch to a high standard and can do so safely, legally, and
compliantly, therefore there are very few exceptions to the full training package. Permitted
exceptions are detailed below:

*  Pluralist postmasters who have already completed all elements of training at their existing
branches do not need to complete the Online e-Learning or Classroom training when taking on a
new Post Office branch.

e It will not be necessary to complete relevant online e-Learning if it has been fully completed
within the preceding six months.

e Anew Postmaster will be able to bypass classroom and/or in-branch training before their Post

Office goes live where fully trained staff are transferring across to the new Postmaster and
he/she has fully completed all Online e-Learning. The new Postmaster will be required to attend

INTERNAL — Postmaster training policy V4.1 Page 19 of 27
POL00448207

POL00448207

his/her classroom training within 4 weeks of their Post Office go live and this must be scheduled
before the exception is raised.

All incidents of exceptions relating to this policy will be reviewed and monitored.

3.5 Process of raising an exception to the training package

The full training package is explained at Suitability Assessment stage and the Business Support
Manager captures the Potential new Postmasters commitment to this. This is documented on the
Office Information Sheet and submitted to the Onboarding/scheduling team.

If the Business Support Manager recognises that one of the three exceptions apply, they will raise the
exception to the Regional Lead Training Manager via email. The Regional Lead Training Manager will
consider each exception on a case-by-case basis and will respond by email providing an explanation
for any declined exceptions and an approval reference number for those approved.

The Business Support Manager will annotate the Office Information Sheet with details of the exception
and approval reference number.

The scheduling team will follow the instructions on the Office Information Sheet and schedule the
training accordingly.

Post Office appreciates that a Postmasters circumstance may change following the Suitability
Assessment and in instances where one of the three exceptions later applies the Business Support
Manager will seek approval from the Regional Lead Training Manager. If the exception is approved the
Business Support Manager will document this in an email and re-submit an updated Office Information
Sheet to the scheduling team. The scheduling team will schedule/re-schedule the updated training
requirements.

The Regional Lead Training Managers decision is final, and the Regional Lead Training Managers will
maintain records of all escalated exceptions, approved and declined.

In the absence of a Regional Lead Training Manager the Business Support Manager may escalate their
exception to the Head of Training and Delivery via email.

If there is an exception request outside of the three examples in 3.4, this will be escalated directly to
the Head of Postmaster Training and Delivery and the Retail Engagement Director, who will make a
decision and request a Policy Exception note should the exception be granted.

4 Where to go for help

4.1 Additional policies

This policy is one of a set of policies. The full set of policies can be found on the SharePoint Hub
under Postmaster Support Policies.

4.2 How to raise a concern

Any postmaster, any postmaster’s staff or any Post Office employee who suspects that there is a
breach of this Policy should report this without any undue delay.

If a postmaster or any postmaster's staff are unable to raise the matter with the area manager of the
relevant branch or if a Post Office employee is unable to speak to her or his line manager, any person
can bring it to Post Office’s attention independently and can use the Speak Up channels for this
purpose. Any person can raise concerns anonymously, although disclosing as much information as
possible helps ensure Post Office can conduct a thorough investigation.

For more details about how and where to raise concerns, please refer to the current Speak Up Policy
