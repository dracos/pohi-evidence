Subject: RE: Key Agenda Items for Upcoming Board Meeting **Final Version**

Hi both,
See below the finatversiorrofthe notefor the board, are you happy with this?

Speak at 9am.

Dear Chairman,

I trust this message finds you well. As we prepare for the upcoming board meeting, I wish to draw
your attention to several critical matters demanding prompt consideration and discussion.

Confidential Email on Project Pineapple: As you are aware It has come to my attention that Nick's
confidential email on Project Pineapple which was sent to the individuals involved needs resolving
my email response remains unanswered since my communication on Thursday evening.

Suspended Historic Employees: The presence of employees previously identified as high risk in the
historic scandal within our workforce raises concerns. A comprehensive review of all personnel
involved in the scandal is imperative to safeguard the integrity of our business. I recommend swift
action to mitigate potential risks. How was Brian Trotter still in the business until we visited the
inquiry? Regarding Steve Bradshaw I mentioned him to four individuals in the business on four
different occasions and a board regarding his testimony which would cause our business further
issues however, once again I was ignored.

Disbandment of PM Engagement Team: this team lacks credibility and has delivered on the
challenges faced by the PM community hence they have no respect within the wider network. I
suggest the strategic disbandment of the team. This recommendation is reinforced by their
reluctance to conduct a survey when outcomes were not anticipated in their favour. Granting the new
oversight committee control over forums and PM engagement is essential for us to be effective and
PM-centric.

Investigation of NDAs: A thorough investigation into all Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs)
executed since CEO Nick assumed office is crucial. During the select committee hearing, Nick was
asked if he was aware of any such agreements and he advised No, it is crucial we are transparent
with the select committee but also to protect our CEO with accurate information, can we investigate
this?

Additionally, urgent steps are required to revoke NDAs with external entities, such as Fujitsu or
Second Sight, linked to the Horizon scandal. This decision should be communicated to the public
promptly to show we as a board want to help with justice for postmasters and the inquiry.

Role of Legal Council (Ben Foat): Our proposal is a comprehensive review and adjustment of the job
role for Ben Foat, our Legal Counsel, this involves reassigning him to the inquiry and limiting his
involvement in other business areas. This adjustment is fundamental for reinforcing transparency
and accountability and changing our culture and indecision.

Culture: Postmaster discrimination must end immediately, this rhetoric that they are all on the take
and are the same is unacceptable. What Richard was caught saying is common within the walls of
POL, the language used by employees can’t be spoken about Black people, Muslims or Jews because
it's discriminatory. The CRO informing the board of extreme stories again is unhelpful and lacks
integrity but then wants PMs to pay 100% for automation and not strategic partners. The culture in
this business is toxic and it needs more PMs involved in the entire organisation to help it refocus.

Establishment of Oversight Committee: In light of the evolving landscape, I recommend the
immediate establishment of an oversight committee ASAP featuring Postmasters and NEDs as its
core members. This committee must be empowered with clearly defined terms of reference anda
mandate to proactively take action and ensure accountability among stakeholders. Defining clear
terms of reference for the committee is essential to challenging cultural and procedural aspects of
the organisation. The establishment of such a committee has been strongly advocated for by the
voice of postmasters, the National Federation of SubPostmasters (NFSP), and existing Postmaster
NEDs.

To ensure the effective operation of the committee and align with the business's goal of becoming
postmaster-centric, it is imperative to grant existing Postmaster NEDs an additional term. Their
continued involvement is vital for the success of the committee and the realisation of our aspiration
to be postmaster-focused and ensure our business never has untouchable employees and the
lessons of the past are learnt and changes are made to ensure these never happen again.

Furthermore, in filling the upcoming NED vacancy, we recommend considering the inclusion of
another experienced postmaster. This strategic move will enhance the committee's expertise and
contribute to its effectiveness in guiding the business toward a postmaster-centric model.

I appreciate your attention to these matters and eagerly anticipate addressing them collectively
during our scheduled board meeting.
