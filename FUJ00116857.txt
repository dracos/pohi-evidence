Royal Mail Holdings plc

Chairman’s Statement
“A robust and improved performance in the face of real economic and market challenges”

In the few months since I joined Royal Mail, I have been struck by the passion and commitment of people throughout the Company - to.
our customers and to the future success of the Company. The people I've met are keenly aware of the important role which our services
play in daily life in all parts of the country. That drive to serve customers as best we can and the energy and determination our people
bring to their jobs continue to be important assets as we go forward and I am determined to support and develop it

Postal services are facing an unprecedented level of competition from electronic communications around the developed world. The
average household spends just 50p a week on postage, a fraction of the amount spent on telephony and internet services, Yet the
internet is also providing real growth opportunities as more goods are ordered online and while letter volumes are falling, our postmen
and women have never delivered more packets and parcels. That trend will continue but it remains fundamentally important that we
continue to be able to deliver any letter, posted anywhere in the UK, to any other address in the UK. We remain determined to provide a
one-price-goes-anywhere Universal Service open to all, large and small customers - for without it, we will not be able to provide the
services needed and relied on by the business customers who post the bulk of all mail and parcels, and who provide most of our
revenues. Modernising and transforming Royal Mail is, we are certain, crucial to preserving the Universal Service

We know too the cherished role that Post Office branches play in communities large and small. Post Office Limited has been rolling out a
new product or service on average every three months and its new revenues are helping sustain the branch network. The business has
already taken big steps on its road to long-term sustainability, a goal that looks closer in the light of these most recent results.
Maintaining a network of branches within good reach of its customers nationwide will continue to be a key objective.

I am fortunate to be joining a Company that has performed well in the face of the recession and intensifying competition. The future will
not be easy. But the progress we have made and continue to deliver gives me confidence as we tackle the challenges that lie ahead.

I welcome the analysis of the Postal Services Sector by Richard Hooper and his colleagues whose review recommended measures
including:

© Regulatory change to reflect the broader communications market in which Royal Mail now operates;

« — That the Government should tackle the historic pension deficit to allow the benefits of modernisation to flow through to our
customers;

+ Access to private capital to allow us to continue to modernise while protecting the Universal Service and grow our parcels
operations to help offset the decline in traditional mail

As we continue to accelerate our transformation, we are working closely with the Government to find a resolution to all these issues to
enable Royal Mail to secure a strong and vibrant future, allowing us to continue to deliver a high quality, affordable six-days-a-week
Universal Service to customers throughout the UK. Furthermore, the Board is fully aware of the Government's plan to introduce a partner
into the equity of the Company and has been co-operating fully in this process.

I would like to thank all those who have contributed to the success of the Company so far including David Fish who left the Board in
September 2008 after almost 6 years. It goes without saying that the recovery in the performance of the Company owes much to the
leadership of Allan Leighton during his tenure as Chairman. There is no doubt that everyone owes him a considerable debt and on behalf
of the Board I thank Allan for all his achievements.

Royal Mail Holdings plc

Chief Executive's Statement

Royal Mail Group and its people made real progress in 2008-09 with operating profit rising from £162 milllion to £321 million, the vast
majority of mail was delivered at or ahead of target, and a raft of modernisation and efficiency measures implemented ranging from the
roll-out of handheld tracking devices to the successful upgrading of automated sorting equipment. Competitive pressures intensified, with
almost ten million fewer letters a day being handled than just three years ago, but the transformation of the business is well underway
and on track to ensure it has the modern operation key to its future.

The Group's performance came in the face of the worst economic conditions in more than half a century, along with unprecedented
competition from electronic media, but Royal Mail Group's results stand in contrast to those of other major postal administrations. The
Group's performance in the face of such difficult market conditions underlines the effort and hard work by our people and the long
journey we have taken from the time, seven years ago, when the business was losing more than £1 million a day and failing most of its
quality targets to the position today where it is profitable and meeting quality targets.

However real challenges remain

The need for fairer regulation that reflects the market in which we now operate.

Mail volumes are predicted to decline by around 10% this year due to competition from electronic communications and the
economic downturn - with every 11 decline costing £70m in revenue

The pension fund deficit has more than doubled from £2.9 billion last year to £68 billion in accounting terms with the actuarial
valuation also likely to have increased very significantly when it is revalued later this year.

Cashflow is now negative as we step up our spending on modernising and transforming the business

The need to accelerate still further the modernisation of the mails business so that we can offset the challenges we face and
continue to provide our customers with an affordable and high quality Universal Service.

Key performance highlights in 2008-09:

Post Office Limited 908 914 4a (34)
Other businesses 54 36 86 71
Group 9,560 9,388 321 162

Overall Group revenue increased by almost 2% to £9,560 million despite the recession
The Group made an operating profit of £321 million - a 98% improvernent on 2007-08 performance.

All four Group businesses are in full-year profit for the first time in two decades - with Royal Mail Letters and the Post Office
both moving from loss the previous year into profit

There was strong progress in modernising the Letters business and improving its efficiency in both deliveries and in sorting the
mail. Along with our people's commitment and dedication to customers, this helped the business to hit almost all its quality
targets.

Post Office Limited saw strong growth in Financial Services, and now has around two million customers for these services, while
the award of a new contract for the Post Office Card Account underpinned the branch network's role in the provision of cash to
millions of customers.

‘There was an underlying 1.2% revenue increase in Post Office Limited and, when the annual £150 million Social Network
Payment to support loss-making Post Office branches is taken into account, the business made a £41 milllion profit compared
to a loss the previous year of £34 million - a £75 million improvement.

GLS's revenue and profit both benefitted from the strengthening of the euro against Sterling. However, underlying profit
declined by £10 million as trading got tougher in the second half of the year - in spite of an underlying revenue growth of £36
million (2.4%) when the impact of the beneficial exchange rate was excluded.

Parcelforce Worldwide grew its revenues in the face of the economic recession and increased its efficiency, achieving a 57.5%
increase in operating profit to £12 million. It also improved customer quality of service with a 97.5% performance achievement.
However margins remain under severe pressure in an exceptionally tough market.

Royal Mail Holdings plc

Chief Executive's Statement (continued)
Despite our improving performance we need to tackle some strategic and market challenges:

© There is an urgent need to tackle the escalating legacy pension fund deficit so that the financial benefits of modernisation and
greater efficiency can flow through to our customers in the form of better services rather than being absorbed by unsustainable
payments into a volatile fund.

© Although overall revenue rose in 2008-09, in Royal Mail Letters it fell by £123 million - nearly 2% - despite postage price rises
in April 2008 averaging around 5%. This income fall was largely driven by a fall in mail volumes of 5.5% - a steep increase on
the 3.2% fall the previous year.

© The average daily mailbag now holds just over 75 million letters, packets and parcels compared to 84 million three years ago in
2006, with e-substitution driving much of the loss as more customers switch from letters to email and the web.

© The exceptionally tough economic climate and the structural change in the way people and businesses communicate mean that
volumes are likely to decline by up to 10% in 2009-10 as businesses - which send around 90% of all mail - tighten their belts.
Revenue has also continued to suffer from downtrading as customers switch from premium products like First Class to lower-
priced services

© Although volumes in the overall mail market are falling, competitors have increased their own mail volumes with almost one in
three of all letters now being collected and trunked by rivals before being presented to Royal Mail to deliver over the final mile
under the business's access arrangements. The volume of this access mail rose by 30% last year ~to 5.3 billion items - and
Royal Mail continues to lose money on every item of this mail because of the uneconomic price we have to charge under the
current regulatory framework

© The one-price-goes-anywhere Universal Postal Service which involves collection of any stamped letter posted in any of our
114,000 postboxes for delivery under our six-days-a week service to the UK's 28 million addresses - made a loss for the first.
nine months of the year of around £100 million’. We know that completing our modernisation plans in the Letters business is
essential in order to secure the future of this vital service which only Royal Mail provides.

© Cashflow is now negative with a cash outflow in the year of £373 million driven by continued investment in our operations and
payments into the pension funds. Total cash paid into the pension funds in the year was £823 million. The pension reforms
introduced in Apri 2008 and the change in market conditions had a materially beneficial effect at the operating profit level.

Royal Mail Letters - accelerating modernisation
Our strategy in Royal Mail Letters is.
* Maximise profitable revenue by meeting customer needs through innovation and efficiency
* Deliver market-leading quality of service
* Be the UK's lowest-cost operator with world-class productivity through investment in a modernised environment
* Deliver change through engaged, flexible and competitively paid people.

Good progress was made in 2008-09 on the drive to modernise the Letters business and expand its capabilities to improve service to
customers. As part of the 2007 funding deal, Royal Mail was provided with £1.2 billion of loan facilities from Government and we have
already invested around £800 million since 2006-07, with almost £400 million spent on capital expenditure during the year. Going
forward we will fully utilise the Government financing as we invest a further £2 billion in modernising the business, The work underway
includes

* — 27,000 handheld tracking devices were issued to Royal Mail drivers to record an electronic signature on delivery of Special
Delivery and other tracked mail. The rollout in 2008 created one of the UK's biggest corporate WiFi networks and hundreds of
thousands of items a day are now being tracked using the technology, which can provide the sender confirmation of delivery
within 20 minutes after the mail is signed for at the doorstep.

The upgrade of 138 Integrated Mail Processors was completed in mail centres nationwide to improve the equipment's
performance. Work has now started on building extensions to up to 90 machines to expand further its sorting capabilities

* The first “intelligent” Letter Sorting Machine ~ the forerunner of a new generation of automated sorting equipment ~ has been
installed at the Jubilee mail centre in Kingston in Surrey and orders have been placed for a further 75 machines.

After extensive consultations with our people, as well as with local authorities and MPs, the closure of 11 mail centres was
announced last year and plans are well advanced to move the work to other more efficient centres as well as to build two new
ones.

«The first walk sequencing machines - which can sort the mail sequentially to the route taken by a postman or woman - were
installed in Bristol in preparation for a rollout to the rest of the delivery network. The workplans for over 34,000 walks have
now been revised, resulting in efficiency gains

* Within three years we will have 900 sophisticated automation machines and we will be able to sort 75% of addressed letters to
the exact door-to-door sequence in which our postmen and women deliver - compared to the legacy 600 machines which have
much more limited capability

‘Full year figures for the Universal Service loss will be published in the Regulatory Financial Statements by the end of this July.

Royal Mail Holdings plc

Chief Executive's Statement (continued)

We are already half way through our modernisation, but given the sharp downturn in the postal market and the difficult economic
conditions, we clearly need to accelerate our transformation plan. The scale of modernisation Royal Mail is going through makes it more
important than ever that we engage with our people and the trade unions we work with to secure a real commitment to change on the
ground - and to ensure the Company has a strong future in the competitive market while at the same time protecting the one-price-
goes-anywhere Universal Service.

Post Office - growing new business

The Post Office in 2008-09 ended the uncertainty over the future size of its network with a commitment to do everything possible to
avoid further branch closures. It also moved into profitability after almost a decade of losses.

«The business continued to generate new income from Financial Services provided through its successful joint venture with the
Bank of Ireland, and also from its telephony services, crucial to offset the decline in its traditional business. By the end of the
financial year, over two million customers had chosen one of the Post Office's new savings or insurance products.

+ Refurbishment of Crown branches - which handle around 15% of Post Office business - got underway with the innovations in
selected branches including open plan counter layouts, queue management systems with customers being given a numbered
ticket on arrival and dedicated areas for the sale of Financial Services products.

* Working with the subpostmasters who run the large majority of branches, 4,500 more Paystations were installed, bringing the
total to 12,500, allowing customers visiting the shops in sub offices to pay bills outside the normal Post Office opening hours

* The Post Office's free-to-use ATM network has expanded with 400 machines installed this year bringing the total to almost
1,700 ATMs in place at Post Office branches around the country.

«The focus on mails business - the single biggest source of revenue in branches - was increased with trials of the Fast Drop and
Business Point service in selected branches and 41 Post & Go machines were installed, allowing customers to weigh parcels
and print a postage label without going to a counter position

«The Network Change programme to implement the Government's decision on the closure of some 2,500 branches was
completed, providing a network going forward of 11,500 branches along with 500 new Outreach services.

The future

Despite the pressures facing the whole of the Company, Royal Mail Group’s robust performance - in both financial and quality terms ~
shows it is making good progress in building the base on which it cannot just withstand the pressures of recession and competition, but
also provide the modern, transformed and efficient operations so crucial for a successful future. Royal Mail is getting on with
modernisation. The Post Office is earning new revenues from new services and is working hard to maintain its current size which is
providing access to a Post Office branch within a three miles radius for 99% of the population. GLS and Parcelforce Worldwide continue to
be profitable and win new business in the face of intense competition. In a few years’ time we predict that half Royal Mail's overall
Tevenues and 75% of its profits will come from parcel and packet services, driven by the real opportunities of e-commerce and fulfilment.

The huge effort to modernise the Letters business provides the best opportunity to secure the future of the Universal Service. And as
Royal Mail remains convinced that a Universal Service - that only we have both the willingness and means to provide ~ is essential for a
thriving and flourishing mails market, we will continue to do all we can to protect and nurture this key service on which the whole country
depends.

Critical to our success is working with our shareholder, the Government. to find the right solution to the issues already identified in the
review of the industry by Richard Hooper - the need for fairer regulation, a resolution to the escalating legacy pension fund deficit, and
timely and flexible access to capital

The year past has been an important one and the year ahead will be no less so. The challenges from the difficult and uncertain markets in
which we operate remain, but we have the funding and the determination to continue our journey to transformation. Our vision, fully
achievable with our continued commitment and progress on modernisation, remains: to be demonstrably the world’s best postal company.

General Logistics Systems - further expansion
Royal Mail's European business, General Logistics Systems (GLS), continued to grow and develop its operations as the “Quality leader in
European parcels logistics”. GLS provides reliable, high quality parcel services, logistics and express services throughout Europe

Through its own start-up companies, acquisitions and its network partners, GLS has created a strong European network providing
customers with services in 36 European states.

In August 2008, two new franchise areas were acquired in Belluno and Padua - increasing the number of GLS managed depots in Italy to
28. In May 2008 a network partnership agreement with MNG Kargo in Turkey was implemented and in August 2008 a global partnership
agreement with TF Logistics in Hong Kong was signed with immediate effect.

In addition to the investments in the physical network, the continuing development of information technology remains an area of specific
focus. GLS's European parcel shops, where private or commercial customers can take parcels for delivery or pick them up, increased by
more than 300 to 6,703 outlets.

GLS's network now comprises 32 central transhipment points and 680 depots, providing services through wholly owned and partner
companies in 36 European states. A workforce of over 13,000 people and nearly 19,700 vehicles deliver 350 million parcels annually for

Operating and Financial Review

Introduction

Royal Mail Holdings ple (the Company) is a public limited company wholly owned by the UK Government. It became a plc on 26 March
2001. The framework for change was the Postal Services Act 2000 that created a commercially focused company with a more strategic
relationship with the Government. Royal Mail Holdings ple together with its subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures comprise ‘the Group
The Group operates within a regulatory framework comprising of an independent Regulator, Postcomm and Consumer Focus, a newly
established statutory consumer organisation.

Royal Mail Group encompasses a set of trusted brands and companies that combine the best of a public service ethos, with the commercial
requirement to operate effectively in the highly competitive communications and fulfilments markets. Through our brands we reach
everyone in the UK by way of our mail, parcels and express services together with our Post Office branches.

GLS

Geneva Logistics Systems

The Group has made significant progress since 2003, turning the businesses around from operating loss making entities to profitable
businesses, whilst improving quality of service. This has been achieved against a background of full market liberalisation in January 2006.
However, the Group is facing major challenges including volume decline in mails, an unsustainable pension deficit and an unprofitable
universal service obligation (USO). On 16 December 2008, Richard Hooper published his independent review of the UK postal services
sector (the "Hooper Report’), highlighting the key issues facing the universal service and the inability of present policies to ensure its
survival. He noted the only company capable of providing the USO in the UK is Royal Mail

The Hooper Report proposed a package of recommendations including.

. ‘a new regulatory regime to place postal regulation within the context of the broader communications market:

. a solution to the historic pension plan deficit to enable the Company and its customers to reap the benefits of modernisation;
and

. a strategic partnership between Royal Mail and one or more private sector partners to provide capital, commercial confidence

and corporate experience in transforming a network business.
The Group's strategic vision is to become an efficient world class operator of the mails universal service in the UK, and a true customer
champion in the UK and European parcels markets. Within the context of an industry undergoing major structural change, the Group has
six strategic objectives to deliver its vision:
be increasingly focused on delivering customer needs and becoming the customer champion in its markets:
develop an efficient world-class universal service in the UK;
develop a leading role in the growing fulfilment market across Europe;
provide integrated solutions to customers through an expanded presence across the supply chain;
continue to develop green solutions for customers consistent with overall approach to corporate social responsibility; and
achieve efficient retail distribution primarily through the network of Post Office outlets.

Operating and Financial Review (continued)

Governance
The EU Accounts Modernisation Directive (AMD) applies for all medium and large EU companies including listed companies and requires a
mandatory inclusion to the existing Directors’ Report to provide an enhanced review of a company’s business.

The Directive states that the review should provide a balanced and comprehensive analysis of the development, performance and position
of the Company's business, including the principal risks and uncertainties facing the organisation. The analysis should include both financial
and, where appropriate, non-financial KPls relevant to the particular business including information relating to environmental and
employee matters. It is recognised that to the extent that this information appears in the Operating and Financial Review (OFR), it is
incorporated by reference into the Directors’ Report.

Our Pension Schemes

Royal Mail Group Ltd is the sponsoring employer for the Royal Mail Pension Plan and Royal Mail Senior Executives Pension Plan (both
defined benefit schemes), and for the Royal Mail Retirement Savings Plan and the Royal Mail Defined Contribution Plan (both defined
contribution schemes). Based on assets, the Royal Mail Pension Plan is one of the largest pension schemes in the UK. The assets and
liabilities of the defined benefit schemes, as measured under accounting standards, are reported as a net pension deficit in the Group
balance sheet. The gross assets and liabilities and the net deficit are significantly larger than any of the Group's other assets and liabilities.
This results in the Group being one of the most exposed UK corporates to pension scheme volatility, particularly with respect to
movements in equity values and bond rates.

Funding
Royal Mail Group Ltd

Royal Mail Group Ltd is facing considerable cash requirements with respect to its investment in plant and equipment and funding its
worsening pension deficit at a time when the market has been opened up to full competition

On 23 March 2007, a funding package totalling £1.2bn up until 2016 was completed with Government and for which State Aid approval
was received in April 2009. The £900m senior debt facility expires in March 2014. It has been assumed that another facility will be

negotiated to be available at this time.

In making an assessment on Royal Mail Group Ltd's ability to continue as a going concern, the directors have assumed the successful
execution of the transformation plan which is reflected in the detailed 5 year business plan approved by the Board. There are a number
of uncertainties in relation to the funding and headroom requirements which are set out in Note 2 Accounting policies.

If risks in relation to the business plan materialise, the Directors have identified a portfolio of operational and strategic actions that could

be taken to mitigate any headroom exposures.

Post Office Limited

As part of the funding package announced in May 2007, the Group received £152m during the year (2008 £313m) under the Industrial
Development Act 1982, to compensate Post Office Limited for the other net costs of providing certain specified “services of general
economic interest”. An additional £150m (2008 £150m) was paid to Post Office Limited during the year to fund the maintenance of a
social network of post offices, which was recorded within revenue as a Social Network Payment

Both of the above payments made during the year were in accordance with approval received from the European Commission under

relevant State Aid rules.

Operating and Financial Review (continued)

Group Financial Analysis

In the following analysis, all references to operating profit are before exceptional items.

This year we report an operating profit of £321m compared to £162m for 2008, an increase of £159m (98.1%). This was driven by the
strong performance of all four business units, all reporting an operating profit for the first time in almost 20 years. Royal Mail and Post
Office Limited have both delivered significantly improved performance year on year, returning to profitability, despite falling revenues
driven by difficult trading conditions

Operating profit by business unit - £m

ess unit - £m

“The impact ofthe diference in FX rates year on year was £20m favourable in GLS

External Revenue

Group external revenue increased by £172m (1.8%) from £9,388m to £9,560m in 2009. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange (FX) in
GLS, this drove an underlying decline of £55m. However, when also excluding the impact of a lower number of working days year on
year, revenue is broadly flat. Increases in GLS, Parcelforce and other businesses (mainly iRed and Romec), were offset by declining
revenues in Royal Mail and POL.

Royal Mail revenue outturned £123m lower, and even after adjusting for working days, has continued to decline year on year. A price
increase of c.5% on the regulated area did not counter accelerated volume decline, further losses to competition and customers continuing
to switch to lower priced products.

General Logistics Systems increased its revenue by £263m (21.32), from £1,232m to £1,495m, largely driven by the strengthening of the
euro. The remaining underlying growth was attributable to higher domestic and export parcel revenues. Parcelforce Worldwide increased
its revenue by £20m (5.3%) to £399m, due to income growth in UK retail and export channels. Post Office Limited showed a revenue
decrease of £3m (0.4%) from £911m to £908m, with all income streams impacted by a smaller network and an additional 53" week in
the prior year. Revenue decline in Government Services and Retail income was largely offset by growth in Telephony and Financial
Services income streams

Costs (excluding exceptional items)

Total costs of £9,286m, have increased from £9,273m by £13m (0.1%). However, removing the impact of the exchange rate difference
year on year, costs show an underlying decrease of £194m (2.1%). Costs will have been higher in the prior year due to the impact of the
additional 53" week in 2008

Cost by type - % Cost growth by type - £m

People costs of £6,012m represent 65% of the Group's cost base, and have fallen year on year by £244m (4.1%). In 2008, people costs
comprised 67% of the cost base. The decrease is driven by reduced pension costs and management of headcount, which has fallen by
c.5,000 in the wholly owned UK subsidiaries, principally within Royal Mail and Post Office Limited. Agents’ costs are significantly lower
year on year as a result of the network transformation programme.

Distribution and conveyance costs comprise 17% of the Group's cost base and have increased by £99m to £1,577m. This is largely as a
result of higher international volumes and average weight, combined with higher costs associated with settling with overseas postal
operators, including the impact of foreign exchange. Other operating costs make up 18% of total costs for the Group and have fallen by
£49m, to £1,697m. Tight cost control measures including renegotiation of key supplier contracts have delivered efficiencies enabling
inflationary pressures to be absorbed and savings to be delivered that offset the additional costs of investment in our transformation.

Quadrant Catering Limited our catering associate, Post Office Limited's financial services associate (Midasgrange Limited) and G3
Worldwide N.V. (Spring)- our international mail distribution associate.

Net Exceptional Items

Net exceptional items of £138m (2008 £383m) comprise operating exceptionals of £149m (2008 £441m) offset in part by profits from
property disposals of £11m (2008 £58m). Operating exceptional costs include £113m for restructuring costs (2008 £363m), £84m for
ColleagueShare costs (2008 £277m), £77m for impairments (2008 £97m) and £27m for other exceptional write offs (2008 £17m). This
was offset in part by Government grant income of £152m (2008 £313m) received to compensate Post Office Limited for providing certain
specified “services of general economic interest”

ColleagueShare Scheme
The Company ColleagueShare scheme has now completed a second year. The costs of the scheme are treated as an operating exceptional
iter.

Fully eligible employees were allocated an additional 303 notional shares in the Company during the year following the issue of 408
notional shares in the first year of the scheme. The value of the ColleagueShares is based on the regularly updated Group share value

plan model, In the year the scheme has generated a discounted charge to the income statement of £14m (2008 £116m) in exceptional
items and a further £8m, relating to the unwinding of discounts from the first year of the scheme for ColleagueShares, in finance costs

The provision in the balance sheet for share payments at the end of the scheme is now £134m. In line with the rules of the scheme all
ColleagueShares will be redeemed by the Company by 2012

The Company will again be making a related stakeholder dividend payment representing a payment of up to £400 to all eligible
employees in recognition of achieving certain Group and business unit targets. The total charge to the income statement in exceptional
items arising from the stakeholder dividend is £70m (2008 £161m) payable in 2009.

Net Finance Costs

Net finance costs of £20m (2008 £13m income) comprises finance costs of £56m (2008 £71m) offset by finance income of £36m (2008
£84m). The decrease in finance income of £48m is mainly due to lower investment yields (particularly on index linked gilts within the
escrow portfolio of investments), lower investment volumes in Group excluding POL, partially offset by higher investment volumes in Post.
Office Limited and higher interest receivable within General Logistics Systems.

The decrease in finance costs of £15m is mainly due to lower borrowing rates partially offset by the first year unwinding of discounts on
ColleagueShares

Net pensions interest
Net pensions interest charge of £114m (2008 £134m interest credit), a non-cash item for the Group, has increased by £245m mainly
due to the increase in expected interest on Plan liabilities as a result of the increase in the discount rate.

Taxation

The taxation charge in the income statement of £278 comprises £m current tax payable with respect to UK operations, a £35m
current tax charge on overseas profits, a UK deferred tax charge of £237m and an overseas deferred tax charge of £5m. A tax charge of,
£192m was taken directly to equity, Last year a taxation credit of £212m was recorded comprising £25m current tax credit with respect
to UK operations, a £29m current tax charge on overseas profits, a £226m UK deferred tax credit and a £10m overseas deferred tax
charge, with a charge of £18m being taken directly to equity. The tax charge reported in relation to the pre-tax profit is mainly due to the
decreased amount of deferred tax asset recognised

respect of GLS projects. The expenditure was offset by inflows of £20m (2008 £71m) from surplus property disposals.

Acquisition and sale of financial assets of £5m outflow (2008 £61m) represents the net purchase of investments made by the Group from
cash and cash equivalent resources and comprises £19m outflow relating to the investments in escrow, provided as security for the Royal
Mail Pension Plan, offset by the sale of £14m financial assets used for liquidity within the Group.

Net drawdown/(repayment) of borrowings and financing of £310m inflow (2008 £33m) principally comprises £300m drawdown (2008

Limited, £75m cash received (2008 £55m) on sale and leasebacks, offset by £18m payment (2008 £3m) of finance lease obligations.

Provisions

Provisions at the end of March 2009 were £310m (2008 £411m). The £101m net reduction comprises cash spend of £220m and
transfers to short-term pension creditors of £32m, offset in part by new provisions relating to ColleagueShares, restructuring and
onerous property contracts of £143m and the unwinding of the ColleagueShare provisions discount of £87.

Operating and Financial Review (continued)

Treasury Management

The Group operates a central Treasury function that manages £1.1bn of financial asset investments (substantially all of which are now
held in escrow in favour of the pension fund trustees) and £1.1bn of cash and cash equivalent investments (including £720m cash in the
Post Office network funded partly by a Government loan facility), in accordance with investment restrictions set by the Government. It also
manages £1.2bn of financial liabilities and acts as internal banker for the Group’s business units. The Group finances its operations largely
through cash generated from its operations, borrowings and grants.

Group Treasury derives its authority from the Royal Mail Holdings plc Board, and provides quarterly monitoring reports for their review. It
only has the authority to undertake financial transactions relating to the management of the underlying business risks; it does not engage
in speculative transactions and does not operate as a profit centre. All strategies are risk averse, and the treasury policy has remained
substantially unchanged during the year. The principal financial instruments are Treasury bills, Government gilt edged securities, deposits
and long and short term borrowings.

At the balance sheet date the Group is financed from the following facilities provided by the Department for Business, Enterprise and
Regulatory Reform (BERR)

The terms of the Government borrowing facility and the associated Framework Agreement impose strict constraints on the separation of
cash funds within the Group and the purposes for which they can be used.

The principal treasury risks arising from the Group's activities are currency, counterparty, commodity (fuel) and liquidity risk. These are
managed as follows:

* the Group is exposed to foreign currency risk due to trading with overseas postal operators for carrying UK mail abroad and
delivering foreign origin mail in the UK, revaluation of the currency balances held to operate the Bureau de Change services within
Post Office Limited and various sales and purchase contracts denominated in foreign currency. Hedging programmes managed by
Group Treasury mitigate these risks. Where possible, exposures are netted internally and any remaining exposure is hedged using a
combination of external spot and forward contracts;

* the Group's obligation to pay overseas postal operators is denominated in Special Drawing Rights (SORs) - a basket currency
comprising of US Dollar (USS), Japanese Yen, Sterling and euro, The Group has a policy of matching receipts and payments for
individual currencies where possible and then hedging any material net exposure. The policy is that up to 80% of the forecast net
exposure is hedged with agreement of the internal business unit Group Treasury operates a rolling 18-month programme, which is
subsequently reviewed on a quarterly basis. There has been no external hedge in place throughout the last financial year;

© Bureau de Change balances are grouped into baskets of closely correlated currencies. Each currency basket (e.g. USS or euro) is
then sold forward, up to 100% of the exposure, creating a liability to match the underlying asset:

© significant foreign currency risk arising from capital purchase contracts, primarily in euro, may be hedged up to 100% depending
upon the reliability of the forecast of the underlying cash flows;

© the Group does not hedge the translation exposure created by the net assets of its overseas subsidiaries. However, it does hedge the
transactional exposure created by intercompany loans with these subsidiaries:

Business Environment.

Regulation

The EU Postal Services Directive 97/67/EC (‘PSD’) establishes the legal framework applying to postal services throughout the EU. It
requires the provision of a universal postal service across the EU within the framework of an internal EU postal market, with the gradual
and controlled liberalisation of that postal market

In 2000 the Postal Services Act came into force in the UK, creating an independent postal regulator ~ Postcomm which commenced a
process of market liberalisation and licensing regime of Royal Mail and competitors. Postcomm currently regulates the prices of over 80%
of the Royal Mail letters business, controls the terms and conditions for nearly all of its services, sets the quality of service targets and
determines compensation arrangements.

Post Office Limited is subject to regulation in financial services (Financial Services Authority) and in telephony (Ofcom). Post Office Limited
is an appointed representative of the Governor and Company of the Bank of Ireland, which in turn is regulated directly by both the Irish
Financial Regulator and Financial Services Authority (FSA) for conduct in the UK.

itis the Group's policy to be compliant with the regulatory framework in which we operate. During 2008-09, we have continued to
strengthen our compliance activities working in close liaison with our Regulators

Competition
The Group's business units operate in a competitive marketplace. Parcelforce Worldwide and GLS have been operating in an open market
since their inception. These units have demonstrated their ability to perform in a non-regulated and competitive environment, which is
reflected in their annual results.

Post Office Limited, due to a reduction in income from benefit payments and a significant and continuing decrease in Government use,
has developed revenue streams from financial services products (including car and home insurance, a ‘two-in-one’ credit card and range
of savings products) and its HomePhone and broadband services. These products are in direct competition with services offered by banks,
insurance and telephony companies, as are many of the services it continues to offer, e.g, bill payments, renewal of car tax discs and
travel services.

Royal Mail Holdings plc

Operating and Financial Review (continued)

Since February 2004, Royal Mail's operating environment has gradually been opened up to competition, with the letters market fully
liberalised in January 2006 - well in advance of the rest of Europe. Competitors are now able to offer customers the opportunity of end-
to-end service for the collection, sorting and delivery of their mail

Major Regulatory Activity in 2008-09

In December 2007, BERR announced an independent review of the UK postal services market to examine the impacts of liberalisation of
UK postal services, trends in the future market development and the likely impact of this on Royal Mail, alternative carriers and
consumers

The terms of reference for the review were:

. To assess the impacts to date of liberalisation of the UK postal services market, including on the Royal Mail, alternative carriers
and consumers;

. To explore trends in future market development and the likely impact of these on Royal Mail, alternative carriers and
consumers; and

. To consider how to maintain the Universal Service Obligation in the light of trends and market developments identified.

In March and May 2008, Royal Mail submitted its responses. The review panel published an initial response to evidence in May 2008 and
its final report to ministers in December 2008.

The key recommendations of the final report were:

. Regulation: the duty of regulating postal services will be transferred from Postcomm to Ofcom, with maintenance of the
universal postal service its primary duty in relation to postal services;

. Pensions: as part of a coherent package to secure the Royal Mail's tong term viability, Government will take full responsibility for
pensions liabilities in the Royal Mail Pension Plan incurred prior to December 2008;

. Partnership: Government will invite offers to enter into a partnership with Royal Mail, but with a firm commitment that Royal
Mail remains publicly owned; and

. Post Office Limited: the Royal Mail Group will be restructured so that Post Office Limited will remain entirely in Government
ownership.

In December 2008, Lord Mandelson confirmed to the House of Lords that the Government had accepted the findings of the independent
review and had received an expression of interest to purchase a minority stake in Royal Mail. In April 2008, Royal Mail confirmed that a
cash gap of £2.6bn existed between the cash flows Postcomm had predicted when setting the current four year price control and the
latest projections. In July 2008, Royal Mail announced that, for the first time ever, the universal service obligation had reported a loss in
excess of £100m.

In February 2009, the Government published legislation (the Postal Services Bill), in support of the independent review proposals and
aimed at ensuring the maintenance of a universal postal service and securing the future of a healthy publicly owned Royal Mail. The draft
bill is currently before Parliament.

As from October 2008, under the Consumer, Estate Agents and Redress Act 2007, Postwatch, the independent watchdog for postal
services, has been replaced by Consumer Focus. Consumer Focus was set up to represent the interests of consumers across the UK
economy at policy level. it was created through the merger of three consumer organisations - energywatch, Postwatch and the National
Consumer Council (including the Welsh and Scottish Consumer Councils). It has strong new legislative powers, including the right to
investigate any consumer complaint if it is of wider interest, the right to open up information from providers, the power to conduct
research and the ability to make an official super-complaint about failing services.

Corporate Social Responsibility

Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a key component in supporting the business to be recognised as a responsible organisation that
seeks to optimise the beneficial impacts inherent in our business and reduce the negative impacts. Through improving our CSR
performance and ensuring it is integrated into the way we work, we can make ourselves more productive and competitive. We are
working to reduce the number of accidents, reduce our production of CO2 and make our people healthier. We recognise that the route to
achieving and sustaining our goals is through our people and our relationship with customers, business partners, suppliers, communities
and other stakeholders.

A more comprehensive overview of our CSR will be found in the annual Corporate Social Responsibility report, to be published later in the
year.

Key Relationships
The Group has several key relationships that are critical to its day-to-day activities and its overall success.

People - Our people are the lifeblood of the organisation and brands. Without their continued support and dedication it will be impossible
to function on a day-to-day basis and embrace the change within our markets. Training, diversity, flexible resourcing and making the
business a great place to work are some of the ways we continue to improve this relationship.

Unions - The Communications Workers Union (CWU) represents non-managerial staff, with Unite the Union - Communication and
Managers’ Association (CMA) sector representing managerial staff. The Group's policy is to work with the CWU and CMA to engage staff in
the development and execution of business decisions.

Pension trustees - Our pension trustee board for the main pension plan comprises an independent chairman plus 10 people including
employees, union representatives, a pensioner and independent members. They take external professional advice, from Sacker & Partners
LLP (legal), Watson Wyatt Limited (actuary), KPMG LLP (auditors) and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (financial). They are responsible for
obtaining regular actuarial valuations of the plan to satisfy the statutory funding objective, which involves reaching agreement with Royal
Mail Group on the statement of funding principles, the recovery plan and the schedule of contributions. There is a separate trustee board
for the senior executives’ pension plan which comprises the chairman plus 5 individuals including employees, pensioners and an
independent member.

Customers - The Group's businesses and brands are used or recognised by almost everyone in the UK - from the largest of companies to
individuals. However, the 30 largest customers generate ¢.13% of Royal Mail's turnover and consequently the business is reliant on a
small customer base. As competition increases the Group will have to continue to simplify ways of doing business and design products
around customers’ needs. Customers are offered standard terms and conditions for the markets and countries in which the Group
operates.

Subpostmasters - The vast majority of Post Office Limited's ¢.12,000 Post Office branches are operated by subpostmasters, franchise
and multiple partners. The National Federation of Subpostmasters (NFSP) directly represents the interests of their members (typically
independent subpostmasters) and NFSP membership currently stands at c.8,000. As a consequence of representation, the NFSP
indirectly influences all other agents across the network through its negotiations conducted on behalf of the majority of independent
subpostmasters. As part of the annual cycle, Post Office Limited conducts remuneration negotiations with the NFSP whilst also working
closely with them on the many agent centric aspects of Post Office Limited's five year strategy - designed to deliver a viable physical
network by 2010-11.

There are also several major retailers who are also significant Post Office partners - operating around 1,500 Post Office branches across
the country, Post Office Limited liaises directly with these companies as well as deploying senior account managers and business
development managers to maintain successful working relationships at all levels, It is through the combination of effective partnership
with the NFSP, as well as with the National Multiple Partners, that Post Office Limited is able to take an overall view of the interests of the
majority of agents, as it wrestles with the challenges associated with the longer term viability of the network,

Suppliers - The Group has a wide range of suppliers, with its primary reliance on those relating to outsourcing of non-core services, such
as IT support. It works in partnership with its suppliers to ensure the right products and services are delivered at the right time at
competitive costs. A Group purchasing team monitors compliance to Group policy in awarding contracts or new business and adheres to
agreed credit terms.

The consumer body: Consumer Focus - In October 2008, Postwatch merged with energywatch and the Welsh, Scottish and National
Consumer Councils to form Consumer Focus. It is the new statutory organisation campaigning for a fair deal for consumers in England,
Wales, Scotland, and, for postal services, Northern Ireland. Consumer Focus wants to ensure postal consumers throughout the UK are
receiving a fair deal. It has strong new legislative powers including the right to investigate any consumer complaint if itis of wider interest,
the right to open up information from providers, the power to conduct research and the ability to make an official super-complaint about
failing services.

The Regulator: Postcomm - The independent regulator for the postal market, Postcomm, set up by the Postal Services Act 2000, is
responsible for setting a framework for Royal Mail's prices - the Price Control, in the form of a cap on the average price of a basket of
products. The price increases or reductions allowed by Postcomm through the Price Control have a very material impact on the likely
levels of cash flow the Company can generate. Postcomm also investigates compliance with Licence conditions and has broad powers to
reprimand publicly or fine Royal Mail if it finds it in breach of those conditions

Shareholder - The Company is a plc 100% owned by the Government. The Shareholder Executive (within BERR) manages the
shareholder relationship with the Company as a commercial shareholder. While management of the Group therefore lies with the
Company's Board of Directors, the Shareholder is kept up-to-date through quarterly performance reviews and is asked to approve the
Group's strategic plan. Any new funding required by the Group (apart from short term borrowings of less than one year) can only be
approved by Government if it meets commercial principles.

Principal Risks and Uncertainties

The Group uses a business-wide framework for the identification, assessment, treatment, monitoring and reporting of risk. The process
helps support business objectives by linking into business strategy, identifying and reacting to emerging risks, and developing cost effective
solutions to the management of risk

The following Group-level risks have been identified and are being managed to support the long-term sustainability of the Group. The
impact of some of these risks could be impairment to the value of the Group's brands - Royal Mail, GLS, Parcelforce Worldwide and Post
Office which are some of the most well known and trusted brands in the UK

The financial restructuring package agreed with the Government needs to be managed effectively
The business has agreed a financial restructuring package that will allow it to restructure the business, invest in new equipment and meet
instalments towards the pension fund deficit that has a major impact on Group profit and balance sheet. Effective management of this
package is crucial for the business to remain within the agreed financial restructuring parameters and to avoid potential sanctions or
penalties that could ensue,

Ineffective investment in the operational network could affect productivity levels and our ability to compete effectively
The business is embarking on a major investment programme to replace equipment and technology that is nearing the end of its life

cycle. The investment programme needs to be deployed effectively and future ongoing investment in the Group's operational network
maintained to ensure the Group's ability to compete effectively in the open market

The Group has a large pension fund deficit that requires funding

The size and volatility of the Royal Mail's pension fund deficit is a major challenge for the modernisation of the Company. As part of the
comprehensive package of reforms, Hooper recommended that action should be taken to reduce substantially the burden of Royal Mail's
historic pension liabilities. There remain uncertainties over the impact of fluctuations in the equity and debt markets affecting the value of
the funds’ assets and liabilities and the ability of the business to achieve the required levels of profitability and maintain our contributions
at the agreed level

Weakness in the UK economy or recession is likely to have a detrimental impact on the Group's profits

Historically there has been a correlation between the state of the UK economy and level of mails revenue. Economic weakness or
recession will have a direct impact on mail volumes and consequently on Group profit. In addition, there are certain critical suppliers to the
Group. If any of them were unable in the current economic climate to meet their service obligations, this would adversely impact the
Group's operations and results. Economic downturn may also impact the ability of key customers to continue trading, which would directly
impact Group revenue and profits.

The Government is the Company's only shareholder and the Group may be affected by any future change in Government policy
The influence of public policy considerations on Government may adversely affect the Group's ability to promote an effective business
strategy. This is particularly significant for Post Office Limited which is required to run its branch network as a commercial business and is
reliant on Government support for loss making branches

FUJ00116857
FUJ00116857

Royal Mail Holdings plc

Operating and Financial Review (continued)

Group revenues and profit are subject to several uncertainties

The postal market has evolved rapidly as a result of liberalisation. Competitors are aggressively targeting business customers. Additionally
business customers are downtrading using less profitable products. In addition overall mail market volumes are declining. Technological
innovation is increasing, customers can now switch to alternative offerings and information can be sent or made available faster and, in
many cases, at a lower cost than traditional mail services. If technological substitution continues, market volumes will decrease further. At
the same time, increased awareness of and sensitivity to “green” issues, including the use of paper, may impact customer sentiment and
drive down usage of mail or increase switching to alternatives.

Furthermore Royal Mail's regulatory regime impacts the business's profitability in two key areas.

© The Universal Service Obligation (USO) requires Royal Mail to maintain a national collection and delivery network, resulting in Royal
Mail incurring a higher fixed cost base than our competitors. Unless the applicable regulatory restraints permit Royal Mail to recover
from this imbalance, there is a risk that Royal Mail will always lose money on stamped mail, whilst competitors procure more
profitable products such as business mail; and

© Royal Mail's prices for most of its letters products are determined by Price Control reviews and negotiation with the regulator, which
can reduce our flexibility and profitability, leading to uncertainty over how the future Licence and regulatory regime will affect Royal
Mail

The Group is subject to regulatory restrictions on our operations and the risk of penalties for non-compliance
Royal Mail's postal operator's Licence contains material restrictions on the operation of the business. These include:

© Obligations over the delivery and collection of mail:

Restrictions over the freedom to set prices: and

* Obligations to give competitors access to our network.
If Royal Mail breaches certain postal operator's Licence conditions or other regulatory requirements it may be subject to financial
penalties. There is increased uncertainty as to how the regulatory regime will affect Royal Mail in the future as the proposed transition
from Postcomm to Ofcom may lead to differences in regulatory approach
In addition to our postal operator's Licence the Group is also subject to oversight by other regulators. This affects Post Office Limited
which has to satisfy the FSA's requirements as an appointed representative of The Governor and Company of the Bank of Ireland who are
regulated by the FSA in respect of investment, mortgage and insurance intermediation activity in the UK. It is also subject to anti-money
laundering regulations issued under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 and enforced by HM Revenue and Customs. Post Office Limited is
also licensed as a telephone service provider by Ofcom, which requires service providers to issue and adhere to Codes of Practice.

Without a continued change of culture within the organisation future development may be affected
The changing and uncertain postal market place, the impact of competition and regulation and increased customer expectations place
major challenges on all employees to adapt and improve productivity to levels that will allow the business to compete effectively. These
challenges need to be met by ongoing cultural change within the organisation.

Without a flexible, efficient and co-operative culture, Royal Mail could become loss making as mail volumes decline. Significant industrial
action could have a major detrimental effect on the Group's reputation and profits.

The Group's business activities are time critical and, if key infrastructure facilities were disrupted, it could have an impact on
results

The business is subject to a number of operational risks to its nationwide delivery and retail outlet networks, including natural disasters,
fire, flood, explosion, possibility of work stoppages or civil unrest, transport infrastructure disruption, power failures, unavailability of key
supplies, breakdown or failure of equipment, health pandemics, terrorism and the normal hazards associated with running a complex
infrastructure. A major disruption could have an adverse impact on customer services as well as business and operating results.

The Group may be affected by future environmental and related fiscal measures
The Group operates a large vehicle fleet and a substantial property portfolio that consume large amounts of energy. Although the Group
is disposing of surplus property and is deploying a Carbon Management Programme, it may be affected by future environmental
measures and adverse fiscal impact from increased energy costs and “green” taxation.

The Group operates a substantial treasury operation and is exposed to foreign currency risk and fuel price risk
Foreign currency risk is due to trading with overseas postal operators for carrying UK mail abroad and delivering foreign origin mail in the
UK, revaluation of currency balances held to operate the Bureau de Change services and various sales and purchase contracts
denominated in foreign currency. The fuel price risk arises from operating a large vehicle fleet and, on jet fuel risk, from purchasing air
freight services. If the treasury strategy does not fully cover the Group's exposures, this could result in funds not being readily available
when required or a negative impact on profit due to increased costs.

The Group is exposed to credit risk
As a result of the economic recession the exposure of the business to credit risks with major trading partners has increased. Management
have taken all the steps they believe to be practical and appropriate in the circumstances to guard against these risks and continue to
monitor the situation carefully.

The Group is subject to changes in both domestic and European regulation and legislation, which could expose it to possible
additional costs
Various changes to European or domestic law will have a direct impact on the Group; such as the European Working Time Directive,
international financial reporting standards, speed restrictions on the Group's vehicles and increased liberalisation of the market for postal
service providers.

Summary

The Group has produced a strong financial performance with an operating profit before exceptional items generated by all the businesses
for the first time in nearly twenty years. This was against a backdrop of difficult trading conditions with a slowdown experienced in the
global economy.

Royal Mail reversed its prior year loss position to deliver an operating profit despite falling revenues. Delivery of operating efficiencies as
we progress with our transformation programme have offset the impact of accelerating volume decline, losses to competition and
customers switching to lower priced products. Post Office Limited generated an operating profit compared to a loss in the previous year,
attributable to cost saving benefits from deploying our strategy. Despite the tough economic environment, both parcels businesses - GLS
and Parcelforce Worldwide - delivered revenue growth in highly competitive environments

There was a net cash outflow for the Group this year, driven by payments into the pension funds and investment in modernisation of our
operations.

Although we have made significant progress to date, challenges remain concerning the pension deficit, volume decline, financing of the
USO and the continued delivery of our transformation plans. Access to funding to enable Royal Mail to accelerate modernisation is critical
to the success of the Group. The implementation of the Hooper proposals will clearly have a major impact on the Group's future
prospects.

Policy on the payment of suppliers

The policy of the Company and its principal operating subsidiaries is to use their purchasing power fairly. Payment terms are agreed in
advance for all major contracts. For lower value transactions, the standard payment terms of the supplier apply. It is the Company's policy
to abide with the agreed terms. The Company and its principal operating subsidiaries in the UK have sought to comply with the
Department for Business Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (BERR) Better Payment Practice Code. Copies of this can be obtained from

Directors and their interests
The Directors of the Company and details of changes during the year are given on pages 26 and 27. The Secretary of State appoints the

Director has taken all reasonable steps to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the auditors are
aware of that information.

Qualifying third party indemnity provisions for Directors
A partial qualifying third party indemnity provision (as defined in section 234 of the Companies Act 2006) was and remains in force for
the benefit of all the Directors of the Company and former Directors who held office during the year. The indemnity is granted under
article 129 of the Company's Articles of Association. The indemnity is partial in that it does not allow the Company to cover the costs of an
unsuccessful defence of a third party claim

People
The Group employs over 176,000 people (2008 over 181,000) in our UK wholly owned subsidiaries. An analysis of the Group headcount
is shown in note 4 to the accounts. Our people are our ambassadors, our brand and our service

The Group's policy is to encourage effective communication and consultation between our people, particularly on matters relating to
strategy, financial and economic factors that may influence their Business Unit's performance. This is achieved through the use of an
extensive range of communication channels, including our employee opinion survey, magazines, briefings, open forums, TV screens and
an intranet website. Our people have various bonus schemes, significant elements of which are based on business-related targets.

We actively encourage continuous training and skill development for all our people to ensure achievement of corporate and individual
objectives. Management development and training programmes have been designed to attract and retain the best. The Group has worked

Directors’ Report (continued)

An Equal Opportunities policy is maintained in all respects including disability, age, religion, colour, sex, nationality, ethnic origin, sexual
orientation, race, creed, marital status and equality

In 2003, we embarked on a business wide engagement programme to make Royal Mail Group a ‘Great Place to Work. The purpose of the
programme is to encourage colleagues to contribute to improving their working environment; to equip them with the skills they need; to
develop pride in and understanding of the business; and to drive respect for colleagues. In short, to ensure people considerations are at
the heart of all major business decisions. The programme is ongoing and remains an integral part of our people strategy.

This strategy will ensure we realise our full potential through the strength of our people by developing a high-performing, sustainable
culture where everyone feels involved and valued. It focuses on seven key areas:

© creating interesting, meaningful jobs with more flexible working patterns:

© identifying and developing for all our people a set of core behaviours that determine how we treat each other, our customers and
our Shareholder;

. building a fluid, innovative and agile organisation to improve our response to environmental and market changes;

. developing a high-performance culture in which everyone understands their contribution and is motivated to achieve their full
potential;

. defining, recruiting and developing the core capabilities we need to thrive in a competitive, deregulated market;

. recruiting, attracting and developing the leadership and management capability we need to deliver our goals; and

. enhancing our ability to attract and retain the talent required to compete successfully.

Our intention is to underpin our people strategy with a measurement system that will objectively demonstrate the value of our people and
their contribution to the success of our business.

Currently, the way we monitor our progress towards becoming a ‘Great Place to Work’ is by using Have Your Say. our colleague opinion
survey, launched in January 2003. This is carried out on a rolling basis, reaching 1/12" of our people every month, and the results are
reviewed monthly right through the business - from local level up to Board level.

Corporate Sociat Responsibility
The Group is committed to carrying out its activities in a socially responsible manner in respect of the environment, employees, customers
and local communities. A Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Committee reports to the Board, which publishes an annual report of its
activities. Further details of our CSR governance structure and activities will be available in our 2009 CSR Report, due to be published
later in the year.

Disabled employees
The Group's policy is to give full consideration to applications for employment from disabled persons. Employees who become disabled
whilst employed receive full support through the provision of training and special equipment to facilitate continued employment where
practicable. The Group provides training, career development and promotion to disabled employees wherever appropriate.

Going concern
After analysis of the financial resources available and cash flow projections for the Group, the Directors consider that it is appropriate to
prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis. Further details are provided under funding in note 2 to the accounts.

Auditor
A resolution to reappoint Ernst & Young LLP as auditor will be put to the Annual General Meeting

Corporate Governance

Statement by the Directors on compliance with the Combined Code
The Board is committed to high standards of Corporate Governance and supports the Combined Code on Corporate Governance (the
Code), published in July 2003 and revised in June 2006. The Company has fully complied with the Code during the year. The following
statement is intended to explain our governance policies and practices in light of the Code principles and provisions in so far as they are
appropriate to a public company with a single Shareholder, and to provide insight into how the Board and management run the business
for the benefit of the Shareholder.

The Board
The Board is responsible for setting the objectives and strategy of the Group and for monitoring performance. At the end of the year, the
Board comprised a Chairman, four Executive Directors and five Non Executive Directors. At that date there were one executive and one
non-executive Director vacancies. The biographies of each of the Directors, setting out their current roles, commitments and previous
experience, are on pages 26 and 27. The Board usually meets monthly, and has defined those matters that are reserved exclusively for its
consideration. These include the approval of strategic plans, financial statements, acquisitions and disposals, major contracts, projects, and
capital expenditure. It delegates responsibilities to the Board Committees detailed below. For each scheduled meeting of the Board, the
Company Secretary, on behalf of the Chairman, collates and circulates the papers, aiming to allow sufficient time for the Directors to
review the information provided. The Board is confident that all its members have the knowledge, talent and experience to perform the
functions required of a Director of the business. Executive Directors have rolling 12-month contracts and Non Executive Directors are
generally appointed for three-year terms.

The Board considers that each of the Non Executive Directors is independent. This means that in the view of the Board, they have no links
to the Executive Directors and other managers, and no business or other relationship with the Company that could interfere with their
judgement. Richard Handover is the Senior Independent Director. There is also a clear division of responsibilities between the Chairman
and the Chief Executive, Performance evaluation of the Board, its Committees and individual Directors takes place on an annual basis
This is led by the Senior Independent Director with the support of the Company Secretary, The evaluation is conducted by way of a formal
questionnaire that enables Directors’ perspectives on the effectiveness of the Board and its Committees to be fed back to the full Board
Performance evaluations of Board Committees are conducted by the Chairmen of the respective Board Committees. The Non Executive
Directors, led by the Senior Independent Director, review the performance of the Chairman and the Executive Directors. The Executive
Directors, led by the Group Chief Executive, review the performance of the Non Executive Directors.

Directors may take independent professional advice in the furtherance of their duties, at the Group's expense. All Directors have access to
the advice and services of the Company Secretary, the appointment and removal of whom is a matter for the Board as a whole.

All Directors appointed by the Board are required by the Company's Articles of Association to be elected by the Shareholder at the first
AGM after their appointment. On appointment, the Directors take part in an induction programme in which they receive information about
the Group, the role of the Board and matters reserved for its decision, the role of the principal Board Committees, the Group's Corporate
Governance arrangements and the latest financial information about the Group. This is supplemented by visits to key business locations.
The Group engages in two-way communication with the Shareholder to discuss information on its strategy, performance and policies. The
Board receives feedback on these meetings from the Directors attending them

Outside appointments

Executive Directorships of companies outside of the Group. The Board's policy is normally to limit Executive Directors to one Non
Executive Directorship, for which the Director may retain the fees (see the Directors’ Remuneration Report on page 41 for details).

Board Committees
The following Committees deal with specific aspects of the Group's governance. The full terms of reference for each of the principal
Committees are available on the Company's website (www.royalmailgroup.com) or on written request from the Company Secretary. The

Internal control

Overview
The Directors are responsible for the Group's system of risk management and internal control as well as the timely review of its
effectiveness. The system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only
provide reasonable but not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.

The Group’s approach to internal control is based on the underlying principle of line management accountability for control and risk
management. There is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the Group in accordance
with the guidance detailed by the Turnbull Committee as part of the Combined Code, including financial, operational, compliance risks and
risks to reputation. The Board regularly reviews this process. The process has been in place throughout the year and up to the date of
approval of these accounts. The responsibility for joint ventures and associates rests, on the whole, with the senior management of those
operations. The Company monitors its investments and exerts influence through Board representations.

The Board has reviewed the effectiveness of the system of risk management and internal control. The key elements include a review of
Internal Audit reports, regular confirmations from local management and communications from the Chair of the Audit & Risk Committee
‘on the outcome of Audit & Risk Committee meetings.

Audit and Risk Committee
The Committee reports to the Board and meets as a minimum on a quarterly basis to monitor and review the effectiveness of the risk
management processes and the control environment. The Committee reviews the scope of work, authority and resources of the Internal
Audit and Risk Management function. The Audit & Risk Committee regularly reviews the Group risk profile

Corporate Risk Management Committee

The Committee acts as a sub-committee to the Audit & Risk Committee and meets quarterly to support the Group Executive Team in
ensuring pro-active management of risks within the business. The committee promotes the establishment, communication and
embedding of risk management throughout the business, as well as regularly reviewing emerging risks.

Key control processes
The key control processes are ongoing and include the following

+ the Group’s Code of Business Standards sets the principles of professionalisrn and integrity for our people:
=the business units have authority to manage within the limits set by the Board and within the scope of reserved powers.
. the Board discuss and approve the strategic direction plans and objectives of the Group and each operating company, and the

risks to achieving them;
= the Board and Group Executive Team review and approve budgets and forecasts,

= the Group Executive Team and executive business unit management review performance monthly by reference to key
performance indicators, updated forecasts and information on the key risk areas;

= the Audit & Risk Committee review quarterly the scope and results of internal audit work across the Group. The scope of the work
covers all key activities of the Group and concentrates on higher risk areas;

= the Audit & Risk Committee review the scope of the work of the external auditor and any significant issues arising; and
. the Audit & Risk Committee review key accounting policies and delegated authority levels.

Risk Management process
The process consists of formal identification by management at each level of the Group of the key risks to achieving their business
objectives and the controls in place to manage them. The likelihood and potential impact of each risk is evaluated. Risk management
action plans are monitored at executive level to ensure key risks are being mitigated. The process also includes:

bi-annual certification by management that they are responsible for managing the risks to their business objectives and that the
internal controls are such that they provide reasonable but not absolute assurance that the risks are appropriately identified,
evaluated and managed; and

. independent assurance by Internal Audit as to the existence and effectiveness of the risk management activities described by
management.

The system of risk management and internal control is embedded into the operations of the Group, and the actions taken to mitigate any
weaknesses are monitored.

Directors’ Remuneration Report (continued)

The figures in the table represent emoluments earned and receivable as Directors during the financial year, whenever paid. Such
emoluments are normally paid in the same financial year with the exception of the annual, performance-related bonus, which is paid in the
year following that in which it is earned and the amount deferred into LTIP that is not paid until the LTIP matures.

These payments are consistent with the policy of the Remuneration Committee. The following sections describe the Committee, its
general policy and the main elements of remuneration

Remuneration Policy

The Remuneration Committee

The Board retains overall accountability for the framework and costs of executive remuneration and the terms of the service contracts
offered to all Executive Directors. These also require the consent of the Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory
Reform. The Secretary of State also gives consent for the remuneration arrangements for Non Executive Directors. The Remuneration
Committee's role is to develop the remuneration policy for Executive Directors and their immediate reports and specifically to make
recommendations on their salary, benefits, bonuses and other terms and conditions of employment. The Committee also recommends
appropriate compensation on the ending of employment, giving careful consideration to the circumstances of the particular case and the
ability of the individual to mitigate.

The Remuneration Committee is made up wholly of independent Non Executive Directors. Membership of the Committee is given on page
33. The Chief Executive, Adam Crozier, and the Group HR Director, may attend these meetings by invitation and are not present at the
discussion of their own remuneration

Advice to the Remuneration Committee
The Committee calls for information and advice from inside and outside the Group. It takes advice from those independent, professional
organisations that are best able to assist it on the particular topic under discussion.

During 2008-09, advice on the performance of key executives was given by the Chairman and the Chief Executive. Information on the
external marketplace was given by Monks Partnership (a trading name of PricewaterhouseCoopers), Deloitte LLP, Hay Management
Consultants and Watson Wyatt Limited. Internal support is primarily provided by the Acting Group HR Director, Jon Millidge, and from the
Company Secretary, Jonathan Evans. Other advice and information has been provided by specialists from the HR and Finance
Departments

During the year, advice was given to the Company by Watson Wyatt Limited on pensions and actuarial matters.

Remuneration poticy
The Company's policy on Directors’ remuneration is that:

* the overall remuneration package should be sufficiently competitive to attract and retain executives of the necessary quality in a
complex business and a competitive market place, who will deliver success for the Shareholder and high levels of customer service
safety and environmental performance:

© asignificant proportion of the remuneration package should be dependent on performance - both short and long-term; and
© the system of remuneration should bring together the interests of senior executives, customers and the Shareholder.
The policy for senior executives takes into account pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group.

The Committee regularly reviews the package and its competitiveness against appropriate marketplaces. The Committee aims to ensure
that the package is proportionate and effective, and that it follows accepted best practice

The main components of remuneration
The main components for Executive Directors are: basic salary, an annual performance-related bonus, a Long-Term incentive Plan (LTIP),
pension and other benefits. The Committee believes that there should be a particular emphasis on performance-related elements

Royal Mail Holdings plc

Directors’ Remuneration Report (continued)
Base salaries

The Committee believes that base salaries should be set at levels that are sufficient to recruit and retain high calibre executives. In making
its judgement, the Committee considers information from several sources so that a fair comparison can be made with enterprises of a
similar size and complexity to Royal Mail. This data is provided by independent consultancies, usually based on the published annual
reports of other organisations. Increases are recommended where the Committee believes that it is necessary to reflect contribution,
increased individual responsibilities and market levels. The Secretary of State's consent is required for all material changes to Directors’
remuneration.

The Chief Executive asked the Remuneration Committee to waive his salary increase for 2008-09 and 2009-10 making three consecutive
years in which his pay will remain the same. Mark Higson received an increase of 2% with effect from 1 July 2008. lan Duncan and Alan
Cook were awarded increases to £350,000 and £300,000 respectively to reflect their performance and accountabilities. These increases
were due to be phased so that with effect from 1 July 2008 their base salaries moved to £325,000 and £282,000 respectively, with the
remainder of their increase due from 1 July 2009. Alan Cook and lan Duncan have asked, however, that the Remuneration Committee
exercise its discretion to postpone their increases from July 2009. Consequently no Executive Director will receive a pay increase in 2009-

For 2008-09, the annual bonus plan followed the model of the previous year, which included the following weightings:

© all Business roles had a weighting of 30% on Group performance and 70% Business performance. This applied to the Managing
Directors of Letters and Post Office Limited; and

+ all Group roles had a weighting of 90% on Group performance and a further 10% weighting given to Post Office Limited's
performance in view of the importance of supporting the recovery of that business.

The following tables show the make up of the annual bonus plan as percentages of annual salary.

Long-Term Incentive Plans

A three-year LTIP is in place for the period 2007-08 to 2009-10.
Performance is measured by Return on Total operating Assets (ROTA).
The principles of the plan are as follows:

(2) Company Performance Awards can be made each year which accrue on a sliding scale above a threshold level of performance,
beginning at 12.5% of annual base salary. For on-target performance, the Company Award is 25% of annual base salary and for
exceptional performance this rises to a maximum of 37.5%.

Directors’ Remuneration Report (continued)

(b) Bonus Awards. A Bonus Award can be made each year by the Remuneration Committee. These are only made if the Director waives
a proportion of their annual bonus. LTIP Bonus Awards do not exceed the amount of annual bonus waived. A Director has the
discretion to waive a maximum of one half of any annual bonus up to the on-target level. if a bonus above on-target would
otherwise be payable, then three quarters of this additional amount above the on-target level will be compulsorily waived.

(QA Multiplying Factor. Company and Bonus Awards may be increased by a factor that measures ROTA across the plan. If the on-
target level is achieved for the relevant period then each of the Company Awards and Bonus Awards to which it applies are
increased by an additional one third. In the case of exceptional performance, then up to a maximum addition of 100% is added.

Payments under the plan will be made in June 2010.
The Company and Bonus Awards for 2007-08 are effectively shared equally between this plan and the previous arrangement
The performance targets for the 2009-10 year of the plan are still under discussion with the Government.

Company Awards

These are measured against an annual ROTA target. ROTA incentivises the productive value of the business and emphasises the need to
make efficient use of all operational assets. It covers the need to make a proper return both on any new investments that are made and
on the existing asset base

For 2007-08 the following table against annual ROTA applied

Royal Mail ROTA achievement Percentage of Base Salary
On target 2.1% 25%
Maximum, 5.1% 37.5%

The outturn achievement was 3.9%, resulting in a Company Award of 32.5%

For 2008-09 the following applied

Royal Mail ROTA achievement Percentage of Base Salary
On target 8.2% 25%
Maxirnum 12.0% 37.5%

The outturn achievement was 10.1% resulting in a Company Award of 30.6%.

Bonus Awards

As described above, a Director may waive a maximum of one half of any annual bonus up to the on-target level and must waive three
quarters of any bonus earned above the on-target level. If a proportion of annual bonus is waived then a Bonus Award may be made
within the LTIP, not exceeding that value.

Multiplying Factor
The Multiplying Factor is dependent upon cumulative ROTA over 2007-08 to 2009-10.

Benefits
Benefits include the provision of a company car, health insurance, relocation costs, or the cash equivalent of any benefits not taken

Pensions
The Group has a liability to pay pensions in respect of Directors’ services and, for some Executive Directors, makes contributions to
pension schemes for this purpose. The Company pays a cash supplement to Directors whose contributions to the Company scheme are
restricted by the scheme-specific earnings cap. The Company continues to apply the schemne-specific earnings cap, indexed by inflation
each year, as a constraint on the amount of salary that is pensionable through the Company scheme

Following a review of its pension arrangements, the Company has introduced changes to its pension provision for all employees including
Executive Directors with effect from 1 April 2008. From 1 April 2008 the defined benefit pension plans have been closed to new members
and pension for future service accrues on a career salary basis. Furthermore from 1 April 2010 the normal retirement age under the
plans will increase to age 65 and the earliest age for receipt of a reduced pension will be 55.

Fixed and performance-retated elements of Executive Directors’ remuneration (excluding pensions)

For 2008-09, 33% of Directors’ potential annual earnings related to fixed elements whilst 67% related to annualised performance
elements, for the Group Chief Executive 30% was fixed and 70% was variable. The element of remuneration at risk to performance is that
available through the Long-Term Incentive Plan and the performance-related annual bonus

Service contracts
The Committee's policy is that Executive Directors appointed to the Board are offered notice periods of one year. The Committee has a

Notes to the Group accounts
1. Authorisation of financial statements and statement of compliance with IFRSs

The Group's financial statements for the 52 weeks ended 29 March 2009 were authorised for issue by the Board on 13 May 2009 and the
balance sheet was signed on the Board's behalf by Adam Crozier and lan Duncan.

The Group's financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the
European Union and as they apply to the financial statements of the Group for the 52 weeks ended 29 March 2009. The principal accounting
policies adopted by the Group are set out in note 2.

2. Accounting policies

Basis of preparation and accounting

The Group comprises Royal Mail Holdings ple (the Company) - which is wholly owned by HM Government - and its subsidiaries. The Company
is incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Cornpanies Act 1985 (the Act) and the accounts are produced in accordance with the Act and
applicable IFRSs.

The Group financial statements are presented in sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest £m except where otherwise indicated

Royal Mail Group Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, may be exposed to the risk of being fined by its industry Regulator and of
being required to pay compensation to certain customers, as a result of failing to meet operational targets set by the Regulator in its licence. In
this situation the amount of such fines and compensation will be determined by the Regulator after further representations from Royal Mail
Group Ltd and no further information will be disclosed on the grounds that it can be expected to prejudice the outcome of that process.

Changes in accounting policy
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year except as follows.

The Group has adopted the following new IFRIC interpretation during the year.

IFRIC 14 - IAS 19 - The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their interaction

IFRIC 14 provides guidance on how to assess the limit on the amount of surplus in a defined benefit scheme that can be recognised as an
asset under IAS 19 on Employee Benefits. The adoption of this revised interpretation did not have any effect on the financial performance or
position of the Group in the current or prior periods as the Group's defined benefit schemes are in deficit and the Group has an absolute right
to any assets left over after benefits have been secured

Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
The preparation of the Group's consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, at the reporting date. However, uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could
result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the asset or liability affected in future periods.

The key sources of uncertainty that have a significant risk of causing material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities
within the next financial year relate to the measurement of the defined benefit pension obligations, deferred tax and ColleagueShare plan costs.

Defined benefit pension obligations
Measurement of the defined benefit obligations requires certain assumptions to be made including on life expectancy, future changes in
salaries, inflation and a suitable discount rate. The size of these obligations, and therefore the pension deficit, is materially sensitive to the
assumptions adopted. The assumptions which have the most significant impact on the measurement of the defined benefit obligations are the
real discount rate and the mortality rates. A 0.1 percentage point change to the discount rate could change the liabilities by approximately
£420m. An additional one year on the life expectancy could increase liabilities by approximately £620m. The major assumptions and carrying
value of the obligations are disclosed in note 26.

Deferred tax

Assessment of the deferred tax asset requires an estimation of future profitability. Such estimation is inherently uncertain in a market subject
to various competitive pressures. Should estimates of future profitability change in future years, the amount of deferred tax recognised will
also change accordingly. The carrying values of the deferred tax assets and liabilities are included within note 9

ColleagueShare plan
The calculation of the ColleagueShare costs and liabilities is reliant on a number of judgements, estimates and assumptions. These include in
particular forecasts for the potential equity value of ColleagueShares, forecasts of joiners and leavers throughout the life of the plan and
judgements on when participants are likely to exercise their rights for the Company to redeem the ColleagueShares that they hold. The
magnitude of the costs involved is sensitive to these forecasts and assumptions. The carrying values of the ColleagueShare liabilities are
included within notes 24 and 22

Funding

Royal Mail Group Ltd

Royal Mail Group Ltd is facing considerable cash requirements with respect to its investment in plant and equipment and funding its
worsening pension deficit at a time when the market has been opened up to full competition

On 23 March 2007, a funding package totalling £1.2bn up until 2016 was completed with Government and for which State Aid approval
was received in April 2009. The £900m senior debt facility expires in March 2014. It has been assumed that another facility will be
negotiated to be available at this time.

In making an assessment on Royal Mail Group L's ability to continue as a going concern, the Directors have assumed the successful
execution of the transformation plan which is reflected in the detailed 5 year business plan approved by the Board. There are a number of
uncertainties in relation to the funding and headroom requirements which are set out below.

In December 2008 an independent review of the UK postal services sector was published. Further to the recommendations in the review,
Royal Mail is in discussion with its Shareholder about how it may transfer the historic pension liabilities to the Government. The
Government has indicated that this transfer will only take place if a minority stake in Royal Mail is sold to a third party

If the transfer of historic pension liabilities to Government does not happen, the Directors will have to review the cash requirements of the
strategic plan and discuss and agree an affordable payment profile with the Royal Mail Pension Plan Trustees. Due to the worsening
pension deficit position the payment of the deficit is likely to need to extend beyond the 14 years remaining of the 17 year repayment profile
agreed in 2006 and itis assumed that the pension escrow established in 2007 will continue to be required,

Current projections suggest that the Loan to Value (LTV) covenant may be breached in 2010-11 following the recent decline in property
values and assuming that this value decline does not reverse. If the property values do not recover the Directors have informed
Government that they would seek to negotiate a waiver to the covenant. Any waiver or changes will be on a commercial basis.

if the waiver discussed above was not available or other risks in relation to the business plan materialise, the Directors have identified a
portfolio of operational and strategic actions that could be taken to reduce the loan requirements and enable the covenant to be met or
provide additional funding to mitigate any headroom exposures.

On the basis of careful consideration of the cash flow projections and the above considerations the Directors have concluded that it is
appropriate that the accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis.

Post Office Limited
Post Office Limited had net liabilities as at 29 March 2009 and, excluding government funding, had a cash outflow in the year but has
operated at a profit before exceptional items during 2008-09 for the first time for a number of years.

To become viable in the longer-term, new business areas continue to be developed and grown in order to replace the lost contribution from
traditional income sources and significant cost reduction programmes continue to be implemented.

During the year, Post Office Limited has updated its strategic plan and will continue with the implementation of a number of radical
programmes which are designed to improve the profitability of the company. The branch closure programme is completed and no further
dosures are planned but further work on efficiency improvements and improving the business model continues. These programmes include:

© the development of new business and drive for sales growth:
bringing the crown branch segment into profit; and

a programme of fundamental cost reduction.

The current plan 2006-2011 is supported by a funding agreement with Government announced on 17 May 2007, which provided for:

© £465m funding to compensate Post Office Limited for the other net costs of providing certain specified “services of general economic
interest’. £313m was received on 31 July 2007, £77m on 1 April 2008 and £75m on 15 Aprit 2008;

© funding of £150m per year to compensate for losses sustained in parts of the network; and
© the extension, on 18 April 2008, of the existing working capital facility of £1.15bn to 2011.
State Aid approval has been received for the above funding which runs to 2011.

Whilst the Directors are satisfied with the progress that has been made it should be noted that the completion of the regeneration
programmes will take several years to achieve. Accordingly there will be a need to gain agreement with respect to the continuation of the
£150m network subsidy payment for the period beyond March 2011, as well as the replacement or extension of the working capital
facilities. These arrangements will need State Aid approval.

Notwithstanding these uncertainties, the Directors recognise that significant progress has been made in delivering its Plan for which funding
is in place and, after careful consideration, continue to believe that Post Office Limited will be able to meet its liabilities as they fall due in the
foreseeable future. Accordingly, on that basis, the Directors consider that it is appropriate that these financial statements are prepared on a
going concern basis.

After analysis of the financial resources available and cash flow projections for the Group, including consideration of the financing
arrangements outlined above, the Directors consider that it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis.

2. Accounting policies (continued)

Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements comprise the accounts of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings. The financial statements of the
major subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the Company. using consistent accounting policies

All intragroup balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from intragroup transactions, have been eliminated in full
Transfer prices between business segments are set on a basis of charges reached through a negotiation with the respective businesses

Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is obtained by the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which
control is no longer held by the Group. Where the Group ceases to hold control of a subsidiary, the consolidated financial statements include
the results for the part of the reporting year during which the Group held control

Minority interests represent the portion of profit/loss, gains/losses and net assets relating to subsidiaries that are not attributable to members
of the Company. The minority interests balance is presented separately within equity in the consolidated balance sheet, separately from parent
shareholders’ equity.

Investments in joint ventures and associates

The Group's investments in its joint ventures and associates are accounted for under the equity method of accounting, Under the equity
method, the investment is carried in the balance sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Group's share of the net assets of the joint
ventures/associates, less any impairment in value. The income statement reflects the Group's share of post tax profits from the joint ventures/
associates.

Any goodwill arising on acquisition of an associate, representing the excess of the cost of the investment compared to the Group's share of the
net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired, is included in the carrying amount and not amortised. To
the extent that the net fair value of the associate's identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is greater than the cost of the
investment, a gain is recognised and added to the Group's share of the associate's profit or loss in the period in which the investment is
acquired.

Revenue
Revenue reported in the income statement comprises of Turnover and the Social Network Payment. Turnover principally relates to the
rendering of services as follows:

Royal Mail
Account revenue is derived from specific contracts and recognised when the mail delivery is complete. Prepaid revenue mainly relating to
stamp and meter income is recognised when the sale is made, adjusted to reflect a value of stamp and meter credits held but not used by the
customer.

Parcelforce Worldwide
Account revenue is derived from specific contracts and recognised when the delivery of an item is complete

Post Office Limited
Revenue is recognised when retail and financial services are provided,

General Logistics Systems
Revenue is derived from specific contracts and is recognised at the time of delivery.

The Social Network Paymentis Government grant revenue recognised to match the related costs of providing the network of public post offices
that the Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform considers appropriate and which would otherwise not be provided.

Distribution and conveyance
Distribution and conveyance costs relate to third party costs incurred in carrying mail. These include conveyance by rail, road, sea and air,
together with costs incurred by international mail carriers and Parcelforce Worldwide delivery operators. These costs are disclosed separately
on the face of the income statement.

Operating profit before exceptional items

Operating profit is the profit arising from the normal, recurring operations of the business. This incorporates revenue, people costs, distribution
and conveyance costs, other operating costs and the Group’s post tax share of profits from joint ventures and associates. Operating exceptional
items are separately identified.

Operating exceptional items
Operating exceptional items are material items of income and expenditure arising from the operations of the business which, due to the nature
of the events giving rise to them, require separate presentation on the face of the income statement to allow a better understanding of
financial performance in the year, in comparison to prior years

ColleagueShare plan
ColleagueShare is the name for the Group's phantom share plan. The plan, introduced in 2007-08, is a five-year plan spanning the accounting
years from April 2007 to March 2012 and comprises both a phantom share scheme and a related stakeholder dividend worth up to £5,300
per person throughout the life of the plan. The ColleagueShares represent up to a total of 20% of the projected equity value of the Group.
Additionally Royal Mail plans to pay a stakeholder dividend dependent on the achievement of certain targets

The costs of the plan are being charged to the income statement as an exceptional item throughout the life of the plan and are included within
payables or provisions as appropriate. Any long-term liabilities arising in relation to the plan will be discounted at an appropriate high quality
corporate bond rate. These discounts will be unwound through the income statement during the life of the plan. The Group will redeem all
ColleagueShares by 2012.

Operating profit
Operating profit is the profit arising from the normal, recurring operations of the business and after charging operating exceptional items
defined above. It excludes the non operating exceptional items for profit or loss on disposal of businesses and profit or loss on disposal of
property, plant and equipment. These items are not part of the normal recurring operations of the business but are material, so are presented
separately on the face of the income statement to allow a better understanding of financial performance in the year, in comparison to prior
years.

Goodwill

Business combinations on or after 29 March 2004 are accounted for under IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ using the purchase method. Any
excess of the cost of the business combination over the Group's interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent
liabilities at the date of acquisition is recognised in the balance sheet as goodwill and is not amortised.

After initial recognition, goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill arising from business combinations is
reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.

An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset (or cash generating unit)
exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of an asset's net realisable value and its value in use. For the purpose of such impairment
eviews, goodwil is allocated to the relevant cash generating units

Goodwill arising on the acquisition of equity accounted entities is included in the cost of those entities and therefore not reported in the balance
sheet as goodwill

Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination are capitalised separately from goodwill if the fair value can be measured reliably
on initial recognition. Intangible assets acquired separately or development costs that meet the criteria to be capitalised are initially recognised
at cost and are assessed to have either a finite or indefinite useful life. Those with a finite life are amortised over their useful life and those
with an indefinite life are reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
value may be impaired, An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset
exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of an asset's net realisable value and its value in use.

Amortisation of intangible assets with finite lives is charged annually to the income statement. The useful lives of such intangible assets are in
the range of 1-6 years.

Research and development
Expenditure on research is written off in the year it is incurred, Development costs are capitalised where they meet the criteria required under
IFRSs. If these criteria are not met, then the costs are recognised in the income statement as they are incurred.

Property, plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment is recognised at cost, including attributable costs in bringing the asset into working condition for its intended
use. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is provided on a straight-line basis by reference to net book value and to the remaining
useful economic lives of assets and their estimated residual values. The useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually and adjustments,
where applicable, are made on a prospective basis. The lives assigned to major categories of property, plant and equipment are:

Range of asset lives

Land and buildings:

Freehold land Not depreciated
Freehold buildings Up to 50 years
Leasehold buildings The shorter of the period of the lease, 50 years or the estimated remaining useful life
Plant and machinery 3-15 years
Motor vehicles and trailers 1-12 years
Fixtures and equipment 2:45 years

An individual property that the Group has identified as surplus is reclassified within ‘non-current assets held for sale’, a separate category on
the balance sheet, when a sale is highly probable. This has been determined to be when authority to market the property has been approved
and the property is vacant and therefore available for immediate sale and occupation by a third party. Such properties are expected to
generate economic cash flow primarily by sale of the asset rather than by operational activities, and are expected generally to be disposed of
within a year.

FUJO0116857

Royal Mail Holdings plc

2. Accounting policies (continued)

For a disposal group of properties or other assets and liabilities, the requirements of IFRS 5 ‘Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued
operations’ are applied to the specific circumstances of the disposal group.

Impairment reviews
Unless otherwise disclosed in these accounting policies, assets are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying value may be impaired. The Group assesses at each reporting date whether such indications exist. Where appropriate, an
impairment loss is recognised in the income statement for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset (or cash generating unit)
exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of an asset's net realisable value and its value in use.

Leases

Finance leases, where substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the leased item have passed to the Group, are
capitalised at the inception of the lease with a corresponding liability recognised for the fair value of the leased item or, if lower, at the present
value of the minimum lease payments, Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of the lease liability to
achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the
estimated useful life of the asset and the lease term

Leases where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset are retained by the lessor, are classified as operating leases and
rentals are charged to the income statement over the lease term. The aggregate benefit of incentives are recognised as a reduction of rental
expenses over the lease term on a straight-line basis.

A leasehold land payment is an up-front payment to acquire a long-term leasehold interest in land, This payment is stated at cost and is
amortised on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.

Inventories
Inventories are carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value after adjusting for obsolete or slow-moving stock. Cost includes all costs in
bringing each item to its present location and condition and comprises weighted average cost for supplies and materials and purchase cost for
merchandise.

Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for any non-collectable amounts. An estimate for
doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable. Bad debts are written off when identified.

Financial instruments

Financial assets within the scope of IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’ are classified as; financial assets at fair value
through the income statement (held for trading); held to maturity investments, loans and receivables or available for sale financial assets as
appropriate. Financial liabilities within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as either financial liabilities at fair value through the income statement
or financial liabilities measured at amortised cost.

The Group determines the classification of its financial instruments at initial recognition and re-evaluates this designation at each financial year
end.

When financial instruments are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, being the transaction price plus, in the case of financial
instruments not at fair value through the income statement, any directly attributable transactional costs

The subsequent measurement of financial instruments depends on their classification as follows:

Financial assets at fair value through the income statement (held for trading)

Financial assets are classified as held for trading if they are acquired for sale in the short term. Derivatives are also classified as held for
trading unless they are designated as hedging instruments. Assets are carried in the balance sheet at fair value with gains or losses recognised
in the income statement,

Held-to-maturity investments
Non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturity are classified as ‘held to maturity’ when the Group has
the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity. Held to maturity investments are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate
method. Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the investments are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the
amortisation process. Investments intended to be held for an undefined period are not included in this classification

Loans and receivables

Non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted on an active market, do not qualify as trading assets
and have not been designated as either ‘fair value through the income statement’ or available for sale. Such assets are carried at amortised
cost using the effective interest rate method if the time value of money is significant. Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement
when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.

Available for sale financial assets
‘Available for sale financial assets’ are non-derivative financial assets that are designated as such or are not classified in any of the three
preceding categories. After initial recognition, interest is taken to the income statement using the effective interest rate method and the assets
are measured at fair value with gains or losses being recognised as a separate component of equity until the investment is derecognised, or
until the investment is deemed to be impaired at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously reported in equity is included in the income
statement.

Royal Mail Holdings plc

2. Accounting policies (continued)

Financial liabilities at fair value through the income statement (held for trading)
Derivatives liabilities are classified as held for trading unless they are designated as hedging instruments. They are carried in the balance sheet
at fair value with gains or losses recognised in the income statement.

Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost

All non-derivative financial liabilities are classified as financial liabilities measured at amortised cost. Non-derivative financial liabilities are
initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received, less directly attributable issue costs. After initial recognition, non-derivative
financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, Gains and losses are recognised in the
income statement when the liabilities are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.

Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits (cash equivalents) with an original
maturity date of three months or less. In addition, the Group uses Money Market funds as a readily available source of cash, which are bought
and sold on a daily basis to meet the cash requirements of the business. These funds are also categorised as cash equivalents

For the purpose of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of bank
overdrafts.

Cash equivalents are classified as loans and receivables financial instruments.

Financial assets - pension escrow investments
Financial assets ~ pension escrow investments comprise; short term deposits with banks; conventional gilt edged securities, index-linked git
edged securities and Treasury bills.

Short term deposits with banks (pension escrow investments) are classified as loans and receivables financial instruments.

Conventional gilt edged securities, index-linked gilt edged securities and Treasury bills are classified as available for sale financial instruments
on the basis that they are quoted investments that are not held for trading and may be disposed of prior to maturity.

Financial assets - other investments
Financial assets - other investments comprise; short term deposits (other investments) with Government, local government or banks with an
original maturity of three months or more. Short term deposits are classified as loans and receivables financial instruments.

Financial liabilities - interest-bearing loans and borrowings
All loans and borrowings are classified as financial liabilities measured at amortised cost. Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense when,
incurred.

Financial liabilities - obligations under finance lease and hire purchase contracts
All obligations under finance lease and hire purchase contracts are classified as financial liabilities measured at amortised cost.

Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense when incurred,

Derivative financial instruments
The Group uses derivative instruments such as foreign currency contracts in order to manage the risk profile of any underlying risk exposure of
the Group, in line with the Group's treasury management policies. Such derivative financial instruments are initially stated at fair value

For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as cash flow hedges where they hedge exposure to variability in cash flows that is
either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecasted transaction

In relation to cash flow hedges to hedge the foreign exchange risk of firm commitments that meet the conditions for hedge accounting, the
portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to relate to an effective hedge is recognised directly in equity and the
ineffective portion is recognised in the income statement.

When the hedged firm commitment results in the recognition of a non financial asset or non financial liability, then, at the time the asset or
liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of
the acquisition cost or other carrying amount of the asset or liability. For all other cash flow hedges, the gains or losses that are recognised in
equity are transferred to the income statement in the same year in which the hedged firm commitment affects the net profit/loss, for example
when the future sale actually occurs

For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are taken directly to the income
statement in the period.

Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge
accounting. At that point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is kept in equity until the forecast
transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to
the income statement for the year.

Royal Mail Holdings plc

2. Accounting policies (continued)

Fair value measurement of financial instruments

The fair value of quoted investments is determined by reference to bid prices at the close of business on the balance sheet date. Where there is
no active market, fair value is determined using valuation techniques. These include using recent arm's length market transactions; reference to
the current market value of another instrument which is substantially the same; and discounted cash flow analysis and pricing models
Specifically, in the absence of quoted market prices derivatives are valued by using quoted forward prices for the underlying commodity/currency
and discounted using quoted interest rates (both as at the close of business on the balance sheet date),

For the purposes of disclosing the fair value of investments held at amortised cost in the balance sheet, in the absence of quoted market prices,
fair values are calculated by discounting the future cash flows of the financial instrument using quoted equivalent interest rates as at close of
business on the balance sheet date

Derecognition of financial instruments
A financial asset or liability is derecognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires.

Income tax and deferred tax
The charge for current taxation is based on the results for the year as adjusted for items that are non-assessable or disallowed. itis calculated
using rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.

Deferred tax is provided, using the liability method, on all temporary differences at the balance sheet date, between the tax bases of assets and
liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.

Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences except
* initial recognition of goodwill;

* the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction,
affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or toss; and

. taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interest in joint ventures, where the timing of
the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the
foreseeable future

Other than stated below, deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry-forward of unused tax assets and
unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences,
carry-forward of unused tax assets, and unused tax losses can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are not recognised in respect of:

* deductible temporary differences arising from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business
combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor the taxable profit or loss; and

. deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, except to the
extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against
which the temporary difference will be utilised

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and increased or reduced to the extent that sufficient
taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the tax asset is realised or the
liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax
balances are not discounted.

Current and deferred tax is charged or credited directly to equity if it relates to items that are credited or charged directly to equity. Otherwise
it is recognised in the income statement.

Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, itis probable that an

outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. {f the effect
of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at an appropriate pre-tax rate

Pensions and other post-retirement benefits

The pension plans’ assets for the defined benefit schemes are measured at fair value. Liabilities are measured on an actuarial basis using the
projected unit credit method and discounted at a rate equivalent to the current rate of return on a high quality corporate bond of equivalent
currency and term. The resulting defined benefit asset or liability is presented separately on the face of the balance sheet. Full actuarial
valuations are carried out at intervals not normally exceeding three years as determined by the Trustees and, with appropriate updates and
accounting adjustments at each balance sheet date, form the basis of the deficit disclosed. All members of defined benefit schemes are
contracted out of the earnings-related part of the State pension scheme.

56
FUJ00116857
FUJO0116857

Royal Mail Holdings plc

2. Accounting policies (continued)

For defined benefit schemes, the amounts charged to operating profit are the current service costs and any gains and losses arising from
settlements, curtailments and past service costs. The net difference between the interest costs and the expected return on plan assets is
recognised as net pensions interest in the income statement. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in the statement of
recognised income and expense (SORIE). Any deferred tax movernent associated with the actuarial gains and losses is also recognised in the
SORIE.

For defined contribution schemes, the Group's contributions are charged to operating profit within people costs in the period to which the
contributions relate. Overseas subsidiaries make separate arrangements for the provision of pensions and other post-retirement benefits.

Foreign currencies
The functional and presentational currency of Royal Mail Holdings plc is sterling (£). The functional currency of the overseas subsidiaries in
Europe is mainly the euro (€).

The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. The trading results of
foreign operations are translated at the average rates of exchange for the reporting period, being a reasonable approximation to the actual
transaction rate. The exchange differences arising on the translation, since the date of transition to IFRSs, are taken directly to the Foreign

Currency Translation Reserve in equity.

Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency by applying the spot exchange rate ruling at the date of the
transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the functional currency rate of exchange
ruling at the balance sheet date. Currently hedge accounting is not claimed for any monetary assets and liabilities. All differences are therefore
taken to the income statement, except for differences on monetary assets and liabilities that form part of the Group's net investment in a
foreign operation. These are taken directly to equity until the disposal of the net investment occurs, at which time they are recognised in profit
or loss.

Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates
of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date
when the fair value is determined.

Contingent liabilities and financial guarantee contracts
Financial guarantee contracts are initially measured at fair value and subsequently at the higher of amounts under IAS 37 or the amounts
initially recognised less, when appropriate, cumulative amortisation recognised in accordance with IAS 18 ‘Revenue’

Contingent liabilities are not disclosed if the possibility of losses occurring is considered to be remote

Government grants
Government grants of a revenue nature are credited to the income statement and are shown separately to the expenditure to which they
relate

Segment information
The Group's primary reporting format is by business segments and its secondary reporting format is by geographical segments. The business
segments are organised and managed separately according to the nature of the products and services provided, with each segment
representing a business unit that offers different products and serves largely different markets. The five business segments are:

Royal Mail: Delivers letters to all addresses in the United Kingdom. Royal Mail offers a number of products to both business and domestic
users.

Parcetforce Worldwide: The parcels business unit operating within the UK
Post Office Limited: A limited company responsible for the network of Post Office branches offering a series of retail services
General Logistics Systems: The European parcels business which, via its subsidiaries and partners, offers its services in 36 European states

Other businesses: Includes PostCap Guernsey Limited and iRed Partnership Limited, both wholly owned subsidiaries, Romec Limited, and
NDC 2000 Limited, both part owned subsidiaries, investments in the following associates ~ Quadrant Catering Limited, Camelot Group plc
and Camelot International Services Limited, and our Group Property unit. The Group Property unit includes Royal Mail Estates Limited, a
wholly owned subsidiary.

Transfer prices between business segments are set on a basis of charges reached through negotiation with the respective businesses.

The two geographical segments are UK operations and European operations. The latter consists of the GLS business segment. The former
includes the other four business segments plus Corporate, representing central shared services for the UK and the corporate centre. Corporate
is not a revenue or profit centre but incurs certain costs on behalf of the business segments, which are passed on, and manages certain assets
and liabilities of the Group.

IFRS 2 Vesting Conditions and Cancellations

The amendment to IFRS 2 deals with vesting conditions and cancellations for shares. Although the Group operates the ColleagueShare
phantom share scheme (see policy note above) this does not constitute a share based payment arrangement under IFRS 2. Consequently the
Group has no share based payment arrangements, and therefore, this arnendment will have no impact on the financial position or performance
of the Group.

IFRS 3 Business Combinations

The Group does not anticipate early adopting the revised IFRS 3 and so will apply it prospectively to all business combinations on or after 29
March 2010. Whilst it is not possible to estimate the outcome of adoption, the key features of the revised IFRS 3 include a requirement for
acquisition-related costs to be expensed and not included in the purchase price; and for contingent consideration to be recognised at fair value
‘on the acquisition date (with subsequent changes recognised in the income statement and not as a change to goodwill). The standard also
changes the treatment of non-controlling interest (formerly minority interests) with an option to recognise these at full fair value as at the
acquisition date and a requirement for previously held non-controlling interests to be fair valued as at the date control is obtained, with gains
and losses recognised in the income statement.

The amendments to IFRS 7 require enhanced disclosures about fair value measurements and liquidity risk. The amendments will be adopted
with a commencement date of 30 March 2009 and will have no impact on the financial position or performance of the Group.

IFRS 8 Operating Segments

This standard requires disclosure of information about the Group's operating segments and replaces the requirement to determine primary
(business) and secondary (geographical) reporting segments. It is anticipated that the operating segments will be the same as the business
segments previously reported under IAS 14. This new standard will be adopted with a commencement date of 30 March 2009 and will have
no impact on the financial position or performance of the Group.

JAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements

This revised standard sets overall requirements for the presentation of financial statements, guidelines for their structure and minimum
requirements for their content. It does not change the recognition, measurement or disclosure of specific transactions and other events
required by other IFRSs. Hence it is expected that this new standard, which will be adopted with a commencement date of 30 March 20039, will
have no impact on the financial position or performance of the Group.

2. Accounting policies (continued)

IAS 23 Borrowing Costs
This standard has been revised to require capitalisation of borrowing costs when such costs relate to a qualifying asset. A qualifying asset is an
asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale. This new standard has had no impact on the
financial position or performance of the Group in the prior or current years although the standard will be adopted with a commencement date
of 30 March 2009, from when its application is likely to become relevant as the business continues to modernise its operations through
automation, using the investment provided by the Shareholder in the form of commercial loans.

IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements
IAS 27 revised is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009, with earlier application only permitted when the revised IFRS
3 is applied. The revised standard applies retrospectively with some exceptions. IAS 27 revised no longer restricts the allocation to minority
interest of losses incurred by a subsidiary to the amount of the non-controlling equity investment in the subsidiary. A partial disposal of equity
interest in a subsidiary that does not result in a loss of control will be accounted for as an equity transaction and will have no impact on
goodwill nor will it give rise to any gain or loss. Where there is loss of control of a subsidiary, any retained interest will have to be remeasured
to fair value, which will impact the gain or loss recognised on disposal. It is expected that this standard which will be adopted with a
commencement date of 29 March 2010, will have no impact on the financial position or performance of the Group.

IAS 32 & IAS 1 Puttable Financial Instruments and Obligations Arising on Liquidation
The amendments to IAS 32 & IAS 1 require that puttable financial instruments and instruments that impose an obligation to deliver to another
party a pro-rata share of net assets on liquidation are classified as equity provided that they have particular features and meet specific
conditions. It is expected that these amendments will be adopted with a commencement date of 30 March 2009 and will have no impact on
the financial position or performance of the Group.

IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement - Eligible Hedged Items
These amendments to IAS 39 were issued in August 2008 and become effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 July 2009. The
amendment addresses the designation of a one-sided risk in a hedged item, and the designation of inflation as a hedged risk or portion in
particular situations. It clarifies that an entity is permitted to designate a portion of the fair value changes or cash flow variability of a financial
instrument as hedged item. It is expected that this standard will have no impact on the financial position or performance of the Group.

Improvements to IFRSs

In May 2008 the IASB issued its first omnibus of amendments to its standards, primarily with a view to removing inconsistencies and clarifying
wording, There are separate transitional provisions for each standard. The Group has not yet adopted the following relevant amendments and
anticipates that these changes will have no material effect on the financial statements.

JERS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosure: Removal of reference to ‘total interest income’ as a component of finance cost.

© AS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements : Assets and liabilities classified as held for trading in accordance with IAS 39 Financial
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement are not automatically classified as current in the balance sheet.

© AS 8 Accounting Policies, Change in Accounting Estimates and Errors: Clarification that only implementation guidance that is an integral
part of an IFRS is mandatory when selecting accounting policies

© AS10 Events after the Reporting Period. Clarification that dividends declared after the end of the reporting period are not obligations.

© AAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment: Replace the term “net selling price” with “fair value less costs to sell’ Items of property, plant and
equipment held for rental that are routinely sold in the ordinary course of business after rental, are transferred to inventory when rental
ceases and they are held for sale

« JAS 18 Revenue: Replacement of the term ‘direct costs’ with ‘transaction costs’ as defined by IAS 39.

* AS 19 Employee Benefits: Revised the definition of ‘past service costs’, return on plan assets’ and ‘short term’ and ‘other long term’
employee benefits. Amendments to plans that result in a reduction in benefits related to future services are accounted for as curtailment.
Deleted the reference to the recognition of contingent liabilities to ensure consistency with IAS 37.

© AS 20 Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosures of Government Assistance: Loans granted in future with no or low interest
rates will not be exempt from the requirement to impute interest. The difference between the amount received and the discounted
amount is accounted for as government grant. Also, revised various terms used to be consistent with other IFRS.

«JAS 23 Borrowing Costs. The definition of borrowing costs is revised to consolidate the two types of items that are considered components
of ‘borrowing costs’ into one - the interest expense calculated using the effective interest rate method calculated in accordance with IAS
39,

© AS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements: When a parent entity accounts for a subsidiary at fair value in accordance with
IAS 39 in its separate financial statements, this treatment continues when the subsidiary is subsequently classified as held for sale.

© JAS 28 Investment in Associates: \f an associate is accounted for at fair value in accordance with IAS 39, only the requirement of IAS 28 to
disclose the nature and extent of any significant restrictions on the ability of the associate to transfer funds to the entity in the form of
cash or repayment of loans applies.

Royal Mail Holdings plc

2. Accounting policies (continued)

© AS 31 Interest in Joint ventures: If a joint venture is accounted for at fair value, in accordance with IAS 39, only the requirements of [AS
31 to disclose the commitments of the venturer and the joint venture, as well as surnmary financial information about the assets,
liabilities, income and expense will apply.

JAS 36 Impairment of Assets: When discounted cash flows are used to estimate ‘fair value less costs to sell’ additional disclosure is
required about the discount rate, consistent with disclosures required when the discounted cash flows are used to estimate ‘value in use’.

© AS 38 Intangible Assets: Expenditure on advertising and promotional activities is recognised as an expense when the Group either has the
right to access the goods or has received the service

© AS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement: Changes in circumstances relating to derivatives are not reclassifications
and therefore may be either removed from, or included in, the fair value through profit and loss’ classification after initial recognition
Removed the reference in IAS 39 to a ‘segment’ when determining whether an instrument qualifies as a hedge. Require the use of the
revised effective interest rate when remeasuring a debt instrument on the cessation of fair value hedge accounting

IFRIC 9 Amendment - Embedded Derivatives

This amendment to IFRIC 9 and IAS 39 clarifies the consequences if the fair value of an embedded derivative that would have to be separated
cannot be measured separately. The Group has no such embedded derivatives and hence there will be no impact on the financial position or
performance of the Group when this interpretation is adopted,

IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes
The Group has no schemes involving customer loyalty awards hence there will be no impact on the Group's financial statements when this
IFRIC is adopted.

IFRIC 15 Agreement for the Construction of Real Estate

IFRIC 15 was issued in July 2008 and becomes effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2009. The interpretation is to be
applied retrospectively. It clarifies when and how revenue and related expenses from the sales of a real estate unit should be recognised if an
agreement between a developer and a buyer is reached before the construction of the real estate is completed. Furthermore, the interpretation
provides guidance on how to determine whether an agreement is within the scope of IAS 11 or IAS 18. IFRIC 15 will not have an impact on the
consolidated financial statements because the Group does not conduct such activity.

IFRIC 16 Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation

IFRIC 16 was issued in July 2008 and becomes effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 October 2008. The interpretation is to be
applied prospectively. IFRIC 16 provides guidance on the accounting for a hedge of a net investment. As such it provides guidance on
identifying the foreign currency risks that qualify for hedge accounting in the hedge of a net investment, where within the group the hedging
instruments can be held in the hedge of a net investment and how an entity should determine the amount of foreign currency gain or loss,
relating to both the net investment and the hedging instrument, to be recycled on disposal of the net investment. The Group does not
undertake this activity and therefore this interpretation will not have an impact on the financial position or performance of the Group

IFRIC 17 Distributions of Non-Cash Assets to Owners

IFRIC 17 covers the accounting for the distribution of non-cash assets to the owners of an entity. The interpretation provides guidance as to
the valuation of such distributions, including where the owners are given a choice of cash or non-cash alternatives. The Group does not
undertake this form of activity and hence the interpretation will have no impact on the Group.

IFRIC 18 Transfers of Assets from Customers

IFRIC 18 provides guidance relating to an arrangement whereby an entity receives from a customer an item of property, plant and equipment
or the cash to construct an equivalent asset, to either connect the customer to a network or to provide the customer with ongoing access to a
supply of goods or services or to do both. Government grants and infrastructure used in a service concession arrangement are not applicable
to this interpretation. It is expected that this interpretation will be adopted with a commencement date of 29 March 2010 and will have no
impact on the financial position or performance of the Group

The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards, amendments and interpretations will have a material impact on the
Group's primary financial statements. Certain of the above standards will require amendment to disclosures in the period of initial application.

The £152m (2008 £313m) relates to a non-recurring Government grant received by the Group under the Industrial Development Act (IDA)
1982. This amount was used during the year to compensate Post Office Limited for providing certain specified “services of general economic
interest’

The £14m (2008 £116m) phantom share scheme costs and £70m (2008 £161m) stakeholder dividend costs are the estimated costs relating
to the Company ColleagueShare plan this year. The stakeholder dividend earned will be paid to qualifying employees in 2009-10 whilst the
costs of the phantom share scheme are discounted and will be redeemed by the Group by 2012.

The £113m (2008 £363m) restructuring charge is in respect of employee related redundancy costs of £113m (2008 £165m) resulting mainly
from operational efficiency initiatives in Royal Mail and in Post Office Limited. There were also exceptional write-backs relating to property in
the Group of £4m (2008 £10m charge) offset by other Group restructuring exceptional charges of £4m (2008 £4m) during the year. Last
year’s additional restructuring charge related to subpostmasters’ compensation paid through the Agency Network Change (ANC) programme
(2008 £141m) and project fees for the WH Smith and the ANC programmes (2008 £43m).

Impairments of £77m (2008 £91m) relate to Post Office Limited comprising £38m (2008 £40m) property, plant and equipment and £39m
(2008 £51m) intangible assets. Due to ongoing losses, the carrying values of asset purchases made by Post Office Limited during the year
have been impaired to their recoverable amount.

Other exceptional write-offs of £27m (2008 £17m) include £18m (2008 £9rn) relating to professional fees in connection with Government
funding and £9m (2008 £8m) for other restructuring items charged in the current year.

The Group has unrecognised deferred tax assets of £2,373m (2008 £816m), comprising £1.892m (2008 £338m) relating to the retirement
benefit obligation, £228m (2008 £289m) relating mainly to fixed asset timing differences, and £253m (2008 £189m) relating to tax losses in
subsidiaries that are available to offset against future taxable profits. The Group has capital losses carried forward, the tax effect of which is
£22m (2008 £16m) and temporary differences related to capital losses of £108m. The Group has rolled over capital gains of £72m (2008
£74m); no tax liability would be expected to crystallise should the assets into which the gains have been rolled be sold at their residual value,
as it is anticipated that a capital loss would arise. The adverse tax effect of the phased abolition of Industrial Buildings Allowances has resulted
in a reduction of the Group's deferred tax asset by £108m and a corresponding amount has been recorded within the current year’s income
statement tax charge

At 29 March 2009, there was no recognised or unrecognised deferred income tax liability (2008 Enil) for taxes that would be payable on the
unremitted earnings of certain of the Group's subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures, as the Group has no liability to additional taxation
should such amounts be remitted due to the availability of double taxation relief or other exemptions and reliefs.

The carrying value of goodwill arising on business combinations of £206m (2008 £173m) at the balance sheet date includes £205m (2008
£172m) relating to the General Logistics Systems (GLS) business segment In line with the accounting policy (see note 2), this goodwill has
been reviewed for impairment. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the carrying value of an asset or cash generating
unit exceeds the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of net realisable value and value in use. The carrying value of GLS,
excluding interest bearing and tax related assets and liabilities, is £471m (2008 £369m) at year end (see note 3) and the operating profit
before exceptional items is £124m (2008 £114m) for the year (see note 3). The carrying value represents a multiple of 3.8 (2008 3.2) on
operating profit before exceptional items. The net realisable value of GLS, for the purposes of the impairment review (ie. the ‘fair value less
costs to sell’), has been assessed with reference to earnings multiples for quoted entities in a similar sector. On this basis, the net realisable
value of GLS has been assessed to be in excess of the carrying value. No reasonable possible change in the earnings multiples referenced

would reduce the net realisable value to below the carrying value.

On 1 August 2008 the General Logistics Systems (GLS) subsidiary acquired certain assets of Belluno and Padua franchise area businesses
in Italy. If these combinations had taken place at the beginning of the financial year, Group revenue from continuing operations would
have been £9,565m. The goodwill of £2m arising on these acquisitions is indicative of the relative quality of the acquired entities

On 9 March 2009 the Romec Limited subsidiary acquired 100% of MOP Engineering Limited. If this combination had taken place at the
beginning of the financial year, Group revenue from continuing operations would have increased by a further £1m to £9,566m,

Combined profits of the acquired entities since their respective acquisition dates and if they had been acquired at the beginning of the

Other than cash in the Post Office Limited network and in hand of £731m (2008 £938m), the cash and cash equivalent balances of £329m
(2008 £489m) are interest bearing. Cash at bank of £96m (2008 £138m) earns interest at either floating or short-term fixed rates based
upon bank deposit rates. Short-term deposits of £233m (2008 £351m) are made for varying periods of between one day and three months
depending on the immediate cash requirements of the Group, and earn interest at the respective short-term deposit rates. The fair value of
cash and cash equivalent investments is not materially different from the carrying value of £1,060m (2008 £1,427m).

The £1,427m cash and cash equivalents balance in 2007-08 does not include a £7m overdrawn bank balance relating to the General Logistics
Systems (GLS) subsidiary. This £7m is included in the Financial liabilities - interest bearing loans and borrowings balance of £289m in the
2007-08 balance sheet. The £7m overdrawn bank balance has been repaid during the 2008-09 financial year.

2011.

The security in place in the previous year was as disclosed above.

‘The BERR loans to Royal Mail Group Ltd and Post Office Limited become repayable immediately on the occurrence of an event of default
under the loan agreements. These events of default include non-payment, insolvency and breach of covenant relating to interest and total

Restructuring

The provision for restructuring principally comprises redundancy schemes of £108m (2008 £117m). The remainder relates to onerous
property and commercial contracts associated with restructuring projects.

The timing of cash flows for such provisions is by its nature uncertain and dependent upon the outcome of related events.

Employee Costs
Royal Mail operates a phantom share scherne referred to as ColleagueShere. This is a five-year scheme running to March 2012. The
provision at 29 March of £134m (2008 £116m) represents the potential liability for the financial years up to 2011-12 and has been
discounted to recognise the long-term nature of the scheme.

Other
Other provisions of £37m (2008 £24m) are those recognised principally for the expected liabilities arising from property exits in the normat
course of business. These principally comprise onerous lease obligations and decommissioning costs. Further provision amounts arise from
estimated exposures resulting from legal claims.

In the main, provision amounts are expected to be utilised in 2009-10 with the remainder within 2 to 3 years except for £134m relating to

ColleagueShare, expected to be utilised within 4 years and £2m of onerous property contracts, expected to be utilised over a period longer
than 5 years.

24. Financial risk management objectives and policies

The Group's principal financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise short-term deposits, money market liquidity investments,
Government gilt edged securities, loans, finance leases and hire purchase contracts and cash. The main purposes of these financial instruments
are to raise finance and manage the liquidity needs of the business operations. The Group has various other financial instruments such as

trade debtors and trade creditors, which arise directly from operations.

The Group enters into derivative transactions, principally commodity swaps and forward currency contracts. The purpose is to manage the
commodity and currency risks arising from the Group’s operations.

Itis, and has been throughout the year under review, the Group's policy that no speculative trading in financial instruments shall be

undertaken,

The main risks arising from the Group's financial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk, foreign currency risk, commodity price and

credit risk. The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.

Interest rate risk

The Group’s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to the Group's debt obligations and interest bearing financial assets.
The BERR loans to Royal Mail Group Ltd of £800m (2008 £500m) are at a fixed interest rate to maturity with an average maturity date of
2020 (2008 - average date of 2023). The BERR loans to Post Office Limited of £232m (2008 £280m) are at short-dated fixed interest rates -
average maturity 1 day (2008 average 1 day). The total interest bearing financial assets of the group (excluding the pension escrow
investments) of £336m (2008 £510m) are at short-dated fixed or variable interest rates with average maturity 9 days (2008 average 12

days). These short-dated financial instruments are maturity managed to obtain the best value out of the interest yield curve.

The Group's policy is to manage its net interest expense using an appropriate mix of fixed and variable rate financial instruments. No external

hedging of interest rate risk is undertaken.

The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to reasonably possible changes in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the

Group's profit before taxation and equity based upon the financial instruments held at the balance sheet date

The effect from available for sale (whether floating or fixed rate) financial assets is calculated as the change in fair value at the balance sheet

date and impacts equity.

The effect from other floating rate financial instruments is calculated as the balance of the instruments multiplied by the change in interest
rates and impacts profit before taxation.

There is no effect on either profit before taxation or equity from other financial instruments.

Effect of a decrease in GBP interest rates of 50 basis points (0.5%) (a) 86 (2) 33

Foreign currency risk

The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk due to trading with overseas postal operators for carrying UK mail abroad and delivering foreign
origin mail in the UK, the balances held to operate the Bureau de Change services within Post Office Limited and various purchase contracts
denominated in foreign currency. These risks are mitigated by hedging programmes managed by Group Treasury. Where possible, exposures
are netted internally and any remaining exposure is hedged using a combination of external spot and forward contracts. Hedging will not
normally be considered for exposures of less than £1m; hedging is normally confined to 80% of the forecast exposure where forecast cash
flows are highly probable

The Group's obligation to settle with overseas postal operators is denominated in Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) - a basket of currencies
comprising of US Dollar (USS), Japanese Yen, Sterling and euro. Group Treasury operates a rolling 18-month hedge programme, which is
subsequently reviewed on a quarterly basis. There has been no external SOR hedge in place throughout the financial year 2008-09 due to
there being no material net exposure.

For the Bureau de Change business, balances of major currency holdings are hedged along with minor currencies showing a closely correlated
movement.

The Group's obligations to settle conveyance charges in USS has been hedged (to April 2011)
The Group has four active hedge programmes covering obligations to settle euro invoices on automation projects.

The Group does not hedge the translation exposure created by the net assets of its overseas subsidiaries. However it does hedge the
transactional exposure created by inter-company loans with these subsidiaries.

The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to reasonably possible changes in exchange rates, with all other variables held constant, of the
Group's profit before taxation and equity based upon the financial instruments held at the balance sheet date

The effect from financial instruments owned by GLS denominated in foreign currency and held at amortised cost in the balance sheet is
calculated as the balance of the instruments multiplied by the change in exchange rates and impacts equity.

The effect from other financial instruments denominated in foreign currency and held at amortised cost in the balance sheet is calculated as
the balance of the instruments multiplied by the change in exchange rates and impacts profit.

The effect from derivative assets and liabilities is calculated as the change in fair value at the balance sheet date and impacts equity (for
derivatives within an effective hedging relationship) or profit before taxation for ineffective hedges and derivatives not designated in hedging
relationships.

There is no effect on either profit before taxation or equity from other financial instruments.

Commodity price risk

The Group is exposed to fuel price risk arising from operating one of the largest vehicle fleets in Europe, which consumes over 140 million
litres of fuel per year, and a jet fuel price risk arising from the purchasing of air freight services. The Group's fuel risk management strategy
aims to reduce uncertainty created by the movements in the oil and foreign currency markets. The strategy uses over-the-counter derivative
products (in both USS commodity price and USS/Sterling exchange rate) to manage these exposures.

In addition, the Group is exposed to the commodity price risk of purchasing electricity and gas. The Group's risk management strategy aims to
reduce uncertainty created by the movements in the electricity and gas markets. These exposures are managed by locking into fixed rate price
contracts with suppliers and using over-the-counter derivative products to manage these exposures.

The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to reasonably possible changes in commodity prices, with all other variables held constant, of
the Group's profit before taxation and equity based upon the financial instruments held at the balance sheet date

The effect from derivative assets and liabilities is calculated as the change in fair value at the balance sheet date and impacts equity (for
derivatives within an effective hedging relationship) or profit before taxation for ineffective hedges and derivatives not designated in hedging
relationships.

There is no effect on either profit before taxation or equity from other financial instruments.

Credit risk

Royal Mail operates a Credit Policy, which provides a fair and equitable arrangement for all its account customers. The level of credit granted is
based on a customer's risk profile assessed by an independent credit referencing agent. The Credit Policy is applied rigidly within the regulated
products area so as to ensure that Royal Mail is not in breach of compliance legislation. Assessment of credit for the non-regulated products is
based on commercial factors, which are commensurate with the Group's appetite for risk

Royal Mail has a dedicated credit management team, which sets and monitors credit limits, and takes corrective action as and when
appropriate. Credit controls in place have limited the level of bad debt incurred to around 0.1% (2008 0.2%) of turnover.

With respect to credit risk arising from other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash, cash equivalent investments, available for sale
financial assets, held to maturity financial assets, held for trading financial assets, loans and receivables financial assets and certain derivative
instruments, the Group invests/trades only with high quality financial institutions. The Group's exposure to credit risk arises from default of the
counterparty, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of these instruments.

There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.

Liquidity risk

The Group's primary objective is to ensure that the Group has sufficient funds available to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. This is
achieved by aligning short-term investments and borrowing facilities with forecast cash flows. Typical short-term investments include money
market funds, time deposits with approved counterparties, UK Government gilts and Treasury bills. Borrowing facilities are regularly reviewed
to ensure continuity of funding,

The unused facilities for Royal Mail Group Ltd of £900m expire in 2014 (2008 £1,200m expiring between 2014 and 2016). The unused
facility for Post Office Limited of £918m (2008 £870m) expires in 2021. Additionally, the Group has £200m (2008 £300m) of uncommitted
lines of credit which are reviewed annually.

Capital management

Royal Mail Holdings plc is a public limited company which is not traded and regards its capital as share capital, share premium, retained
earnings and debt provided by the UK Government. The sole shareholder and the provider of the majority of debt to the Group is the UK
Government. The management of capital is closely linked to the Group's relationship with its Shareholder. The Group maintains its liquidity
requirements by the management of its internal funds and by the drawing down of equity and debt from its Shareholder as well as drawing on
limited external debt facilities. The Group's debt to equity ratio is determined by its Shareholder.

Financial assets - pension escrow investments

On 23 March 2007, Royal Mail Holdings plc and Royal Mail Group Ltd established £1bn of investments in escrow. These investments are held
as security to the Royal Mail Pension Plan in support of the 17 year deficit recovery period from March 2006. At 29 March 2009, Royal Mail
Holdings plc had £940m (2008 £909m) of investments in the pension escrow and Royal Mail Group Ltd had £166m (2008 £161m). Charges
over these assets have been registered. Further details on the Royal Mail Pension Plan, including the latest full actuarial valuation, are
contained in note 26

Carrying amounts and fair values

Set out below is a summary by category of the carrying amounts of all the Group's financial instruments. Trade debtors, creditors,

FUJ00116857
FUJ00116857

prepayments, accruals and client creditors have been omitted from this analysis on the basis that carrying value is a reasonable approximation
for fair value. Pension scheme assets and liabilities are also excluded. Fair values have been calculated using current market prices (forward
exchange rates/commodity prices) and discounted using appropriate discount rates. There are no material differences between the fair value
(transaction price) of all financial instruments at initial recognition and the fair value calculated using these valuation techniques. The fair value
of the BERR loans to Royal Mail Group Limited is £875m at 29 March 2009 (2008 £507m). The fair value of ‘Obligations under finance leases

and hire purchase contracts’ is £1116m (2008 £53m). For all other financial instruments fair value is equal to the carrying amount

Hedging Activities

The Group had the following designated cash flow hedge programmes during the current and previous financial year:

i) The diesel fuel hedge programme uses forward commodity price swaps and forward currency purchase contracts to hedge the exposure
arising from commodity price and USS/GBP exchange rates for forecast diesel fuel purchases.

ii) The air conveyance hedge programme uses USS and euro forward currency purchase contracts to hedge the exposure arising from

USS/GBP and GBP/euro exchange rates for forecast air conveyance purchases

iii) Four capital programmes using euro forward currency purchase contracts to hedge the exposure arising from GBP/euro exchange rates
for contracted capital expenditure on automation projects

iv) The electricity hedge programme uses forward commodity price swaps to hedge the exposure arising from electricity prices.

v) The gas hedge programme uses forward commodity price swaps to hedge the exposure arising from gas prices

26. Employee benefits - pensions

The Group operates pension schemes as detailed below.

Scheme Eligibility Type

Royal Mail Pension Plan (RMPP) UK employees Defined benefit
Royal Mail Senior Executive Pension Plan (RMSEPP) UK senior executives Defined benefit
Royal Mail Retirement Savings Plan (RMRSP) UK employees Defined contribution
Royal Mail Defined Contribution Plan (RMDCP) UK employees Defined contribution
Various other small-scale schemes operated by overseas

subsidiaries Overseas subsidiary employees Defined contribution

Defined Contribution
A charge for the defined contribution schemes of £2m (2008 £2m) was recognised in operating profit before exceptional items within the
income statement. The Company contributions to these schemes was £2m (2008 £2m). A new defined contribution plan (RMDCP) was
launched in April 2009. New recruits joining from 31 March 2008 will be able to begin paying contributions to the new plan after they have
worked for the Company for a year.

Defined Benefit
Both RMPP and RMSEPP are funded by the payment of contributions to separate trustee administered funds. The latest full actuarial
valuations of both schemes have been carried out as at 31 March 2006 using the projected unit method. For RMPP, this valuation has been
concluded at £3.4bn deficit. For RMSEPP, the valuation has been concluded at £43m deficit. A series of changes to RMPP and RMSEPP
began to take effect on 1 Aprit 2008.

The changes encompass:
the Plan closed to new members from 31 March 2008;

all pensions and benefits earned before 1 April 2008 are still inked to final salary at the time of retirement;

© from 4 April 2008, defined benefits building up for employee members of the Plan are earned on a career salary basis;

© employees can continue to take their pension on reaching 60 but the normal retirement age will increase to 65 for benefits earned
from 1 April 2010; and

© from 4 April 2010 it will be possible to draw pension earned before the change to normal retirement age at 60, and continue working
while still contributing to the Pension Plan until the maximum level of benefits has been reached

26. Employee benefits - pensions (continued)

Payment of £549m (2008 £548m) was made during the year in respect of regular future service contributions, with £543m (2008 £542m)
relating to RMPP. The regular future service contributions for RMPP, expressed as a percentage of pensionable pay, has remained at 20.0%,
effective from April 2006. This rate is not expected to change materially during 2009-10. For RMSEPP, these contributions have remained
at 48.2% (2008 48.2%).

Payment of £290m (2008 £284m) was made during the year to fund the deficit in the schemes, with £285m (2008 £276m) relating to
RMPP. Deficit recovery payments are planned for RMPP over the 17 years from the date of the latest full actuarial valuation. These
payments will be made before each 31 March, and may therefore span across the Group's year end (the last Sunday in March). Over the 16
years from 31 March 2007, planned deficit payments are £260m per annum, increasing in line with RPI (base year is 2006-07). For
RMSEPP, deficit recovery payments will be £5m per annum from 1 April 2007 to 31 December 2015.

Accurrent liability of £8m (2008 £7m) has been recognised for payments to the pension schemes relating to redundancy (see note 22).
During the year, payments of £32m (2008 £36m) relating to redundancy were made.

On 23 March 2007, the Group established £1bn of investments in escrow as security to the Royal Mail Pension Plan in support of the 17
year deficit recovery period.

The following disclosures relate to the gains/losses and deficit in the schemes recognised for the RMPP and RMSEPP defined benefit plans in
the financial statements of the Group:

a) Major assumptions

The size of the pension deficit, which is large in the context of the Group and its finances, is materially sensitive to the assumptions
adopted. Small changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the deficit and overall income statement charge. The
major assumptions were:

‘At 29 March 2009 At 30 March 2008
%pa pa

Rate of increase in salaries 42 46

Rate of increase in pensions and deferred pensions 32 36

Discount rate 64 65

inflation assumption 3.2 36

Expected average rate of return on assets 6.9 68

The above assumptions relate to both defined benefit plans with the exception of the expected average rate of return on assets which is
computed for the combined assets of the plans. The expected average rate of return on assets is a weighted average of the long-term
expected rate of return of each principal asset class (see section b). The expected average rate of return is computed at each balance sheet
date based on the market values and long-term rate of return of each principal asset class as at that date.

Mortality

The mortality assumptions for the larger scheme are based on the 1992 series mortality tables allowing for ‘medium cohort’ projections of
future improvements. These are detailed below:

Average expected life expectancy from age 60 2009 2008
For a current 60 year old male RMPP member 26 years 26 years
For a current 60 year old female RMPP member 29 years 29 years
For a current 40 year old male RMPP member 28 years 28 years
For a current 40 year old female RMPP member 31 years 31 years

There is no element of the above present value of liabilities that arises from plans that are wholly unfunded

Certain of the above investments relate to properties occupied by the Group, but the contribution of these properties to the fair value of plans’
assets is not material. The pension plans have not invested in any other assets used by the Group or in the Group's own financial instruments.

those people paid compensation in respect of redundancy during the accounting period. Such payments may occur in an accounting

period subsequent to the recognition of costs in the income statement

e) History of experience gains and losses

The cumulative amount of actuarial gains and losses recognised since transition to IFRSs at 29 March 2004 in the statement of recognised
income and expense is £3,194m loss (2008 £890m gain). The Directors are unable to determine how much of the pension scheme deficit
recognised in transition to IFRSs is attributable to actuarial gains and losses since inception of the pension schemes. Consequently, the
Directors are unable to determine the cumulative amount of actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognised in the statement of

recognised income and expense between inception of the pension schemes and transition to IFRSs

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities in relation to the parent Company financial statements

The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations

Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have elected to
prepare the financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting
Standards and applicable law). The financial statements are required by law to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company
and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period. In preparing those financial statements, the Directors are required to:

* select suitable accounting policies and apply them consistently;
© make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;

© state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in
the financial statements; and

© prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in
business.

The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy, at any time, the financial position
of the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial staternents comply with the Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible for
safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other
irregularities.

Notes to the parent Company accounts

1. Parent Company accounting pol
The following accounting policies apply:

Financial year
The financial year ends on the last Sunday in March and, accordingly, these accounts are made up to the 52 weeks ended 29 March
2009 (53 weeks ended 30 March 2008)

Basis of preparation
The parent Company's financial statements were authorised for issue by the Board on 13 May 2009

The accounts on pages 100 to 102 have been prepared in accordance with applicable UK Accounting Standards and law, including the
requirements of the Companies Act 1985. Unless otherwise stated in the accounting policies below, the accounts have been prepared
under the historic cost accounting convention.

In making an assessment on Royal Mail Holdings plc's ability to continue as a going concern, the Directors have considered the
assessments made by the subsidiaries Royal Mail Group Ltd and Post Office Limited, These are set out in note 2 to the Group accounts
On this basis the Directors have concluded that it is appropriate that the Royal Mail Holdings plc company accounts have been prepared
‘on a going concern basis.

Royal Mail Holdings plc {the Company) has not presented its own profit and loss account, as permitted by the Companies Act s230 (3).
However, the results of the Company for the year are disclosed in notes 6 and 9 to the accounts.

The Company has taken advantage of paragraph 2D of FRS 29 (IFRS 7) Financial Instruments: Disclosures and has not disclosed
information required by that standard, as the Group's consolidated financial statements in which the Company is included, provide
equivalent disclosures for the Group under IFRS 7

No new UK Accounting Standards, which affect the presentation of these accounts, have been issued.

Impairment reviews

Unless otherwise disclosed in these accounting policies, fixed assets are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. The Company assesses at each reporting date whether such indications exist. Where
appropriate, an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset (or cash
generating unit) exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of an asset's net realisable value and its value in use.

Investments in subsidiaries

Investments in subsidiaries within the Company's accounts are stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. The opening and
closing carrying value relates solely to the Company's investment in Royal Mall Group Ltd, a 100% subsidiary of the Company. Royal
Mail Group Ltd is the only direct shareholding held by the Company,

Investments in pension escrow
Investments in pension escrow are financial assets within the scope of FRS 26 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.

The investments are a combination of short-term deposits and long-term investments which mature between 8 days and 47 years but
have been included within fixed assets as the investments have been provided as security to the Royal Mail Pension Plan in support of
the 17 year deficit recovery period from March 2006

The investments comprise short-term deposits with a bank, Treasury bills and gilt edged securities

The bank deposits are non-derivative assets that are neither held for trading nor quoted in an active market and therefore classified as
‘loans and receivables’ for measurement purposes under FRS 26 (Financial instruments: Recognition and Measurement). The
investments are initially recognised at fair value, being the amount deposited. The investments accrue interest, thereby increasing the
carrying value of the investments. This interest is included in the reported profit/(loss) for the year. The investments are derecognised
when they mature

Treasury bills, index-linked gilt edged securities and conventional gilt edged securities are classified as available for sale financial
instruments on the basis that they are quoted investments that are not held for trading and may be disposed of prior to maturity. The
investments are initially recognised at fair value, being the purchase price. After initial recognition, interest is included in the reported
profit/(loss) for the year, using the effective interest rate method and the assets are measured at fair value with gains or losses being
recognised in the Financial Assets Reserve until the investment is derecognised

Contingent liabilities
Contingent liabilities are not disclosed if the possibility of tosses occurring is considered to be remote.

2. Directors’ emoluments

The Directors of the Company are not paid fees by the Company for their services as Directors of the Company. The Directors of the
Company are paid fees by other companies of the Group. These emoluments are disclosed in the Group accounts.

3. Auditor's remuneration

The auditor of the Company is not paid fees by the Company. The auditor of the Company is paid fees by the other companies of the
Group. This remuneration is disclosed in the Group accounts.
