I am free but you'll need someone like Gareth to give you a definitive answer, it was his idea after all.

I think the answer is that Giro bank is ALSO an AP transaction (like bill payments). It is the only type of
bank account that is. All other banking deposits go through a totally different path.

Steve,

Thank you for this. Updated version attached. We are down to one point to bottom out, which is the GIRO bank
theory in para. 35. The bit we are struggling with is that it if it is possible to deposit money in a Giro bank account, how
is it not possible to deposit money in a normal account. Why is a paper slip necessary for this type of account?

It might be worth having a quick call on this. Are you free?

Kind regards

Thank you for this.

I'm working on the statement now — next (and hopefully final version) will be with you within 30 minutes. We need to
get it out today, so please can you review on receipt? I'll send you a comparison so you can easily see the changes
made.

Kind regards

Jonny, we’ve been looking at some potential examples to use within the witness statement. Suggest WBD
have a look and decide if it is useful to add them as examples?

Effective Software Fixes

pcooss9is:; PSteed2847N - reverse a rem, but when this has been
reversed it is doubling up on a balance

+ve: Already mentioned in statement but still shows a quick software error turn round

28/04/03: SSC (Paul Steed) identified error

28/04/03: Paul Steed updated and sent to MSU to handle discrepancy with FAD & POL

30/04/03: Development identify error

01/05/03: Work Package generated: PWY_WP_16353 B3S30R

07/05/03: Tested on LST. Fix released.

09/05/03: I have spoken to the PM to say that the software fix was sent down and became active on 07-May-2003
and so there should be no recurrences of the original problem.

WBD_001271.000004
WBONO0001401
WBONO0001401

pcoi23699: 28/07/05 ...payments and receipts are mismatched...PM
states he was balancing on node 2 but there was discrepancies...

-ve: Initial SSC response was erroneous, to send back to Helpdesk.

+ve: Fast fix to live for financial issue

+ve: Demonstrates passing to MSU to tie up financial impact with POL

+ve: Example of looking at more than one site, diligence identifying other sites with issue

+ve: Shows how an initial R&P error is seen by PM and support are subsequently able to identify other events that
tie it in to other sites

28/07/05: Incorrectly sent back by SSC ...Balancing problems should be dealt with initially by NBSC...
28/07/05: ...Have spoken with the PM and advised...All that remains now is for us to try and identify the root cause
of the discrepancy which may take a while. As per usual we will forward our findings on to the MSU who will advise
POL accordingly...
29/07/05 With development. Work Package PWY_WP_22602 generated
01/08/05: BI3S80R_WP22602 is now ready for test
02/08/05: Release PinICL PCO123865
his has passed testing in LST and is being returned to RM for live pilot.
; sent out to the Pilot 100 successfully
05/09/05: Applied to all live outlets and now in the live Generic Prodlists roll-outs using both $70 and S80 spares

When the PM went to produce a trail balance a discrepancy was shown but at the bottom the receipts and
payment totals did not match.

The £170 discrepancy was down to an APS txn message that had no product number and no primary or secondary
mappings. There was a critical event raised on 21st Jul on counter 9 which helped to identify this (Event Id:4 with
the text "Error Message: Failed to generate EPOSSCore transaction grammar").

As the txn message was incomplete it was omitted from the rollover ‘calculations’ and thus caused the discrepancy
reported.

When I checked the tivoli event archives yesterday I found that 216 of these events had been logged in the past 7
days at different offices/counters

Looks like whenever the event is raised it is either down to a cancelled quantum txn

Have checked out a sample of 40 to 50 sites and they're all at S80 so its probably safe to assume its an S80
problem.
