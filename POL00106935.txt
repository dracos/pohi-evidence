04/02/04 IRB starts at Bowburn and is assisted by PO Trainer J Wilson for two weeks. This training 38.24
iwas considered inadequate and inappropriate. The trainer focused on being courteous to
customers rather than checking other essential tasks like checking end of day reports.
During this week Unusable notes were sent to Leeds Cash Centre. See entry under 31
March 2004, (Another trainer Dave took over for a day to cover JW’s absence)
12/02/04 — During this week we lost £1043.32.This was due to cheques being sent to the wrong 1043,32
processing centre. I was expected to settle this amount personally! After the intervention ofI
the Retail Line Manager (RLM) Lesley Joyce, the money was put into suspense.

Incident 1)___ Friday 11" February 2005 at 09:05 §7

Customer put A&L Card into pin pad and requested £100. Horizon system authorised
transaction on screen. Assistant paid money and handed over the receipt. (It has not been
jour practice to look at the customer's receipt when a balance is requested or after a cash
withdrawl).

A little later the customer returns and presents the receipt. The receipt shows the
transaction has been declined by the customer's card.

As the customer has the £100 cash, the card is swiped to settle the account.

IAt 10:21 a balance check for the customer indicates £2147-31. Customer says it should be
£2247-31.

At 10:23 09 £100 is deposited back inte the customer's account by swiping the card.
A balance check at 10:23 59 confirms the customers expectation of £2247-31.

At 10:29 R Bilkhu (RB) runs of transaction reports and On-line banking reports.
These confirm that no money left the customer's account at 09:05 i.e. value Of 0.0
is recorded. The second swipe of the card had registered a withdrawal of £100.

At 10:41 RB contacts Helpline on option 3 and explains the above to Lynsey Brook.

POL00106935
POL00106935

A reference number H13804619 is issued.

On Monday 14/02/05 Joan from A&L rings and confirms that someone will ring on
15/02/05. Sue Lincoln rings on 15/02/05. An explanation is offered to the effect that once
cash is requested, that sum is taken out of the account by the system to prevent a
duplicate transaction. Usually the system rights itself in 24 hours.

IRB was given various other telephone numbers e.g. Helen Hark at Chesterfield on!

L

On 18/02/05 the customer came in to collect his benefit and confirmed that he had
received a statement and everything appeared to be in order.

Customer requests £60 using his PO Card Account Card. Transaction is authorised as
normal on the screen and the Assistant hands over the cash. Customer then asks for a
receipt. Assistant then realises that the system had not generated a receipt. She presses
‘Receipt’ on keyboard but the receipt issued is of a previous transaction (sale of postage
stamps).

R Bilkhu was on holiday that day but on his return the following day he is made aware of

the incident and runs off transaction records. These confirm that this particular transaction

POL00106935
POL00106935

did not take place.

RB contacts Malcolm at helpline. Malcoim requests the number of the PO card so the
withdrawl can be confirmed. This is obtained _] from the customer and
passed over to Malcolm. Malcolm is able to co! ioney left the customers
account on that day.

Quizzed by RB as to how often does this sort of thing happen i.e. screen prompt displays
‘Transaction Authorised’ but in fact it is not registered by the system.

‘Not very often’ was the answer.

Quite separately RB had asked the customer to ring PO Card Account and request a
statement. This the customer did and a few days later came in to confirm that no money
had left his account and offered his card to settle.

their equivalent. Sheila wanted to connect me to Service Support. I told her there was no
point as I had already spoken to them and nothing had been done.

Jeanette rang from Horizon-a lengthy discussion followed. I explained the issues and
lexpressedmy frustration that no one was willing to help. Jeanette confirmed:

a) that as the role of the RLM had disappeared no one else was available

b) but more alarmingly that there were ‘hundreds of issues with on-line

Ran out of cash (in part due to reduced rem deliveiries from twice a week to once a week).
Rang Manchester Cash Centre and spoke to Richard. All blamed on the computer! Told
him don’t blame it on the computer-the man sitting behind it is supposed to be watching
that Bowburn is running out of cash and he/she should be doing something about it! Asked
Richard what should I do now. He said I should close the PO down! I reminded him that
the PO carries out one single core activity and that is it handles cash-we give cash out to
customers and take cash from customers. If we can’t get that right we might as well lock
up and go home. It was up to people like Richard (and his subordinates) to ensure the
cash deliveries were managed competently and all other factors like larger demands for
cash since the introduction of the PO card account and the fact that we have lost some
business customers should be taken into account. We are trying to get customers into the
PO and Richard is asking me to close and ask the customers to go elsewhere!

Needless to say, I now have to ensure that I have sufficient cash — I check the planned
delivery and every week I have increase the amount they have planned.

Rollover Issues

Two ‘phone calls made to Helpline as follows:

On Option 2 @ about 18:40. Spoke to Sandra. Explained to her that I had got so far in the
balancing but could not rollover into TP7. She said because of the discrepancy I was in
breach of contract. I should close and go home and would not be able to serve tomorrow. [
‘told her that the discrepancy was an on-going issue and there was currently a dispute with
the POL and was being dealt with via NFSP and as a result I did not see how I was in
breach of contract when there was clearly a dispute.

I said, whilst the dispute continued, I wanted to continue serving tomorrow and in order to
do so could I stay in TP6 or BPO1? She said she would contact me in the morning and
asked when I was available. I said I was available as and when required.

‘A time for her to ring me was arranged for 0800. I was on the premises at 07:15.

She never rang.

Qn Option 3_@ about 19:30. Spoke to Joanne and explained the rollover issues and
asked to consider putting the shortage in suspense so I could continue serving the
following day.She said she could not authorise that and her superior would contact me by
2200. I gave her my home phone number as I would be leaving as soon as the

Incident 25)_22"° September 2005

‘Auditors arrived at 08:20 and shut the PO down to carry out an audit. I was asked almost
immediately that they would ask me to settle the outstanding discrepancy to allow the PO
ito open again. I said I would not as the matter was in dispute and was being handled via
the NFSP. Unknown to me at that stage, Rachel Oysten (Area Intervention Manager- the
lone that I had made a formal complaint about) was waiting in the car outside. As soon as
ithe auditors finished RO came in and gave me two options: pay up or else she would have
fo suspend me and put some one else in charge at my expense. I made a call to Tony
Carpenter (Local NFSP Rep) and he advised me to pay as that was the most practical
course of action. I told RO that I did not have any money at that stage and the money
iwould simply have to be deducted from my salary. Subsequently, £3501-59 was deducted
from my October and November salaries. Needless to say RO relished every moment ~ at
lone stage even saying ‘well I am offering you this advice but last time I did that you made
a complaint about me’

At the meeting I asked RO that I wanted a meeting with Lesley Joyce. She said that she
iwould be filing a report and would arrange that.

The only letter I have had re: the above episode is from Lesley Joyce on 23 September
2005 which merely details deductions from remuneration.

The following day (25" May 06) { rang the helpline to inform them of my concerns re: cash
loss and the fact that I had settled via cheque. I sought advice to ensure the cheque and
its settlement via Horizon had been carried out correctly (my cheque would not appear
under the Daily cheque listing but I had to ensure that It was correctly accounted for when
it was despatched to the EDS centre. I was informed that I had done everything correctly.
At close of day, I was devastated to find that I was another £328.00 short. I and my
colleague recounted the cash, and coins and couid not find anything different. I reported
the loss to Kirsty on Helpline at 17:55. (Ref; H22099331). I was told that someone would
ring in the moming. Kath rang the following moming. Advised that I carry out a Balance
report in the evening. Mysteriously, at close of day on 26/05/06 ,the daily cash declaration
now indicated a shortage of £37! How is that possible? What is going on here?

07/06/06 ICarried out the normal end of day reports on Wednesday. The balance snapshot indicated
a cash loss of £55.68.Contiunued with the balance. The Balance report indicated a cash
loss of £74.00 and a massive gain of £668.90 on stamps. Shirley (my colleague) happened
to recall how in the moming she had remmed in cash and stock. However, she did

ie
POL00106935
POL00106935

remember being distracted by a customer could not say for certain that all of the stock had
been remmed in. All the advice notes from Hemel Hempstead and Horizon generated rem
in slips were checked. It appeared that Shirley had remmed in 7 of the 9 items .The 2
missing were £1000 of £1 stamps and 400 50p stamps. So, in total, it appeared that £1200
was not accounted for but the gain on stamps was only £668.90.All coin, notes and stock
was rechecked. No discrepancies were found. The £1200 worth of stock was remmed in
and the balance report now indicated a loss of £1290. I rang the Helpdesk and explained
the problems to Karen Conway (Ref: H22114370), She asked me to run a REM in report
and confirm exactly what had been remmed in. This was done. Karen could not help
further and said that she would refer the issue to someone else and they would ring in the
morning. I explained to Karen that I was not prepared have a loss of £1290.56 because
once in the system it would disappear in a black hole and { would never see it again. She
agreed and I finished the balancing process and moved into the next Balance Period with
ja net gain of £578.34.

‘The following morning (08/06/06), I received a call from Annette Caddick. I explained ail of
the above and also the background regarding other issues I had had with the Horizon
system. In summary, she confirmed that she was aware that other Sub-Postmasters were
having Horizon problems. She accepted my argument that if I remmed in the £1200.00
worth of stock I would be sitting on a loss as described above and it would be unlikely that
isum would be ever recovered. She advised me to sit on the gain and put the money to the
side. She also advised me to explain my problems to Alan Cook the CEO of POL. I
explained to her the recent sequence of events viz. the initial losses which I put down to
new starter learning mistakes which then escalated to £3500+.This sum I was forced to
pay to continue trading. Annette offered to arrange for an Area Intervention Manager to
help but when i recounted my experience with Rachel Oysten she was horrified and could
not believe that POL would have the stupidity of sending the same person to reprimand me
as the one who I had made a formal complaint about. I also mentioned the NFSP and
Gareth Hall, With losses now approaching £10,000, and nobody prepared to help, It was
with great reluctance that I had chosen to file a court action against POL. Annette was very
sympathetic but in the end it did not explain or resolve the stock rem in issue.

On 12/06/06, { noticed on several occasions that when I was carrying out a Recorded
Delivery transaction on Terminal 2, the Horizon system had not printed a certificate of
posting. Instead, it had It had flipped straight on to the stack and completed the
transaction. Initially, I thought perhaps it was a user error but on checking with Ivy
(Terminal 3) she had experienced exactly the same and like me thought perhaps she had
pressed the ‘Label Printed OK’.

I reported the issue to Horizon Helpdesk on Option 2 (Technical Issues) and spoke to
Imran.He said I should talk to Option 3 (User issues). I said to him that this was a technical
issue- not a user issue. He did not seem interested. I then rang Option 3 and spoke to
Barbara-she said it was a technical issue! Ref: H22118262.

Sara rang at 14:15 on 14/06/06 and said that Recorded Delivery transactions should no
longer generate a separate Certificate of Posting. On 29" June 2006 reported the problem
Again to Christine because the system continues to print CoP at random. It is not
consistent. Either it should be printing a CoP every time or none at all-not when it feels like
it. What else is it doing randomly? I have had no response from Christine.

Gateway Issues

On 13° June 2006 at about 16:30 a thin yellow line appeared at the bottom of both
screens: ‘On-line banking unavailable’. Shirley Owens rang the Helpline and was advised
to reboot. This proved to be successful. (Ref: E06061403)

On 14” June 2006 at 09:00, same message again. System rebooted and appeared to be
OK. At 11:30 the same message re-appeared. Tried to reboot the Gateway terminal but
ithe system kept asking ‘insert card’, The card had already been inserted. Rang Helpline.
They suggested to switch off the power off to the modem under the counter. This was
done. It appeared to work on the Helpline side but not at Bowburn. Eventually was able to
reboot without turning the power on at the modem.

Helpline admitted that the reason why On-line banking was not available was because the
Gateway at Bowburn kept switching it self on and off. They send an engineer within 4
hours.

POL00106935
POL00106935

The engineer arrived at 13:30 and immediately changed the Gateway terminal. It took
several hours and we lost several hours of business. The engineer admitted that there
were considerable problems with the system.

CoOp Customer Issue

(On the same day at 10:30, a CoOp customer requested to withdraw cash. After going
through the sequence, the customer was advised by the Pin-Pad to remove the card as
ithe transaction had been successful. The transaction successful message appeared on
the screen but did not appear on the stack i.e. did not authorise payment-it just
disappeared off the screen altogether. Tried to run a receipt. No receipt for the £100. The
receipt generated was that of the previous transaction at 10:23.

Transaction had to be repeated (with an embarrassing explanation to the
customer).lf we had acted as per messages on the screen we could have paid out
ithe £100 and be sitting on a loss of £100 at night.

21/06/06 IAfter end of day reports, the balance snapshot indicated a cash loss £760. Reported to ~4.44
Melanie. She suggested to continue and run the balance report. This was done and the
loss now stood at £284.41. Reported to Martin at 19:45. Said his colleague will ring within

off the system. Stock was adjusted and the loss was £4.41

19/07/06 IReceived an amazing letter from a M Surmon from ETS Cheque Team (Ref CHX TO ~£257.24

EDS). The letter is effectively asking me to fork out £1552.82. The background to this is
that we processed 4 cheques (total value £1552.82) on 06/04/06. These were then placed
in the EDS pouch and would have been physicaily collected (and signed for) by the

postman on 07/04/06 at mid-day. Now somewhere along the line this pouch and/or the

22
POL00106935
POL00106935

cheques have been lost after leaving my Post Office. I am expected to make up the loss!
I rang M Surmon and told him that my responsibility in terms of EDS/Girobank and indeed
any other pouches finished the minute they have been collected and signed for by the
Postman or the Cash Delivery Team. The responsibility then lies with the Post Office. He
then said that it was not POL but EDS. I said I was not interested- It was not me! By this
time I had retrieved the transaction history and told him that I would fax him the details. I
made it clear that I would not be settling this amount. I had to accept the Transaction
Correction to move on but I accepted the option to ‘settle centrally’. It will be interesting
see whether it allows me to rollover into the next Trading Period on 26/07/06. [All details
were faxed to M Surmon on 19/07/2006 at 16:29]

26/07/06

Cash loss of £374.32.Had to pay up in cash to continue trading. Have no idea where the
money has gone. There have been no Transaction Corrections in my favour.

In a separate development, A&L have changed the design and procedure for despatch of
Giro pouches. [Up till now they have been picked up by the Postman] The pouches now
have ‘First Class’ printed on them-suggesting that they are to be posted. To clarify I rang
Claire at helpline. She was puzzled as well. In view of the Transaction Correction above
lre:EDS pouche { made it clear to Claire that I had no intention of despatching these
pouches by post-if they must be sent by post then it would have to be Special Delivery and
POL will have to bear the cost. I could not possibly despatch thousands of pounds worth of
paying in slips and cheques via ordinary post. Ref: H22168601 was given and later
someone rang to confirm that I could send by post or via the current procedure i.e.
Postman signing for them.

On 3° of August I was informed by my local Councillor that Royal Bank of Scotland were
proposing to install a free cash machine in Bowbum. He wondered if that would be in my
Post Office. I said I had not heard anything and besides all the cash was dispensed free of
charge to the customer in the Post Office. He said that perhaps the machine could be
installed in the local library or the community centre. I said that it would be a further nail in
the coffin for the Post Office. I rang the Helpline to clarify and was told that my Contracts

Manager would ring me. Still waiting.

that this particular issue had nothing to do with me. If cheques have left my Post Office and
they have been lost between leaving the Post Office and EDS centre then it is not my

OnLine Banking Problems

07/09/06 At start of business today, On-line banking was not available. (Failure of On-line
banking means customers cannot withdraw cash, or check their balance using their PO
Card and customers from partner banks are similarly affected. In addition, we cannot sell
lor encash postal orders or top up or issue mobile vouchers and cannot sell Travel
Insurance. in short, vast majority of our business comes to a halt-also has a major impact
ion retail side of the business as customers withdraw cash to buy lottery, scratch cards,
cigarettes, confectionery etc.).

Contacted Helpline immediately (09:00) on Option 2 (Horizon Technical] and spoke to
Jimmy. RB was told to go through the usual procedure i.e. re-boot the system whilst
Horizon checked their side. This was done without success. Call Ref: E0609070162.
Jimmy did not call back but RB rang at 16:00 for an update and spoke to Rick on Option2.
Rick said they were still investigating. Rick said it could take a few days if it was a BT fault.
Also today at 13:30, RB spoke to Jane on Option 3 (NBSC Business Policy) re:
compensation for loss of business. Jane did not know but would relay my message to a
colleague. Call Ref: H14928067.

08/09/06 Rang Option 2 at 09:00 and spoke to Joe. Investigation ongoing - nothing to
report.

Rang Option 3 at 14:00 and spoke to Barbra re: compensation. She said ‘there was
something in place’ for these types of incidents but was not sure about the details. She did
Inot offer to find out or refer the call to someone who might be able to help.

it was becoming quite clear even at this early stage that POL was not really bothered if the
system goes down. It was left to me (after all it is my business, my livelihood and my staff
lwho still have to be paid even when we have no business) to do the chasing every few

25
POL00106935
POL00106935

hours for an update.

Spoke to Darren on Option2 at 15:10. He said that it was a BT fault and BT was
investigating.

09/09/06 Rang Option 2 at 09:00 and spoke to Trish. Nothing to report.

11/09/06 Sarah rang at 14:00 to discuss the issue. I expressed my anger, frustration and
concerns at the fact that by now (4 days into the problem) I had probably lost some of my
customers forever. Some customers I had to send to a local PO over 1.5 miles away-not
easy for customers who are 90 years old! Others went to Durham city fo the banks-
precisely what we do not want. My retail side had suffered considerably. Needless to say
Sarah was very sympathetic but unable to do anything as it was a technical matter!

12/09/06_No update from Option 2

13/09/06 Some local customers who clearly consider Bowburn PO as their PO and want it
ito remain in business contact their councillor, Mike Sayer. Mike contacts me and I give him
as much information as I can. He in turn contacts the local MP Roberta Blackman Woods.
The representative form RBW’s office tries to contact POL but POL will not talk to her.
Clearly POL could not be bothered to update me so I rang Option 2 at 15:20 and spoke to
a David. Davis reported that last update from BT was on 12/09/06 and it was apparently a
BT Broadband fault but could not say how long it would take to sort out.

At about 14:00 a Fujitsu engineer tured up at Bowburn PO. I asked him why was at
Bowburn. ‘To change the Gateway base station’ he said. I said that I had been told it was a
BT fault., I allowed him carry on. After spending about 30 minutes he confirmed that it was
not a local fault i.e. base units were OK. His ‘Consignment completion note’ noted that
‘Gateway Multiple... has been non polling for 5 days’. He commented that BT never admit
it is their fault.

Ken on Option 2. Now being told it is a ‘3% Line BT fault’. BT were still looking.

Rang Donna on Option 3 re: compensation. She said that ‘it kicks in after 48 hrs’

l rang NFSP at Shoerham office and spoke to Linda. She said she would contact someone
on the technical team at Horizon. Linda came back later to say that the man she spoke to
was surprised that on line banking had been down fer so long. She said that a GSM unit
will be instalied later that day (it was nearly 16:00 at the time) but more likely the following
day. [GSM modem is similar to a mobile phone and connects to the network when the
primary connection is down].

15/09/06 Rang Option 2 at 10:30 and spoke to Mark as there was no change and no sign
of a GSM unit. He could give any further information and said he would ask a supervisor to
ring. Sara the supervisor rang at 10:45. She could not give any information and could not
help further. Also spoke to Rob on Option 3 Ref: H22213312. No update.

I rang Linda at NFSP again and explained that nothing had happened and had now lost
another half a day. She came back and said an engineer would be with us by 12:00. The
engineer turned up about 13:30 and installed the GSM unit.

John rang at 17: 00 from NBSC and tried to help. I outlined the problems to him and
essentially left him with the following comments:

e The customers that I had lost-some probably forever.
« Howdol explain to customers who are in their late 80’s upwards and for many the PO

2?
POL00106935
POL00106935

card account is their only source of income?

e Why have I not been kept updated?

¢ If the problem lay with BT (POL admitted on the second day that it was a BT problem)
then why in this day and age does it take BT 8 days upwards to sort out?

*® IfM&S or Tesco’s tills had gone down and the fault lay with BT then the fault would
have been sorted out within a few hours.

* If On-line banking had failed in any of the Crown Offices, would it have taken 8 days ?

*® POL has consistently taken the SubPost Offices for granted. What they do not
understand or appreciate is that they (the SubPost Offices ) are the backbone of their
organisation.

« Why did it take the intervention of the NFSP to arrange a GSM to be installed in my
PO, Clearly this little gizmo was available-why was it not offered to me in the first place
for example within 24 hours?

« Other things went wrong as well. The Cash Management team at Leeds clearly do not
manage cash. Do they ever look at the Cash Declarations and adjust ? Clearly not.
Whilst on Line banking was down, they knew we had not been communicating did it
not occur to them to ring up and find out why? They continued to send cash with the
result that we were sitting with over £80,000 cash in our safe. At one stage I could not
physically get any more into the safe’s drawer! When I queried, Richard said it was up
to me to ring up and cancell

John was sympathetic but could not offer any help. One thing he did advise me to do was

to write to Adam Crozier CEO Royal Mail. I said but that is Royal Mail- we are talking

about POL.

i said to John, that the issues I was talking about were relatively simple but they smacked

of gross mismanagement at the middle levels of management. Clearly there are

employees within POL who are still stuck in the 1960's pre-privatisation era and who think
they just have to turn up for work without any responsibility or accountability. I am sure

Adam Crozier has far more serious things to worry about then a simple On Line banking

issue at Bowburn.

On 9" February 2007 2 message via the Horizon offered an explanation : ‘Due to a
problem with our database, the branch name in each address did not match with the
subpostmasters name, address and postcode’.

I consider this to be quite a serious issue. At this time there is considerable uncertainty
about closures of Post Offices. Can you imagine the fiasco if this letter had been any other
than a business statement!

if they cannot get the simple task of getting a letter from the MD of POL to the Sub
Postmasters right then what hope is there for the Horizon system getting the sums right!

Received an interesting ‘phone call from my brother who also manages a Post Office in
Birmingham. He had remmed out 2 bags of £1 coins (£1000). The first recipt issued by the
Horizon system was correct (2 X £1= £1000). This is the receipt given to the Collecting
Officer on Delivery/Collection day. The second receipt (Branch Copy- which we retain for
two years) stated ‘1 bag @ £500’. My brother immediately ‘phoned the Helpline and was
told that there had been a problem with the Horizon system and there had been several
repOrts that day. He was told to rem one more bag again out again. He told them how
could he do that The system already registered the fact that only one bag had been
rermmied out..

Tuesday 27/02/07Received our Planned Order for cash to be delivered on Wednesday.
Planned delivery is insufficient so have tried ringing Cash Management Team without any

foun

Most of the transactions carried out on the Horizon system are reversible. For example, if a
Icustomer purchases postage stamps, tops up a’prepayment card (BT, British Gas,
Northern Electric etc.) and then changes his mind then the transaction can be quickly and
easily reversed.

There are some transactions which:

a) Are not reversible e.g. Smartcards. These are usually British Gas prepayment type
cards, Once these are credited —they have to be paid for. If the customer does not have
the means to settle we would withhold the card.

b) Only allow a few minutes to reverse the transaction. Mobile top ups are such
transactions. Once a Mobile card is swiped and topped up or system generated
voucher issued, only few minutes are available to reverse the transaction.

This incident happened at 17:03. Shirley Owens (SO) immediately started to bin the
transaction. The system would not allow this. SO then started the process of trying to
reverse the transaction. While she continued, RSB rang the Helpline on Option 3 to seek

35
POL00106935
POL00106935

help in reversing this transaction. (RSB realised that although it was a software error ~the
priority at this stage was to reverse the transaction-hence the reason to contact Option 3
and not Option 2 (Technical issues).

SO’s efforts to reverse the transaction failed. The message on screen stated :
‘Refund Declined Card was for a different card/product’

From about 17:05 RSB and SO were continually on the ‘phone to Helpline until 18:00
seeking advice

RSB spoke to Sean on Option 3 (Ref: H16327843). We had already done what Sean
suggested so I was transferred to Option 2 to speak to Gary. it was 17:20 and by this time
lwe had lost the £10. It was too late to reverse the transaction. Gary's immediate reaction
was that it was a software issue. He then proceeded to talk to his manager who was.
overheard to tell Gary to tell us that it was not a software issue-which Gary repeated to us.
SO then spoke to a Suki ( she would not give her second name because ‘she was not
obliged to under her contract’) who was apparently Gary's superior. Suki absurdly
suggested that we had ‘incorrectly carried out the transaction’.SO explained to her exactly
what she had done but Suki was not prepared to listen.

[By this time the queue was forming in the PO and as we only had one functioning terminal
I grabbed the ‘phone from SO],

I put it to Suki that how was it remotely possible for us to carry out the transaction
incorrectly? Other than swipe the card we had not done anything-the system did not allow
lus to do any thing-it generated the voucher automatically. We did not touch the screen-we
did not even tap a key on the keyboard.

Suki then suggested that it was a previous transaction. I explained to her that as we had
ino faith in the systern, we always ran off a counter printer receipt even if we sold a stamp.
This we have done for the last two years. For the record the previous transaction was
icompleted at 16:58 and was postage labels a series of parcels-not remotely related to the

36
POL00106935
POL00106935

issue in question.

Suki then refused to accept that it was a technical issue and then transferred me to
Option3. It was now approaching 18:00. I then spoke to a Lisa who after listening to the
problem said that it was a technical issue! I said to Lisa that I knew that and she knew that.
lAt 18:00 I decided to terminate the call as clearly we were just going around in circle.

At 18:03 we had to settle the transaction on Terminal 3 to for the terminal for balance
purposes. This meant that someone now had £10 credited to their mobile at my expense.

** Mr Allinson (Tesco mobile incident described above) came on 19" Apri 2007. I wanted

to confirm that it was his card that was topped up again at 17:03. I made a ‘phone call from
his mobile to my mobile to log his number and sure enough it was his mobile:

Bowburn Post Office
Lottery Scratchvards Discrepandies
Ba un

Bowbum Post Office is among the s¢lected Post Offices which can carry out National Lottery
transactions on behalf of Camelot. It can also sélls National Lottery Scratchcards.

The incident below (under ‘Sequence of Events’) refers specifiéally to Scfatchcards.

Seratchcards (in £1, £2, and £5 ‘dendminations’) are delivered via a courier, Upon delivery, the
pack is opened and checked so that the contents agree with the barcoded delivery slip. The value of
each pack is £120. There are 120 cards on £1, 60 on £2 arld 24 on £5 packs, ;

The delivery slip is scanned into the Camelot Lottery Terminal (situated on the retail side of the
business). The packs of scratch cards are then stored in a secure area behihd the PO Counter,

‘When a pack of scratchcards is required for salé, it is scanned on the Camelot Terminal to ‘activate’
it, The number of cards activated is then remmed into on the Horizon System (PO side) If for
some reason, the pack is not activated or remméd into Hotizon System, then Shirley Owetis
(Counter Clerk-20+ years experience) ‘adjusts stock’ on Horizon systern on a regular (weekly) basis
so the number of cards currently active (on sale on the retail side) matches what is oh the Horizon
system. That is what we were ied to believe-as we adjust stock with bther PO items ¢.g, stamps
stamp books etc. we did not think adjustirig scratchoards this way would create problems. No
training has ever been given to us on the Lottery side.

42
POL00106935
POL00106935

As the Lottery Terminal is situated dn the retail side, all cash taken on the retail side is placed into a
common till on the retail side, At the close of business everyday, two reports are gerferatetl: one for
On-Line Lottery and one for Scratcheards.(see Appendix 1). A simple calbulation is cartied out to
separate the cash due to the PO'(.e. Camelot) dnd that duc to the retail side. The money owed to the
Post Office is transferred every day at close of business.

We have nevet knowingly had any problems with Lottery or Seratcheards and cannot recall
any Transaction Corrections in thé past.

Sequence df Events

On 20" August 2007, Shifley Owens (Counter Clerk) wad contacted by John Day from Lottery
‘Team stating that they had been looking at our Lottery records for the last two years and there were
disctepancies ih scratchcards aétivated vs. remmed in. He insisted that it was simply a ‘stock
adjustment’ thdt was required. :

S Owens informed RS Bifchu the followihg day and RSB immédiately rang John Day and stated
that for a start of it was unacceptable for POL to go back 2 yeats betause RSB had checked and
confirmed with BOTH Camelot and POL over two years ago that Lottery records need only be kept
for 6 months. Why row were they dragging in Transactioh Corrections for whith RSB would not be
able t dispute.

John Day insisted again that there was no money involved-that it was merely a “stock adjustment’.
RSB said ‘send me the paperwork and I’ll have'a look at it’.

On 28" Septemiber 2007, a 17 page report (mainly listing) arrived from John Day. RSB looked at
the final figure on the last page which stated 4317.

IRSB rang J Day immediately and quizzed him about this figure and whether this wa’ the amount in
pounds that RSB was expécted to pay. J Day replied again that no it was merely a stock correction
and at the most the cost would be a penny.

43
POL00106935
POL00106935

[Discussions continued ovér the next few days betwetn 5 Owens /RS Bilkhu and Johh Day to ensure
that we all understood clearly bow this discrepancy might have ariset.

it is possible, at times, scratchcard pack may have been ‘activaled’ but not ‘remmed in’. However,
whether a pack had been femmed in or not, the Post Office (and Canielot) received what was die to
them each every day as described above. Nobody has lost out.

And also as described above § Owens keeps a check to erisure the numbed of scratchivards' on
Horizon matchts what we have physically on sale. It is not often ‘stock adjustment is required
because S Owens is in three days pet week and keeps a check on stock.

Now, whether there was a stock discreparicy or not, the fact remains that the correct amount due to
Camelot/PO was trahsferred AND loggedon Horizon with details of the scratchcards sold and
prizes paid out etc. (Appendix 1 refers). This has to be the case because:

a) we cannot recall having any TR’s re: Lottery

1b) we should have had an increase of £120.00 on out Balance Snapshot every time a scrattheard
pack had gone astray. We have not. In fact, as Appendix 2 (this is surnmary of the 17 page repott
that J Day sent but only picks up the dates in question) ilfustratés, on the dates in question Bowburn
PO balance Snapshot figure is 4 negative in all but four cdses.

‘Transaction i

John Day finallly sent the TR oft 11" October 2007.RSB did not accept it until the 12" October due I

to uncertainty in what effect it might have on the balance. By abcepting the TR, it indrease the
number of scratchcards held by the Horizon system (515) to 4832!

44
POL00106935
POL00106935

IRSB was horrified by this and this is exactly what RSB had been trying to explain to J Day. This
now mearit thal on Balance Day, stock would be adjusted and the by adjusting the scratchcards to
ithe physical level ic. about 500, the system would be looking for £43171 That is what RSB would
be expected to put in to rollover to next Trading Period! This was all explained to J Day but he
continued to insist that it was just a stock transaction. John Day said that the only way to address
this was to ‘reverse’ the original adjust Stock increases.

Helpline Discussions

IRSB rang the Helpline on 16" October 2007 at 12:40 (Balance Day-Branch Trading Period) to seek
help and advice to address what was now clearly a serious problem-if RSB corrected ‘the Horizon
held stock of scratchcards-Bowburn PO would close the following day.

‘At 12:40 RSB Spoke to a Sandra on Option}. She said that as it was a ‘credit’ TR 1 should simply
take £4317 out and keep it! I said to Sandra that it was not as simple as that. She said she would get
someone to ring later.

RSB rang later and spoke to a Neil, Neil explained that as it was a credit it would increase the stock
value and I wolild be expected to pay £4317.

Maureen from Helpline rang later and initially agreed with what Sandra had said Le, ‘take out cash-
it’s yours’ but when I explained the implications of the Balance Report, she agreed that I would
have to pay.

IMy final discussion (also with S Owens participating) took place with Paul Smith ( John Day’s Line
Manager. This discussion went on for a good hour and all of the above points were explained to
Paul viz. trobody has benefited from this, all parties concerned have had the cash where due as all
scratcards sold are accounted for at the end of the day and cash transferred. If there had been a
surplus, it would have been highlighted by an increase in cash on our Balance Snapshot.

45
POL00106935
POL00106935

I suggested to him that all accounting systems had to have a debit/credit. All they had given me was
the debits. To address this correctly, what the Lottery team needed to do was to obtain the bales
figures and match them with the cash declared and transferred by Bowburn PO.

‘Paul said that they were unable to get those figures! RSB was astounded by this statement.

In the end Paul did say that he would investigate further but iti the meantime it was agreéd that the
figure on Horizon would temaih unchanged so that it would allow RSB to rollover to thé next

She confirmed that they had ativised RSB that records heed aly be kept for 6 months as
tlains by customers were not entertained after that period, made the same query to
POL at Chesterfield on that day (10 March 2005) and they said if Camelot were happy
so were they.

08/12/07 (8° Gecember 2007 around mid-day. Received a ‘phone call from Rachel Oysten (BDM)

requesting if she could come in and look at Branch Trading statements. R Bilkhu agreed
and she arrived at 14:00. RB gave her access to all Branch Trading statements. She said
that due {o the legal action, she had been asked by Lesley Joyoe If she could remove the

Statements, RB refused. RB said that whilst he realised they were the property of POL, the

47
POL00106935
POL00106935

act that there was now lagal action, those statements were effectively his ‘@vidence should
it be needed by hig legal team and besides POL already had the statements Via Horizon.

Rachel also queried (on behalf of Lesley Joyce) whether the outstanding Transaction
Correction for Lottery issue had been settied. RB said NO for the simple reason that we
havé a dispute over the TR and besides I do not have £4312 to settle. Rachel said that it
would simply be taken out of my remuneration,

On the issue of Branch Trading statements, it was agreed that she would return on
Tuesday 11/12/2007 and accompanied by RIB would photocopy the statements.

On 11/42/07 RO returned, took the BTS’s to the Crown Office for copying. I was left with
the copies. She kept the originals. On return she said there were a few which were missing
(4 . I said they were probably filed in the weekly reports and I will dig them out in the next
few days,

POL seem to have chosen a particularly bad time to ask for these statements-the busiest
period imaginable when they have had the whole of last year.

Re nse to Andy Wi ; Lot Si
The following letter was sent to Andy Winn on 6” December 2007.

Dear Mr Winn,

icratcheards Issues

‘Thank you for your letter dated 15 November 2007 re: above. My apologies for the delay but I
have been awalting a response from NFSP.

In the absence of a response from NFSP to date and in view of the impending legal action, 1 now
igive the following response to you letter.

appreciate the time you have taken to investigate and report my concerns but the key questidn still
remains ubanswered,

48
POL00106935
POL00106935

‘It seems’to me that POL, the Lottery Team and others are getting themselves tied in knofs over
Horizon technical jargon and accounting terminology.

The issué is very simple}

Scratcheatds are received at Bowburn Post Office and as and when required put into dispensers for
sale,

‘This activity is no different to goods being received into a Tesco warehouse and then put onto
shelves in the‘retail area for sale.

Up until'the point 4 customer purchases and pays for the goods, no sale is made and ne income is
getierated, .

I have already explained in my previous correspondence how, at close of business, a simple
calbulation separates the cash due to POL (Camelot) and what remains for the retail side,

(Our retuil sidle is relatively small-daily takings average £63-00. We know front experience thet aver
80% of the cash accumulated in our retail till belongs to POL(Camelot) for the lottery. If we find the
takings are uhusually high e.g. £150-00, we know q mistake has been made in our calculation. This
may be simply due to an error in reading the seratchoard number (numbers arg upside down on the
tf side)! Even if the mistake is carried over, it will correct itself the following day when the number
is re-read and as already explained, Shirley Qwens (Counter Clerk) keeps a meticulous check an the,
catds at least 2-3 times per week ahd compares to what we have and what the Balance Snapshat
states. Any dixcrepancy is made good in cash).

al

Camelot’s management systems and their ability to access information are excellent.

IAt any given time, Camelot id fully aware of :

* The number of packs of sotatchcards we have in our secure atea

© The number of activated packs and the names of the games ih dispensets on sale

© ‘The pumber of lottery (Lotto, Thunderball, Buromillfons dtc.) tickets we have sold

le The pumber of prizes on-line and sctatchcards we have paid out

The information that Camelot lacks during the day is the actual number of soratchoprds that we have

sold, As‘alrearly explained, we calculate the number of seratchcards sold using a simple spreadsheet

@
POL00106935
POL00106935

(Appendix Ya and 1b). This is the ikfomntation we give to POL via the Horizon systém at the close of
each day between 17:30 and 17:45,It is usually the last transaction carried out on Horizoh, Due to
early closing, Saturday's {information is input on Monday motning before opéning anid is usually the
first transaction carried out of Monday.

These transactions are no different to any other transactions we carry oul on Horizon-be it the salé
ofa stamp, bill payment, Giro's, cash withdrawals, cash deposits ete. it is exsentially cash in-
cash out.

Tt does not matter, therefore, how many packs were feceived, remmed in, remined oat,
activated or not activated-the key question which you, Paal Sniith, Johh Day and others in the
Lottery Team refuse to answer is the number of seratchcards sold. J find it diffiewlt to adeept
John Day/Paul Smith’s answer that sales figures are not available,

IA very simple way to address this issue is for POL, to obtain the sales figures from the dites it
question, equate them to the number £1, £2, and £5 s¢ratch cards sold and theb compared with
the figures supplied by Camielot. A competent person should bé able to do this exercise in a less
than two hours. All information should be available at the press of a button.

I now make comments on ottiet parts of your letter:

Paregrabh 9

The fact that the Lottery Teatn had a backlog is Kankly of little interest to the, All it tells me is the
levels of mismanagement and incompetence within the organisation. If the system was not reddy
why on earth did POL move over to Branch Trading?

Making mistakes regularly seems to be part and parcel of POL’s'culture, You only have to look at
the Methos sent to SubPostmasters via the Horizon system. Practically every other remo isan
adnission of incorrect informiation supplied or incorrect instruction.

Paragraph 10 . . ,
There was absolutely no confusion on our (Myself and Shirley Owens) part. All cohversitions took
place with both of us present. The details of the conversation are already documented in previous

correspondence and demonstrate quite clearly the contradicting advice given by Lottery Team and

The £120 surplus should have appeared in the Balance Snapshot. The losses indicated are due tb
faults with thé Horizon system for which the legal action is being putsued, If you ate suggesting that!
the losses on the weeks in question does'not indicate the expected surplas is not insorporated within
the net logs figure, then the issues with Horizon are thuch mote serious than previously thought,
Paragragh 12° .

On the basis that I folldwed preceduré and instructions from POL and Cainelot and disposed
of Lottery records after 6 months the current claim (if at all valid in the first place) is null and
void and Iam not prepared to consider the claim any further,

Lam prepared to consider albeit very reluctantly (because it will mean going through Horizon
slips for every single day for the lavt six months) siny claint for the last six months a9 {will havd
the records and that only om the basis that you supply ine with the actual breakdown of every
single sdratchcard sold (which we would have deciardd on Horizon and the number of
iscratchéards supplied by Camelot,

The Transaction Correction was not cortect to have been issued, Not énough thought or
understanding went into prior to the note being issued. Time and time again we were told there was
no money involved-it was merely a stack vorrection.

IAll monjes due to POL (Camelot) have been paid. There is no money whatsoever due4o POL in this
instance,

Tf there is a need for stock adjustment xhent that is between POL and Camelot NOT between POL
and Bowburn PO.

A further iransaction correction now needs to be issued to reverse out the 4312 to take us back to
what we physivally hold in dhe braach.
