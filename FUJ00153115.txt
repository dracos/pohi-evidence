Penny,
I had a call from Charles McLaghlan (defence expert) this afternoon.

According to Charles, the judge in the last hearing has asked for the experts to get together and agree what they agree
and what they don’t agree.

He outlined a number of further investigations he would like us to carry out together and would like to arrange an initial
half day meeting to progress this.

I said that I would need to get advice from both Fujitsu and POL as to where this fitted into my priorities.

Hence this email. Not sure whether this is something we want to sort out in Fujitsu first (hence copying Tom) or just pass
it straight on to POL.

The good news is that he is looking for problems in people’s use of Horizon and not bugs in Horizon as such. He has
other cases that he is looking at and trying to get a consolidated analysis.

I may pop up for a chat in the morning.
Regards

Gareth
