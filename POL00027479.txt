The committee was asked to endorse the risk management approach and methodology and to provide
feedback on the content and structure of future risk reporting

jiscussi

The overview of ExCo risks paper was discussed and the committee reviewed each risk considering whether :

- the ExCo view was an accurate reflection of the risk
- the governance structure was appropriate for the risks
- had there been enough progress in managing the risk

An overview of the risk management approach and progress to date was provided and the committee requested
an interim update on progress every 4 weeks outside of the normal committee meeting schedule. The committee
provided feedback on the structure and content of risk reporting and it was agreed that the name of the business
partner and the risk owner be identified in future updates. The committee also requested that consideration be
given to the use of a RAG status to more clearly identify the quantum of risk.

As a general point the committee asked that consideration be given to more clearly describing the top risks in
the interests of clarity — this will be reflected in subsequent reports to the committee.

i
I The top risks were discussed by exception and the following comments made, however no significant concerns
I were raised:

Integrity of Horizon System

It was agreed that, whilst this is more of an issue than a risk, the progress on managing Sparrow would continue
to be reported to the committee. It was noted that assurance work was being planned on Sparrow, especially
with regard to its dependency on the Business Improvement Programme.

Inadequate People Capability

The committee was concerned that the risk was too focused on the capability of those currently employed rather
than the mix of people and skills we need to deliver the strategic plan and a sustainable business. It was agreed
that this will be followed up with the risk owner.

Data Security / Cyber Security

It was confirmed that merging the two risks had been agreed with Lesley Sewell (Chief Information Officer) and
Julie George (Head of Information Security). The committee expressed concern regarding the IT capability in the
R&C team and it was confirmed that a new IT Business Partner with experience in this field was due to start in

To conduct a “deep dive” session on the management of the FS mis-selling risk

The committee received a presentation on the FS Mis-selling risk. The committee suggested that the appropriate
Risk & Compliance business partner should attend future deep dive sessions to support the risk owner.

The committee asked for more detail regarding the training and development controls and the risk owner
explained that 100 mortgage specialists would be in place by April 2014 together with training & development
logs retained in a central admin team in London.

The committee requested details of the ‘go-live’ decision for Mortgage Market Review. The risk owner explained
this was performed through the Mortgage Market Review Governance Board which would be confirmed. The risk
owner also confirmed that the Financial Services Sub Committee was under review and that terms of reference
would be provided in due course

The Key Risk Indicator (KRI) measures were reviewed and the committee asked for more detail on how the
tolerances had been calculated. The risk owner provided an explanation of how the tolerances had been
identified and agreed

owners and in any reporting to the committee
