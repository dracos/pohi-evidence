Gareth

By implication a being on the RER suggests that it is not a PinICL but a design change to Escher code - so suggest you do indeed
close the PinICL with a text that indicates it is on RER and that Escher code is working as they designed it!

Mark,

Please can you have a look through the 7 PinICLs in the list assigned to you. | suspect that many of them can either be closed
or "Parked". | can supply you with more details about them if you have problems in getting through to PinICL.

Brian / Chris: The one assigned to me has now been moved to Parked. It is on the RER as a "nice to have". | could close it if
that is thought more appropriate.

Regards

Gareth

Gents,
It will take a little time for the new "users" to bed in. I
am not actively working on anything in "Ctr-Inbox" or

"Parked". If you have a pet Pinicl therein that you think I

should be chasing then come over and beat me up.

Likewise feedback to Chris on Pinicls that are At-Escher but
not Reproduced.

Could Lionel sort the priorities of the two "A"s please.
