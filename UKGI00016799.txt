5. UKGI Board review — follow up

The Board agreed the new agenda format and reporting template should be implemented from
the May meeting. It was noted that the precise definition of ‘material’ new mandates would
require a degree of judgment, particularly in relation to MOD, where the role of joint unit is
evolving rapidly, and that where it is unclear, the relevant director should liaise with the Chair
and CEO. It was also noted that there would be a clear need to maintain lines of
communication from the Transaction Committee to the main Board.

6. Portfolio Governance Update

The Board noted the update, and enquired what purpose the report serves — it was confirmed
that this summary will form part of the portfolio performance review, and will help to demonstrate
the ongoing progress made in UKGI's governance roles. The Board asked that examples of
good chair's letters be shared.

Action: Two examples of good chair’s letters to be shared with the board.

7. Portfolio Performance Management

The Board agreed the proposals for portfolio performance and risk management. The
centralisation of both aspects under the remit of the COO was noted, and the feedback into
learning, development, resourcing and recruitment discussed. It was noted that each portfolio

performance review would be attended by the COO, two directors, and two EDs, which should
help to ensure a suitable level of rigour. It was agreed that it may also be appropriate to invite
the relevant NED to these reviews. It was also agreed that a clear line into the ARC from the
RACs was required.
