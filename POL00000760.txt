PM says that when the engineer came round on Thu 29/06/00, he swapped the

ase unit and had to call in the engineer who came round on the Tue so
stopped w: time she got back onto the counter and did 48 PéA
kiockets (34 ted - she was definite that she did not enter
them twice) and Cheques to Data Central (which is missing). Then the engineer
jot back onto the counter and finished his work. Have asked the PM to give me

fhe RODC of £311.75 cheques (1-44474) is missing from message store. The PéA
cutoff (which the PM says she did) on 29/06/00 did not work which is why 34
f£ the 48 P&A transactions appear again in the P&éA report on 05/07/00. The
other 14 P&A transactions are missing from message store. The missing
transactions seems to have originated because the engineer swapped the base
linit and reused the corrupt mirror disk (see E-0006270199 and E-0006290568) .
Ittached is a spreadsheet showing all the APS and EPOSS transactions that
lexist message store. This will need to be reconciled with the PM to
reconstruct ALL missing transactions - routing call to MSU to
IBSC/PM.
