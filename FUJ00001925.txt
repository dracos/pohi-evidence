42

Fujitsu Services shall be entitled to close down, so they are not available for use, the
communication links between a single Data Centre and the NBX (but not between
both Data Centres and the NBX, save as provided in the remainder of this paragraph
4) for the purposes of maintenance, support, upgrade, repair or replacement of any
equipment used to provide or support those links. Fujitsu Services shall not carry out
scheduled maintenance during the NB Core Hours in respect of any components of
the Data Centres which provide on-line service.

Fujitsu Services shall be entitled (such entitlement being without prejudice to any
rights or remedies of Post Office in respect of a Default by Fujitsu Services) to close
down the link or restrict or prevent communications (in respect of all or certain types
of data) between Data Centres and the NBX if (and only if) Fujitsu Services

reasonably believes that:

(a) unless such action is taken there is a material risk that the security of the

Services or the Horizon Service Infrastructure will be materially compromised;

(b) data originating from the NBX would, if such action is not taken, cause the
Services or the Horizon Service Infrastructure to be materially impaired or

degraded;

(c) data originating from the Horizon Service Infrastructure would, if such action
is not taken, cause the NBX or End to End Banking to be materially impaired

or degraded; or

(d) as a result of an actual or suspected serious failure within End to End Banking,
there is a material risk that Banking Transactions might be incorrectly

Authorised or otherwise carried out in error. [NBR588]

43 Within one working day of Fujitsu Services closing down the interface between the
Data Centres and the NBX in accordance with paragraph 4.2 above, Fujitsu Services

further actions are required by Fujitsu Services, Post Office, Banks and Post
Office’s third-party suppliers to reinstate the interface and proposals to prevent

recurrence of the need to close the interface.

44 Post Office and Fujitsu Services shall agree:

(a) the detailed criteria and procedures (including those in respect of the

circumstances set out in paragraphs 4.2 and 4.3 above); and

(b) the procedures for closure of links described in paragraph 4.1 above,
