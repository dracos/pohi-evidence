Jessica

As discussed, please find attached the draft Letter of Response to Freeths that includes Counsel's approach to the
implied terms in the postmaster relationship. Section 4 is where we address contractual issues, in particular
paragraphs 4.34 and 4.35.

Other parts of the letter that you might find interesting are:

e Intro / executive summary
e — Section 4A: on the background to the postmaster relationship
* — Schedule 5: Contract models and variations.
Any comments on these paragraphs (or on any other part of the letter) are welcomed.

Kind regards
Andy
