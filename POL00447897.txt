NBIT Programme I Postmaster engagement

1. Document Purpose

This document has been created by the Postmaster Engagement Team, within the New Branch IT
(NBIT) Programme.

This document aims to introduce the reader to the Postmaster community and set out NBIT
engagement delivered to date with this audience This document is intended to be a “live” record of
Postmaster engagement and will be updated monthly to reflect recent activity.

2. Introduction to Postmaster community

Our Postmaster community is made up of c9500 independent business owners who operate a
majority number of Post Office branches across the UK, delivering c74% of Post Office overall
income. Postmaster branches operate on a franchise partnership basis and remuneration paid is
(usually) directly related to the daily transactions carried out in branch, according to transaction and
branch model type.

Postmaster branches are made up of 3 model types:
Mains: Our largest branches, where Post Office remuneration is expected to be the main source
of income for the operator, with the retail offer (in most cases) supplementing this. Mains
branches usually offer a full range of Post Office products and services, including transactions
that can take a significant amount of time to complete. As a result, operators are paid a rate of
remuneration that reflects the additional staff (and other) costs related to operating this branch
model type.
Local/Local+: The majority of Postmaster branches operate under this model type. The
operator's retail business is usually the main source of income, and they operate a 1 or 2 position
Post Office along-side their retail point of sale. In a Local model branch, this Post Office and
retail may be manned by just 1 person at a time. The Post Office supplements the primary
business through driving increased footfall and an extra source of income. There is a reduced
product offer in these branches with shorter, simpler transactions such as Mails and Banking
making up many daily transactions. Some branches also provide limited on-demand travel
services such as Euro & Dollar sales. Remuneration rates reflect lower operating costs.
Traditional: There is a mix of traditional model branches that operate under legacy contract
types. These vary in nature across the Network, with many branches in receipt of fixed payments
of different types. These branches may offer some of the services offered by a Mains model
branch, although they are likely to fall under the Local Model category if the contract were to
change. Some of these are hard to place (there is no alternative retailer in the area). Others are
branches that are required to meet Post Office access requirements and many operate outreach
services in rural locations across the UK*.

*All model types may offer additional outreach or mobile Post Office services to some of the most
rural and hard to reach locations across the UK.

NBIT Programme I Postmaster engagement

2.1 Communication & ways of working with Postmaster’s

Head Office — Postmasters receive a weekly email from Martin Roberts — Group Chief Retail Officer,
updating them on key business priorities relating to our business. The email contains links to other
sources of information and includes recognition for Postmasters in the community and across the
Network. This email also includes acommercial business update showing Week on Week and Year
on Year trends, particularly in core products such as Mails, Banking and Travel. All Postmasters
have access to Branch Hub, an on-line platform where they, and their teams, can access information
and operational updates relating directly to their branch.

Branch Level -— Each Postmaster has a dedicated Area Manger or (in the case of new Postmasters)
Business Support Manager to provide supportand guidance to them in all aspects of operating their
Post Office business. This can include, but is not restricted to, support to achieve contractual
obligations, maximise sales & remuneration or make savings on operational costs. There are 12
Regions across the UK, each headed up by a Regional Manager. Most Area Managers have c100
branches, although some have significantly more or less than this. Business Support Managers
support 10 — 15 Postmasters through the first 6 months of their Post Office journey, before being
handed over to the Area Manager for on-ongoing support.

2.2 Post Office operating system “Horizon”

The current IT operating system “Horizon” is the system used in all Postmaster Branches, and is
accessed using an individual Smart ID. All branch staff are vetted prior to being issued with a Smart
ID and these must not be shared between team members. However, there is nothing currently in
place to prevent this from happening. NBIT will introduce MFA (Multi Factor Authentication) to daily
log in and therefore should provide a higher level of protection to individualoperators of the system.

3. Retail Team

The Retail team within POL (Post Office Limited) holds and manages the overall relationship with
Postmasters. There are 2 main strands* to this team, both of whom have direct and/or face to face
engagement with Postmasters. At the time of writing a 3% strand is being set up, Retail
Transformation Programme (RTP) who will engage directly with Postmasters in the training and
deployment of NBIT.

4. NBIT engagement with Postmasters

NBIT engagement with Postmasters began in early 2021 with Nick Beal and Sarah Gallagher.
Naomi Yonas joined the team as Comms and Engagement Associate in May 2021. Sally Wilson
joined the team on 1% June 2022 as Postmaster Strategy and Engagement Lead. The team has
grown since then and there has been a significant amount of engagement with Postmasters, who's
feedback, ideas and critique have helped inform the design, build testing, training, and deployment
strategy for NBIT. Due to the recent formation of the Retail Transformation Programme’,
engagement is currently (June 2023) limited to the technical elements of NBIT — design, build &
testing including the deployment of release 2 piloting to Postmaster branches. However, our team
aim is to engage face to face with Postmasters to demonstrate the system from Release 2.

*RTP is currently (Sept 2023) being formally dissolved and incorporated back into SPM Programme

4.1 Postmaster IT working group

The Postmaster IT Working Group was started by Sarah Gallagher in collaboration with the Horizon
Improvements Postmaster Experience Team. Naomi Yonas has managed the NBIT element of the
working group sessions since June 2021 and Sally Wilson has led on the working group strategy
since joining the team on 1% June 2022. NBIT sessions are held independently of the Horizon
Improvements team sessions, although some Postmasters take part in both.
POL00447897
POL00447897

NBIT Programme I Postmaster engagement

The working group consists of 304 Postmasters and small number of Officers in Charge (OIC). 55%
of Postmasters in the working group have attended asession and 45 attend on a regular basis (more
than 5 times).

The purpose of the working group engagement from the NBIT Programme perspective is to ensure
that Postmasters can inform the design and build decisions from the earliest stages in its
development covering a wide range of operational, technical, and training practices.

From the Postmaster perspective this enables them to feel that they have been empowered to be
involved in the Programme and that their views and opinions have been sougft, listened to, and
considered during the various stages of design, build and testing of the new system.

The engagement sessions are hosted by subject matter experts within the NBIT Programme team
and facilitated by 2 representatives from the Postmaster Engagement team. Attendance at the
working group sessions is entirely voluntary for Postmasters and no remuneration is paid for their
time contribution.

*Sessions paused due to organisational restructure & Pogramme changes (Aug '23). Sessions re-
start Nov ‘23/Jan ‘24

4.3 Training & Information working group

Within the Postmaster IT working group, there is a dedicated group of 22 Postmasters who attend
dedicated Training & Information (T&l) working group sessions, which normally take place monthly*.
These sessions are intended to be progressive, building an overall understanding of the training &
information offer, seeking input to the design and build. In addition, the group are involved in
validation of current thinking and ideas around Training and Information and, at times volunteer for
test and pilot.

In June 2023, we sought to grow the size of the current T&l working group to ensure that freshpoints
of view were considered and plan to continue this to add a total of around 10 new members to this
group (from the main Postmaster IT working group). We also issued a calendar of forthcoming
session topics*.

*Sessions paused from August 2023 due to organisational restructure and Programme changes.

4.5 Working group 121 engagement sessions

Occasionally, as new team members join the Postmaster Engagement Team, ad hoc 121
engagement sessions are held with Postmasters from the working group. These are
welcome/introductory discussion sessions which are not recorded. However, a brief record of the
discussion is noted along with documentation of any questions that have been asked. Suggestions
and feedback that pertains specifically to the working group sessions is noted. These suggestions
are considered for change and/or improvement if deemed both advantageous to the group and
feasible to implement.

5 NFSP Engagement

Monthly meetings are held with the NFSP Network Engagement Team (NET) facilitated by the BAU
(Business as Usual) Postmaster Engagement Team. There is normally a 1-hour slot scheduled at
this meeting for NBIT updates. These updates are given by ether Nick Beal and/or Sally Wilson,
with ad-hoc support from other Programme workstreams i.e., a representative of the training team.
These meetings are documented by BAU Postmaster Engagement Team. In addition, NFSP
members are invited to the regular working group sessions if they have volunteered to be members
of the Postmaster IT working group.

On 31st January 2023, a dedicated update for the NFSP NET team was held in Finsbury Dials in
collaboration with the BAU Postmaster Engagement Team. This session was also attended by the
Postmaster Director, Hithendra Cheetirala. The session was scheduled for 9:45 am to 3:15pm and
included presentations from a range of NBIT Programme Workstreams. It also included a short
demonstration of NBIT and allowed NFSP board members to view all the hadware and devices.
Meeting notes were documented by the BAU Postmaster Engagement Team.

6 Foolproof Design Principles Focus Group

By September 2021 a prototype for the new counter system had already started being built, but
keen to ensure that any ongoing development was done with the end user at the heart, Foolproof
were brought in to run a rapid discovery phase with several goals:

e To ascertain the breadth of the 'pain points' and 'moments of truth’ faced by
postmasters/clerks within the existing Horizon Solution

e Plot these across the Service to understand how and when these occur, hypothesising over
how they can be improved

« Create a set of design principles (based on the research findings) for the NBIT programme
to follow for all ongoing development

« Create mock-ups of the design principles in action for a selection of journeys, showing how
they could improve the experience

e Lastly, create a visua

7 User Experience (UX) Testing

In January 2023, the Postmaster Engagement Team began facilitating User Experience (UX) testing
in collaboration with the UX design team led by Nikki Saveker. The team work closely with Jack
Riley who plans, conducts, and synthesises each study to help inform design decisions. Initial
feedback was sought from 2 Postmasters in the Nottingham Area, by Joanna Gaine These were
postmasters that she knew well, having worked directly for them in the past and they provided initial
feedback which helped us to formulate the appropriate style, layout, language that should be used
as well as identifying an appropriate length for both types of survey.

*Update: UX testing with Postmasters ended on 31% August 2023 due to Programme budget
constraints.

UX testing scheduled to re-start July 2024 (tbc) in line with mobile demo pilot 2

7.1. Unmoderated useability testing

We launch a study every 3 weeks with the aim of quickly testing NBIT designs with users. We use
our network of NBIT Champions and the Optimal Workshop testing platform to deploy the
unmoderated useability tests at pace. The results of these tests are anonymous, and results are fed
back to the US design team directly via the testing platform. The results are then synthesised by
Jack and a report produced.

These tests help us to understand Postmaster wants, needs and expectations in relation to NBIT
designs.

In August 2023, we increased activity to include Information Architecture tree testing. Information
architecture (IA) defines how information is organised and structured throughout the system Good
IA aims to ensure that users are easily able to find what they're looking for without getting lost as
they navigate around the system. The first tree test (sprint 9) allowed us to identify that further work
was needed and we decided to carry out further testing (sprint 10 a & b) to clarify some of the
results*.

We conduct in-depth interviews every 6 weeks with Postmasters from the IT working group (initially).
Postmasters are contacted by the Postmaster Engagement Team in advance to book a session slot
and the sessions take place via Microsoft Teams. Each session lasts around 45 minutes and is
facilitated and recorded by a member of the Postmaster Engagement team The interview
questioning is conducted by Jack Reilly. Postmaster responses allow Jack to gather in-depth
qualitative feedback in a moderated and contextual environment. The optinum number of interviews
per sprint is usually around 8. The results are synthesised before a report is produced documenting
and prioritising the results and design decisions made pertaining to that sprint.

These tests help us to understand Postmaster behaviour and preferences to inform strategic

decision making.

In June 2023, the Postmaster Engagement team conducted 121 sessions with 20 Postmasters to
give feedback on the preferred top line categorisation of the NBIT Homepage. During these
sessions we asked Postmasters which categories they would like to see on the Homepage, and
which products should be accessible via a quick link from the Homepage. We wanted to see if
there were clearly identifiable preferences or differences of opinion amongst the Postmaster
community.

8 NBIT Pilot branch engagement

NBIT will be piloted in 4/5 phases and is anticipated to include 50 branches of which 30 will be
Postmaster operated. Pilot release 1, was launched in 2 to Directly Managed Branches in
September/October 2022. Release 2 is scheduled to begin later in 2023. Release 2 will include a
phased release of 2.0, followed by 2.1 and 2.2, all expected to be implemented to DMB branches
only during Nov/Dec 2023 and early 2024.

As of 18 March 2024 — there are now 5 DMB branches proposed to pilot R2.1 and a record of all
comms has been added to the logs below.

8.1 Postmaster pilot branch engagement

At the beginning of 2023, we began the process of compiling a shortlist of branches which may be
suitable for piloting NBIT before contacting the Retail team and Postmasters. Postmasters were
given an overview of the pilot and offered the opportunity to find out more about taking part.
Interested Postmasters were then invited to attend a Microsoft Teams meeting, where find out
more, ask questions and listen to the views /questions of other interested Postmasters.

Following this, and once Postmasters confirm that they would like to proceed to the next stage, the
deployment team arrange a suitable date and time to visit the branch/Postmaster and carry out a
Feasibility Assessment. Where possible, a member of the Postmaster Engagement team attends
to help answer any operational questions that may be asked.

Following the assessment Postmasters are advised of the outcome and contact is maintained by
the Postmaster Engagement team until the beginning of the deployment lifecycle, in preparation
for pilot “go live.”

Logs of selection criteria and all communications can be accessed via these links which will be
kept updated until transfer to the deployment team.

9 Learning Management System (LMS) Pilot

The Postmaster Engagement Team are facilitating a pilot of the LMS system that will support the
training of Postmasters when their branch either pilots or converts to NBIT. Working in
collaboration with Postmasters and the NBIT training team, we began the pilot process in early
July 2023.

10 Mobile Demo Activity

In April 2024 we launched a mobile pilot of NBIT demo activity to Postmasters utilising a mobile Post Office
van kitted out with an early version of the NBIT system. The purpose of the demo activity is to allow
Postmasters to see, feel, touch and use the NBIT system in order to familiarise and provide feedback. The
pilot has been supported by communications to internal colleagues and to Postmasters. Following the first
pilot, we evaluated the approach and the effectiveness, taking feedback into account and agreed the
approach to phase 2 pilot prior to a full roll out, in collaboration with Retail Leadership.

Pilot 2 is currently in planning and scheduled to begin 8" July 2024.

October to May 2024 - informal monthly meetings have taken place with Abigail McGeever,
Strategic Partner Director. No decisions have been taken to date re the re-starting of Strategic
Partner engagement at either Head Office or Branch level.

13 Ongoing Postmaster engagement

The Postmaster Engagement Team will update this document minimum monthly from July 2023.

During August/September 2023 there is a degree of uncertainty around the future organisational
structure of the SPM Programme and all Postmaster Engagement is either paused or stopped until
Engagement team and Programme leadership strategy becomes clearer.
