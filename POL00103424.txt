Mark

In line with Carla’s comments I would take out paras 2 ( single sentence ) and paras 3 and 4
lalso strongly believe the statement should come from either Tim or Paula

I understand the tone but I believe any statement should be as brief and concise as possible

Best regards

Ken

Thanks for this

My comments are that we currently have a sentence that reads (and appears unfinished)
“We will not simply put a defence, we will face up to the criticisms and take action,

But we then do go on later to suggest that we might appeal and in setting out how things are better
now, we could be seen as being defensive. So I would suggest dropping the first part of this sentence.

You also refer to the fact that most of this happened before we became a commercial enterprise - Iam
not sure that this is relevant to the rest of the statement or additive

I think there are a few typos eg square bracket after Al’s name and the sentence below should have
commas before on and after depends

“Most importantly, we will work even harder with the Postmasters, on whom our business depends, to
ensure that we continue to ...”

I understand why we have the comments coming from Al but I wonder if it looks a bit odd (to the
outside world) that something so significant is not coming from the CEO or the Chairman? I wonder if
either a statement from Tim to add to Al’s would help OR have the comments coming from Jane or
Debbie
