With reference to the call — below is the email (highlighted in red for ease) Belinda was talking about where SS identified
why they wanted the emails

Great — that’s already extremely good news — esp the ‘since’ and the ‘available’.

For what it is worth, whilst we await results from the Horizon black box, attached is the info relevant to email provision
pulled out. It’s a bit of a minefield and needs tidying up, but there are some useful bits in there.

© Initial request from SS was for emails Since 2008
e  Alldata that was Available from April 2008 — March 2013 was supplied
e Old emails are difficult to get hold of as an email archiving system was only installed in Oct 2011

I just do not think we can realistically go back on this issue until we know what is in the black box — or else we leave
ourselves open. I will chase Dave again tomorrow.

I think there are two issues. One is what we say about what we have already provided and second what we provide
going forward.

consider a witness statement. I part completed a note on this basis which I will pick up later. B

Thanks and there is a great deal of sense in that approach.

I think the difficulty I see ahead is that the issue of what we were asked for and what we supplied was made so much of
during the Select Committee evidence session that people will find it hard to accept if we do not say, categorically, that
we were asked for X and we provided X (or X-Y because, eg, the whole of X was no longer available). The argument is no
longer just about what the data may or may not reveal (which your approach would address) but the way in which PO
and SS are working together, it seems to me.

Easy for me to say, I know, and I am no expert but I do wonder quite how hard it is to access the data on that disk if it is
simply password protected — there must be companies out there that do this sort of thing every day, no ?

Hi both,

Though the goal posts moved I think we know, broadly speaking, what we were asked for. However, having spoken to
Dave again this morning — we are not any closer to gaining access to the Hard Drive.

This in mind - can we turn this on its head and say regardless of any debate around data provision — the issue in
question, namely remote access, is no longer a live issue and thus, PO is confused by it re-surfacing at the hearing.

As far as I can see, the below email is the only time lan has given a reason for SS’s request for email records. The
question of Remote Access has been definitively answered time and time again and is now accepted (by PO at least) as
not possible. Unless lan has an additional reason for still wanting these emails, he must be asserting that he does not
believe PO.

It is worth noting that in one of the first notes sent on this topic (Feb 25 2013) Simon Baker of PO stated “It has been
reconfirmed to me that the Test Team do not have access to live data, in any environment”.

As you said earlier this week, there comes a point where SS just have to accept what we say as being true or write in
their P2 report they are not fully satisfied — to which we can then respond.

Mark is in contact with Dave King about this. He chased yesterday but I do not know where he got to today. I have
copied him as he may have an update.

I cannot call as I have no signal on my blackberry.

lam also seeing Jane tomorrow early so maybe we could combine the two?

Best wishes

Just had a chat with Jane — we’re going to sit down together in the morning once we’ve got the better base material
from BD and bash the cover document out — she thinks it should try to be a summary of the key points we make in the
longer doc and that’s what I originally thought too — but in practice to go down that route it need to be very short
indeed and we need really to take the headlines out of the bigger doc. We'll be able to circulate for comments during
the course of tomorrow.

Separately, what is happening on the Dave King code breaking ? We'll need a definitive answer on what we were asked
and what we provided SS in terms of emails from Bracknell.

Julie George came looking for you with a bunch of papers.

Hope all is going as well as it can with your folks.

So, have had a word with Andy and we'll speak again at 1430 but he is now sharpening up the answers to the questions
in the format you’d suggested.

We spoke about the overlay I had envisaged and concluded that, so long as the answers in the longer doc are indeed
sharpened up, there is no point going over the same ground but, instead, make it very short and land no more than 3 or
so key messages.

Are you content with that ?
