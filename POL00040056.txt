Hi All,

Please find attached the draft media Q&A from Ruth with my comments / additions included. It would be good if the five
of us could get together to review before we send on to Angela for her input re Business Improvements.

Glenda would it be possible to find a time that works for Belinda early next week?
Thanks
Sophie
