Dear Paula,

How are you?

I hope your ears were burning lately with support.

I had dinner Thursday

(what a treat to cook a dinner for someone beyond family )

Lord David Hunt

He asked for your address.. I gave it because he wants to support you.
As do I

Can I do anything to help?

I think of you often and this terrible time you are living.

It does feel unfair - British understatement:) and at times relentless. Any advice or thoughts - let me know!
However, I’m focussing on doing plenty of very good things that I can do, rather than dwelling on what I can't @

How are you? Good to hear you've taken up cooking - I don’t remember you having so much time for that when we worked
together. (Me too:)

Thx again,
Paula x

Am not much good at it.. cooking.. but people don't starve.

I give in quantity .. does not compensate for quality...

but what to do at my age?

lam sure you are giving your all to help others.

But don’t forget about yourself!

Horizon is the villain here and thank god we finally learned about the frailty in the system.
We think of it is computerised , it is untamperable, infallible.,...

Not so.

Stand tall.

I know you are a good person and would never never accuse anyone in the wrong.

Thank you - means a lot.

It's so good to read what you write - and to have permission to think about me. You are perceptive - it's not so easy when
others have suffered so much.

Go well and one day, I hope I can buy (!) you a very decent lunch - your cooking sounds like mine!
