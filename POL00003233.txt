Phis is an instance of KEL cardc235Q. Counter 2 did receive the "MSG10802: Top Up
Timed Out" unsuccessful message but debited the customer "MALGORZATA SZCZESIAK" to
he amount of GBP 30.00 anyway.

s stated in the KEL "This may be an issue with script ADCScript-CDBalanceTopUp,
ra user error. [...] The DropaGo scripts are supplied and maintained by ATOS.
Therefore please route calls to ATOS."

lere are the keystrokes and messages from the counter, which might help Atos.
