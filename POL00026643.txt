AB noted the number of extensions being requested by Post Office and queried whether
that was at odds with the approach being taken with Professional Advisors. AVDB is
looking into how this process can be made more efficient, but some cases are taking
longer to investigate due to the complexity of the issues raised. AH pointed out that the

Working Group has not declined any extension requests made by Professional Advisors;

only required that such requests should be put to the Working Group to consider before
the expiry of the deadline and in that regard the Post Office and Professional Advisors
are being dealt with in an even manner. AH said that the Working Group will expect to
see progress with Post Office investigations next week..

Paper from the Chair

AH had prepared a note setting out a proposed structure for Second Sight’s reports. The
WG discussed the note and agreed it was helpful.

AVDB suggested that the fourth box (see paper) be expanded to take into account
whether a Subpostmaster had taken reasonable steps to prevent or mitigate any loss.
AP queried how Second Sight would be approaching similar cases. RW confirmed that
Second Sight would be looking for similar fact patterns between cases (not just relying
on the thematic issues) before drawing conclusions. They would also take into account
how far the facts of each case had been tested through the Scheme.

RW said that he may not be able to come to a conclusion on some of the questions. AH
thought that would be an acceptable position to take if appropriate

AH to amend his note to reflect the discussion and recirculate it to the Working Group.

. AOB

Comments from Second Sight and KL have been received on the letters to Howe & Co
and Aver. AB confirmed he supports KL’s comments and is otherwise content. AH and
BC will revise the letter in light of comments. The Working Group discussed KL’s
comments on the letter to applicants about bankruptcy. Specifically her concerns that a
letter from the Working Group asked that applicants should not include reference to
evidence required by the Post Office in relation to the assignment of claim rights. AP
explained that Post Office would need sight of this evidence before being able to enter
into any settlement and that it would be helpful if applicants were aware of this issue as
soon as possible. AP to consider options and revert back to the Working Group with a
suggestion as to how to proceed.

AH reported on the 3 live criminal cases in the Scheme. One of the cases is in Scotland
and therefore all decisions about that case are being made by the Procurator Fiscal. A
decision has been made by the Post Office on how to proceed with the 2 other cases but
these remain confidential until Post office has notified the individuals. AH impressed on
the Working Group that these matters must remain confidential.
