Hi Peter, please find attached Sue’s “Extra Report’. You will see that the original request from Cash Management was
not for a Special 200 Audit, but an Intervention. The Intervention only asked for a Cash Count as they were worried
about how much cash was being held and the failure of the Postmaster to return some as requested. Obviously one
thing led to another, with the admission of the Postmaster that he was hiding the shortage. Thanks Bob.
