Dave Posnett - I conducted Torch visits to a number of branches on 11/04/13 (security
visits) and whilst at Westerham (FAD 056948), the manager (Atul Desai) just happened to
show me a real time anomaly. He had a customer in front of him who wanted to post a
small standard letter (25g) by recorded delivery (signed for). Atul explained that it should
be £1.70 (and I’ve checked and can confirm that £1.70 is correct). I associate 3 photos
below, which show;

1. The Horizon screen — 11" April (during Torch visit) — screen clearly shows the
weight of 25g in the top right hand corner. However, there are no options displayed
concerning a ‘1% class signed for letter’ at £1.70 (in the left side service column).
Instead the signed for options start at £3.70 for a ‘2 class signed for small parcel’
to £6.75 for a ‘1% class signed for medium parcel’. Atul said he has had problems
re this for the past few days and has to reboot the terminal to rectify, which takes a
number of minutes to perform. He has retained letters and asked customers to pop
back for their receipts/proof of posting (as these are generated from Horizon, once
rebooted and once the ‘1° class signed for letter’ option returns).

2. Branch calendar — on 8" April Atul has written ‘Horizon terminal shows a high
Value in RD [Recorded Delivery]. Rebooted’.

3. Branch calendar — on 9" April Atul has written a similar entry. He has also written
‘Called Helpline 10.15am’, and ‘Jessica H17950181’ and ‘Louise A2636382,

Technical Support’. He was advised to reboot, which he did, and had no problems
for the remainder of 9" April or 10" April.

But the problem did return on 11" April (as per 1 above). When I left the branch the
Horizon system was still rebooting, with a few customers in the queue who couldn't be
served until the reboot had completed.
