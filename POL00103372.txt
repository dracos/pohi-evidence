Subject: POST OFFICE - GROUP LITIGATION, CONFIDENTIAL AND SUBJECT TO LEGAL PRIVILEGE. DO NOT FORWARD
Attachments: Board Report - Final (21.12.18).docx

All

Please find attached a summary of the current status of the Group Litigation, including an update on the hearing of the
Common Issues Trial which concluded on 6 December, and the Horizon trial which commences on 11 March.

We anticipate receiving the draft judgment on the Common Issues in mid-late January, however it will be subject to
embargo so we will not be able to communicate the outcome widely or in detail during the embargo. We are currently
developing the appeal strategy — should that be required, and the paper proposes that any decision to appeal should be
taken by the Chairman, CEO and CFOO. We will be briefing UKGI in early January as the proposed appeal strategy, and
work is well progressed on the communications strategy.

As ever, please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
In the meantime, I wish you all a very Happy Christmas and a prosperous and healthy 2019.
Kind regards,

Jane
