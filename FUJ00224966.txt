Bill,

Thanks for that. I now have what I believe is full authorisation so I'll release my witness statement with the docs.

I have just spoken to Dave King, Security Architect in Post Office® Ltd and he is happy for these documents
to be used in your statement but cannot produce a written confirmation at this time as he is away from the
office. However, he is going to contact Bill Membery/Tom Lillywhite of Fujitsu immediately to confirm that this
document can be used.

As time is of the essence please can you proceed with this statement.

Jarnail,

In order to use these documents I have been asked to “ask the POL solicitors to seek instructions from their
client to ensure that they are happy for Fujitsu to produce this document in court.”

Please can you formally request that and I should then be able to use the documents with my statement.

Regards

Dear Warwick,

Thanks for your constructive feedback.
Here is the updated document.

What I have done today is as follows:

1. I've completed my outstanding analysis of Charles’ Transaction Corrections and also the Cash
movements
2. I've gone through the report and done the following:
FUJ00224966
FUJ00224966

a. Moved most of your comments into “boxes” highlighted in cyan and prefixed them
with “WT” (for the simpler ones I've just made the change and deleted the comment)

b. Attempted to address them all. In most cases I have a response below your comment
prefixed “GlJ”

c. All my changes are in red (including your comments) and I've used “strikeout” to
indicate where I have deleted text

3. I still need to do the following (probably tomorrow):

a. I need to compare Charles’ latest report with the draft and go through my statement
to update it where necessary

b. In particular I've not attempted to address the Travellers’ Cheques issue yet since I
understand that it has changed significantly in the latest report.

c. Remove all the strikeout and boxed comments and make everything black again.
(I've deliberately left the quotes from Charles's report in a smaller font, and plan to
leave them like that, but could indicate them in some other way if you prefer.)

I also have 4 attachments to my statement:

© 3 extracts from Horizons style guide. Note that I have not sought permission to use these yet
o My response to Charles’ Transaction Correction analysis

I'd appreciate any further feedback you may have on my changes so far. I’m also available to discuss
things on the phone if that is easier.

Penny: Please can you find out if there is a problem in using these extracts from SD/STD/001 — The
Horizon Style Guide. I'm not sure who to ask.
Regards

Gareth

All,

It was good to meet you last night and put some faces to names and voices. Following that
I’ve now attempted to draft a Witness Statement as discussed.

<<0a06.Witness statement Gareth Jenkinsv0.1.doc>>

Here is a first draft, and I’d appreciate feedback as to whether I have captured your
requirements as to style and approach. I appreciate that you probably cannot comment on the
factual content.

As agreed, I need to do two further pieces of analysis and I've indicated with highlighted
comments in boxes where I should include these. However I thought it was worth getting a
first draft of the witness statement to you before doing that so you have a chance to review
the Witness Statement in parallel.

I've heard nothing further from Charles McLachlan regarding an updated version of his
Report. Clearly, should such a report appear, I may well need to update the Witness
Statement to reflect any changes.

Regards

Gareth
