4 Assessments

4.1 Integrated Assessment Plan

Details of all these assessments are shown on the Integrated Assessment Schedule and maintained by
the RMG BU Compliance and Quality Team and held on the RMG BU Business Management
SharePoint site. Integrated Assessment Schedule (click this link) and Audit Calendar.

4.2 Assessments conducted

4.2.1. Summary

No internal assessments have been completed on the account since January 2011. Due to the continued
external audits and remedial work required by the customer, no new assessment reports have been
produced. Details of future assessments are detailed on the Integrated Assessment Schedule (click this
link

Ernst and Young have undertaken their annual audit on behalf of PO Ltd in January/February/March.
Their report has been provided to RMG BU for initial comments. RMG BU has commenced plans for the
remediation of the findings and these are to be provided to PO Ltd before the beginning of July 2011.

4.3 Assessments planned
4.3.1 B.V External Audit

The Account has been advised by Group Quality that we are going to be externally audited in September
2011 by B.V. The scope for the audit will include, Supplier Management, Customer Solution
Architecture, and Service Delivery Management.

Initial work has started with the architecture, design and document management teams to review all
relevant documentation for these audits. Fujitsu Sourcing has also been advised of the areas the
auditors are likely to require evidence of. The Service Delivery team have also agreed to review their
documentation and outstanding non-conformances prior to the audit.

Discussions have been held with John Wright (BA) and agreement reached that because of the high
level of customer audit, the BMS team will not audit RMG BU more than 15 days per year.

The existing ISO 9001 certification has now been successfully renewed by our external certification body
Bureau Veritas Certification, following their planned assessment of our relevant operational policies &
processes conducted over the last few months.

4.3.2 Royal Mail Group Business Unit (RMG BU)

As a requirement of the BV audit in September, we are expected to conduct a minimum of 4 internal
audits. To ensure RMG BU has sufficient resources to manage these and other customer audits, an
internal cascade has been issued to request internal Quality Assessors. It is proposed that the audits will
be conducted across the following areas; Commercial & Outsourcing, Incident Management, User
Management, Security Services and Document Management. The initial scope of these audits is
prepared and when resources are available they will be undertaken.

6 Process Improvement
6.1 Quality Leads

Management support is required as part of the RMG BU Compliance Framework to identify new Quality
Leads across all areas of the customer lifecycle.

6.2 Quality and Compliance Framework

RMG BU has contractual, legislative and compliance requirements placed upon it by its stakeholders
and evidence that these are met is required as part of its Customer Lifecycle Gateways and as part of its
internal and external audits.

RMG BU has developed a draft framework which will be discussed at the next Quality Management
Review on 7th June 2011.

RMG BU has discussed informally with PO Ltd the concept of a governance framework and they are
interested in the idea. They like us can see business benefits of undertaking targeted audits of specific
areas of a framework as it would save the costs, resources and time spent in the many audits that RMG
BU and PO Ltd are required to undergo. PO Ltd agreed to look at the idea in further depth and discuss
with RMG BU following the Ernst and Young audit.

Internally, RMG BU has begun to adopt some of the concepts defined in the framework for new
business. As a result of the Framework, discussions are being undertaken on joint business impact
assessment to ensure that controls to meet these are included.

RMG BU has also begun discussing with BMS how this framework will link into its processes.

7 Measures

7.1 Customer Satisfaction and Complaints
We have completed a full review of the CSIP, CSS and USAT process for the RMG BU.

Anew format and structure has been agreed with PO Ltd. We have adopted the Corporate CSS
approach and the first quarterly customer interview will be conducted in June 2011.

7.1.1 Customer Satisfaction Interview Programme - CSIP

As part of the formal CSIP, we follow up with the client as to the areas they would like us to focus on.
These may not necessarily be areas of dissatisfaction, but areas they are requesting we continue to
focus on. A draft action plan has been created to address these areas and is now being reviewed by
senior management before being sent to PO Ltd for approval.

The CSIP target for RMG BU for 2011/2012 is shown below.

USAT surveys are conducted each month by the Help Desk contacting a sample of Postmasters
(typically less than 50% respond to these requests). The USAT survey data for May has been added and
this continues to show little change in the levels of satisfaction quoted which remains at acceptable
levels. There is a service improvement plan in place to address the issues that led to the low score for
Q4 this month compared to the score of 4.5 in April.
