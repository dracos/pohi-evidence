In anticipation of (hopefully) getting the green light for this application from PO, please see attached the
application documents. There are various bits to be filled in (particularly references in the WS).

Grateful if everyone could take a careful look at all of these though.

I have gone for a time estimate for the hearing of 4 hrs. Thoughts on that appreciated too.

Thanks

Gideon
