Recent outages affecting all of the PO branches live on the HNG-X application are
resulting in serious customer concerns.

Various letters have been received from POL Directorate and from the National
Federation of Sub-postmasters expressing their concern in regards to the instability of the
new system.

There have been 4 major outages affecting the customer’s business running on Horizon
on-line over the last week

Downgrade Criteria: Agreed Plan in place with required resources secured (people,
hardware, toolsets e.g Configuration Management).

Closure Criteria:

- No major incidents or service outages affecting more than 25% of the HNG-X counters
for 4 weeks.

- Platform stability illustrated through Customer agreed capacity and performance
measures.

- Event management filtering and aggregation at a point where the risk of oversight of a
major issue is negligible.

- Rate of increase in new live defects to flatten or drop.

- All contractual Service Level Targets can be measured and are met for a period of 1
month

An Oracle Patch Set that resolves the specific observed Oracle error which impacts all
HNG-X branches (and has been confirmed by Oracle as addressing the issue) is
undergoing live system testing and will be validated over the next couple of days with
implementation in the live environment planned for Sunday. There is ongoing technical
dialogue with Oracle regarding the remaining issues.

A Technical Project Manager (Shaun Wood) has been appointed for the Systems
Management Workstream.

A plan including a cost base and resource requirements is being produced.
Communication Channels are being agreed with the customer.

Actions raised in the Exec Call at 1800hrs today to progress the immediate resource
requirements;

Problem Management Resource — Vince Cochrane to review with Dean Forth (Manager,
Major Incident Management).

Infrastructure Resources - Peter Thompson to provide Phil Dunmore (Infrastructure
Deployment) with details on required resources

Current pilot for HNG-X has been halted due to live operational issues affecting all HNG-
X branches. POL are getting an influx of calls from Postmasters complaining about lost
business due to the number of outages. May potentially result in claims for service credits
and / or liquidated damages
