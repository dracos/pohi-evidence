5. ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

This section lists the identifier of each Acceptance Criterion that will be demonstrated by
the Acceptance Test. It also lists the Acceptance Test Conditions that are used to
determine whether (or not) the Acceptance Criterion has been met together with the
applicable test Phase.

5.1 ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA AND TEST CONDITIONS

Conformance of the Reconciliation Acceptance Criteria will be demonstrated through
Acceptance Trials and/or Acceptance Reviews.

Tests conducted by Acceptance Trials comprise practical tests using prepared test scripts.
If applicable the Test Condition(s) appropriate to a criterion are specified in section 5.1.1
together with a description of the test. Detailed composition of the test in terms of
sequences of Test Conditions is contained in Section 10. In the tables in section 5.1.1 the
rows labelled Function Run entry will be populated immediately prior to the running of
the Acceptance Trials in a working version of the Acceptance Test Specification. These
will provide invigilators with references to the checklists used to monitor the progress of
the testing. The order of running of Test Conditions will not necessarily correspond to
the order presented in HLTPs because of the “physicalisation” of the testing. The
Function Run entry will allow the invigilator to read across from the criterion to the
checklist.

Tests conducted by Acceptance Review comprise typically Document inspections, site
visits or presentations. If applicable the Test Condition(s) are described in section 5.1.2.

6. ACCEPTANCE INCIDENT SEVERITY

This section identifies the guidelines to be applied during the analysis of Acceptance
Incidents, in order to establish the severity of such Acceptance Incidents.

6.1 HIGH SEVERITY INCIDENTS

Failure to meet an Acceptance Criterion which would have a substantive impact on the
service received by the Customer, e.g. failure to pay benefits to the right person, at the
tight place, at the right time.

Failure to meet an Acceptance Criterion which would have a major impact on the ability
of the AUTHORITY or AUTHORITIES to perform their business, or where there was a
major impact on the resources of the AUTHORITY or AUTHORITIES necessary to
overcome that impact on their business, e.g. failure to support accurate POCL accounting.

Failure to meet an Acceptance Criterion which would impact the security of the service
where there is no procedural workaround.

Consistent failure to meet Minimum Acceptable Thresholds for Service Levels, e.g. where
particular transactions do not meet the minimum Acceptable Threshold under normal
loading.

6.2. MEDIUM SEVERITY INCIDENTS

Failure to meet an Acceptance Criterion which is visible to the Customer and is likely to
give rise to an adverse public perception of the service, but does not substantively impact
the service received by the Customer, e.g. incorrect spelling on a receipt.

Failure to meet an Acceptance Criterion which would have a medium impact on the
ability of the AUTHORITY or AUTHORITIES to perform their business, or where there
was a medium impact on the resources of the AUTHORITY or AUTHORITIES necessary
to overcome that impact on their business, e.g. non-production of a weekly report,
resulting in its manual transcription, which causes additional resource or effort at every
outlet of the average duration of one hour per week per outlet.

Ps 9 Acceptance Test Specification Date: 22/12/98

Occasional failure to meet Minimum Acceptable Thresholds for Service Levels, e.g. at
peak loading, some transactions fail to meet Minimum Acceptable Thresholds, but on
average all transactions within the service do achieve Minimum Acceptable Thresholds.

6.3 LOW SEVERITY INCIDENTS

Failure to meet an Acceptance Criterion that is neither visible to nor has substantive
impact on the service received by the Customer e.g. presentational, style and other
cosmetic faults that are only visible to the user.

Failure to meet an Acceptance Criterion which would have a minor impact on the ability
of the AUTHORITY or AUTHORITIES to perform their business, or where there was a
minor impact on the resources of the AUTHORITY or AUTHORITIES necessary to
overcome that impact on their business, e.g. non-production of a weekly report, resulting
in its manual transcription, which causes additional resource or effort at ten or fewer
outlets of the average duration of one hour per week per outlet.

Failure to meet an Acceptance Criterion which would impact the security of the service
but where the workaround is as secure as the original solution (i.e. the only impact on risk
is in ensuring that the workaround is performed, but where procedures have been agreed
and are in place).
