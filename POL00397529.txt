1 Privileged IT We reviewed privileged access to IT functions We recommend that management
access including access to user administration functionality conducts a review of privileged access to

across the in-scope applications and their supporting
infrastructure. Whilst we noted some reduction on the
number of accounts assigned with privileged access

to POLSAP, the following observations identified last

year remained open at the time of our review:

POLSAP

e The following seven dialog and service generic
accounts were found to be assigned to the
SAP_ALL and SAP_NEW profiles within the
POLSAP production environment (PLP-400):

o ADMINBATCH

o BASISADMIN

o DDIC (assigned to the SAP_ALL profile only)
o OTUSER

o SAP*

o SOLMANPLMS500

o WF-ADMIN.

Users with SAP_ALL access have unrestricted
access to POLSAP, including the capability to
process and approve financial transactions. The
SAP_NEW profile provides general access to
new profiles and authorisations which are
included in a new SAP release.

* The SAP* and DDIC accounts were not locked.

IT functions across the in-scope
applications and their supporting
infrastructure to determine whether the
level of privileged access granted is
appropriate. Where access is deemed to
be inappropriate, this access should be
revoked immediately.

For POLSAP accounts associated to the
SAP_ALL and SAP_NEW profiles,
management should revisit the need to
grant this level of privileged access to the
production environment. Access to
accounts with the SAP_ALL and
SAP_NEW profiles should only be used
when needed.

Where privileged POLSAP accounts are
used to configure and run scheduled jobs,
management should consider creating
system accounts to run scheduled jobs so
manual login is not allowed and individual
dialog accounts to configure scheduled
jobs in order to promote accountability.

Where it is unavoidable to remove
SAP_ALL and SAP_NEW access, it is
recommended that a periodic review of the
activities executed by the accounts
granted permanent SAP_ALL and
SAP_NEW access is performed to gain
assurance that no inappropriate or
unauthorised activity has been performed

Management Comment

This does not meet recommended practice of
removing all profiles from SAP* and locking both
the SAP* and DDIC accounts. We also noted that
the SAP* account had a last login date during the
audit period and that the DDIC account is
associated to the S_A.SYSTEM privileged
profile.

Refer to Appendix A for detail on the accounts
identified to have privileged access to POLSAP.

HNGX

We understand that Fujitsu has undertaken actions to
investigate some of the inappropriate privileged
access identified from last year's audit, however the
prior year observations noted below for HNGX were
still valid at the time our review.

e There are inappropriate system privileges
assigned to the APPSUP role and
SYSTEM_MANAGER role at the Oracle
database level on the Branch Database server
(BDB) supporting HNGX.

e There is inappropriate privileged access at the
Oracle database level on the Transaction
Processing System server (DAT) supporting
HNGX:

o System privileges assigned to the APPSUP
role and OPS$TPS account are
inappropriate.

o The following accounts associated to the
DBA role are no longer required:

which may adversely impact the financial
statements.

Management should implement monitoring
controls to help ensure that controls
operated by the third party service
providers are in place and are in
operation, for example, monitoring of
appropriateness of access to privileged
users/profiles.

POLSAP.

We found a POL employee who left on 04/06/11
but the account remained active up to 23/09/11.
Further investigation showed that this delay was
caused by late notification from the line manager.

As we observed in the 2010/11 audit, POL cash
centre managers are granted limited access to
user administration in POLSAP through
transaction SUO7 allowing them to assign cash
centre profiles to users within their depot. As
such there is a lack of segregation of duties
between the authorisation and granting of access
to cash centre users.

In response to our comments last year, POL has
implemented a process whereby a form is
required to authorise the temporary assignment
of roles to cash centre users and a monthly
review is performed to check that roles assigned
to cash centre staff do not create a segregation
of duties conflict.

However, based on our walkthrough and testing
samples of 27 new and modified user access to

form is completed. Furthermore,
management should consider
implementing a monitoring control to
ensure that the process implemented
for assigning temporary access to cash
centre users is being adhered to.

« Implement a monitoring process
around the activities of privileged
users (i.e. cash centre managers with
access to SU01). Where part of the
user administration process is
controlled by third party service
providers, management should ensure
adequate monitoring controls are in
place to help ensure the controls
operate as intended.

HNGX and POLSAP

e Strengthen the revocation of access
process such that IT is notified in a
timely manner when a terminated
employee no longer requires access to
POLSAP and the HNGX estates.
Consideration should be given to the
HR department sending a list of
terminated employees to the IT
department on a periodic basis, e.g.
weekly or fortnightly. This is in addition
to the line manager notifying the IT
department of the terminated
employee. All documentation
supporting this process should be

co For one cash centre user modification the

the supply chain user administration process
rather than the process for assigning

We reviewed the processes implemented to
determine that all program changes are appropriately
authorised, tested and approved prior to
implementation into the production environment for
the applications in scope. Whilst we noted some
improvements on the process compared to last year,
some of the points raised last year have not been
fully remediated. Specifically, we noted the following :

POLSAP production environment during the audit

evidence that the changes had been tested by
Fujitsu, the name of the person who performed
the testing was not recorded

of this nature.

HNGX

Based on our walkthrough and testing samples of 11

back end changes, 11 counter changes and six

manual changes made to the live HNGX estate
during the audit period, we noted the following:

« For two manual changes and three back end

Periodic user
access
reviews and
monitoring
controls

In the 2010/11 audit we recommended improvements
to the periodic user access review process and
monitoring controls. Whilst we have noted the efforts
by management to strengthen the control
environment this year, we noted opportunities to
improve the process further.

HNGX

Whilst we have been advised that there is a new
process in place this year for the periodical review of
the appropriateness of access assigned to the HNGX
estate, we understand that this is based on a
database that records access granted and
terminated, rather than on user access listings.

diminishes the effectiveness of the control.

Our user appropriateness review identified one user
account that no longer required access to HNGX

Whilst we note that there is a process in place to
review the appropriateness of P&BA and Supply

Management should consider the
implementation of a POL owned periodic
review of appropriateness of access to in-
scope applications and their supporting
infrastructure. The implementation of this
review will assist in the identification of
inappropriate access and potential
segregation of duties conflicts. In addition,
this will act as an additional control to help
detect users that no longer require access
tothe financial applications.

The following outlines how this process
may be implemented:

e User listings containing all active users

relevant department managers

o Whether the current access of
their employees is in line with their
