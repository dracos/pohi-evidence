Subject: Audit Strengthening - potential CP

Pete,
I have recently taken over as the HNG-X Project Manager for Business Applications which includes
responsibility for Audit.

I have been made aware of a potential high priority CP for Audit Strengthening which I believe is currently
sitting with you. I am concerned that it is late in the day for us to be considering change of this potential
magnitude. There is a very high risk that we will not be able to do the work in time for release 1 of HNG-X.

I will be taking PM ownership of this issue from the HNG-X Programme perspective and need to work with
you to get any necessary change driven through.

I suggest that we arrange a meeting early next week to move this forward. I propose the following attendees;
Steve Evans, Alan Holmes, Graham Allen, Adam Cousins. Is there anyone I have missed? I am in the office
Mon, Tue & Wed next week. Which is the best day for you?

I look forward to your reply. Please give me a call if you wish to discuss.

08/12/2008
Regards

David
