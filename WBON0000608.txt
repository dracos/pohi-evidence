Please see final confirmation from Counsel that these statements will not be served.
Andy are you happy for Ed/ Helen To let Alison and Kendra know this, and saying we will need to finalise

the statements in a couple of weeks for potential use for the Horizon issues trial? Please thank them for their
efforts.

Also Mark U is coordinating availability / cover and Angela is creating a team approach so is it ok for me to
let them know too? I’ll explain we will need time from them but not availability throughout November.

Thanks

Dear Andy,

I agree. I cannot see how either statement is material to the Common Issues.

WBD_000478.000001
WBONO0000608
WBON0000608

A few quick observations on the content (for another day):

(1) As a matter of presentation, it would be good not to refer to the provision of “services” by Post Office
to SPMs (here, the Helpline). I know that it is common in big organisations refer to any assistance or
interaction as a “service” provided to a “customer” (see HMRC for example), but we should avoid this
language where possible because of the Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982.

(2) There are a few unhelpful passages in the Dickinson statement where she puts things a lot lower than I
would expect — for example, she does not reject in strong terms the suggestion that Helpline advisers may
have advised SPMs to submit false accounts. I expect this is because the draft is in a relatively early stage
of development, but I raise it now because it is potentially an important point. Surely any adviser providing
that kind of highly inappropriate advice would be in breach of important rules and guidance, would be
taken to task, etc etc (?)

Kind Regards,

Owain

Andy,

I have now been through these - my view is that they are almost entirely inadmissible (although obviously

likely to be relevant to breach in due course). Small sections in the Bolsover statement are admissible, but

these overlap with evidence which is already being given by other witnesses. So my view is that we should
not serve either statement (or take any sections for deployment in other statements).

All best

Owain, Gideon

Please find attached the draft statements of

1. Kendra Dickinson — which principally relates to supports for postmaster
2. Alison Bolsover — which principally relates to Transaction Corrections and debt recovery

We had these put together to gain a understanding of these areas but my view is that (i) we don't need the
level of detail covered by these statements and (ii) this is all largely inadmissible.

Would you mind briefly reviewing and then advising on:

1. Whether we need these statements at all?

2. If there are any sections / paragraphs in these statements that might be useful? If there are short bits we
might be able to include these in someone else's statement.

Thanks
Andy
