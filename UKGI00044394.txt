Financial sustainability.

POL had been increasingly profitable pre-Covid-19, generating £83m of trading profit for
2019/20. In 2020/21 POL performed well above expectations, now forecasting trading profit
of £34m (budget of £9m), mainly due to a particularly good year for its mails business from
the increase of home delivery and parcels. Travel restrictions meant POL’s travel insurance
and foreign currency businesses were hit hard. POL sold its Telecoms business to Shell in
2020/21 for strategic reasons.

POL originally budgeted £36m trading profit for 2021/22. Further to UKGI and POL Board
challenge, a higher budget of £52m has been set with more positive views on labels volume
for parcels and a likely improvement in POL’s travel-related businesses.

POL will receive funding of £227m from BEIS in 2021/22 (per the one-year Autumn 2020
Spending Review) comprising £125m investment funding, a £52m loan and a continued £50m
subsidy for the uncommercial network. POL’s future commercial sustainability will again be a
key consideration in the next Spending Review. REDACTION

Governance.

POL’s leadership turnover is stabilising under the new CEO who is making a positive impact.
Two Postmaster NEDs have just been appointed to the Board following a successful election
that concluded on April 12. POL will be seeking to appoint a new NED with legal expertise to
oversee a sub-committee on legal settlements. With respect to the 2 NEDs whose terms
expire in January 2022 - POL will be seeking to extend Carla Stent's tenure for a third term,
whilst seeking to replace Ken McCall.

The CEO is seeking to replace the current CFO. POL is proposing that the current CFO stay on
till end August to ensure full cooperation with the Horizon Inquiry before a new permanent
CFO is appointed. Ministerial Approval will be required with respect to the exit terms, as well
as approval for the proposed remuneration package for the new permanent. yap erent
