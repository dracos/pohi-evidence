Thanks — please find attached the “final” version of the SS report (+ a comparison showing the changes from the last
version). ft is still sub-standard and most of the content has not changed. Any thoughts from a criminal law perspective
would be most weicome.

Kind regards
Andy

I have discussed this Martin and Simon who have been prosecuting for POL for some years. As things presently stands
they advise that they would not propose any amendments to Rodric letter. So far as the draft report is concerned ,it is
only a draft and as pointed out it is collection of unsubstantiated allegations and it also makes reference to further
enquires being made by POL and second sight . As such we cannot comment at this stage. We would wish to see final
version of the report containing details of the enquires being carried out and reasoned and evidenced conclusions , to
enable us to make disclosure decisions.

Thanks for this. I am running number of issues past CK given they have been conducting POLS prosecutions for the last
couple of years.

Second Sight have produced a draft of their "Part 2 Report" (attached). This report is supposed to draw together their
analysis of any thematic issues that affect Applicants generally. The intention is that, once finalised, this report will be
sent to Applicants with SS' individual case review reports.

In general, the Part 2 Report is very poor quality and Post Office have responded to Second Sight highlighting all the
inaccuracies and deficiencies (see attached). We are waiting to see if SS will take these comments on-board in a revised
draft due shortly.

In the meantime, would you or CK be able to review the Report and advise on whether, at this stage, the draft report gives
rise to criminal law issues (I'm thinking in particular about whether there are any disclosure issues)?

Kind regards
Andy
