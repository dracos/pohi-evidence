Subject: RE: Information Requests from Jason Coyne [BD-4A.FID27032497]

Matthew,
Starter for 10 as follows:

1.13

There is no functionality in Horizon for either a branch, Post Office or Fujitsu to modify or remove transaction data
once it has been recorded in a branch’s accounts. It is only possible to post auditable correcting transactions to a
branch's accounts.

In the very rare circumstances when an accounting error cannot be corrected by POLs use of a TC and it is necessary

for support to make such a correction it has been subject to whatever change approval process is in use at that time.
Currently MSC, latterly, OCP. These systems will contain full details of the required correction, method of execution,
approvals etc.

There is no log for support read only access to review data.

1.14

Support access defined in SVM/SEC/PRO/1780 (Service Delivery Units Roles Responsibilities and Access
Requirements). Access is facilitated by tooling such as SSH / Telnet from the support servers within the Horizon data
centre. If should be noted that there are no facilities to remotely access the CBA at a branch. See also
DES/SYM/HLD/0017 (REMOTE SUPPORT ACCESS HIGH LEVEL DESIGN) and ARC/SYM/ARC/0004 (HNG-X SYSTEM AND.
ESTATE MANAGEMENT REMOTE ACCESS AND DIAGNOSTICS)

1.15

As 1.13, there is no such thing in Horizon as a transaction amendment. Additional correcting transactions entered via
the Transaction Correction Tool (DEV/APP/LLD/0142 HOST BRDB TRANSACTION CORRECTION TOOL LOW LEVEL
DESIGN) are uniquely identified and recorded in the audit trail. I believe they will have the ID of the support user so
clearly not a user from the branch. For TCs (transaction corrections) originating from POL, when the SPM accepts the
correction, it will be logged into their accounts as with any other transaction performed by that Branch user.

1.16

Haven't seen POL-0032939.doc. Are we talking about the Transaction correction tool here (again ref
DEV/APP/LLD/0142) in which case answer is as per 1.13, change approval process (MSC) and information
automatically entered into the audit trail.

Steve,

Please see the attached Word doc from WBD; the original document is generated by Freeths and the bubbled
comments are from WBD; in Pete Newsome’s email below, in the table, are the question numbers that he agreed
with WBD that we would attempt to provide information on, mainly in the form of document references, bearing in
mind that they already have all the documentation from Dimensions for Horizon and HNG-X, so we are just pointing
out which are relevant.

The other attachment is where we are up to with that so far, so document references, titles plus a few comments,
listed against the question numbers.

Questions 1.13 to 1.16 all relate to issues around remote access to the live system and corrections, etc. Something
I’ve tried to point out is that there are two different processes both named “Transaction Correction” ~ one is the TPS /
POL Finance Systems corrections generated wholly within POL which are delivered via the file described in
EA/IFS/002, and I understand this happens regularly. The other is the “Transaction Correction Tool” which is
described in DEV/APP/LLD/0142, and which happens very rarely (once?); this is where I am getting referred to SSC.
Are you able to provide additional information in response to the questions in the comments labelled JONATHANG for
1.13 to 1.16? Are there logs of it being requested, being done, what is the procedure for authorising and doing it,
etc.?

Please feel free to make suggestions on any other parts of the sheet or questions as well. Pete has already shared a
slightly earlier version of this sheet with WBD and has promised further detail.

I received the above request for information from WBD this week and after discussion I think we are in the frame for
the following. Unless we need to pull some specific logs such as the use of privileged users we need to identify the
correct documents to inform the IT experts. Matthew I am sure can supply the documents.

Pete,

I've cancelled the 10:00am call as Paul Smith isn’t available, but I'll give you a call now to use the time to discuss this.
I agree that some of the requests are for Post Office — sorry, I should have said that I'm seeking their input too.

Jonathan

Initial thoughts are that this would take some time to compete as it covers a number of areas of responsibility in
Fujitsu.

We can perhaps pick this up at 10.00. In the way the questions are worded we can only give an answer for the
position now to re-build the total position at any point in time would be extremely time consuming if not possible due
to the constant changes occurring to the systems and processes.

Some of the answers on process will be more related to Post Office processes rather than those of Fujitsu so will need
to be dovetailed together.

Su ject: Information equests from Jason Coyne [BD-4A.FID27032497]

Pete,

We have received the attached set of information requests from Jason Coyne. We are expecting further requests
from him over the next few days.
FUJ00222620
FUJ00222620

As you will see, the requests are by and large poorly drafted and lacking focus (for example, none of them specify a
date or date range to which they relate). However, we need to respond to them as best we can and quickly to reduce
the scope for the Claimants to argue that Post Office is impeding the work of the experts.

Our view is that the majority are actually requests for documents. We'd be grateful if you and Matthew would take a
look and let us know whether you think we can refer Coyne to the relevant documents (bearing in mind that the
Claimants’ allegations go back to 1999 so we should be providing the key documents spanning that period). I've
added some comments which will hopefully help you to decipher Coyne's requests.

Would you be able to get back to me today please? I'm available for a call this afternoon if it would help to run
through them?

Kind regards

Jonny
