Ps this sounded like I was shifting the blame on to Sue - not her fault in the slightest but our internal follow up meeting
was rescheduled twice. In hindsight I should have contacted Mr B immediately with a bland holding reply rather than
waiting for greater clarity on how we would deal with the JFSA proposal.

\ tried calling Mr Bates yesterday to update him on our process, and will make sure I make contact with him today by
phone or email.

The delay was due to me waiting to hear back from Sue and team on how we would deal with their proposal - didn't
want to raise his expectations prematurely about how we would be able to respond.

Hi Theresa,

Just to let you know that Alan Bates from the Justice for SubPostmasters Alliance has called, saying he has yet
to hear from Martin and/or Paula, and was rather expecting to have had something by now. I promised him I
would pass this on.

Kind regards
Janet

Thanks Theresa,

Just to confirm that we spoke, and agreed a meeting between Paula, James, and Mr Bates of the Justice for
Subpostmasters Alliance, to take place:

Thursday 4 October

liam

In James’ office here at Portcullis House.

Iam sure Paula knows the drill, but just in case she needs reminding, could she come to reception here and
ask the staff to call me on extension and I shall come and collect her.

If there are any problems, do let me know. I do not anticipate having to change the timing, but if I need to, it
will be because something has snuck up on us, and I will give you as much advance notice as possible.

With thanks and kind regards,

Good afternoon, Janet

Following a recent meeting James had with Alice Perkins, I understand he would like a meeting with Paula before the
Conservative Party Conference starts, with Mr Bates.

Would you kindly let me have some dates/times suitable in the next two weeks?
I hope you have a good weekend.

Kind regards
Theresa
