Jonny,

In relation to the following questions on the attached (answers are also on the attachment):

The SLA reports that Fujitsu have provided to POL monthly from April 2002 to July 2018 have now been
uploaded to a new folder “Fujitsu SLA Reports” in your HighQ repository. Please note that between 2002
and August 2010 the SLAs are included within the body of one or more reports which are provided as either
Word or PDF format, over time the exact format of what was provided evolves somewhat. From September
2010 on the SLAs are provided in a standalone Excel file each month. From my checks I noted that there are
no reports for September 2005 and November 2007.

) List of TFS closed with SD codes sent by Dave Ibbett at 09:50 07-Aug-2018.

Peak does not currently have a mechanism to export the 222,000 problems / incidents from the last 18
years. For a meaningful export it would need both the narrative and the evidence attached. This evidence
will include large files (e.g. Database dumps). It would be possible to develop an application to export the
Peaks only, minus attached evidence. The TfS system contains 32462 records from the last 18 months, and
we have requested a dump of the system but this will not be ready for sharing by 08-Aug-2018.

) Asv).

) We received this from Torstein: / am puzzled by the statement that “PO was making TC decisions based on
the filtered not the unfiltered.” I don't think POL make TC decisions based on ARQ data as to do so would
imply a very unwieldy process. The delta between filtered and unfiltered data depends on the filter applied.
Unfiltered data is the set of all audit data (for a branch). A filter will result in some data (presumably
deemed irrelevant to a particular purpose) not being included in the resulting ARQ. We have previously
provided a list of the filters that have been set up in the ARO system.

Matthew, Dave,

Further to my email below please find attached a draft of Post Office's response to Mr Coyne's 20 July email that Lucy
has prepared based on your responses so far, which we need to finalise and serve by 4:00pm tomorrow.

Thank you for your considerable efforts so far. Please would you take a look and provide the missing information
ASAP today so that we can close this one off?

Kind regards

Matthew,

Thank you for your responses on this. Can you let me know the current position in relation to the sections highlighted
yellow? A few thoughts:-

can we do something similar to what we did with the KELs for the PEAK/TfS systems?

what manual analysis would you need to do to work out how many OCPs there are and can it be done by
Wednesday?

what are OCRs used for?

Kind regards

Jonny

Pete, Matthew, Dave,

As discussed on the call just now, please can you let us know what the art of the possible is in relation to the following
requests:-

v) PEAK and/or TfS records where the error or issue resulted in financial impact to either Post Office or a
Subpostmaster.

[Matthew Lenton] Whilst this type of action may have been taken by SSC it would have been in the
context of an individual incident. All incidents are recorded but the system was designed to manage
individual operations not for statistical reporting for when a particular action has been taken by a
Support Consultant. Fujitsu will be able to answer questions on individual branch queries where the data
is still available.

Is it possible to provide a dump of the entire PEAK database, which he can run up on SQL server or the appropriate
DBMS? Or could we give the experts access to the PEAK / TfS systems?

I (anne

vi) PEAK and/or TfS records for any Claimant who has a record including any audit data for the period (at least a
month) of the PEAK/TfS record.

[Matthew Lenton] We would need to know which claimants; we would then need to carry out the search
for each claimant, this is a time consuming manual task.

As above.

viii) A copy of any Master Service Change ("MSC") OR Operational Corrective Requests ("OCR") OR Operation
Control Procedures ("OCP") [as outlined in POL-0074909] where the data to be changed has had a financial impact on
Post Office or where they relate to fixing a peak.

[Matthew Lenton] We know that there are in excess of 18,000 MSCs and would predict that there are
OCRs
would not be relevant to this as they would not be used for any such change.

How many MSC, OCR, and OCP are there? By what means could they be provided to the experts?

I look forward to hearing from you.
