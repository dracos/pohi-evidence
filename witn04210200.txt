POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY

SECOND WITNESS STATEMENT OF ROBERT GEORGE WILSON

|, ROBERT GEORGE WILSON, will say as follows:

This witness statement is made to assist the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry (the
“Inquiry”) with the matters set out in the Rule 9 Request dated 19th October 2023 (the
“Request’). The statement, my second made in the Inquiry, covers action taken by
Post Office Ltd (“POL”) against Subpostmasters. My first witness statement, dated 11
May 2023, was made in response to a Rule 9 Request dated 14 April 2023. | repeat
the contents of that statement to the extent that they are relevant to the most recent

Request.
The Prosecution of Seema Misra

1. | first became involved in the case of Seema Misra when | allocated the case to

Mr Jarnail Singh to deal with the prosecution. | make the following comments:

1.1, | recall that Mr Warwick Tatford was instructed as Counsel by Mr Singh
and represented POL in the prosecution of Seema Misra. Thereafter my

involvement was restricted to a letter | wrote to Miss Issy Hogg, Mrs
Page 1 of 35
WITN04210200
WITN04210200

Misra's solicitor, dated 15.09.2010 serving a schedule of non-sensitive
unused material (POL00055236) and serving a disc containing Horizon
data on Miss Issy Hogg dated 05.03.2010 (POL00054303). | do not recall
why | wrote the letters referred to but can only assume that Mr Singh was
out of the office at the time and | considered that the letters should not be
delayed until his return but | cannot say for certain. Mr Singh may have
sought my advice from time to time but | cannot recall any specific
instance or advice provided. | can see that an attendance note written
by Mr Singh refers to myself being asked about a refusal by Fujitsu to
allow Gareth Jenkins to meet the Defence expert. My advice appears to
be that someone would need to attend Court from Fujitsu to explain why
authority for the experts to meet was not given but | cannot recall this.
The authority for the experts to meet was granted shortly after the Fujitsu
representative received this message (POL00054999). | do recall that
issues concerning disclosure were referred to the Judge dealing with the

prosecution of Seema Misra but was not involved in these proceedings.

As the Criminal Team Leader (“CTL”) | was responsible for all of the
prosecutions conducted by POL which included Royal Mail and
Parcelforce prosecutions. | was also responsible for advising the
Business and dealing with POL’s relationships with external bodies such
as the Courts. | managed my team, agents and Counsel. | estimate that
the time | had to spend on POL work was probably less than 15% of my
working time. | did not have a great deal of involvement in other lawyers'
cases albeit if there was an issue on any prosecution or any member of

with by Mr Singh.
The charges that appeared on the summonses were drafted by Mr Singh.
| do not know who authorised the prosecution of Seema Misra.

| understand from the documents that the disclosure officer was Mr John

Longman.

As set out above, my role in relation to disclosure in these proceedings was
restricted to writing a letter to Miss Issy Hogg dated 15.09.2010 and serving a
schedule of non-sensitive unused material (POL00055236). | also served a disc

containing Horizon data on Miss Izzy Hogg dated 05.03.2010 (POL00054303).

| do not recall when | first became aware that there was a challenge to the integrity
of the Horizon IT system in this case but have looked at an attendance note
prepared by Mr Singh dated 3/6/2009 (POL00051773) regarding the trial that was

listed the previous day. | understand from the documents that the issue of the

integrity of Horizon was raised by the Defence at court on 2/6/2009. | believe that

I may have been told shortly after this date but cannot recall precisely when.

| am not sure when | first became aware of the contractual issue raised in relation

to the ARQ material. My view was if ARQ data was relevant to POL’s prosecution

cases it should be obtained irrespective of any contractual provision in the

contract between POL and Fujitsu.

In relation to those documents

11.1. | do not recall my view of the Defence requests in December 2009
(POL00053723). | appear to have simply forwarded the email to Mr Singh
who was dealing with the prosecution. My view on any issue of disclosure
however would have been that if POL could comply with the requests and
assist the Defence then such action should be taken.

11.2. | do not recall providing any advice on the merits of disclosure requests
made by the Defence at this or any stage of the prosecution.

Page 6 of 35
WITN04210200
WITN04210200

11.3. Counsel provided advice in January 2010. I do not recall the advice which
would have been sent to Mr Singh.

11.4. | do not recall what the reaction was by POL to Counsel’s Advice. | note
paragraph 23 of Counsel's Advice and also note Juliet McFarlane’s
concern. | do not remember either Ms McFarlane or Mr Singh raising
these matters with me but, had they done so, | would have asked them
to liaise with Mr Tatford Prosecuting Counsel.

11.5. | note from the attendance note (POL00053849) that reference is made
to Prosecuting Counsel being the only person who could comment on
"case papers" which | assume was a reference to the prosecution papers
concerning Mr Hosi but cannot be sure. | do not recall this case. |
understand that Counsel was able to see the case papers as the
instructing solicitor was Ms McFarlane and she had instructed Counsel
working in the same chambers as Mr Tatford.

11.6. Ido not recall whether Counsel advised after January 2010 or the nature
of any advice.

11.7. | have no recollection of Defence disclosure requests in so far as they
related to the Horizon IT system. | understand from the document that
Prosecuting Counsel was referred to in the attendance note dated 27
January 2010 (POL00053849) where he was recorded as saying that:
"... we should disclose everything we can disclose at this stage so the
defence will know where we are coming from. We should be seen to be
willing".

| believe the PO endeavoured to heed this advice.

Page 7 of 35
WITN04210200
WITN04210200

11.8. Each morning | received the post and allocated it to the relevant members
of my team. Accordingly, as | dealt with this disclosure, | assume that Mr

Singh was absent from the office at the time. In order to deal with the

schedule of non-sensitive material | will have had to retrieve the case

papers, check the previous disclosure schedule of non-sensitive material
and then dictate the letter informing the Defence that the additions to the
schedule commenced at entry number 19. In addition, had there been
copy documents I would have copied them before sending to the Defence

Solicitors. | believe | will have reviewed the papers to understand whether

the PO’s obligations had been complied with but cannot recall doing so.

Had | any concerns | would have raised them with Mr Singh or

Prosecuting Counsel.

12. Ihave considered:
12.1. the email from Issy Hogg dated 1 March 2010 at POL00054248;
12.2. _ the notification of fixture dated 2 March 2010 at POL00054275;
12.3. the email from Warwick Tatford dated 8 March 2010 and draft skeleton
argument at POL00054335 and POL00054346; and
12.4. the emails dated 11 and 16 March 2010 at POL00054430.

12.4.1. Having considered the above documents, | do not recall when |
first became aware that Seema Misra’s Defence team were
applying to stay count 1 (theft) for abuse. | believe Mr Singh told
me of the application in February or early March of 2010. | do not
recall whether | had a view concerning the application. | do not

believe that I provided any advice. Advice would have been given

Page 8 of 35
WITN04210200
WITN04210200

by Prosecuting Counsel. | do not recall what the Post Office’s
response to the application was other than to defend the
application to stay the proceedings. | understand from the
documents that the Defence application to stay the proceedings
failed.

13. 1 have considered the transcripts from the 11th and 18th October at
UKG100014994 and UKG100014845. The Defence renewed their application to
stay the proceedings before His Honour Judge Stewart on the first day of the trial
on 11th October 2010. His Honour Judge Stewart ordered that the trial should
proceed and any issue in relation to the Calendar Square branch could be
explored during the course of the trial. If it was felt that the consequence of the
trial was not and could not be fair then His Honour Judge Stewart would retain
the power to stay the proceedings. His Honour Judge Stewart expressed the view
that it was not appropriate at that stage to order a stay of the prosecution. On
18th October 2010 the Defence renewed their application to stay the proceedings
alleging that the trial had been unfair. As part of his deliberation His Honour Judge
Stewart considered that the issue could properly be dealt with as part of the trial
process which the jury could consider when deciding whether or not Mrs Misra
was guilty of theft. | believe that | was unaware of the applications referred to
above until | read the transcripts submitted with the Request. | was not present in
Court during the course of the trial and provided no advice. | understand from the
documents that Prosecuting Counsel argued that there should not be a stay to
the proceedings. At the end of the trial, Mrs Misra was convicted of the theft.

14.41. the transcript of submissions, closing speeches and the Judge’s

directions on 19 October 2010 at POL00065708.

In relation to those documents:

15.1. | do not know how Penny Thomas and Gareth Jenkins came to be
involved in these proceedings against Seema Misra. | believe that Gareth
Jenkins was identified as an expert on the Horizon IT system at the
inception of the computer system and had agreed to assist POL in
telation to its role when conducting private prosecutions. This was
probably in 1999 prior to myself becoming head of the CLT. | am not sure
when Penny Thomas commenced her role either before these
proceedings or in relation to these proceedings. | note the email
POL00053930 in which Dave King confirms that he is happy to speak to
Prosecuting Counsel and refers to witnesses needing to come from
“Fujitsu, Network and P&BA". | note from reading (FUJ00122670) a

Page 12 of 35
WITN04210200
WITN04210200

series of emails that Penny Thomas was a Security Analyst in Customer
Support. Her role appears to be to support Gareth Jenkins which included
preparation of draft witness statements. Any work that she undertook for
Mr Jenkins she logged against “prosecution support time”. The e-mails
show the Investigation Manager contacting Penny Thomas directly
regarding matters which appear to relate to Mr Jenkins’ evidence. Gareth
Jenkins describes himself as a “Distinguished Engineer and Applications
Architect. | understand from the documents that he was regarded as an
expert on the horizon IT system by POL. | understand from the
documents that the Investigation Manager will have requested evidence
from Mr Jenkins either directly or via Penny Thomas.

15.2. | understood that Gareth Jenkins was employed by Fujitsu and had a role
in engineering the Horizon IT system. | further understand that Fujitsu
owned the data that was to be relied upon in relation to the POL private
prosecutions. That data was looked at by Defence experts and | believe
that no objections were raised by Defence teams to Fujitsu employees or
specifically Mr Jenkins giving evidence. | also understand that no Judge
hearing Fujitsu employees or Mr Jenkins giving evidence where
deficiencies were alleged to emanate from the Horizon IT system
objected to their evidence being given. At the time of the prosecutions it
seemed appropriate to obtain the evidence from Fujitsu employees.

15.3. | did not give any instructions to Mr Jenkins. | do not know whether Mr
Singh or anyone else within the CLT gave Mr Jenkins any instructions in

the Seema Misra prosecution.

Page 13 of 35
WITN04210200
WITN04210200

15.4. | considered that Mr Jenkins was acting as an expert. | had a minimal
involvement in the Seema Misra prosecution and do not believe | had any
contact with Mr Jenkins. | do not know whether anyone else explained to
him the nature of his duty as an expert but believe that, when giving
evidence, he would have been questioned about his qualifications,
experience, and the basis for his opinions, making it clear to the Court
and all parties involved why he was qualified to provide expert evidence
in the case.

15.5. During the course of the Seema Misra case | was notified of three
instances where "bugs, errors or defects" were present in the Horizon IT
system. The first related to an occurrence in December 2007 impacting
on one office where there was a financial imbalance (email
FUJ00155400). A software correction was applied to resolve the problem
in November 2008. The second concerned duplication of records
occurring under the New Horizon System. Ms McFarlane obtained a
statement from Gareth Jenkins covering the issue (emails 30 June 2010
FUJ00122903). The third was passed to me by an email from Alan
Simpson (POL00028838). This issue concerned discrepancies affecting
40 branches and occurred when moving discrepancies into the local
suspense account.

15.6. | do not recall speaking to Mr Jenkins about the Seema Misra case or, in
particular, any views expressed by Mr Jenkins in relation to disclosure

being sought by the Defence in the Seema Misra case.

16. | understand from reading the documents UKG100014898, POL00055100,

Page 14 of 35
17.

18.

WITN04210200
WITN04210200

POL00055150 and POL00055146 that the Defence were requesting access to
the system in the Midlands where it appears there were live reproducible errors.
The Defence also requested access to operations at Chesterfield to understand
how reconciliation and transaction corrections were dealt with and access to the
system change requests, known error logs and new release documents to
understand what problems had been fixed. | do not recall this request, or anything
to do with the response from POL, but believe from the documents supplied that
the requests were refused and the Defence were asked if they wished to proceed
with the request to make a Section 8 application to the Court. | understand from
the documents supplied that Mr Singh sought advice from Prosecution Counsel

on this point.

| have considered POL00055410, POL00028838 and FUJ00122995. At the time
| did not consider the issues discussed in the correspondence had a relevance to
the Seema Misra case and, accordingly, did not consider these issues to be
disclosable material in the prosecution. | understood that the Seema Misra case
was prosecuted under the Horizon System implemented from 1999. The issues
raised here | believe related to the New Horizon system which was installed from
January to September 2010 and did not have any relevance to the initial system
which had now been re-implemented as New Horizon (HNG-X). | now believe
that this was the wrong decision and that | should have disclosed this issue in

relation to all existing prosecutions.

| cannot recall what my view of the outcome of the case was at the time. | had
had very little input into the case but was aware of it and imagine that | was

content that a conviction had been achieved as the jury had determined the guilt
Page 15 of 35
WITN04210200
WITN04210200

of Mrs Misra. There were a number of individuals that the email of 21 October
was copied to who | did not know and | was surprised at the audience. | do not
believe that | was aware of the interest in the case and would not have expected
to see a report of this nature. The usual report would have simply described the
outcome and have been copied to a more limited audience. | did not share Jarnail
Singh’s hope that this would set a marker and believed that challenges to the
Horizon system would continue under New Horizon (HNG-X).

19. In so far as my reflections on the Seema Misra case are concerned, | was
shocked at the Judgement. | believed that the Horizon data was reliable and had
been properly disclosed. | understood that POL had dealt with its duties so far as
disclosure was concerned and ultimately seeking an order from the Judge dealing
with the prosecution when there was a challenge to the disclosure requests. |
believed that disclosure had been fully complied with. Clearly this view was not

correct.

The Prosecution of Alison Henderson

20. | must apologise to Mrs Alison Henderson as | have no recollection of her criminal
prosecution. My account is limited to the documents disclosed by the Inquiry and
any memories that they have engendered. Please note below a full account of

my dealings and recollection of the criminal prosecution of Alison Henderson.

| believe that | first became involved in the Alison Henderson case when |
allocated the case to myself shortly after receiving the papers in March 2010 but
cannot recall doing so.

Page 18 of 35
WITN04210200
WITN04210200

23. | believe | will have received a copy of the Investigation Report and copy of the
Interview transcript conducted with Mrs Henderson. | may have received a copy
of the branch trading statement (POL00047227) and the transaction report

(POL00047183) but cannot recall this or the extent of the case papers.

24. | do not recall what advice | gave to the Security Team. | understand from the
documents copied to me that | asked for further clarification of assertions made
in the Investigation Report (memo 25th March 2010 POL00047155), receiving a
reply on 20th April 2010 (POL00044501) with a further memo being sent on 21

May 2010 (POL00047159).

25. Whilst | do not recall the advice, | believe that | would have asked for evidence
covering the audit of the Sub-Post Office, the interviews conducted with Mrs
Henderson, production of the branch trading statements, and transactional data

from the Horizon IT system.

26. The reasoning behind the advice would be to adduce sufficient evidence to

provide a reasonable prospect of conviction.

27. | believe that Mr Andy Hayward the DAM authorised the Prosecution of Mrs

Henderson on 26.05.2010 (POL00047161).

28. | drafted the single charge of theft and Mr Hayward made the decision to charge
Mrs Henderson.

29. The charge of Theft was laid on 12 August 2010 (POL00047193). The charge
specified:

“FOR THAT YOU Alison Henderson on a day unknown between 2nd July 1997

Page 19 of 35
WITN04210200
WITN04210200

and 10th February 2010 at the Worstead Sub-Post Office stole £11957.78

belonging to Post Office Ltd. Contrary to S1 of the Theft Act 1968."

My memo of 21 May 2010 expressed the view that a single charge of theft was
the appropriate charge in this case against Mrs Henderson (POL00047159). |
have seen an email | wrote to Prosecuting Counsel (POL00055783) in which |
state that the Defence had indicated that Mrs Henderson may be willing to plead
to a charge of false accounting and pay the money back to PO Ltd. My email
goes on to say that “the matter is in defence counsel's hands”. | did not put any
pressure on anyone in the Defence team to offer a plea to false accounting or
suggest the same to anyone. | recall following a review of the documents that |
was expecting a trial in this prosecution. A letter was received from the Defence
solicitors dated 16th November 2010 enclosing an amended Defence Statement
(POL00055787 and POL00044503). The letter requested that the Defence would
require a further named witness to attend the trial of the matter. The Defence
Statement indicated that a "Goodyear" indication would be sought and whilst
denying theft, the Defendant would plead guilty to false accounting. | understand
that when the matter was next listed in Court which | believe was on ‘1st
December 2010 a count of false accounting was added to the Indictment. A
Goodyear indication was sought from the Judge however, he declined to give an
indication to allow the Defendant time to repay monies to POL. No pleas were
taken and the case was adjourned until 15th December 2010. | understand from
the documents that, at the hearing on 15th December, a plea to false accounting
was entered and the prosecution offered no evidence in relation to the charge of
theft. The Judge dismissed the charge of theft.

The disclosure officer was Christopher Knight.

My role in relation to disclosure in this case was to provide the Defence with initial
disclosure. This would include any unused evidence and any evidence that
undermined the prosecution case or assisted the Defence case. My duty of
disclosure would have continued throughout the course of the prosecution.
Following the receipt of the Defence Case Statement, in order to ensure
compliance with disclosure obligations | would first consider the statement and,
where any clarification of the content was required, | would write to the Defence
for clarification. | do note that a Defence statement was received in this case
where | questioned paragraph 2 which specified that further investigation by the
auditor could have discovered the whereabouts of the missing money

(POL00047168).

| believe after having reviewed the documents that the first time | became aware
that the integrity of the Horizon data was being questioned was upon receipt of
the amended Defence statement dated 16 November 2010. On the same date, |
received an indication that Mrs Henderson was highly likely to plead to false
accounting (POL00055783). The receipt ‘of the challenge complaining of the
malfunction of Horizon would have raised an obligation to serve on the Defence

any material that assisted the Defence or undermined the prosecution.

| do not believe that ARQ data was ever sought in this case. | understand that the
Sub-Post Office was situated in a village and had limited opening hours. Mrs
Henderson was the only person working at the office. She said that she did all of

the end of day work and branch trading statements herself. Further, she could

Page 21 of 35
35.

36.

WITN04210200
WITN04210200

not recall problems with balancing and that the shortage discovered by the
auditors was a complete shock (POL00129785). As set out above, the Defence
on 16 November indicated that Mrs Henderson was highly likely to plead to false
accounting (POL00055783). This was the same date that the amended Defence
Statement was received (POL00044503). At that stage ARQ had not been sought
and advice from Prosecution Counsel had not requested ARQ data
(POL00055542). Had Mrs Henderson decided to continue to contest the
allegation of theft and had false accounting not been added to the indictment,

then | believe ARQ data would have been considered.

| understand from the documents that following Prosecuting Counsel's advice
dated 14th October 2010 (POL00055542), that daily cash figures and overnight
cash holdings (ONCH) would be obtained. | understand from the documents that
the information Counsel required together with the cash declarations would make

it obvious that money was missing.

The Defence Statement was served on 16 November 2010 which was the same
date that | wrote to Prosecuting Counsel informing her that the Defence had
indicated that Mrs Henderson was highly likely to plead to false accounting. | have
seen the emails dated 8 October 2010 at POL00055410 and documents at
POL00028838, as well as the email from Juliet McFarlane dated 16th September
2010 FUJ00122995 and can only believe that | had forgotten about the generic
statement that had been prepared for Ms McFarlane. So far as the bugs raised
in the emails referred to above, | believe they related to the New Horizon system
which was installed from January to September 2010 and did not have any

relevance to the initial Horizon system which had now been re-implemented as
Page 22 of 35
37.

38.

WITN04210200
WITN04210200

New Horizon (HNG-X). As set out above, | now believe that this was the wrong
decision and | should have disclosed any issue concerning the New Horizon in

relation to the prosecution of Mrs Henderson.

| recall following a review of the documents that | was expecting a trial in relation
to the charge of Theft. | did not enter any negotiations with the Defence Solicitors.
So far as my stipulations in relation to the integrity of Horizon were concerned,
my view at the time in relation to the acceptance of the plea to false accounting
was that paragraph 10.4 of the Code for Crown Prosecutors 2010 applied to the
situation. Under paragraph 10.4 “Accepting Pleas” the code stated that:

“It must be made clear to the court on what basis any plea is advanced and
accepted. In cases where a defendant pleads guilty to the charges but on a basis
of facts that are different from the prosecution case, and where this may
significantly affect sentence, the court should be invited to hear evidence to

determine what happened, and then sentence on that basis”.

So far as my reflections on the way the investigation and prosecution of Alison
Henderson are concerned, | was of course shocked to read the criticism of the
conduct of the case. Whilst respecting the Judgement of the Court of Appeal in
Josephine Hamilton & Others v Post Office Limited (POL00113278), as set out
above, my view at the time and on reflection in relation to the acceptance of the
plea to false accounting was that paragraph 10.4 of the Code for Crown
Prosecutors 2010 applied to the situation. Under paragraph 10.4 “Accepting
Pleas’ it stated that “/t must be made clear to the court on what basis any plea is
advanced and accepted. In cases where a defendant pleads guilty to the charges

but on a basis of facts that are different from the prosecution case, and where
Page 23 of 35
WITN04210200
WITN04210200

this may significantly affect sentence, the court should be invited to hear evidence
to determine what happened, and then sentence on that basis.” | did not consider
that | was acting improperly at the time as to accept a basis of plea that blamed
any deficit on the Horizon IT system was agreeing with the Defence that Horizon
was not working properly. This was not how | understood the position. | believed

that the Horizon IT system was working properly.

September 2011.

| provided advice dated 11 October 2011 (POL00057078) which requested the
obtaining of Horizon data to show a number of reversals relating to sales of
stamps and records in relation to a “relief who may have worked at the Sub-Post

Office at the time of the reversals.

My advice was given in order to establish who was making the reversals. | wanted
to know what user login was recorded in relation to the transactions that were

reversed and whether or not there was a “relief working at the Sub-Post Office.

| did not apply any test when advising the Security Team. | did not provide the
final advice or draft charges in this case. The advice and draft charge were
prepared by Martin Smith of Messrs Cartwright King on 23rd March 2012
(POL00057543). | believe that the case papers had been transferred to Messrs
Cartwright King in anticipation of the split between Royal Mail Group and POL. |
refer to paragraphs 24-26, 35 and 41 of my first witness statement in relation to

the role of Messrs Cartwright King.

| understand from the Investigation Report dated 13 May 2011 (POL00046224)
that David Pardoe, Senior Security Manager authorised the prosecution of

Khayyam Ishaq.

The charge was drafted by Martin Smith of Messrs Cartwright King.

The charge was theft of £21,168.64 contrary to Section 1(1) of the Theft Act 1968.
The disclosure officer was Stephen Bradshaw.

| did not have a role in relation to disclosure in this case.

| was not aware that Mr Ishaq had raised issues relating to the integrity of the

Horizon data during the course of the prosecution.

| had no involvement in the prosecution after | moved to the Royal Mail Group in

April 2012.

My reflections in relation to the investigation and prosecution of Mr Ishaq now are
limited on the basis that | ceased to be involved with the case prior to the issue
of summonses. | had however sought to clarify issues concerning a number of
reversals relating to sales of stamps and records in relation to a "relief" who may
have worked at the Sub-Post Office prior to handing the file to POL to prosecute.
| note that in the Judgement of the Court of Appeal the evidence fell short of that
required to prove an actual loss and in such circumstances | am surprised to see

that Mr Ishaq on the 7th of March 2013 pleaded guilty to the theft of £17863.

Statement of Truth

| believe the content of this statement to be true.
