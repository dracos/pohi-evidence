                        .:.




This witness statement is made to assist the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry (the

"Inquiry") with the matters set out in the Rule 9 Request dated 19th October 2023 (the

"Request"). The statement, my second made in the Inquiry, covers action taken by

Post Office Ltd ("POI_") against Subpostmasters. My first witness statement, dated 11

May 2023, was made in response to a Rule 9 Request dated 14 April 2023. I repeat

the contents of that statement to the extent that they are relevant to the most recent

Request.


The Prosecution of Seema Misra




     Mr Jarnail Singh to deal with the prosecution. I make the following comments:


     1.1.    I recall that Mr Warwick Tatford was instructed as Counsel by Mr Singh



             involvement was restricted to a letter I wrote to Miss Issy Hogg, Mrs
                                     Page 1 of 35
                                                                                 WITN04210200
                                                                               WITNO4210200




       delayed until his return but I cannot say for certain. Mr Singh may have

       sought my advice from time to time but I cannot recall any specific

       instance or advice provided. I can see that an attendance note written

       by Mr Singh refers to myself being asked about a refusal by Fujitsu to

       allow Gareth Jenkins to meet the Defence expert_ My advice appears to

       be that someone would need to attend Court from Fujitsu to explain why

       authority for the experts to meet was not given but I cannot recall this.

       The authority for the experts to meet was granted shortly after the Fujitsu

       representative received this message (POLO0054999). I do recall that

       issues concerning disclosure were referred to the Judge dealing with the

       prosecution of Seema Misra but was not involved in these proceedings.


1.2;   As the Criminal Team Leader ("CTL") I was responsible for all of the

       prosecutions conducted by POL which included Royal Mail and

       Parcelforce prosecutions. I was also responsible for advising the

       Business and dealing with POL's relationships with external bodies such

       as the Courts. I managed my team, agents and Counsel. I estimate that

       the time I had to spend on POL work was probably less than 15% of my

       working time. I did not have a great deal of involvement in other lawyers'

       cases albeit if there was an issue on any prosecution or any member of
                                                                                    WITNO4210200

7,   As set out above, my role in relation to disclosure in these proceedings was

     restricted to writing a letter to Miss Issy Hogg dated 15.09.2010 and serving a

     schedule of non-sensitive unused material (POL00055236). I also served a disc

     containing Horizon data on Miss Izzy Hogg dated 05.03.2010 (P0L00054303).

      10.22. the emails dated 6 and 8 October 2010 at POL00055421.


11.   In relation to those documents

      11.1.   1 do not recall my view of the Defence requests in December 2009

              (POL00053723). I appear to have simply forwarded the email to Mr Singh

              who was dealing with the prosecution. My view on any issue of disclosure

              however would have been that if POL could comply with the requests and

              assist the Defence then such action should be taken.

      11.2.   1 do not recall providing any advice on the merits of disclosure requests

              made by the Defence at this or any stage of the prosecution.
                                                                                 WITN04210200
                                                                               WITNO4210200




11.3.    Counsel provided advice in January 2010. 1 do not recall the advice which

        would have been sent to Mr Singh.

11.4.    1 do not recall what the reaction was by POL to Counsel's Advice. I note

         paragraph 23 of Counsel's Advice and also note Juliet McFarlane's

        concern. I do not remember either Ms McFarlane or Mr Singh raising

        these matters with me but, had they done so, I would have asked them

        to liaise with Mr Tatford Prosecuting Counsel.

11.5.    I note from the attendance note (POL00053849) that reference is made

        to Prosecuting Counsel being the only person who could comment on

        "case papers" which I assume was a reference to the prosecution papers

        concerning Mr Hosi but cannot be sure. I do not recall this case. I

        understand that Counsel was able to see the case papers as the

        instructing solicitor was Ms McFarlane and she had instructed Counsel

        working in the same chambers as Mr Tatford.

11.6.   I do not recall whether Counsel advised after January 2010 or the nature

        of any advice.

11.7.   I have no recollection of Defence disclosure requests in so far as they

        related to the Horizon IT system. I understand from the document that

        Prosecuting Counsel was referred to in the attendance note dated 27

        January 2010 (POL00053849) where he was recorded as saying that:

        °°   we should disclose everything we can disclose at this stage so the

        defence will know where we are coming from. We should be seen to be

        willing"

I believe the PO endeavoured to heed this advice.
                                                                                          WITNO4210200
                                                                                     WITNO4210200




     11.8.   Each morning I received the post and allocated it to the relevant members

             of my team. Accordingly, as I dealt with this disclosure, I assume that Mr

             Singh was absent from the office at the time. In order to deal with the

             schedule of non-sensitive material I will have had to retrieve the case

             papers, check the previous disclosure schedule of non-sensitive material

             and then dictate the letter informing the Defence that the additions to the

             schedule commenced at entry number 19. In addition, had there been

             copy documents I would have copied them before sending to the Defence

             Solicitors. I believe I will have reviewed the papers to understand whether

             the P0's obligations had been complied with but cannot recall doing so.

             Had I any concerns I would have raised them with Mr Singh or

             Prosecuting Counsel.

12. 1 have considered:

    12.1.    the email from Issy Hogg dated 1 March 2010 at POL00054248;

    12.2.    the notification of fixture dated 2 March 2010 at POL00054275;

    12.3.    the email from Warwick Tatford dated 8 March 2010 and draft skeleton

             argument at POL00054335 and POL00054346; and

    12.4.    the emails dated 11 and 16 March 2010 at POL00054430.

             12.4.1. Having considered the above documents, I do not recall when I

                    first became aware that Seema Misra's Defence team were

                    applying to stay count 1 (theft) for abuse. I believe Mr Singh told

                    me of the application in February or early March of 2010. I do not

                    recall whether I had a view concerning the application. I do not

                    believe that I provided any advice. Advice would have been given
                                                                                           WITNO4210200
                                                                                         WITNO4210200




                     by Prosecuting Counsel . I do not recall what the Post Office's

                     response to the application was other than to defend the

                     application to stay the proceedings. I understand from the

                     documents that the Defence application to stay the proceedings

                     failed.

13. 1 have considered the transcripts from the 11th and 18th October at

    11KG100014994 and UKG100014845. The Defence renewed their application to

    stay the proceedings before His Honour Judge Stewart on the first day of the trial

    on 11th October 2010. His Honour Judge Stewart ordered that the trial should

    proceed and any issue in relation to the Calendar Square branch could be

    explored during the course of the trial. If it was felt that the consequence of the

    trial was not and could not be fair then His Honour Judge Stewart would retain

    the power to stay the proceedings. His Honour Judge Stewart expressed the view

    that it was not appropriate at that stage to order a stay of the prosecution. On

    18th October 2010 the Defence renewed their application to stay the proceedings

    alleging that the trial had been unfair. As part of his deliberation His Honour Judge

    Stewart considered that the issue could properly be dealt with as           of the trial
                                                                         part




    process which the jury could consider when deciding whether or not Mrs Misra

    was guilty of theft. I believe that I was unaware of the applications referred to

   above until I read the transcripts submitted with the Request. I was not present in

    Court during the course of the trial and provided no advice. I understand from the

   documents that Prosecuting Counsel argued that there should not be a stay to

   the proceedings. At the end of the trial, Mrs Misra was convicted of the theft.

      14.39. the Joint Statement to the Court by Gareth Jenkins and Charles

              McLachlan dated 11 October 2010 at POL00001882;

      14.40. the transcripts of 11, 14, 15 and 18 October 2010 at UKG100014994,

              directions on 19 October 2010 at P0L00065708.


15.   In relation to those documents:

      15.1.   1 do not know how Penny Thomas and Gareth Jenkins came to be

              involved in these proceedings against Seema Misra. I believe that Gareth

              Jenkins was identified as an expert on the Horizon IT system at the

              inception of the computer system and had agreed to assist POL in

              relation to its role when conducting private prosecutions. This was

              probably in 1999 prior to myself becoming head of the CLT. I am not sure

              when Penny Thomas commenced her role either before these

              proceedings or in relation to these proceedings. I note the email

              POL00053930 in which Dave King confirms that he is happy to speak to

              Prosecuting Counsel and refers to witnesses needing to come from

              "Fujitsu, Network and P&BA". I note from reading (FUJ00122670) a
                                                                                     WITNO4210200
                                                                               WITN04210200




        series of emails that Penny Thomas was a Security Analyst in Customer

        Support. Her role appears to be to support Gareth Jenkins which included

         preparation of draft witness statements. Any work that she undertook for

        Mr Jenkins she logged against "prosecution support time". The e-mails

        show the Investigation Manager contacting Penny Thomas directly

        regarding matters which appear to relate to Mr Jenkins evidence, Gareth

        Jenkins describes himself as a "Distinguished Engineer and Applications

        Architect. I understand from the documents that he was regarded as an

        expert on the horizon IT system by POL. I understand from the

        documents that the Investigation Manager will have requested evidence

        from Mr Jenkins either directly or via Penny Thomas.

15.2.   1 understood that Gareth Jenkins was employed by Fujitsu and had a role

        in engineering the Horizon IT system. I further understand that Fujitsu

        owned the data that was to be relied upon in relation to the POL private

        prosecutions. That data was looked at by Defence experts and I believe

        that no objections were raised by Defence teams to Fujitsu employees or

        specifically Mr Jenkins giving evidence. I also understand that no Judge

        hearing Fujitsu employees or Mr Jenkins giving evidence where

        deficiencies were alleged to emanate from the Horizon IT system

        objected to their evidence being given. At the time of the prosecutions it

        seemed appropriate to obtain the evidence from Fujitsu employees.

15.3.   I did not give any instructions to Mr Jenkins. I do not know whether Mr

        Singh or anyone else within the CLT gave Mr Jenkins any instructions in

        the Seema Misra prosecution.
                                                                                   WITN04210200
                                                                             WITNO4210200




15.4.   1 considered that Mr Jenkins was acting as an expert. I had a minimal

        involvement in the Seema Misra prosecution and do not believe I had any

        contact with Mr Jenkins. I do not know whether anyone else explained to

        him the nature of his duty as an expert but believe that, when giving

        evidence, he would have been questioned about his qualifications,

        experience, and the basis for his opinions, making it clear to the Court

        and all parties involved why he was qualified to provide expert evidence

        in the case.

15.5.   During the course of the Seema Misra case I was notified of three

        instances where 'bugs, errors or defects" were present in the Horizon IT

        system. The first related to an occurrence in December 2007 impacting

        on one office where there was a financial imbalance (email

        FUJ00155400). A software correction was applied to resolve the problem

        in November 2008. The second concerned duplication of records

        occurring under the New Horizon System. Ms McFarlane obtained a

        statement from Gareth Jenkins covering the issue (emails 30 June 2010

        FUJ00122903). The third was passed to me by an email from Alan

        Simpson (POL00028838). This issue concerned discrepancies affecting

        40 branches and occurred when moving discrepancies into the local

        suspense account.

15.6.   I do not recall speaking to Mr Jenkins about the Seema Misra case or, in

        particular, any views expressed by Mr Jenkins in relation to disclosure

        being sought by the Defence in the Seema Misra case.

                                                                                     WITNO4210200




      system change requests, known error logs and new release documents to

      understand what problems had been fixed. I do not recall this request, or anything

      to do with the response from POL, but believe from the documents supplied that

      the requests were refused and the Defence were asked if they wished to proceed

      with the request to make a Section 8 application to the Court. I understand from

      the documents supplied that Mr Singh sought advice from Prosecution Counsel

      on this point.


17.   I have considered POL000 5410, POL00028838 and FUJ0012299 . At the time

      I did not consider the issues discussed in the correspondence had a relevance to

      the Seema Misra case and, accordingly, did not consider these issues to be

      disclosable material in the prosecution. I understood that the Seema Misra case

      was prosecuted under the Horizon System implemented from 1999. The issues

      raised here I believe related to the New Horizon system which was installed from

      January to September 2010 and did not have any relevance to the initial system

      which had now been re-implemented as New Horizon (IINC.X). I now believe

      that this was the wrong decision and that I should have disclosed this issue in

      relation to all existing prosecutions.


18.   I cannot recall what my view of the outcome of the case was at the time. I had

      had very little input into the case but was aware of it and imagine that I was

      content that a conviction had been achieved as the jury had determined the guilt

                                                                                   WITN04210200




     believe that I was aware of the interest in the case and would not have expected




    Horizon system would continue under New Horizon (HNG-X).

19. In so far as my reflections on the Seema Misra case are concerned, I was

    shocked at the Judgement. I believed that the Horizon data was reliable and had

    been properly disclosed. I understood that POL had dealt with its duties so far as

    disclosure was concerned and ultimately seeking an order from the Judge dealing

    with the prosecution when there was a challenge to the disclosure requests. I

    believed that disclosure had been fully complied with. Clearly this view was not

    correct.

30. My memo of 21 May 2010 expressed the view that a single charge of theft was

    the appropriate charge in this case against Mrs Henderson (POL00047159). I

     have seen an email I wrote to Prosecuting Counsel (POL00055783) in which I

    state that the Defence had indicated that Mrs Henderson may be willing to plead

    to a charge of false accounting and pay the money back to PO Ltd. My email

    goes onto say that "the matter is in defence counsel's hands". I did not put any

    pressure on anyone in the Defence team to offer a plea to false accounting or

    suggest the same to anyone. I recall following a review of the documents that I

    was expecting a trial in this prosecution. A letter was received from the Defence

    solicitors dated 16th November 2010 enclosing an amended Defence Statement

    (POL000557 7 and POL00044503). The letter requested that the Defence would

    require a further named witness to attend the trial of the matter. The Defence

    Statement indicated that a "Goodyear" indication would be sought and whilst

    denying theft, the Defendant would plead guilty to false accounting. I understand

    that when the matter was next listed in Court which I believe was on 1st

    December 2010 a count of false accounting was added to the Indictment. A

    Goodyear indication was sought from the Judge however, he declined to give an

    indication to allow the Defendant time to repay monies to POL. No pleas were

    taken and the case was adjourned until 15th December 2010. I understand from

    the documents that, at the hearing on 15th December, a plea to false accounting

    was entered and the prosecution offered no evidence in relation to the charge of

    theft. The Judge dismissed the charge of theft.
                                                                                         WITN04210200
                                                                                      WITNO4210200




32. My role in relation to disclosure in this case was to provide the Defence with initial

      disclosure. This would include any unused evidence and any evidence that

      undermined the prosecution case or assisted the Defence case. My duty of

      disclosure would have continued throughout the course of the prosecution.

      Following the receipt of the Defence Case Statement, in order to ensure

     compliance with disclosure obligations I would first consider the statement and,

     where any clarification of the content was required, I would write to the Defence

     for clarification. I do note that a Defence statement was received in this case

     where I questioned paragraph 2 which specified that further investigation by the

     auditor could have discovered the whereabouts of the missing money

     (POL00047168).


33. 1 believe after having reviewed the documents that the first time I became aware

     that the integrity of the Horizon data was being questioned was upon receipt of

     the amended Defence statement dated 16 November 2010. On the same date, I

     received an indication that Mrs Henderson was highly likely to plead to false

     accounting (POL00055783). The receipt of the challenge complaining of the

     malfunction of Horizon would have raised an obligation to serve on the Defence

     any material that assisted the Defence or undermined the prosecution.


34. 1 do not believe that ARQ data was ever sought in this case. I understand that the

     Sub-Post Office was situated in a village and had limited opening hours. Mrs

     Henderson was the only person working at the office. She said that she did all of

     the end of day work and branch trading statements herself. Further, she could
                                                                                        WITN04210200
                                                                                    WITNO4210200




     not recall problems with balancing and that the shortage discovered by the

     auditors was a complete shock (POL00129785). As set out above, the Defence

     on 16 November indicated that Mrs Henderson was highly likely to plead to false

     accounting (POL00055783). This was the same date that the amended Defence

     Statement was received (POL00044503). At that stage ARQ had not been sought

     and advice from Prosecution Counsel had             not requested ARQ data

     (POL00055542). Had Mrs Henderson decided to continue to contest the

     allegation of theft and had false accounting not been added to the indictment,

    then I believe ARQ data would have been considered.


35. 1 understand from the documents that following Prosecuting Counsel's advice

    dated 14th October 2010 (POL0055542), that daily cash figures and overnight

    cash holdings (ONCH) would be obtained. I understand from the documents that

    the information Counsel required together with the cash declarations would make

    it obvious that money was missing.


36. The Defence Statement was served on 16 November 2010 which was the same

    date that I wrote to Prosecuting Counsel informing her that the Defence had

    indicated that Mrs Henderson was highly likely to plead to false accounting. I have

    seen the emails dated 8 October 2010 at POL00055410 and documents at

    POL00028838, as well as the email from Juliet McFarlane dated 16th September

    2010 FUJ00122995 and can only believe that I had forgotten about the generic

    statement that had been prepared for Ms McFarlane. So far as the bugs raised

    in the emails referred to above, I believe they related to the New Horizon system

    which was installed from January to September 2010 and did not have any

    relevance to the initial Horizon system which had now been re-implemented as

      New Horizon (HNG-X). As set out above, I now believe that this was the wrong

     decision and I should have disclosed any issue concerning the New Horizon in

     relation to the prosecution of Mrs Henderson.


37. 1 recall following a review of the documents that I was expecting a trial in relation

     to the charge of Theft. I did not enter any negotiations with the Defence Solicitors.

     So far as my stipulations in relation to the integrity of Horizon were concerned,

     my view at the time in relation to the acceptance of the plea to false accounting

     was that paragraph 10.4 of the Code for Crown Prosecutors 2010 applied to the

     situation. Under paragraph 10.4 "Accepting Pleas" the code stated that:

     "It must be made clear to the court on what basis any plea is advanced and

     accepted. In cases where a defendant pleads guilty to the charges but on a basis

     of facts that are different from the prosecution case, and where this may

     significantly affect sentence, the court should be invited to hear evidence to

     determine what happened, and then sentence on that basis".


38. So far as my reflections on the way the investigation and prosecution of Alison

     Henderson are concerned, I was of course shocked to read the criticism of the

     conduct of the case. Whilst respecting the Judgement of the Court of Appeal in

     Josephine Hamilton & Others v Post Office Limited (POL00113278), as set out

     above, my view at the time and on reflection in relation to the acceptance of the

     plea to false accounting was that paragraph 10.4 of the Code for Crown

     Prosecutors 2010 applied to the situation. Under paragraph 10.4 `Accepting

     Pleas" it stated that "It must be made clear to the court on what basis any plea is

    advanced and accepted. In cases where a defendant pleads guilty to the charges

    but on a basis of facts that are different from the prosecution case, and where
                                                                                                       WITN04210200
                                                                                                     WITNO4210200




                    this may significantly affect sentence, the court should be invited to hear evidence

                    to determine what happened, and then sentence on that basis." I did not consider

                    that I was acting improperly at the time as to accept a basis of plea that blamed

                    any deficit on the Horizon IT system was agreeing with the Defence that Horizon

                    was not working properly. This was not how I understood the position. I believed

                    that the Horizon IT system was working properly.


The                              of Khayyarn Ishaq
      Prosecution




39.                 1 must apologise to Mr Khayyam Ishaq as I have no recollection of his criminal

                    prosecution. My account is limited to the documents disclosed by the Inquiry and

                    any memories that they have engendered.

40.                 1 have considered the following documents:

Investigation Report dated 13 May 2011 (POL00046224), copies of the taped

interviews of 7 April 2011 (POL00046340 and POL00045133), and possibly the

final advice or draft charges in this case. The advice and draft charge were

prepared by Martin Smith of Messrs Cartwright King on 23rd March 2012

(POL00057543). I believe that the case papers had been transferred to Messrs

Cartwright King in anticipation of the split between Royal Mail Group and POL. I

refer to paragraphs 24-26, 35 and 41 of my first witness statement in relation to

the role of Messrs Cartwright King.

51. 1 was not aware that Mr Ishaq had raised issues relating to the integrity of the

      Horizon data during the course of the prosecution.


52. 1 had no involvement in the prosecution after I moved to the Royal Mail Group in

     April 2012.


53. My reflections in relation to the investigation and prosecution of Mr Ishaq now are

      limited on the basis that I ceased to be involved with the case prior to the issue

     of summonses. I had however sought to clarify issues concerning a number of

     reversals relating to sales of stamps and records in relation to a "relief who may

     have worked at the Sub-Post Office prior to handing the file to POL to prosecute.

     I note that in the Judgement of the Court of Appeal the evidence fell short of that

     required to prove an actual loss and in such circumstances I am surprised to see

     that Mr Ishaq on the 7th of March 2013 pleaded guilty to the theft of £17863.
