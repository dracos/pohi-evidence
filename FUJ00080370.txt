POA Operations Incident Management Procedure

Fe)
FUJITSU

FUJITSU RESTRICTED (COMMERCIAL IN
CONFIDENCE)

1 Introduction

1.1 Owner

The owner of the Incident Management process at the local POA account level is the Fujitsu POA
Service Delivery Manager responsible for Incident Management within the POA account.

1.2 Objective

The objective of this document is to define the procedure for Incident Management in the POA
environment. The procedure is the local implementation of the Fujitsu corporate Incident Management
process (C-MSv1.3). Reference to process in this document is within the context of the corporate
document C-MSv1.3. For the purpose of this document an Incident is defined as:

“Any event which is not part of the standard operation of a service and which causes, or may cause, an
interruption to, or a reduction in, the quality of that service.”

The quality of the service includes the protection of the confidentiality of business, personal and card
data as defined by the POA Information Security Policy (SVM/SEC/POL/0003).

The document applies to all Incidents raised by the POA MAC or by SMC (out of hours or from systems
monitoring tools), where they are related to the Fujitsu outsourcing contract. N.B calls presented to POA
MAC / SMC that should be placed with the Atos Service Desk are transferred/ referred from POA MAC /
SMC to Atos Service Desk.

For clarity; Post Office Limited (the customer) appointed Atos as their Service Integrator including the
primary service desk function (Atos Service Desk, which may also be referred to as SISD).

The scope of the process is from the receipt of an incident by the MAC / SMC, through to the successful
workaround or resolution of the incident.

For clarity, it should be noted that the MAC team are responsible for managing/owning Incidents
between 08.00 and 20.00 Monday to Friday, 08.00 to 17.00 Saturday and Bank Holidays 0800 — 1400
excluding Christmas Day. The SMC assume this responsibility out of hours, i.e., outside these hours.
The SMC are responsible for escalation of incidents to the POA OOH Duty Manager.

The key objectives of the process are (C-MSv1.3)

Log, track and close all types of incident requests

Respond to all types of incident requests

Restore agreed service to the business as soon as possible

Resolve incidents within the target timescales set for each priority level within the Service Level
Agreement(s)

Resolve a high number of requests at first contact

Ensuring incident priorities are linked to business priorities

Keeping the user informed of progress

Reduced unplanned downtime

Improved Customer satisfaction

ee cee

1.3 Process Rationale

The primary goal of the Incident Management process is to restore normal service operation as quickly
as possible, thereby minimising adverse impact to the business. In turn, this ensures the highest level of

service quality and availability. Normal service operation is defined here as service operation within
Service Level Targets (SLT).

Demonstrating a professional approach to Atos, the Service Integrator contracted to POL, and Post
Office Limited (the customer) and their clients.

1.4 Mandatory Guidelines

It is important to maintain a balance between:
a) Allowing the technical teams the right amount of time to diagnose and impact an incident
b) Avoiding unnecessary alerting of the customer
c) Assessing which incidents are major

The following guidelines should be adhered to.

e During the MAC Core Hours (Monday — Friday 08:00 — 20:00 and Saturday 08:00 — 17:00 and
Bank Holidays 0800 - 1400 excluding Christmas Day.) the MAC should be the first point of
operational contact between Fujitsu and the Atos Service Desk. Outside these hours the SMC
acts as the first point of contact.

e Any activity detailed in this document which is assigned to the MAC is handed over to the SMC.
outside the MAC Core Hours.

2 ‘Inputs

The inputs to this process are:

e All Incidents reported by Contact with the MAC / SMC. Contact is defined as voice, e-mail, incident
transfers over the HDI interface from the Atos Service Desk or Tivoli Alert as the methods of
communication with the MAC / SMC and fall into the following categories:

°
°
°
°
°

°

Business process error

Hardware or software error

Request for information e.g. progress of a previously reported Incident
User complaint

Network Error

Logging via HNG-X web interface

e Severity and SLT information.

¢ Evidence of an Error.

e System Alerts received automatically from transaction monitoring tools. Due to the urgent nature of
some of these alerts, they may be dealt with directly by SSC, with an update of workaround or
resolution supplied to MAC / SMC. It should be noted that these alerts enter the process at step
1.2.3, and are not subject to prior steps in 1.1 & 1.2 of this process.

Risks and Dependencies

3.1 Risks

The following define the risks to the successful delivery of the process:

Break in the communications chain to third parties. Mitigation is to invoke escalation procedures.
Non-availability of the MAC / SMC Incident Management System. Mitigation is given in the MAC /
SMC Business Continuity Plan.

Non-availability of the HDI interface with the Atos Service Desk.

Non-availability of the OTI links to internal & external service desk tools.

Lack of information given to the MAC / SMC regarding changes, Atos or POL Business updates,
request for changes, status of Problems etc. Processes must be followed to lessen this risk, such as
the Change Management and Problem Management Processes.

Unavailability of sufficient support unit staff

Unavailability of sufficient tools for Incident diagnosis

Non-availability of KEL or call management systems

The provision of inadequate staff training within the MAC / SMC, SDU's or 3” party suppliers
Unavailability of systems for evidence gathering.

3.2 Dependencies

This process is dependent on:

Effective Incident handling by the MAC / SMC.
The known error information being available and kept up to date with all errors as the root cause
becomes known to Problem Management

« Knowledge database kept up to date with POL business and services knowledge

e Fujitsu infrastructure support of the MAC / SMC tools

« Appropriate training plans / skills transfer of desk agents.

« Appropriate training needs to include hardware, software and networks support staff, SDU's and 3°
party suppliers

« Effective routing of calls to SDUs and third parties

« Effective escalation procedures and the maintenance thereof within Fujitsu, POL and third parties

« Governance of Incident / Problem Management procedures

e Effective feedback to POL through Service Management SRFs, contributing to end user education
and reduced Incident rates.

e Internal feedback to improve the Incident / Management Process.

e SLT and OLA knowledge and understanding across all Fujitsu and 3” party support

* POA, SDU and 3” party consistent co-operation in incident identification and resolution

1.1.1 I Incident See specifics 112
Identification I An Incident is received through contact (see definition in under Activities
and Logging Section 2.0 above) with the MAC / SMC from:

Atos SD

Fujitsu SDUs

POA IT Service Management

Third Parties

Fujitsu Service Delivery Management

Post Office Ltd, including POL Information Security

For Ownership, Monitoring, Tracking and Communication
by the MAC/SMC/SSC see section 5.2.6 below

The caller may be enquiring about an existing Known Error
or Incident. Check the Knowledge Database for an existing
KEL which provides avoidance actions. For existing
incidents the details are provided and if the response is
satisfactory, contact is ended, moving the incident to step
4. If the caller is not satisfied with the response, the
relevant Escalation Procedure is invoked. In cases of
Incidents that are either taking an above average time (for
this type of Incident) to resolve or involve multiple SDU’s,
the MAC / SMC alerts the relevant Service Delivery
Manager to provide focused management of the Incident.

Outputs: Service desk complaints procedure invoked, an
existing incident updated or new incident validated

1.4.2 I Create MAC, SMC 113
Incident For a new Incident, Contact details are recorded if not
Record system generated, e.g., an Atos SD SDM12 incident.
Details taken are dependent upon the error reported.
Typically they may include:

The user's name and unique ID number

Location and contact details

Alternative contact details (where appropriate)

Hardware details as appropriate

Software error details, including application use at point of
failure where known

Business and User Impact

Description of Incident

Location access times

1.2

Quality — record details of complaint or compliment and
invoke the relevant Escalation Procedure.

Advice & Guidance — Cold Transfer to Atos SD.

Out of scope — if the call is not within scope for the services
provided by Fujitsu advise the caller of the correct number
or refer to Atos SD and close incident.

Set Priority of the incident either based on the priority
documented in an existing KEL or based upon the Urgency
and Impact of the incident, refer to POA Incident Enquiry
Matrix. (Re-assess the caller's assessment of the impact of
the incident, e.g., number of users affected and business
impact, and contact the POA Duty Manager if clarity is
required regarding the priority.)

Consider if the incident is out of scope, e.g., the incident
description indicates that a third party is responsible.

Consider if the incident being reported is a Security Incident
and classify and manage under the POA Operational
Security process (See Appendix A for guidance).

Consider if the incident is for chargeable work, e.g., file re-
sends. When applicable continue raising the incident and
advise the POA Duty Manager.

Ensure all third party references are detailed in the TfS
incident and it is clearly documented when the incident is
transferred to a third party for investigation.

If the incident is considered a Major Incident as defined in
SVM/SDM/PRO/0001 Major Incident Process, the Major
Incident Procedure is invoked inform the POA Duty
Manager.

Provide the caller with the incident reference.

Output: Prioritised and updated incident record

record ora

The MAC / SMC agent should check the TfS Incident and
problem database for current outstanding incidents or problems.
If a match is made, the caller is then advised of the status of
the incident or problem and the master record (parent incident
or problem record) is updated to reflect the current occurrence.

The MAC / SMC agent should then attempt to resolve the
Incident using the resources available. This starts by the MAC /
SMC interrogating the KEL knowledge database and support
documentation to find all information related to the Incident
symptoms. If the Incident is routine, i.e. there is a
predetermined route for resolution, then the Incident is resolved
on the call or referred to the relevant SDU using the MAC /
SMC Support Matrix.

Note: If a KEL recommends setting a priority of an incident at a
priority higher than that specified in the POA Incident Enquiry
Matrix then revise the incident to the higher priority.

Output: Updated incident with initial investigation findings or
input incident resolution detail (go to step 1.4)

122 I Refer to Refer the incident to Resolver Group MAC, SMC 123

eunpor Where there is no resolution to the Incident the MAC /SMC
transfer to agent should transfer the incident to the relevant Service Delivery
appropriate Unit (also known as Resolver Group) using the MAC / SMC

SDU Support Matrix. MAC are appraised of the position.

Note: When incidents are transferred to the Software Support
Centre (EDSC) the TfS incident is transferred into a Peak
incident system. Within Peak the incident priorities are defined
as A, B, C and D. Therefore, when transferring TfS incidents
into Peak ensure the following is adhered to:

TfS priority 1 equates to Peak priority A
TfS priority 2 equates to Peak priority B
TfS priority 3 equates to Peak priority C
TfS priorities 4 and 5 equates to Peak priority D

If it this cannot be achieved through automation the MAC or
SMC Agent undertaking the transfer is to log a comment on the
TFS incident stating the TfS and Peak priorities.

Output: Updated incident transferred to relevant Resolver

evidence

The referred SDU investigates and diagnoses the Incident,
based on information already taken by the MAC / SMC.

Consider if the incident should have been assigned to an
alternative SDU. If it is more appropriate for an alternative
SDU to investigate, ‘voice’ the team and then re-assign the
incident.

Consider if the appropriate Impact, Urgency and Priority has
been set for the incident (e.g., based on the fault and the SLTs.
for the affected service(s). Revise when necessary.

The SDU should review the analysis and re-consider if there are
any related incidents, problem or KEL knowledge entries.

Consideration should be given to any recent changes, e.g.,
Manage System Changes or Software Releases which could
either cause or contributed to the new incident.

Output: Updated incident (KELs/Changes, etc. considered) and
possible transfer to alternative Resolver Group

Conduct Extensive Analysis.

If the incident is deemed the same as an existing master
incident add it as a child incident and return incident to MAC /
SMC team. (return to step 1.2.1)

The referred SDU investigates and diagnoses the incident,
based on information already taken by the MAC / SMC,
together with any new information. The SDU also coordinates
where sub-contract third parties are involved. If the Incident has
no associated KEL, or it is complex and involves multiple
SDU's, or if it has been unresolved for an extended period, the
MAC will alert the POA Service Delivery Manager to the
existence of a pattern likely to produce a Problem.

Consider if there is sufficient evidence and it is of the correct
type for the incident to be investigated. If not detail the
required evidence so the incident can be returned to the
initiator.

Consider if the incident needs to be referred to a third party
vendor/supplier. If applicable ensure the Service Delivery
Manager responsible for the relationship with the third party
supplier is aware of the incident.

From the output of the analysis the SDU diagnoses the cause
and identifies a solution or workaround.

Output: Incident updated, further evidence requested, transfer
to third party or solution/workaround identified.

reviewed at a Business Impact Forum to review and agree if a
software fix is to be developed or the circumvention
implemented. If the BIF forum agrees that a formal fix is
required the Incident (Peak) is scheduled into a subsequent
Peak Target Forum so that an appropriate release is identified
for the change.

Individual releases are managed through a controlled
Integration, Live System Testing and release to live processes
via the Managed Service Change process.

9 Appendix A: Security Incident Reporting
9.1 Scope

This annex contains quidance regarding the reporting and investigation of security incidents concerning
the HORIZON Network, POA and any Payment Brand incident (PCI).

9.2 Aim

The aim of this guidance is to ensure that the reporting routes for Security Incidents are kept as simple
as possible and that investigations are managed in an efficient and auditable manner.

9.3 Changes

This guidance is primarily for use by the MAC team, the POA Security Team, the POL Security Team,
and SSC staff. The SecOps team also have their own work instructions for handling security incidents
and there is also an overarching Information Security Incident Management Procedure ISSC-11a.

All incident documentation is subject to review and update by the business continuity and information
security teams as part of the lessons learnt process following an incident and following the annual review
of the incident process as part of business continuity.

9.4 POL Incident Handling Guidance

All POL incidents will still be handled in accordance with existing POL/ATOS guidelines. This document
does not replace these or, indeed, replace any part of the content rather it details POA guidance on
handling security incidents.

9.5 IT Incidents
9.5.1 Incident Definition

9.5.1.1 An information security Incident is: "an adverse event or series of events that compromises
the confidentiality, integrity or availability of Fujitsu Services Post Office Account information or
information technology assets, having an adverse impact on Fujitsu Services and/or Post Office Ltd
reputation, brand, performance or ability to meet its regulatory or legal obligations." This will also extend
to include assets entrusted to Fujitsu including data belonging to Post Office Ltd, its clients and its
customers.

9.5.2 Incident Categories

Incidents can be categorised in many ways, they can occur alone or in combination with other incident
categories and can vary significantly in severity and impact. It is important that all incidents are
recognised and acted upon.

POA Operations Incident Management Procedure

FUJITSU RESTRICTED (COMMERCIAL IN
CONFIDENCE)

9.5.2.1 For the purpose of illustrating the impact of incidents two levels of severity have been
defined (Note: in practice the assessment may be less straightforward):

A MINOR incident will normally have limited and localised impact and be confined to one domain,
resulting in one or more of the following:

Loss or unauthorised disclosure of internal or sensitive material leading to minor
exposure, or minor damage of reputation

Loss of integrity within the system application or data, leading minimal damage of
reputation; minimal loss of customer / supplier / stakeholder confidence; negligible cost
of recovery

Loss of service availability within the domain, leading to reduced ability to conduct
business as usual; negligible loss of revenue; minimal loss of customer / supplier /
stakeholder confidence; negligible cost of recovery

Individual attempts to breach network security controls shall be treated as a minor
security breach.

Subject to discussions with the POA Duty manager due to high volume of calls relating
to the same type of incident it may well be a requirement to follow the POA Major
Incident Process (SVM/SDM/PRO/0001) following the advice from the POA Duty
Manager.

A MAJOR incident will have a significant impact on the Network Banking Automation Community
resulting in one of more of the following:

Loss or unauthorised disclosure of confidential or strictly confidential material, leading to
brand or reputation damage; legal action by employees, clients, customers, partners or
other external parties

Loss of integrity of the applications or data, leading to brand or reputation damage; loss
of customer / supplier / client confidence; cost of recovery

Loss of service availability for applications or communications networks, leading to an
inability to conduct business as usual; loss of revenue; loss of customer / supplier / client
confidence; cost of recovery

Aconcerted attempt or a successful breach of network security controls shall be treated
as a major security breach.

NB. For a Major Incident the POA Major Incident Process (SVM/SDM/PRO/0001) should be followed.

9.5.3 Examples of IT Incidents

Theft of IT equipment / property, including software
Malicious damage to IT equipment /property, including software
Theft or loss of Protectively Marked, caveat or sensitive IT Data.

Actual or suspected attacks on the Fujitsu Services POA Network or Information
System.

Potential compromise of systems or services at the Data Centre through evidence
retrieved and presented by Police or POL's card acquirer.

9.5.4 Containment

Whenever an Incident is identified which presents a serious threat to conduct normal business it should
be contained and isolated as quickly as possible. This will mean platforms that appear to have suffered
virus attack or other malicious code attack need to be quarantined immediately to prevent further
spread. It may also be necessary to isolate network connections that appear to be the source for Denial
of Service threats or where they have been subjected to suspected hacking attack.

If the incident relates to card data, the environment may be subject to a Forensic Investigation imposed
by POL's merchant acquirer. In this instance log data will need to be reviewed and analysed.

9.6 Reporting

Whenever a security incident is identified which presents a serious threat to conducting normal business
it is contained and isolated as quickly as possible.

A security Incident is first notified to either the MAC or SMC Team, then transferred to the SecOPs call
stack, once it is initially assessed as a Security Incident by MAC/SMC.

Security Incidents may also be reported directly into the POA SecOps team via the reporting button on
the POA Portal. It is important to allow the 2 reporting methods, as some staff may want to report some
types of security incidents directly to the SecOps team. In accordance with the Fujitsu Security Policy
Manual Section 16, the reporting routes must be kept as simple as possible. The initial report will be
validated and clarified by SecOps, with calls made to the initiator if more information is required.
SecOps will follow team work instructions to progress their investigation.

FUJITSU RESTRICTED (COMMERCIAL IN
CONFIDENCE)

All Security Incidents are to be reported to the SecOps team via a dedicated mailbox and escalated by
phone if necessary. Depending on the type of Incident and the severity of the incident, POA Security
makes the decision to escalate details to the POL/ATOS Security teams. In the case of Data Centre
incidents, POA Security also informs the Data Centre.

Regardless of the severity of the incident, when a compromise in card data occurs, the incident is
reported to POL Security so that POL can comply with its contractual obligations with its card acquirer.

The investigation of a reported incident is carried out by a nominated investigator from the POA SecOps
team. ATOS and POL Security Teams will be on hand to provide support as required and in accordance
with the POL/ATOS Information Security Incident Management Procedure. The investigator will obtain
as much original evidence as possible to ensure that is admissible in court, if required.

Following the initial investigation and where considered appropriate, the appropriate senior manager
within POL liaises with the local Police or other external agencies.

When an investigation is closed the POA Security Manager seeks to ensure that details of the
investigation have been recorded and can be made available for Route Cause Analysis, trending &
lessons learned.

9.7 Investigation

9.7.1 Policy

Although all security incidents will initially be reported to the POA Security Manager in order to have one
point of contact for all parties, some or all of the investigation requirements may be passed to one or
more of the following for further action. The decision of delegation will be determined by the POA
Security Manager in association with POL Information Security Incident Manager.

9.7.2 POL Security / Investigation Team

9.7.2.1 In the event that the reporting of an incident is passed to ATOS Security or the Investigation
Team, details of the investigation, and final outcome or reference details, should be added to the TfS.
call which be communicated to ATOS. It is important that for any incident investigated the correct
procedures are adopted regarding evidence, as the information collected and recorded may be used for
evidential purposes at a later date.

9.7.2.2 In the event that the POA Security Team takes ownership of an investigation, they will report
the results to ATOS.

9.7.2.3 During any investigation the Investigator must comply with the appropriate legislation and
compliance requirements and regulatory or standard requirements.

POA Operations Incident Management Procedure

FUJITSU

FUJITSU RESTRICTED (COMMERCIAL IN
CONFIDENCE)

9.7.2.1.1 All initial investigations should be carried out at the earliest opportunity and any queries
should be directed to POA Security Manager. Investigation must be reliable, stand up to scrutiny and
potential cross-examination and evidence must be properly obtained, recorded and time stamped.

9.7.3 External Investigator

9.7.3.1. Should it be considered necessary the incident might be passed to an external Investigator
or forensics team, who will ensure that any data required for evidential purposes is captured and
investigated using a systematic approach which ensures that an auditable record of evidence is
maintained and can be retrieved. In some cases, where a compromise to card data is involved, two
Forensic Investigation teams may be involved. One team operating on behalf of POL gathering the
required audit logs to use to analyse and investigate the problem. A second Forensic Investigations team
may be imposed to investigate on behalf of the card acquirer and card schemes. In all incidences where
a Forensic Investigation is involved, the Forensic Investigators will be shadowed by POL's Legal and
Security Teams.

9.7.4 Evidence Rules

9.7.4.1 Rules of Evidence

Before undertaking security incident investigation and computer forensics it is essential that investigators
have a thorough understanding of the Rules of Evidence. The submission of evidence in any type of
legal proceedings generally amounts to a significant challenge, but when computers are involved the
problems are intensified. Special knowledge is needed to locate and collect evidence, and special care is
required to preserve and transport evidence. Evidence in computer crime cases differs from traditional
forms of evidence in as much as most computer related evidence is intangible and is in the form of
electronic pulse or magnetic charge, hence the need to use specialist teams. That said the information
collected and recorded from the Operational areas is equally important and must be recorded with due
care and diligence.

9.7.4.2 Types of Evidence

Many types of evidence can be offered in court to prove the truth or falsity of a given fact.
The most common forms of evidence are Direct, Real, Documentary and Demonstrative.
Direct Evidence

Direct evidence is oral testimony whereby the knowledge is obtained from any of the witness's five
senses and is in itself proof or disproof of a fact in issue. Direct evidence is called to prove a specific act
such as an eye witness statement.

Real Evidence

Real evidence also known as associative or physical evidence is made up of tangible evidence that
proves or disproves guilt. Physical evidence includes such things as tools used in the crime, and
perishable evidence capable of reproduction etc. The purpose of physical evidence is to link the suspect
to the scene of the crime. It is that evidence that has material existence and can be presented to the
view of the court and jury for consideration.

Documentary Evidence

Documentary evidence is presented to the court in forms of business records, manuals, printouts etc.
Much of the evidence submitted in a computer crime case is documentary evidence.

Demonstrative Evidence

Demonstrative evidence is evidence used to aid the jury. It may be in the form of a model, experiment,
chart or an illustration offered as proof.

9.7.5 Process

In most cases response to a reported incident the initial investigation will be carried out by a nominated
investigator normally the POA Security Manager or a member of the SecOps team. ATOS and POL
Security Teams will be on hand to provide backup and assistance if required. When seizing evidence
from a computer related crime the investigator will collect any and all physical evidence such as the
personnel computer, peripherals, notepads and documentation etc., in addition to computer generated
evidence.

There are four types of computer generated evidence:
e Visual output on a monitor.
« Printed evidence on a plotter.
e Printed evidence on a printer.

e Film recordings on such digital media as disc, USB stick, log files, tape or cartridge, and optical
representation on either CD or DVD.

The investigator will endeavour to obtain as much original evidence as possible. In the event of a court
appearance the court prefers the original evidence rather that a copy but will accept a duplicate if the
original is lost or destroyed or is in the possession of a third party who cannot be subpoenaed.

9.7.5.1 Following the initial investigation and where considered appropriate, the investigator will
report to/ liaise with the local Police and/or other external Agencies; this will only be done following
consultation with the POL Head of security and POL Head of Information Security or substitute.

9.7.5.2 Copies of the initial and follow up reports will be submitted to relevant authorities and details
of all investigations will be held on file by the POA Security to aid any subsequent trend analysis.

9.8 REMEDIAL ACTION

9.8.1 On Completion of report

When the final report of an investigation has been completed, it should be passed to the relevant
authority for follow up action, the results of which should be referred back to the POA Security Manager.

9.8.2 Completion of Investigation

When an investigation is closed the POA Security Manager will ensure all details of the investigation
have been recorded and can be made available for subsequent future analysis.

9.9 TRENDS & AUDITING

9.9.1 Frequency

POA Security Team carries out a monthly check of investigations and creates a summary report
highlighting incidents to the POL Head of Information Security.

The report highlights trends or weaknesses which may need to be raised at future Information Security
Management Forums (ISMF). POA will also submit a quarterly report to the Fujitsu Security
Management Forum, to ensure that Fujitsu Security Incident trends can be reviewed in the round.
