Version: 2.00
COMPANY IN CONFIDENCE, Date: 02/n/o1

1 Introduction
The current process for resolving non-polled outlet incidents has been updated
to ensure:
- that it meets the associated Service Level Agreements (SLAs) [Ref.1&2]
- that all the checks that are required to take place within each of the support

units occur in a timely manner and sequence
- that no unnecessary routing takes place that could delay the resolution
process

Appendix 1 helps to put the process into a daily task perspective, detailing the
day by which elements of the process should be accomplished.

2 Scope
The document details the current baseline end-to-end process to resolve non-
polled outlet incidents. The documented baseline has a limited life span and
will be updated as and when developments to improve the process are
implemented (See Section 0.6 for expected future changes).
The process has been developed to ensure that all the required checks are
carried out within a time scale that allows the associated SLA to be met.
Depending upon the reason as to why an outlet did not poll, the resolution of
the incident can follow more than one path. The process therefore highlights
the role that is carried out by each of the support units potentially involved in
the resolution of a non-polled outlet incident.

ICL Pathway Incident Management Process for Non-Polled Outlets _ Ref: CS/PRD/o80
Version: 2.00
COMPANY IN CONFIDENCE, Date: 02/11/01

The non-polled process is triggered by a report that is produced by the host
system (Tivoli web) in Bootle/Wigan.

The incident management process for non-polled incidents is initiated by the
outlets that have been identified as non-polling, or after investigation, on two
separate occasions in a seven-day rolling period.

Non-Polled report report to PON

The host TPS produces a raw report. This is downloaded by the MSU then
converted (Initial Report) with useful information (outlet closed, number of
counters, geographic regions) before being sent out to SMC, PON, Pathway and

Energis.

This Raw Report is then processed by the SMC Tivoli web-based browser
(Health Checking). The browser health checks each item on the report. The
result of the health check is then sent back to the MSU to be incorporated into
the update report, which is sent to the customer at the end of each working

day.

An outlet that has not polled on two separate occasions in a seven-day rolling
period is generally referred to as a “recurrer”. These are identified by the MSU

to the SMC who will raise an incident.

ICL Pathway Incident Management Process for Non-Polled Outlets _ Ref: CS/PRD/o80
Version: 2.00
COMPANY IN CONFIDENCE, Date: 02/11/01

The MSU will ask SMC to raise an incident on all outlets that have not polled
for 2 days if no incident has been previously raised. (Horizon call logging
prefixed “E-“).

If the outlet no longer appears on the non-polled report the incident is
approved for closure. The process in section 5.6 is then followed.

If an incident that has been appearing on the non-polling report does not
appear, but when checking for closure statement, it is shown to be in the
middle of investigations, the incident will not be closed. The FAD and E
numbers will be added to the bottom of the report and
investigation/monitoring will continue until any problem is resolved.

If the MSU receive a request to approve closure of a non-polled outlet incident
and the outlet is still on the report on the day after it is meant to have been
resolved, they ensure the incident is routed back into the incident management
process for immediate action. The process in section 5.2.2. is then carried out.

The MSU continue to monitor all outstanding incidents and report on their
progress to Pathway, PON, SMC, UKSS and Energis on a daily basis.

S Incident Management Process for Non~Pollead
Outlets

This section details the process for resolving non-polled incidents. The process
has been developed to highlight the role of each support unit involved in the
process.

The MSU, on a daily basis, reviews the “Non-polled Outlet Report”, which lists
all outlets where an End of Day Marker has not been received. An outlet that
has not polled for two consecutive nights is logged by the SMC as an incident.
This is so that the appropriate support unit can investigate the reason for non-
polling. Action can then be taken to get the outlet polling again.

ICL Pathway Incident Management Process for Non-Polled Outlets _ Ref: CS/PRD/o80
Version: 2.00
COMPANY IN CONFIDENCE, Date: 02/n/o1

The SMC receive a set of reports, such as the IFETS report, the Closed Outlet
Report and the Raw Report. They identify incidents with these reports. The
SMC checks if the outlet has been closed since it started non-polling. If so, the
SMC indicate on the Powerhelp record that the incident is ready for closure.

If the outlet is confirmed as open, the SMC check if a related call exists against
the outlet that could resolve the non-polled incident. If so, the related call is
linked to the non-polled incident. This ensures that any updates on the related
incident are reflected in the non-polled incident record. Once the related call
has been resolved, the SMC carry out a health check (Section 5.2.2) to confirm
that the non-polling incident has also been resolved.

The SMC checks for Normal call clearing. If this type of incident is identified,
the incident is logged and routed to UKSS. The SMC check for Destination out
of order, and if identified, the incident is logged and routed to CFM3. If the
outlet still appears not to be polling even though all checks have been
completed successfully, then the incident is routed to the SSC.

The Post Master is informed of the result of the investigation and of the next
action to be taken.

If no related call exists the SMC carry out the health check process (Section
5.2.2) after the incident is logged.

Once an incident has gone through the process once, it is returned to the SMC.
The SMC will carry out any recommendations that have come from the
delivering unit and keep the Post Master informed of any progress. If the
recommendations fail to solve the problem, a new action plan is agreed and
carried out. This continues until the incident reaches its 28 day. At this point,
the “Day 28” process is invoked.

If the recommendations succeed, then the health check is repeated to ensure
there are no problems and the incident is prepared for closure.

ICL Pathway Incident Management Process for Non-Polled Outlets _ Ref: CS/PRD/o80
Version: 2.00
COMPANY IN CONFIDENCE, Date: 02/n/o1

If the gateway can not be pinged:

- The SMC call the outlet to go through a series of checks in an
attempt to resolve the incident. The health check process is
repeated to test if the incident has been resolved.

- If the outlet has already been called, the SMC route the incident,
including outlet access times, to CFM3 (Section 5.4) for
resolution. If the incident has already been to CFM3, the SMC
raise a linked incident and route it to the UKSS (Section 5.3) to
send an engineer to site.

- Ifa UKSS engineer has already been to site, then the SMC route
the incident back to CFM3 requesting a BT engineer to site
(Section 5.4). If a BT engineer has already been to site, the SMC
organise a joint visit to the site between a Horizon and BT
engineer to determine why the fault still exists and to initiate
corrective action.

If there is no fault with the gateway, the SMC check the link to the counter(s). If
there is a fault with the link to the counter(s):

- The SMC call the outlet to go through a series of checks in an
attempt to resolve the incident. The health check process is repeated
to test if the incident has been resolved.

- If the outlet has already been called, the SMC raise a linked incident
and route it to the UKSS (Section 5.3) to send an engineer to site. Ifa
UKSS engineer has already been to site, then the SMC route the
incident to SSC requesting a resolution.

If there is no fault with the link to either the gateway or the counters, the SMC
determine whether or not the incident can be prepared for MSU closure
approval or if it needs to be routed to the SSC for resolution.

The incident is ready for closure if:

- It has been returned from the UKSS or CFM3 and passed successfully
through the SMC health check process. Where a linked incident has
been raised to call out an UKSS engineer to site, this can also be
closed.

- Orhas been resolved by a related call or a call to the outlet.
The incident is routed to the SSC (Section 5.5.1) for resolution if:

- It has passed the health check but has not been previously routed for
resolution to the UKSS or CFM3, and has not been resolved by a
related call or a call to the outlet. For example, the incident is still
appearing on the non-polled report.

“Disconnected” then the cables and the gateway are checked. If the message at
this stage is “Disconnected” then the counter, hub (where the outlet has several
counters) and cables are checked. If the check is successful, then the call is
closed and the incident is routed back to SMC. If the check is not successful,
then the counter is replaced.

If the counter replacement failed, then the call is passed back to the SMC with
an update and a request for more information.

If the first check fails, then the ISDN is checked with the laptop and mobile. At
this stage, a fault may be fixed by the power surge that is generated. It is now
clear that the fault may lie with the gateway rather than the counter and
therefore the Eicon card is tested. If the test is successful then the call is closed.
If the test fails the Eicon card and/or the ISDN card is replaced and re-tested. If
the test fails the gateway is replaced and re-tested.

If the test fails, then the call is passed back to the SMC with an update and a
request for more information.

Having carried out the required work, the UKSS routes the incident back to the
SMC to perform another health check (Section 5.2.2).

Version: 2.00
COMPANY IN CONFIDENCE, Date: 02/n/o1

On receipt of a non-polled incident by ISD (CFM3):

They will determine whether the incident is a Destination out of order type. If
it is not, then the incident is checked to see whether it is Normal Call Clearing.
If it is, then the incident is routed to the SSC.

If the incident is not Normal Call Clearing or a Call Rejected, then it is checked
to see if it is an Incompatible Destination type. The incident is then routed
back to the SMC with diagnostic results.

If the call is a destination out of order type or a Call Rejected, then the ISDN
line and the outlet access times are verified.

If the UKSS engineer has already been to the site, then a BT site visit is
requested. The incident is then routed to CFMq.

On receipt of a non-polled incident by (CFM4):

They will notify BT to perform a remote site check and to conduct a site visit. If
there is a fault, then the fault is resolved and the incident is passed back to
CFM3 for them to perform a health check.

If a fault was not found, then the incident is routed to CFM3 so that they can
conduct a confidence check and then the health check.

CFM3 will ping the debugging router and collect diagnostic information. If the
incident is a destination out of order type, then the incident is routed back to
the CFM4. If there is not, then the incident is routed back to SMC4q for a final
health check.

Non-polled incidents are sent from Powerhelp to PinICL via the OTI. A series of
administrative tasks are then completed in order to ensure that all the details of
the incident are present on the record.

The incident history is then reviewed to ensure that all previous checks

conform to the SSC’s acceptance criteria (see document CS/FSP/006). The
incident is then assigned to a diagnostician. The diagnostician will then carry

out a set of checks that are designed to resolve the fault and are set out in
document Mcroshaw30241L. htm.

If it is determined that resolution does not rest within the SSC, the SSC return
the incident to the SMC, along with appropriate diagnostic information, for re-
routing to the appropriate support unit (Section 5.2.2)

If it is determined that resolution does lie with the SSC, the appropriate course
of action is taken to resolve the incident. Once the incident has been resolved it
is routed back to the SMC who will then update the incident for closure
approval (Section5.2.2).

5.6 The Management Support Unit (MSU)

Since the MSU have requested the raising of non-polled incidents with the
SMC, they are responsible for approving closure of the incident. There are two
criteria against which the MSU approve the closure of a non-polled incident.

The first is when the outlet has been non-polling as a result of it being closed.

The second is when the outlet disappears off the next day’s non-polling report.

The MSU inform the SMC daily, via the non-polled update report, of all
incidents that require further investigation and which incident can be closed.
