The other key point here (cultural) is the message about me ‘being on the side of management’. It’s a

counter-cultural ethos. We want to foster a culture of inclusivity, and not hierarchy, i.e., we don't
want to ‘have sides’, and the sooner we dispel this the sooner we have a great place to work.

Fyi...welcome your thoughts, Karen.

Obviously sharing in confidence as I always will...gives you a sense of where the Chairman is
coming from.

Happy to discuss.

Nick ,

FYI - as I discussed yesterday except that Karen has not discussed with you . I would have thought
that , following our conversation , we should include a comment on para 3 that the management
change process needs to have" started " or some such.

Taking out the point on" Costs " may not be all bad.

We could put the Hubs bit back in if you thought we should - i personally think we should .

Please ensurethat Karen's " tweaking " has not made it more difficult for you . We could weight the
items with a bigger weighting to point 1.

Karen made a point at the RemCo that management " had a sense of entitlement " with the STIP etc .
I picked her up on it in the meeting - I thought she was meant to be on the side of management !
From now on I will step back and let her speak more on behalf of the management .

I was surprised you were not there for all the discussion except on your bonus .

BW,
Henry

Henry,

Please find below, the reworked objectives as requested. I have amalgamated the first two, removed
the banking hubs and the cost savings, and tweaked the wording on the remaining.

I trust this will satisfy the questions from yesterday.

Let me know if there is anything further, I will leave you to discuss and finalise with Nick in the
meantime.

Karen
