Paula
we had a good session this morning at Exco.

Belinda and Angela joined the meeting. I outlined the MP meeting and the specific request. Exco had a
good debate across the range of issues, and on Angela's paper, which we all felt was strong and a key
part of our story once we are ready to tell our story.

We had a frank and detailed discussion. our view as a team was that we should resist the suggestion from
the MPs on the grounds that it would effectively render the working group meaningless, and put us in a
very difficult position legally in relation to cases which have been through the courts.

The view was that the MP meeting was the result of the strategy we embarked on during the summer and that
we should as a result hold our nerve. We believe we have a strong story to tell, and I outlined the ways
in which we propose to ensure our story is out there (and also to tackle media inaccuracy).

We came to the view that in terms of the Board, it would make sense for you to refer to the meeting with
MPs as you present your CEO report, and to report the nature of the MPs’ proposal, but to say that having
consulted with Exco and relevant colleagues you do not intend to change course.

Assuming this is not challenged by the Board, we then recommend a letter to the MPs which sets out our
position and which stays true to the confidentiality of the scheme but which also sets out our over-
arching position - that having set up the inquiry and the Scheme - and paid for both - we are determined
to see it through. we will further say that as the MPs made much of the media requests they had received,
we would be content for them to release the letter to the media. This allows us a vehicle to get our
position out there, strongly.

In the meantime, we will separately contact Oliver Letwin via two constituency cases.

We will also send a holding note to the MPs. Belinda and team are drafting this at present.

Happy to discuss this. Belinda and Angela did a terrific job this morning.

> Not sure - presumably we need to go back to James et al with a decision that the Board wants to
continue the approach we have. Ie., not adopt Oliver's proposition of a general undertaking that (with a
few exceptions), we would mediate if SS recommended it. So we do need a discussion. That could be off the
back of my paper.

Mark, what's your view? And next steps? Pls brief Gavin if we need to add in.
Thx Paula

>>> I hadn't anticipated we would change our approach. But presumably Mark explained seeing Oliver Letwin
to share why we can't answer his question. The discussion needs to centre on what we think the next
steps/fall-out will be and how we manage it. I imagine the Board will still want to be updated even if
there is no sub-Ctte.

obvious time. (And I imagine it will be a topic of discussion over dinner the night before, so I want to
be prepared!) However, It's important so mustn't be 'squeezed in' and mustn't be discussed when people
are tired. Also the team need to be sure they are ready to discuss; and, ideally we take Alice through it
‘irst.

Chris to update on the meeting. By all means discuss thoughts and get Alice’s input but make sure you
give us the time and freedom to look at all options. The Exco need to debate it as well in Thursday
