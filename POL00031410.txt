Project Zebra - Horizon review by Deloittes

Purpose

The purpose of this paper is to:

1.2

Summarise the work undertaken by Deloitte, their approach, key findings, and
their recommendations

Outline POL management's proposed actions in light of the above.

2. Background

2.2

2.3

Deloitte were engaged by Chris Aujard General Counsel and Lesley Sewell,
CIO, to conduct a desktop review of evidential matter as part of project
Sparrow. The terms were based around the direction provided by the Post
Office legal team.

e “POL is responding to allegations from Sub-postmasters that the Horizon
IT system used to record transactions in POL branches is defective and
that the processes associated with it are inadequate. POL is committed to
ensuring and demonstrating that the current Horizon system is robust and
operates with integrity within an appropriate control framework”

Over 100 items of documentation were reviewed by the Deloitte team who
also interviewed management from Atos, Fujitsu, IT, Information Security,
Legal and the Finance Service Centre. (Internal Audit was not involved at this
stage)

A detailed (72 page) report has been issued but subject to legal privilege.
Management reviews and discussion have since followed. A summary Board
paper has also been issued.

3. Approach

3.1

Deloitte structured its work around a number of key control assertions made
by POL over the environment prior to 2010, the changes made to Horizon in
2010 (HNG — X) and transactions and control environment operating today.

The review therefore considered the risks and controls in the following three
areas.

e System Baseline Assurance- original Horizon implementation and 2010
activity.

« IT provision assurance — current IT management activities (security, IT
operations, system changes)

« System Usage assurance — Controls around the business processes, their
design and operation.

l.e. To consider that;
« The system was fit for purpose and worked as intended when first put in.
POL00031410

POL00031410

e Major changes since implementation have not impacted the design
features adversely

« Supporting IT processes are well controlled

« Transactions from the counter are recorded completely, accurately and on
a timely basis

e Directly posted “Balancing Transactions” are visible and approved

* The Audit Store is a complete and accurate record of Branch Ledger
transactions

e Information reported from the Audit Store retains original integrity

« Database administrators (DBAs) or others granted DBA access have not
modified Branch Database nor Audit Store data.

e Data posted from other systems and teams is visible to and accepted by
sub-postmasters

The work was desktop and interview based using information that was

assertions were made.

2010 was noted and verbal assertions from Fujitsu relied upon.
3.3

Documentation review included considerable technical information provided
by Fujitsu plus third party work assurance undertaken by E&Y (ISAE 3402
report on the Horizon managed service), Bureau Veritas (PCI DSS
compliance report on Horizon and ISO 27001) and Royal Mail Internal Audit
(Security controls, 2011, 2012. The POL IA team was not in place until June
2013).

Key Observations and Findings

4.1 The table below summarises the observations documented on pages 4-5 and
25-26 of the full report.
Strengths Areas for attention

Technical Horizon system documentation
is extensive

Documentation is not in a risk and
controls perspective

Audit Store integrity maintained through
digital seals and signatures and
verification processes during extraction of
data from the store.

POL reliance on Horizon features to
operate as described limited to the IT
provision areas of ISAE3402, PCI DSS
and 1SO27001. These may be sufficient
for the purposes of those standards but
may not be enough for full POL reliance
over operation of Horizon Features and
additional testing may be needed.

Governing controls over key day to day
IT management activities independently
tested.(ISAE 3402)

Business use of documentation not
complete or up to date.

Independent reviews (ISAE, 27001, PCI)
provide good coverage for Information
Security, fair coverage for Information
Systems and Change Management

Pre-2010 baseline assurance work not
available.

Recommendations proposed by Deloitte
Deloitte provided detailed recommendations across three areas:

Actions that may assist project Sparrow.
Actions for Future Systems requirements.
Actions for more holistic approach to risk and assurance over Horizon

These are detailed in appendix 1. They centre upon improved documentation,
specific review of the privileged access controls around Balancing
Transactions, detailed analytical testing of historic transactions, system
requirements for any new system and a proposal for a holistic programme of
risk and assurance for POL’s overall risk and control framework.

4.3 The recommendations made are down to management to consider in light of:
¢ Overall business risk.
e Risk Appetite.
e Future of the Horizon System
* Current POL Assurance capacity (1°, 2" and 3” lines)
e Legal imperatives

o The work should also be considered in light of POL senior
management commitments to 10 priority actions and behaviours
(The 10 Accelerators).

o Whilst these should not take precedence over key risks to
information and the Post Office reputation, management will need
to judge priorities, capacity and financial resources.

Perform a detailed review of Balancing Transactions use:

Use suitably qualified party independent of Fujitsu to review controls around the
need to use the Balancing Transactions functionality, communications with Sub —
post masters, reasons for making adjustments and full review of procedures and
policies.

Perform implementation testing of Horizon Features

Use party independent of Fujitsu to conduction implementation testing of Horizon
features. Use the review to confirm features are operating as described from
documentation.

A3

Analytical Testing of Historical Transactions

Audit Store documentation asserts the system holds seven years of branch
transactions and system event activities. In addition assertions over data integrity,
record and field structure and key controls such as JSN sequencing. Not validated
by parties outside of Fujitsu.

Analytical techniques using modern technology for Big Data sets could allow POL to
conduct detailed risk analytics of Audit Store data to verify that the data is as
expected and derive other insights or exceptions.

This may identify Horizon features that could be automatically monitored.

A4

Update / create documentation formalised for all key adjustment and reporting
processes in operation over Horizon in the FSC.

Identify and document all key activities in the FSC for adjustments to Sub
Postmaster ledgers, control activities that reconcile transaction data visible to the
Sub-Postmasters to the Audit Store’s “High Integrity” copy of Branch Ledger
transactions.

This can be used to verify the completeness of the Horizon Features in place that
have been verbally asserted and perform implementation controls verification in A2.

B1

Produce Future Systems Requirement Document

Produce system of requirements for any future Horizon platform to deliver against.
This should include Key Control objectives, current day control activities. Schedule
to include matters that help design preventative, detective and monitoring control
activities. Longevity of data retention in Audit Store and cryptographic requirements
should be applied.

C1 Risk Workshop. Conduct an exercise with Key Stakeholders in POL to create
baseline understanding of risk and risk management concepts, share examples of
other companies, and determine how POL can become more risk intelligent
organisation.

c2 Construct a risk and control framework

Extend and confirm the completeness of the Horizon Features and use the
framework to prioritise areas for improvement. Extend the framework to POL’s
overall risk and control framework, not just those areas relevant to Horizon

c3 Test Controls.

Use the framework to test controls across POL’s risk environment. Use a third party
to operate against a recognised assurance standard.

C4 Sustain Assurance Delivery and Implement more proactive monitoring.

Longer term assurance map to sustain assurance delivery for POL over key risks.
Consider continuous controls monitoring using automated alerts if key behaviours in
the system are identified.

Proposed alternative actions for A4 — Rod Ismay Head of FSC
Ensure comprehensive documentation of:
- Key processes in FSC which identify or respond to accounting issues in branches
Key controls in the data pipeline from point of sale to central finance systems

This can then be used to provide assurance as to the processes and controls around data
transmitted from Horizon and around corrections notified to Sub postmasters.

Reasons for revised proposals:

The FSC does not directly make adjustments to Sub-postmaster ledgers. Instead it identifies
or responds to issues and then sends Transaction Corrections to branches such they are
able to see and satisfy themselves about changes.

Data is held in very different structures in different places which would make the
reconciliation proposed by Deloittes a challenge and may not be beneficial or time efficient

The branch has data in a trial balance list. The audit store has individual transactions. The
FSC will have data batched by client to drive the settlement runs.

e Therefore an action can be to update documentation of the data harvesting and
interface checks down the pipeline and control testing down that pipe. That could
help test the completeness, timeliness and accuracy of data moving down the pipe.
