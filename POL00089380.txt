Attachments: JENKINS Gareth witness statement- Grant Allen 0.1.doc

Dear Steve,

Please see the attached report from Gareth regarding this case which i propose to serve on the
defence. i had asked him to look at the non polling issue raised in Mr Allen's interview and i believe
that he had dealt with it adequately for our purposes. Gareth tells me that it is in fact possible for
him to retrieve the actual data from this time to see what actually occured at this branch and that
the retrieval of the data is free to POL. However he estimates it will take approx 2 1/2 days for him
to look at it and analyse what it meants and this would be chargeable to POL at £2500 approx. i have
told him that at present we do not wish to persue this option unless it become unavoidable. Can you
let me know your thoughts before i get him to sign it off.

thank you

Andrew Bolc

Andrew,
sorry, for the delay, I have been busy on other things - including a couple of days leave.

I have now amended my statement (attached) to cover the specific case of Grant Allen as discussed
below.

Is that sufficient for you at this stage or do I need to cover anything else? When you confirm it is
all complete, I can arrange to get it signed and sent to you as before.

Rachael: Is there anything else that needs to be done for any of these cases before the end of the
year? I am working up to Monday 17th December 2012 and then off site or on leave until Wednesday 2nd
January 2013, so time is fairly limited. Specifically, I've not looked at the cases of Ishaq or Dixon
yet, and the only info I currently have for these two cases are the basic indictments and summary of
facts which would enable me to make a very generic statement if required.

Regards
Gareth

Gareth,

thank you for considering the position so promptly. i can now confirm that the case has been put back
to the 24th January 2012. I would appreciate if you could add your general comments at this stage
regarding the safeguards in place for comms problems to your statement,and send this to me as before
and i will refer back to the Post Office to consider whether we go on to request the retrieval of data
for your further analysis.i say so on the assumption that the data is available for 7 years. an idea
of what 2 days analysis would cost would assist in that decision. with regard to Help Desk calls i
also assume that this is information available freely to POL and therefore would request that enquiry
is carried out. i attach the Horizon non polling report obtained by the investigator in this case
previously.

Regards

Andrew

Andrew,

I've had a look at the statement here and I think it might be helpful to have a dig as to exactly what
went on in the Branch at the time of the initial loss. I think I understand what he is claiming.
However where there are comms problems it is normal to recover any missing data once the comms are
sorted out (provided it is within 35 days), so this shouldn't be a reason for a loss. Also there are
processes in place to retrieve outstanding data where there are extended comms issues lasting more
than 7 days, so as to meet contractual obligations regarding passing all data to Post Office Ltd's
clients within 10 days.

I could just make a general statement relating to that or if we retrieved the data from the time I
could check out exactly what happened in this case.

I've checked with Penny in our prosecution support team and Post Office Ltd have not requested any
audit data relating to this case (she's checked back as far as April 2010), nor have we been asked
about Help Desk calls (which would probably have occurred if there were comms issues).

Is it worth asking Post Office Ltd to request such data for me to examine before putting together a
specific statement for this, or is a simple generic one sufficient?

Note that the data retrieval is part of the standard service that Fujitsu provides to Post office Ltd,
but any time I spend examining the data (say a couple of days) would be chargeable to Post Office Ltd
and so there are commercial considerations for you or Post Office Ltd to consider. As we are nearing
the Christmas break, I can't commit to doing any such analysis before the New Year.

Regards
Gareth

Dear Gareth,

I have just spoken to the solicitor for grant allen.

she is going to ask the court to relist the hearing currently on the Oth December 2012 until Jan
next year which should take the pressure off on this case.

i attach an extract from mr Allen's interview. as in the case summary i sent you he is trying to
suggest that an inital loss of £3000 is attributable to lost data which has not reached head office
because of installation problems. are you able to comment on this scenario at all? ultimately we would
need to discredit this as an explanation that holds any water. he denies stealing the subsequent
losses and therefore by implication may be seeking to blame the system for these lossses as well.
Regards

Andrew Bolc
