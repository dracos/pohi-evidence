Hi Mukesh

Could you give PCO223870 a nudge please? This issue has got some attention in high places in POL.
Getting it targeted at next week’s PTF would be ideal.

Thanks, Kevin

1. The old data has now been removed from the system under MSC_04390378913. PC0224126.

2. Call with development to put a couple of extra checks in during production of Branch Trading Statement, so an imbalance
while handling local suspense is flagged. PC223870, no updates since 24" April.

3. Gareth Jenkins is putting together a briefing note for Lesley Sewell.

4. Andy Winn (POL FSC) has been working out the financial consequences at the affected branches, and I have checked some
of his conclusions.

Technically nothing more to be done, except for getting the extra checks added. Politically, it may run and run.
