Tony, Owain

In relation to paragraphs 10.3 / 10.4 and 11.1 of the GPOC, please find below a briefing note on the provision of
contracts to Freeths.

Types of Agreements
The 198 Claimants are/were engaged on:

Essential 1
Community 6
SPMC 130
Mains 32
Local 19
Assistant / Manager 5
Crown 2
Modified 2
Unknown 1
Contracts

Post Office do not hold copies of either of the Crown Employees' Contracts so we have not been able to provide these
to Freeths. We provided Freeths with copies of the Community Agreement and a Mains and Local Contract on 10
April 2017. The 1994 contract had been provided earlier (on 31 August 2016).

In relation to Freeths requesting these documents from us, the timeline of events is (correspondence attached):

e  Freeths' letter before claim (28 April 2016) requested the contractual documents between POL and

Subpostmasters/Crown Office employees governing those relationships since 1998 (see page 42).

e Our letter of response indicated that copies of the contracts and variations would be disclosed on receipt of
assurances from Freeths (see page 56). The letter of response set out in detail the amendments to the 1994
Contract (see page 92 onwards).

On 31 August 2016, we disclosed the Subpostmasters Contract along with variations.
On 15 December 2016, paragraph 9, Freeths requested disclosure of all other contracts.
On 17 March 2016 Freeths asked for all core contractual documents.

We sent across the mass disclosure of contracts on 10 April 2017.

If you would like any further information, please let me know.
Kind regards

Amy
