Was it "handled" or leaked ?

Hi Bryan
Thope you are well?

Angela mentioned your concerns and I thought I
would reply direct.

It is always a difficult balance to get the handling
right in these cases where media reports on PO
matters. I am sorry you feel we didn't it right on this
occasion.

What I would say is that our statement on the report
- which makes very clear that we do not accept its
findings - was prominent in media reporting for the
very reason you outline.

POL-0100945
We issued guidance to our business centre
colleagues so that they had our position as well, in
the event of any calls.

We had a long discussion on Tuesday evening about
whether to issue wider comms to the network.

We decided against because we felt that doing so
might simply draw attention to the (inaccurate)
report when many, many people would have been
unaware of it. This in itself could have caused
needless concern.

This is a fine balance and I am quite prepared to
accept we don't always get it right though I do on
this occasion think we did (while accepting your
unhappiness with the approach).

We will be reflecting the report in our BAU
channels (subspace) so that our position is clear.

I hope this helps if is not entirely satisfactory to
you.

Best wishes
Mark

Tuesday 09/09/14
5:30pm BBC Radio 4 news summary
referred to:

Post Office's Horizon computer
system

Sub-postmaster's having lost their
positions

&".... including a handful who were
imprisoned..."

Tues evening

Scoured PO website for official
statement - couldn't find it - I must
have missed it

Media pages - the Press release must
be there - nothing listed - started to
think I had imagined the news on
tadio

Wed 10/09/14

8:45 am

"warm up" consisted of hearing staff
talking of seeing local tv news re

PO Horizon,

innocence

Gaoled

Lost businesses

My staff were in a state of shock,
disbelief & anger at how people like
them and their friends could have
been accused of theft, lost their
homes or even worse sent to prison

I was half prepared to meet my
staff's reaction. I gave reassurance as
best I could:

new management at the top (PV)

new policies of openness,
transparency & honestly working
together across the whole
organisation, as per last Forum
meeting in London

Wed night

Scoured PO web site for another
hour - no statement found by my best
efforts

Why was this handled this way?

To ensure the stated policy of
openness, transparency etc is fully
implemented as designed, ie nice
sounding words that will never
permeate even within Head Office /
Support Centre London?

Why was there not a Memoview as a
minimum means of communicating
simultaneous with the press
briefings?

As Michael knows Angela, in the
last few weeks I have been trying to
support branches with Mails
coaching. Please do not
underestimate the blow to counter
staff's and branch owner's morale of
the "news" broadcast on Tuesday

I intend bringing this matter up under
AOB at today’s meeting and am
hoping this note will allow time for
an appropriate answer to be given
