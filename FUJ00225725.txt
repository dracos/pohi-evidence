If we provide the IOPPANBARCODES query and the PANs are encrypted we will just despatch. If they then want
specific items decrypted we can do so and forward.

I have had a look at the request and it was one for PAN or equivalent identifier and details of required PAN decryption,
but you wrote back to Maureen on the 8.07.10 stating that is a PAN no is required then they would need to provide us
with sufficient detail, i.e. PAN No etc. However Maureen wrote back saying that she wanted PAN numbers but did not
provide the information to us.

Did the original request PANs and did we omit them?

The request below was received (ARQ181 & 182) without the PAN numbers requested.
Can the information be requested again to contain the PAN numbers.

Regards

Can you request the Horizon data for Bridgeton PO, Branch code 301832 for the period 28/12/09 to 02/02/10. The data
must include the PAN numbers for Post Office Card Accounts.

I'm aware that the ARQ's are suspended at present, however if this can be done as soon as possible after the
reinstatement of the service.
