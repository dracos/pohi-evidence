First draft attached. I've only done the summary for SR1 however I'd be grateful for your preliminary comments on
whether this is the approach you're looking for?

In the meantime, I'll keep going with the other 3 summaries.

Kind regards

Subject: Second Sight Review
Andy,
As discussed, Second Sight will shortly be presenting an interim report to MPs on their investigation (“Inquiry”) into
the Horizon system.
We want to ensure that all concerned are aware of the responses we have given to the issues raised with us during
the Inquiry (including any supporting documentation).
Second Sight has been conducting the Inquiry in line with the “Raising Concerns with Horizon” document (copy
attached in pdf and Word), the Appendix to which sets out the Remit, Conduct and Output of the Inquiry. I draw
your attention to the following extracts from the Appendix section 3. “Establishment and conduct of Inquiry”:
- “Post Office Limited may provide Second Sight with its own comments on any or all concerns, and on Horizon
generally.”
- “Second Sight will consult with JFSA, Post Office Limited, and/or any other party as it considers necessary
before producing any report."
- “Second Sight will consider and take into account any comments received from JFSA, Post Office Limited
and/or any other consulted party...”
- “Second Sight will prepare the report... bearing in mind the primary need to ensure that the report is reasoned
and evidence based.”
Could you please therefore prepare a document referring to Second Sight’s obligations to consider the evidence we
produce in response to the Inquiry, and summarising the responses we have given on 4 specific Spot Reviews sent
to us by Second Sight, i.e. those concerning the Bracknell Test Centre, communication line interruptions to the
branch terminal, remming-in scratch cards, and stamp stock balancing.
