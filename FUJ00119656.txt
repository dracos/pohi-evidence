Introduction:

This Workbook describes the actions and procedures needed when balancing the Horizon
system. Whilst it is fair to say that no two outlets will necessarily carry out the balancing
procedure in exactly the same way, this Workbook will follow a logical progression that will
conclude with the Cash Account Report being produced for the outlet by the Horizon system.

The Workbook is divided into three sections. Section 1 describes the actions required to
complete Daily and Weekly reports and perform the client cut-offs as required. Section 2
describes the actions that must take place to achieve a Stock Unit balance. Section 3 describes
the actions that need to be carried out to produce the office Cash Account report.

Note:
If you are practising these procedures in the office, the Horizon system must be placed in
Training Mode by the manager.

It would not be practical to cover every possible balancing scenario which could be
encountered on the Horizon system. If you need further help, or if a specific example is not
covered in the balancing Workbook you should consult the Horizon System User Guide.

At the end of each Workbook there is an activity sheet which allows you to practise the
transactions covered in the Workbook. If you are not sure of the answer to a question, simply
re-read the relevant section of the Workbook and try again.

Note:

The Workbooks provide values against a number of products and services that are correct
at the time of going to press. This information is subject to change and you should refer
to the appropriate POCL transaction documentation for up to date price information.

Stock Unit balancing overview Date: 13/12/99 I
Issue: 3.0 I

I

The production of the Cash Account, using the Horizon system, requires you to follow a series
of steps, starting with balancing each Stock Unit in the post office. Once all Stock Units are
balanced, then the Cash Account can be produced. A breakdown of the Stock Unit balance
procedure is shown on pages 8 & 9.

The Horizon system is capable of producing various reports. They can be accessed at any time,
although a number of them must be produced during the Stock Unit balance, otherwise the
process cannot be completed.

The types of Stock Unit used in your post office dictate some of the actions you perform to
carry out the balancing procedure. The declarations used for an Individual Stock Unit are
slightly different from those of a Shared Stock Unit.

This Workbook describes the basic balancing procedure and highlights the differences between
balancing a Shared and Individual Stock Unit, such that the Stock Unit can be rolled over into
the next CAP (Cash Account Period) or the next BP (Balance Period).

Note:
Cash Account Period (CAP) denotes which accounting week you are in during the
current financial year.

Balance Period (BP) can be a portion of a CAP. During periods of high turnover there
may be two Balance Periods during a single Cash Account Period.

Reports are re-produced where required in this Workbook. They are used as examples to
describe the procedure. The types of reports required will be dependant on the business carried
out in your outlet during the last Cash Account Period.

From time to time there may be a discrepancy between the Horizon system derived figures and
the actual holdings of Stock, Stamps and Cash. This Workbook describes adjustments and the
functions available to help locate the source of the discrepancy. In a training environment it
would be impractical to cover every individual problem which may occur when balancing. If
further assistance is required to cure a balancing problem, you should refer to the Horizon
System User Guide and thereafter your POCL Regional Helpline.

Note:
The Horizon System Helpdesk should be used ONLY for Horizon system procedural
problems or equipment defects.

SECTION 1 - HORIZON SYSTEM REPORTS

INTRODUCTION

Introduction:

This section describes the actions and procedures required to produce system-generated reports.
There are a number of different types of reports that can be produced from the system, these are
for information only but they can help to locate an error or mistake carried out on the system.
The Counter Daily and Weekly reports are required to be produced to reconcile the work
carried out in the post office during the day or accounting week. The End of Day process is
also described.

Section 1: Counter Daily reports Issue: 3.0

All Horizon system reports are accessed initially from the Reports icon on the Desktop menu.
The first type of report used in the balancing procedure is the Counter Daily report.

In the following example, you will produce a BT Bills report. The procedure for the production
of other Counter Daily reports, eg GiroBank and National Savings, is the same, with the
exception of the Cheques Listing report.

Note:
The nature of the business conducted throughout the day will determine which daily
reports are required.

From the Desktop menu:

1. Touch the Reports icon, or Press F2 on the keyboard.

The Reports menu is displayed. There
is an icon for Counter Daily reports.

2. Touch the Counter Daily icon, or Press F1 on the keyboard.

The Counter Daily reports menu is
displayed. All the reports accessed
from this menu group can be printed on
the counter printer or previewed on the
screen.

In this example you are going to
produce a BT Bills report.

The report, reproduced overleaf, shows a number of BT Bill payments totalling £369.46 for
Stock Unit AA. The report details the Customer Account numbers and the total volume of
transactions carried out. You can take a report at any time.

At this point you would now reconcile the details on the report. If you find an error has
occurred as part of a transaction a Reversal can be carried out using the session number. An
example of this procedure is shown on page 17. (Workbook 7 also details how Reversals are
carried out).

If you wish to mark the end of the transactions for your cut off, you can do so by activating the
Cut-Off icon (F12).

Note:
Activating the cut off icon will reset the report totals to zero.

5. Touch the Cut-Off icon, or Press F12 on the keyboard.

Section 1: Reverse an existing transaction from a report Date: 13/120

In the previous example, a BT Bills report was produced. If, during your reconciliation of the
details on the report, (prior to activating the client cut off), you notice that the details of one of
the original transactions had been entered incorrectly, then the error needs to be rectified before
the cut-off is carried out.

In this example the customer’s original BT bill payment should have been for £20.00 but
during the transaction on the Horizon system an extra zero was added to the amount. The BT
Bills report produced has indicated that the payment was entered as £200.00. If this transaction
is not corrected a discrepancy of £180.00 will occur when the Stock Unit is balanced. In this
case, the correction can be made by reversing the BT bill payment for £200.00 and completing
a second BT bill payment for the correct amount of £20.00.

The report itemises all the BT bill payments made since the last time the cut-off procedure was
carried out. Note that the Session Number for each transaction appears on the left-hand side of
the Customer Account number. This is required to reverse the original transaction, which is
classed as an Existing Reversal.

The Reversal will start from the Desktop menu:

1. Touch the Transactions icon, or Press F1 on the keyboard

2. Touch the Reversals icon, or Press F5 on the keyboard.

The Reversals menu is displayed.

or Press Fi on the keyboard.

The Transaction Reference screen is
displayed. The system prompts you to
enter the Transaction Reference number
(session number) obtained from the
report.

The reference number is on the left of
the Customer Account number and is in
the format 1-23456.

4. Type the Transaction Reference (session) number from the report.
Check the reference number entered is correct before continuing.

5. Touch the green tick icon, or Press ENTER on the keyboard.

Section 1: Reverse an existing transaction from a report, continued Dates 112

The Horizon system will now search for the original transaction. If it can be reversed the
Horizon system creates another transaction in the stack to the value of -£200.00 to offset the
original BT bill payment.

If the original transaction cannot be found the Horizon system will display a message to that
effect.
6. Touch the Finish icon, or Press ENTER on the keyboard.

The Settlement screen is displayed. You should select the method of payment used by the
customer in the original transaction, ie Cash or Cheque. The Counter Daily Cheques Listing
report can be used to confirm whether a cheque had been used as the original method of
payment, refer to page 19.

In this example the original transaction was completed with a Cash payment by the customer.
7. Touch the Cash icon, or Press F1 on the keyboard.

A Reversal receipt is now produced on the counter printer. The original BT bill payment has
now been reversed.

Note:
The customer’s original BT Bill must now be completed for the correct amount of £20.00.

From the Serve Customer menu, you would now complete a BT Bill payment for £20.00 (cash)
using the Customer Account number obtained from the original BT Bills report.

On completion, the BT Bills report must then be reprinted and the client cut-off performed.
Refer to the procedure on page 13.

Well done!

You have completed an Existing Reversal from a counter report using the Horizon system.

Section 1: Counter Daily Cheques Listing report Pate:

The final Counter Daily report that should be produced is the Cheques Listing report. This is
the exception to the procedure described on page 13.

At the end of the day the Cheques Listing report should be printed (or previewed) and the
cheques reconciled against it. Once you are happy with the information on the report the
procedure can be completed. The cheques can then dispatched to the Data Processing Centre in
accordance with current POCL procedures. However, on the Horizon system, the dispatch of
the cheques is classed as a Remittance Out of the post office. Once the cheques have been
remitted out of the post office the Cheques Listing report can be produced again and the cut-off
applied at that point.

In the following example, the Cheques Listing report will be produced, the cheques remitted
out of the post office (dispatched), and the report taken a second time. Then the cut-off will be
activated.

From the Desktop menu.

1. Touch the Reports icon, or Press F2 on the keyboard.

2. Touch the Counter Daily icon, or Press F1 on the keyboard.

3. Touch the Cheques Listing icon, or Press F10 on the keyboard.

After a short delay, the Produce Report screen is displayed. The report can be printed on the
counter printer or previewed on screen.

4. Touch the Print icon, or Press F4 on the keyboard.

Section 1: Declare the Overnight Cash Holding (ONCH) in a Date:
Shared Stock Unit zo

At the end of the working day, you must declare the Over Night Cash Holding (ONCH). This
declaration can be made from the Counter Daily reports menu. It is a mandatory report.

If the declaration is made in an Individual Stock Unit the system will compare the declaration
against the system-derived cash figure. If there is a difference then Horizon system will inform
you of the discrepancy.

If the declaration is made in a Shared Stock Unit, then the system will prompt you to enter the
declaration identity number for the portion of the Stock Unit that has been declared. The cash
can be declared as one total figure, or a series of declarations corresponding to the number of
portions into which the Stock Unit has been divided. The system will then add all declarations
together to arrive at the ONCH for the Shared Stock Unit.

In the following example you are attached to and using, a Shared Stock Unit. You have
counted the cash held in the whole of the Stock Unit and wish to declare the following figures:

Coins Ip £6.42
Coins 2p £12.26
Coins Sp £28.15
Coins 10p £85.10
Coins 20p £124.00

Once the Counter and Office Daily and Weekly reports have been taken, it is always
worthwhile carrying out the Check Summaries procedure. The system will check to ensure that
all required system reports have been carried out and a message displayed indicating that:

- There are no Outstanding Summaries (reports) that will stop the Stock Unit balance procedure.
or

- There are Summaries (reports) still to be produced. It will also indicate whether the reports
are mandatory ie they MUST be taken before the Stock Unit can be balanced.

This procedure starts from the Desktop menu:

1. Touch the Stock Balancing icon, or Press F4 on the keyboard.

The Stock Balancing menu is displayed.

There are various icons that will
directly affect the stock, including a
Summaries icon.

2. Touch the Summaries icon, or Press F16 on the keyboard.

The Horizon system will now check whether if all the Summaries (reports) have been pro-
duced, and provide a screen message as already indicated above.

The examples on the next page show the two likely messages.

Issue: 3.0

Occasionally an error notice may be generated by a client or by POCL. The post office will be
notified of it and the actions to be taken to correct the error. The Horizon system allows you to
process error notices from the Housekeeping menu. All error notices require a value entry.

Note:
The processing of an error notice will affect the Daily report for some products eg NS.
Error notices must be processed as soon as they are received.

In the following example, an error notice has been received from National Savings. The
notification informs the outlet manager that a National Savings Error Notice Deposit must be
recorded for £50.00.

From the Desktop menu:

1. Touch the Transactions icon, or Press F1 on the keyboard.

The Transactions menu is displayed,
showing an icon for Housekeeping.

2. Touch the Housekeeping icon, or Press F13 on the keyboard.

The House Keeping menu is displayed.

Section 2: Move Vouchers (or Unclaimed Payments) into the Date: 1371208

Suspense Account

The Suspense Account has been created to account for stock or cash that cannot be allocated to
transactions of specific products or stock whose value cannot be entered into accounts proper
until a later date. These items are more commonly referred to as Unclaimed Payments or
Uncharged Receipts and appear in Tables 2, 2A and 3 on the Cash Account report.

To enable the Stock Unit to balance, these items must be moved into the Suspense Account to
allow the items to be carried forward between CAPs. On completion of the Stock Unit roll
over, the items must be reclaimed from the Suspense Account, as this process is not carried out
automatically. If the items are not cleared before the next rollover, the procedure must be
repeated.

In the following example a voucher for £1.04 was accepted as a method of payment. If the
vouchers are still present when the Stock Unit is balanced, they must be moved into the
Suspense Account to allow the Stock Unit to balance.

all the postage stamps held in the Stock Unit. Once you have completed this, you can declare
the stamps on the Horizon system.

Section 2: Declare Cash (Individual Stock Unit) Dates

The final stage of the declaration process is to declare the Cash on Hand. This MUST be
declared last, as the declarations of stamps and stock will automatically adjust the cash figure,
any adjustments or discrepancies are accepted eg if a declaration reduces the number of stamps
you hold, your cash will be credited accordingly.

In the following example you have counted, and wish to declare the following Cash on Hand:

Coins Ip £14.43
Coins 2p £22.26
Coins 5p £40.15
Coins 10p £85.10

During the declaration of the Stamps on Hand or the Cash on Hand, you may view a
discrepancy on the system that you are not happy to accept. If this is the case, once the
declaration has been completed, you can investigate the discrepancy. If you then find that the
stamps or cash were declared incorrectly, they can be re-declared. The Horizon system will
remember the volume or values of the stamps or cash previously declared, allowing you to
overwrite the existing declaration on the system.

From the Desktop menu:
1. Touch the Stock Balancing icon, or Press F4 on the keyboard.

2. Touch the Bal Report icon, or Press F6 on the keyboard.

The system will now perform various checks automatically. For example:

- Have all Daily/Weekly summaries been taken? If not the Horizon system lists all those
Teports not yet produced.

- Are there any negative stock items in the Stock Unit? This would generally indicate a
Remittance In or a Transfer In that had not been completed on the system.

Are there any RD Cheques, POCL Cheques or Vouchers in the Stock Unit? These
should be moved into the Suspense Account and the item adjusted to zero in the
Stock Unit.

- Are there any discrepancies in the Stock Unit?
In this example all summaries have been taken and there were no negative stock items or RD

Cheques, POCL Cheques or Vouchers in the Stock Unit. However the system has found a
minor discrepancy which had been accepted earlier.

The Confirm Loss/Gain screen is

Section 2: Shared Stock Unit declarations Dat * ee

With a Shared Stock Unit the declaration process is slightly different from that of the Individual
Stock Unit. With the flexibility that the Shared Stock Unit offers ie a number of individuals
using the same stock at the same time, a Shared Stock Unit can be balanced in one of two ways:

- The Stamps and Cash can be declared in one go, similar to the Individual Stock Unit, with a
single Declaration Identity number. The stock can be adjusted rather than declared.

- The Stock, Stamps and Cash can be declared in several portions ie the contents of the safe
(or bulk) can be declared early in the day, with the stock and cash in use at the counter
declared as each counter position is withdrawn. Each portion of Stock, Stamps and Cash
must be declared with a different Declaration Identity number.

If the first method is to be used a Balance Snapshot can again be used in the balance process to
help in the physical check of all stock held in the Stock Unit. A stock adjustment can then be
carried out on the system to ensure that the system reflects the actual contents of the Stock
Unit.

The main advantage of the second method is that the balance process can be started during
quiet periods of the day. The contents of the safe (bulk) may be declared early in the day with
a Declaration Identity number unique to the safe, for example 10. The counter may be
operating with two small portions of stock and cash. One of these may be withdrawn in
mid-afternoon and the Stock, Stamps and Cash declared with a different Declaration Identity
number, for example 11. This would then leave only a small proportion of Stock, Stamps and
Cash to be declared at close of business with a different Declaration Identity number, for
example 12. When the Balance Report is ready to be produced the system will then add
together the declarations for Stock, Stamps and Cash ie the stamps declared with the identity
numbers 10 + 11 + 12 would equal the Stock Unit holdings of Stock, Stamps and Cash.

A mixture of the two methods can also be employed, with a single adjustment of stock carried
out at the close of business, with the Stamps and Cash declared, (with different Declaration
Identity numbers), at various points throughout the day.

Section 2: Edit a Shared Stock Unit declaration Date mr

Occasionally you may need to edit a previous declaration made in a Shared Stock Unit. This
may happen if you have declared the contents of the safe earlier and you now wish to remove
some stock from the safe so that it can be sold at the counter. It may also be the result of an
incorrect declaration and after investigating a discrepancy, you may be required to edit a
previous declaration.

In the following example the stock declaration made against the identity number 11 will be
edited to amend a previous declaration of First Class stamps.

From the Desktop:
1. Touch the Stock Balancing icon, or Press F4 on the keyboard.
2. Touch the Decl Stock icon, or Press F3 on the keyboard.

The Declarations menu is displayed.

doing so is identical to that described on pages 61 - 62 for an Individual Stock Unit.

figures and adjusted (if required) to
reflect the actual stock held.

Section 2: Check Shared Stock Unit declarations Dates a2

Before you produce a Balance Report for the Stock Unit, you should check that all portions of
the Stock Unit have been declared, ie there is a declaration of Stamps, Stock and Cash for each
portion of the Stock Unit. This is especially useful if a number of staff have a responsibility for
declaring the portion of the Stock Unit they are using. You can then check to ensure that they
have made their declarations before the Stock Unit is balanced.

Note:
The declaration of stock is not mandatory, it may be carried out as an adjustment.

From the Desktop:
1. Touch the Stock Balancing icon, or Press F4 on the keyboard.

2. Touch the Declarations icon, or Press F9 on the keyboard.

Account Period

Occasionally during the Stock Unit and office Balance procedure, you may be required to roll
over a Stock Unit that has not been used at all during the current accounting week. Since these
Stock Units have remained inactive since the last balance, they can be rolled over using the
previous week’s balance figures.

Note:
Before the roll over can take place, you must ensure that no-one is attached to the Stock
Unit or the roll over will fail.

From the Desktop menu:

1. Touch the Office Balancing icon, I] or Press F8 on the keyboard.

The Office Balancing menu is
displayed. There is also an icon for
rolling over an Inactive Stock Unit.

2. Touch the Inact SU Roll icon, Press F9 on the keyboard.

The Select a Stock Unit to roll as

system prompts you to select the
Inactive Stock Unit that will be rolled
over.

In this example Stock Unit CC has not
been used during the current accounting
week, so it can be rolled over as an
Inactive Stock Unit.

The Trial Cash Account report will now be printed on the A4 report printer. The system will
then return to the Produce Report screen.

The Office Weekly reports must be checked against the Trial Cash Account. If you are happy
to accept the report the Roll Over icon can be activated and the office will roll over into the
next Cash Account Period.

If during this check procedure you find a transaction that has not been carried out on the
Horizon system then a Correction Stock Unit can be created, refer to the procedure on page
115. Once the Correction Stock Unit has been balanced and rolled over into the next Cash
Account Period, the Trial Cash Account must be re-produced.

4. Touch the Roll Over icon, or Press F3 on the keyboard.

The Confirm Rollover screen is
displayed. The Warning message
prompts you to check that all Office
Accounting activities have taken place.

Continuing will result in the office
rolling over into the next Cash Account
Period and the final Cash Account
report being produced.

5. Touch the Confirm green tick icon, or Press ENTER on the keyboard.

After a short delay, 2 copies of the Final Cash Account report are produced from the A4 printer.
Both must be signed and datestamped, one is retained in the post office for 6 years, the second
is forwarded to Chesterfield.

Well Done!

You have produced the Office Cash Account report.

HORIZON SYSTEM Balancing using the Horizon System Ref: PATH/43/002

Section 3: Create a Correction Stock Unit to hold errors in the Date: 1 me
Office Balance 3 3s

During the Office Balance procedure, a member of staff may have rolled over their Stock Unit
having accepted a discrepancy. If the discrepancy is found after the Stock Unit is rolled over
(but before the Cash Account is produced), the Stock Unit cannot be amended, as the figures
have been accepted by the Horizon system. Since this discrepancy has been found, a new
Stock Unit can be created to hold the discrepancy so that it can be accounted for in the office
Cash Account, thereby allowing the office to balance. The discrepancy can then be transferred
back into the original Stock Unit on completion of the Cash Account.

If a correction Stock Unit is created in this way, the outlet manager must make a written note of
when and why the Stock Unit was created. The creation of a correction Stock Unit is exactly
the same as the creation of an Individual or Shared Stock Unit described in Workbook 9.

In the following example, a Green Giro has been paid out to the customer but not carried out on
the system. The cash was taken out of the Stock Unit causing a discrepancy of £50 at the end
of the week. The Stock Unit was balanced and rolled over into the next CAP with the
discrepancy, however the mistake has now been noticed. A Correction Stock Unit will now be

created so that the Giro will be registered with the Horizon system, creating a positive
discrepancy to offset the original one.

From the Desktop menu:

1. Touch the Administration icon, or Press F7 on the keyboard.

2. Touch the Stock Unit icon, or Press F1 on the keyboard.

3. Touch the Create icon, or Press F1 on the keyboard.

In this example an Individual Stock Unit will be created to carry out the Giro transaction.
Correction Stock Units should always be created with an identifier at the opposite end of the
alphabet, to avoid confusion. In this example ZZZ will be used.

4. Type ZZZ

5. Touch the green tick icon, or Press ENTER on the keyboard.

6. Touch the Individual icon, or Press F2 on the keyboard.

A message will now appear indicating that the Stock Unit has been successfully created.

7. Touch the OK green tick icon, or Press ENTER on the keyboard.

The Stock Unit has now been created. However, before the transaction can be carried out, you
must attach yourself to it.

8. Touch the Attach icon, or Press F3 on the keyboard.
9. Touch Stock Unit ZZZ.

10. Touch the Select green tick icon, or Press F1 on the keyboard.
