Subject: RE: eSRF - Project Sparrow with Linklaters

I think I can answer both points.
On the first, it’s OK — although if we could negotiate them down if we give them more. It’s quite steep.

On the second, this was to do with the Deloitte work which I think that they have already done.

Best wishes

Chris, Belinda

Linklaters have discovered some additional cost they want to charge us that they had forgotten about when they

originally quoted. Is this OK with both of you?

They also don’t recognise the final element of work which I added to the SRF after discussions with Chris, which is

highlighted in yellow below. Chris — could you let me know what you want to do on this please?

Many thanks

Jessica

I have set out below the further wording for the eSRF you have requested. The proposed Stage 2 work you have

described in square brackets is not familiar to me. Is it currently anticipated we will be asked to do that? If we do
further work not generally covered by the descriptions I sent Renata initially, we may need to revise the estimate.

As discussed, since sending the eSRF to Renata initially, we have realised there was some time for this matter held on
another Post Office matter. This has now been transferred over. Apologies for not spotting this earlier. The transfer
has resulted in an increase to the Stage 1 fees, as set out below.

Do let me know if you have any questions regarding the estimates or responses to the eSRF below. I should be
grateful if you could send us the relevant PO Number at your earliest convenience.

Kind regards

Jonathan
