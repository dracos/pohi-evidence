Subject:RE: Project Zebra

James — three additional points:

1) We have discussed as some length the need to provide as much comfort as is possible in respect of the period
prior to 2010. For clarity, could you kindly confirm that you still propose to do this?

2) On the question of the audience for the document, this is principally the Board in the first instance; as discussed
we will however, want to be able to use any high level conclusions you may reach as a foundation for the
release of the Linklaters advice — at this stage we are not sure what form we would need your conclusions to be
expressed in (I expect that they may need to repackaged and summarised, with the appropriate release letters
signed), but I did want to make sure you were fully aware of our intentions in this regard.

3) The proposed timing does not work at all for us. The board were expecting a readily digestible document
addressing the key matters that we have been discussing over the last few weeks last Friday, not next
Wednesday. Out of courtesy, I should let you know that I have spoken to Paula, our CEO, and she is now
minded to escalate the matter further within Deloitte.

lam offsite at meetings all morning, but should be available by lunchtime. In the meantime Alwen and Rod are in the
loop.

Regards

Chris

CONFIDENTIAL AND SUBJECT TO LEGAL PRIVILEGE

Chris,

Further to our conversations today, I wanted to confirm the next steps we propose to take regarding Project Zebra.
These seek to create a shorter document for you (intended for Board circulation) which focusses on certain key (and
most relevant) aspects of our wider work to date.
POL00346406
POL00346406

This “Board Briefing” document will focus on the four questions we agreed by phone, being:

1. What comfort can be taken that Horizon only allows complete transactions (baskets) to be processed?

2. What comfort can be taken that the transactions completed in Horizon are ‘digitally sealed’, to protect their
integrity and make it evident if they have been tampered with?

3. What comfort can be taken that Horizon’s Audit Store maintains and reports from a complete and unchanged
record of all sealed baskets?

4. What comfort can be taken that Horizon provides visibility to sub-postmasters of all centrally generated
transactions processed to their Branch ledgers?

For each of the above questions, we will:
e List those relevant high level system design and process control features that we identified in documentation
provided to us;
e Describe the facts relating to the extent and nature of the Assurance Work we have seen;
¢ State what additional work could be undertaken to increase the level of comfort.

Our comments will be framed in the context and limitations of our work.

We estimate that this deliverable will take until close of play on Wednesday next week to produce and issue through our
review and signoff activities.

Please confirm that these points of focus are an accurate view of the next steps discussed this afternoon.
Thanks and regards

Gareth
