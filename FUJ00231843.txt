Ken, Hilary

I'm ok with this, and have had a quick chat with Mark. We have agreed the approach we want to take is to bill the
outstanding 31 against this PO, and then call off against the balance of the PO for any additional over the contract limit
of 100, incurred next year.

Hope that clarifies

Darryl,

I do not see the need for a separate CT and another Purchase Order.
Fujitsu should just bill the 35 ARQ requests against the purchase raised
for this CT and roll the remaining 65 forward into the new Financial Year.
The number of requests will be monitored on a monthly basis and if we
approach using up the additional requests in addition to our existing
annual allowance, then raise a new CT at that point.

Please respond on this basis

FYI, please see emaal below from FS on the proposed way ahead for charging
the costs on the chosen option in relation to this CT.

Mark/Katrina - please note the para re: 35 ARQ's used over and above the
current years (2008/9) allocation - a CT will be raised to cover the cost
of this.

Darryl,

Thank you for the sign-off of CT0724 “Increase the current threshold of 100
Audit Request Queries (ARQ's) for Banking and Card Account Products, to
either 200, 250 or 300 per annum.” and the subsequent confirmation of the
Post Office Ltd choice of Option 1 within the CT. This has been discussed
internally and the Fujitsu business owners have requested that I provide
the following update:

With regard to the sign-off of CTO724, Fujitsu propose to invoice the 2mds
for Service Description updates against the quoted Purchase Order number.

The increased ARQ numbers will be invoiced under the appropriate service
charge once the Service Description and associated CCN have been approved
and signed-off — as such this will be for the forthcoming financial year
2009/10- this will tie-in with the request from Post Office Ltd that this

increase is only for a year and will be monitored and assessed over this
period.

Over and above this a further CT will shortly be raised and submitted to
Post Office Ltd for the c. 35 additional ARQs that have been progressed in
the last year over and above the currently agreed contractual amount, based
on the charge in Schedule D1 (Para 5.5).

Fujitsu would be obliged if you could formally provide this update and
details of the planned approach to the Post Office Ltd business owner for
this area and other relevant parties.
