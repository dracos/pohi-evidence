Dear Mandy and Cheryl,
I tried to contact you both today, but you were not available.

1. Mandy, please can you let me know whether the Post Office has
experienced widespread problems with Horizon? Mr Castleton's solicitors
are seeking disclosure of this sort of information before they agree to
mediate. If it would be difficult for you to find out this information,
please can you give me an idea of how and why it would be difficult (and
expensive) to retrieve it? (eg perhaps there are no central records).
This will give me some ammunition to go back to Mr Castleton's
solicitors with to explain why the Post Office does not feel it is
appropriate to disclose it and to try to persuade them to mediate sooner
rather than late.

2. Cheryl, I know you say the paperwork removed form Marine Drive can't
now be found, but did the Post Office keep a list of what items it
removed? Do you know that the Post Office definitely removed the
documents Mr Castleton seeks? Do you have the contact details for Mrs
Oglesby so that I can discuss this with her? She will be an important
witness.

I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.
Kind regards.

Dear Mandy and Cheryl,

Thanks, Cheryl, for your e-mail of 10 November.

I note that the Post Office is not able to find the documents which it
removed from the sub post office. These documents are crucial to Mr
Castleton's Defence and the Court will draw adverse inferences if we are
not able to produce them. This reinforces my view that we should seek
an early settlement.

I attach a letter dated 10 November 2005 from Mr Castleton's solicitors
to Bond Pearce for your information, together with an article from the
November 2005 edition of the Sub-Postmaster Magazine in which a
sub-postmaster in Chelmsford complains of problems with the operation of
the Horizon computer system. Other sub-postmasters'’ problems are in my

POL00073739
POL00073739
POL00073739
POL00073739

view irrelevant to the issue of whether the Horizon worked for Mr
Castleton, unless there is evidence of widespread problems. Mr
Castleton's specific point is that there are widespread problems with
Horizon and accordingly he should not have been dismissed.

Mandy, I look forward to hearing from you in relation to my 9 November
letter. If it will be helpful to discuss things please
do not hesitate to contact me on telephone number

Kind regards.
