Subject: RE: Update on the status of the claims relating to Horizon - Privileged & Confidential
Chris

Many thanks for this very helpful note.

As regards the fifth claim, it would be helpful to know to which former spm the case relates (several
JFSA members have, over time, written individually to Ministers or to me) and also to know if the
request for an oral hearing is made/granted. Also, was the procedural error on which the case was
struck out the fact that POL was not notified that action had been initiated until months after the
event and if so was the error with the Court Service or Shoosmiths?

Regards

Mike
