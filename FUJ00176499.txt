Subject: RE: Horizon Queries
Hi Farzin,

Well as part of the migration to AWS we had a meeting with Post Office personnel and they were unaware
that the Horizon data on PARC201 and PARC202 is different!

For any given Horizon transaction it is put in different files for PAR201 and PARC202.

So the generated spreadsheets are the same (wherever run from) but the files retrieved are different.

Every so often a query works on one but not the other, for example PC0268776.

So we may wish to run 100 random Horizon queries (i.e. pre 2010) on the two servers and confirm that the
results are the same. What I stated was that it is my belief that rarely translations might be missing from one or the
other but when not missing they are always the same.

How would we normally cost such an exercise?

Regards,
Gerald Barnes

Hi Gerald,

Not that I am aware of. However, this may have been done as part of migration to HNG-X, well before I joined Sec
Ops.

Hi Farzin,

Has there ever been an exercise when old Horizon Queries were run both on IRE11 and IRE19 and it
confirmed that the results were the same?

Gerald Barnes
