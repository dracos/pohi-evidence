Subject: Cleverly Court Case - Update

The PO Legal person, Mandy Talbot, is on holiday today but will be back in on Monday. I've left a message asking her to
call me but will chase her up anyway.

I've also spoken to Keith Baines who alluded to a number of other calls that he was going to have to make on the case but
didn't pass any details to me. He said that Dave Smith would be speaking to lan on the subject - it seems that Dave
believes 'we' (not sure whether that's the royal we or just us) have conceded what 'we' should not have done and POL are
now in a difficult position. Given our late involvement by POL I trust he's not trying to park it all on us.

Court dates are August 16th, 17th and 18th as currently planned.

Regards,

Jan Holmes
