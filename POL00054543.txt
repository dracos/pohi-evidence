following our discussion thanks for this.

given that we will now be seeking recovery via the spmr can you ensure you liaise with the Contracts team as
there may be obvious impact/ repercussions.
Cheers,

I have reviewed this case and find that we have dropped the theft charge and successfully prosecuted the 3
counts of false accounting. As this defendant is a sub-postmasters assistant (office manager) and his contract is
with the sub-postmaster and not us I find it difficult to quantify the benefit figure in this case. I believe that we
should withdraw from the confiscation process and that recovery for POLTD should be through the sub-
postmasters contract and for the sub-postmaster through the civil courts for compensation based on any contract
that they believe is enforceable.

Please withdraw from the confiscation process.
