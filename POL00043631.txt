Kay Linnell informed the Working Group that Alan Bates had sent her a message that

1. Minutes of 14 November meeting
The minutes of the meeting of 14 November were agreed.
2. Update on Part 2 progress

Further to the discussion at November's Working Group meeting, lan Henderson reported
progress on the completion of Second Sight’s Part Two Report. Key points included:

e Second Sight were on track to submit their outstanding questions to Post Office by 9
December, in line with the agreed schedule;

e there were a 110 questions but these were intended to be comprehensive;

eit was a likely that there would be supplementary questions following Post Office’s
response;

e Post Office were due to respond to Second Sight’s questions by 6 January and
meeting had been set for 9 January to go through the detail of their responses; and

« inthe meantime, Second Sight would begin to update their draft report using Post
Office’s response and other material received from Post Office, along with cross-
referencing the questions to the relevant source material.

Chris Aujard asked if he may report Second Sight’s update within the Post Office. This was
agreed.

The Chair said that he still wished Second Sight to address the question of who the most
likely beneficiary from losses in branch was. If, for example, the customers were the most
likely beneficiary from counter errors generating a loss then he would like to see that
reflected in Second Sight’s reports. Post Office agreed that, where possible, they would also
set this out in the remaining POIRs and CRR responses. Ron Warmington suggested it if it
was not theft in branch, the beneficiary was likely to be the customer.

The Chair said that reading through a number of cases had left him with the impression that
a number of people appointed as Subpostmasters were unable to cope with the role.

3. Post Office provision of legal documents

Belinda Crowe reported progress on the provision of legal documents to Second Sight from
Post Office. Key points included:

* an update was sent to Second Sight on 4 December on progress with their requests;

« the Secretariat were now tracking progress against Second Sight’s requests;

¢ In asignificant number of cases there were no further documents to be shared.
However, Post Office were checking thoroughly in each case;

e where documents did exist it took some time for the files to be retrieved, papers
copied and information redacted (where for example it contains personal data such
as bank account numbers); and

* alist of priority cases had been agreed based on where progress in completing
CRRs or resubmitting them was dependent on the provision of legal documents
(should they exist).

Belinda Crowe said that M031, M053 and M093 were listed for discussion today. However,
Post Office had agreed to mediation and the Secretariat had passed the cases to CEDR.

Tom Wechsler reported that the Secretariat had reported the Working Group’s decision on
granting an extension for comments to the applicant's advisor in case M091. The advisor
had still not provided a date when comments could be expected despite having been
reminded to do so.. Given the applicant's circumstances, it was agreed that the Working
Group would wait until after Christmas before pressing the matter further.

5.6 Cases where the Working Group has made mediation recommendation

Belinda Crowe said that the spreadsheet incorrectly showed that M048 was with CEDR. It
had in fact been settled prior to mediation.

Of the cases where the Working Group had concluded its consideration, 20 had been
passed to CEDR for mediation. Of those 20, Post Office had declined to mediate 2 cases.

5.7 Any other queries raised by Applicants / Advisors

No queries raised

5.8 AOB

None

6. Cases for decision

a) Second Sight do not recommend mediation

Kay Linnell said that Alan Bates had asked her to report to the Working Group that he
required 4 weeks to consider any case where mediation was not recommended rather than
10 days as previously advised.

Action: Secretariat to reschedule consideration of case M116 for January’s Working
Group meeting and draft a letter to inform the applicant of the delay in considering his
case

b) Second Sight recommend mediation

The Chair asked Kay Linnell if she was able to stay for the remaining discussion in order to
offer a view on behalf of JFSA. She replied that she was able to stay as an observer but not
to take part in the discussion.

Chris Aujard said that the Post Office continued to be concerned that JFSA were not taking
part in Working Group discussions on cases. There were a number of cases for discussion
where the decisions were very balanced. He wished to place on record Post Office’s
continued encouragement to JFSA to play a full part in Working Group discussions so that
the Working Group may benefit from their views and knowledge of the applicants.

The Chair said that JFSA’s decision not to participate remained unsatisfactory and placed a
significant burden on him when casting his determining vote and on Second Sight who were,
in effect, called up to make the case for the applicant. He understood that Alan Bates did
not agree with his ruling on the role of the Working Group in determining the suitability of
cases for mediation. However, he had made his rulingwas not prepared to change it. He
asked Kay to ask Alan to reconsider his position.

The Chair said that when he had made his ruling he had not anticipated that Post Office
would be inclined to vote against Second Sight’s recommendation in as many cases as they
appeared to be doing. His expectation was that cases would be subject to a Working Group
discussion and his casting vote by exception. This had not turned out to be the case.

Post Office responded that they had not determined how they wished to vote prior to the
Working Group meeting in a significant number of cases. The reason for asking for the
cases to be discussed at Working Group meetings was to establish greater understanding of
the rationale behind Second Sight’s recommendations. Post Office is particularly concerned
as Second Sight were recommending mediation in almost all cases. They were particularly
concerned about raising the expectations of applicants that resolution may be achieved
through mediation where cases had been described by Second Sight as “weak”, where there
was little information available or where Second Sight had also suggested that an applicant
might benefit from a discussion with Post office so that the relevant issues could be
explained.

The Chair suggested that these were issues that could be resolved prior to the Working
Group between Post Office and Second Sight. He wanted to be clear prior to the meeting on
exactly which cases he might be required to exercise his casting vote. .
POL00043631

POL00043631

He suggested that the meeting adjourn for a short period so that Post Office and Second
Sight might consider how to proceed with the remaining cases for discussion. This was
agreed.

The meeting reconvened.

Chris Aujard reported that following their discussion Post Office and Second Sight agreed
that under the present arrangements Second Sight only had the choice to recommend,
whether a case was Suitable for mediation or not. However, there was a category of cases
that whilst Second Sight believed them to be weak the applicant would benefit from an
explanation of events that had led to their difficulties. Despite the other weaknesses of the
case, they felt the benefit of an explanation tipped the balance of argument in favour of
mediation rather than no discussion at all. For its part Post Office had indicated on a
number of cases that they were content to meet with applicants and offer an explanation of
events but they remained concerned in such cases that agreeing to mediation raised the
expectations of applicants that alternative resolution may be achieved.

It was proposed that Post Office and Second Sight work up a third option for the Working
Group to consider in these circumstances currently described as a “structured discussion”.
This would not take the form of a formal mediation but instead offer a forum in which Post
Office and the applicant could work through the events that had led to the applicant's
difficulties so that they may understand them better.

Following a discussion, the Working Group agreed that Post Office and Second Sight should
work up a proposition for a “structured discussion” options for the Working Group to
consider. That proposition should take account of the following points:

¢ whether a 3” party might facilitate such a discussion;
¢ whether applicants might be accompanied by their legal advisors; and
«what would happen if new information emerged during the course of the discussion.

Post Office wereasked whether, should this alternative proposition be agreed, they would
agree to the majority of Second Sight's recommendations. Post Office said that they could
not commit to that but if Second Sight’s recommendations for cases suitable for mediation
were based on evidence of some wrong-doing on the part of Post Office there was a far
greater likelihood that they would consider it appropriate to do so.

The Chair asked Post Office to look again at its view on the suitability of cases for mediation
where there had been a criminal conviction. Post Office agreed to do so.

Action: Post Office and Second Sight to work up a proposition for an option of a
“structured discussion” for the Working Group to consider at its meeting in January.

It was agreed that no cases scheduled for discussion under item 6b would be discussed.
The Chair invited Second Sight to consider how many of those cases might be more suited
to a “structured discussion” rather than mediation in preparation for January’s Working
Group meeting.

Action: Second Sight to consider how many of those cases might be more suited to a
“structured discussion” rather than mediation in preparation for January’s Working
Group meeting.

Action: Secretariat to draft a letter to inform the applicants of the delay in considering
their cases.

c) Second Sight recommend mediation

Belinda Crowe explained that in case M042, Second Sight recommended mediation be
deferred until the completion of their Part Two report. Post Office had indicated that they
were content to mediate the case now. It was recommended that the precedent set at the
POL00043631
POL00043631

last Working Group meeting be followed and that the applicant be given the choice. This
was agreed.

Action: Secretariat to a draft letter to the applicant in case M042, informing them that
the Working Group had decided that their case was suitable for mediation and
offering them the choice of mediating now or when the Part Two Report had been
finalised, in the knowledge that this was not likely to be before end March 2015.
