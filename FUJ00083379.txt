Branch Outreach Issue - Description FUJITSU

There are actually 2 potential separate issues here, and it is the combination
of the two issues that may lead to the scenario described above:

™ The Forced Log Out

™ Doesn't correctly close down the Post Log On script. This leaves the script on the “stack”
of incomplete processes

™ The Pouch Delivery script thinks it has completed doesn’t explicitly finish

m™ When the Remittance is complete and all the receipts have been printed, the last screen
asks the user to press Enter to complete the Remittance process

™ It relies on a mechanism which checks the stack of incomplete processes to see if it is
complete. Due to the fact that the stack is not empty (following the first problem) it thinks
it has not finished and as a result attempts to repeat the last part of the script, which in
this case is to record the remittance transactions and print the receipts

@ Audit found 112 occurrences of Duplicate Pouch Id’s over the
past 5 years
= The audit highlighted 3 issues with Duplicate Pouch Id’s
m™ 47 Outreach Cases identified equivalent to the current item
™ 19 using ‘Prev’ Button after pouch scan - fixed Mar 2010
m™ 46 Pouch remitted at multiple Counters - fixed Jan 2011
™ 108 items corrected at the time either by:
™ Transaction Correction by Post Office
m= Sub Post Master reversal completed at the time
m 4 items still to be confirmed

™ No correction records obvious in database Post Office to advise if any
corrections etc. raised

# No items relate to Mediation Periods

Data Analysis Method FUjITSU

@ Historical Checking of Data

The following is a breakdown of the initial analysis completed to
date (9"" December 2015).

™ Fujitsu have retrieved and analysed the BLE files (branch
data transfer files to POLSAP) in archive audit storage

™ We then Correlated any outputs against Mediation cases
post 2010 when HNGX was introduced

Branch Outreach Issue — Overview FUJITSU

™ This code was produced for HNGX which went live in 2010

= However this particular problem would not have been present on the
old Riposte-based Horizon system that was running until 2010

™ Receipts were generated for all the remittance transactions
plus

= They are all clearly visible as individual transactions in the Transaction
Log (which is viewable locally) and

@ Also in the Audit Trail (which is used as the basis for any evidence of
the system’s behaviour)

m™FSC and NBSC now have knowledge base for this issue

™ Proposed Change

= The proposal is to issue a hotfix to ensure that a Forced Log Out
correctly clears down the stack of incomplete processes

The Core Audit Process - Reminder FUJITSU

The Horizon Application has been designed to ensure that accurate and auditable
records are kept of all sub-postmaster transactions

When a transaction is conducted at a counter, an auditable mechanism has been
built in to ensure these transactions are taken from the counter, stored in the
Horizon main branch database and then copied to an audit database

This mechanism can be considered a ‘closed loop’ where information is securely
exchanged from the counter to the Horizon branch database and then on to the
audit database

Whilst copies of transaction data are provided to numerous external systems from
the main Horizon database, once an audit record is created, it becomes security
sealed and time stamped. Audit records cannot then be accessed or altered
without detection and the creation of further auditable events

The Core Audit Process is designed to provide a definitive log of all transactions.
As such it is the “base” upon which any assessment as to “what was entered at
the counter” should be derived from to the exclusion of all other systems that may
take a feed of data from the Branch Database

A number of ‘assertions’ can be independently examined to test the robustness of
the Core Audit Process
