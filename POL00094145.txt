Introductions phase at the beginning of a suspect

1)

interview, on tape, under caution.

Tapes on straight away.

Personal introductions, establish 1°* names, if possible. “My name's
(interviewee’s name) can I call you....?”

Interview being recorded and we are in......... time and date, I'm sure the 1*
thing you want to know is what this is all about.

REASONS (note the reasons below are headings, don’t speak them)

Reason for the investigation

I'm investigating (a theft of mail/a number of mail thefts/whatever).
That means, theft of Special Delivery items which had cash in them.

Reason we've picked you

You were working in the SD locker when these items first went missing.
They tured up on your walk, opened, with the cash gone

Reason for the interview -

This interview is your opportunity to tell me if you were involved or, if
not, anything and everything you know about them

Check - Do you understand? Is there anything you want to ask me?

ROUTINES

1)
2)

3)

So, what I'm going to ask you to do is tell me, in as much detail as you can,
everything you know about these SD items and the cash that was in them

Before you do it’s important that you know your rights, so I'm going to
explain them to you and check that you understand

Give the Caution
Explain it

Ask the 3 questions

You also need to know that you're NOT under arrest and that you are free
to leave at any time.

You also have the right to speak to a legal advisor at any time. That means
now, before we start the interview or at any time during. “Do you want
to...2”

Check - Do you understand? Any questions?

Because you're an employee of Royal Mail you can have a friend with you in
the interview and that “friend” can be from the Union. “Do you want....2”

OK, now I'll explain to you how we're going to do this. There are no tricks, I
only want the truth. I’m going to ask you simple questions about what you
did on certain days.

Take your time, think about what I ask you and then think about your
answers and tell me in detail.

If you don’t understand what I've asked you, please say and I'll try and put it
a better way. It’s the same for me, if I don’t understand something you're
telling me I'll ask you to go over it.

Check - Is that OK?

“other investigator's 1 name” will be making notes - to help alt of us make
sure we cover everything.

We'll be having breaks as we go along. These will help us to plan the next
part we want to cover AND to give you thinking time in case we miss
something.

Because the interview is being recorded and might be listened to later it’s
important we don't talk at the same time. So, when you're talking I'll wait
until you're finished before I ask another question and if you could let me

finish before you speak that would be very helpful.

Check ~ is that OK?
