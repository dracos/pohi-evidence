Thanks Melanie
Don’t think we should do the legal advice points at this stage but facts and figures we can let you have.

Best wishes
Belinda

Yes happy to draft ~ Matthew is sending me the chain. Depending on timing (subject to the various discussions that will
go on re the options on Linklaters) is there an opportunity to also include/ underline some of the legal advice points?

Dear all,

Please see below email from James Arbuthnot’s office. Could you have a think about how we should respond and advise
next steps. It would be good to have a draft ready on Monday, with a view to sending to Janet on Wednesday.

Many thanks,
Avene

Dear Paula,
James has asked me to thank you for your letter of 12 June. He wonders whether you might send him

something to consider by way of a circulation to MPs by the end of next week. He would like to be able to tell
the MPs why no meeting is going to take place, and what progress is being made.

Might your office let him have something to consider, please?
Many thanks.

Yours ever,
