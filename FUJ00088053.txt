1.0 Introduction

1.1 Purpose

This Security Functional Specification (SFS) defines the security functionality that is
incorporated into the Horizon system. It is primarily concerned with the technical features
rather than the surrounding management or operational controls (defined in [SECPRO]).

1.2 Context

There are three broad categories of security controls, as illustrated in Figure 1.1

Management

Security Policies
Security Organisation
Asset Classification

Compliance

Technical

Authentication

Access control
Audit trails

Cryptography

System Access Control
Development and Maintenance

Business Continuity Planning

Security Control Categories

This document focuses on the technical security controls that are primarily concerned with
authentication, access control, audit and the use of cryptography (as illustrated above).

ISO 17799, “A Code of Practice for Information Security Management”, is primarily
concerned with management and operational controls. It is used as the basis of Pathway’s
Security Procedures [SECPRO] to define the controls used throughout Pathway.

1.3 Scope

This Security Functional Specification (SFS) identifies the technical controls that are used to
implement the security functionality within the Horizon system [SADD].

The (logical and physical) environment to be protected is defined in the Technical
Environment Description document.[TED].

Version: 6.0
COMMERCIAL IN-CONFIDENCE Date: 12-SEPT-2002

Where ever possible Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components have been used as the
primary building blocks throughout the Horizon solution. This reduces the need for bespoke
code and enable suppliers’ standard product documentation to be used.

An overview of the security functionality, provided by the security components (identified in
section 4.0), has been included in order to define the security features and system options that
are used.

Control of access to the Horizon system and data is in accordance with the Pathway’s Access
Control Policy [RS/POL/003].

1.4 Pathway Security Policy

Pathway Security Policy document [SECPOL] encompasses all of the security requirements
specified in Pathway’s agreement with Post Office Ltd. A summary of these security
requirements is defined in the document Pathway Security Objectives [SECOBJ].

By implementing the agreed Security Policy, Pathway will minimise and control liabilities to
itself and Post Office Ltd. The Security Policy also explains how Pathway will comply with the
controls defined in ISO17799.

This Functional Specification forms part of the IT security infrastructure identified in the
Security Policy.

1.5 Document Structure

This document specifies security functionality within a framework of explanatory text.
References to the associated documents, listed in section 0.3, are indicated by the document

2.0 Management Summary

2.1 About this Document

This Security Functional Specification (SFS) defines the security functionality that is
incorporated into the Horizon system. It is primarily concerned with the technical features
rather than the surrounding management or operational controls.

2.2 Security Domains

The term “domain” has been used to describe distinct parts of the system characterised by
type(s) of service provided, components used (e.g. NT), and/or area of responsibility. The
domains are:

e Post Office Ltd. Central Services Domain,

¢ Office Platform Service Domain,

e Post Office Ltd. and Post Office Ltd Clients Domain,
e System Management Service Domain, and

e Pathway Corporate Services Domain.

The Post Office Ltd Central Services Domain contains the Horizon application hosts at the
central Pathway sites.

The Office Platform Service Domain encompasses the Electronic Point Of Sale Service
(EPOSS) including Debit Cards (DC), which supports all services, or products, provided by
the counter clerk to the customer.

The Post Office Ltd. and Post Office Ltd. Clients Domain contains a variety of hosts
associated with applications running in the OPS Domain.

The System Management Service (SMS) Domain contains the central elements of the System
Management (SM) and Network Management System (NMS) facilities.

The Pathway Corporate Services domain supports Pathway’s own management processes.
The domain encompasses the Data Warehouse and Pathway’s managed services

There is no special (or cryptographic) protection required for the Order Book Control Service
(OBCS) service and Electronic Stop Notice Control System (ESNCS) link, therefore it is not
shown as a separate domain.

The NBS utilises functionality within the Office Platform Service and POL Central Service
domains to deliver NBS related messages to the Network Banking Engine operated within the
context of the POL and POL Clients Domain.

2.3. Security Components

The security enforcing components within the Horizon system are Windows NT, Dynix
operating system (on Sequent platforms), Solaris operating System (on Sun platforms), Oracle
7/8i and MS SQL Server database products, networking components (including firewalls and
routers) and encryption devices.

Fujitsu Services SECURITY FUNCTIONAL SPECIFICATION Ref: RS/FSP/001
Version: 6.0
COMMERCIAL IN-CONFIDENCE Date: 12-SEPT-2002

Firewalls are used to protect the Horizon system from unauthorised access via external
networks and other local networks collocated at Pathway or Fujitsu Services sites. Protection
is provided by a combination of packet filtering functionality within router components and
application level firewalls.

Riposte, which is security relevant, is also security enforcing whenever it is configured to
handle user authentication.

Virus protection facilities are installed on selected platforms.

2.3.1 External support users of Horizon systems are permitted access to Pathway Data
Centre systems only from approved outlets/environments and subject to agreed
network and other controls (sce 6.10).I[dentification and Authentication

Identification and authentication mechanisms are required to ensure that all users are uniquely
identified, with only authorised users being granted any access to the system.

This document, therefore, defines overall requirements for user identification and
authentication followed by specific consideration of users of NT, Dynix, Solaris, Oracle, Help
Desk operators and Post Office Ltd. staff.

2.4 Logical Access Control

This document considers the access rights that need to be supported by system components
and the ability of the system to enforce access rights.

To provide effective control of system resources, Pathway has produced a clearly defined
Access Control Policy that identifies all users who are authorised to access any part of the
system and the access rights that are to be permitted

The Access Control Policy is expressed in terms of roles rather than named individuals. Users
are then associated with one or more roles so that all persons are individually accountable for
their actions.

In addition to control of access to databases, use of the access controls supported by Windows
NT, Dynix, Solaris and Routers has been included.

2.5 Audit and Alarms

The audit and alarm facilities provided by the Horizon system are a combination of application
level transaction logs and lower level audit tracks.

The Riposte application provides an ideal basis for logging all transactions to give a complete
picture of actions within Post Offices Infrastructure Service.

Patrol is used to manage all Sequent systems and the Oracle applications that run on Sequent
platforms.

Wherever possible, application level auditing is used. The notification services provided by the
systems management products (notably Tivoli) is used wherever appropriate. Low level
Windows NT audit tracks is also used to provide additional facilities where application level
auditing of system management activities is not supported.

2.6 Crypto Functionality

This document describes the cryptographic functionality, within the Horizon system, used to
protect:

e data on individual communications links,

e individual messages from creation to use (end-to-end),
e data stored on physically insecure Post Office filestore,
© sensitive data held throughout the Horizon system, and

e PINs in PINPads (including PINPad seeding, PIN blocks and PIN block translation in
HSMs.

Key management is also covered. Communications aspects (as distinct from security
functionality) are described in [TED].

Pathway’s inter-campus links, between the Data Centres, are very high-speed (155Mbps)
connections, which gives them a significant level of inherent security. There is, currently, no
suitable encryption hardware capable of operating at this speed, so particularly sensitive data is
protected using Red Pike.

DSA signatures are used to protect the integrity of data on the “TIP link” in both directions.
Verification entails validation of the incoming public key certificate against a CA public key.
The same end-to-end integrity protection is used, where appropriate, to protect other low
volume data such as Post Office Outlet reconciliation totals.

The kilostream links that connect remote operational and support services to the Data
Centres, are protected using commercial encryption or Rambutan based encryption hardware
where this is considered necessary.

All APS data is sent directly to Post Office Ltd. customers using an on site FTMS remote
platform.

The “SM/HSHD links” used, by Fujitsu Core Services, for support and system management, is
protected using Government approved point-to-point encryption devices employing the
Rambutan algorithm.

Links from the Pathway headquarters site to the Pathway campuses also use Government
approved point-to-point encryption devices.

The “Post Office links”, from the Post Office Ltd. Central Services Domain to the Post Offices
Outlets, is protected by use of Virtual Private Networks (VPN), with each member of the
VPN community having a different key pair. VPN also protects the Post Office LAN.

2.7 Message Protection

Message protection, where a digital signature is required, is performed using DSA with a 768
bit modulus. Each DSA signature requires a cryptographically strong random initialisation
value, known as a K-value.

Standard public key technology is used, with Pathway’s “PK certificates” based upon the
X.509 standard. PK certificates contain the public key, the name of the possessor of the
corresponding private key and an expiry date.

Automated Payments are signed in the Post Office Outlets for verification by a central
harvester.

Message protection of data transmitted via the Horizon-NBE link is via Message
Authentication Code (MAC).

2.8 Filestore Encryption in Post Office Outlets

Red Pike, incorporated into the Team Crypto product, is used to protect information held on
hard disks within Post Office Outlets. The NT workstations installed in Post Offices do not
have operable floppy disk drives (since, if fitted, they are physically blanked off and disabled in
the BIOS).

Selected files on Post Office Outlet workstations and gateway machines are automatically
encrypted at disk access level to preserve data confidentiality in the event of the workstation
being stolen.

The Post Office Manager (or authorised representative) is the only person on site who has the
means of unlocking the key to the filestore encryption.

2.9 Administration of Security

Roles have been broadly defined under three category headings, namely Operational, Systems
Management and Support. The Pathway Access Control Policy contains a detailed definition
of roles and responsibilities for all personnel who have any kind of access to the services
provided by Pathway.

Systems management services are based upon three main products, namely Tivoli, HP
OpenView and Patrol. The services provided include:

e Software Distribution - using Tivoli Software Distribution,

e Event Management- using Tivoli Event Console,

« Network Management - using HP OpenView,

¢ Resource Monitoring - using Tivoli Software Distribution, and
e Inventory Management - using Bespoke Inventory.

User management, which is primarily concerned with administration of user accounts and
access controls, uses Riposte and the standard facilities provided for the Sequent, Sun and
Windows NT platforms.

3.0 Security Domains

3.1. Domain Definition

Within this document the term “domain” has been used to describe distinct parts of the system
characterised by:

© type(s) of service provided,
components used (e.g. Oracle, Dynix, NT), and
e area of responsibility (e.g. Pathway, Post Office Ltd.).

The domains, which may be geographically distributed, provide services that are used within
the domain and/or by other domains.

The services offered by several domains combine to provide the end-to-end services, namely
the Post Offices Infrastructure Service(POIS).

These services are defined in the System Architecture Design Document [SADD].

Figure 3.1 Communications Links Between Domains

Figure 3.1 illustrates the primary communications links between the domains. These links,
which are the external connections to the Pathway central sites, are protected to preserve the
integrity and confidentiality of information handled by the system.

There is no special protection required for the OBCS service and ESNCS link, therefore it is
not shown as a separate domain

Specific cryptographic protection is provided on the NB link between the POL Central
Services Domain and the Network Banking Engine (NBE) operated within the POL and POL
Clients Domain.

Where domains encompass two or more geographic locations, the external links between sites
are protected.

The authentication, access control and audit functionality, described in sections 5.0, 6.0 and
7.0, applies to all domains. The crypto functionality and message protection mechanisms,
specified in sections 8.0 and 9.0, have been described for each type of link.

3.2 The Post Office Ltd Central Services Domain

The Post Office Ltd Central Services Domain contains the Horizon application hosts at the
central Pathway sites. These hosts support the Post Office Ltd; APS, EPOSS, LFS, TPS,
Reference Data and OBCS applications.

All applications run on Sequent machines with Oracle databases.

This domain also contains the Network Banking Agents that interface with the Network
Banking Engine (NBE) Domain.

Transaction Management Service (TMS) Agents assemble information from these hosts for
distribution. The Correspondence Servers, which are the central part of the Riposte TMS,
distribute the information to/from the Riposte journals at the Post Offices.

This domain includes the Key Management System used to generate and distribute keys within
the Central Services Domain and to Post Offices.

The Central Service Domain spans two sites that are often referred to as Pathway’s Data
Centres or campuses.

The transaction management facilities provided by Riposte, including the Correspondence
Servers and agents, run on Windows NT platforms.

The Post Office Ltd. Central Services Domain should not be confused with the Transaction
Management Service (TMS). The Post Office Ltd. Central Services Domain is limited to the
central Pathway sites, whilst TMS is defined to include the Riposte components that run on
PCs within the Post Office Outlets.

The Order Book Control Service (OBCS) is, commercially, a Post Office Ltd. service, but
data is exchanged over the unprotected Electronic Stop Notice Control System (ESNCS) link
to the DWP.

The Network Banking Service (NBS) initially supports several On-line counter transaction
types, each being initiated by the presentation of a bank card. Verification is via the use of
PINPads or a visual check of customer signature by the Post Office clerk. There is no
customer verification for deposits. Dedicated NB Agents within the POL Central Service
Domain exchange data with the Network Banking Engine (NBE) over an encrypted link.

3.3 The Office Platform Service Domain

The OPS Domain encompasses all Post Office sites as illustrated in figure 3.2. The
applications, that run on Windows NT workstations, support the:

e Electronic Point of Sale Service (EPOSS) including Debit Card Service (DCS),
e Automated Payment Service (APS),

e Logistics Feeder Service (LFS),

© Order Book Control Service (OBCS) and

e Network Banking Service (NBS).

Reference data, sourced mainly from Post Office Ltd, is distributed to the target applications
in the OPS domain. Validation procedures (specified in section 8.1) and CRC based integrity
checks are incorporated.

Cryptographic mechanisms are used to protect hard disks within the OPS Domain. Filestore
encryption and the associated key management facilities are described in section 10.0.

3.4 Post Office Ltd. and Post Office Ltd. Clients Domain

The Post Office Ltd. and Post Office Ltd. Clients Domain contains the Horizon system
components that provide the interface with Post Office Ltd. and Post Office Ltd. Clients.

Pathway provides Post Office Ltd. Transaction Information Processing (TIP) system with
records of all transactions at Post Office Outlets. The associated Post Office Ltd. system,
which shares the TIP link, provides reference data for the applications.

Post Office Ltd. Automated Payments (APS) system, which processes payments on behalf of
Post Office Ltd. Clients, uses direct links from the Pathway Data Centre to each of the Post
Office Ltd. Client systems.

The Network Banking Engine (NBE) interfaces with the external Banking infrastructure.

3.5 System Management Service Domain

The System Management Service (SMS) Domain contains the central elements of the System
Management (SM) and Network Management System (NMS) facilities.

By their very nature SM and NMS are potentially system wide since all components of the
system need to be managed. It is, however, consistent to include an SMS Domain to identify
the centre of control for SM and NMS.

The Horizon System Help Desk and System Management Centre (SMC) Help Desk are within
the SMS Domain.
3.6 Pathway Corporate Services Domain

The Pathway Corporate Services domain supports Pathways own management processes. The
domain encompasses the Data Warehouse and Pathways managed services as illustrated in

4.2 Operating System Security Functionality

Windows NT is used as the operating system for workstations and most servers.
Pathway also uses two proprietary operating systems based on UNIX:

e Sequent’s Dynix operating system, and

« Sun Microsystems Solaris operating system.

4.2.1 Windows NT Security Functionality
Microsoft’s Windows NT Workstation and Windows NT Server have security functionality
that can be described as ITSEC F-C2 [ITSEC].

4.2.11 Pathway use current stable supported version(s) of Microsoft’s Windows NT
products updated with the appropriate (proven) Microsoft Service Packs.

4.2.2 Dynix Operating System

Sequent’s DYNIX/PTX operating system is an enhanced version of UNIX developed for the
Symmetry series of multiprocessing systems.

Sequent Host Central Servers are used to run the principal business applications and
associated Oracle databases.

Sequent Data Warehouse Servers act as a repository for a large amount of financial and
service-related information, which is used principally for Pathway’s internal business purposes.

4.2.2.1 Pathway use the current version(s) of DYNIX/PTX.

4.2.3 Solaris Operating System
Sun’s Solaris operating system is used on servers in each campus, running HP OpenView and
Cisco Works to manage the Routers, Hubs and other network equipment.

4.2.3.1 Pathway use the latest industry approved version(s) of Sun’s Solaris operating
system.

4.3 Database Management Systems

Oracle V7 and 8i are used to support the databases used by the host applications running on
Sequent servers. Oracle products used include the Oracle Relational Database Management
System and SQL*Net.

43.1.1 Pathway use current version(s) of Oracle products.

4.4 SecurID Tokens and ACE/Server

SecurID tokens from Security Dynamics are used for identification’ authentication of
privileged users, as specified in section 5.1.5.

Appropriate Windows NT workstations include an ACE/Agent that is automatically invoked
during the authentication process to request a password and Personal Identification Number
(PIN) number from the user. The PIN proves that the token belongs to the user.

Similar ACE/Agents are located on Sequent Dynix servers and Sun Solaris servers.

The ACE/Agent sends the password and PIN, suitably obfuscated, to an ACE/Server process

running within the Authentication Server at the campus. This verifies the user’s credentials,

and returns a yes/no indication to the ACE/Agent.

4.5 Network Security

The Horizon solution incorporates five main components for enforcing network security:

e Firewalls (typically Firewall-1),

e Routers (Cisco and Nokia products),

¢ Post Office link components (VPN and ISDN adapter),

e Encryption devices (incorporating Rambutan or other commercial algorithm), and

e Cryptographic services incorporating for example either Red Pike, or DES or 3DES
algorithms.

4.5.1 Firewalls

Firewalls are used to protect the Horizon system from:

e unauthorised access via external networks, and

e other local networks collocated at Pathway sites.

COMMERCIAL IN-CONFIDENCE Date: 12-SEPT-2002

Protection is provided by a combination of packet filtering functionality within router
components and application level firewalls.

Control of access to these components is specified in section 6.7.

For Network Banking and the need to access the Network Banking Engine (NBE), separate
firewalls are introduced. A firewall De-Militarised Zone (DMZ) protects the Pathway
Network Banking Agents from unauthorised access outside of the Data Centres. Two
firewalls are employed and the traffic is ‘Load Balanced’ across them. RADIUS servers are
employed in both Data Centres for Authentication and Accounting for all calls to and from the
Post Office Outlets.

4.5.2 Routers
The routers used are standard Cisco products and Access Servers.

Control of access to these components is specified in section 6.6

4.5.3 Post Office Outlet Link Components (VPN and ISDN Adapters)
This section considers Post Office Outlet links.
Specific security controls include:

e Virtual Private Networks (VPN), across all Post Office Outlet links - as described in
section 8.6 (and also across the outlet LAN as described in section 8.5), and

© Call screening for Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) links - where a list of valid
callers is configured in the central Router and all other calls are rejected. For call screening
(on ISDN links) the list of valid caller information is subject to access controls and
maintained using Tivoli.

e¢ CHAP authentication performed by the RADIUS servers at each Data Centre. The
RADIUS servers, introduced with metered and unmetered (FRIACO) network services for
NB, hold all the CHAP user names and passwords for the live estate

© CLI for inbound calls from Post Office Outlets to the Data Centres.

The use of VPN from Post Office Outlets to the Data Centres is independent of whether the
connection is via the ISDN voice network or the Metered/Un-Metered (FRIACO) data
networks. Data Centre communications with Post Office Outlets for software distribution and
support access, utilise a Post Office Outlet ‘dial back’ to the Data Centre via FRIACO or
RemoteConnect services. This function known as ‘Call Reversal’ is undertaken by CNIM on
the Gateway PC at the Outlet. A reduced ISDN capability is also maintained in order to
provide ‘dial-out’ in the situation where no FRIACO services are available to support existing
Horizon services.

An ISDN adapter is installed in the gateway workstation at every Post Office location that
uses ISDN.

The interface between Windows NT and the adapter is provided by a Network Device
Interface Specification (NDIS) adapter that is supplied by EICON. The NDIS adapter
provides the following security enforcing functionality:

© it only calls phone numbers that exist in the NDIS configuration data,
© it only passes network traffic at the IP level, and
© it protects the NDIS configuration information.

Where satellite is employed at Post Office locations for communications to and from the Data
Centres, the ISDN adapter in the gateway workstation is replaced by a second Ethernet card.
This second Ethernet interface connects via a cross-over cable to the Personal Earth Station
(PES) which is the interface to the satellite Antenna at the Post Office Outlet. The VPN
interface at the Post Office is ‘bound’ to this second Ethernet card as opposed to the ISDN
adapter, thus maintaining full VPN functionality over the satellite link.

4.5.4 Encryption Devices

4.5.4.1 All NDIS configuration data is stored in the Windows NT Registry. Windows NT
access controls and the filestore encryption (described in section 10.0) protects
the files used.

The encryption devices in Pathway’s solution are types ED600RTS and
ED2048R3 supplied by Baltimore Technologies (formerly Zergo).

These devices are Certified products (ITSEC) and provide cryptographic
protection using the CESG designed Rambutan crypto-kernel.

Encryption devices are utilised on Kilostream and Megastream circuits, where
appropriate, to provide link-level encryption.

The use of encryption is specified, on a link by link basis, in section 8.0.
For the NBS, router encryption is operated on the WAN link between Horizon and
the NBE. This utilises commercial algorithms.

4.5.5 Red Pike

Pathway uses a CESG approved implementation of Red Pike to provide the protection of
selected links, as described in section 8.0.

The key management facilities used with Red Pike are implemented and used in accordance
with CESG policy.

The Team Crypto product, used to protect Post Office Outlet filestore, also incorporates Red
Pike, as described in section 10.0.
4.5.6 Commercial Encryption Algorithms.

Pathway uses commercial encryption algorithms (typically 3DES / 1024 bit modulus and RSA
) for some elements of the NBS.

MACs and digital signatures are also employed where appropriate.

4.6 Riposte

Riposte (Retail Integrated Point of Sale Transaction Environment) is a message oriented
middleware product designed to support distributed branch automation.

Riposte provides a 32-bit OLE based application development environment for use with
Windows NT.
4.6.1 Riposte User Authentication

Within the OPS Domain, Riposte is configured to provide user authentication facilities in
conjunction with the underlying Windows NT logon mechanisms. This is particularly useful at
Post Office counters where it is desirable to present an easy to use user interface with minimal
logon overheads.

Riposte is used to provide the Post Office user logon interface as specified in section 5.2.3 and
[TED].
4.6.2 Riposte Messages

Riposte messages are self-describing, have a unique identity and are immutable. Message types
include:

© transactions,

© enquiries and responses,

¢ audit (and monitoring information),

e authorisations,

© session context,

© application reference data, and

e system configuration data.

Messages can contain as much data as is required to describe:
e  Riposte,

e audit information,

© security properties,

© system management information,

e system administration information, and
© application information.

When messages are created, standard message attributes are added by Riposte (including date,
time, user and a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) code). Only Riposte can create messages and
the message store is protected using Windows NT Access Control Lists.

Riposte Servers use Windows NT services for:
© configuration information - stored in the Windows NT Registry,
© error reporting via the Windows NT Event Log, and

e performance monitoring.

4.6.3 Riposte Message Servers

A Riposte Message Server is, typically, a Windows NT workstation or NT Server running the
Riposte services.

A Riposte “group” is a domain in which messages are replicated to a set of message servers,
which are uniquely identified by their Node Ids. A group normally consists of a set of units
that are providing a common service in the same physical location (e.g. a Post Office Outlets).
Riposte provides peer-to-peer message replication that increases the resilience and reliability
of the system. When a message is created, it is first committed in the local message store and
then broadcast to all of the local neighbours. Other Riposte Message Servers, which receive
broadcast messages, store them in local message stores, then forward them to other local
neighbours who have not been sent the message. In this way, messages are propagated to all
members of the group.

Message synchronisation is achieved using “marker” messages that are exchanged between
Message Servers. This allows any messages, which may be lost or missing from its local
message store, to be requested. The activity, which normally takes place across the LAN, is
totally transparent to Riposte applications.

If a message store is lost, all messages are recovered from other members of the group. For a
single terminal outlet, a dual disk configuration is used with fallback to the associated
correspondence servers at the central site to provide secondary backup.

4.6.4 Riposte Correspondence Servers

A Correspondence Server is a Riposte message server that is a member of more than one
group.

Correspondence Servers are used to provide:

© access to central systems,

© office backup and recovery, and

© distributed group extension.

4.6.5 Riposte Agents

Riposte Agents provide a service to a Riposte application or group of applications. They are
also used to provide an interface between Riposte messaging environments and external
systems.

Examples of how the Horizon system uses Riposte Agents include:
© transaction harvesting, and
¢  Riposte related system management activities.

The Riposte Agents used with Windows NT are multi-threading and use the NT event logging
interfaces. They are configured to run as background processes that either run on demand or
automatically as system services when the system is booted.

The type of each message defines the action to be taken by the Agent upon message receipt.
The action(s) taken may:

© interact with an external system,

¢ retrieve information from the message store,

© update internal (volatile) state,

© update persistent state in the message store, and
© write response message(s).

When Agents are restarted, they co-ordinate recovery with external systems and restore their
state information. Restart is automated by the System Management Components (described in
section 13.2). Recovery includes processing messages that may have arrived when the Agent
was down.

The use of Riposte Agents with Post Office Ltd. Clients, APS host(s) and TIP host(s) is
illustrated in figure 3.2.
4.6.6 Riposte Communications

Riposte has a Remote Procedure Call (RPC) interface that may be called from any DCE
compliant RPC implementation. This enables applications on other platforms (e.g. UNIX or
Sequent’s Dynix) to be integrated.

Riposte communications are based on a connectionless, best-effort messaging model.

The User Datagram Protocol and Internet Protocol (UDP/IP) are used to provide high
performance communications. The Sockets implementation of UDP/IP, provided by Windows
NT, is used

4.6.7 Riposte Desktop

Each Riposte user application:

e runs (Desktop.EXE) on a Windows NT Workstation,

© contains and manages Riposte visual components,

e is integrated with RetailBroker, Peripheral, Validate, and TRState,

e provides session mobility (with stateless applications), and

e has a modular structure (using DLLs for each application).

The Riposte Desktop System incorporates several Dynamic Link Libraries (DLL) that are
used for:

© transactions and Riposte services (RetailBroker.DLL),
© session mobility and logon/logoff (TRState.DLL),

© peripheral device handling (Peripheral.DLL), and

© input validation (Validate.DLL).

4.7 Virus Protection

This section considers the threat of virus infection and identifies the components needed to
provide an appropriate level of protection. Viruses in this context includes all malicious
software including network worms, logic bombs and Trojan horses.

4.7.1 Threat of Virus Infection

The threat of virus infection in most parts of the Horizon system is relatively low since:

¢ tightly controlled Windows NT configurations are used throughout the Office Platform
Service Domain,

e floppy disk drives cannot be used within Post Offices,
e there are no E-mail connections to external systems,

e MS Office documents (including any documents/files that could contain macro virus) are
not normally imported,

© operational files transmitted by file transfer contain data rather than executable code, and
© the main processing platforms are Unix based.

There is, however, a need to protect against the introduction of viruses from the following
external sources:

© executable files introduced for maintenance purposes, and

© HTML documents containing user Help information.

4.7.2 Virus Protection Measures

Virus protection relies upon adherence to the security procedures defined in [SECPRO] and
the measures supported by the Horizon system.

4.7.2.1 All workstations running Windows, except those within the Office Platform
Service Domain, have virus protection software installed.

4.7.2.2 All workstations used to import executable code, destined for any Windows
platform, have virus protection software installed.

4.7.2.3. The “import” of executable code shall normally be from external sources (e.g.
floppy disk) into the System Management Service Domain. This enables virus
checked software to be distributed throughout the Horizon system (e.g. to PCs
located in Post Offices) over the network without requiring the recipient PCs
to run further virus checks.

4.7.2.4 All executable code is virus checked prior to being imported into any part of the
Horizon system.

4.7.2.5. All files susceptible to macro or related viruses (including HTML files), for which
virus checks are feasible, are checked for viruses prior to being imported into
any part of the Horizon system, by whatever route.

4.7.2.6 Anti-virus software is maintained by installing current upgrades, as they become
available.

4.7.2.7 Selected workstations are fitted with logical and/or physical floppy drive locking
mechanisms to prevent the unauthorised physical introduction of malicious
software.

4.7.2.8 Protection is enhanced and extended for NBS with the installation and appropriate
configuration of NBS-dedicated firewalls at the interface between the NBE and
each Data Centre.

4.7.2.9 As an additional safeguard, Pathway ensures that the Horizon system has adequate
facilities for recovery in the event of a virus being detected.

4.8 MS SQL Server 2000

MS SQL Server 2000 runs on NT Servers and is accessed from clients running on NT
Workstations. MS SQL Server 2000 has three modes of Authentication, namely Standard,
Mix, and NT Authentication. The NT Authentication mode should be used.

4.9 Web Servers

The http protocol is used for Web Servers, this allows access to text usually in HTML format.
Basic authentication is defined within the http protocol, however the user id and password are
only encoded using Base64 encoding, this can easily be converted back to plain text, the
authentication information is sent as part of the request every time a GET request is sent to
the Web Server. All traffic to and from Web Server is text, where binary data is transferred
this is Base64 encoded to produce a text string. The traffic between the Web Client and Web
Server can be encrypted using SSL (https protocol).

The Web Server used in accessing the SMDB and OMDB databases is Oracle Web Server
version 1.0.2 this does not support SSL.

4.10 Business Objects

Business Objects is an OLAP reporting tool that is used both for producing standard and ad-
hoc reports from the Data Warehouse and from OCMS databases.

Business Objects includes security functionality allowing the grouping of Business Objects
Users, however this is dependent on the information being stored in the repository. Business
Objects Users may be assigned passwords, in order to allow the user to change the password,
that user requires update access to the table containing the password, which contains all the
other user’s passwords.

4.10.1.1 I Business Objects should not be relied upon to provide security and access controls
alone. Use within Horizon is limited to specific authorised users and supported
by NT access controls.

views.
4.10.3 Business Objects and MS SQL Server databases

MS SQL Server should be configured to use integrated security (NT Authentication).
Business Objects allows not only access to defined reports but also allow users to select other
databases, and execute SQL commands on those databases.

MS SQL Databases should not rely on the front application to provide security.

5.0 Identification and Authentication

5.1. Identification and Authentication Requirements

Identification and authentication mechanisms are required to ensure that all users are uniquely
identified, with only authorised users being granted any access to the system.

Reliable identification and authentication is essential in order to:

© provide the basis for access control decisions, and

e ensure that all users are individually accountable for their actions.

Authentication is based upon the information received, so the Horizon system protects both:
© the collection of authentication data, and

* the transmission of authentication data.

Particular attention is focused upon users situated in any remote location because these can
represent higher risks to the system.

5.1.1 User Identification

Identification is the means by which the user provides their identity to the system. This can be
based upon a combination of what the user knows (a User Id), what the user possesses (a
smart card or other token) or some biometrics characteristic of the user.

5.1.1.1 All users are allocated an identifier (User Id) by which they are known to the
system.

User Ids shall be unique within the scope of that part of the system. For example,
the Post Office Manager would set up and maintain the User Id information for
each counter clerk within that Post Office, using the Riposte application interfaces
provided.

5.1.1.2. An individual’s User id is sufficient to trace the identity of the person who has been
authenticated.

In exceptional cases, where the same User id is used for infrequent access by users
in particular roles, additional information is recorded to maintain traceability. This
applies, for example, to Post Office Ltd. Auditors who are required to authenticate
with the Help Desk before getting a one-shot password.

5.1.1.3. The Horizon system does not allow (normal) users to change their User Id.

The aim is to ensure that “users” remain individually accountable. It is, however,
recognised that for very privileged users this might be difficult (or unrealistic) for
the system to enforce. Procedural rules and auditing are used to provide additional
controls that support this objective.

5.1.1.4 The format of User Ids depends upon the platform(s) used and the server used for
authentication.

5.1.1.5

5.1.1.6

5.1.2

In all cases, the procedures used by Pathway [SECPRO] provide guidelines to
cover operational aspects, including:

e the allocation of User Ids to individuals,
¢ selective removal of User Ids from the system, and

© constraints on re-allocation of User Ids to other personnel.

The system distinguishes between identification information (User Ids) and
authentication data (including passwords).

The security of the system does not rely upon the secrecy of any User Id
information.

User Authentication

Authentication is concerned with establishing the validity of the user’s claimed identity. It
increases confidence that the claimed identity is the right one for the user.

5.1.2.1 All users are authenticated before any access is granted to the Horizon system.
Human users, therefore, complete the logon sequence before they are able to
invoke any other actions.
5.1.2.2. Users are allowed a predetermined number of attempts to logon, as specified in
[ACCPOL]. After this number is exceeded the user’s logon facility is disabled.
Other action taken upon failure to logon are configurable from the following
options:
e an alarm message shall be raised,
¢ logon failure will be recorded in the audit track, and
¢ an application level audit message will be generated.
In all cases the logon failure will be recorded.
5.1.2.3. Following logon failure, the user’s logon facility will be reset by:
© positive action by the system manager, or
¢ expiry of a timeout period.
The optional timeout facility will only be available within the Office Platform
Service Domain. The configuration of this facility, including the time between
retries, is specified in [ACCPOL]
5.1.2.4 During logon, the responses provided by the system to the user shall be simple
messages reporting success or failure. No reason is given in the event of logon
failure.
5.1.2.5. On successful logon, the system displays the date and time of the user’s last
successful logon at Post Office outlets.

5.1.3

Within each Post Office Outlet, users will not be able to run more than one counter
PC with the same user identity.

A subsequent logon at a second PC will cause Riposte to terminate the users
previous session and transfer use to the new counter position.

Passwords

Human users and system/process users use passwords. This section defines the requirements
for all passwords, whilst the additional requirements specified in section 5.1.4 apply only to
passwords used by human users.

5.1.4

The Horizon system is not required to provide automated generation of passwords.
The format of passwords depends upon the platform(s) used and the server used
for authentication.

In all cases, the procedures used by Pathway [SECPRO] provides guidelines on the
use of passwords, including:

e the allocation of new passwords,
¢ appropriate choice of replacement passwords,
e the need to avoid disclosure of passwords, and

e the frequency and timing of password changes.

The system uses volatile memory for operations associated with password
checking. For Pathway specific code, when the checking is completed all “in
clear” password information is overwritten.

Ideally, all “in clear” password information should be overwritten after use but the
use of COTS products and standard applications may dictate that this can not be
achieved or verified.

Passwords will never be visibly displayed by the system.

Passwords will not be transmitted “in the clear” to or from any location outside the
central Pathway sites unless they are one-shot passwords.

Passwords will not be transmitted “in the clear” within Pathway sites unless the
link used is entirely within a physically protected area (e.g. Campus sites) and a
risk assessment has indicated that the residual risk is acceptable.

All Routers are configured in the mode that ensures that password information is
stored in encrypted format.

Human User Passwords

The requirements specified in this section apply only to passwords used by human users.

5.1.4.3

5.1.4.4

5.1.4.5

5.1.4.6

5.1.5

An initial password is made known to each individual. The system marks these
initial passwords as expired.

As this password is known by more than one person, the user is forced to change
the initial password before other options can be selected. This mechanism also
applies to any passwords reset by a third party.

An appropriate one-way algorithm is used to encrypt password information used
by human users, before storage or transmission.

All users have the ability to change their own password (without requiring
intervention from a supervisor or Post Office Manager).

Password change interfaces are expected to depend upon platform type (e.g. Dynix
and Windows NT will differ) but in all cases the user will complete the logon
sequence before initiating a password change. The change sequence will also
require the old password to be correctly quoted.

The OPS provides facilities to enable the Post Office Manager to establish new
users and set an initial password for each user in their Post Office.

If a user forgets their password the Post Office Manager is able to reset the
password.

For situations where the sole user (e.g. Post Office Manager in a single counter
office) has forgotten his password, a secure backup procedure is used.

Use of Tokens

The Horizon system only use tokens when the protection provided by passwords alone is not
considered to be sufficient. In general, token use is limited to system management personnel
and management operations conducted from or on remote sites, as defined in [ACCPOL].

5.1.5.1 Tokens are allocated to named individuals for their sole use.
In certain circumstances (e.g. fourth line support,) a card may be “assigned” to an
individual for a limited period. In such cases, a full audit trail of such cards is
retained.
5.1.5.2 The identity of users who have been issued with tokens is made known to the
system and the authentication processes enforce their use.
5.1.5.3. The system is capable of selectively revoking the validity of tokens.
5.1.5.4 Smart tokens are used in all cases where a password alone is not considered to be
sufficient. The user is obliged to prove that he/she possesses the token at the
time of logon.

activate the device, as defined in [ACCPOL].

5.1.5.6 Personnel who are authorised to access the Horizon system from remote locations
are required to identify themselves using hand held tokens.

This group comprises selected system administrators authorised to use remote
access for system management activities.

The Pathway Headquarters site is categorised as being a “remote location”.
Pathway personnel who require access to the operational system and/or Data
Warehouse are required to use tokens.

5.1.5.7 Personnel who are authorised to access the Horizon system using UNIX root
privilege are required to identify themselves using hand held tokens.

5.1.5.8 Personnel who are authorised to access the Horizon system as a database
administrator (DBA) are required to identify themselves using hand held
tokens.

5.2 Authentication of Windows NT Users

5.2.1 Authentication Methods

Windows NT [WINNT] is used as the base operating system for:

e platforms within the Post Office Ltd. Central Services Domain,

e workstations within the Office Platform Service Domain, and

* servers within the Post Office Ltd. and Post Office Ltd. Clients Domain.

The standard Windows NT logon mechanisms (outlined in section 5.2.2) is used for users in
all domains listed above, except the Office Platform Service (OPS) Domain. Users in the OPS
Domain, which includes all Post Office staff, use a simpler interface provided using Riposte
(as described in section 5.2.3).

In both cases:
5.2.1.1 Information used to authenticate users is protected by the authentication
mechanisms used.

5.2.1.2 All users are named individuals with their own password.

All account information associated with Guests are disabled or, where possible,
removed entirely.

Figure 5.2

Logon Sequence at Post Offices

The logon sequence used is illustrated in figure 5.2. For simplicity, filestore encryption logic
(described in section 10.0) associated with initial power up is not shown.

When the Windows NT workstation is powered up, the Windows NT facility for automatic
logon is initiated instead of the normal manual NT user logon sequence. This enables a dummy
user with username (ul) and password (pl). The first security check is then forced by
automatic entry into a Post Office Manager’s (POM’s) authentication protocol, which requires
the POM to authenticate using his/her Memory Card and associated PIN in order to continue
the boot up sequence and unlock encrypted filestore.

5.2.1.2

Facilities that enable the automatic logon to be bypassed, to give access to a
standard Windows NT logon, is disabled.

In particular, the booting of Windows NT is not interruptible.

On completion of the automatic logon, the Desktop process is entered
automatically. Once the Desktop process has completed loading and Initialisation,
the Desktop displays a User logon form.

This Desktop user logon is integrated with Windows NT. A successful logon
requires the username and a one way hash of the password to be valid within both
Riposte and Windows NT.

Once the Desktop user logon has been completed successfully, the user can
execute applications within the Desktop.

It is important to note that the Desktop process runs within the security context of
user ul. However, the Desktop process does not access files directly, but acts as a
Client to the Riposte service that is running under a privileged user u3. When the
Desktop calls on the Riposte service to perform a function (such as write a
message to the Riposte message store), the Riposte service ‘impersonates’
username u2, the Desktop username (provided by the real user).

Impersonate is an NT term defined in the Microsoft Developer Studio, Visual C ++
version 4.2 as:

“Impersonation is the ability of a thread to execute in a security context different

from that of the process that owns the thread. Typically, a thread in a server

application impersonates a client. This allows the server thread to act on behalf of
that client to access objects or validate access to its own objects.”

When the user logs off from the desktop, the desktop logon form is displayed
whilst the desktop remains active in the security context of username ul. This
allows the Post Office user to subsequently logon without incurring the delay
arising from loading the desktop.

5.3.1.3. Database access from the Post Office Ltd. Central Services Domain is provided by
Riposte Agents running on Windows NT. Each agent is associated with a Port
(or multiple Ports) on the Sequent machine.

The default IP port for SQL*Net connects to Sequent. Normal Oracle
id/password/role authentication applies.

5.3.1.4 The database authentication is supplemented when client applications are used,
adding password ageing and maintenance.

5.4 Authentication of Post Office Ltd. Staff

Mechanisms are provided to enable the Post Office Manager to verify his/her identity when
making requests to the appropriate Help Desks. This ensures that significant requests,
including all changes to the system, are only accepted from authorised personnel.

The mechanisms needed to authenticate Post Office Ltd staff are described in the respective
Help Desk Processes and Procedures Description (PPD). Horizon representatives have agreed
these PPD documents.

5.5 Authentication of MS SQL Server Users

authenticate a second time, Windows NT using the users existing credentials handles this
authentication seamlessly.

6.0 Logical Access Control

6.1 Access Control Requirements
There are three aspects to access control:
e Authorisation - determining which subjects are entitled to have access to which objects,

e Access rights - determining the combination of access modes permitted (e.g. read, write,
execute and delete), and

e Enforcement - of the access rights.

This Security Functional Specification considers the access rights that are supported by system
components and the ability of the system to enforce access rights. The topic of authorisation
and assignment of rights to individuals is addressed in the Access Control Policy [ACCPOL].
6.1.1 Access Control Policy

Pathway’s Access Control Policy identifies all users who are authorised to access any part of
the system and the access rights permitted.

For practical reasons, the Access Control Policy is expressed in terms of roles rather than
named individuals. All users are associated with one or more roles so that all persons are
individually accountable for their actions.

6.1.1.1 Pathway’s Access Control Policy identifies all roles associated with the system and
defines the access rights that are to be granted to each user acting in that role.
6.1.2 Privileges and Roles

Users of the operational Horizon system carry out their duties in a variety of roles, including
system administrator, database administrator, help desk advisor, Post Office counter clerk and
maintenance engineer.

Users require certain privileges in order to perform their allotted tasks. The privileges
associated with each role will, therefore, be sufficient to allow all tasks associated with that
role to be performed whilst not providing any additional capabilities.

6.1.2.1 Pathway applies the principle of least privilege when assigning privileges to roles
and users.

6.1.3 Separation of Duty Controls

Separation of duty controls is based upon Roles as defined in [ACCPOL].

Administrative and procedural controls are also defined within Pathway operational

procedures.

6.1.4 I Two Person Controls

Two person controls have been considered for system and database management operations
but are not employed. They are however used extensively in key management.

6.1.5 Use of Discretionary Access Controls

Discretionary Access Controls (DAC) are used to provide resource owners with the ability to
specify who can access their resources and the type of access permitted.

6.1.6 Control of Access to Files and Directories

Access to each file or directory is controlled by the owner of the object who is able to grant
access rights to other users or groups of users. The types of access supported normally include
Read, Write, Execute and Delete.

6.2 Control of Access to Databases

The three main ways of controlling access to the Oracle database facilities are by:
¢ being selective about the choice of potential users,

e ensuring that user authentication is effective, and

e defining profiles that limit the use of system resources.

6.2.1 Schemas and Users

Each Oracle database has a list of schemas that define collections of schema objects (including
tables, views, clusters, and procedures).

Each Oracle database also have a list of valid database users. These users are permitted to
access the database by running a database application (such as Oracle Forms, SQL*Plus, a
precompiler etc) and connect to the database using a valid username defined in the database.

When a database user is created, a corresponding schema of the same name is created for the
user. This schema defines the objects that may be accessed by the user, unless otherwise
constrained.

Access rights of a user are determined by the security administrator who sets up the user’s
domain. These parameters specify:

e whether user authentication information is maintained by the database or the operating
system (see section 5.3),

© resource limits, defined in a profile (see section 6.2.3), and

© the privileges and roles (see section 6.2.4) that provide the user with appropriate access to
objects needed to perform database operations.

6.2.2 Changing User’s Parameters

A user’s security domain can be altered using:

e Oracle’s Server Manager, and/or

e the SQL command ALTER USER.

Users are permitted to use these facilities to change their own password but other operations,
which require additional privilege, can only be performed by the security administrator.

6.2.3 Profiles

The allocation of resource limits (e.g. CPU time) to individual database users is simplified by
use of the default profiles. Limits found to be necessary are defined as the default wherever
possible.

6.2.4 Oracle Privileges and Roles

The Oracle Database Administrator’s Guide [ORACLE], which includes a lengthy section on
Privileges and Roles, describes:

e system and object privileges,

e database roles,

e how to grant and revoke privileges and roles,
e how to create, alter, and drop roles, and

¢ how role use can be controlled.

A privilege is a right to execute a particular type of SQL statement or access to another user’s
object. It can be granted to users explicitly or can be granted to a role (as a named group of
privileges) that are then granted to one or more users.

Within the Horizon system all privileges are associated with roles rather than being explicitly
assigned to individual users. This provides more effective management control of both system
privileges and object privileges.

6.2.5 MS SQL 2000 Privileges and Roles

The MS SQL Books provide details of Privileges and Roles.

The MS SQL Security Manager is used to administrate the NT Groups that can access MS
SQL Server 2000.

The MS SQL Server Enterprise Manager, provides a GUI interface which can use used to
assigned User/Group permissions to individual databases, tables, Views, columns, stored
procedures and/or Triggers.
6.2.1.1 All demonstration databases should be removed.
The pubs database is always installed when MS SQL is installed, and allows guest
user access.

6.2.1.2 The NT ‘Everyone’ group should not be granted database access.

6.2.1.3. The KMA is configured so that DB Admin and System Admin are kept separate.

6.3 Access Controls Supported by Windows NT

The following subsections identify the main access control facilities provided by Windows NT.

The security functionality provided by the base Windows NT products is sufficient to meet the
access control requirements on all NT Workstations and NT Servers within the Horizon
system.

6.3.1 Configuration of Windows NT

Configuring Windows NT platforms to provide secure operation is quite complex. The
underlying mechanisms are sound but the products, as supplied by Microsoft, have default
settings that permit Guest users and do not adequately constrain access to objects.

Configuring each platform, in accordance with [ACCPOL] (see section 6.1.1), is essential.

6.3.1.1 Windows NT based platforms are configured strictly in accordance with
[ACCPOL] prior to their installation.
6.3.2 Windows NT Access Control Lists

Windows NT [WINNT] supports Access Control Lists (ACLs) that identify the resource
access permissions granted to users and groups.

6.3.2.1 Windows NT Access Control Lists are used to define permitted access to objects
in accordance with [ACCPOL].

Wherever possible, ACLs will be defined in terms of roles rather than individuals to
simplify system configuration.

6.3.3 Windows NT Tools Used to Control Access

Windows NT supports a number of tools that can be used to control access to resources (e.g.
File Manager and Print Manager).

6.3.3.1 The ability to access Windows NT tools has been removed on the basis of roles, in
accordance with [ACCPOL], prior to installation.

6.3.4 Windows NT File and Directory Access

The types of access associated with files and directories have been outlined, in general terms,
in section 6.1.6

Appendix A explains how each type of access is interpreted in terms of Windows NT files and
directories.

6.6 Control of Access to Routers

6.6.1 Access Methods
Cisco provides four methods of access for controlling routers:

© Console access - using a terminal attached directly to the Router via a “control port” on
the back,

e Telnet access - using a Telnet, run over IP, to provide a remote login,

e Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) access - using the SNMP protocol to
configure the router and collect information, and

e Indirect - using the Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) to download configuration files
from a configuration server.

6.6.1.1 I Console access mode is not disabled by router configuration. In normal running,
however, the routers will not have consoles attached.

6.6.1.2. Telnet access will only be permitted in exceptional cases, where more direct access
to the routers is essential, as defined in [ACCPOL].
The Terminal Access Controller Access Control System (TACACS+) is used to
authenticate all telnet users. Their actions are audited at the NMS.

6.6.1.3. SNMP access is used for remote system management of routers (as outlined in
section 13.3.3)

6.6.1.4 Use of TFTP is controlled.

6.6.2 Privileged Mode Access

Provided that Console or SNMP mode of access is used (as defined in section 6.6.1) the use of
privileged mode access can be controlled as follows:

e For a given user (or group of users), non-privileged and privileged access can be
permitted. Non-privileged access allows users to monitor the Router but not configure the
Router. Privileged mode allows the user to fully configure the Router.

e The access mode is enabled for Console access by setting up two types of password. The
logon password allows non-privileged access to the Router. The user enters privileged
mode by use of the enable command and an additional password.

e With SNMP access different community strings are used to distinguish between non-
privileged and privileged access modes. Non-privileged access allows a host to send the
Router SNMP get_request and SNMP get_next_request messages. Privileged mode
allows the host to send the Router SNP set_request messages in order to change the
Router’s configuration and operational state.

6.6.2.1 Session Timeout values are selected to limit the period of time allowed for
operation of a console in privileged mode.

6.6.3 Access Lists

Access List perimeters allow IP addresses to be specified along with protocols (IP, UDP, TCP
and ICMP) and port numbers.

6.6.3.1 Access lists are used to define the actual traffic that is permitted or denied through
a Router.

6.6.3.2 Only traffic associated with IP addresses that are explicitly defined in Access Lists
are permitted.

6.6.3.3 Constraints associated with particular port numbers are defined as part of the
network design.

6.6.3.4 Constraints associated with particular protocols are defined as part of the network
design.

Access lists can be applied to specific interfaces and they can be used to filter packets before
or after routing decisions are made. The use of input access lists can prevent specific address
spoofing scenarios whereas use of output access lists only does not.

6.6.3.5 Input access lists are used to ensure that filtering is enforced before routing
decisions are made. Outlet filtering is also used to ensure that valid Pathway
packets are not exposed (to say TIP etc) when the same router is shared.

6.7 Control of Access to Firewalls

Firewalls are used to protect the Horizon system from unauthorised access via external
networks and other local networks collocated at Pathway sites. Access Methods

Pathway firewalls are managed using Firewall Enterprise Centres, one at each Data Centre, as
described in [ACCPOL]. These reside on Sun Solaris systems which provides access controls
as specified in section 6.5.2.

6.7.1.1 All access to the firewalls is via the Enterprise Centre, except for hardware
maintenance.

6.7.1.2 As for routers, firewalls should not have consoles attached, except for hardware
maintenance purposes.

All VPN access control features are configured in accordance with [ACCPOL].

6.9 Web Server Access Controls

The Web Server runs under its own user id, there is the potential for the Web Browser to
cause the execution of programs under this user id. Access Control should be used to limit this
user id’s access to the rest of the platform, preferably denying access.

6.9.1 Web Server documents

be placed in a separate area from other files.

6.9.1.2 Only read access should be granted to Web Server document files by the Web

IIS.

These scripts or programs are executed either under the user id of the Web Server or in some
cases the user’s id.

6.9.4 Oracle Web Server 1.02 Access Controls

The Oracle Web Server is used to access the Oracle RDMBS, using a CGI program. There are
no further specific access controls required.

6.10 External Support Access Controls

Specific controls apply in respect of external support of Horizon systems for diagnostic and
maintenance purposes (e.g. by EMC, Sequent and Oracle). All requests for technical support
are made via the HSHD and callers validated as defined in [ACCPOL]. Subsequent support is
generally undertaken on site. All visitors are subject to identity validation and must be
accompanied.

Where site visits are impractical (e.g. because of the urgency of the required diagnosis),
remote access may be permitted subject to compliance with agreed network and procedural
controls. These include:

© permitting access only by authorised staff from secure support outlets/environments;

© permitting access only by dedicated support client or link utilising authentication
mechanisms to maintain confidentiality and integrity of the connection;

e changing relevant passwords and disallowing permitted access configurations after use;

¢ auditing all access and subsequent maintenance / support activities.

7.0 Audit and Alarms

7.1. Audit and Alarm Requirements

The audit and alarm facilities provided by the Horizon system must satisfy the business level
audit and security audit requirements of “external” auditors (including Post Office Ltd. and
NAO) and the Post Office Ltd. and Pathway’s “internal” monitoring (including Security
Audit).

The Audit Trail Functional Specification [AUDFS], which is primarily concerned with
addressing business level audit requirements, specifies audit trails as one or more “tracks” that
can be selectively viewed by the appropriate auditors.

7.2 Sources of Audit Events

Auditable events are recorded in application level transaction logs and lower level audit
tracks’. Figure 7.1 illustrates the main sources of system generated events.

Figure 7.1 Sources of Auditable Events

Riposte provides an ideal basis for logging all transactions to give a complete picture of
actions within the Post Office Outlets Infrastructure Service. It is used within the Post Office
Ltd Central Services and OPS Domains to provide a complete record of all transactions.

Applications running on the Sequent servers generate logs of the business transactions and file
transfers. The Oracle databases, used for the Data Warehouse and MIS, have the ability to
audit security relevant events that are recorded in tables.

Patrols used to monitor all Sequent systems and the Oracle applications that run on Sequent
platforms. The audit events and alarms gathered by Patrol are captured, for recording and
analysis, via a Patrol Tivoli event adapter (as outlined in section 13.0).

? An “audit track” is a record of activities made within a subsystem for one or more of its interfaces (as defined
in [AUDFS] ).

COS Manager generates the main system level log on the Sequent servers. All users logging
onto Sequent at the operating system level (for system administration, security management
etc) will invoke COS Manager, which records their logon and subsequent actions selected
from its menus.

Windows NT can provide essentially the same audit capability for both workstations and
servers. These facilities are powerful but need to be used with caution to avoid generating vast
quantities of low level events, which are difficult to analyse in a business context. Selective
filtering is used to reduce the volume of events to be gathered, analysed and stored.

Tivoli is used to monitor selected Windows NT logs regularly and picks up agreed event types
for transmission to the Data Centre as Tivoli events.

Wherever possible, application/middleware level auditing are used. Low level Windows NT
audit tracks will, however, provide appropriate facilities for auditing system management
activity across the system.

7.3 Auditable Events

7.3.1.1 Allevents in the following categories are capable of being audited:
e authentication actions (including logon, unsuccessful logon attempts and logoff),
* exception conditions (detected by operating systems and at the application level),
© system start-up,
e change of user rights (including granting of additional privileges),
write access to selected files,
system management activities (including addition of new users and reset of any
user’s password).
7.3.1.2 Where there are multiple mechanisms capable of recording a particular event,
duplication is avoided and the most appropriate audit method is used.

For example, within the OPS Domain, activities at Post Office Outlet counters are
recorded in the TMS journal rather than the lower level NT event logs. Similarly,
within the Post Office Ltd Central Services Domain, Tivoli is used to gather events
for central analysis.

7.4 Application Level Audit

all exception conditions (e.g. file sequence or control total failures).

Riposte Transaction Log

All transactions that pass through TMS are recorded in the journal. The journal is maintained
on magnetic media within TMS for a period of (typically) 90 days. Following this, the journal
data is archived to long term storage. The current or archived TMS journals can be accessed
to provide an audit track of all TMS transactions.

7.4.2.2

7.4.2.3

For transactional-based data transfers, logging is provided at the message level.

All data captured at a Post Office counter, either as part of a counter transaction
(i.e. Stamp sale) or as an administration function (user log-on, teller balance),
forms part of a unique transaction that is given a unique reference number by
Riposte.

The format of this journal entry varies according to the transaction type, [TED] but
typically contains:

Post Office ID,
Counter Position ID,
Unique Transaction ID,
Date,

Time,

User ID,

Application, and

Transaction Details.

7.4.2.4 Each counter PC contains a journal and all journal entries shall be automatically
replicated to all other members of the workgroup. This includes remote
Correspondence Servers that form part of the TMS.

7.4.2.5 This Correspondence Server in turn replicate all its transactions to other
Correspondence Servers located on different sites.

7.4.2.6 A complete audit track of all transactions and other significant events are
maintained for the Post Office Counter systems, as specified in [AUDFS]. It
can be extracted, when needed, for analysis.

7.4.2.7 All events that occur either in TMS or in OPS are written to a journal. The journal
message content is identified in section 7.4.2.3.

7.4.3.2 The integrity of the audit track is maintained during periods of partial or complete
service loss or failure. Starting and restarting transactions will make
appropriate audit track entries.

7.4.3.3 The distributed nature of the Pathway TMS enables an audit track to be maintained
and accessed during any recovery of a TMS server.

7.5 Application Level Audit Analysis

The tool set used to support audit analysis is expected to evolve as experience is gained in
analysis of the various logs. The basic tools include facilities to selectively read:

e TMS journals,

e Tivoli event data,

e Oracle database information (e.g. using Oracle forms),

e Windows NT event logs (for exceptional investigations), and

© any other sources of audit information.

The output generated by these tools is a combination of standard reports and ad hoc enquiries.
As the tools develop, the ease of use and format consistency of the information reported is
expected to improve.

75.1 Standard reports include all exception events (e.g. sequence or control total
failures), plus daily/weekly/monthly control summaries.

7.6 Protection of Audit Tracks

7.6.1.1 The audit track has a level of security such that it cannot be altered or deleted.

The journals are written as append-only files, owned at the system level and
protected by the subsystem’s access control.

7.6.1.2 Pathway keeps copies of vital files, including the audit track, at the alternate
central site or off site. The frequency of transferring backup copies is defined in
[ACCPOL].

7.7 Audit of Systems Management Functions

The Systems Management function provides the audit track with a record of operational
events, inventory, distribution and remote operations.

7.7.1.1. The Systems Management Service provides a repository for recording all physical
events affecting the platforms that support TMS and the OPS.

All these environments operate under Windows NT and are managed from the
Tivoli SMS server. The Tivoli SMS provides, in conjunction with the native
Windows NT and messaging middleware services, a comprehensive facility for

trapping, recording and interrogating audit events relating to the operational status
of the hardware, software and applications.

The Tivoli notification features and Windows NT auditing support the recording of
events such as which users access which objects, what type of access is being
attempted and whether or not the attempt was successful.

Logging facilities supported by HP OpenView are used provide a record of
network management actions.

An OpenView Tivoli event adapter is used to map SNMP traps into the central

Tivoli Event server.

Administrative privilege is required for controlling audit and auditing policies
within the Windows NT Registry.

Audit events are viewed through the appropriate audit analysis applications.

Replacement or modification of selected files containing security critical code is
audited.

In particular, attempts to update or delete modules concerned with integrity
checking and crypto functionality shall be monitored.

7.8 Windows NT Audit

This section provides an overview of the audit facilities provided by Windows NT. It should
be noted, however, that Tivoli is used on all NT platforms to provide central event
management services derived from the local mechanisms.

The local audit facility collects audit records from several components (including Riposte and
local applications) in addition to recording its own NT system events. Tivoli then picks up the
NT logs selecting the event to be collected according to the filtering criteria.

8.1 TPS to OPTIP and Reference Data to RDS Link

These are the links used to transfer information to/from Post Office Ltd. They carry the
entirety of Post Office Ltd’s outlet transaction business and stock data, plus reference data
back to Pathway via a FTMS gateway service. There is an explicit requirement from Post
Office Ltd. for integrity protection of this link, in addition to the end-to-end protection of APS
records, as defined in section 9.3.

8.1.1 Protection

8.1.1.1 DSA signatures are used to protect the integrity of data transferred on this link in
both directions. This protection is also provided for traffic to and from the
disaster recovery site.

8.1.1.2 Verification is done by validating the incoming public key certificate against a CA
public key using a pre-installed key stock at the receiving PC, then validating
the file’s signature using the public key in the certificate.

8.1.1.3. The same end-to-end integrity protection is used, where appropriate, to protect
other low volume data such as Post Office Outlet reconciliation totals.

8.1.2 Key Management

8.1.2.1 The private signing key is managed in two parts that must be combined before
either part is of any value.

8.1.2.2. Key distribution is effected by transmitting one of the parts electronically and the
other by diskette. The part sent electronically is held on filestore. At each
system start-up, the diskette part is introduced by the key custodian or key
handler and combined with the filestore part to create the key in memory.

8.1.2.3. The full key will not be stored persistently on a disk file.
8.1.2.4 Each end of the link has a different signing key.

8.1.2.5 The keys are changed at intervals agreed with Post Office Ltd, based on advice
from CESG.

8.2 Post Office Ltd HAPS Link - decommissioned

The HAPS system has been decommissioned. This section has been retained to keep
references to this document fixed.

8.3 Post Office Ltd. APS Client Links

8.3.1.1 Files transferred on these links are digitally signed by the transmitting PC,
providing authentication and integrity protection. The signature is DSA, done
using a private key owned by the Pathway PC transmitting the file. The file is

accompanied or preceded by the public key certificate needed to verify the
signature.

8.3.1.2 Not all receiving clients choose to validate the signatures, but for those that do
wish to do this, Pathway provides the CA public key stock needed to validate
the certificates.

8.4 Post Office Outlet Links

These are the links from the Post Office Ltd Central Services Domain to the Post Office
Outlets. Key Management of these links is automated by the Key Management System (KMS)

8.4.1 Protection

8.4.1.1. The protection ensures the authenticity of the parties to every communication
session over the Post Office Outlet Links.

8.4.1.2 Concealing data from eavesdroppers is not a primary objective of this protection
(unlike other forms of protection that may operate within a communication
session).

8.4.1.3 A specific Post Office Outlet becomes a member of the VPN community as a result
of the initial key distribution prior to auto-configuration phase. A commercial
VPN product utilising Red Pike and a custom encryption module is used to
support this.

8.4.1.4 Inbound ISDN calls (Post Office Outlet to Data Centre), is validated at the BT /
Energis Interchange prior to onward transmission to the Data Centres. CLI is
not validated outbound to the Post Office Outlet.

8.4.1.5 I Where symmetric encryption is used, it employs the Red Pike algorithm.

8.4.1.6 I Where asymmetric encryption is used, it employs either the DSA algorithm or, if
embedded in a bought-in technology, RSA.

8.4.1.7. A Virtual Private Network (VPN) is established to enable Post Office Outlets to
communicate with the campuses. The VPN members are the Post Office
Outlets and a set of central VPN servers.

8.4.1.8 I Communicating entities are authenticated as valid members of the VPN community
by mutual cryptographic challenge and response based on asymmetric keys.

8.4.1.9 I Asa result of successful mutual authentication, the parties establish a shared secret
symmetric key for the duration of the session.

8.4.1.10 Continued authentication is achieved by using the session key to encrypt all
transmitted data. During a session, all data, both Riposte and Network,
travelling across the link is encrypted as an added value consequence of using
VPN technology.

8.4.2 Key Management

8.4.2.1 At routine intervals, similar to those used for other key material, the VPN keys at
each Post Office Outlet are replaced by new values.

8.4.2.2 The KMS delivers replacement VPN keys to the Post Office Outlet under the
additional protection of a communication key established with the help of Diffie-
Hellman exchange. This protection is over and above the incidental encryption
afforded by the VPN.

8.5 Post Office LANs

These are the LANs that connect multiple-workstations in the larger Post Office Outlets.

8.5.1 Protection
Protection on these LANs is afforded by VPN

Key material that needs to be transferred between Post Office Outlet PCs is passed either
using the Post Office Manager’s Memory Card or via Riposte messages encrypted under a key
carried on the Memory Card.

8.5.1.1 Payment Authorisation and APS messages have the digital signature applied on
their respective source machine (hence they are integrity protected over the
LAN).

8.5.2 Key Management

8.5.2.1. I The Post Office Manager (or other individual authorised to access the Memory
Cards and the associated PIN) has to be present in order to successfully start
up a workstation at a Post Office Outlet, since the card is the only repository at
the Post Office Outlet for the filestore encryption key. To authenticate, the
Post Office Manager signs on presenting credentials. These are held, protected
by PIN (containing 64 bits of entropy) on a read-write Memory Card.

8.5.2.2 Keys are replaced at a Post Office Outlet, by a routine key refreshment procedure,
at intervals agreed with Post Office Ltd., based on advice from CESG.

This involves the KMS initiating the same protected Diffie-Hellman exchange
undertaken during roll-out, to establish key values used to protect the new key
material. When required, the POM is alerted to insert his Memory Card into the
Gateway PC to pick up the new key material, and to move from PC to PC in the
Post Office Outlet, propagating the values to the other PCs, where the key material
from the Riposte key distribution messages is also decrypted and installed as
appropriate.

8.5.2.3 If the Post Office Manager forgets the PIN or the Memory Card is lost or
damaged, recovery is achieved as follows:

e the Post Office Manager verbally authenticates to the Help Desk,

e the Help Desk authorises the KMS to send a special recovery key package to the
Post Office Outlet. The package contents is similar to the key material issued
during a routine key change, but the keys are the existing ones,

e the KMS sends recovery information to the Post Office Outlet using the Post
Office Outlet link as a (virtually) normal routine key refreshment procedure,

e the material is then loaded onto a new Memory Card for which a new PIN is
dynamically generated, and

e the Post Office Manager uses the new Memory Card and PIN to enable the
gateway and counter PCs.

8.5.3 Rollout to Post Offices

8.5.3.1 Every PC will cither be preloaded with the CA public keys it needs, to verify any
public key certificates and revocation lists transmitted to it, or they will have
been transmitted to the PC during the roll-out process and verified for their
integrity prior to use. Other public key material will have be transmitted during
the roll-out process.

8.5.3.2. With the exception of the CA keys, changes can be made if necessary through a
routine key refreshment procedure. The same procedure is used to verify that
the CA public keys held at the Post Office Outlet have not been tampered with.

8.5.3.3. During auto-configuration, the KMS forms an interactive connection with the Post
Office Outlet in order to establish an end-to-end communications key with the
Post Office Outlet Gateway PC.

The Diffie-Hellman exchange used has been extended to protect against man-in-the-
middle attacks.

8.5.3.4 I The communications key is used to encrypt confidential key material sent to the
Post Office Outlet.

8.5.3.5 A specific Post Office Outlet becomes a member of the VPN community during the
auto-configuration phase of its roll-out process, following the initial boot
server exchanges. A commercial VPN product is used to support this.

8.5.3.6 The presence of the global public key and certificate material in a key package sent
to the Post Office Outlet allows pre-KMS Post Office Outlet PCs to be
upgraded to the full solution design by transmitting the necessary key material
to them via this key package.

In a multi-workstation Post Office Outlet, relevant key material from the package
is passed on, by the Post Office Manager (POM), to all workstations. The mediums
used to transfer keys is the POM’s Memory Card and message replication.

8.5.3.7 All keys issued to Post Office Outlets are generated by the KMS (using
cryptographic quality random numbers provided by a hardware supported

with Post Office Ltd., based on advice from CESG.
8.6 Pathway Inter-campus Links

These are the links between the two Pathway campuses.

8.6.1 Protection

The physical characteristics of the high-speed connections between the campuses give a
significant level of inherent security. There is, currently, no hardware available that could
provide link level protection on these links.

8.6.1.1 Any key material passed between the Key Management Systems on the two
campuses is encrypted under Red Pike using a key shared between the two
KMSs.

8.6.2 Key Management

8.6.2.1 IThe KMS to KMS key is established automatically using an exchange protected by
the DSA private keys owned by the KMSs.

8.7 Horizon Help Desk and System Management Links

8.7.1 Overview

In addition to the Pathway inter-campus links (described in section 8.6), there are a number of
dedicated links into campuses that need to be protected. The network configuration is
illustrated in [TED].

8.7.1.1 All links from the Core Service sites to the campuses are encrypted.

8.7.2 Protection

System modifications (c.g. fault reporting) are done through the Horizon System Help Desk.
Caller authentication will, therefore, be strong and proofed against eavesdropping.

8.7.2.1 All data is encrypted for confidentiality and integrity using bought-in Government
approved point-to-point encryption devices employing the Rambutan algorithm
(see section 4.5.3).

8.7.2.2. System management functions, which could cause changes to security sensitive
data on campus machines forming a serious security threat, is protected.

8.7.2.3. The risks are considerably reduced by permitting only the activation of pre-
authorised fixing scripts and pre-defined Oracle Forms. The scripts used are
stored away from the management workstation.

A combination of integrity protection and the use of one-time passwords provides the basic
mechanisms.

8.8.1 Overview

There are dedicated links into the campuses sites from the Pathway Headquarters.
8.8.1.1 All links from the Pathway Headquarters site to the campuses is encrypted.

8.8.1.2 The System Support Centre (SSC) has controlled access. Remote access to FTMS
Gateways and Counters is managed and supported using SSH client on a

8.8.1.3. The On-line Analytical Processing (OLAP) and Oracle Financials connections only
provides client access to the respective applications that run on the
Management Information System(MIS).

8.8.1.4 The SSC platforms use a different LAN segment from that used by the OLAP and

8.9 Link to the NBE

8.9.1 Overview

This is the link between the Post Office Ltd. Central Services Domain and the Network
Banking Engine (NBE).

8.9.2 Protection

The WAN link between Horizon and the NBE is encrypted. This facility is implemented using
encryption available on the CISCO routers which employ hardware encryption utilising an
Integrated Service Adapter which provides IPSec / 3DES encryption.

All message or file exchanges with the NBE are authorised and their integrity validated
through the use of MACs (Message Authentication Codes). MACs are calculated using a bi-
directional MAC key. The mechanism for protecting keys across the interface requires the use
of a shared Zone Master Key (ZMK) between Horizon and the NBE.

8.9.3 Key Management

Key management uses specialised cryptographic hardware known as a Host Security Module
(HSM). The MAC keys (utilising 3DES) are generated in an HSM on the NB Agents. Each
message carries with it the MAC key encrypted under the ZMK.

Further details are in Section 11.

8.11 Key Generation

Cryptographic keys are generated in one of the following ways:

provided in whatever standard approved way is normally recommended for that
product.

8.11.1.2 Keys generated in bulk for use by Layer 7 crypto routines uses entropy sourced
from an entropy generation product using hardware generation. This product
performs its own randomness assurance procedures. It is being evaluated by
CESG for government approval. In the meantime, Pathway provides
independent software logic that will spot check for continuing quality of
output, independent of the product’s own checks.

9.0 Message Protection
9.1 Technology

Unless otherwise stated, all message protection is performed using DSA with a 768 bit
modulus. Each DSA signature requires a cryptographically strong random initialisation value,
known as a K-value.

Entropy for K-values is generated internally where they are needed (in the Post Office Outlet
PC, the KMS or in the Tivoli signing system).

9.2 Key Management

9.2.1 Public Key Technology
Standard simple public key technology is used, as outlined below.

Under public key technology, protected messages are digitally signed by a private key and
validated using the private key’s matching public key. Working public keys are distributed
either at roll-out of a new Post Office Ltd. Outlet or by a KMS in public key certificates (“PK
certificates”) signed by a private key from a Certification Authority (CA).

The “CA private key” has a corresponding public key called the “CA public key”.

9.2.2 Public Key Certificates
Pathway’s “PK certificates” are based upon the X.509 standard.

9.2.2.1 PK certificates contain the public key, the name of the possessor of the
corresponding private key, an expiry date and key and certificate identifying
information.

9.2.2.2 The CA private key is held securely on a PC in a secure cabinet, within a secure
area and not connected to any network.

9.2.2.3 All digital signatures are verified using public key certificates either transmitted
with the signed data to be validated or already available to the verifier. Public
key certificates are checked to ensure that they are not expired and that they
have not been revoked. Where relevant, the certificate owner is checked
against the claimed origin of the data that is signed.

9.3 Automated Payments

9.3.1.1 Transactions digitally signed at Post Office Outlets are signature verified at the
harvesting agent that takes the transaction from the correspondence servers and
transfers it to the APS host. The signature is not carried forward into the APS
Host database since this would more than double the size of the database.
Direct protection of the transactions resumes when files containing APS
transaction records are digitally signed prior to transmission over links to Post
Office Ltd. APS clients (see Section 8.5).

9.3.1.2

For new integrity-critical products, the same overall architecture still holds. It
entails signing in the Post Office Outlet, verifying at the harvester, and integrity
protecting complete files of transactions for validation at the client-end PC.

Post Office private APS signing keys are replaced at intervals agreed with the Post
Office Ltd, based on advice from CESG, using the routine key replacement
mechanism.

9.4 Software Distributed to Post Office Outlets

New software releases are distributed to Post Office Outlets over communications links from
the central campuses.

9.4.1 Tivoli
9.4.1.1 All software payload for installation by Tivoli mechanism is digitally signed, for
protection in transmission, using the Software Issue Private Key (SIPR) and
verified on receipt using the corresponding Public Key (SIPU). The signature
uses 768 bit DSA.
9.4.2 Riposte
9.4.2.1 All software used via the Riposte desktop is digitally pre-signed off-line using the
RSA algorithm and validated by Riposte every time the desktop is loaded. The
key size is 512 bits.
9.4.2.2. The private key used in the signature is held in a high security environment at the
Pathway central sites.
This protection regime uses standard Microsoft cryptographic interfaces.
9.4.2.3. The Riposte code (developed by Escher) allows digitally signed applications to be
produced either by Escher or by authorised signatories.
Pathway is an authorised signatory, hence Pathway’s public key is acceptable in the
Riposte verification logic.
9.4.3 Protection of Non-desktop Software Resident on Post Office PCs
9.4.3.1 This is provided indirectly by the absence of a means of introducing software by
any other means, other than over the communications link to Pathway, and by
preventing modification through local interfaces by disallowing those functions.
9.4.3.2 Software whose functionality is confidential can be nominated for protection while
on filestore by including it in a library marked to be encrypted.

10.0 Filestore Encryption in Post Office Outlets
10.1 Data Confidentiality

Nominated files on Post Office Outlet workstations and gateway machines are automatically
encrypted at disk access level to preserve data confidentiality in the event of the workstation
being stolen. The parts that are encrypted are:

e the Windows NT swap file,
e the Riposte journal and any related working files,

e selected files containing the cryptographic keys held by the workstation, unless they are
protected as part of the key management design,

¢ selected counter application code libraries, as required by the application providers, and
e selected counter application data files as required by the application providers.

The whole of the swap file is encrypted prior to the loading of any externally supplied key
material. The key used is internally generated by the TeamCrypto product using its own
entropy, and is different for each boot-up of the PC. TeamCrypto uses a key supplied by the
KMS to encrypt all other areas of the hard disk (listed above).

The algorithm used is Red Pike

10.2 Functionality

None of the NT workstations installed in Post Office Outlets have operable floppy disk drives
(since, if fitted, they are physically blanked off and disabled in the BIOS). The workstations
have been rolled out to the sites with the majority of the software, including the crypto
software, pre-configured in the factory.

The delivered configuration of a particular workstation type (e.g. gateway or non-gateway) is
the same to, whatever Post Office Outlet it is being delivered.

Protection is applied after delivery on site.

The Post Office Manager (or authorised representative) is the only person on site who has the
means of unlocking the key to the filestore encryption. He/she is not, however, required to be
IT literate since the procedures used is straightforward and well documented.

In general each workstation is used by a different counter clerk who uses other authentication
data to sign on to the workstation. Counter clerks cannot unlock the filestore without
assistance from the Post Office Manager. Typically, a workstation may be left running all day
but counter clerks sign on and off at more frequent intervals.

10.3 Security Considerations

Some basic security considerations of the solution are:

The KMS is the source of the keys for all files except the swap file, for which a
new key is dynamically established by TeamWare Crypto on each PC during
each boot-up.

The product used to encrypt filestore is TeamWare Crypto, using the Red Pike
algorithm, for which CESG approval is required.

The Post Office Counter Manager sign-on is used to unlock the filestore (on power
on) so that normal counter clerks can then sign-on to the workstation.

It is inevitable that, across the large number of Post Office Outlets involved, some Post Office
Managers will forget their password, lose or damage the token needed to authenticate and
unlock the filestore.

11.0 Network Banking - Additional Features

The Network Banking Service (NBS) initially supports several On-line counter transaction
types, each being initiated by the presentation of a bank card. apart from deposit transactions
customer verification is via the use of PINPads or a visual check of customer signature by the
Post Office clerk. Dedicated NB Agents within the POL Central Service Domain exchange
data with the Network Banking Engine (NBE) over an encrypted link. Network Banking
Release I utilises WebRiposte to the extent that it has an updated message server, but does
not use additional web-services.

The RAC model of transactions and data flows has been adopted to support communication
with the Clients via the Network Banking Engine (NBE) but the counter application is generic
and supported by POL Reference Data.

This section deals with the additional security enforcing features and components introduced
as a result of the NBS.

11.1 E2E Security Domains

within the Client Domain are separate domains in their own right but are shown collectively
for convenience.

The provision of the NBS introduces a change to the existing system paradigm (i.e. real-time
interactions as opposed to message exchange) but does not alter the basic security posture of
the Horizon system. The NBS is afforded the existing security protection of the Horizon
infrastructure whilst within the POL Central Services Domain. Primary changes are related to
the links between the Central Services and NBE domains.

11.1.1. Security Components
For the NBS, Pathway provides additional facilities that ensure amongst other things:

e the integrity of NB data between the POL Central Service Domain and the NBE;

e PINs are encrypted into a PIN Block at the point of entry into the PINPad and across the
POL Central Service Domain;

e the confidentiality of sensitive NB data between the Counter NB application in the Office
Platform Service Domain and the NBE is maintained. Sensitive data is identified as
discretionary data held on the magnetic card tracks 1 and 2, or card details entered by the
Counter Clerk;

© separate key management schemes are used for PINs and other sensitive (e.g. Track 2)
data;

© the encryption of communications networks, between the POL Central Service Domain
and the NBE;

e the authentication and integrity of all information exchanges with the NBE;

e that only authorised services and protocols operate between the POL Central Service
Domain and the NBE;

© the installation and configuration of dedicated firewalls at the interface between the NBE
and each Data Centre supported by log analysing software.

e ‘Translation’ of encrypted PIN values across the POL Central Service and NBE domain
interface

11.2 PINPads

The NBS provides for the introduction and operation of PIN Pads to support Customer
authentication in respect of on-line banking transactions. All NB transactions (with the
exception of deposit transactions) are authorised at the Post Office counter either by the
counter clerk verifying the Customer signature or the Financial Institution via an online
verification of the Customer entered PIN Number. PIN Pads are installed at every customer-
facing counter position.

A single key management domain is provided for PIN Pads. This is supported by a secure key
installation and management scheme that is compliant with the relevant parts of ISO 11568
and 8732. (see section 11.6)

The DUKPT scheme is used for PIN encryption - Key generation and management of (single
length) DES keys and PIN Blocks comply with the required standard (ANSI X9.24:1998).

the characteristics of the PINPad are such that successful penetration of the PIN Pad does not
permit the disclosure of any previously entered PIN value and that there is no feasible way to
determine any past key given knowledge of any data that has been transmitted to and from the
PIN Pad.

11.2.1.1 PIN Value

The PIN value is encrypted by the PIN Pad upon entry by the customer and held in the
transaction message within a standard compliant PIN Block format (ISO 9564 Format 0). The
PIN value is only held in encrypted form within the Horizon system other than when first
entered at the PIN Pad and when translated into the encrypted form suitable for the NBE. PIN
block translation does not expose the clear text PIN. The translation process translates the
PIN from encryption under the PINPad DUKPT schema to a key and schema known to the
NBE.

The PIN encryption key is managed in accordance with the requirements of ISO 11568 or
8732. The PIN encryption key is specific to this function and is not used for any other
cryptographic purpose within the Horizon system.

Remote key management of PIN Pads is being implemented in NBS Release 1 timescales.
Remote key management of the PIN Pads will be performed remotely through enhancements
to the existing KMA functionality. These enhanced capabilities will also be used to re-initialise
the DUKPT scheme with a new initial key in the event of a key compromise.

All PIN processing and associated key management will be undertaken in accordance with
ISO 9564 and with the LINK Information Security Standard.

11.3 Office Platform Service Domain

The confidentiality of any sensitive data within a NB transaction is achieved by separately
encrypting the data at the counter application. Sensitive data is defined as either magnetic card
track 1 or 2 discretionary data, card data entered by the counter clerk (issue number/ start
date/ expiry date).

Key management is via an estate-wide key utilising the Red Pike algorithm, which is created
and delivered via KMS.

From this point onward the data remains encrypted whilst it is within the Horizon system
whether in transit or in storage.

11.4 POL Central Services Domain

Network Banking messages passing over the Horizon infrastructure are digitally signed in
both directions. The use of digital signatures ensures the authenticity, integrity and non-
repudiation of all exchanges between the Counter and the interface to the NBE. This

protection is in addition to VPN encryption deployed at the Outlet LAN and the WAN
between the Outlet and the Data Centres.

Replay protection is provided by a combination of measures. The (banking) transaction ID is
MACed and checked using a variant of the PIN encryption key to protect against PIN replay
attack, the origin of correspondence server banking message are validated to ensure that they
originated at the counter and duplicate responses received at a counter are ignored.

11.5 Horizon - NBE Interface

The Horizon system implements a number of security measures with respect to the NBE
interface. All Horizon components that interface directly to the NBE are protected by a DMZ
(De-Militarised Zone) that uses a combination of firewalls and filtering routers to screen
protocols and services across the interface.

All message or file exchanges with the NBE are authorised and their integrity validated
through the use of MACs (Message Authentication Codes). MACs are calculated using a uni-
directional MAC key (i.e. a separate key is used for data exchange in each direction). Key
management and key change frequency for the MAC key follows the same principles as
dictated for the (NBE) PIN encryption key. Key management is undertaken accordance with
ISO 8732 and ISO 11568.

11.5.1. Host Security Module

The encrypted PIN value is only valid within the POL Central Services Domain. Whenever a
domain boundary is crossed the encrypted PIN value is translated into the encrypted value of
the second domain. Conversion of the PIN encrypted value between the Central Services
operational domain and the NBE takes place within a separate host security module (HSM)
that ensures that the PIN value never appears in plain text.

HSMs are held in secure locations within the Data Centres. Corresponding physical security is
afforded the encryption units located at the NBE site.

The operation of the translation of the encrypted PIN value conforms to the LINK standard
(LINK Switch Service Interchange Standard LISS Security Standard). Key management for
the HSM is also conformant to the LINK standard.

Key management for the HSM storage master keys is via a standalone Card Loading
Workstation which is located in a secure Fujitsu Services facility.

Storage master keys and key management for HSMs is distinct from any other cryptographic
keys used for the exchanges between Horizon and the NBE.

11.6 PIN Encryption Key Generation & PINPad Key Loading

To support PINPad initialisation and rollout, secure key management and key handling
procedures and processes are established with the Pin Pad vendor.

PINPad key generation and loading is a multi-part process involving both Pathway and the
Vendor. Within this process discrete separation of the duties of each party is enforced. In
particular, Pathway is responsible for the generation of the keys from which the PIN
encryption key is either derived or directly protected.

A particular facet of the PINPad loading process applied by the Vendor is the use of MIDU
units. A MIDU is a tamper resistant unit that is used for both key generation and other
cryptographic functions. The use and algorithms applied by the MIDU’s are compliant with
ISO 9564 and 11568.

An overview of the sequence of key generation and loading (and the involved parties) is
shown in Figure 11.2 below:

11.6.1 GKLK Generation

The Global Key is generated in a secure Pathway facility using a SCT hardware device. The
key is generated in multiple parts and handled, transcribed and stored (separately) by at least
two individuals to ensure that no one individual has access to all the parts — and thus the
whole key.

11.6.2 Pin Pad Load Package Generation

Generation of the PINPad Load package is performed in a secure facility at the Vendor’s site
conducted under the supervision of authorised personnel. The required inputs for the
processes are the Global Key and the KAREA index.

The PINPad software and the key parts are input into a stand-alone system and encrypted
values of the Pin Pad program and Global Key parts produced. The production of the

encrypted components is a serial process whereby each part is submitted, passed to a secure
MIDU-A unit for encryption and then copied to a disk before the next part can be introduced.
The production of the encrypted parts is a time-bounded process that is controlled by the load
production software.

Key parts are encrypted under a randomly generated triple DES key. The PINPad program is
encrypted under single DES variant of this key and a random number key is encrypted under
the KAREA key. The KAREA key is generated from the KAREA index that is unique to
Horizon. (Note: the KAREA key is not available outside of the MIDU-A).

11.6.3 Order File Creation

An Order File containing PINPad Serial numbers and other non-sensitive attributes is created
by the Vendor and sent to Pathway.

11.6.4 DUKPT Initial Key Generation

The generation of DUKPT Initial Keys is performed within a secure facility at Pathway on a
dedicated stand-alone system running a key generation application.

The global derivation key (BDK) is generated in a using a hardware device (SCT). The key is
generated in 2 parts with a KCV (for the whole key). Each Key part and the KCV are
generated, handled, transcribed and stored separately by two individuals to ensure that no one
individual has access to all the parts — and thus the whole key.

The key generation application uses a two-step process to calculate the unique encrypted
initial key (IK) for each PINPad. The separate GKLK and BDK parts are loaded into the HSM
where they are encrypted under a randomly generated Triple DES key. The resultant
encrypted key values are then stored on the Key Generation PC.

The encrypted BDK and GKLK are then loaded in to the HSM and the records from the
Order file are input into the HSM. For each Pin Pad a key encryption key (BKLK) and initial
key (IK) is calculated and the encrypted IK is derived. A file record is then output containing
the Pin Pad Serial number and the PINPad IK encrypted under the BKLK. The file records are
written to CD for subsequent transport to the Vendor.

In operational terms the above process is performed for two derivation keys (BDK1 and
BDK2) and the output files are written to separate CDs. The file of IK keys encrypted under
BDKI are used to prime the rolled-out PINPads and the file of IK keys encrypted under
BDK2 is retained for those scenarios (e.g. repair) where it would be necessary to change the
PINPad keys. The file of encrypted [Ks (from BDK1) sent to the Vendor.

(Note: BDK keys never leave the Pathway secure facility.

11.6.5 Key Loading

PINPads are primed in three stages in a secure facility at the Pin Pad production centre:

e a MIDU is used to load the Boot processor of the ‘bare’ PINPad with a Boot Guard Key.
e a Tamper Seal is applied to the Pin Pad.

e a MIDU loader unit is used to load the loader code, PINPad Serial number and an
encrypted loader key into the PINPad. The PINPad Serial number and the encrypted
Loader key are placed in a special security zone of the PINPad implemented by a
combination of both hardware/software design and operation that is only available to the
Security Loader in a specific mode.

The loading of PINPad keys is performed in a secure Key Loading Area. The load process
requires inputs of the KAREA index, the encrypted Pin Pad program code and GKLK parts,
the encrypted IK File and the Pin Pad Serial number.

After entry of the KAREA index and Pin Pad Serial number at the MIDU-A, the encrypted
KAREA key is calculated in the MIDU-A and then loaded into the PINPad’s security area. A
subsequent process then loads the encrypted programs, random number key, PINPad IK and
GKLK parts into the PINPad.

After loading the input components the PINPad Security Loader decrypts and stores the
program code; overwrites and deletes the random key encrypted under the KAREA; decrypts
the GKLK parts and derives the BKLK key — using a DES process and overwrites and deletes
the encrypted GKLK parts.

11.6.6 Pin Pad Verification

Pathway verifies and validates the initial PINPads produced by the vendor using a PINPad
Proving System. This is a dedicated stand-alone system within a Pathway secure facility that
validates by functional testing the key usage and functions of the PINPad. This includes PIN
processing (and the MAC) by the HSM. If the test is successfully completed the Vendor ships
the loaded PINPads.

For cach shipment of Pin Pads received, Pathway will sample every 500" unit and verify the
Pin Pad set-up using the Pin Pad proving system.

11.7 Audit and Alarms

11.7.1 Audit

Network Banking audit requirements are detailed in the Audit Trail Functional Specification
(CR/FSP/006).

The statutory requirement for certification in accordance with the relevant sections of PACE
(s69 and s70) no longer exists but Pathway ensures as far as possible that relevant information
produced by the system at Post Office Ltd's request is admissible in support of prosecutions.
The confidentiality and integrity of sensitive data (e.g. PIN value, Card discretionary data) is
maintained within the audit archive by retaining the encrypted value of the data which can be
used in support of investigations and/or evidence for the resolution of disputes and
prosecutions.

requirements of RIPA (2000):

© network encryption keys;

e the cryptographic session key used to encrypt the sensitive customer card details within
the Horizon environment.

PIN encryption keys or any other key that directly or indirectly reveals plain text PINs are
never revealed — not even in support of investigations or evidence.

11.7.2. Alarms

In the event of a suspected key compromise, of any NBS related key (HSM master keys,
ZMKs, PIN Pad initialisation keys etc.), key change mechanisms will be called into force.

Where a key is suspected of compromise, it will be changed such that the suspect key gives no
information about the replacement key. In addition, any key directly or indirectly protected by
the suspect key will also be treated as suspect.

The timing of any key change will take into account the nature of the security breach giving
rise to the key change, its impact on system availability, and the presence of any compensating
controls.

Where a suspected compromise affects the Horizon environment an enhanced capability of
the existing KMA and manual procedures will be used to change keys within the Horizon
system.

Where a suspected compromise affects the NBE PIN Translation Key, then key changes_ will
be applied at the NBE. A procedure will be agreed between Post Office Ltd. and Fujitsu
Services to co-ordinate the changes at the Horizon - NBE interface.

Post Office Ltd. will allow access to Pathway representatives to apply key changes to the
encryption units at the NBE site.

13.0 Administration of Security

Administration of security is largely concerned with management and operational controls but
there are also supporting technical controls that are implemented.

System management facilities preserve the integrity of the system and contribute towards
achieving high system availability. The software distribution facilities, in particular, incorporate
mechanisms for integrity protection of all files/modules distributed to end systems.

User management is distributed because the bulk of the user population is managed as small
groups local to each Post Office Outlet.

13.1 Management Roles and Responsibilities

Pathway’s Security Policy [SECPOL] contains a definition of responsibilities for security
within Pathway.

The Pathway Access Control Policy [ACCPOL] contains a detailed definition of roles and
responsibilities for all personnel who have any kind of access to the services provided by
Pathway.

The following subsections provide a simplistic overview of the operational, system
management and support roles.

13.1.1. Operational Roles

The operational roles comprise the “users” of the system in its operational state, as follows:

e Post Office Manager (Post Office Ltd.), and

e Post Office Counter Clerks (Post Office Ltd.).

A distinction is made between the Post Office Manager and Post Office Counter Clerks.

13.1.2 Systems Management Roles

The system management roles ensure the system is running for the “users” in the operational
roles. In simple terms, these are the roles for which Fujitsu Core Services have main
responsibility, as follows:

e System Manager (Fujitsu Core Services),

e System Operator (Fujitsu Core Services),

e Database Administrator (Fujitsu Core Services/Oracle),
e Network Manager (Fujitsu Core Services), and

e Encryption Key Custodians (Fujitsu Core Services).

Encryption key custodians have responsibility for the use and safekeeping of encryption keys.
These keys are used to enable the Rambutan based encryption devices at each site. For
simplicity, Fujitsu Core Services manage all keys used in the central Data Centre site.

These features are used to provide efficient and reliable installation of new software releases.

13.3.2. Event Management

Event Management is the ability to take events from one or more sources, use defined rules to
establish whether local actions need to be taken and/or whether notification is to be forwarded
to central event servers. Sources of such events include applications and the operating
systems.

13.3.2.1 Wherever possible, existing technology for handling events are used, with the
events mapped into a normalised form for handling by the central event
manager.

13.3.2.2. The event logs used by Windows NT are integrated with the system management
components.

13.3.2.3. Network components, which emit events as Simple Network Management
Protocol (SNMP) traps, are integrated with the system management
components.

13.3.3. Network Management

Network management runs from a central service providing facilities for:

e reporting and diagnosing network events,

© consolidating and interrogating statistics, and

© controlling the configuration and parameter settings on network devices.
The global system is divided into three levels for network management purposes:

1. The backbone network - comprising the LAN hubs and LAN attachments at the Pathway
central sites, the links between the Pathway sites, links to Post Office Ltd., with associated
routers.

2. The branch Fujitsu Core Services network - terminated at the central routers and at the
gateway PC at each outlet

3. The office LAN at each outlet - comprising the PC LAN attachments and local Ethernet
hub (present where three or more PCs are installed).

Management of the underlying ISDN switched circuit network are provided by Energis. The
implementation of Network Management includes interfacing to the Network service supplier
to obtain a structured data feed regarding the state of the whole network including ISDN

The network management facilities are based primarily upon the use of SNMP mechanisms,
with additional facilities provided across the ISDN network at platform level via the Microsoft
NT event system and associated middleware.

13.3.4 Resource Monitoring

13.3.4.1 I The resource monitoring facilities are used to establish criteria for monitoring an
individual resource.

13.3.4.2 When resource monitoring criteria are met, they will trigger pre-defined local
action and/or generate an event.
Typically, notification would be provided when available free disk space has
reached an appropriate threshold.

13.3.5 Inventory Management

13.3.5.1 I Bespoke Inventory applications are used to manage the software and hardware
inventory.

13.3.5.2. A central repository holds persistent records identifying the software products
installed on each managed node.

13.3.5.3_ The data recorded is obtained by evaluating the software signature for each
software product on the nodes.

13.3.5.4 The central repository holds persistent records identifying the hardware associated
with individual managed nodes and its attached peripherals.

13.3.5.5 I Where appropriate, asset numbers are held for the individual components.

13.4 User Management

The user management facilities provided by Riposte, and its associated applications, are used
to manage all Post Office Outlet users within the OPS Domain. For all other users, facilities
provided by the standard COTS products will be used for administration tasks.

13.4.1. Administration of User Accounts

The majority of users are Post Office staff within the Office Platform Service Domain.

Each Post Office Manager manages the small group of Post Office Counter Clerks within their
Post Office Outlet as a local community. The interface used provided by Riposte maps to the
underlying Windows NT functions.

Within the central sites, Pathway’s system administrators are responsible for managing user
accounts on the Sequent (Dynix), Windows NT platforms and routers using the standard
facilities.

13.4.2. Administration of Access Controls

Access controls are configured in accordance with [ACCPOL] using the facilities outlined in
section 6.0.
