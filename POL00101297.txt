For information ~ the typos will be sorted but this is what Angela is going to send to the Working Group now

Dear All,

As a courtesy I wanted to write to you all to inform you that Post Office have been contacted by BBC Look North about
the Scheme. It is clear that they have been shown a copy of Second Sight’s Part Two Report and also my letter. Post
Office have been asked for an interview or a statement however given the confidential nature of both the documents and
the Working Group’s proceedings we intend to respond along the following lines:

“tt is unfortunate that this Report, prepared for the mediation scheme, has been leaked when it was marked confidential.
This cannot be in the interest of those applicants who have applied to the Scheme and for that reason we will not be
commenting publicly on what is a leaked document”

Thave to say that I am, as I am sure you all are too, very disappointed that the confidentiality of the Scheme has not been
respected. This kind of media running commentary cannot be in the Applicants’ best interests as it will only distract from
the immense amount of hard work being put in to resolve the applicants’ concerns.

Best regards,

Angela
