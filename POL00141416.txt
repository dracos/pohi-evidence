        Morning Jarnail

        I have made a start putting together any offices that we know have had horizon mentioned. This list is made up from various
        sources and there is still a lot of work to be done with some offices to be added, and possible some to be removed if not showing in
        our casework reports (Alison Bolsover supplied me with a list and some of those may not be related to us directly) (some of the
        details have been completed by others and I will work through these and check/amend the detail accordingly)



                                                                                                                                                                                                                     POL-0142801
                                                                                                                                    POL00141416
                                                                                                                                 POL00141416
 I have sent an email out to `old' security personnel to see if they can remember any specific offices where horizon was questioned
 and it may take a week or so for response as there are quite a few on leave at present.

 I am working through the list and putting in as much detail as I can find out from old reports/case closure forms etc. I am then
 planning on looking at the past year or two for offices not on this list to ensure none of the recent cases are missed.

 This is a time consuming project reading through various reports and documents. In our previous phone call you mentioned where
 sometimes there would be bargaining and some cases would be charged with false accounting rather than theft and false
 accounting on the proviso that the horizon system is not brought into question. Do you have any names of offices where this will
 have been the case please, or where this would be documented (case closure/legal memos etc)

 I have attached the spreadsheet so far, could you please confirm to me if this is what you are wanting. Columns D, E and F are
 designed to be a first glance check list, with further details about the case in columns G to M. If there is anything you think I should
 include to assist you in future could you please let me know.

 Do you have any time scales in which you would like this returning by and who you would like keeping up to date with the progress.

 Once this is completed my thoughts are that, any time horizon integrity is mentioned at any part of the interview/prosecution
 process the spreadsheet is automatically updated with details completed as the case progresses.
