Name            Area             Issues/Observations/Comments       y        •'.:

Andy Winn       FSC              Mentioned recovery issue where £10 E TOP
                                 UP failed at counter, tried again and it
                                 went through. However, when the
                                 failure/recovery screen was acknowledged
                                 branch ended with 2 x E TOP UPS for £10
                                 each yet SPMR had only completed 1 x E TOP
                                 UP at £10.

Dave            Security         Relayed network concerns (Craig Tuthill)
Posnett                          about withdrawing from
                                 investigations/prosecutions, thus leaving
                                 SPMR with debt (e.g. SPSO assistant
                                 theft).

Gayle           Network          Confirmed the above and cited 2 branches
Peacock                             • Metro Centre - contract not
                                      terminated as assistant prosecuted,
                                      but SPMR banking on prosecution and
                                      maybe problem contractually.
                                    • Fordham - case withdrawn but wasn't
                                      communicated.
Rodric          Legal            Re-iterated that it was POLs choice
Williams                         whether we prosecute or not and that the
                                 commerciality aspects affecting branches
                                 should not come into the equation. Also
                                 stressed that we should consider the debt
                                 and how we can assist on a case by case
                                                                             POL00083930
                                                                          POL00083930




                                   basis.

Gayle             Network          Stated there appears to be comms issues ...
Peacock                            need a line of communication.

Rodric Williams   Legal            Comms needs to be factored into decisions
                                   once prosecution is withdrawn.

Rob King          Security         Request to speak with Gayle offline re

                                   with contracts managers.

John Scott        Security         Explained rationale/requirement to
                                   password protect documents relating to
                                   Horizon issues.

Andy Winn         FSC              Outlined branch in Burnham, where
                                   £1,600.00 debt was repaid, but as branch

                                   saying we'll be returning money subject to
                                   outcome of security review.

Humphries                          re ways of communicating to MPs cases,
