remaining 1% shareholding will be gifted to Royal
Mail's eligible UK employees - taking the total stake
in the business owned by employees to 12%.

The sale has raised £591.1 million. Proceeds raised
from sales of all the government's shares total £3.3
billion.

Business Secretary, Sajid Javid, said:

“ This is a truly historic day for Royal Mail with
the workers gaining a share of this history.

We have delivered on our promise to sell the
government's entire remaining stake which
means that for the very first time the company
is now wholly owned by its employees and
private investors. This is the right step for the
Royal Mail, its customers and the taxpayer.

Proceeds will also go to help pay off the
national debt — a crucial part of our long term
plan to provide economic security for working
people.”

Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne said:

“ This is a milestone moment in the long and
proud history of the Royal Mail, when we
secure its long term future. By fully leaving
state ownership we have a win all round - for
customers, the workforce and the taxpayer.
And every penny will be used to pay down
our national debt as we continue to bring our
public finances under control.

Once again, we are also going to recognise
the hard work of the staff who have done a
great job in turning the company around, and
give them a 1% stake to share between
them.”

There is no policy need for government to hold
shares in Royal Mail, as the universal postal service
remains well protected by law and by Ofcom

(http:/Awww.ofcom.org.uk/).

Post Office Ltd, which operates the network of
branches throughout the UK, remains wholly-owned
