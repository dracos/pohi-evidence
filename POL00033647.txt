remainder of Q1 & 2, with an intention to review in Q3.

« The purpose of today’s meeting, is to cascade the
details of these changes , so that you will be prepared for
onward communication to your own teams during the
remainder of Jan 2012.

Revisit all of the original stakeholders to seek feedback

All of the original stakeholders were approached for feedback on the piloted training package, and were asked to submit
feedback using the Lose, Change & Keep approach that had been used successfully in the original project.

Review the current packages and training materials, considering the feedback:

Engagement was undertaken with all of the Field Team Leader owners of the training materials and classroom sessions, to go
through the stakeholder feedback and deliver any changes or enhancements made as appropriate.

Cascade the results of the feedback and any changes made to the training materials or processes to the Field Team

There will be a number of training events early in Q4 to cascade the results of the review and give detail of any/all changes to
formats, packages and materials used for training in Classroom and on-site including the Post Transfer Contact Process. These
will be led by the Field Team Leaders with their teams, following their own event on 12TH January 2012.

Final communication to stakeholders January 2012:

All changes will be communicated to the stakeholders during January/February 2012.

Blue Cashcheques transaction especially is now very uncommon and could be
covered on site if necessary this would give more time in class to introduce
Paystation and stress to the delegates’ how important Paystation is to the future of
the business rather than spend time on paper based transactions that we as a
business are moving away from.

Agree we can take out the session as we cover HMRC cheques in the same session
which covers security etc, will look at Paystation session once the timetable has
been reviewed. There is also a session on these in the rural transaction guide that
can be used onsite.

Day 2 ~ add Postage (16) and Cheqs, Deb/Cred (51) card to second day
Follow on with Post office card account 54 pt 1 and Per/ online Banking 51 pt 3
We will look at this when we review the timetable

» Sipti,51pt3 & 54pt1 - Merge these three sessions and allocate the time to cover
properly. They all make use of same technology on HOL and can be run well
together. As personal banking cannot be processed on HOL just to give overview
only on these.

Timetable needs adjusting. Too much information on Day 1. Postage, etc.
should be on Day 2 with Day 1 covering the admin sessions, Compliance,
Securtity, etc.

We will look at this when we review the timetable

*Session 51pti cheque/debit card would be good to have a slide to say what
we can and can’t accept cheques for.

*No, and the reason for this is we could be constantly changing the slide if
the way we settle a transaction changes, bill payments normally have the
method of payment on them, there was a communication sent out to
branches listing products we can no longer accept cheques for, and we can
use debit cards for most transactions and if their not sure we all ways ask
the customer to try anyway.

*Day 1 is overloaded. Suggest moving Cheque acceptance to day 2 (see
timetable).

«We will look at this when we review the timetable

-Combine the Cashcheques and DWP sessions which are very similar There
is no need also for 2 separate questionnaires, these could also be combined.

1. Ready to Serve - Change to a form that is completed once a
week (Monday). (Julia’s Team)

2. Ready to Serve Document to be completed weekly rather than
daily. By the end of week 1 the Postmaster just goes down the
list and puts a tick against whatever was ticked the previous
day without reading the question and consequently the form
loses it value. (Rita’s Team)

3. Ready to Serve document is useful for new agents to prepare
themselves. Maybe not to be used on a daily basis when they
are more used to the job, but new agent feedback has said as
an initial aid it was very useful. (Rita’s Team)

4. Ready to Serve - This requires the PM to do a check every day
which is too much and not really required. As a result, they
tend to do it for about a week or two and then forget it. It would

be better if it were a ‘once a week’ task and maybe the (3)

All of this was discussed, and although the general
feedback was to change the Ready to Serve document
from being completed Daily to Weekly, due to Retail
Standards it was decided that some areas could be
checked weekly others still need to be completed every
day.

Although most new Postmasters may stop completing
this document after a few weeks, the importance of the
Ready to Serve document should be explained as if it’s
not followed, themselves and customers of theirs
could be at risk.

As a result of feedback from the whole team a number of change requests
were made.

The sessions which are my responsibility are the ones relating to the Sales
conversations and positioning of the product. The Sales Team have input
into these sessions also as they are responsible for the conversations and
compliance for the individual products.

The following slides are broken down into different sections for ease of
review.

Sales Session - Too long a session , delegates don't like it and don’t participate, (General comment on all
sessions. Not specific to an actual session).

‘This relates to all conversational ssions and is dependant on number of participants and
their willingness to participate. Conversations under review by the Sales Team

Session 6 Credit Card - We can only refer to the leafiet

We are obliged to keep this on the timetable if the Sales Team request it. Session is still valid even
though we cannot process in branch.

12 pt2 Perfect Branch - See no benefit to this exercise

42 pt2 The Perfect Branch - The content of the slides is poor and basically is already covered in the
sessions Business Awareness, Customer Service and The Secret.

Slides are set by the Sales Team and are currently under review. The exercise is designed as an
end to the course (for most) which enforces knowledge of conversations. It is dependant on the
number of delegates/willingness to participate. No change required to slides, they are just summary
slides building up to the exercise. Could be moved to before Stock Balancing session as delegates
just want to go home after that.

insurance session is far too long. Could be split and use session on Car Tax to introduce
car & bike. Home insurance linked with redirection etc

All of the sales & service conversations and positioning are currently under review and will be
available for inclusion in the classroom offer from the end of Q4

Handout — The secret assessing conversations - More beneficial is to replace this with the ‘Science
behind the conversations’ ( to go with the Minimum standard conversations handouts.)

No change required. The ‘assessing conversations’ handout is to reinforce the slide. The ‘science
behind the conversations’ is a 19 page document and is not designed to be given out, more as a
reference point although it can be printed as required. This document may change under the current
Sales Team review

The Secret - 45 Slides!!! This whole session does not work & is unnecessary if the sales
aspect of our transactions are delivered well.

Slides are designed by the Sales Team and are currently under review. The session is designed
as a pre-cursor to doing the individual sales sessions showing the science behind sales. Is the
issue more to do with the wording on the slides/notes than the session itself?

Red and green is designed to be like traffic lights suggesting a route to follow. The handouts/slides
could be changed se that the question box has a red or green outline but the in-fill is white with black

64 Savings - Very wordy slides, could do with a lot of simplification & most of the detail in the notes.

64 PO Savings ~ Over complex with delegates being bombarded with features on all savings. Let's
use the HOL kit in practical support of products and services ie concentraie on instant Saver which
can be processed on HOL, and also premium bonds which again can be processed on HOL. Quick
overview showing web site on our other products.

The Sales team have ownership of the content of this session. Inputting on HOL is an option but will add

time to the course. itis a ‘scan barcode’ transaction so not hard to do. Time is better spent doing other
practical's. The Savings session now has an extra slide showing direct sales products (as of 01/12)

12 Customer service - Better if merged with session 1 Intro, too late in the course by day 2

No change required. The ‘intro’ session on day 1 is an introduction to the course itself. Session
12 Customer Service is a pre-cursor to Session 12 pt 2 and sets the scene for that session.

Insurances, link them to sessions -- example, home insurance linked with redirection rather than 3
hours on insurances.

Concentrate on practical ‘Customer Referrals’ exercise using Car Insurance / Home
insurance. Can't remember if we can completely process Over 50 application on HOL in
classroom. If we can have an exercise on taking application and in depth selling scenario
using Over 50 Prospectus.

Insurances - Very brief overview on Insurances and where to access info ie website, or Help.

Inputting on HOL is an option but will add time to the course. It is a ‘scan barcode’ /follow the
prompts transaction so not hard to do. Time is better spent doing other practical’s. No harm in
doing a customer referral transaction but can be at discretion of instructor rather than a scripted
transaction

Could be linked into other sessions but would mean a lot of work and agreement as to where
they would sit best.

Session is under review by Sales Team so best to wait until outcome of that.

Keep

Minimum Standards Conversations handout very good starting point for delegates.

12 pt2 The Perfect Branch - no issues

61 insurances - no issues

The above points seem to contradict other feedback. This seems to suggest that the sessions are
only as good as the delegates/instructor make it. Some people embrace the sales sessions whilst
others simply read from the notes. is it a confidence issue in the delivery of the slides that has this
effect? Do we need to give extra support to those delivering courses or can the slides be better?
There could be more notes but then you are in danger of them sounding too scripted

Issues

My feeling is there should be a course written completely from scratch that is aimed specifically at someone
who will have to run a branch by themselves after a couple of weeks or so. As a for instance, we could
cover Rem’s more fully.

The notes are very full now almost scripted and even though I tried to follow them I found I was talking
ahead of the slides. I do find it hard to train with the notes in front of me meaning that i have probably
missed something that was important. When I was running courses back to back I developed my own style
and more importantly, made changes. So the next course always ran smoother than the previous one,
unfortunately this doesn’t seem possible now, which I fully understand

I didn’t really understand slide 14 in session 9, and there are no notes. The notes for slide 6 say, ‘you may
have seen this before’, when did the delegates see this slide before? If we are going to simply put another
presentation designed for a different type of audience into the course, can we at least make some changes
to reflect what we are about? In fact i wasn't comfortabie delivering this session as although it clearly is
important, I didn’t feel qualified to deliver it. it is clearly designed to be delivered by an experienced sales
manager.

General comment on running a course. It does suggest that if you do classroom training on a regular basis,
you are able to understand the course content better and develop a fluidity in your delivery. This can only
be obtained by doing courses regularly and so is dependant on geographical location and delegates
availability. Slide 14 on Session 9 The Secret is a little confusing. It seems to compare branches that have
been on a sales workshop for Mails against those that haven't although it is not too clear what it all means.
Do we need someone from the Sales Team expiaining/running this session at one of our Patch meetings?
Hopefully this is under review and it will become more clear. Notes on slide 6 relate to the instructor seeing
the slide before, not the delegate.

Minimum Standard Conversation would have been useful if they had it sent to them with the distance
learning pack so they would be able to look at it in advance so as to see what they would be doing
when we cover the perfect branch

No change required. Previous feedback suggested too much was in the DLP so it was reduced
dramatically as a result. Minimum standards document is introduced eartier in the week so they
are aware of the conversations and have practiced them a number of times by then anyway.

Focus CTC on core products and leave sales until a later date

No change. Need to embed some sort of sales cas from the outset. Itis the best environment
to do this in the classroom as there are no other distractions

Spmr’s feel the sessions are too rushed. Too much info in a short period of time (Three
people commented on this)

Sessions are only as fast as the slowest delegate. Maybe the ones saying they feel rushed are the
slower delegates? There is a lot to do on each day so some sessions may feel rushed but instructor
has to take other variables into account. le. Bus/train times, travelling and even room availability times.

Not long enough in classroom.

We had this when it was 10 days long. There will always be somebody wanting longer.

Not enough practical sessions. More opportunity to put into practice what has been learned. (three
people commented this way)

Agree although it is at the instructors discretion to do random practicals as time allows. Most delegates
are in by 08:50 so could do some transactions then using spares in the branch. More practicat's have

been built into the new course.

Day 1 of the counter training course is too busy. To do the Introduction/Horizon/Stock
unit/Postage/All the mails/ Cheques/Postal orders on the first day is too much for them to take in
1st -2nd-recorded delivery-special delivery is too important. The Mails session needs to be changed
to a first session later in the week. (Ail NFSA’s who deliver CTC said this)

Agree on this but proposed new timetable has moved Cheques/Debit cards to day 2 and allowed
exira time for RM transactions.

The Insurance and Moneygram sessions are only available to delegates who do Passports/MVL.

Moneygram can be done onsite really quickly and maybe the insurance sessions could be
spread onto each relevant cross-selling opportunity's transaction. le: Home Insurance could be.
introduced during Mail Redirection. Car/bike/van could be done whilst doing MVL's. This would
mean a lot of work though as each session would have to be changed to include the sales
conversations which are under review.

There should be 15 mins each day for delegates to complete their PSA.

I would suggest, and this is done as best practice in my team, that the PSA is completed
at the end of every session rather than at the end of the day. It is still fresh in their mind
at that point.

Summary

You are probably all thinking that I haven't done much here and you are
correct to a certain extent

The sessions for which I have responsibility are mainly completed by the
Sales Team so until I know the outcome of their review I can’t do much
either. New conversations will be coming out shortly so that will affect us all
in the New Year

The feedback I have had has highlighted areas for improvement. Hopefully
some, if not all of these, will be addressed by the Sales Team's review.

Every FTM should be able to deliver
a classroom course.

it is the role of the FTL to manage the activity
and performance of each individual to ensure
they can deliver the course confidently.

if ‘Specialists’ were to be introduced it would
restrict us to the number of courses run and
the location.

Currently if a FTM has been

scheduled to deliver a course that

has not done one for a while it often

reverts back to the FTM that regularly
delivers them as they are not

confident enough.

This results is reorganising work

plus also scheduling FTM to shadow
another FTM thus effecting the

resource availble for other activity

Classroom Continued

Approximately 4-5 mins

This would increase days allocated

to classroom and would reduce

resource available for audit and

training activity

This cannot be done to early as the materials
would be out of date before the course started
hence the prep day.

A possible solution would be to check the
materials during the Health and Safety checks
carried out at the CTO’s every 3 month.

This give consistency for the delegates and
allows the FTM’s to gage the understanding of
each delegate across the 6-8days.
