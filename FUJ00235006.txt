Data backups are an essential component of HNG-X and are potentially critical in ensuring data
availability in the event of data corruption or system failure.

Data corruption may occur as a result of user error, application error, middleware error,
hardware failure or firmware bugs. Data corruption means that the data is no long readable, or
is no longer the data that was written.

A number of third parties connect to the Data Centres using diverse connectivity mechanisms

Third parties will connect to a Transit LAN. The Transit LAN is considered to be the boundary
between the HNG-X network and any externally administered organisation that HNG-X connects
to. The transit LAN exists both for security and to provide an unambiguous demarcation between
HNG-X and that organisation.

This clearly defined demarcation is necessary to assist fault and service resolution, to facilitate

11.4.5 Segregation in Networks

There are a number of defined security domains with the HNG-X security model and
therefore data traffic will always be either intra-domain traffic or inter-domain traffic.

The only permitted connections to the POA network must be:
e — Intra-domain traffic - Data traffic moving between systems in the same domain.
e — Inter-domain traffic — Data traffic moving between systems in different domains.

There is a third class of traffic consisting of data moving into and out of the HNG-X infrastructure.

Intra-domain traffic may be unrestricted because the systems share a LAN segm:

The network segmentation is achieved using a combination of physical and virtual controls.
Dependent on the Security Domain and any specific contractual agreements with third parties,
the network segmentation is enforced using VLANs, Stateful Inspection Firewalls, Access Control
Lists and physical separation.

Each different network media type is authenticated using a dedicated RADIUS server instance
for network device access, with different Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol
credentials per Branch Router.

Each human support user accessing a network device is authenticated using the Identity and
Access Management Service.

All access in and out of the HNG-X environment must be restricted to the required traffic from/to
the authorised sources/destinations for business and system traffic using routers and firewalls.

The HNG-X network is divided into 11 Security Domains. The term Security Domain is defined to
mean a collection of platforms and network components grouped together based on type,
perceived vulnerability and risk rating. Even so, it may be necessary to restrict traffic between
platforms in a common Security Domain (intra-domain traffic) through the imple!

11.6 Application and Information Access Control

11.6.1 Information Access Restriction

A key principle with the HNG-X Architecture — Security Architecture (Ref:- ARC/SEC/ARC/0003)
is that of Least Privilege

Access must be provided using the principle of “that which is not explicitly granted is denied” or a
“default deny”, by only granting the permissions necessary to carry out the action’
performed. These permissions include application, platform, network and manag
policy and process), or any combination necessary to perform the action

This approach assumes that, subject to risk assessment and given the
system or other software, any entity such as a user, an application, a de’
application code has no permissions to perform any action before: is
assumes that the default configuration of all systems is to deny acc

15.3.1 Information System Audit Controls

Fujitsu Services are required to provide facilities to store audit data and subsequently present it
for analysis as described in the Horizon (On-Line) Architecture — Support Services (Ref:-
ARC/SVS/ARC/0001).

This is in support of the audit requirements laid down for HNG-X Technical Secutity Architecture
(Ref:- ARC/SEC/ARC/0003).

15.3.2 ‘otection of Information System Audit Tools

As described in the Horizon (On-Line) Architecture — Support Services (Ref:-
ARC/SVS/ARC/0001) The Audit Data Gathering and Storage facilities must be generic and
extensible; in particular any new applications introduced into the Horizon (Online) system should
interface to the Audit Server.

Tools to extract and prepare data for analysis are provided together with facilities to manage

internal Post Office Account data retrieval activities. Access, by Post Office Account staff, to the
retrieval and extraction facilities is via the user interface provided on the Audit Workstation.

Audit Track data for presentation to Post Office or in support of internal audit activities. The Audit
workstation is dedicated to this task & provides no other facilities.

Browse and filter tools are configured on the Audit Workstation enabling subsequent
