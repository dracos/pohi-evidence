Stephen Dilley has been approached by an Insolvency Practitioner instructed by Castleton. You can read
his comments about yourself.

Castleton has also agreed our total bill for costs in writing which means that we do not have to go to Court
to have them taxed which incurs additional legal costs in its own right. This response also indicates that
Castleton has no intention of appealing against the decision of the Court and that the judgement is the
final comment on the matter.

 As such we need to get on with making as much use of the judgement as possible. Stephen Dilley has
asked for permission to publish an article in a legal journal about the case which I have no objection to as
long as we maintain editorial control as the more publicity the case is given the greater should be its effect
upon postmasters who take legal advice about defending claims for repayment.

Outstanding matters are ;
   communicating the matter to the Fed- agreeing a suitable form of words possibly with the assistance
   of external relations
   arranging a meeting with Fujitsu - finalise the proposed change of words on the trading statement
   before the meeting - find out the cost of the suggested improvement from Fujitsu and estimate the
   cost of implementation across the network
   agreeing with the auditors that they will formally ask for, examine and refer to at least three months
   worth of branch trading statements on each audit,copies of which are to be attached to their reports

A charge obtained voluntarily over his share of the matrimonial house and a voluntary sale would be the
most cost effective method of obtaining repayment of some of our outlay whilst minimising further costs.
