2. Scope

The purpose of this document is to ensure that a
consistent, controlled write off process is deployed
across all Open Item Managed Accounts (matched).

In order to clear down these G/L accounts, teams may need
to perform three types of write off.

e The ad hoc write off of individual open items that
cannot be resolved following the usual investigative
process.

o For example; matching with client files shows
an error, but there is no error in the branch.
Value is over the maintained error limit.
Normal investigations do not find a resolution,
decision taken to write off the unmatched
error.

e The ad hoc clearance of aged open items
o For example; transactions requiring

investigation from over 1 year, all relating to
one product. The volume of these items is
preventing P&BA from resolving all current
issues in a timely manner, which means that the
backlog is continuing to grow. One solution
would be to write off all items that are in
‘backlog’.

e The regular write off of open items, which fall
below the agreed low value tolerance for the product
(“maintained errors”).

Page 4 of 25
Write Off Process

o For example; lp error on a, A&L transaction.
Would cost more to investigate the error,
therefore, a maintained error write off would

be made automatically.

It should be noted that this cannot be applied to
differences visible to the Branch.

The p
regar

Extract from OLA document

urpose of this is to provide the principles for with
ds to Losses write offs,

If timescales have been met by Product & Branch
Accounting then default is for all losses to be
charged to Network and to Product budgets

If timescales have not been met by Product & Branch
Accounting, default is to charge to P&BA budgets

If postings originate from Horizon as in the case of
Crown office losses / gains and Transaction
corrections and retail line write off, these will
automatically be charged to the Network

If Product & Branch Accounting makes a decision on
disputes, then the default is to charge to P&BA
budgets

Aged debt outside of the current financial year
should be charged to P&BA budgets.

In the event of dispute, and only as last resort,
Finance Analysis to mediate on whose budget

P&BA will operate the attached write off process to
ensure that all steps have been followed before
write off.

Write Off Process

4 Decision Making Process

Before the write off is processed a decision needs to be
made as to which area of Post Office Ltd the write off
will be posted to; Network, Product, Cash Services, P&BA
or Central Finance. This process only covers Ad-Hoc Write
Offs and not those for which no manual intervention is
required.

Before write off to Product or Network, Team Leaders
should have a discussion with the relevant business
partner, which is noted on Appendix A.

4.1 Decision 1 Write off to Network
If the decision is to write off to the Network, then the
Profit Centre used should be the Branch FAD code. For
relevant business partner please contact Relationship
Manager, currently, Andy Winn.

4.2 Decision 2 Write off to Product
If the decision is to write off to the Product, the
appropriate Product Profit Centre must be used, not the
Branch FAD Code - please refer to Appendix C.

4.3 Decision 3 Write off to Security

If the decision is to write off to Security, Profit
Centre 981999 must be used, not the Branch FAD Code.

4.4 Decision 4 Write off to Cash Services
Write offs for Cash Services are managed by the Cash
Depot or Cash Centre. The Finance Team at the depot or
Cash Centre will make the postings to SAPADS/POLFS as
applicable. For reference purposes only, Cash Services
Profit Centres are attached in Appendix D.

4.5 Decision 5 Write off to P&BA

If the decision is to write off to P&BA, Profit Centre
950999 must be used.

4.6 Decision 6 Write off to Central Finance

If the decision is to write off to Central Finance,
Profit Centre 950999 must be used, not Profit Centre 1.

be held there pending client/customer/Branch enquiries

a minimum this will be the following;
