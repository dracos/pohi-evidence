(b) The CFO introduced the ARA focussing on the following key points:

(c) The Accounts. The numbers in the accounts are almost finalised
with a few revenue procedures to complete. The CFO explained the
approach to capital expenditure impairment which had been

an opportunity for more flexible approach to disclosures in the ARA.

assumed a much higher level of profitable Government revenue.
