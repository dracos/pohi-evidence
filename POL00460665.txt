Jane, This situation has now moved beyond a Sunday evening chat. My patience has expired. There has been no
progress since we discussed the matter over Teams on 13/01. You have now forced me to seek advice, which I
have done this weekend. I think you and Henry have some urgent thinking to do or, to quote Henry, 'we will end
up in a real self made mess’. Nick
