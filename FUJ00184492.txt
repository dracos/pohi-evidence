I have amended our standard WS form, have removed references to ARQs amongst other things that are not relevant
to the data supplied to you.
So this statement has not been used before in its current form.

Andy,
It looks OK to me; it may include more information than is required regarding the solution overview, but looks like it
contains everything they need.

Dave, Pete, OK for this to be sent to WBD, who I expect will remove anything they don’t want and re-template it, or
does it need to go past our legal people first?

I'd explain to them that this is the form of statement that has been used before when providing a witness statements
for prosecutions.

Hi Matthew,
Attached is a witness statement which I believe covers the data that I supplied to you as a result of your request on
the 34 Oct 2018. Can you let me know if this is suitable.

Thanks,
