2 MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
2.1 Summary

End to End testing originated from the requirement to test some of
the longer business processes i.e. 3 week cash account, and to ensure
that data integrity was maintained throughout the system

‘ environment. Using lower volumes and including more exception
tests than the Model Office Test, an agreed plan was generated and
scripted by the Horizon test team, with input from all parties ice.
CAPS, TIP, HAPS, OBCS and POCL RDP.

The final pass of End to End was the culmination of earlier passes,
which achieved their test objectives to an extent. However,
throughout the earlier passes some areas of functionality were not
available in the build being used for the test, and other areas fell short
of the expected functionality.

Prior to the commencement of the final pass, to provide sufficient
confidence that the software was stable enough to enter the End to
End and Model Office testing final passes, an additional 6 - day pre-
proving exercise took place. Two runs of the 6 - day test were
performed and were deemed as successful.

Lessons learrit from previous passes of End to End were implemented
prior to the commencement of the final pass. These were:

e A reduction in the volume of transactions entered onto the
Horizon counter throughout the cycle.

e Additional information on areas which had previously been
unclear i.e. 3 week cash account, BES recovery etc.

e Expected results for each Stock Unit and Office Balance for each
day of the cycle e.g. all transactions were reconciled to the office
balance each day.

e Additional checking of the input data versus the output reports
and summaries. This was performed on the day following the day
of input.

As a result of the work performed by all parties between End to End
2nd pass and the commencement of the final pass, in ensuring that the
test data and environment would support the cycle, the final pass was
performed with fewer issues than previous cycles. The main
differences were:

¢ The cycle ran day - for - day to the end with no slippage -

¢ There was a reduction in invalid incidents raised

Version Draft 0.1 Page 6 of 73 Date 29/03/99

POL00028419
POL00028419

End to End Testing Evaluation Report for Nile Release 2.0

¢. Test results were proven at a higher success rate i.e. higher % of
scripts run and passed

* Test conditions were identified prior to the cycle and tracked
during the cycle

¢ Incident management was resourced adequately, which assisted
all parties to monitor the current position at'any given time

¢ Incident management processes had an improved structure, which
included the involvement of Horizon Product Management for
Business impact assessment

* Reconciliation of transactions across different Business boundaries
was possible,. including POCL and. BA back end systems e.g.
CBDB (POCL), PACS (BA) and BSU (Pathway).

Throughout the final pass issues were identified by all parties. Some
issues where remedied and re-tested’ within the cycle ie. POCL
reference data drop to change the Cash Account type from London to
Provincial. It was necessary to apply fixes to the counter environment
to either move forward, or to improve the quality of the test results
ie. the incorrect cash account mapping for a stock item would have
caused mis-balancing Cash Accounts in-all offices.

In all, the final pass of End to End was successful, in that, the ‘key’
tests contained within the test plan were executed as planned, and
incidents have been raised for failed tests. The incidents which have
been assessed by the partners including Horizon Product
Management, and a greater impact on the live environment during
the ‘live trial’ period have been planned for targeted testing.

2.2 Conclusion

End to End Testing final pass achieved the test phase objectives as
defined in the Testing Approach Document.

.The ability to maintain day for day running was achieved by careful
management and communication between all parties.

Ongoing reviews of incidents-throughout the cycle have enabled -

decisions to be made with regard to the status of each incident i.e.
when a fix or change will be required.-This process has led to a short
cycle of targeted testing which will witness those incidents regarded
by each sponsor organisation as a risk to the live trial. Outstanding
_ incidents are under discussion for inclusion on the Known Problem

Register (KPR).

3 INTRODUCTION
3.1 Background

End to End Testing was originally scoped from tests that were
required for inclusion in the Model Office Test, but would have
increased the cycle length beyond that previously agreed with BA
(CAPS).

The plan for End to End was for two rehearsal cycles and a final pass.
Each rehearsal incurred slippage, as the system functionality, test data
and scripts did not fully support the test. Between the second
rehearsal and the final pass, time was used for the application and
testing of PinICL fixes, by Pathway, pre-proving of some of the fixes,
by Horizon and CAPS. There was also an opportunity for the
Horizon test team and CAPS to revisit the test script, with a view to
improving the quality of the tests and in particular the expected
results. :

3.2 Purpose

The purpose of this report is to provide details of the tests performed,
the results achieved, and conclusions drawn from the phase.

3.3 Scope

The scope of this report is Nile Release 2, End to End Testing, Final
pass only.

3.4 Test Objectives

As described in the Horizon Testing Approach document [1], the
objectives of the End to End Final pass are as follows:

“E2E will be planned for a low volume of transactions, which
specifically test End to End business processes, which are too lengthy
and complex to be performed within the timeframe and structure of
“MOT. Whilst ensuring that the integrity of the data remains intact
when all systems interface on the same environment.”

4.21 Pathway Domain

The. test environment within the Pathway domain comprised of a
Release 2 datacentre with links to all external systems.

Gateway PC's, for the transmission of data to remote sites, were
located at Farnborough, Huthwaite, and de La Rue, Tewkesbury.

Access to the Payment Card Helpline was made via a Helpdesk PC
simulator located at the Pathway site rather than via telephone to
Girobank.

4.2.2 Test Office Configurations

The Test Offices used during End to End final pass comprised of 8
Post Offices, of these:

¢ 1non-automated - for BES Helpdesk transactions only

¢ 2 were migrated from ECCO+ using the MiECCO migration tool,
and also had electronic scales attached

¢. 5 were migrated from manual offices using the MiMAN migration
tool.

¢ Offices were connected to the Correspondence Server via:
¢ LAN connection (3)
e ISDN (2)
¢ Frame Relay (2)

e A variety of Regions were included in the configurations including
Welsh and Northern Ireland office types.

The test counters comprised of Pentium II processors, with 64 Mb
RAM and a combination of Flatscreen and standard touchscreen
monitors. Full security lock-down was not applied, as agreed, to
enable Pathway to manage the day to day running of the
environment.

43 Software baseline

The software release was the MOT baseline (9 increment 7.2) [3], with

_ some additional changes made to this baseline during the cycle (See
[2] for details). The changes were agreed by the relevant testing
partners prior to being applied.

44 Summary of system functionality
The following applications formed part of the testing baseline:

4.4.1 Areas covered within End to End

In conjunction with the system applications noted above, the
following ‘key’ areas of functionality were included within the tests
performed during the final pass:

¢ Migration from manual accounting and ECCO offices, using the
relevant migration tools. Tests included both ‘clean’ Cash Account
and ‘mid-week’ Cash Account migrations.

e Extended Cash Account period - using the option of 3 weeks
¢ . BES Recovery

¢ OBCS stops and recalls

Use of the counter when the LAN connection has failed

¢ Long term Office closure - the movement of cards and payments
to a different ‘nominated’ office.

¢ Temporary Tokens and Urgent Payments

¢ Multiple benefit types -. Child Benefit (ChB), Job Seekers
Allowance (JSA) and Income Support (IS). This area included a
combination of payee roles i.e. Standard Beneficiary, Permanent
Agent, Appointee, Card and Uncarded Casual Agents. It should
be noted that the tests relating to multiple benefit types were
outside the scope of the release being tested. The decision to
include Child Benefit as the only benefit type was made shortly
before the commencement of the first rehearsal. As it would have
taken too long to amend the test packs of both Horizon and CAPS,
it was agreed by all parties for the scope to remain as originally
planned. ‘

e POCL Reference Data changes - these tests were included to test
the reaction of the changes at the counter, including the
revaluation of products, and also the reaction of the changed
reference data between Pathway and TIP i.e. changes sent to both
systems from POCL RDP are aligned when implemented.

4.

¢ Removal of the ISDN line for more than 10 days - this test was to
ensure that BES transactions, held on the counter for a period
longer than the 10 day reconciliation statement can account for,
are placed on the relevant reports and can be reconciled by BSU,
TIP and PACS.

¢ Losses and Gains, including error notice processing at the counter.

¢ Standard EPOSS, AP, OBCS and BES transactions being keyed to
counter throughout the cycle to populate daily, weekly, stock unit
and office reports arid client summaries, including the Cash
Account.

¢ Cash Accounts were produced at various times throughout the
cycle. These were planned specifically to test the integrity of Cash
accounts when produced at unexpected times i.e. not aligned with
the Cash account calendar which determines when Postmasters
should produce the office weekly account. Such tests included:

e the Cash Account calendar file containing a short week and a
long week

¢ 3-week cash account period from week 52 to week 03
e rolling over the office from week 52 to week 01

¢ producing a Cash account when the LAN between 2 counters
is disconnected

¢ producing a Cash account when the ISDN line is disconnected
¢ Postmaster does not produce a Cash Account for 2 weeks

e All Cash Accounts were processed by CBDB, including the 2
week 04 cash accounts which were produced as a result of re-
planned tests. These were produced by agreement of the
relevant parties

All data was passed to the relevant systems each day for
processing, using usual business processes to achieve expected
results.

5.

1.1 Planned Schedule

End to End final pass was scheduled to run across the following ‘key’
dates:

08/12 Feb - System set-up and loading of input data, including
delivery of BES cards

13 Feb - Migrate 3 manual offices to Release 2 using MiMAN

14 Feb - Perform BES and OBCS transactions which had been
scheduled for Days 1 - 5 in a previous plan. These days were
subsequently removed along with the datacentre migration activity,
however, the transactions were required to be executed before Day
8 to keep the expected results aligned.

15 Feb - 12 March - Execution of the test plan at the counter,
including transmission of data to external systems.

13 March - 17 March - Final processing of data and reconciliation at
the ‘back end’ systems, and system clear down where applicable.

1.2 Actual Schedule

The schedule was executed as planned, with no slippage incurred.

6 OBSERVATIONS
6.1 Training Issues

The Horizon training event was attended by all members of the
Horizon Test Team and all test operators who executed the test
scripts during the final pass. There is a unanimous view that the
training event, as presented to the End to End team, will not be
sufficient to equip ‘real’ end users in readiness for their offices
receiving the Horizon system.

The course was thought to be too short, with too little time to reflect
on areas being demonstrated. The course handout booklet was not
referred to enough to sufficiently familiarise the user with the book
for when they return to their office.

More time should be allowed for the more complex areas of Stock
Unit Balancing, and office accounting, as the concept of an automated
system will be new to many users.

The trainers will require a deeper knowledge of POCL processes,
including those that require the interaction of POCL users, Customers
and BA i.e. when Customers should be referred to the local BA office
etc. This knowledge will be necessary to deal with the variety of
questions they will be asked.

6.2 Counter processes

Throughout End to End testing, the following observations were
made in relation to the counter.

6.2.1 Shared Stock Unit Balancing

The concept of shared stock unit balancing will be new to most of the
users. Although the system functionality works as designed, it is nota
user friendly process to follow and could lead to a confused state at
the counter.

The procedures and training will need to be clear with regard to
backing out of problems and best practices to follow for ease of use.

6.2.2 Losses and Gains

Again, the system functionality does support the process of
accounting for losses and gains between stock units and the suspense
account. However, use should be made aware that, in posting a loss
or gain to suspense, there will be a subsequent loss or gain visible on

Version Draft 0.1 Page 15 of 73 Date 29/03/99

POL00028419
POL00028419

End to End Testing Evaluation Report for Nile Release 2.0

the stock unit for the next accounting week. This does clear following
a stock unit balance, but it could lead to confusion.

6.3 Support Throughout the Cycle

Lessons learnt from the rehearsal cycles led to changes in
communication and support mechanisms. These played an important
part in achieving a cleaner cycle, and it is worth noting what the
changes were.

« Pathway provided full time support at the counter to resolve
issues and queries. This helped with the analysis of incidents
when raised, as the Pathway support person was close to the
problem when it occurred. It also reduced the amount of incidents
being raised when there was no fault.

¢ CAPS provided two members of their team to support End to End
final pass. This level of support improved the management of the
tests cases, and the communication between Horizon and CAPS
when issues arose.

¢ The Horizon testing team had spent time reducing the volume of
transactions throughout the test plan. Expected results were
tighter, and the communication between Horizon and TIP during
the preparation of the scripts assisted in the checking of expected
results both at TIP and on the counter.

¢ Finally, the daily progress meetings were invaluable for keeping
all parties together on the schedule, but also for providing
continuous updates on outstanding incidents, which gave the
entire group a better understanding of the serious issues, and the
status of the cycle at that time.

Office A has had its Cash Account extended to CAP 4,

encashment is made during this extended Cash
Account period and recovered incorrectly onto

will search for a date in CAP 4 and display the
message "The Date entered is not in the current

E.G. PCHL encashment made today 02/04/97,
recovered incorrectly and today’s date input

17/04/97 onwards as this is the CAP it believes the

IR 470 23086 E2EFP - Contingency File Error Reporting Medium
08/03/1999 15:57:04 - By Peter Ashley

On Day 25 of End to End Final Pass a Contingency file
was produced by

Pathway, for Service 2 (CPD5) and sent to CAPS.
Pathway's Outward Control

log shows successful validation by CAS and CAPS,
with a status 40 (File fully

accepted) being issued by CAPS on 04/03/99 at 15:49.
CAS has since updated

the status 40 to 99 (Entry complete, awaiting deletion
by CAS Housekeeping).

On 08/03/99 Pathway received an error file (Type 20)
for the Service 2

Contingency file. The error file contains the following
CAPS errors: 14026,

14027, 14028 and 14029; all relate to reconciliation

failures.
The type 20 file is unexpected. Errors are reported
following the status 30
entry in the control log.
IR 478 23097 During End to End Final Pass an examination of the I Medium

PASCMS database prior to the contingency

made in CAPS fallback

In this case the Contingency payments process would
have decided that an authorised payment would be
created for the agent but not for the beneficiary (since
they were EOI). This would result in the beneficiary
not being present in the CAPS payments contingency
file. A CAS validation failure would result. The
original rules dictated that payments were invalid if
the beneficiary could not encash and did not have an
appointee (as in this case). No authorised payment
should therefore have been made to either the
Beneficiary, or any payment_payee.

The matter was passed to Tony Haywood for
comment and he responded with the following:

1, Payment made to beneficiary (encash_by_ben = 'Y')
and permanent agent, (which I believe is an invalid
business scenario). The beneficiary can encash but
has decided they want a Permanent Agent who can
encash on their behalf.

2. Beneficiary made EOI. Beneficiary is made CMS
EOI for two main reasons - either death or an
Appointee is set up. In both cases CAPS will
immediately recall (Stop) any uncollected payments
for both Beneficiary and the Permanent Agent. The
payment stops will remove the payments from the
mandate table.

3. Contingency payments made in CAPS fallback. The
payments have been removed from the mandates
table, thus there will be no Contingency payments to
either the Beneficiary nor to the Permanent Agent.
The scenario was invalid simply in that when the
Beneficiary is made CMS EOI, all outstanding
payments are stopped.

then able to return to "A" and make the encashment.

"remove" was replaced with "void", also, if the
customer at "A" was making encashments in more
than one payee role which payment would have to be
removed or would all pyments be affected.

Finally on attempting to "perform the payment again"
we found that a BES lock had been applied to the
payment, as a result the payment could not be
encashed for a further 30-mins. This is not customer

today we were expecting the system to display a
message prompting that "This batch of cards has been
stopped..." at the point of the batch code being input.
This did not happen, but on reconciling the cards the
system did prompt that the individual cards had been
stopped.

We were informed that the system was working as
designed, but after further reflection, and having
spoken to the BES Product Manager, we would still
like the batch to be displayed as "Stopped" at the
point of the batch code being input.

An example of why we would like this change to be
made would be: The time wasted by a stopped batch
containing 50 cards arriving at an Office and the clerk
having to receive the cards.

number of HIGH incidents, of which all are included within Target
Testing.

However the success rate of the planned test conditions along with
the complexity of the tests within E2E, and the inclusion of multiple
benefit types ie. JSA, IS and ChB, have proved this area of

input (unchanged) on SUPF138 the previous day.
<<< Full details available on original incident >>>

BSU 16 22959 PSR115 for transaction on 7/4/99 reports various 320 I Medium
exceptions. These are known as recovered EPOSS
orphans because they have not been matched to a
corresponding BES orphan created during fallback. In
every case on this report the 320 exceptions have date
entered in the fallback field of the report. How can this
be if an unmatched EPOSS orphan should only have a
date in the recovery field? (BES orphans are reported
correctly as in their case the recovery field is blank and
Fallback field does have a date in it.)

BSU 15 22796 On SUPF138 (maintain adjusted encashments screen), I Medium
encashment number 5050380100001260 has no
encashment details. The PAS exception code is 18, and
there should be encashment details returned from the
counter, together with encashed payments.

There is also an encashed payment on SUPF138
(6050380100001269) which is not reported as suspended
on PMSR105 or PMSR100/101. This needs to be
investigated.

PMSR116 (dated 12/04/97) reported as cleared all the
fallback and recovery exceptions which were
previously on PMSR115. However, the following errors
were detected: -

1- Where the PCHL encashment was voided, PMSR116
included a value. this is incorrect as the value should be
Zero (as itis on PMSR115)

2- For EPOSS orphans and BES orphans, BAD records
should be sent to TIP once the exceptions have been
cleared, yet in the column 'BAD to TIP' on PMSR116, all
of the indicators are set to 'N'. However, Linda Austin
has confirmed that BAD records were received by TIP

8 CLOSED INCIDENTS
Issue Ref. I PinICL Description Priority

BSU08 IN/A PMSR115 (dated 07/04/97) reports several fallback and I High
recovery exceptions, due to the ISDN line for office
505038 being connected for the first time. PMSR115 has
not reported these exceptions correctly. The following
errors have been detected: -

Some encashments have resulted in an EPOSS orphan
(code 320) as well as a status mismatch (310) and an
amount mismatch (300). Codes 300 and 310 mean that
both the EPOSS and the BES transactions have been
found with corresponding encashment IDs, the only
difference being in the amount and/or the status of the
transaction. we would therefore not expect to see an
EPOSS orphan in this case, as it suggests that the BES
encashment has not been sent to the counter, thus
contradicting a code 310 and 300.

There is a case of a 310 being reported without a 300.
The transaction ID for the 310 is 5050389900000214, and
the PCHL status is void, while the counter has
recovered the transaction as cashed. This should have
also resulted in an amount mismatch.

A series of BES and EPOSS orphans have been received
. Some can be matched by the NINO, the amount and
the status. The only field that differs is the fallback date.
This suggests that the fallback dates which have been
reported are erroneous.

There are three EPOSS orphans reported on PMSR115
on 07/04/97, and they are also reported as cleared on
PMSR116 on the same day. This should not happen and
requires investigating.

This incident must be given the 1 - Highest priority as
the above problems have prevented us form reconciling
TIP with CBOS, and this is not acceptable to ICL
Pathway or our sponsors.

Should the system invoke card impounds for both cards
during a Carded Casual Agent transaction if one of the
cards has been previously stopped?-

Case C2 NINO
On attempting to perform a CCA ‘encashment using
these cards, one of the cards had been previously
unknowingly impounded (due to the same problem
being raised now). When this card was swiped the
system displayed the card impound screen and allowed
the user to print a receipt and/or continue. On selecting
"Continue" it was noticed that the system then displays
acard impound screen showing the details for the other
card (this was missed previously because the screen
changes quite quickly and the user thought that they
had not selected "Continue" originally".

The question is, should the fact that one of the cards

had been previously impounded result in the other
card being impounded?

The only scenario I can think of that should result in
both cards being impounded is if EVP is invoked and
failed.
