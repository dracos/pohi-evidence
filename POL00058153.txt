Subject: CASE NO 22796 - Prosecution of Lynette Jane Hutchings - POLTD/1112/0007
Attachments: ATTNOTEdoc01011720120731 112356. pdf
Steve,

Please find attached a copy of Will Martin's Attendance Note. Lynette Hutchings
pleaded guilty to false accounting and her case has been listed for sentencing on 24th
August 2012. Will Martin has been booked to attend on behalf of the Post Office Ltd on
that date.

I would be grateful if you could let me have a schedule of investigation costs in advance
of the 24th August 2012

I note from my file that Graham Brander said in his memo of 7th March 2012 that the
sum of £9743.76 was outstanding. Could you let me know if it remains the case that the

sum is outstanding and if so, let me have a draft form of order under $18 POCA which
we can invite the court to make on the next occasion.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.

Kind regards,

Martin.
