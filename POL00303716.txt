Subject: Changing branch data [BD-4A.FID20472253]

Rodric

As discussed, below are the questions on POL/Fujitsu changing branch data. It may be worth having a quick con call
with Fujitsu to run through these.

The following challenge has been put to POL by Second Sight:

"the Andy Winn/Alan Lusher email in the case of Ward [...] explicitly states that Fujitsu can remotely change the
figures in the branches without the SPMs’ knowledge or authority".

The Winn/Lusher email is attached. The part of the email in question is:
“Fujitsu have the ability to impact branch records via the message store but have extremely rigorous procedures in

place to prevent adjustments being made without prior authorisation - within POL and Fujitsu these controls form the
core of our court defence if we get to that stage.”

POL00303716

Questions:
1. Can Post Office change branch transaction data without a subpostmaster being aware of the change?
2. Can Fujitsu change branch transaction data without a subpostmaster being aware of the change?
3. If not, where is the evidence for this conclusion?
4. Ifso:

a) How does this happen?

b) Why was this functionality built into the system design?

c) Why would Fujitsu need to use this functionality?

d) What controls are in place to prevent the unauthorised use of this method of access?
e) When has branch data been accessed in this way in the past?

5. In relation to the Winn/Lusher email:

a) What is "message store"?

b) Can this be used to access and change branch records?

c) What is the "impact" of this change on branch records?

d) Would the subpostmaster be aware of this change?

e) Why would this method of access be used?

f) What controls are in place to prevent misuse of this method of access?

6. In light of the above, is the following statement correct? "It is impossible for either POL or Fujitsu to change
branch transaction data without the knowledge of a subpostmaster"

Kind regards
Andy
