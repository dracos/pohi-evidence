POST OFFICE LIMITED v DAVID CHARLES BLAKEY
SUB POST OFFICE ASSISTANT, RIBY SQUARE SPSO
CASE NO: 0405/0172

Read and noted, thank you.

In my opinion there is sufficient evidence to afford a realistic prospect of
conviction of Mr Blakey for an offence of theft with a low prospect of success and
for false accounting with a high prospect of success. Clearly in the absence of
any admissions from Mr Blakey for theft of the £64,435.24, then we will need to
eliminate the involvement of Mrs Blakey and other members of staff, and they
will need to give evidence (if they can do so) to implicate Mr Blakey in the
preparation of the inputs of all the daily figures for the Office on the Horizon
system and that each week he completes the Office balance and subsequently
produces and signs the weekly cash account and the other members of staff do
not perform any of the accounting procedures at the Office. This has been
accepted by David Blakey. This fact needs to be confirmed in witness
statements. The witnesses will need to confirm that they did not steal cash or
falsify the accounts. Once we can get these statements, then I would confirm
that there would be a good prospect of success to prosecute Mr Blakey for theft.
The case will further be strengthened by the further enquiries which are in hand
in relation to his finances.

As stated above, once the evidence is forthcoming from other members of staff
then I consider it would be appropriate to proceed by way of summons in this
case.

This case is, in my opinion, more suitable for trial in the Crown Court. When the
decision has been taken please obtain summonses.

No further statements need be obtained at this stage.

If the Defendant should elect trial or if the Magistrates refuse jurisdiction or if a
Not Guilty plea is entered the Officer should obtain and associate all necessary
statements and exhibits. I list below the statements which appear to be

necessary in this case, but the Officer should also consider whether there are
any other areas which can usefully be covered and include any other evidence.
