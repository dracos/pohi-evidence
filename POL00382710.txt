Hi Michael

Please find attached the following documentation:

The TOR for the Programme which Kevin is in the process of finalising

Draft TORs for the work streams (with the exception of Detica) that we are in the process of validating

The “as-is” experience that we have mapped following the engagement with the stakeholders
The “to-be” experience that we have mapped

FRPP

Hope they make sense. Please shout if you need anything answering.

I'll get something done for the meeting on Friday and get this over to you by tomorrow.
Thanks

Hi Gayle

It would be really useful to understand the TORs for each of the workstreams under the Business Improvement
Programme before I meet with Angela, I was hoping to meet her later this week — would you be able to send me the
TOR’s by Wednesday?

Thanks

Michael

Subject: Business Improvement Programme Board Slides

Hi all

Please find attached the slide deck we went through at the Programme Board today.

As discussed, once Kevin agrees the Terms of Reference we will be establishing a revised governance with the
Programme Board which will largely consist of Exco members. The intention is that we will still meet as a work-stream
group to discuss the specific activities that the work streams are delivering.

Our priority is to construct the business case which will need every work stream owner to ensure the deliverables are
identified along with the associated benefits and the required implementation plan. I will be giving everyone a call over
the next day or so to ensure that the requested workshops to facilitate these are in place.

If you have any questions in the meantime, please don’t hesitate to ask.

Thanks

Gayle
