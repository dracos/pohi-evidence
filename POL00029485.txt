that the SAP* account had a last login date
during the audit period and that the DDIC
account is associated to the S_A.SYSTEM
privileged profile.

Refer to Appendix A for detail on the accounts
identified to have privileged access to POLSAP.

HNGX

We understand that Fujitsu has undertaken actions
to investigate some of the inappropriate privileged
access identified from last year’s audit, however the
prior year observations noted below for HNGX were
still valid at the time our review.

e There are inappropriate system privileges
assigned to the APPSUP role and
SYSTEM_MANAGER role at the Oracle
database level on the Branch Database server
(BDB) supporting HNGX.

«There is inappropriate privilegedaccess atthe
Oracle database level on the Transaction
Processing System/server (DAT) supporting
HNGX:

o Systenyprivileges assigned to the APPSUP
role and OPS$TPS account are
inappropriate.

o The following accounts associated to the
DBA role are no longer required:

= CFM_DBA
= SPLEX_ROLE_BOTH.
o The following accounts have inappropriate

SAP_NEW access is performed to gain
assurance that no inappropriate or
unauthorised activity has been performed
which may adversely impact the financial
statements.

Management should implement
monitoring controls to help ensure that
controls operated by the third party
service providers are in place and are in
operation, for example, monitoring of
appropriateness of access to privileged
users/profiles.

© access to user administration functionality

Unrestricted access to privileged IT functions
increases the risk of unauthorised/inappropriate

activities which may lead to the processing of
unauthorised or erroneous transactions.

User
administration
process

Our examination of the processes for the creation,
modification and removal of users’ access showed
the following:

HNGX

« There was no evidence to support the
authorisation of the creation of one user account
selected for our walkthrough.

* The termination date for the leaver we selected
for our walkthrough was 06/05/11 whilst the
request to remove the access was raised only on
06/09/11, four months after the leaving date.

e Based on our reconciliation ofthe Fujitsu
terminated employee listing to the Active
Directory listing which controls access to the
HNGxX estate, we noted one terminated
employee whose Active Directory account
remained active.

e There was no evidence to support the
authorisation of the removal of an Active
Directory group membership for one user
account selected for our walkthrough.

We recommend the following
improvements:

HNGX

Strengthen the existing user
administration processes within Fujitsu so
‘that documentation supporting the
request, approval and set-up of access to
the HNGX estate is retained.

POLSAP

Strengthen the existing user
administration process for cash centre
users so that (i) documentation
supporting the request, approval and
set-up of temporary assignment of
access to cash centre users is retained
(ii) cash centre managers are made
aware that permanent access
modifications should follow the
standard user administration process
for supply chain users, where an
authorised SAP ADS access request
form is completed. Furthermore,
management should consider
implementing a monitoring control to
ensure that the process implemented
for assigning temporary access to cash
centre users is being adhered to.

POL00029485
POL00029485

POLSAP

We found a POL employee who left on 04/06/11
but the account remained active up to 23/09/11.
Further investigation showed that this delay was
caused by late notification from the line
manager.

As we observed in the 2010/11 audit, POL cash
centre managers are granted limited access to
user administration in POLSAP through
transaction SU07 allowing them to assign cash
centre profiles to users within their depot. As
such there is a lack of segregation of duties
between the authorisation and granting of access
to cash centre users.

In response to our comments last year, POL has
implemented a process whereby a form is
required to authorise the temporary assignment
of roles to cash centre users and’a monthly
review is performed to check that roles assigned
to cash centre staff do notcreate a segregation
of duties conflict.

However, based.on our walkthrough and,testing
samples of 27/new and modified user access to
POLSAP, we noted 17 users (16 POL users, one
Steria user) where the line manager or cash
centre manager authorising/confirming
appropriateness of accessyalso had access to
user administration on POLSAP.

Based on our sample of 25 instances of new and

modified user access to POLSAP, we noted that:

o The new process noted above was
implemented on 01/10/11. For one out of two

e Implement a monitoring process
around the activities of privileged
users (i.e. cash centre managers with
access to SU01). Where part of the
user administration process is
controlled by third party service
providers, management should ensure
adequate monitoring controls are in
place to help ensure the controls
operateas intended.

HNGX and POLSAP

e Strengthen the revocation of access
process. such that IT is notified in a
timely manner when a terminated
employee no longer requires access to
POLSAP and the HNGX estates.
Consideration should be given to the
HR ‘department sending a list of
terminated employees to the IT
department on a periodic basis, e.g.
weekly or fortnightly. This is in
addition to the line manager notifying
the IT department of the terminated
employee. All documentation
supporting this process should be
retained.

POL00029485
POL00029485

o cash centre modifications which took place
after this date, we noted that this form had
not been retained.

co For one cash centre user modification the
line manager stated that the role had been
assigned permanently, in which case the
modification of access should have followed
the supply chain user administration process
rather than the process for assigning
temporary roles to cash centre users.

e Based on our reconciliation of the Fujitsu and
Post Office terminated employee listings to the
POLSAP user listing we noted four terminated
employees whose user accounts remained
active.

Refer to Appendix B for details of the accounts noted
above.

Failure to maintain appropriate documentation for the
user administration process increases the risk that
accounts with excessive or inappropriate privileges
may exist, therefore increasing the risk of
unauthorised/unnecessary access to systems.
Furthermore, this risk is increased by inadequate
segregation of duties between the approval and
setup of access as well as failure to remove
terminated employees’,access promptly.

Change
management
process

We reviewed the processes,implemented to
determine that all program changes are appropriately
authorised, tested and approved prior to
implementation into the production environment for
the applications in scope. Whilst we noted some
improvements on the process compared to last year,
some of the points raised last year have not been
fully remediated. Specifically, we noted the following

Management should seek to enhance the
current change management
process/policy further to include:

* The level of documentation to be
retained to evidence that POL is
involved in authorisation, testing and
approving changes made to the

POL00029485
POL00029485

POLSAP

Based on a sample of 17 changes made to the
POLSAP production environment during the audit
period we noted:

For six changes, whilst we were able to obtain
evidence that the changes had been tested by
Fujitsu, the name of the person who performed
the testing was not recorded

For four changes, whilst we were able to obtain
evidence of approval from the POL Change
Control team, the name of the person who
approved the change to go live from POL was
not recorded

For two changes, we noted that POL initiated the
change but the name of the Product and Branch
Accounting (P&BA) team member who logged
the call was not recorded

For one change, we were unable to obtain
evidence that the change had been authorised
by POL or Fujitsu prior to development

For one change, we were unable to obtain
evidence that ityhad been approved by POL prior
to deployment into the production environment.

Whilst we have been advised that POL is not usually
involved in testing fixes or maintenance changes, we
have noted from the samples of changes made to
POLSAP that POL has tested one out of ten changes
of this nature.

be retained to promote accountability.
This will provide management
reasonable assurance that program

specifically business user testing of
fixes and maintenance changes to the
in scope applications. The change

should also describe the overall
manage change process

Management should implement
monitoring controls to help ensure that
controls operated by the third party

POL00029485

Based on our walkthrough and testing samples of 11

back end changes, 11 counter changes and six

manual changes made to the live HNGX estate
during the audit period, we noted the following:

e For two manual changes and three back end
changes, although POL approval was recorded in
the Manage Service Change (MSC) system prior
to implementation, the name of the member of
the POL Change Control team who provided the
approval was not recorded.

e For 28 changes we were unable to obtain
evidence of testing performed by POL where 19
changes relate to maintenance changes made by
Fujitsu (e.g. anti-virus updates, standard platform
build, branch/router configurations, security
upgrades, infrastructure changes)

e For one change we were unable to obtain
evidence of testing performed by Fujitsu.

e For one change we were unable to obtain
evidence of POL approval prior to:
implementation in the live environment.

There is an increased risk that unauthorised and
inappropriate changes are.deployed if they are not
adequately authorised, tested and,approved. prior to
migration to the production environment and
documentation supporting these controls is not

retained.
Periodic user IT In the 2010/11 audit we recommended Management should consider the
access improvements to the periodic user access review implementation of a POL owned periodic
reviews and process and monitoring controls. Whilst we have review of appropriateness of access to in-

POL00029485

HNGX

Whilst we have been advised that there is a new
process in place this year for the periodical review of
the appropriateness of access assigned to the HNGX
estate, we understand that this is based on a
database that records access granted and
terminated, rather than on user access listings
generated directly from Active Directory, which
diminishes the effectiveness of the control.

Our user appropriateness review identified one user
account that no longer required access to HNGX
(refer to Appendix C).

POLSAP

Whilst we note that there is a process in place to
review the appropriateness of P&BA and Supply
Chain users’ access to POLSAP onva periodic basis,
sufficient evidence of the review has not been
retained.

Conflicts in segregation of duties and excessive or
inappropriate access to financial systems may arise
if a regular re-validation of user access is not
performed.

segregation of duties conflicts. In addition,
this will act as an additional control to help
detect users that no longer require access
to the financial applications.

The following outlines how this process
may be implemented:

e User listings,containing all active
users anditheir access levels to be
generated by IT and.emailed to
relevant department managers
whereby they provide responses
detailing:

© Whether the current access of
their employees is in line with
their job,role

.o. Whether any users require their
access be modified or removed.
Where additional access is
required requests should be made
through the existing user
modification process. Where
access is required to be removed,
flagging these users and providing
comments is sufficient. These
responses should be actioned by
IT on a timely basis.

e All documentation to support the
operation of these controls should be
retained, including:

o Emails to managers requesting
responses
o Responses from managers

detailing whether changes are
required (responses should be

POL00029485
POL00029485

o provided whether changes are.
required or not)

o Overall signoff on the completion
of the review from management.

The above review should include all user
accounts including those privileged user
accounts owned.by IT and vendors. In
addition, the individual responsible for
performing the review should have limited
access to the application in, order to
prevent the review of their own access.

ln'terms of monitoring privileged access,
management should specifically consider
implementing a periodic review of users
with privileged/access to IT functions
within the HNGX estate.

Evidence to support the operation of the
above monitoring controls for privileged IT
access should also be retained to support
accountability and provide assurance to
POL management.

Generic
privileged
accounts

Our review of privileged access to the in-scope
applications and theirsupporting infrastructurelast
year revealed individuals sharing password to
multiple generic’ privileged accounts. The same
observation remains valid this year at the time of our
review:

« The password to the privileged SYSTEM account
on the Oracle database.on the BDB and DAT
servers supporting HNGX is known to four of the
11 members of the IRE11 TST DBA team and
the password to the same account on the XID
and R3D servers supporting SAP XI and

Management should consider a review of
generic privileged accounts across the in-
scope applications and their supporting
infrastructure to determine whether such
accounts can be replaced with individual
user accounts to promote accountability.

Management should also consider
implementing monitoring controls to help
ensure robust security practices are in
place particularly those operated by third
party service providers.

The password to the privileged DBA account on
the Oracle database on the BDB and DAT
servers supporting HNGX is known to the RMGA
Unix team and four of the 11 members of the
IRE11 TST DBA team respectively. The
password to the DBA account on the XID and
R3D Oracle database servers supporting SAP XI
and POLSAP applications is known to the three
members of the SAP Basis team.

The password to the privileged SYS default

Password
parameters

We reviewed the password configurations for the in-

scope applications and the infrastructure supporting

these applications. Whilst our examination revealed
some improvements to the observations raised from
last year’s audit, the following observations remain
open:

e We reviewed the password configurations for the
in-scope applications against Fujitsu’s RMGA
Security Policy and Post Office's Information
Security Guide. We noted the following password
parameters have not been defined:

RMGA Security Policy

« Reset accountlockout counter
* — Idle session timeout

Post Office Information Security Guide
* Account lockout threshold

« Reset account lockout counter

« Account lockout duration

* — Idle session timeout.

We also noted that there are password setting
weaknesses within the RMGA Information
Security Policy:

Whist we acknowledged that password
weaknesses. in the applicationy operating
system and database level/are mitigated
to somesextent by the network Active
Directory password controls, the following
is still recommended to further strengthen
the control environment

a) Review and update the ‘RMG
Information Security Policy’ to meet
the recommended generally-accepted
practice password settings outlined
below. Management should also
consider having only one policy
document outlining the password
guidelines that apply to both HNGX
and POLSAP

b) Configure all network, application and
supporting infrastructure components
in line with the policy requirements.
For infrastructure supporting the
applications in scope, where the
critical authentication level is at the
POLSAP application layer or Active
Directory, management should
consider the risk of unauthorised
access to the financial data by

scope identified certain logical security weaknesses.
From our review this year, we noted that these
weaknesses are still valid. These include:

e For the Oracle database supporting SAP XI (XID)
and the Branch Database server (BDB), and
Transaction Processing System server (DAT)
Oracle databases supporting HNGX, we noted
that the password for the LISTENER.ORA file
has not been enabled and the password entry
does not contain an encrypted value.

¢ The default Administrator account on the Active
Directory server controlling access to the HNGX
estate (ACD) has not been disabled.

Inadequate system security settings increase the risk
of unauthorised access to financial data.

e Setting an encrypted password for the
LISTENER.ORA file on all Oracle
databases supporting the in-scope
applications

e Disabling the default Administrator
account and create’a new
Administrator account with a strong

Management should alsoconsider
implementing monitoring controls to help
ensure robust security settings are in
place, particularly those operated by third
