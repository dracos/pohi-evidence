FUNCTIONAL SPECIFICATION

AUDITOR’S EYE VIEW

SCOPE

This functional specification defines the operational and commercial audit trails.
These are, respectively, the audit trail associated with the operation of the services
which make up the Pathway solution and the audit trail associated with that part of
Pathway’s internal commercial records to which POCL’s Internal Auditors or
Agents as set out in Schedule A03 may have access.

The operational audit trail includes that generated by the mainstream operational
services and the Reconciliation Exceptions Database (RED).

The mainstream operational services are the services making up the POCL Steady
State Services :

« Automated Payment Service (APS)
« EPOS Service (EPOSS)

¢ Order Book Control Service (OBCS)
¢ POCL Infrastructure Services

The RED provides an auxiliary audit trail which separately covers the treatment of
exceptions encountered within the mainstream operational services. The audit trail
associated with the mainstream services is never modified for the purposes of
correction as such.

This specification also addresses in Section 3 certain requirements, particularly
R697, which relate to access by POCL’s commercial auditors to parts of Pathway’s
own internal records and systems. These latter requirements are met through the
definition and use of a commercial audit trial and associated audit procedure
providing for access from within Pathway.

The operational audit trail is retained for 18 months. The commercial audit trail is
retained for seven years although some records are held for the life of the contract,
which may be longer than seven years.

If the technology used to hold elements of the audit trail becomes obsolete then they
will be copied to the new technology to maintain continuity of access.

1.1.2 THE TOTAL MAINSTREAM PATHWAY SOLUTION

From the standpoint of the auditor, the total mainstream solution, including both the
Pathway sub-systems and the source and sink subsystems, is shown in Figure A. The
arrows represent the subsystem interfaces at which key auditable events occur.
Pathway’s responsibilities extend to the subsystems coloured green (darker) and the
interfaces coloured blue (darker).

In addition, but not shown, are the Systems Management facilities that Pathway
employs in the course of operating the hardware and software and
telecommunications platforms themselves.

1.1.3 THE STRATEGIC INFRASTRUCTURE SERVICE

The Strategic Infrastructure Service (SIS) can be analysed as a number of “visible”
counter applications to which the post office clerks interface:

1.1.5.1 POCL IN-HOUSE SYSTEMS

The POCL in-house systems which interface to the Pathway SIS are:
¢ Reference Data
e Transaction Information Processing (TIP)
e SAP Advanced Distribution System (ADS) for inventory management (IM)
« Farnborough Host for AP

The TIP system is batch-oriented, receiving large-scale files of the outlets’
transactions. These comprise daily transactions, weekly (normally) stock holdings
and a cash account, daily AP Client summaries and daily BA transaction
reconciliation reports.

The stock and cash account files are also produced within each office on paper.
These signed paper records will, foreseeably, represent the fiduciary record of the
outlet’s business.

The Reference Data system is responsible for supplying transaction steering data to
Pathway. This data describes the relationships and properties of the data to be
processed (typing of regions, POCL organisations, outlets, Clients, items for sale,
methods of payment, and transaction tokens); and the processing methods

(processing and validation rules, check digits, calendars, accounting collation

ADS is an on-line system but with a same-day level of response time. It handles
orders, secure stock returns, transfers and secure stock inventories, providing for
central control interfacing with Pathway’s Logistics Feeder Service (LFS)

[DN: ADS/LFS is not implemented at Core System Release.]

Initially traffic associated with POCL’s Automated Payment Clients is consolidated
to a single interface with an in-house POCL system, the Farnborough AP Host. Later
these Clients will have direct interfaces to the Pathway SIS for receiving files of
payment records.

POCL CLIENT SYSTEMS

This level of specification does not define the audit facilities to be made available to
the audit departments of POCL’s Automated Payment commercial Clients. These
facilities will be negotiated between POCL and the Client as part of the AP
Migration Plan Interface specification for each Client. Pathway expects that these
Clients will use the same methods as are used for the Farnborough host. It has been
decided by POCL that such Client systems will NOT access the Pathway SIS directly
to provide customer and payment scheme reference data (transaction steering data).
Such data will be passed through the POCL Reference Data system.

AUDIT TRAIL RESPONSIBILITIES AND USAGE

RESPONSIBILITIES

TRACKS AND TRAILS

In the description below use is made of the terms audit track and audit trail. An
audit track is a record of activities made within a Pathway subsystem for one or more
of its interfaces. An audit trail is one or more such tracks. The data recorded in a
trail’s several tracks may represent the treatment of related transfers and processing.

In general it is possible to produce an audit track for an interface on either side of
that interface, or, if the interface is itself problematic, on both sides.

It is of course a matter for POCL and POCL Clients to produce their own audit
tracks on their sides of the interfaces to Pathway.

TWO TRACKS

The Pathway audit trail is based upon files representing the single main audit track
representing the traffic running through the Pathway solution, the POCL SIS. This

system is Pathway’s operational responsibility and its operating interfaces are also
under Pathway control

As discussed above, a second audit track represents the systems management
operation of the Pathway system itself.

PRINCIPALS, AGENTS AND RIGHTS OF ACCESS

A particular audit may be carried out by an Agent for POCL or by POCL themselves.
The Agents that are permitted are defined in Schedule A03.

Pathway provides for rights of access for individual roles and enforces these rights of
access. Changes to these rights is via Change Control.

ACCESS CONTROLS

Access controls are effected through the use of roles.

There are THREE auditor roles: POCL Emergency Manager/auditor, POCL auditor
and POCL Client <C> auditor. It may not be necessary to represent the POCL
Emergency Manager/auditor and POCL auditor separately.

The POCL auditor roles are further defined in the HSAM.

The POCL Emergency Manager/auditor has the same access rights as that of the
Manager or Postmaster. In addition, he may delete and create a Manager/Postmaster
Role, and produce a cash account. Access as POCL Emergency Manager/auditor is
via initial access as POCL auditor then, if required, as in the case of the Manager or
Postmaster being unavailable, a further exchange via the Horizon Help Desk to
obtain a one-shot password which enables the additional Emergency Manager/auditor
operations and a key reference which turns on the filestore encryption/decryption.

POCL Emergency Manager/auditor and POCL auditor have access to all TMS
journal records.

The POCL auditor has no rights to modify the TMS journal. The POCL Emergency
Manager/auditor is not able to modify the TMS journal, except as the auditable result
of permitted operations in connection with his role as an Emergency Manager. In
common with all journal updates, such permitted modifications are always in the
form of appends.

The POCL Client <C> auditor role when implemented will have access only to that
part of the TMS journal which deals with transactions pertaining to that Client and in
accordance with the Client organisation’s contract with POCL. The POCL Client
<C> auditors have no rights to modify the TMS journal.

The POCL Emergency Manager/auditor has access only at the outlet. The POCL
auditor has access at both the outlet and the centre. All access at the centre is via the
Pathway audit function.

1.2.8 AUDIT TRAIL FORMATS

1.2.8.1 NATIVE FORMATS
The principle followed is that Pathway originates the audit track source data in self-
describing flat files.
The format in which the TMS journal is written by Pathway operational sofiware is
that used as input to the utilities which prepare the bulk extracts for the audit
authorities. That is, the Pathway native flat format is the operational format. This
format is attribute grammar (keyword and value) format and is therefore self-
describing at the field level. Subsets of the TMS journal represent the data
transferred to TIP, Farnborough AP, ADS and POCL Clients, and from RD, ADS,
possibly POCL Clients.
The native format of the flat files containing the data transferred between subsystems
is described in file headers. They are therefore self-describing at the file level. See
Host Application Database Design and Interface Standards.
The logs of file transfers (control files) are in one simple format

1.2.8.2 CUSTOM FORMATS
The TMS journal native flat format is not to be further transformed.
Custom formats for other audit files may be specified at a later level of specification.
Transfer is either downloaded from disk or by CDROM.
As a principle, the less transformation the better, since this preserves more of the
original raw data and removes the need to qualify and maintain transforming
software.

1.2.9

AUDIT TRAIL RETENTION PERIODS

R699 states : “Subject to Clause 801 of the Related Agreements, audit trail records
shall be retained for a period consistent with Companies Act requirements, or for a
period of eighteen (18) months, whichever is longer.” The records described in this
document are not subject to the provisions of the Companies Act. Clause 801 refers
to Records which correspond to the commercial audit trail. A general retention
period of 18 months is required for the operational audit trail. See also R816 and
R914,

R829, which deals with Prosecution Support, requires Audit Trail and other
information may be retained for potentially longer periods.

Of course, certain archived data such as EPOSS administration functions, which
contain dated internal references, will itself have an implied longevity of more than
18 months.

POCL SIS TRACK CONTENT AND MAINTENANCE

The POCL SIS audit track comprises:
e the TMS journal
and those POCL files exchanged between the Pathway data centres:
¢ the POCL Horizon Help Desk files
¢ POCL’s own systems’ files
e AP Client files

Any other intermediate file or table constructs do not form part of the track.

TMS JOURNAL

The audit archive of the TMS journal is taken daily at the correspondence server
level by copying all new messages that day to Digital Linear Tape (DLT) audit
archive media.!

The TMS journal comprises records appended to the journal of each outlet within a
messaging group usually in time sequence. Each group includes correspondence
servers which hold a replica of the outlet. The outlet replica(s) of the journal are
housekept from the front periodically to maintain a recent history to cover at least
three cash account periods. The correspondence servers’ replicas are similarly
housekept.

The TMS journal contains the original transaction details, including its origin, when
it happened, who caused it to happen, and the outcome.

HORIZON HELP DESK

The POCL Horizon Help Desk files contain the call records from the Automated Call
Distribution (ACD) system. These are written during operation and harvested daily
into a flat file. A control file will be written for each such daily file.

POCL SYSTEMS

These comprise:

© those at the TIP, RD, Farnborough AP and ADS interfaces holding control records
describing files being transferred

* There is no systematic value in holding separate audit copies of the raw data
transferred across these interfaces with TMS because this is what the TMS

' This represents an improved implementation. By this method the audit trail is always up to
date and in one place.

journal itself represents and because the TIP, Farnborough AP and ADS transfers.
are selective extracts of it

References to ADS/LFS are not definitive at this level of specification.
2.1.1.4 AP CLIENT SYSTEMS

These are to be defined at later levels of specification. The expectation is that these
will correspond to those for POCL Systems.

2.1.1.5 POCL <DSS> CLIENT
The specific DSS element of the POCL Audit Track comprises the following files
outside the Pathway boundary :
¢ that at OAS with ESNCS
and within the boundary :
e that at OBCS
© with TMS
Any other intermediate file and table constructs do not form part of the track.
OBCS
This comprises:

e the Control Notice updates table for access by the OBCS TMS Loader Agent,
and:

¢ OBCS transactions, comprising encashment transactions and totals table received
from the OBCS TMS Harvester Agent

The data used to represent these are the serial files transferred to and from OAS.

An audit control file provides as a permanent record of all files received and
transferred by OAS.

This file is kept permanently on-line within OAS(VME). It is also transferred in its
entirety to the ICL Pathway Sequent as part of the daily housekeeping process.

2.1.2 AUDIT ACCESS TO THE POCL SIS TRACK
Logical audit access will be provided as follows:
2.1.2.1 TMS JOURNAL ACCESS AT THE OUTLET
Views of the transactions which have taken place within a whole post office during

the recent past are available from any counter or back office position within a post
office, subject to the auditor himself having appropriate access rights. This recent

past period for which transaction records will remain at any workstation in the post
office varies inversely with the traffic conducted by that office as a whole, but is not
less than the current and two previous cash account periods, such periods being
typically a week. The term “transactions” here embraces both the serving of
customers and EPOSS administration events. The journal is also used to carry
certain Pathway control sequences. These are of no intrinsic interest to auditors but
their retention within the message numbering means that auditors can be sure there
are no missing records”.

2.1.2.2 TMS JOURNAL ACCESS AT THE CORRESPONDENCE SERVERS

Equivalent TMS journal data is maintained at each of the two Pathway central
services sites. These are not copies one of the other but are independently derived
from the same original data by the same systems. They will therefore provide a
natural point of systematic reconciliation: for example, on a sample basis it is
possible to compare the audit track record of the same transaction recorded in two
places to verify that systems were operating consistently.

Audit records are written to DLT audit archive media. They are presented in exactly
the same way as recent records when retrieved although will be subject to filters
appropriate to the selection and the audit authority for which the selection is being
made. Archive records will take a longer time to retrieve, typically up to 30 minutes.

If and when the TMS service provider changes, then the TMS journal will be
transferred to the new provider as part of the transfer agreement. Apart from the
longevity of data retention and the associations of data with post offices, these views
are equivalent to those taken in the post office. It is understood that the vast majority
of POCL audits will be conducted within the post offices, with resort to the
Correspondence Server views only where the outlet views are not available (denial,
destruction) or, of course, where the historical record is required.

Access from one outlet to the data of another or to the back-history data on the
correspondence servers is not provided.

Although the bulk of the TMS journal data is transferred to TIP, R699 specifies that
the audit trail shall be maintained and retained by Pathway and protected by security
measures.

2.1.2.3 HORIZON HELP DESK LOG FILE ACCESS

This comprises simple access to serial flat file. File selection will be by date or
dates. Search of the selected file will be by ordinary text search.

2.1.2.6.1.1 ACCESS USING KEYS
In both the post office and correspondence server cases audit facilities are provided
to retrieve, store locally, display and/or print one or more transaction records, with
the selection being based on simple keys. Key elements may be drawn from certain
selected keys in the transaction records.
These key elements will be:
¢ one or more outlets as defined by reference data, e.g. POCL Region
¢ stock unit
¢ clerk id
¢ interval of time
¢ POCL Client identity
© one or more product codes
Other specific key elements may be defined at a later level of specification in the
light of experience.
The keys which an auditor may use will be in accordance with the auditor role.
Controls will be available to limit the selection to practical length. Initially this
control will be set at 256 records.
Disk serial files thus produced may be saved for later local search.

no auditor-specific actions required. In all meaningful cases print or print-preview is

provided.

Where access to the outlet itself is not possible, as for example when an outlet has
been destroyed by fire, equivalent access might be effected by visit to a
correspondence server centre or by restarting the outlet at an auditor centre or a
replacement centre.

2.1.2.6.2 Bulk access using keys

Bulk access is provided in the correspondence server centres only. A utility is
provided to produce bulk selections according to the role of the auditor and in the
custom magnetic format specified by the audit authority to which he belongs. POCL
Client audit authorities may require different formats from those used by POCL but
Pathway proposes that they be required to use the Pathway native flat format directly.
Clearly, subject to the terms of POCL’s contract with a POCL Client, the data
accessed will be limited to that pertaining to that Client.

The bulk selection utilises the same keyed access methods as for interactive access.
Additional key fields to represent one or more post offices will be available. The
selections are, in principle, of unlimited length. Long selections, where the audit
function expects greater than I million records from direct access or 100,000 records
from archive media, or numbers of selections which would disrupt operational
schedules are ordered or scheduled by mutual agreement. Selections confined to the
data which is on direct access may be undertaken in emergencies.

Such bulk files are delivered to one location using media and transport methods to be
agreed. Bulk selections except the very largest may be file-transferred over the same
communications as are used for TIP and eventually Client AP. It is essential that the
security of any such path used be no less than that of these paths. Very large
selections are transferred only in CDROM form and are either collected from
Pathway or couriered by Post Office Special Delivery to one location.

Regular use of bulk selections allows audit functions to build up a history for own
use.

In the event that the audit function requires direct, personal and extempore access to
the actual TMS operational journal then this access will be by attendance at a
Pathway centre and will be supervised by Pathway.

2.2 SYSTEMS MANAGEMENT TRACK
2.2.1 SYSTEMS MANAGEMENT TRACK CONTENT AND MAINTENANCE

The track is made up of audit events for the particular domain in question. In the
Pathway solution all events are generated within domains and eventually transferred
to the Tivoli Event Management Server.

Within these domains events are collected by Tivoli Agents and transformed into
Tivoli Events. On non-NT platforms the Tivoli Agent role is performed by an
equivalent agent function within the local systems management facility appropriate to
the platform.

These non-NT platforms are:

e the Sequent Servers, whose events are relayed by BMC Patrol

e SUN Servers, whose events are notified directly

¢ Network Devices, such as routers, whose events are mediated by HP OpenView
Audit events comprise:

e System Events, which include Security Events

e Status Reports

¢ Software Distributions

System Events are gathered from all domains, and Status Reports and Software
Distributions from all Windows NT domains.

Tivoli provides extensive event management facilities including central display,
sorting and filtering before viewing, for example, all operations initiated by a
particular operator. These facilities are accessed via a PC-based Tivoli Desktop
available to the Pathway Systems Management functions located in Stevenage and
Lytham St Annes and connected via the Pathway WAN to the master Tivoli
Management Region, or hierarchic level which is at Bootle.

These Tivoli Events are extracted from the Tivoli Event Management Server and
archived using the standard Archive Service. Filters are used to remove unusable
operational events before archiving. Archiving is in Comma Separated Variable
(CSV) format.

3. THE COMMERCIAL AUDIT TRAIL

The commercial audit trail is defined to comprise material, held in either magnetic
forms or definitively on paper, to which the Authorities have access.

3.1 MAGNETIC RECORDS

These comprise copies of certain Operational Support records that the Authorities
receive as part of the Steady State and other Services, and those parts of ICL
Pathway’s internal commercial records to which the Authorities have automated
access.

The tracks making up the magnetic commercial audit trail are:
¢ Reconciliation Exceptions Database (RED)

e Service Level Contract Administration (SLCA)
3.1.1 RED

RED is free-standing from the mainstream Pathway Solution. It is a record of the
activities undertaken by the Pathway Customer Service Business Support Unit to
make necessary adjustments to transactions, typically to effect accurate
reconciliations. It is implemented as a Microsoft Access database. Usage is by
import to Microsoft Access.

3.1.1.2 DATA RETENTION REQUIRE

number of measures established in the contract Schedule BO3. It does this by taking
information feeds from the Data Warehouse (DW) and running these against special
formulae, again established in the contract. SLAM is used to report the outcome of

these calculations to the Horizon Service Management Group, a Pathway/POCL
committee.

¢ Manual Transaction Data (Achievement of Rollout, achievement of Training
etc).

¢ Standing Data - SLA parameters and formulae used to calculate achievement are
held as Oracle tables within the DW

3.1.2.3 CHANGES TO STANDING DATA

Changes to the SLA Parameters and mathematical formulae are allowed via an
Administration Facility within the SLCA system. Physical access to this facility is
strictly controlled and password controls are used to control logical access.

Changes to the parameters and/or formulae require pre-authorisation through the
Change Control process before they can be applied. A CCN number must exist for
each change.

Records of changes to Standing Data, including Contract, Contract SLA,
Performance Measure and Liquidated Damages are maintained:

¢ For each field in the Contract table created, amended or deleted a record of the
change

¢ For each field in the Contract SLA table created, amended or deleted a record of
the change

e For each field in the Performance Measures table created, amended or deleted a
record of the change

¢ For each field in the Liquidated Damages table created, amended or deleted a
record of the change

3.1.2.4 OUTPUT STREAMS

e Data output from the various calculations are passed to Service Level Agreement
Monitor (SLAM) where they are converted into graphs and histograms for
presentation to interested groups among them the POCL/Pathway Service
Management Group. SLAM is a passive system insofar that it does not carry out
any processing other than to transform tables of numbers into graphical
representations.

¢ Remedy Calculations are generated by SLCA for subsequent application during
the quarterly invoicing cycle within the Common Charging System. These values
are held as Oracle tables within the DW.

INVOICING

System Overview

Although the generation of an Invoice is a manual activity, and the core Invoice
values and frequencies are determined by the Contract between POCL and ICL
Pathway, there are a number of variable elements that are applied to each Invoice :

e Transaction volumes where the actual transaction count is compared to a
benchmark value and an adjustment factor calculated.

¢ Outlet availability during the Invoice period.

¢ Numbers of outlets actually rolled-out during NRO compared to original target.
e Liquidated damages arising from failures to achieve SLA commitments.

The Contract also allows for RPI adjustments.

Interim, or ad-hoc, invoices can be generated at any time although these do not
become committed and are used for internal reporting purposes only.

Instruction to be raised but it is included for completeness.)

Changes to Contractual Data

Changes to any element of the Contractual data can only be achieved through formal
negotiation between the two parties.

Qutput Stream

The invoicing suite of documents consists of the following :

a. Capital Payment Invoice

b. Operating Fee Invoice

c. Advice Note for OFT.

d. Credit Note for service credits.

e. General Invoice for ad-hoc supply of goods and services.
f. RPI Adjustment Tracking Schedule.

Data Retention Requirements

3.2.1.2 CHANGE CONTROL DOCUMENTATION

Change Control is an agreed process through which changes to the Horizon are
defined, notified, impacted and costed, authorised and controlled.

Documents that are output from the process and which represent the audit trail of
proposed changes and their outcome are:

e Change Request: used by sponsors to request changes of Pathway.

e Change Proposals: used by Pathway to progress the change through the Change
Control process.
