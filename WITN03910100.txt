POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY

FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF JACQUELINE JONES

I, Jacqueline Jones, will say as follows:

INTRODUCTION
1. This witness statement has been made by myself to assist the Post
Office IT inquiry with the matters set out in the Rule 9 Request
provided to me on the 1% of November which assumes that I have

direct knowledge of such matters.

2. Set out in this statement is my best recollection of the matters raised
in the inquiry’s request in which I was directly involved. However,
some of these topics relate to matters which took place between 10 to
22 years ago, therefore there are circumstances where my recollection

is limited.

I am currently not working for Post Office Ltd. I left the business in
2019 after working there for 33 years in a variety of roles. I joined the
Post Office in 1986 in the Data Processing Unit keying paper cash
accounts and dockets as a clerical officer. In 1987 I moved to Royal
Mail’s IT Department working as a Postal Officer (PO) tester of a
mainframe solution. I was subsequently transferred to Post Office
Ltd.’s Business Systems Department to work as a project support
Officer (PO). Other PO roles I had whilst in Business Systems include
working as an Analyst on the IT helpdesk and another role as a tester
on a project. I then moved into Transaction Processing as a PO on
the Automated Payments Team working on error resolution. I also
worked as a temporary Team Leader for the South East Regional
Team (CM2 Junior Manager role), Horizon Live Trial Manager and
Systems Support Manager both at CM2. I then moved back to the IT
Department within Post Office Ltd as a Testing Manager (CM1 Middle
Manager). I then moved to the Horizon Online Programme as a
Business Analyst (CM1). I then moved to the Network Transformation
Programme as a Business Analyst and to my last role in the Post

Office as Budget and People Manager (SB9 Senior Manager).

I have been asked to explain what qualifications that I have or relevant
experience. My qualifications that are relevant to my roles includes
Level 5 Certificate in Coaching and Mentoring 2017, Prince2

Registered Practitioner 2013, ISEB Diploma in Business Systems

Page 2 of 17
WITNO03910100
WITNO3910100

Development 2006, ISED Certificate Requirements Engineering 2006,
ISEB Certificate Business Organisation 2006, ISEB Certificate in
Business Analysis Essentials 2005, Foundation Certificate in Software
Testing 2004. As well as the qualifications and courses I also gained
experience as a tester over many years working for the Post Office in
a number of roles on mainframe solutions including accounting
solutions and Automated Payments data. I tested many small
systems as a Postal Officer and as a CM2 junior manager, the details

of which I cannot recall due to the time elapsed.

. I have been asked to describe any training that I received on or for
these roles. I attended many in-house training courses provided by
Post Office Ltd, however I can only list those that I can remember due
to the time elapsed. I can remember attending: - Having Difficult
Conversations, Interview Techniques, Customer First, DOORS
requirements system, five day management development course.
There would have been others that I cannot recall due to the time
elapsed. I received one on one training for most of the new roles that I
undertook during my time at the Post Office, the duration of which I
cannot remember. I also shadowed colleagues and I spent time in
other departments when I joined Transaction Processing so that I

would understand the end-to-end cash account process.

6. I have been given a copy of the Impact Programme’s Horizon to MI
(S70) Application Interface Specification document (POL00038888)
and I am listed in this document as a reviewer. I worked on many
releases and this document would have been one of many documents

that I reviewed in my role on the Test Team.

7. Ithas been mentioned in your first Rule 9 request question that I was
a HNG Implementation Manager for the HNG-X Programme in 2010.
When I joined the HNG Programme it was as a Business Analyst not
an Implementation Manager. After working on the requirements (use
cases) strand I subsequently moved onto a Project Lead role to deliver
Online Help which replaced paper operations manuals and converted
them into .HTML pages to view on Horizon. I subsequently worked as
the Project Lead to deliver ISDN to ADSL telephone lines project. At
the end of these projects, I briefly worked on the Implementation Team
for a period of a few months before moving onto another Project,
again in a Business Analyst role. I cannot recall the activities or role
that I was involved in on the Implementation Team as it was a very

short period and so long ago.

IMPACT Programme

8. I have been asked to explain the purpose of the IMPACT Programme and why

I believe the programme came about. I do not know how the Programme

Page 4 of 17
10.

11.

WITNO03910100
WITNO3910100

came about and this would not be something that I as a junior manager would
have been involved in. I cannot recall the purpose other than to state that I
assume it was to improve the Horizon system. It is approximately 18 years
ago and this programme was one of many that I would have worked on for

Post Office Ltd and I do not recall this level of detail.

I have been asked to explain the process involved in developing the IMPACT
Programme. I was not involved in the development of the IMPACT
programme and I cannot recollect who was involved except that this would sit
at a senior leadership level e.g., Programme Manager, Design Authority Lead,

Head of IT and Post Office Board.

I have been asked to explain my role as part of the Post Office Ltd Test Team
and to describe any tests that were carried out with regards to the Impact
Programme. During my time on the Test Team I worked on a number of test
releases, however, due to the time elapsed some 18 years, I cannot recall
specific details around the actual testing for the Impact Programme or any

specific tests that would have been carried out.

I can explain at a high level what my role encompassed on the Test team. I
was the Test Lead for the back end for Transaction Processing and Reference
Data teams for each new testing release. My role was defined within the

Testing Teams overarching Testing Strategy. This strategy laid out the team

Page 5 of 17
WITN03910100
WITNO3910100

roles and responsibilities, the scope of testing, teams involved, fault resolution
processes, testing methods, equipment, systems, test data and other
information I cannot recall. My role also included writing test scripts in
conjunction with Transaction Processing and Reference Data teams and
obtaining their and wider sign-off prior to testing. The test scripts would be
used for user acceptance and regression testing (not system testing as this is
normally a Supplier function). Test scripts would be based on the changes
defined in the Programme's requirements catalogue, design documents and
interface specifications for each new test release for back end systems. The
outcome of all the tests would be to feed evidence back to the Requirements
catalogue to prove whether or not testing had been successful. For the
Impact Programme this may have included some of the documents supplied
to me by the inquiry including:- Impact Programme Horizon to MI (S70)
Application Interface Specification (POLO00038888) of which I am a named
reviewer, Impact Programme POLFS to NS&I Application Interface
Specification (POL00038925) of which I am a named reviewer, Accounting &
Cash Management Programme Conceptual Design (POL00038870), I am not
down as a reviewer, I may have seen this document but cannot recall. I note
that it does not contain the requirements catalogue which would also be used
to produce the test scripts. Impact Release 3 Counter Design for Balancing,
Rollover and Stock Processing (FUJ000851 24), I am not down as a reviewer,
however I may have seen this document but cannot recall due to the time

elapsed. Impact Release 3 Design Proposal (FUJ00090393), I am not down

Page 6 of 17
WITNO03910100
WITNO3910100

as a reviewer, however I may have seen this document but cannot recall due

to the time elapsed some 18 years.

12.My role also included logging any defects identified by the back-end teams
involved in user acceptance and regression testing in line with the Testing
Team fault resolution process which was managed by the Testing Team
Leader. My role would include arranging for any agreed defect fixes to be re-
tested in the subsequent phases of the testing cycle by back-end teams and

to obtain sign-off by them at the end of the test release.

13.1 have been asked to comment on whether or not I feel that the IMPACT
Programme was successful. I was not involved in the production of the
business case, design, or setup of this Programme as I was a junior manager.
This would have been done by the Programme Manager, Head of Design and
the Senior Leadership team at the time. I cannot recall seeing any of the Post
Implementation Review documentation for this Programme which was some
18 years ago. This would be one of the factors used by Post Office Ltd to

determine whether or not the Programme was successful.

14.1 have been asked to comment on the suggestion that the IMPACT

Programme led to sub postmasters unfairly being held responsible for

disputed sums of money. I cannot recall any system issues at the end of

Page 7 of 17
WITN03910100
WITNO3910100

Testing for the Impact Programme and I have no knowledge of any disputed

sums of money so am unable to offer an opinion.

Horizon Online

15.I have been asked to explain the reasons behind the migration to HNGx and
to consider the document Network Development Training Development Plan
(POL33738). I cannot recall the reasons behind the migration to HNGx due to
the time elapsed some 10 years ago. I was not involved in the Business case
for HNGx, its approval, or the Programme setup activities. However, the
reasons are described in the document supplied to me by the inquiry Horizon
Next Generation Release 1 End Programme Report (POL00033200). I
cannot recall document POL00033738, this document appears to be an
internal Team document and has me listed as the lead for “Tools for the job
(Technology)”, my name appears not to have been removed from this activity
despite it stating that I was diverted to another activity (Column 5). To my
knowledge I had no further involvement in training for branches and due to the
time elapsed I cannot recall any other details around training. When I joined
the HNGx Programme it was as a Business Analyst. I subsequently moved
onto a Project Lead role to deliver Online Help and another project delivering
ISDN to ADSL telephone lines. The second project was totally separate to the
HNGx Programme system changes and involved working with BT and Post

Office Property Teams.

WITNO03910100
WITNO3910100

16.1 have been asked to explain as far as I am aware the design and
development of HNG-X. I can recall that HNG-X aimed to deliver a refreshed
front end screen for sub-postmasters more in line with industry standards,
however, due to the time elapsed I cannot recall any further detail or

information relating to the design or development of HNG-X.

17.1 have been asked to explain how roles and responsibilities were allocated
between the Post Office and Fujitsu. I have no knowledge of how this was
done as this would be completed by the senior leadership team including
Programme Manager, Design Authority, Head of IT and Post Office Board

with no involvement on my part.

18.1 have been asked to explain what training sub postmasters were given in
support of the transition to Horizon Online. I was not involved in the training
for branches strand activities within this Programme and it was managed by
the Central Programme Team. Due to the time elapsed I cannot recall any

other details around training.

19.1 have been asked to comment on whether adjustments were made to the
training in light of any difficulties that ensued. I was not involved in the
training strand of the Programme and due to the time elapsed I cannot

remember if there were any difficulties.

Page 9 of 17
WITNO03910100
WITNO3910100

20.1 have been asked to explain if I have seen the document Horizon Next
Generation Release 1 End Programme Report (POL00033200). This
document may or may not have been shared with me for information after it
was completed, however, due to the time elapsed I cannot confirm. I am
mentioned in Section 12.1 ISDN telephone lines to ADSL connections in Post
Office branches. This was a separate project that I was leading to deliver new
telephone connections into branches and was totally separate to the HNGx
Programme and involved working with BT and Post Office Property Teams. I
would have been asked to update the Programme Manager on the status of

the project I was leading for input to his report.

21.1 have been asked to comment on the adjustments or releases that had to be
made to HNG-x in order to rectify any issues. Due to the time elapsed some
10 years or more, I cannot recall any adjustments or releases made to HNG-X

and I cannot recall being involved in these activities.

The High Volume Roll Out
22. I have been asked to explain the reasons why the high volume pilot of
Horizon Online was suspended. Due to the time elapsed some 10 years or
more, I cannot recall the reasons why this was suspended. The Programme
Manager would have made this decision in conjunction with his Lead Team,
Senior Post Office managers, Head of IT, Design Authority and Post Office

Board.

WITNO03910100
WITNO3910100

23. I have been asked to explain how I feel this could have been avoided. Due to
the time elapsed I cannot recall the pilot being suspended or the reasons why
this was suspended and I therefore cannot venture an opinion. The
Programme Manager would have made this decision along with his Lead
Team, Senior Post Office managers, Head of IT, Design Authority and Post
Office Board including why a high-volume pilot was necessary in the first

place.

Bugs and Errors

24.1 have been asked to consider PEAK Incident Management System document
(POL00000760) and comment on what I thought of the appearance of
incomplete/missing transactions that I was notified of. Due to the time
elapsed some 22 years, I cannot recall this specific incident or the details of
any other incidents. This would have been one of many incidents that I dealt
with and it would have been actioned and managed in line with the Horizon
Live Trial Incident and Problem Management process. I have read
POL00000760, which is the Fujitsu Helpdesk level 1 service. I am mentioned
on page 4, 17 Aug 2000 at 12:52 where it states that I was provided with a
BIM report 0007111299 (which has not been provided to me) and
subsequently confirmed with the Postmaster that there were no missing AP
transactions. It also states that all transaction data has been provided to me
by Fujitsu in a spreadsheet presumably for investigative purposes. On 17 Aug

2000 at 14:48, there is a subsequent update from John Moran which states

Page 11 of 17
WITN03910100
WITNO3910100

that the incident had been discussed with myself, it states that all transactions

have been reported to POCL.

25.1 have been asked to explain what steps I took as part of the Live Trial Team
to investigate the problem (refer to point 24.) or rectify it. Due to the time
elapsed some 22 years, I cannot recall this specific incident or in fact any
others and it would have been one of many that I was involved with. I
therefore cannot explain the actual steps taken for this particular branch to
investigate and rectify this particular issue. This issue would have been
actioned and managed in line with the Horizon Live Trial Incident and Problem
Management process outlined below in point 26. to the best of my

recollection.

26.1 have some recollections of the role in general terms which was as the CM2
Live Trial Incident Manager for Transaction Processing (TP). This junior
manager role would have been to ensure that live trial incidents for TP were
logged, tracked, investigated, resolved and reported on to the Project Team.
This role reported into the Problem Manager on the Live Trial project Team.
My role and responsibilities would have been defined in the Live Trial Incident
and Problem Management Procedures document. POL00000760 mentions
that I was sent a BIM0007111299 report. This was a Fujitsu document
reporting an incident and then used by them to explain an incident and its
effects on a branch. Investigations would have been completed by myself and

Page 12 of 17
WITNO03910100
WITNO3910100

others under the direction of the Problem Manager, the methods of which
would depend on each incident raised. Incidents raised as a “problem” would
be managed and progressed wholly by the Problem Manager. Investigative
methods may have included looking at the branches “received” transactions
for the day with the relevant Teams in Transaction Processing, talking to
Fujitsu teams and requesting additional evidence/data from them, talking to
the branch and requesting/reviewing any relevant branch
documentation/receipts, analysing end of day branch message store data,
getting paper cash accounts out of storage, analysing cash account outcomes

and whatever else was necessary to fully investigate an incident.

27.A detailed Team incident log would have been kept for every incident. These
would have been reviewed and agreed with the Problem Manager and would
have included the conclusion and outcomes. This has not been provided to
me. Any remedial activity required would have been implemented in
conjunction with TP Teams, these could have included the issuing of an error
notice to a branch or asking the Regional Network Manager to write off an
amount. The branch would have been informed of the details and the
outcome either by telephone and/or in writing. The incident logs would have
been monitored daily/weekly and reported to my Manager (the Live Trial
Problem Manager) and through her into the wider Horizon Live Trial project
leadership Team. I cannot recall any further detail around the investigative

processes or steps as it was 22 years ago.

28.1 have been asked to set out my recollection of a number of bugs, errors or
defects as defined by Fraser J in Appendices 1 and 2 of Bates & Others v
Post Office Limited [2019] EWHC 3408(QB).; the receipts and payments
mismatch bug; the suspense account bug; the Dalmellington bug/branch
outreach issue; the remming in bug; the local suspense account issue;
recovery issues; withdrawn stock discrepancies’ Bureau discrepancies; Post &
Go / TA discrepancies in POLSAP; bureau de change; and Lyca top-up. I
have been asked to state what Fujitsu told Post Office and / or myself about
the bug, error, or defect and when. Due to the time elapsed, some 22 years, I
am unable to comment as I have no recollection of any of these specific bugs,
errors or defects from the descriptions and I do not recall my involvement /

role if any.

29. I have been asked to state whether or not I was aware of any other issues
that arose. I am unable to comment as I have no recollection of any specific

issues that arose due to the time elapsed some 22 years.

Reflections

30.1 have been asked to state what if anything I would have done differently with
the benefit of hindsight. I cannot think that I could have done anything
differently in the roles that I had. I followed all the prescribed processes to the

letter and took pride in doing a good job.

Page 14 of 17
WITN03910100
WITNO3910100

31. I have been asked to say who I think is responsible for the Post Office
scandal. I wasn’t aware that there was a problem with Horizon until just
before I left the business. I was told by the Horizon Live Trial Project Team
that Fujitsu could not alter the back end of the system and I always believed
this. I have not seen all the evidence required and I therefore do not feel that I

would be informed enough to have an opinion.

32.1 have been asked what I think the Post Office could have done differently
during my time there. As a junior and middle manager it would be difficult for
me to know if something was inherently wrong with Horizon and the Post
Office. I have not seen all of the required evidence and I therefore do not feel

that I would be informed enough to have an opinion.

Statement of Truth

I believe the content of this statement to be true.
