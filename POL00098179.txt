Thx - you are right - has to be tomorrow.
That creates a diary problem. But I shall just have to pause my media training. Sorry Mark.
I will need good briefing Alwen. Can you arrange this? I only get one chance.

Thank you.

Paula please see email below before I go back to Janet, I think there are two options. We could have a
call tomorrow but you will not have all the pre mortem work finished for stakeholders we could
however take the time to talk about the high level best outcome we can expect and get his viewpoint as
to the way forward and the conclusion including managing MPs and JFSP. I think this would be very
helpful before he goes away.

Or we can try and get a date in recess which seems a long time away.

What do you think?

Thanks
Alwen

Dear Alwen,
Thanks for your message. Just to let you know the situation from here...

Alan Bates (JSFA) sent James a letter, and James has passed this on to Second
Sight for comment, letting Alan know that this is what has been done. He is now
waiting for Second Sight to respond, and I shall nudge them today.

He is going abroad on Committee business this weekend, and won't be back until
22 May, by which time it is Whitsun Recess (21 May — 2 June). He may come in
to London for a day, but really won’t be back until 3 June.

I wondered whether:
1. This might be done by phone this morning, or tomorrow morning?
Or
2. Can you suggest a date and time as soon as possible during the Recess
period so I can ask James if he might come in to London to see Paula? It
would be good to try to line this up today, if this is the solution.

Tam sorry to harry you, but I know this is important, and would like to help all I
can.

Kind regards
Janet
