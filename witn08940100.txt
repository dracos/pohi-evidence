                                                       Dated: 7 November 2023




                         POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY




                 FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF ROBERT DAILY




I, Robert Daily, will say as follows:



Introduction


1.   This witness statement is made to assist the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry (the

     "Inquiry") with the matters set out in the Rule 9 Request dated 3 October 2023

     (the "Request"). I have received advice and assistance from a lawyer in the

     preparation of this statement.

My professional background


2.   I am an employee of Post Office Ltd ("POL") and hold the position of Security

     Manager. I joined POL on 17 December 1979. I have listed and summarised

     below the roles I have held throughout my career to the present date, and the

     approximate dates that I was in these roles, to the best of my recollection:


     2.1.    Counter clerk (grade Postal Officer), 1979-1984. This role involved


                                        Page 1 of 44
                                                                                 WI TNO8940100
                                                                               WI TN08940100




       serving the general public. I had my own stock unit that I had to balance,

       this was completed on a paper balance sheet. At end of a 12-month

       probation period, I was sent to work in various branches before taking a

       permanent position at George Square Crown Office in Glasgow.


2.2.   Remittance Unit and TV Licence Records, 1984-1987. Working in the

       Remittance Unit, I was placed on what were called "writing duties" and

       worked on the "float", meaning that I was sent to various departments to

       cover holidays and sick leave. I mainly worked in the Coin Centre in Thistle

       Street, Glasgow (part of the Remittance Unit), processing coin from Post

       Office branches and making up coin bags to send to Post Office branches.

       Being on the float during this time meant that I also worked in TV Licence

       Records, attending people's homes to check if they had a TV licence. If

       they didn't, they could pay at the door and a receipt would be given, or I

       would make a report to my Line Manager.


2.3.   Remittance Unit, 1987-1989. During this period working in the

       Remittance Unit, my role involved processing inward and outward

       remittances from branches (this was before systems were computerised)

       and processing business banking from external customers.


2.4.   Cash Management, 1989-1993. In this role I processed the Overnight

       Cash Holding figures sent in from Post Office branches and set daily

       targets for Post Office branches.


2.5.   Distribution, 1993-1997. This role involved monitoring the performance

       of Remittance Units in the Northern Territory (Glasgow, Aberdeen, Dundee

       and Belfast). I visited the units to perform time and motion studies of the


                                 Page 2 of 44

                                                                                 WI TN08940100




       work carried out.


2.6.   Security, 1997 to date. Initially, I worked as a Postal Officer (between

       1997-2004), ordering parts for parcel hatches, contacting contractors to

       attend branches to repair security equipment, project work (e.g. the screen

       2000 upgrade of screens in Post Offices), arranging contractors, and

       liaising with Post Offices to arrange suitable dates for this work to be

       carried out.


2.7.   Since 2005 I have worked as a Security and Investigations Manager,

       performing various roles. (I had applied unsuccessfully for this post in

       about 1999 or 2000, 1 recall). I describe this role in more detail later in my

       statement, but to summarise: in this role I investigate crime or suspected

       crime against POL, collate paperwork, identify suspects, arrange and

       conduct interviews and submit reports to the Casework team for decisions.

       In outline, when a decision is taken not proceed to prosecution, the case

       is closed; if a decision is taken to proceed, I submit a report to the Crown

       Office & Procurator Fiscal Service ("COPFS"). If the COPFS decides to

       proceed with a prosecution, I provide the productions (i.e. exhibits)

       supporting the case to COPFS. Latterly (as I explain elsewhere in this

       statement) BTO (aka Brechin, Tindall, Oates) Solicitors LLP, were

       employed to advise on reports and evidence. I liaised with BTO regarding

       the content of my reports to ensure I had covered all enquiries and there

       was sufficient evidence to either proceed to prosecution or not.


2.8.   My "security" role includes attending branches to conduct security reviews,

       give advice, and check equipment is being used correctly. I also carry out


                                 Page 3 of 44

                                                                                   WI TN08940100




           visits and/or phone calls after an incident at a branch (such as a

           robbery/burglary).


3.   The Request asks me to give an account of my role as a Security/Investigations

     Manager from 2005, including how I became an Investigations Manager, the

     experience I had and the training I received, my understanding of what the role

     involved, who I reported to, and my opinion on the competence and

     professionalism of my colleagues and managers.


4.   I joined the Security & Investigation team as an Investigation Manager in 2005.

     In 2011 my role changed to Security & Investigation Manager and my current role

     is as a currently Security Manager.


5.   I applied for the job of Investigation Manager in 2004. The role was advertised as

     temporary for six months. I was successful in the interview and was appointed.

     When the temporary six-month period came to an end, I was informed my position

     was being made permanent.


6.   I have been asked to consider my CV, the document at POL00105143. This

     contains an account of my skills and experience acquired in the role of

     Investigations Manager from January 2005. My recollection is that the Security &

     Investigations Team, as it was known then, underwent a reorganisation in 2008,

     and I was required to submit my CV.


7.   I have also been asked to consider the document at POL00129121, which

     appears to be a statement I made in support if an application for the role of

     Investigation Manager. Again, I believe this to be from either 2008 or 2014 when

     I had to apply for my role as an Investigation Manager during the organisational

     restructures in those years.

                                                                                     WI TN08940100




8.   All the experience and expertise I have has been acquired through working in my

     role. I have not pursued any formal qualifications for my role. I have also

     undergone training, and set out below an account of the training that I recall being

     given.


9.   I say in my CV at POL00105143 that I had the knowledge and skills required for

     the position of Investigation Manager, and that I had knowledge of the corporate

     investigations policies and standards. I believe that to be an accurate assessment

     of my capabilities at that time, and now.


10. I have been based in Glasgow throughout the time I have had roles in the Security

     Team.


11. I recall that I was temporarily promoted to the role of Investigation Manager in

     2000 and I recall attended some training at that time.


12. I recall that when taking up the role of Investigation Manager, I received 4-5

     weeks training in the training unit above the Lavender Hill Post Office/Battersea

     Delivery Office in London. The training was given by Royal Mail Group accredited

     trainers who had experience of Investigations. The training covered the Police

     and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 ("PACE") Codes of Practice, Theft Act, carrying

     out searches, suspect offender interviews, cognitive witness interviews, taking

     witness statements (including the use of the Solicitor and Friends forms), the

     Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act, IIMARC (which refers to "information,

     intention, method, administration, risk assessment, communications, human

     rights and other legal issues") and NPA notifications ("NPA" refers to "non-Police

     Agency", and the notifications refer to notifications we made to the police about

     the criminal proceedings we undertook). After a few months in my role as an

                                                                                      WI TN08940100




     investigations manager, I went to Rugby to attend further training, including

     courtroom training.


13. I can also recall being given onsite/field training on Scots Law, with the main

     difference at the time being that, in Scotland, a suspect was not offered a solicitor

     to be present at an interview.


14. I have also been asked to consider the performance and development review

     carried out for the 2013/14 at POL00105145. The document is my performance

     review for that year. Each year all managers within POL have to complete a six

     month and annual performance and development review ("PDR"). We have to

     reflect on what we had done and what we considered we had done well in each

     period.


15. When I took up the role of Investigation Manager, I reported to Judith (Jude)

     Trotter, and after she left I reported to Diane Matthews for a temporary period

     and then Andrew Daley. Afterwards, my recollection is that I had a series of

     managers: Lesley Frankland, followed by Keith Gilchrist, then Kevin Ryan and

     Simon Hutchinson (again for a temporary period) and then Helen Dickinson

     before she left in around 2019. I am now managed by Simon Talbot.


16. I have always viewed my colleagues and managers to be competent and

     professional.


17. In outline, I understood the role of Investigation Manager to involve investigating

     crime or suspected crime against POL by its staff, agents and their employees.


18. In my CV at POL00105143 I mentioned the Financial Evaluation form. Following

     an interview with a suspect, I was required to complete a Financial Evaluation


                                      Page 6 of 44
                                                                                       WI TN08940100
                                                                                     WI TN08940100




     Sheet. This detailed the suspect's name, the Post Office branch and what they

     had said about the loss; the form also recorded my opinion on the loss and any

     financial details given by the suspect, including how they intended to repay any

     monies. Although I had to complete the form for Scottish cases, it was recognised

     that POL Financial Investigators did not have the authority to conduct a Financial

     Investigation in Scotland.


19. In my CV at POL00105143 I also mentioned case submission timescales. All

     cases had to be submitted within appropriate timescales. I can't fully recall the

     timescale, but I believe it may have been 12 days from the interview. I also

     mentioned in my CV I was in the process of making up a crib sheet as a reminder

     for the timescales, but I can't recall if I completed this.


20. In my CV at POL00105143 I also mention the Post Office Risk Assessment

     ("PORA") form. I was also required to complete and submit a PORA prior to

     interviews. I would contact the local police to ask if there were any concerns about

     the area to be visited including the area the suspected resided. Warning signs, if

     known, were to be captured along with a risk evaluation. This was then submitted

     to my Line Manager.


21. In my performance review for 2013/14, at POL00105145, I refer (at pages 3 and

     4) to some work I did to secure specialist legal advice for Scottish casework, when

     Scottish cases were submitted to POL Legal Services for review. It was

     recognised within POL Legal Services and the Security Team that they weren't

     knowledgeable about Scots Law. I was concerned that I wasn't receiving the

     same legal support and I recall that I asked if Scottish solicitors could be sought

     to assist and advise on whether there was sufficient evidence to submit a file to


                                        Page 7 of 44

                                                                                       WI TN08940100




     COPFS. I was advised to identify a suitable firm, and after researching some

     candidates I identified BTO LLP Solicitors. I believed they would be best suited

     as they employed a number of former Procurators Fiscal and had an office in

     Glasgow. I recall that I informed Jarnail Singh in POL Legal Services and I believe

     he contacted them and made arrangements for them to advise me on Scottish

     cases.


22. I dealt with Laura Irvine and Lindsay MacNeill at BTO, though mainly Laura. I

     recall that I arranged training for them on Horizon (which I think took place at the

     St Vincent Street Crown Office). I also made them aware of the Second Sight

     report, I either sent a copy or a link to the report. I mentioned on the document at

     POL00105145 that I advised BTO and the COPFS on cases at the time and

     archived cases in relation to the Second Sight review and cases where Horizon

     issues were raised, but I can't recall which cases.


23. In 2013 1 also arranged for Laura Irvine and Lindsay MacNeill to provide

     Courtroom Awareness training for the auditors in Scotland (the document at

     POL00139816 is a copy of the presentation they gave). I and my colleague, Mike

     Stanway, Investigation Manager, also gave a presentation.


24. I also mentioned on the document at POL00105145 that I had reviewed the layout

     of the report I submitted to the COPFS to bring it into line with the Police. I exhibit

     the amended versions of the forms at POL00118102 and POL00118103 to my

     statement as WITN08940101.


25. I believe that from 2006 all reports all non-Police authorities were required to be

     submitted to the COPFS electronically. This was to be through the COPFS

     Specialist Reporting Agency (SRA) website. I attended training at the Procurator


                                       Page 8 of 44

                                                                                   WI TN08940100




     Fiscal office in Glasgow. When my colleague Mike Stanway joined the team in

     2011, I arranged for him to attend a training session at the same office. Mike was

     based in England, but he was partnered with my myself to assist in Scottish

     cases.


26. Paragraph 3 of the Request asks me to describe my role in relation to disciplinary

     matters, interviewing suspects, disclosure, litigation case strategy and liaising

     with other POL departments regarding the progress of cases.


27. Regarding disciplinary matters, the only relevant role that I can recall is that I

     would submit a disciplinary report to the relevant Contracts Manager following a

     suspect interview, if this was required.


28. Regarding suspect interviews, I both led in interviews and sat in interviews as a

     second officer.


29. Regarding disclosure, my role involved disclosing information to solicitors

     representing suspects prior to an interview. As part of the prosecution process in

     England I would be required to complete the documents of the type at

     POL00051526 and POL00051527, and other disclosure forms. These forms are

     not required in Scotland.


30. I was not involved in any litigation case strategy.


31. Regarding liaising with other POL departments, in my role I liaised mainly with

     Contract Managers, the Former Agent Debt team and Cash Management. I can't

     recall if I liaised with any other departments.

The Security Team's role in relation to criminal investigations and prosecutions


32. Paragraph 4 of the Request draws my attention to a series of policies and

                                       Page 9 of 44
                                                                                   WI TNO8940100
                                                                                 WI TN08940100




     procedures, and paragraph 5 asks me to explain the organisational structure of

     the Security Team, my role in the development and/or management of any of

     these policies and procedures and to explain the legislation, policies and/or

     guidance that covered the conduct of investigations.


33. There have been a lot of changes in personnel and teams over the period I have

     worked in the Security Team, and the account I have given here is to the best of

     my knowledge. When I joined there was a Head of Security and Investigations

     who oversaw the following:


     33.1. The Investigation Team, with a Head of Investigations whose team dealt

           solely with investigations.


     33.1. The Security Team, who visited branches to advise on the physical

           security (e.g. safes, alarms, screens etc.).


     33.2. The Physical Security Team who dealt with updating and the purchase of

           new equipment (e.g. safes, alarms, screens etc.).


     33.3. The Casework Team, dealing with investigation case files.


34. In 2008, there was a restructure. The post of Senior Security Manager was

     introduced, and they reported to the Head of Security. The Senior Security

     Manager oversaw the following:


     34.1. The Commercial Team, though I can't recall their responsibilities.


     34.2. The Physical Team, whose role was to visit branches to advise on the

           physical security in branches.


     34.3. The Risk Team, who I believe dealt with Risk Management issues.

                                                                                 WI TN08940100




     34.4. The Assets Team, whose role was to update and purchase new security

            equipment.


     34.5. The Fraud Team, who undertook investigations.


     34.6. The Casework Team, who were responsible for the administration of

            investigation case files.


35. In 2011 Investigation Managers also took on the role that had been carried out

     by the Physical Team, along with their investigations role.


36. There was a further restructure in 2014/2015. A number of new teams were

     created, and the heads of those teams reported to the Head of Security.


     36.1. The Financial Crime Team, whose remit included money laundering

            reporting and suspicious activity reports.


     36.2. The Crime Risk Team, whose remit included risk management and, Crime

            Risk models.


     36.3. The Physical Security Team, responsible for physical assets (e.g. safes,

            alarms, screens etc.).


     36.4. The Security Operations Team, responsible for security and investigations.


     36.5. The Post Office Security Team and Intel team, who shared the same

            personnel and acted as a point of contact for Law Enforcement, dealing

            with robbery and burglary reports and ARQ requests.


37. In 2019 the team was streamlined. The Head of Security post had two direct

      37.1. The Security Intelligence and Strategy Manager, responsible for the Post

             Office Security/Intel team.


      37.2. The Security Operations Team Manager, who oversaw the Security

             Managers.


38. Paragraph 6 of the Request asks me to explain my role (if any) in the development

      and/or management of any of the policies listed in paragraph 4. To the best of my

      recollection, I was not involved in the development and/or management of the of

      any of these policies. (I refer later in my statement to the involvement I had in the

      development of the Mandatory Losses & Gains Policy for the Crown Office

      Network.)


39. Paragraph 7 of the Request asks me about the legislation, policies and/or

      guidance which governed the conduct of investigations by the Security Team

      during the period I worked within it and how these changed.


40. I am aware that there were several policies governing the conduct of

      investigations and that these were updated and sent to me over the period I

      worked within the Security Team. I would have read these, but I cannot recall the

      changes or when the documents were sent to me.


41. Paragraph 8 of the Request draws my attention to a series of documents and

      asks me to describe what, if any, impact there was on the conduct of

      investigations as a result of the separation of the Post Office from Royal Mail.


42.   My recollection is that there was no change to the conduct of investigations

      following the separation from Royal Mail. If there was a need for a joint

      investigation, there was a process to be followed, as set out in the document at


                                       Page 12 of 44

                                                                                   WI TN08940100




    POL00123312 (the Memorandum of Understanding between POL and Royal Mail

     on Joint Investigation Protocols).


43. Paragraph 9 of the Request asks me about the process for dealing with

     complaints about the conduct of an investigation by the Security Team. I don't

     recall having a complaint made against my conduct during an investigation by the

     Security Team. I'm unaware what the process would have been if a complaint

     was made.


44. Paragraph 10 of the Request asks me what (if any) supervision there was over

     criminal investigations conducted by the Security Team. Each month I was sent

     a "Cases on Hand" file listing all my cases. I had to provide updates on each

     case. If no update could be provided, you had to give a reason why.


45. Paragraph 11 of the Request asks me how Post Office policy and practice

     regarding the investigation and prosecution of Crown Office employees differed

    from the policy and practice regarding investigation and prosecution of

     subpostmasters ("SPMs"), their managers and assistants and if this changed

     during my time in the Security Team. I was aware of no such difference.


46. Paragraph 12 of the Request asks me to consider the document at POL00129339

     (a "Project Initiation Document" for a project called "Security Compliance and

     Safety" and dated 27 February 2013) and I am asked about the purpose of the

     project outlined in the document and my involvement in the project.


47. I am named as one of the members of the "Working Group" at section 3 of the

     document. The purpose of the project, as I recall, was to maintain the integrity of

     the Supply Chain sites and the safety of people and assets. My involvement was

     to manage the undertaking of the Operation Stripe Testing and Premises Attack

                                                                                   WI TN08940100




    Plans tests set out in the project for the Security Team North.


48. Paragraph 13 asks me to consider the email at document at POL00123863 (an

    email to me from Sharron Logan, Security Risk Programme Manager, dated 23

    February 2016) and the document at POL00088124 (the "Mandatory Losses &

    Gains Policy for the Crown Office Network", version 1.0 dated 24 April 2013), and

    asks me to describe the circumstances in which I received this email and the

    nature of any involvement I had in reviewing this policy.


49. I led the Directly Managed Branch ("DMB") programme (formerly the Crown

    Office programme) around this time. The DMB programme involved each

    Security Manager visiting an agreed number of branches in their area during the

    financial year, usually at least one per month. They completed an electronic

    toolkit and uploaded it to the programme's Sharepoint site. The toolkit covered

    topics on cash management, losses and gains, security procedures and physical

    security. Having considered the email at POL00123863, I can recall reviewing the

    document at POL00088125 (a draft version of the Mandatory Losses & Gains

    Policy) and I recall suggesting amendments to it, mainly:


    49.1. The reference to "Multiple Stock Units" at section 3, paragraph 5.b. I made

          the suggestion that units should be checked every eight weeks, which is

          what ended up being written into the final policy (at section 4, paragraph

          7.b.).


    49.2. The reference to "Snap Checks" at section 4, paragraph 7.a. I also made

          the suggestion that these should be carried out every eight weeks, which

          is what ended up being written into the final policy (at section 5, paragraph

          9.a.)

                                                                                    WI TN08940100




50. I did recommend other amendments, but these did not make it into the final

     document POL00088124. I have located a version of the document at

     POL00088125 which shows the amendments that I suggested (marked in red)

     and which I recall returning to Sharron Logan. I exhibit this document to my

     statement as WITN08940102.

Audit and investigation


51. Paragraph 14 of the Request draws my attention to the document at

     POL00104821 ("Condensed Guide for Audit Attendance", version 2 dated

     October 2008) and asks me to describe the circumstances in which an

     investigator would attend an audit of a branch and what an investigator's role

     was.


52. I have reviewed the document and believe that it is a document intended for the

     use of auditors, not investigators. The circumstances in which I would attend an

     audit of a branch as an investigator would be if the Fraud Analysis team identified

     an issue at a branch: for example, excess overnight cash holdings or supressed

     banking deposits. I might also be instructed to attend if the audit team on site

     identified a large discrepancy. My role on arrival was to discuss with the auditors

     their findings and gather any paperwork that would assist with a potential

     investigation.


53. Paragraph 15 of the Request asks me about who decided, if a shortfall was

     identified, whether an investigation into criminal activity should be conducted or

     if the case should be pursued as a debt recovery case, and the triggers/criteria

     for raising a fraud case.


54. The decision on whether an investigation would be pursued or not was, I believe,

                                     Page 15 of 44
                                                                                       WI TNO8940100
                                                                                     WI TN08940100




     made by Senior Management or Line Management within the Security Team. I

     am not aware of any local contract managers having any input in the decision

     making. Over the time I have worked in the Security Team, there were triggers

     for raising cases and they changed multiple times over the years. I can't recall all

     the levels at which triggers had been set, but I believe they ranged from £1,000

     to £50,000.

The process followed by Security Team investigators when conducting a
criminal investigation following the identification of a shortfall at an audit


55. Paragraph 16 of the Request asks, once a decision had been made to conduct a

     criminal investigation, what process the Security Team investigators followed in

     conducting their initial investigation.


56. On receipt of the Case Raised form, I would consider the enquiry. If it related to

     a Sub Post Office, I would contact POL Human Resources to request the

     postmaster's print-out and P356 assistant list, which included all Horizon User

     IDs. If it related to a Crown Office, I would ask for the employee printout. If the

     information in the Case Raised form related to an audit shortage, if the

     information had not already been provided, I would contact the lead auditor and

     request the relevant reports from Horizon, Office Balance, Stock Unit(s)

     balance(s) and snapshot(s) for any stock units, Cash Declarations, User IDs and

     any relevant forms.


57. If a suspect was identified, they would be contacted and invited to interview. They

     would be made aware of their right to a solicitor and their right to have a friend to

     be present at the interview (we would send the forms POL001(S) "Legal Rights

     Scotland" form and POL003 "Friend" form). Latterly I also told suspects that, if

     they were a member of the NFSP, they could contact their local rep for advice.

                                       Page 16 of 44
                                                                                     WI TN08940100
                                                                                   WI TN08940100




58. Once an interview had been conducted, the relevant paperwork was completed

     (for example the Suspect Offender report and Financial Investigation form) any

     further lines of enquiry made, any statements taken, then a report would be

     submitted for a decision to be made to prosecute or not.


59. In answering this question, I have considered the documents at POL00031005,

     POL00027863 and POL00030902, being the most recent versions of the

     "Conduct of Criminal Investigations Policy" (dated 2013, 2014 and 2018

     respectively). I note the flowchart set out in the policies, which would have been

     the process to follow for a case in England. For Scottish cases, the process in

     the flowchart at page 3 of documents POL00031005 and POL00027863 would

     have been followed up to "Criminal Law Team to review the case file. Proceed

     with case?". I don't recall Cartwright King being involved in the process for

     Scottish cases; I believe they were returned to me with a decision from POL's

     Criminal Law team. If the decision was to proceed to prosecution, I would then

     submit the file to the COPFS. If the decision was not to proceed, that case would

     be closed. This was the process that was in place before we engaged BTO.

Decisions about prosecution and criminal enforcement proceedings


60. Paragraph 17 of the Request asks, once an initial investigation was carried out,

     who decided whether a SPM, their manager(s) and / or assistant(s) or a Post

     Office employee should be prosecuted and what considerations determined

     whether a prosecution was brought; I am also asked about whether this changed

     during my time the Security Team.


61. In England and Wales, I believe POL's Criminal/Legal team would be responsible

     for the decision on whether a Post Office employee, SPM, their managers or


                                     Page 17 of 44
                                                                                     WI TNO8940100
                                                                                   WI TN08940100




     assistants would be prosecuted by POL. I believe their decision would have been

     informed by the evidence detailed in the report.


62. In Scotland, only COPFS can bring prosecutions. A report would be submitted to

     them and, if they were requested, all productions (exhibits) were provided.


63. Paragraph 18 of the Request asks, if a branch was run by a SPM, whether the

     SPM's local contract manager had any input into this decision-making process

     and if this changed during my time the Security Team. I am not aware of local

     Contract Managers having any input to the decision making during my role in the

     Security Team.


64. Paragraph 19 of the Request asks me about the test applied by those making

     prosecution and charging decisions and the factors which were considered at the

     evidential and the public interest stage. I'm not aware what test was applied in

     the decision making or what factors were considered at the evidential and the

     public interest stage. I played no role in the decision-making, and would expect

     the Criminal Law team to decide in England and the COPFS in Scotland.


65. Paragraph 20 of the Request asks what legal and other advice was provided to

     those making prosecution decisions. I am not aware what advice legal or

     otherwise was provided to those making decisions about whether to prosecute

     and what charges to bring.


66. Paragraph 21 of the Request asks in what circumstances steps were to restrain

     a suspect's assets by criminal enforcement methods. Following an interview, I

     completed a Financial Evaluation Sheet with the financial details provided by the

     interviewee. These were submitted with my report. These would be passed to a

     Financial Investigator to action if necessary. POL Financial Investigators didn't

                                     Page 18 of 44
                                                                                      WI TNO8940100
                                                                                    WI TN08940100




     have the authority to restrain a suspect's assets in Scotland. I believe Police

     Scotland have Financial Investigators, but I'm not aware of their powers. When I

     submitted a case through the COPFS Specialist Reporting Agency website, I was

     asked if compensation was sought. This didn't guarantee compensation would

     be granted; that decision was ultimately for the court.


67. Paragraph 22 of the Request asks who decided whether criminal enforcement

     proceedings should be pursued and the factors they considered when making

     decisions. I'm not aware if it was the Financial Investigators or senior

     management who decided if enforcement proceedings should be pursued or the

     factors considered.

Training, instructions and guidance to investigators within the Security Team


68. Paragraph 23 of the request asks what instructions, guidance and 1 or training

     were given to investigators within the Security Team on a range of topics and

     how was this provided.


69. Regarding training in interviewing suspects, I recall this was covered in my initial

     training when I joined the Security Team in 2005. We were taught interview

     techniques and how to ask questions. There were role play exercises, with the

     trainers taking on the roles of suspects; we were given a scenario and tasked

     with interviewing a suspect.


70. Regarding taking witness statements, I recall that this was also covered in my

     initial training. We were given scenarios and had to practice taking statements

     from the trainers and fellow attendees.


71. Regarding conducting searches, I recall that as part of my initial training that I



                                     Page 19 of 44
                                                                                           WI TNO8940100
                                                                                         WI TN08940100




     have described above, we were taken to a house in the Police College near

     London. I assisted in conducting a search, looking for items that had been pre-

     placed in the property. We were also trained on how to compete the necessary

     forms.


72. Regarding the investigator's duties in carrying out investigations, I recall during

     the initial training that we were taught to ensure all evidence is obtained, lines of

     enquiries are completed, mitigating circumstances are considered and

     investigated, and interviews are conducted within guidelines. All activities taken

     were to be recorded on the Event Log.


73. Regarding obtaining evidence in the course of an investigation, also during initial

     training we were taught that the investigator must obtain all original documents

     (for example, in the event of an audit shortage, audit cash sheets, Horizon reports

     printed at the time of the audit, Branch Trading Statements and Horizon reports

     produced by the branch).


74. The initial training also taught us about obtaining evidence from third parties who

     might hold relevant evidence. For example, banks statements, if it was suspected

     a shortfall was due to the monies being deposited into a suspect's bank account

     using Horizon. Also, ARQ requests to Fujitsu in order to obtain Horizon data in

     various cases (for example, to investigate deposits into bank accounts in Post

     Office Card Account cases involving a vulnerable person duped into making

     multiple withdrawals).


75. Regarding an investigator's disclosure obligations, the initial training taught us

     that, in England, it is the duty of the investigator provide a record of all information

     obtained and to disclose all relevant information to the prosecution and defence.


                                       Page 20 of 44
                                                                                        WI TN08940100
                                                                                      WI TN08940100




     I learned on taking up my role in Scotland that it is the duty of the investigator to

     do the same as in England, with the exception information is provided to the

     COPFS. The COPFS considers whether the information meets the disclosure test

     before disclosing the information. I attended some training on disclosure provided

     by, and have located a copy of the presentation that was given which I exhibit to

     my statement as POL00129134.


76. Regarding drafting investigation reports, the initial training taught us that the

     Offender report must contain a "preamble", for example, in the case of an audit

     shortage, the details of the audit, the suspect interview (including evidence put to

     the   suspect), exhibits/productions,     details of    witness   statements,    any

     denials/admissions made, any follow up enquiries and a summary of the

     evidence.


77. Paragraph 24 of the Request draws my attention to the document at

     POL00121680 (an email from Andrew Daley dated 6 September 2010 that was

     sent to me and a number of others, together with its attachments at

     P0L00104837, P0L00104848, P0L00064059 and P0L00124232) and I am

     asked where I was based when I received this email, whether this was the first

     time I had been sent these materials and if any presentation about them was

     given.


78. The documents relate to some procedures and standards that had been

     developed in relation to committal papers. At the time I received the email at

     document POL00121680 I was based in Scotland. I can't recall exactly when I

     received the materials, but it is my belief that this would have been the first

     occasion on which I saw them. I can't recall receiving the presentation that is


                                      Page 21 of 44

                                                                                     WI TN08940100




     referred to in the email.


79. Paragraph 25 of the Request asks me to consider the document at POL00129144

     (an email from Roslyn Simpson dated 5 October 2010 and the attachment at

     document POL00129145) and I am asked to explain the circumstances in which

     I was due to attend the "Specialist Reporting Agencies — Disclosure Course"

     referred to in these documents, whether I attended it and whether I was based in

     Scotland at the time.


80. I believe I was asked to attend the training as I was the investigation manager

     covering Scotland (being based in Scotland at that time). I recall that I did attend

     on 20 October 2010.


81. Paragraph 26 of the Request draws my attention to a series of documents relating

     to casework management and paragraph 27 asks me a series of questions about

     them.


82. I don't recall being provided with the 2000 and 2002 versions of the Casework

     Management document at POL00104747 and POL00104777 during my time in

     the Security Team. I cannot therefore say what I might have understood the

     instructions / guidance given in second, third and fourth bullet points on page 2

     of the 2000 version and the first, second and third bullet points on page 2 of the

     2002 version to mean. Had I considered them at the time, I don't think I would

     have considered them to be relevant to disclosure obligations in relation to

     information about Horizon bugs, errors and defects, as I wasn't aware of any

     bugs, errors or defects until I became aware of the Second Sight report.


83. To the best of my recollection, the compliance checks referred to in David

     Posnett's email of 23 May 2011 at POL00118096 had been introduced prior to

                                     Page 22 of 44
                                                                                        WI TN08940100
                                                                                      WI TN08940100




     2011 to apply a consistent approach in investigations and the submission of the

     "green jackets". ("Green jacket" refers to a folder which, on the outside, displays

     the case file number, the type of enquiry and the branch name. It also displays

     the date you received the file, who you send it to, the date sent etc. The jacket

     contains all the forms relevant to the case, information, reports, with Appendix

     folders for witness statements (Appendix A), evidence (Appendix B) and

     correspondence (Appendix C).) I can't recall exactly when they were introduced

     or if there were any inconsistencies in investigations or green jacket submissions

     prior to the compliance checks being introduced. The checks I believe were

     conducted by the Casework Managers.


84. I had no role in relation to the development, management or amendment of the

     suite of compliance documents attached to David Posnett's email.


85. I have been asked to set out what I understood by paragraph 2.15 of the

     document at POL00118101 ("Guide to the Preparation and Layout of

     Investigation Red Label Case Files — Offender reports & Discipline reports"), how

     this related to the document at POL00118102 (Offender Report template), and

     its relevance to the Post Office's disclosure obligations (and in particular as they

     related to information about Horizon bugs, errors and defects).


86. I don't exactly recall the document at POL00118101, but I do recall that there

     were requirements which governed the preparation and layout of case files. My

     understanding of paragraph 2.15 of the document at POL00118101 is that any

     failures in "security, supervision, procedures and product integrity" identified that

     led to a crime being committed were to be included in the Offender report.


87. I have considered the document at POL00118104 (titled "Identification Codes"


                                      Page 23 of 44
                                                                                     WI TNO8940100
                                                                                   WI TN08940100




    and attached to David Posnett's email of 23 May 2011). I don't recall ever having

    seen this document. I do not know who drafted the document. I find the

    descriptions attached to the codes to be disgusting and racist. As to why Security

    Team investigators were instructed to assign identification codes to suspected

    offenders, my understanding is that identification codes were already in place

    when I started as an investigation manager. I took them as being a standard entry

    of the Offender and Discipline reports. I have some recollection that I had a file,

    possibly an Excel file, which described IC codes 1 to 4, but I cannot now locate

    this. I do know that it didn't resemble the document at POL00118104. In my

    experience, the only codes I recall every having to use regularly were ICI and

    IC4.

Analysing Horizon data, requesting ARQ data from Fujitsu and relationship with
Fujitsu


88. Paragraph 28 of the Request asks what analysis (if any) was done by Security

    Team investigators of Horizon data when a SPM / SPM's manager(s) or

    assistant(s) / Crown Office employee(s) attributed a shortfall to problems with

    Horizon. If a shortfall was claimed to be attributed to Horizon, I cannot recall if

    data and a statement was requested from Fujitsu or only a statement. I didn't

    carry out analysis on the Horizon system, this was conducted by Fujitsu.


89. Paragraph 29 of the Request asks ARQ data requested from Fujitsu as a matter

    of course when a shortfall had been identified and the relevant SPM / SPM's

    manager(s) or assistant(s) / Crown Office employee(s) attributed the shortfall to

    problems with Horizon. ARQ data was not requested from Fujitsu as a matter of

    course. It would only have been requested if it was relevant to an enquiry.


90. Paragraph 30 of the Request asks whether ARQ data, when it was obtained from

                                    Page 24 of 44
                                                                                         WI TNO8940100
                                                                                       WI TN08940100




     Fujitsu, was provided to the SPM in question as a matter of course. I don't recall

     the data ever being provided to the SPM.


91. Paragraph 31 of the Request asks me to consider the documents at

     FUJO0225725 (email correspondence between July and September 2010

     relating to a request I made for ARQ data for Bridgeton Post Office) and

     FUJO0226055 (emails between Cartwright King solicitors and Gareth Jenkins of

     Fujitsu, 28 November 2012) and I am asked to describe the circumstances in

     which I would have contact with Fujitsu when I worked within the Security Team

     and the relevant contacts at Fujitsu.


92. Initial contact with Fujitsu was made through our Security Team. On reviewing

     the document at FUJO0225725 I can see that my initial request was made to

     "Post Office Security". I was not in direct contact with either Penny Thomas or

     Gareth Jenkins. I would only contact Fujitsu if it was specifically required for case.

     The documents at FUJ00156984, FUJ00156985, FUJ00156994, FUJO0156998

     and FUJO0157004 show some emails that I exchanged with Andy Dunks, who

     worked in Security Operations within Fujitsu, during 2017-2018. I contacted Andy

     Dunks directly as I had been copied in on correspondence with him and therefore

     had his contact details.


93. Paragraph 32 of the Request asks what role I understood Gareth Jenkins to have

     relation to the criminal prosecutions he was involved in. I recall Gareth Jenkins'

     name, and note that he was sent an email in November 2012 (document

     FUJ00226055) which refers to him providing a report in a case in 2012 in which

    I was to be a witness. Other than that I don't recall any involvement he had in

     relation to criminal prosecutions.

                                                                                          WI TN08940100
                                                                                       WI TN08940100




94. Paragraph 33 of the Request asks me to what extent did I considered Gareth

     Jenkins to be acting as an expert witness, my understanding of the rules

     governing independent expert evidence and who provided advice or assistance

     to me in this in this regard. Other than what I described in paragraph 93 above, I

     don't recall Gareth Jenkins' involvement in relation to criminal prosecutions. Other

     than those cases where Fujitsu staff were asked to provide witness statements,

     I don't recall having to request an expert witness in any of my cases.

Relationship with others


95. Paragraph 34 of the Request asks me to describe my involvement with Cartwright

     King Solicitors, including the level of interaction that I typically had in a case (and

     the roles I had) and my contacts. Personally, I had very little interaction with

     Cartwright King Solicitors, as my involvement was mainly with Scottish cases. I

     do remember a meeting with Cartwright King Solicitors regarding the case

     mentioned in the document at FUJ00226055. As I recall, the case related to a

     shortage at Winlaton Post Office, in north-east England, and I was the lead

     investigator. I recall that the meeting was with Rachel Panter and another person

     who may have been Martin Smith. I can't recall the details of the meeting or what

     was discussed.

Involvement in the Criminal Case Studies

Prosecution of Peter Holmes


96. Paragraph 35 of the Request asks me to provide a full account of my involvement

     in and my recollection of the criminal prosecution of Peter Holmes and I am asked

     to consider the documents referred to in Paragraph 36.


97. Paragraph 37 of the Request asks me how and when I first become involved in


                                       Page 26 of 44
                                                                                       WI TN08940100
                                                                                     WI TN08940100




     this case. I can't recall exactly how I first became involved, but I expect I would

     have been contacted by my Line Manager at the time and informed that I would

     be leading the case, with Chris Knight as the second officer.


98. Paragraph 38 of the Request asks me if I was aware of any allegations made by

     Peter Holmes relating to the reliability of the Horizon IT system and, if so, what I

     thought the significance of this was. Mr Holmes indicated during interview that

     the loss may be down to the Horizon system. At the time, I don't believe I would

     have been aware of the significance of this, as I don't recall being aware of any

     issues with Horizon at the time. Mr Holmes said he couldn't explain the losses,

     and didn't believe anyone else in the office had stolen any money.


99. Paragraph 39 of the Request asks me about my role in relation to the audit of

     Jesmond Branch undertaken on 18 September 2008. I was not involved in the

     decision to conduct an audit at Jesmond Post Office and I don't recall why the

     audit was undertaken. I believe I was emailed the audit report on 18 September

     2008; I believe this to be the case because I would have had to have had the

     report before I travelled down to Newcastle on 19 September. It would have been

     provided by Mike Webb, Lead Auditor, or the Casework team.


100. Paragraph 40 of the Request asks me to explain how the search at Jesmond Post

     Office was conducted and my role, if any, in that search. I can't now recall

     conducting a search at Jesmond Post Office.


101. Paragraph 41 of the Request asks me about the decision to search Mr Holmes'

     home on 19 September 2008 and the conduct of the search. The decision to carry

     out a search followed POL policy: we were instructed to conduct searches to

     preserve any evidence. I can't recall how we conducted the search, but looking


                                      Page 27 of 44
                                                                                          WI TN08940100
                                                                                        WI TN08940100




     at the document at POL00060805, I can see that I was accompanied by Chris

     Knight and Mark Haddrell. We would have searched one room at a time, with Mr

     Holmes being present. Looking at page 7 of the document at POL00060805, I

     can see that I recorded the first item, found by myself. After this, I can see that all

     other items found were recorded against Chris Knight and Mark Haddrell, which

     suggests they continued the search.


102. Paragraph 42 of the Request asks me whose decision was it to interview Mr

     Holmes. Again, decision the decision to interview Mr Holmes followed policy. As

     an investigator, I was expected to interview a suspect as part of an enquiry.


103. Paragraph 43 of the Request asks what my view was of Mr Holmes' assertion in

     his interview (at page 8 of the document at POL00050208) that the only way he

     could explain the losses were "it's the Horizon that's let us down". My view was

     that Mr Holmes' assertion needed following up. I can see that there was a request

     made for the ARQ data (as I discuss elsewhere in my statement) but I can't recall

     if a request for a witness statement from Fujitsu was made. I can't remember now

     what my view would have been about Mr Holmes' assertion about Horizon.


104. Paragraph 44 of the Request asks me to consider my investigation reports at

     documents POL00050334 and POL00050832. In particular, my report at

     POL00050334 refers to a request being made to ascertain whether Horizon

     equipment at the Jesmond Branch was faulty. I note that at POL00050832, at

     page 7, my report says that checks had revealed no problems with Horizon. I

     cannot recall what checks were carried out in relation to Horizon at the branch,

     who carried out the checks or what the results where. I've considered all the

     documents and can't find anything in relation to the request or the results of the


                                       Page 28 of 44
                                                                                      W ITNO8940100
                                                                                    W ITN08940100




     checks.


105. Paragraph 45 of the Request asks me to consider the document at POL00050255

     (the Suspect Offender Reporting form) which advises that Mr Holmes was

     suspended on the authority of Brian Trotter, and asks what input, if any, I had in

     the decision. I had no input into the decision to suspend Mr Holmes.


106. Paragraph 46 of the Request has asked me to consider the witness statements

     of Thelma Crerand (Assistant Manager, Jesmond Post Office) (POL00047293),

     Vicky Mitchell (Post Office Assistance, Jesmond Post Office) (POL00047294),

     Doreen Corcoran (Counter Clerk, Jesmond Post Office) (POL00051515) and

     Jenera Begum (Counter Clerk, Jesmond Post Office)(POL00043887) and about

     my role in relation to obtaining these statements. I can't recall who decided that

     each of the individuals should provide a witness statement or at what stage in the

     investigation was it decided that they should provide witness statements.


107. My role in taking witness statements involved asking each of the witnesses

     questions, and I captured their answers/comments on the statement. I don't recall

     giving the witnesses any information prior to them giving their statements, in this

     case or indeed in any other case. I asked all the witnesses if they were aware of

     any problems with Horizon and all said they weren't aware of any problems.


108. Paragraph 47 of the Request asks me to consider the financial evaluation sheet

     completed for Mr Holmes at document POL00043951, the enquiries made to

     Barclays bank at document POL00050821, the results of those enquiries at

     document POL00060806 and the witness statement of Sunil Khanna in relation

     to the salary paid to Mr Holmes, at document UKG100014640, and asks me about

     the investigation into Mr Holmes' finances.


                                     Page 29 of 44
                                                                                         WI TNO8940100
                                                                                       WI TN08940100




109. I can't recall what the investigation into Mr Holmes' personal finances revealed. I

     recall that I did obtain the statement from Sunil Khanna in relation to Mr Holmes's

     wages. I can't recall the investigation or who I would have reported the results of

     those investigations to. I'm not aware if the outcome of those investigations

     factored into the decision whether there was sufficient evidence to charge Mr

     Holmes.


110. Paragraph 48 of the Request refers me to the documents at POL00043951 (the

     Financial Evaluation Sheet completed in this case) and POL00051984 (witness

     statement of Laura Currie of the Alliance and Leicester dated 26 August 2009)

     and asked me about the investigations into the finances of Mr Holmes' wife's

     business. The only bank statement that I can recall obtaining related to Mr and

     Mrs Holmes' joint account, I don't recall obtain statements relating to her business

     account.


111. Paragraph 49 of the Request asks me to explain any further sources of

     information I considered during the investigation. I can't recall if any other sources

     of information were considered during the investigation.


112. Paragraph 50 of the Request asks if any Horizon data (and in particular ARQ

     logs) requested from Fujitsu in this case. I note that on page 2 of my investigation

     report dated 6 October 2008 (POL00050334) I said that "Horizon data has been

     requested". I do not believe I would have said this if it hadn't been requested.

     Similarly, page 6 of my investigation report dated 30 January 2009

     (POL00050832) refers to Horizon data having been "received and analysed".

     Again, I do not believe I would have said this if this hadn't been done. I note the

     Court of Appeal's judgment in Josephine Hamilton & Others v Post Office Limited


                                      Page 30 of 44
                                                                                   WI TN08940100
                                                                                 WI TN08940100




     (POL00113278) which advised (at paragraph 229) that ARQ data was obtained

     but that it was not clear if it was disclosed.


113. Paragraph 51 of the Request asks if I obtained legal advice at any stage of the

     investigation. Having considered various documents referred to in the Request, I

     can see that I corresponded with Juliet McFarlane, Principal Lawyer in the POL

     Criminal Law Division, at various stages of the case. This would have been to

     inform her of progress, seek advice on the next steps and discuss the expert

     accountant's report.


114. Paragraph 52 of the Request asks what role, if any, I played in the decision to

     prosecute Mr Holmes and refers to the documents at POL00050865 (memo from

     Terry Crowther, Fraud Team, dated 4 February 2009) and POL00050912 (memo

     from Juliet McFarlane, dated 16 February 2009).


115. I have also reviewed the reports I made at documents POL00050334 and

     POL00050832. In both reports I said that I saw no reason why POL should not

     proceed with prosecution. This was my view based on the evidence gathered.

     The decision was not ultimately mine to take. The file would be submitted to the

     DAM (I think this stood for "Decision Authority Manager") to decide whether POL

     should proceed to prosecute or not. The file was then sent to Legal Services for

     a legal/final decision.


116. Paragraph 53 of the Request refers me to the documents at POL00066227 (Juliet

     McFarlane's attendance note of her call with me on 10 November 2009) and

     POL00043846 (the Schedule of Charges) and asks what role, if any, I played in

     deciding on and/or drafting the charge faced by Mr Holmes. I would have played

     no part in drafting the charge faced by Mr Holmes at document at POL00043846.


                                       Page 31 of 44

                                                                                    WI TN08940100




     I don't recall the actual conversation I had with Juliet McFarlane and recorded in

     the document at POL00066227 and whether it came before or after the drafted

     charge.


117. Paragraph 54 of the Request asks me who was the disclosure officer in this case

     and paragraph 55 asks me to explain my role in relation to disclosure. As the lead

     investigator I would have been the disclosure officer. My role would have been to

     ensure all appropriate material used and unused was disclosed to the prosecution

     and defence.


118. Paragraph 56 of the Request asks me what role I played in preparing for the

     prosecution and refers to the documents at POL00050940 and POL00050978

     (letters I sent to Gosforth Magistrates Court in February and March 2009),

     POL00051080 (a memo I sent to Juliet McFarlane on 9 March 2009),

     POL00051205 (a memo Juliet McFarlane sent to the Fraud Team, and copied to

     me, on 18 March 2009) and POL00066225 (Juliet McFarlane's attendance note

     of her call with me on 13 August 2009).


119. My letters to the Magistrates Court were in connection with arranging a court date.

     I obtained a summons and sent it to Mr Holmes. I then informed Juliet McFarlane

     that the summons had been served by Royal Mail Special Delivery. Juliet

     McFarlane then informed me of the prosecuting agent on behalf of POL.

     Document POL00066225 states I held a discussion with Legal Services

     regarding Mr Khanna's statement and the documents mentioned in his statement.

     I can't recall the details of the conversation. I would also have prepared the

     committal bundle, but as I was not so experienced in dealing with cases in the

     English courts, I recall that I was provided with assistance to do this.

120. Paragraph 57 of the Request asks me to consider the documents at

     POL00052028 and POL00052037 (emails referencing a request I made for the

     Event Logs for Jesmond Post Office in July 2009) and asks me to describe the

     disclosure requests made by the defence and how these were responded to. The

     request I made was, I believe, for the alarm logs for Jesmond Post Office. These

     would have been disclosed to the defence.


121. Paragraph 58 of the Request asks what, if any, further enquiries I conducted after

     receiving the defence expert report and about my response to the report. I recall

     receiving the expert accountant's report (at document POL00052103). I cannot

     recall conducting further enquiries or what my response to the report, but having

     considered document UKG100014638 (an email I sent to Juliet McFarlane on 19

     August 2009), I can see I that I was of the opinion that, without seeing the

     business' daily takings for the period in question, I couldn't agree with the expert

     accountant's conclusions.


122. Paragraph 59 of the Request asks me to consider Mr Holmes' defence statement,

     dated 30 July 2009 (at document POL00052178 and POL00052193) and asks

     me about my observations of the statement and my role in addressing the matters

     raised in it. In particular, it asks me how I responded to Mr Holmes' statement that

     "I do not believe that Royal Mail has conducted a thorough investigation and did

     not consider any alternative in relation to the allegation".


123. I do not recall receiving the defence statement but accept I would have received

     it, as I am copied into the memo dated 5 August 2009 at POL00052193. I don't

     recall what view, if any, I had about the contents of the defence statement.


124. Paragraph 60 of the Request asks me to consider the defence representations,

                                                                                          WI TN08940100
                                                                                       WI TN08940100




    dated 24 August 2009 (at POL00052389) which were copied to me on 4

    September 2009 (under cover of the document at POL00052391) and asks me

    about my views on the representations and on the defence accountant's findings.

    I don't recall receiving the defence representations. I note at document

    POL00053521 that the daily takings records were obtained, but I don't recall

    viewing these.


125. Paragraph 61 of the Request refers to the document at POL00060822 (Juliet

    McFarlane's memo of 25 September 2009 recording that the Crown rejected the

    basis of plea of false accounting but not theft) and asks what role I had in deciding

    to reject the basis of plea. I don't recall having any input into the decision to reject

    the basis of plea, or being aware of the rationale on which the decision was

    based.


126. Paragraph 62 of the Request asks me to consider the further defence

    representations dated 16 November 2009, at document POL00053521 and

    copied to me on 24 November 2009 (under cover of the document at

    POL00053598) and asks me about my response to these representations,

    whether a conference with counsel was arranged and my role in that conference.

    I can't recall responding to the representations or if a conference with counsel

    was arranged.


127. Paragraph 63 of the Request refers to the document at POL00053795

    referencing that Mr Holmes pleaded guilty to a revised indictment on 22

    December 2009, and asks what my views were about this at the time. I don't

    recall having any views on this at the time.


128. Paragraph 64 of the Request refers to the document at POL00054149 (a memo


                                      Page 34 of 44
                                                                                      WI TN08940100
                                                                                    WI TN08940100




     dated 17 February 2010 recording the sentence imposed on Mr Holmes) and

     asks me what my response was. I don't believe I made a response at the time.


129. Paragraph 65 of the Request refers to the documents at POL00054544 and

     POL00054543 (containing emails exchanged in March 2010 regarding

     enforcement proceedings) and POL00054790 (the Case Closure Reporting form

     I sent on 23 May 2010) and asks me what criminal enforcement proceedings

     were taken against Mr Holmes and about my involvement in these proceedings.

     I believe consideration was given to recovering the money from Mr Holmes,

     initially, but page 3 of the document at POL00054543 shows that POL resolved

     to seek recovery from the SPM. My only involvement was to forward a debarment

     notice regarding Mr Holmes, as I mention on the Case Closure Reporting form at

     POL00054790.


130. Paragraph 66 of the Request asks me to describe any further involvement I had

     in this case. Other than what I have described elsewhere in this statement, I don't

     recall any further involvement in the case.


131. Paragraph 67 asks me what my reflections are now on the way the investigation

     and prosecution of Mr Holmes was conducted by the Post Office and the outcome

     of the case, and my attention is drawn to the judgment of the Court of Appeal in

     Josephine Hamilton & Others v Post Office Limited at document POL00113278.


132. I have considered the Court of Appeal judgment, and in particular paragraphs

     226 to 230 relating to Mr Holmes. I noted the finding at paragraph 229 that ARQ

     data was obtained but that it was not clear if it was disclosed. I acknowledge that

     ARQ data was obtained, but cannot recall whether or not it was disclosed. If it

     was not disclosed, I cannot now offer a reason why that was.

Prosecutions in the Devolved Nations


133. Paragraph 68 of the Request draws my attention to a series of documents and

     paragraph 69 asks me to describe how I became involved in the investigation and

     prosecution of cases in the devolved nations, particularly Scotland. I was

     recruited to the Security Team to work in Scotland as I based in Glasgow.


134. Paragraph 70 of the Request asked about my experience of the Scottish legal

     system before I became involved in this work. I had no experience of the Scottish

     Legal system prior to my role as a Security Manager.


135. Paragraph 71 of the Request asks me to describe the process by which cases

     were investigated and prosecuted in Scotland, how the process in Scotland

     differed from England and Wales and any ways in which the process in Scotland

     changed during the time I was involved.


136. The conduct of investigations in Scotland was similar to England and Wales, the

     key difference was in the prosecution of cases. As I have described elsewhere in

     this statement, the prosecuting authority in Scotland is the COPFS. All cases,

     whether they be Police or non-Police cases, have to be submitted to the COPFS,

     who then decide whether to proceed to prosecution or not. In around 2006, it

     became a requirement that non-Police authorities had to report cases through

     the COPFS Specialist Reporting Agency website. On inputting a case, you had

     to input a charge to proceed to submission.


137. The process also differed in that in Scotland corroboration of evidence is required;

     you need to have two separate sources of evidence. For example, if a person

     transacts a deposit into their bank account using Horizon without putting the

     money in the drawer, the two sources of evidence could be drawn from the

                                      Page 36 of 44
                                                                                         WI TN08940100
                                                                                       WI TN08940100




     Horizon data, bank statements, CCTV, or witness evidence.


138. Another difference was that prior to 2010, a suspect didn't have a right to a

     solicitor. This changed in 2010 with the Supreme Court decision in Cadder v HM

     Advocate. From 2010, anyone being interviewed under caution had to be offered

     a solicitor to be present. The email exchanges documented at POL00121659 are

     referring to the procedural changes which would be required following this

     decision.


139. Another difference is that, in England, we are only required to summarise the tape

     transcripts from an interview, while in Scotland we are required to type out the full

     tape transcripts from an interview.


140. Paragraph 72 of the Request asks me to provide details of the individuals I

     worked with on cases in Scotland. Those that I can recall were Raymond Grant

     and Shirley Stockdale, who were based in Scotland along with Judith Trotter,

     Tony Robertson, Diane Matthews, Steve Bradshaw, Mike Stanway, Andrew

     Wise, Kevin Ryan and Suzanne Winter.


141. Paragraph 73 of the Request asks me to describe any difficulties I encountered

     while working on cases in Scotland. I can't recall any particular difficulties.


142. Paragraph 74 of the Request refers me to the email chain dated 12 August 2013

     at document POL00139853 and asks me to explain the circumstances in which I

     was approached by the Crown for comment on prosecution cases; about any

     discussions I had with John Scott, Jarnail Singh or any other individual in the Post

     Office about this request; and who made the decision that I would not provide a

     statement and the reasons for this decision.

                                                                                        WI TN08940100




143. I can't recall the circumstances in which I was approached by the Crown or any

     discussions with John Scott or Jarnail Singh. It may be that the only contact I had

     with John Scott or Jarnail Singh was by email, but I can't now be certain about

     that. It seems to me likely that the decision that I would not provide a statement

     would have been one for John Scott and/or Jarnail Singh, and I suspect the

     reason for the decision was possibly that I was not qualified (legally or otherwise)

     to provide such a statement, but I can't be certain about this.

General


144. Paragraph 75 of the Request refers me to the documents at POL00124103 and

     POL00124105 (email correspondence in December 2017 referring to the

     outcome of a meeting about prosecution) and asked me to describe the

     circumstances in which I received the email and my understanding of the

     approach of the Post Office to "testing a case in the criminal court prior to the civil

     hearing". I can't recall the exact circumstances in which I received the email, I

     expect it was sent in order to update the Security Team on the business' position

     on prosecutions. I vaguely recall discussions on a test case but not the reasons

     behind it.


145. Paragraph 76 of the Request asked me to what extent (if any) I considered a

     challenge to the integrity of Horizon in one case to be relevant to other ongoing

     or future cases. I didn't consider any challenge to any one case being relevant to

     other ongoing cases or future cases. I recall that when I attended team meetings,

     the updates we were given were that a Subject Matter Expert would be coming

     "on board" and that the Horizon system was robust with no integrity issues.


146. There are no other matters that I consider are of relevance to the Inquiry's terms
