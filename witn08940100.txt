POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY

FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF ROBERT DAILY

|, Robert Daily, will say as follows:

Introduction

1. This witness statement is made to assist the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry (the
“Inquiry”) with the matters set out in the Rule 9 Request dated 3 October 2023
(the “Request”). | have received advice and assistance from a lawyer in the

preparation of this statement.

My professional background

2. 1am an employee of Post Office Ltd ("POL") and hold the position of Security
Manager. | joined POL on 17 December 1979. | have listed and summarised
below the roles | have held throughout my career to the present date, and the

approximate dates that | was in these roles, to the best of my recollection:

2.1. Counter clerk (grade Postal Officer), 1979-1984. This role involved

serving the general public. | had my own stock unit that | had to balance,
this was completed on a paper balance sheet. At end of a 12-month
probation period, | was sent to work in various branches before taking a

permanent position at George Square Crown Office in Glasgow.

Remittance Unit and TV Licence Records, 1984-1987. Working in the
Remittance Unit, | was placed on what were called "writing duties" and
worked on the "float", meaning that | was sent to various departments to
cover holidays and sick leave. | mainly worked in the Coin Centre in Thistle
Street, Glasgow (part of the Remittance Unit), processing coin from Post
Office branches and making up coin bags to send to Post Office branches.
Being on the float during this time meant that | also worked in TV Licence
Records, attending people's homes to check if they had a TV licence. If
they didn't, they could pay at the door and a receipt would be given, or |

would make a report to my Line Manager.

Remittance Unit, 1987-1989. During this period working in the
Remittance Unit, my role involved processing inward and outward
remittances from branches (this was before systems were computerised)

and processing business banking from external customers.

Cash Management, 1989-1993. In this role | processed the Overnight
Cash Holding figures sent in from Post Office branches and set daily

targets for Post Office branches.

Distribution, 1993-1997. This role involved monitoring the performance
of Remittance Units in the Northern Territory (Glasgow, Aberdeen, Dundee

and Belfast). | visited the units to perform time and motion studies of the

work carried out.

Security, 1997 to date. Initially, | worked as a Postal Officer (between
1997-2004), ordering parts for parcel hatches, contacting contractors to
attend branches to repair security equipment, project work (e.g. the screen
2000 upgrade of screens in Post Offices), arranging contractors, and
liaising with Post Offices to arrange suitable dates for this work to be

carried out.

Since 2005 | have worked as a Security and Investigations Manager,
performing various roles. (| had applied unsuccessfully for this post in
about 1999 or 2000, | recall). | describe this role in more detail later in my
statement, but to summarise: in this role | investigate crime or suspected
crime against POL, collate paperwork, identify suspects, arrange and
conduct interviews and submit reports to the Casework team for decisions.
In outline, when a decision is taken not proceed to prosecution, the case
is closed; if a decision is taken to proceed, | submit a report to the Crown
Office & Procurator Fiscal Service ("COPFS"). If the COPFS decides to
proceed with a prosecution, | provide the productions (i.e. exhibits)
supporting the case to COPFS. Latterly (as | explain elsewhere in this
statement) BTO (aka Brechin, Tindall, Oates) Solicitors LLP, were
employed to advise on reports and evidence. | liaised with BTO regarding
the content of my reports to ensure | had covered all enquiries and there

was sufficient evidence to either proceed to prosecution or not.

My "security" role includes attending branches to conduct security reviews,

give advice, and check equipment is being used correctly. | also carry out

Page 3 of 44
WITNO08940100
WITN08940100

visits and/or phone calls after an incident at a branch (such as a

robbery/burglary).

The Request asks me to give an account of my role as a Security/Investigations
Manager from 2005, including how | became an Investigations Manager, the
experience | had and the training | received, my understanding of what the role
involved, who | reported to, and my opinion on the competence and

professionalism of my colleagues and managers.

| joined the Security & Investigation team as an Investigation Manager in 2005.
In 2011 my role changed to Security & Investigation Manager and my current role

is as a currently Security Manager.

| applied for the job of Investigation Manager in 2004. The role was advertised as
temporary for six months. | was successful in the interview and was appointed.
When the temporary six-month period came to an end, | was informed my position

was being made permanent.

| have been asked to consider my CV, the document at POL00105143. This
contains an account of my skills and experience acquired in the role of
Investigations Manager from January 2005. My recollection is that the Security &
Investigations Team, as it was known then, underwent a reorganisation in 2008,

and | was required to submit my CV.

| have also been asked to consider the document at POL00129121, which
appears to be a statement | made in support if an application for the role of
Investigation Manager. Again, | believe this to be from either 2008 or 2014 when
| had to apply for my role as an Investigation Manager during the organisational

restructures in those years.

All the experience and expertise | have has been acquired through working in my
role. | have not pursued any formal qualifications for my role. | have also
undergone training, and set out below an account of the training that | recall being

given.

| say in my CV at POL00105143 that | had the knowledge and skills required for
the position of Investigation Manager, and that | had knowledge of the corporate
investigations policies and standards. | believe that to be an accurate assessment

of my capabilities at that time, and now.

| have been based in Glasgow throughout the time | have had roles in the Security

Team.

| recall that | was temporarily promoted to the role of Investigation Manager in

2000 and | recall attended some training at that time.

| recall that when taking up the role of Investigation Manager, | received 4-5
weeks training in the training unit above the Lavender Hill Post Office/Battersea
Delivery Office in London. The training was given by Royal Mail Group accredited
trainers who had experience of Investigations. The training covered the Police
and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 ("PACE") Codes of Practice, Theft Act, carrying
out searches, suspect offender interviews, cognitive witness interviews, taking
witness statements (including the use of the Solicitor and Friends forms), the
Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act, IIMARC (which refers to "information,
intention, method, administration, risk assessment, communications, human
rights and other legal issues") and NPA notifications ("NPA" refers to "non-Police
Agency", and the notifications refer to notifications we made to the police about

the criminal proceedings we undertook). After a few months in my role as an

investigations manager, | went to Rugby to attend further training, including

courtroom training.

| can also recall being given onsite/field training on Scots Law, with the main
difference at the time being that, in Scotland, a suspect was not offered a solicitor

to be present at an interview.

| have also been asked to consider the performance and development review
carried out for the 2013/14 at POL00105145. The document is my performance
review for that year. Each year all managers within POL have to complete a six
month and annual performance and development review ("PDR"). We have to
reflect on what we had done and what we considered we had done well in each

period.

When | took up the role of Investigation Manager, | reported to Judith (Jude)
Trotter, and after she left | reported to Diane Matthews for a temporary period
and then Andrew Daley. Afterwards, my recollection is that | had a series of
managers: Lesley Frankland, followed by Keith Gilchrist, then Kevin Ryan and
Simon Hutchinson (again for a temporary period) and then Helen Dickinson

before she left in around 2019. | am now managed by Simon Talbot.

| have always viewed my colleagues and managers to be competent and

professional.

In outline, | understood the role of Investigation Manager to involve investigating

crime or suspected crime against POL by its staff, agents and their employees.

In my CV at POL00105143 | mentioned the Financial Evaluation form. Following

an interview with a suspect, | was required to complete a Financial Evaluation

Page 6 of 44
19.

20.

21.

WITNO08940100
WITN08940100

Sheet. This detailed the suspect's name, the Post Office branch and what they
had said about the loss; the form also recorded my opinion on the loss and any
financial details given by the suspect, including how they intended to repay any
monies. Although | had to complete the form for Scottish cases, it was recognised
that POL Financial Investigators did not have the authority to conduct a Financial

Investigation in Scotland.

In my CV at POL00105143 | also mentioned case submission timescales. All
cases had to be submitted within appropriate timescales. | can’t fully recall the
timescale, but | believe it may have been 12 days from the interview. | also
mentioned in my CV | was in the process of making up a crib sheet as a reminder

for the timescales, but | can’t recall if | completed this.

In my CV at POL00105143 | also mention the Post Office Risk Assessment
("PORA") form. | was also required to complete and submit a PORA prior to
interviews. | would contact the local police to ask if there were any concerns about
the area to be visited including the area the suspected resided. Warning signs, if
known, were to be captured along with a risk evaluation. This was then submitted

to my Line Manager.

In my performance review for 2013/14, at POL00105145, | refer (at pages 3 and
4) to some work | did to secure specialist legal advice for Scottish casework, when
Scottish cases were submitted to POL Legal Services for review. It was
recognised within POL Legal Services and the Security Team that they weren't
knowledgeable about Scots Law. | was concerned that | wasn’t receiving the
same legal support and | recall that | asked if Scottish solicitors could be sought

to assist and advise on whether there was sufficient evidence to submit a file to

Page 7 of 44

WITNO08940100

COPFS. | was advised to identify a suitable firm, and after researching some
candidates | identified BTO LLP Solicitors. | believed they would be best suited
as they employed a number of former Procurators Fiscal and had an office in
Glasgow. | recall that | informed Jarnail Singh in POL Legal Services and | believe
he contacted them and made arrangements for them to advise me on Scottish

cases.

| dealt with Laura Irvine and Lindsay MacNeill at BTO, though mainly Laura. |
recall that | arranged training for them on Horizon (which | think took place at the
St Vincent Street Crown Office). | also made them aware of the Second Sight
report, | either sent a copy or a link to the report. | mentioned on the document at
POL00105145 that | advised BTO and the COPFS on cases at the time and
archived cases in relation to the Second Sight review and cases where Horizon

issues were raised, but | can’t recall which cases.

In 2013 | also arranged for Laura Irvine and Lindsay MacNeill to provide
Courtroom Awareness training for the auditors in Scotland (the document at
POL00139816 is a copy of the presentation they gave). | and my colleague, Mike

Stanway, Investigation Manager, also gave a presentation.

| also mentioned on the document at POL00105145 that | had reviewed the layout
of the report | submitted to the COPFS to bring it into line with the Police. | exhibit
the amended versions of the forms at POL00118102 and POL00118103 to my

statement as WITN08940101.

| believe that from 2006 all reports all non-Police authorities were required to be
submitted to the COPFS electronically. This was to be through the COPFS

Specialist Reporting Agency (SRA) website. | attended training at the Procurator

Page 8 of 44
WITNO08940100
WITN08940100

Fiscal office in Glasgow. When my colleague Mike Stanway joined the team in
2011, | arranged for him to attend a training session at the same office. Mike was
based in England, but he was partnered with my myself to assist in Scottish

cases.

26. Paragraph 3 of the Request asks me to describe my role in relation to disciplinary
matters, interviewing suspects, disclosure, litigation case strategy and liaising

with other POL departments regarding the progress of cases.

27. Regarding disciplinary matters, the only relevant role that | can recall is that |
would submit a disciplinary report to the relevant Contracts Manager following a

suspect interview, if this was required.

28. Regarding suspect interviews, | both led in interviews and sat in interviews as a

second officer.

29. Regarding disclosure, my role involved disclosing information to solicitors
representing suspects prior to an interview. As part of the prosecution process in
England | would be required to complete the documents of the type at
POL00051526 and POL00051527, and other disclosure forms. These forms are

not required in Scotland.

30. | was not involved in any litigation case strategy.

31. Regarding liaising with other POL departments, in my role | liaised mainly with
Contract Managers, the Former Agent Debt team and Cash Management. | can’t

recall if | liaised with any other departments.

The Security Team’s role in relation to criminal investigations and prosecutions

32. Paragraph 4 of the Request draws my attention to a series of policies and

Page 9 of 44
33.

34.

WITNO08940100
WITN08940100

procedures, and paragraph 5 asks me to explain the organisational structure of
the Security Team, my role in the development and/or management of any of
these policies and procedures and to explain the legislation, policies and/or

guidance that covered the conduct of investigations.

There have been a lot of changes in personnel and teams over the period | have
worked in the Security Team, and the account | have given here is to the best of
my knowledge. When | joined there was a Head of Security and Investigations

who oversaw the following:

33.1. The Investigation Team, with a Head of Investigations whose team dealt

solely with investigations.

33.1. The Security Team, who visited branches to advise on the physical

security (e.g. safes, alarms, screens etc.).

33.2. The Physical Security Team who dealt with updating and the purchase of

new equipment (e.g. safes, alarms, screens etc.).

33.3. The Casework Team, dealing with investigation case files.

In 2008, there was a restructure. The post of Senior Security Manager was
introduced, and they reported to the Head of Security. The Senior Security

Manager oversaw the following:

34.1. The Commercial Team, though | can’t recall their responsibilities.

34.2. The Physical Team, whose role was to visit branches to advise on the

physical security in branches.

34.3. The Risk Team, who | believe dealt with Risk Management issues.

Page 10 of 44
35.

36.

37.

WITNO08940100
WITN08940100

34.4. The Assets Team, whose role was to update and purchase new security

equipment.

34.5. The Fraud Team, who undertook investigations.

34.6. The Casework Team, who were responsible for the administration of

investigation case files.

In 2011 Investigation Managers also took on the role that had been carried out

by the Physical Team, along with their investigations role.

There was a further restructure in 2014/2015. A number of new teams were

created, and the heads of those teams reported to the Head of Security.

36.1. The Financial Crime Team, whose remit included money laundering

reporting and suspicious activity reports.

36.2. The Crime Risk Team, whose remit included risk management and, Crime

Risk models.

36.3. The Physical Security Team, responsible for physical assets (e.g. safes,

alarms, screens etc.).

36.4. The Security Operations Team, responsible for security and investigations.

36.5. The Post Office Security Team and Intel team, who shared the same
personnel and acted as a point of contact for Law Enforcement, dealing

with robbery and burglary reports and ARQ requests.

In 2019 the team was streamlined. The Head of Security post had two direct

reports, as follows:

WITNO08940100
WITN08940100

37.1. The Security Intelligence and Strategy Manager, responsible for the Post

Office Security/Intel team.

37.2. The Security Operations Team Manager, who oversaw the Security

Managers.

Paragraph 6 of the Request asks me to explain my role (if any) in the development
and/or management of any of the policies listed in paragraph 4. To the best of my
recollection, | was not involved in the development and/or management of the of
any of these policies. (I refer later in my statement to the involvement | had in the
development of the Mandatory Losses & Gains Policy for the Crown Office

Network.)

Paragraph 7 of the Request asks me about the legislation, policies and/or
guidance which governed the conduct of investigations by the Security Team

during the period | worked within it and how these changed.

| am aware that there were several policies governing the conduct of
investigations and that these were updated and sent to me over the period |
worked within the Security Team. | would have read these, but | cannot recall the

changes or when the documents were sent to me.

Paragraph 8 of the Request draws my attention to a series of documents and
asks me to describe what, if any, impact there was on the conduct of

investigations as a result of the separation of the Post Office from Royal Mail.

My recollection is that there was no change to the conduct of investigations
following the separation from Royal Mail. If there was a need for a joint

investigation, there was a process to be followed, as set out in the document at

Page 12 of 44
43.

46.

47.

WITNO08940100
WITN08940100

POL00123312 (the Memorandum of Understanding between POL and Royal Mail

on Joint Investigation Protocols).

Paragraph 9 of the Request asks me about the process for dealing with
complaints about the conduct of an investigation by the Security Team. | don’t
recall having a complaint made against my conduct during an investigation by the
Security Team. I’m unaware what the process would have been if a complaint

was made.

Paragraph 10 of the Request asks me what (if any) supervision there was over
criminal investigations conducted by the Security Team. Each month | was sent
a "Cases on Hana" file listing all my cases. | had to provide updates on each

case. If no update could be provided, you had to give a reason why.

Paragraph 11 of the Request asks me how Post Office policy and practice
regarding the investigation and prosecution of Crown Office employees differed
from the policy and practice regarding investigation and prosecution of
subpostmasters ("SPMs"), their managers and assistants and if this changed

during my time in the Security Team. | was aware of no such difference.

Paragraph 12 of the Request asks me to consider the document at POL00129339
(a "Project Initiation Document" for a project called "Security Compliance and
Safety" and dated 27 February 2013) and | am asked about the purpose of the

project outlined in the document and my involvement in the project.

| am named as one of the members of the "Working Group" at section 3 of the
document. The purpose of the project, as | recall, was to maintain the integrity of
the Supply Chain sites and the safety of people and assets. My involvement was

to manage the undertaking of the Operation Stripe Testing and Premises Attack

Page 13 of 44
48.

49.

WITNO08940100
WITN08940100

Plans tests set out in the project for the Security Team North.

Paragraph 13 asks me to consider the email at document at POL00123863 (an
email to me from Sharron Logan, Security Risk Programme Manager, dated 23
February 2016) and the document at POL00088124 (the "Mandatory Losses &
Gains Policy for the Crown Office Network", version 1.0 dated 24 April 2013), and
asks me to describe the circumstances in which | received this email and the

nature of any involvement | had in reviewing this policy.

| led the Directly Managed Branch ("DMB") programme (formerly the Crown
Office programme) around this time. The DMB programme involved each
Security Manager visiting an agreed number of branches in their area during the
financial year, usually at least one per month. They completed an electronic
toolkit and uploaded it to the programme's Sharepoint site. The toolkit covered
topics on cash management, losses and gains, security procedures and physical
security. Having considered the email at POL00123863, | can recall reviewing the
document at POL00088125 (a draft version of the Mandatory Losses & Gains

Policy) and | recall suggesting amendments to it, mainly:

49.1. The reference to "Multiple Stock Units" at section 3, paragraph 5.b. | made
the suggestion that units should be checked every eight weeks, which is
what ended up being written into the final policy (at section 4, paragraph

7b.).

49.2. The reference to "Snap Checks" at section 4, paragraph 7.a. | also made
the suggestion that these should be carried out every eight weeks, which
is what ended up being written into the final policy (at section 5, paragraph

9.a.)

Page 14 of 44
WITNO08940100
WITN08940100

50. | did recommend other amendments, but these did not make it into the final
document POL00088124. | have located a version of the document at
POL00088125 which shows the amendments that | suggested (marked in red)
and which | recall returning to Sharron Logan. | exhibit this document to my

statement as WITN08940102.

Audit and investigation

51. Paragraph 14 of the Request draws my attention to the document at
POL00104821 (“Condensed Guide for Audit Attendance”, version 2 dated
October 2008) and asks me to describe the circumstances in which an
investigator would attend an audit of a branch and what an investigator's role

was.

52. | have reviewed the document and believe that it is a document intended for the
use of auditors, not investigators. The circumstances in which | would attend an
audit of a branch as an investigator would be if the Fraud Analysis team identified
an issue at a branch: for example, excess overnight cash holdings or supressed
banking deposits. | might also be instructed to attend if the audit team on site
identified a large discrepancy. My role on arrival was to discuss with the auditors
their findings and gather any paperwork that would assist with a potential

investigation.

53. Paragraph 15 of the Request asks me about who decided, if a shortfall was
identified, whether an investigation into criminal activity should be conducted or
if the case should be pursued as a debt recovery case, and the triggers/criteria

for raising a fraud case.

54. The decision on whether an investigation would be pursued or not was, | believe,

Page 15 of 44
WITNO08940100
WITN08940100

made by Senior Management or Line Management within the Security Team. |
am not aware of any local contract managers having any input in the decision
making. Over the time | have worked in the Security Team, there were triggers
for raising cases and they changed multiple times over the years. | can’t recall all
the levels at which triggers had been set, but | believe they ranged from £1,000

to £50,000.

The process followed by Security Team investigators when conducting a
criminal investigation following the identification of a shortfall at an audit

55. Paragraph 16 of the Request asks, once a decision had been made to conduct a
criminal investigation, what process the Security Team investigators followed in

conducting their initial investigation.

56. On receipt of the Case Raised form, | would consider the enquiry. If it related to
a Sub Post Office, | would contact POL Human Resources to request the
postmaster’s print-out and P356 assistant list, which included all Horizon User
IDs. If it related to a Crown Office, | would ask for the employee printout. If the
information in the Case Raised form related to an audit shortage, if the
information had not already been provided, | would contact the lead auditor and
request the relevant reports from Horizon, Office Balance, Stock Unit(s)
balance(s) and snapshot(s) for any stock units, Cash Declarations, User IDs and

any relevant forms.

57. Ifasuspect was identified, they would be contacted and invited to interview. They
would be made aware of their right to a solicitor and their right to have a friend to
be present at the interview (we would send the forms POL001(S) "Legal Rights
Scotland" form and POLO03 "Friend" form). Latterly | also told suspects that, if

they were a member of the NFSP, they could contact their local rep for advice.

Page 16 of 44
WITNO08940100
WITN08940100

58. Once an interview had been conducted, the relevant paperwork was completed
(for example the Suspect Offender report and Financial Investigation form) any
further lines of enquiry made, any statements taken, then a report would be

submitted for a decision to be made to prosecute or not.

59. In answering this question, | have considered the documents at POL00031005,
POL00027863 and POL00030902, being the most recent versions of the
“Conduct of Criminal Investigations Policy” (dated 2013, 2014 and 2018
respectively). | note the flowchart set out in the policies, which would have been
the process to follow for a case in England. For Scottish cases, the process in
the flowchart at page 3 of documents POL00031005 and POL00027863 would
have been followed up to “Criminal Law Team to review the case file. Proceed
with case?". | don’t recall Cartwright King being involved in the process for
Scottish cases; | believe they were returned to me with a decision from POL's
Criminal Law team. If the decision was to proceed to prosecution, | would then
submit the file to the COPFS. If the decision was not to proceed, that case would

be closed. This was the process that was in place before we engaged BTO.

Decisions about prosecution and criminal enforcement proceedings

60. Paragraph 17 of the Request asks, once an initial investigation was carried out,
who decided whether a SPM, their manager(s) and / or assistant(s) or a Post
Office employee should be prosecuted and what considerations determined
whether a prosecution was brought; | am also asked about whether this changed

during my time the Security Team.

61. In England and Wales, | believe POL's Criminal/Legal team would be responsible

for the decision on whether a Post Office employee, SPM, their managers or

Page 17 of 44
62.

63.

64.

65.

66.

WITNO08940100
WITN08940100

assistants would be prosecuted by POL. | believe their decision would have been

informed by the evidence detailed in the report.

In Scotland, only COPFS can bring prosecutions. A report would be submitted to

them and, if they were requested, all productions (exhibits) were provided.

Paragraph 18 of the Request asks, if a branch was run by a SPM, whether the
SPM'’s local contract manager had any input into this decision-making process
and if this changed during my time the Security Team. | am not aware of local
Contract Managers having any input to the decision making during my role in the

Security Team.

Paragraph 19 of the Request asks me about the test applied by those making
prosecution and charging decisions and the factors which were considered at the
evidential and the public interest stage. I’m not aware what test was applied in
the decision making or what factors were considered at the evidential and the
public interest stage. | played no role in the decision-making, and would expect

the Criminal Law team to decide in England and the COPFS in Scotland.

Paragraph 20 of the Request asks what legal and other advice was provided to
those making prosecution decisions. | am not aware what advice legal or
otherwise was provided to those making decisions about whether to prosecute

and what charges to bring.

Paragraph 21 of the Request asks in what circumstances steps were to restrain
a suspect's assets by criminal enforcement methods. Following an interview, |
completed a Financial Evaluation Sheet with the financial details provided by the
interviewee. These were submitted with my report. These would be passed to a

Financial Investigator to action if necessary. POL Financial Investigators didn’t

Page 18 of 44
WITNO08940100
WITN08940100

have the authority to restrain a suspect's assets in Scotland. | believe Police
Scotland have Financial Investigators, but I’m not aware of their powers. When |
submitted a case through the COPFS Specialist Reporting Agency website, | was
asked if compensation was sought. This didn’t guarantee compensation would

be granted; that decision was ultimately for the court.

67. Paragraph 22 of the Request asks who decided whether criminal enforcement
proceedings should be pursued and the factors they considered when making
decisions. I'm not aware if it was the Financial Investigators or senior
management who decided if enforcement proceedings should be pursued or the

factors considered.

Training, instructions and guidance to investigators within the Security Team

68. Paragraph 23 of the request asks what instructions, guidance and / or training
were given to investigators within the Security Team on a range of topics and

how was this provided.

69. Regarding training in interviewing suspects, | recall this was covered in my initial
training when | joined the Security Team in 2005. We were taught interview
techniques and how to ask questions. There were role play exercises, with the
trainers taking on the roles of suspects; we were given a scenario and tasked

with interviewing a suspect.

70. Regarding taking witness statements, | recall that this was also covered in my
initial training. We were given scenarios and had to practice taking statements

from the trainers and fellow attendees.

71. Regarding conducting searches, | recall that as part of my initial training that |

WITNO08940100
WITN08940100

have described above, we were taken to a house in the Police College near
London. | assisted in conducting a search, looking for items that had been pre-
placed in the property. We were also trained on how to compete the necessary

forms.

Regarding the investigator's duties in carrying out investigations, | recall during
the initial training that we were taught to ensure all evidence is obtained, lines of
enquiries are completed, mitigating circumstances are considered and
investigated, and interviews are conducted within guidelines. All activities taken

were to be recorded on the Event Log.

Regarding obtaining evidence in the course of an investigation, also during initial
training we were taught that the investigator must obtain all original documents
(for example, in the event of an audit shortage, audit cash sheets, Horizon reports
printed at the time of the audit, Branch Trading Statements and Horizon reports

produced by the branch).

The initial training also taught us about obtaining evidence from third parties who
might hold relevant evidence. For example, banks statements, if it was suspected
a shortfall was due to the monies being deposited into a suspect’s bank account
using Horizon. Also, ARQ requests to Fujitsu in order to obtain Horizon data in
various cases (for example, to investigate deposits into bank accounts in Post
Office Card Account cases involving a vulnerable person duped into making

multiple withdrawals).

Regarding an investigator's disclosure obligations, the initial training taught us
that, in England, it is the duty of the investigator provide a record of all information

obtained and to disclose all relevant information to the prosecution and defence.

Page 20 of 44
76.

77.

78.

WITNO08940100
WITN08940100

| learned on taking up my role in Scotland that it is the duty of the investigator to
do the same as in England, with the exception information is provided to the
COPFS. The COPFS considers whether the information meets the disclosure test
before disclosing the information. | attended some training on disclosure provided
by, and have located a copy of the presentation that was given which | exhibit to

my statement as POL00129134.

Regarding drafting investigation reports, the initial training taught us that the
Offender report must contain a "preamble", for example, in the case of an audit
shortage, the details of the audit, the suspect interview (including evidence put to
the suspect), exhibits/productions, details of witness statements, any
denials/admissions made, any follow up enquiries and a summary of the

evidence.

Paragraph 24 of the Request draws my attention to the document at
POL00121680 (an email from Andrew Daley dated 6 September 2010 that was
sent to me and a number of others, together with its attachments at
POL00104837, POL00104848, POL00064059 and POL00124232) and | am
asked where | was based when | received this email, whether this was the first
time | had been sent these materials and if any presentation about them was

given.

The documents relate to some procedures and standards that had been
developed in relation to committal papers. At the time | received the email at
document POL00121680 | was based in Scotland. | can’t recall exactly when |
received the materials, but it is my belief that this would have been the first

occasion on which | saw them. | can’t recall receiving the presentation that is

Page 21 of 44
79.

80.

81.

82.

83.

WITNO08940100
WITN08940100

referred to in the email.

Paragraph 25 of the Request asks me to consider the document at POL00129144
(an email from Roslyn Simpson dated 5 October 2010 and the attachment at
document POL00129145) and | am asked to explain the circumstances in which
| was due to attend the "Specialist Reporting Agencies — Disclosure Course"
referred to in these documents, whether | attended it and whether | was based in

Scotland at the time.

| believe | was asked to attend the training as | was the investigation manager
covering Scotland (being based in Scotland at that time). | recall that | did attend

on 20 October 2010.

Paragraph 26 of the Request draws my attention to a series of documents relating
to casework management and paragraph 27 asks me a series of questions about

them.

| don’t recall being provided with the 2000 and 2002 versions of the Casework
Management document at POL00104747 and POL00104777 during my time in
the Security Team. | cannot therefore say what | might have understood the
instructions / guidance given in second, third and fourth bullet points on page 2
of the 2000 version and the first, second and third bullet points on page 2 of the
2002 version to mean. Had | considered them at the time, | don’t think | would
have considered them to be relevant to disclosure obligations in relation to
information about Horizon bugs, errors and defects, as | wasn’t aware of any

bugs, errors or defects until | became aware of the Second Sight report.

To the best of my recollection, the compliance checks referred to in David

Posnett's email of 23 May 2011 at POL00118096 had been introduced prior to

Page 22 of 44
WITNO08940100
WITN08940100

2011 to apply a consistent approach in investigations and the submission of the
"green jackets". ("Green jacket" refers to a folder which, on the outside, displays
the case file number, the type of enquiry and the branch name. It also displays
the date you received the file, who you send it to, the date sent etc. The jacket
contains all the forms relevant to the case, information, reports, with Appendix
folders for witness statements (Appendix A), evidence (Appendix B) and
correspondence (Appendix C).) | can’t recall exactly when they were introduced
or if there were any inconsistencies in investigations or green jacket submissions
prior to the compliance checks being introduced. The checks | believe were

conducted by the Casework Managers.

84. | had no role in relation to the development, management or amendment of the

suite of compliance documents attached to David Posnett's email.

85. | have been asked to set out what | understood by paragraph 2.15 of the
document at POL00118101 ("Guide to the Preparation and Layout of
Investigation Red Label Case Files — Offender reports & Discipline reports”), how
this related to the document at POL00118102 (Offender Report template), and
its relevance to the Post Office’s disclosure obligations (and in particular as they

related to information about Horizon bugs, errors and defects).

86. | don’t exactly recall the document at POL00118101, but | do recall that there
were requirements which governed the preparation and layout of case files. My
understanding of paragraph 2.15 of the document at POL00118101 is that any
failures in "security, supervision, procedures and product integrity" identified that

led to a crime being committed were to be included in the Offender report.

87. | have considered the document at POL00118104 (titled “Identification Codes”

Page 23 of 44
WITNO08940100
WITN08940100

and attached to David Posnett’s email of 23 May 2011). | don't recall ever having
seen this document. | do not know who drafted the document. | find the
descriptions attached to the codes to be disgusting and racist. As to why Security
Team investigators were instructed to assign identification codes to suspected
offenders, my understanding is that identification codes were already in place
when | started as an investigation manager. | took them as being a standard entry
of the Offender and Discipline reports. | have some recollection that | had a file,
possibly an Excel file, which described IC codes 1 to 4, but | cannot now locate
this. | do know that it didn’t resemble the document at POL00118104. In my
experience, the only codes | recall every having to use regularly were IC1 and

IC4.

Analysing Horizon data, requesting ARQ data from Fujitsu and relationship with
Fujitsu

88. Paragraph 28 of the Request asks what analysis (if any) was done by Security
Team investigators of Horizon data when a SPM / SPM’s manager(s) or
assistant(s) / Crown Office employee(s) attributed a shortfall to problems with
Horizon. If a shortfall was claimed to be attributed to Horizon, | cannot recall if
data and a statement was requested from Fujitsu or only a statement. | didn’t

carry out analysis on the Horizon system, this was conducted by Fujitsu.

89. Paragraph 29 of the Request asks ARQ data requested from Fujitsu as a matter
of course when a shortfall had been identified and the relevant SPM / SPM’s
manager(s) or assistant(s) / Crown Office employee(s) attributed the shortfall to
problems with Horizon. ARQ data was not requested from Fujitsu as a matter of

course. It would only have been requested if it was relevant to an enquiry.

90. Paragraph 30 of the Request asks whether ARQ data, when it was obtained from

Page 24 of 44
91.

92.

93.

WITNO08940100
WITN08940100

Fujitsu, was provided to the SPM in question as a matter of course. | don’t recall

the data ever being provided to the SPM.

Paragraph 31 of the Request asks me to consider the documents at
FUJ00225725 (email correspondence between July and September 2010
relating to a request | made for ARQ data for Bridgeton Post Office) and
FUJ00226055 (emails between Cartwright King solicitors and Gareth Jenkins of
Fujitsu, 28 November 2012) and | am asked to describe the circumstances in
which | would have contact with Fujitsu when | worked within the Security Team

and the relevant contacts at Fujitsu.

Initial contact with Fujitsu was made through our Security Team. On reviewing
the document at FUJ00225725 | can see that my initial request was made to
"Post Office Security". | was not in direct contact with either Penny Thomas or
Gareth Jenkins. | would only contact Fujitsu if it was specifically required for case.
The documents at FUJ00156984, FUJ00156985, FUJ00156994, FUJ00156998
and FUJ00157004 show some emails that | exchanged with Andy Dunks, who
worked in Security Operations within Fujitsu, during 2017-2018. | contacted Andy
Dunks directly as | had been copied in on correspondence with him and therefore

had his contact details.

Paragraph 32 of the Request asks what role | understood Gareth Jenkins to have
relation to the criminal prosecutions he was involved in. | recall Gareth Jenkins’
name, and note that he was sent an email in November 2012 (document
FUJ00226055) which refers to him providing a report in a case in 2012 in which
| was to be a witness. Other than that | don’t recall any involvement he had in

relation to criminal prosecutions.

Page 25 of 44
WITNO08940100
WITN08940100

94. Paragraph 33 of the Request asks me to what extent did | considered Gareth
Jenkins to be acting as an expert witness, my understanding of the rules
governing independent expert evidence and who provided advice or assistance
to me in this in this regard. Other than what | described in paragraph 93 above, |
don't recall Gareth Jenkins’ involvement in relation to criminal prosecutions. Other
than those cases where Fujitsu staff were asked to provide witness statements,

| don’t recall having to request an expert witness in any of my cases.

Relationship with others

95. Paragraph 34 of the Request asks me to describe my involvement with Cartwright
King Solicitors, including the level of interaction that | typically had in a case (and
the roles | had) and my contacts. Personally, | had very little interaction with
Cartwright King Solicitors, as my involvement was mainly with Scottish cases. |
do remember a meeting with Cartwright King Solicitors regarding the case
mentioned in the document at FUJ00226055. As | recall, the case related to a
shortage at Winlaton Post Office, in north-east England, and | was the lead
investigator. | recall that the meeting was with Rachel Panter and another person
who may have been Martin Smith. | can’t recall the details of the meeting or what

was discussed.

Involvement in the Criminal Case Studies

Prosecution of Peter Holmes

96. Paragraph 35 of the Request asks me to provide a full account of my involvement
in and my recollection of the criminal prosecution of Peter Holmes and | am asked

to consider the documents referred to in Paragraph 36.

97. Paragraph 37 of the Request asks me how and when | first become involved in

Page 26 of 44
98.

99.

100.

101.

WITNO08940100
WITN08940100

this case. | can’t recall exactly how | first became involved, but | expect | would
have been contacted by my Line Manager at the time and informed that | would

be leading the case, with Chris Knight as the second officer.

Paragraph 38 of the Request asks me if | was aware of any allegations made by
Peter Holmes relating to the reliability of the Horizon IT system and, if so, what |
thought the significance of this was. Mr Holmes indicated during interview that
the loss may be down to the Horizon system. At the time, | don't believe | would
have been aware of the significance of this, as | don’t recall being aware of any
issues with Horizon at the time. Mr Holmes said he couldn't explain the losses,

and didn’t believe anyone else in the office had stolen any money.

Paragraph 39 of the Request asks me about my role in relation to the audit of
Jesmond Branch undertaken on 18 September 2008. | was not involved in the
decision to conduct an audit at Jesmond Post Office and | don’t recall why the
audit was undertaken. | believe | was emailed the audit report on 18 September
2008; | believe this to be the case because | would have had to have had the
report before | travelled down to Newcastle on 19 September. It would have been

provided by Mike Webb, Lead Auditor, or the Casework team.

Paragraph 40 of the Request asks me to explain how the search at Jesmond Post
Office was conducted and my role, if any, in that search. | can’t now recall

conducting a search at Jesmond Post Office.

Paragraph 41 of the Request asks me about the decision to search Mr Holmes’
home on 19 September 2008 and the conduct of the search. The decision to carry
out a search followed POL policy: we were instructed to conduct searches to

preserve any evidence. | can’t recall how we conducted the search, but looking

Page 27 of 44
WITNO08940100
WITN08940100

at the document at POL00060805, | can see that | was accompanied by Chris
Knight and Mark Haddrell. We would have searched one room at a time, with Mr
Holmes being present. Looking at page 7 of the document at POL00060805, |
can see that | recorded the first item, found by myself. After this, | can see that all
other items found were recorded against Chris Knight and Mark Haddrell, which

suggests they continued the search.

102. Paragraph 42 of the Request asks me whose decision was it to interview Mr
Holmes. Again, decision the decision to interview Mr Holmes followed policy. As

an investigator, | was expected to interview a suspect as part of an enquiry.

103. Paragraph 43 of the Request asks what my view was of Mr Holmes’ assertion in
his interview (at page 8 of the document at POL00050208) that the only way he
could explain the losses were “it’s the Horizon that’s let us down”. My view was
that Mr Holmes’ assertion needed following up. | can see that there was a request
made for the ARQ data (as | discuss elsewhere in my statement) but | can't recall
if a request for a witness statement from Fujitsu was made. | can’t remember now

what my view would have been about Mr Holmes’ assertion about Horizon.

104. Paragraph 44 of the Request asks me to consider my investigation reports at
documents POL00050334 and POLO0050832. In particular, my report at
POL00050334 refers to a request being made to ascertain whether Horizon
equipment at the Jesmond Branch was faulty. | note that at POL00050832, at
page 7, my report says that checks had revealed no problems with Horizon. |
cannot recall what checks were carried out in relation to Horizon at the branch,
who carried out the checks or what the results where. I’ve considered all the

documents and can’t find anything in relation to the request or the results of the

Page 28 of 44
WITNO08940100
WITN08940100

checks.

105. Paragraph 45 of the Request asks me to consider the document at POL00050255
(the Suspect Offender Reporting form) which advises that Mr Holmes was
suspended on the authority of Brian Trotter, and asks what input, if any, | had in

the decision. | had no input into the decision to suspend Mr Holmes.

106. Paragraph 46 of the Request has asked me to consider the witness statements
of Thelma Crerand (Assistant Manager, Jesmond Post Office) (POL00047293),
Vicky Mitchell (Post Office Assistance, Jesmond Post Office) (POL00047294),
Doreen Corcoran (Counter Clerk, Jesmond Post Office) (POLO0051515) and
Jenera Begum (Counter Clerk, Jesmond Post Office) (POL00043887) and about
my role in relation to obtaining these statements. | can’t recall who decided that
each of the individuals should provide a witness statement or at what stage in the

investigation was it decided that they should provide witness statements.

107. My role in taking witness statements involved asking each of the witnesses
questions, and | captured their answers/comments on the statement. | don't recall
giving the witnesses any information prior to them giving their statements, in this
case or indeed in any other case. | asked all the witnesses if they were aware of

any problems with Horizon and all said they weren't aware of any problems.

108. Paragraph 47 of the Request asks me to consider the financial evaluation sheet
completed for Mr Holmes at document POL00043951, the enquiries made to
Barclays bank at document POL00050821, the results of those enquiries at
document POL00060806 and the witness statement of Sunil Khanna in relation
to the salary paid to Mr Holmes, at document UKG100014640, and asks me about

the investigation into Mr Holmes' finances.

Page 29 of 44
WITNO08940100
WITN08940100

109. | can’t recall what the investigation into Mr Holmes’ personal finances revealed. |
recall that | did obtain the statement from Sunil Khanna in relation to Mr Holmes’s
wages. | can’t recall the investigation or who | would have reported the results of
those investigations to. I’m not aware if the outcome of those investigations
factored into the decision whether there was sufficient evidence to charge Mr

Holmes.

110. Paragraph 48 of the Request refers me to the documents at POL00043951 (the
Financial Evaluation Sheet completed in this case) and POL00051984 (witness
statement of Laura Currie of the Alliance and Leicester dated 26 August 2009)
and asked me about the investigations into the finances of Mr Holmes’ wife’s
business. The only bank statement that | can recall obtaining related to Mr and
Mrs Holmes' joint account, | don't recall obtain statements relating to her business

account.

111. Paragraph 49 of the Request asks me to explain any further sources of
information | considered during the investigation. | can’t recall if any other sources

of information were considered during the investigation.

112. Paragraph 50 of the Request asks if any Horizon data (and in particular ARQ
logs) requested from Fujitsu in this case. | note that on page 2 of my investigation
report dated 6 October 2008 (POL00050334) | said that "Horizon data has been
requested". | do not believe | would have said this if it hadn’t been requested.
Similarly, page 6 of my investigation report dated 30 January 2009
(POL00050832) refers to Horizon data having been "received and analysed".
Again, | do not believe | would have said this if this hadn't been done. | note the

Court of Appeal's judgment in Josephine Hamilton & Others v Post Office Limited

Page 30 of 44
WITNO08940100
WITN08940100

(POL00113278) which advised (at paragraph 229) that ARQ data was obtained

but that it was not clear if it was disclosed.

113. Paragraph 51 of the Request asks if | obtained legal advice at any stage of the
investigation. Having considered various documents referred to in the Request, |
can see that | corresponded with Juliet McFarlane, Principal Lawyer in the POL
Criminal Law Division, at various stages of the case. This would have been to
inform her of progress, seek advice on the next steps and discuss the expert

accountant's report.

114. Paragraph 52 of the Request asks what role, if any, | played in the decision to
prosecute Mr Holmes and refers to the documents at POL00050865 (memo from
Terry Crowther, Fraud Team, dated 4 February 2009) and POL00050912 (memo

from Juliet McFarlane, dated 16 February 2009).

115. | have also reviewed the reports | made at documents POL00050334 and
POL00050832. In both reports | said that | saw no reason why POL should not
proceed with prosecution. This was my view based on the evidence gathered.
The decision was not ultimately mine to take. The file would be submitted to the
DAM (I think this stood for "Decision Authority Manager") to decide whether POL
should proceed to prosecute or not. The file was then sent to Legal Services for

a legal/final decision.

116. Paragraph 53 of the Request refers me to the documents at POL00066227 (Juliet
McFarlane's attendance note of her call with me on 10 November 2009) and
POL00043846 (the Schedule of Charges) and asks what role, if any, | played in
deciding on and/or drafting the charge faced by Mr Holmes. | would have played

no part in drafting the charge faced by Mr Holmes at document at POL00043846.

Page 31 of 44
WITNO08940100
WITN08940100

| don’t recall the actual conversation | had with Juliet McFarlane and recorded in
the document at POLO00066227 and whether it came before or after the drafted

charge.

117. Paragraph 54 of the Request asks me who was the disclosure officer in this case
and paragraph 55 asks me to explain my role in relation to disclosure. As the lead
investigator | would have been the disclosure officer. My role would have been to
ensure all appropriate material used and unused was disclosed to the prosecution

and defence.

118. Paragraph 56 of the Request asks me what role | played in preparing for the
prosecution and refers to the documents at POL00050940 and POL00050978
(letters | sent to Gosforth Magistrates Court in February and March 2009),
POL00051080 (a memo | sent to Juliet McFarlane on 9 March 2009),
POL00051205 (a memo Juliet McFarlane sent to the Fraud Team, and copied to
me, on 18 March 2009) and POL00066225 (Juliet McFarlane's attendance note

of her call with me on 13 August 2009).

119. My letters to the Magistrates Court were in connection with arranging a court date.
| obtained a summons and sent it to Mr Holmes. | then informed Juliet McFarlane
that the summons had been served by Royal Mail Special Delivery. Juliet
McFarlane then informed me of the prosecuting agent on behalf of POL.
Document POL00066225 states | held a discussion with Legal Services
regarding Mr Khanna’s statement and the documents mentioned in his statement.
| can’t recall the details of the conversation. | would also have prepared the
committal bundle, but as | was not so experienced in dealing with cases in the

English courts, | recall that | was provided with assistance to do this.

Page 32 of 44
WITNO08940100
WITN08940100

120. Paragraph 57 of the Request asks me to consider the documents at
POL00052028 and POL00052037 (emails referencing a request | made for the
Event Logs for Jesmond Post Office in July 2009) and asks me to describe the
disclosure requests made by the defence and how these were responded to. The
request | made was, | believe, for the alarm logs for Jesmond Post Office. These

would have been disclosed to the defence.

121. Paragraph 58 of the Request asks what, if any, further enquiries | conducted after
receiving the defence expert report and about my response to the report. | recall
receiving the expert accountant’s report (at document POL00052103). | cannot
recall conducting further enquiries or what my response to the report, but having
considered document UKGI00014638 (an email | sent to Juliet McFarlane on 19
August 2009), | can see | that | was of the opinion that, without seeing the
business’ daily takings for the period in question, | couldn’t agree with the expert

accountant’s conclusions.

122. Paragraph 59 of the Request asks me to consider Mr Holmes’ defence statement,
dated 30 July 2009 (at document POL00052178 and POL00052193) and asks
me about my observations of the statement and my role in addressing the matters
raised in it. In particular, it asks me how | responded to Mr Holmes' statement that
“| do not believe that Royal Mail has conducted a thorough investigation and did

not consider any alternative in relation to the allegation”.

123. | do not recall receiving the defence statement but accept | would have received
it, as | am copied into the memo dated 5 August 2009 at POL00052193. | don't

recall what view, if any, | had about the contents of the defence statement.

124. Paragraph 60 of the Request asks me to consider the defence representations,

Page 33 of 44
WITNO08940100
WITN08940100

dated 24 August 2009 (at POLO0052389) which were copied to me on 4
September 2009 (under cover of the document at POL00052391) and asks me
about my views on the representations and on the defence accountant’s findings.
| don’t recall receiving the defence representations. | note at document
POL00053521 that the daily takings records were obtained, but | don’t recall

viewing these.

125. Paragraph 61 of the Request refers to the document at POL00060822 (Juliet
McFarlane's memo of 25 September 2009 recording that the Crown rejected the
basis of plea of false accounting but not theft) and asks what role | had in deciding
to reject the basis of plea. | don’t recall having any input into the decision to reject
the basis of plea, or being aware of the rationale on which the decision was

based.

126. Paragraph 62 of the Request asks me to consider the further defence
representations dated 16 November 2009, at document POL00053521 and
copied to me on 24 November 2009 (under cover of the document at
POL00053598) and asks me about my response to these representations,
whether a conference with counsel was arranged and my role in that conference.
| can’t recall responding to the representations or if a conference with counsel

was arranged.

127. Paragraph 63 of the Request refers to the document at POL00053795
referencing that Mr Holmes pleaded guilty to a revised indictment on 22
December 2009, and asks what my views were about this at the time. | don’t

recall having any views on this at the time.

128. Paragraph 64 of the Request refers to the document at POL00054149 (a memo

Page 34 of 44
WITNO08940100
WITN08940100

dated 17 February 2010 recording the sentence imposed on Mr Holmes) and

asks me what my response was. | don’t believe | made a response at the time.

129. Paragraph 65 of the Request refers to the documents at POL00054544 and
POL00054543 (containing emails exchanged in March 2010 regarding
enforcement proceedings) and POL00054790 (the Case Closure Reporting form
| sent on 23 May 2010) and asks me what criminal enforcement proceedings
were taken against Mr Holmes and about my involvement in these proceedings.
| believe consideration was given to recovering the money from Mr Holmes,
initially, but page 3 of the document at POL00054543 shows that POL resolved
to seek recovery from the SPM. My only involvement was to forward a debarment
notice regarding Mr Holmes, as | mention on the Case Closure Reporting form at

POL00054790.

130. Paragraph 66 of the Request asks me to describe any further involvement | had
in this case. Other than what | have described elsewhere in this statement, | don’t

recall any further involvement in the case.

131. Paragraph 67 asks me what my reflections are now on the way the investigation
and prosecution of Mr Holmes was conducted by the Post Office and the outcome
of the case, and my attention is drawn to the judgment of the Court of Appeal in

Josephine Hamilton & Others v Post Office Limited at document POL00113278.

132. | have considered the Court of Appeal judgment, and in particular paragraphs
226 to 230 relating to Mr Holmes. | noted the finding at paragraph 229 that ARQ
data was obtained but that it was not clear if it was disclosed. | acknowledge that
ARQ data was obtained, but cannot recall whether or not it was disclosed. If it

was not disclosed, | cannot now offer a reason why that was.

Prosecutions in the Devolved Nations

133. Paragraph 68 of the Request draws my attention to a series of documents and
paragraph 69 asks me to describe how | became involved in the investigation and
prosecution of cases in the devolved nations, particularly Scotland. | was

recruited to the Security Team to work in Scotland as | based in Glasgow.

134. Paragraph 70 of the Request asked about my experience of the Scottish legal
system before | became involved in this work. | had no experience of the Scottish

Legal system prior to my role as a Security Manager.

135. Paragraph 71 of the Request asks me to describe the process by which cases
were investigated and prosecuted in Scotland, how the process in Scotland
differed from England and Wales and any ways in which the process in Scotland

changed during the time | was involved.

136. The conduct of investigations in Scotland was similar to England and Wales, the
key difference was in the prosecution of cases. As | have described elsewhere in
this statement, the prosecuting authority in Scotland is the COPFS. All cases,
whether they be Police or non-Police cases, have to be submitted to the COPFS,
who then decide whether to proceed to prosecution or not. In around 2006, it
became a requirement that non-Police authorities had to report cases through
the COPFS Specialist Reporting Agency website. On inputting a case, you had

to input a charge to proceed to submission.

137. The process also differed in that in Scotland corroboration of evidence is required;
you need to have two separate sources of evidence. For example, if a person
transacts a deposit into their bank account using Horizon without putting the

money in the drawer, the two sources of evidence could be drawn from the

Page 36 of 44
WITNO08940100
WITN08940100

Horizon data, bank statements, CCTV, or witness evidence.

138. Another difference was that prior to 2010, a suspect didn’t have a right to a
solicitor. This changed in 2010 with the Supreme Court decision in Cadder v HM
Advocate. From 2010, anyone being interviewed under caution had to be offered
a solicitor to be present. The email exchanges documented at POL00121659 are
referring to the procedural changes which would be required following this

decision.

139. Another difference is that, in England, we are only required to summarise the tape
transcripts from an interview, while in Scotland we are required to type out the full

tape transcripts from an interview.

140. Paragraph 72 of the Request asks me to provide details of the individuals |
worked with on cases in Scotland. Those that | can recall were Raymond Grant
and Shirley Stockdale, who were based in Scotland along with Judith Trotter,
Tony Robertson, Diane Matthews, Steve Bradshaw, Mike Stanway, Andrew

Wise, Kevin Ryan and Suzanne Winter.

141. Paragraph 73 of the Request asks me to describe any difficulties | encountered

while working on cases in Scotland. | can’t recall any particular difficulties.

142. Paragraph 74 of the Request refers me to the email chain dated 12 August 2013
at document POL00139853 and asks me to explain the circumstances in which |
was approached by the Crown for comment on prosecution cases; about any
discussions | had with John Scott, Jarnail Singh or any other individual in the Post
Office about this request; and who made the decision that | would not provide a

statement and the reasons for this decision.

Page 37 of 44
WITNO08940100
WITN08940100

143. | can’t recall the circumstances in which | was approached by the Crown or any
discussions with John Scott or Jarnail Singh. It may be that the only contact | had
with John Scott or Jarnail Singh was by email, but | can't now be certain about
that. It seems to me likely that the decision that | would not provide a statement
would have been one for John Scott and/or Jarnail Singh, and | suspect the
reason for the decision was possibly that | was not qualified (legally or otherwise)

to provide such a statement, but | can't be certain about this.

General

144. Paragraph 75 of the Request refers me to the documents at POL00124103 and
POL00124105 (email correspondence in December 2017 referring to the
outcome of a meeting about prosecution) and asked me to describe the
circumstances in which | received the email and my understanding of the
approach of the Post Office to “testing a case in the criminal court prior to the civil
hearing”. | can’t recall the exact circumstances in which | received the email, |
expect it was sent in order to update the Security Team on the business’ position
on prosecutions. | vaguely recall discussions on a test case but not the reasons

behind it.

145. Paragraph 76 of the Request asked me to what extent (if any) | considered a
challenge to the integrity of Horizon in one case to be relevant to other ongoing
or future cases. | didn’t consider any challenge to any one case being relevant to
other ongoing cases or future cases. | recall that when | attended team meetings,
the updates we were given were that a Subject Matter Expert would be coming

“on board” and that the Horizon system was robust with no integrity issues.

146. There are no other matters that | consider are of relevance to the Inquiry's terms

Page 38 of 44
WITNO08940100
WITN08940100

of reference that | would like to draw to the attention of the Chair.

Statement of Truth

| believe the content of this statement to be true.
