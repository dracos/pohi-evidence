PERSONAL NOT FOR ONWARD CIRCULATION
Paula,

Following our meeting with you yesterday I attach a short note summarising the options to go forward together with my
assessment of pros and cons. Chris has cleared (save the pros and cons which were added in response to Martin’s
comments).

Separately there is the issue about whether we should engage Grant Thornton separately to provide QA regardless of
the outcome of Plan A. We can pick this up in any initial discussions.

Ihave also attached the note you asked for of forthcoming issues/events. In particular it would be very helpful to get
your comments on the Arbuthnot meeting note and on the green light to hold introductory discussions with Grant
Thornton etc.

Actions from yesterday’s meeting

1. PV to speak to Alastair re his availability to act as a non executive point of contact for Tony Hooper.

2. Following the outcome of action 1 Chris Aujard to speak to Tony.

3. Board paper to be provided on Second Sight contingencies and management following their refusal to agree to
the Board's requirement around acting against Post Office for their engagement letter.

4. David to review the draft note of the Arbuthnot meeting to ensure it reflects the point Paula made to
James about MPs cases being subsummed into the scheme.

5. David to contact James Arbuthnot’s office once I have your comments (Paula) to agree a note of the meeting — it
would be good to get these soon to avoid James’ office doing any further communicating with MPs without Post
Office input.

e Seperately Chris Aujard to confirm that the issue around scratchcards has been successfully resolved.
Thanks

David
