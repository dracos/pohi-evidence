1. Overview

1.1. Introduction

Post Office is committed to conducting business with the highest standards of honesty,
integrity and openness. Colleagues must be able to raise concerns in confidence, secure
in the knowledge that we will take those concerns seriously and act on them.

This is particularly the case where colleagues are aware of, or suspect, wrongdoing which
affects others (e.g. customers, colleagues, members of the public, or Post Office).

A culture of openness and accountability is essential in order to prevent such situations
occurring and to address them when they do occur. Any suspected wrongdoing should
therefore be reported as soon as possible.

1.2. What is Whistleblowing?

"Whistleblowing" refers to the act of exposing potential or actual wrongdoing and/or
dangerous practices by reporting it either internally within an organisation, or externally,
for example to a regulator.

Individuals should raise a concern if they are aware of, or suspect, wrongdoing which
affects others (e.g. customers, members of the public, colleagues or the Post Office). Some
examples (this is a non-exhaustive list) of situations where an individual may raise a
concern are:

« Financial Crime including Fraud, Money Laundering and financing of terrorism,
Giving, offering or taking of bribes,
Financial mismanagement,
Misreporting,
Practices that could put individuals or the environment at risk,
Breach of Post Office internal policies and procedures (including the Code of
Business Standards),
Concerns about slavery or human trafficking, and
e Any conduct likely to damage Post Office’s reputation.

1.3. Protecting the Whistleblower?

Post Office has a statutory obligation to protect whistleblowers and will support any
individual who raises genuine concerns under this Policy, even if they turn out to be
mistaken. Within Post Office, whistleblowers protected by law include:

* an employee, such as back office, Directly Managed Branch employees

e a trainee, such as a graduate employed by Post Office

* an agency worker

In order to encourage reporting of wrongdoing, Post Office will seek to provide equivalent
protection to Postmasters, Agent Assistants, and Members of the public.

Post Office are committed to respecting the confidentiality of all whistleblowers, and
including those who wish to remain anonymous. There is no requirement for a
whistleblower to provide personal contact information. However, not providing this
information may reduce Post Office’s ability to undertake a thorough investigation into the
concerns raised.

1.4. Whistleblowing Policy

The Whistleblowing policy is part of the Post Office Ltd Key Policies and can be located on
the intranet. The policy has been established to set the minimum operating standards
relating to the management of Whistleblowing throughout the Post Office. It is one of a
set of policies which provide a clear risk and governance framework and an effective
system of internal control for the management of risk across the business. Compliance
with these key policies supports the Post Office in meeting its business objectives and to
balance the needs of shareholders, employees and other stakeholders.

The Whistleblowing Policy is owned by the Whistleblowing Officer, however, the Financial
Crime Team are responsible for maintaining and ensuring the policy is up-to-date. The
policy is updated annually in July and is then presented for approval at July the Risk and
Compliance Committee (RCC) and the Audit, Risk and Compliance Committee (ARC). The
Whistleblowing policy may be updated sooner if there are changes in legislation or a
significant incident.

The following diagram shows the high level journey of the policy update (dates could change).

2. Reporting Channels

2.1. How is Whistleblowing reported?
There are three ways in which colleagues can report a concern:

It is also possible for individuals to make whistleblowing reports via other communications
methods into different parts of the business, i.e. Customer complaints, calls to NBSC and
Grapevine. These may be verbal or written communications, and may often be in the form
of a complaint. Further guidance has been provided to these teams which instructs them
to redirect all potential whistleblowing reports to the Whistleblowing mailbox.

mistaken. Individuals will not be treated unfairly or liable to disciplinary action as a result
of doing so. These protections are set out in our Whistleblowing Policy.

2.4. Whistleblowing Mailbox

The Whistleblowing Mailbox ([ HYPERLINK "mailt isa
point of contact for all whistleblowers and internal stakeholders such as investigating
managers. The mailbox should be monitored daily to ensure all emails are actioned in a
timely manner. The following are some best practices when managing this mailbox:

e All emails are worked within 24 hours of receipt, including new reports (refer to
Section 3 Whistleblowing Reports).

e All emails sent from this mailbox will be automatically saved to your personal sent
items. You should manually move these emails to the ‘Whistleblowing Sent Items’
Folder to ensure other users can have sight of it, if needed.

« All emails relating to active cases or are still being worked should remain in the
Inbox. Once the case is closed/email worked then it should be moved to the ‘Closed
Case Folder’.

The mailbox access is restricted and access request must be made through the Service
Now, accessed via the intranet. All new requests (and deletions) must be approved by the
Whistleblowing Officer.

2.5. Front line teams

Due to the nature of our branch network, Post Office recognises that in some cases
Postmasters, Agent Assistants and members of the public may be best placed to identify
wrongdoing. Whistleblowing is normally reported to the Whistleblowing Officer, either
directly or via the “Speak Up” Line. However, whistleblowing can be reported via other
communication methods into different parts of the business. These teams are:

Customer complaints

Network Branch Support Centre (NBSC)
Executive Correspondence Team (ECT)
Grapevine

These may be verbal or written communications. A process has been established that
these teams escalate all Whistleblowing reports directly to the Whistleblowing Officer (via
the mailbox) to manage. Appendix A is the previous guidance supplied to the teams in
2018.

relation to the report should be stored here, this includes the following (but not limited
to):

- The original report (Email, scanned copy or downloaded Expolink report)

- Email/documentary exchanges with relevant parties

- Any evidence obtained

- Details of case outcome

3.3. Assigning Reports

Upon review of each new report it should be determined the most appropriate person
within the business to address the concerns raised. When deciding the following factors
should be taken into consideration:
- What is the report about?
- Who is it about? i.e. Direct employee or Agent Assistant
- Is more information needed before making a decision?
- Which business area does this affect?
- Which business area is in a better position to conduct a thorough impartial
investigation?
- Are there any potential conflict of interest with the person you intend to assign it
to? i.e. Are they close friends with the individual
- Should the report be investigated internally or externally?

3.3.1. Assigning reports internally

Once the appropriate business unit has been identified, then the report should be assigned
to the relevant Group Executive (GE). In most cases, the GE member will then appoint the
relevant person within their area to conduct the investigation.

Debbie Smith O Rob Houghton ff Mo Kang
Financial ‘GmierOperating Omcer ff Group 1m Director

Over time it has been established reports of a certain nature are not assigned to a GE
member but to an appropriate Senior Manager, these are:
- Reports of fraud/theft within the branch network are assigned to Mark Raymond,
Head of Security.
- Reports of Postmaster contractual breaches are assigned to John Breeden, Head of
Agency Contracts Deployment.
- Reports of Bullying & Harassment are assigned to Lee Kelly, Employee Relations
and Policy Director.

3.3.2. Assigning reports externally

On occasion, reports may involve an individual not employed by Post Office and/or an
external party would be in the best position to investigate the matter. Examples of these
are as follows;

7. Appendix

7.1. Appendix A

Whistleblowing

Whistleblowing is the reporting of potential or actual wrongdoing, and there is a legal obligation for
Post Office to address the concerns and to protect whistleblowers. Due to the nature of our branch
network, Post Office recognises that in some cases Postmasters, Agent Assistants and members of the
public may be best placed to identify wrongdoing

Whistleblowing is normally reported to the Whistleblowing Officer, either directly or via the “Speak
Up” Line. However, whistleblowing can be reported via other communication methods into different
parts of the business, i.e. Customer complaints, calls to NBSC and Grapevine. These may be verbal or
written communications. This guidance is designed to provide further understanding to front line
teams and help differentiate between complaints and whistleblowing, and ensure that any potential
whistleblowing reports are correctly communicated to the Whistleblowing Officer.

What is whistleblowing?

"Whistleblowing" refers to the act of exposing potential or actual wrongdoing and/or dangerous
practices by reporting it either internally within an organisation, or externally, for example to a
regulator.

Individuals should raise a concern if they are aware of, or suspect, wrongdoing which affects others
(e.g. customers, members of the public, colleagues or the Post Office). Some examples (this is a non-
exhaustive list) of situations where an individual may raise a concern are:

© Financial Crime including Fraud, Money Laundering and financing of terrorism,

* Giving, offering or taking of bribes,

¢ Financial mismanagement,

*  Misreporting,

* Practices that could put individuals or the environment at risk,

* Breach of Post Office internal policies and procedures (including the Code of Business

Standards),
* Concerns about slavery or human trafficking, and
«Any conduct likely to damage Post Office’s reputation.

Who is protected by law

Certain protections are provided for whistleblowers by law. Within Post Office this includes:
* an employee, such as back office, Directly Managed Branch employees
* atrainee, such as a graduate employed by Post Office
* an agency worker

In order to encourage reporting of wrongdoing, Post Office will seek to provide equivalent
protection to Postmasters, Agent Assistants, and Members of the public.

What a whistleblower should expect?

A whistleblower has the right to raise their concerns anonymously, if they wish to do so.
However, not providing details may reduce Post Office’s ability to undertake a thorough
investigation into the concerns raised.

Even if details are provided, a whistleblower can still ask to remain anonymous. Post Office
Ltd has a legal obligation to make every effort to protect the individual’s identity.

Post Office Ltd is required to listen to all concerns raised and decide on the necessary actions.
Post Office Ltd can keep the whistleblower informed about the actions taken, but can limit this
information in order to keep the confidence of other people.

How to raise a concern

There are a number of options for colleagues to report wrongdoing. In the first instance,
individuals should raise their concerns with their line manager or with a senior HR manager.
Additionally, colleagues can contact:

¢ The Whistleblowing Officer — Thi:
MacLeod who can be contacted on:
“mailtof
* The “Speak Up” Line — this service is available on}
on-line web portal [ HYPERLINK "http://www.intouchfeedback.com/postoffice" ].

General Counsel, currently Jane
or [ HYPERLINK

“lor via a secure

Post Office also monitors other communication channels such as the Executive
Correspondence Team and Grapevine.

All whistleblowing cases should be treated as highly sensitive and only discussed with the
Whistleblowing Officer and those working with the Officer to address the concerns.

What to do

All whistleblowing reports should be passed to the Whistleblowing Officer, preferably via email.
The Whistleblowing Officer will carry out an initial assessment of the issue to determine the
scope of any investigation.

The Whistleblowing Officer will decide whether an investigation is appropriate and what form
the investigation should take. The type of investigation will depend on the nature of the
concern and may be:

¢ investigated internally

* resolved by agreed action as determined by the Whistleblowing Officer without an

investigation
° referred to the police
* referred to a regulatory authority

If you are unsure as to whether a report is classified as whistleblowing, then you should refer
to one of the following.
* The Whistleblowing Policy
¢ Your line Manager
¢ Whistleblowing Officer i
* or the Financial Crime Team ([ HYPERLINK "mailto;
)

When is it whistleblowing?

Sometimes an individual believes they are blowing the whistle when, in fact, their complaint is
a personal grievance. Individuals who make a disclosure under an organisation’s
whistleblowing policy should believe that they are acting in the public interest. This means in
particular that personal grievances and complaints are not usually covered by whistleblowing
law.

Note: Personal grievances (i.e. bullying, harassment, discrimination) aren’t covered by
whistleblowing law, unless your particular case is in the public interest.

The following table demonstrates various scenarios, and whether or not it would be considered

as whistleblowing.

Whistleblowing

Not Whistleblowing

An Assistant has seen the Postmaster
process card payments with someone else’s
card and with no customer present.

An assistant has suspicions of a customer
coming in to purchase large amounts of
foreign currency on a regular basis.

A clerk has been selling Bureau de Change
and taking a card payment. Then the
customer gives the clerk cash as a personal
payment for processing their transaction.

A clerk makes a mistake when processing a
Bureau de Change sale. Initially processed
as a card payment, but then cash payment
taken.

Deliberately not checking customers ID
where required and there is suspicions this
may be linked to card fraud.

A newly hired clerk forgets to ask the
customer for their ID.

A customer sends high value parcels on a
regular basis. They suspect that an assistant
is stealing the parcel, as parcels do not
reach the destination when processed by
this assistant.

A customer sends a high value parcel but it
is never received by the recipient.

A clerk believes that a branch manager is
using their knowledge of personal customer
information to set up fraudulent accounts.

A customer has received Post Office Money
correspondence to their home but
addressed to another individual.

A customer reports that the branch is not
opened as listed on the website, and whilst
closed they can be seen processing
transactions for other people.

A customer complains that a branch is
opened for hours different than those stated
on the Post Office website.

A clerk complains that the branch manager
has made racist/discriminatory remarks to
other members of staff and members of the
public.

We protect whistleblowers’ anonymity

Our recent [ HYPERLINK “https://poluk.sharepoint.com/sites/thehub/SitePages/Our-
Whistleblowing-Survey-results.aspx" ] revealed some of you are concerned that reports
raised by whistleblowers are not treated confidentially. You may have seen this
recent news article:

Revealing a whistleblower’s identity has large financial consequences

Barclays’ CEO, Jes Stanley, was fined £640,000 for trying to uncover the identity
of an anonymous whistleblower. He had tried to find out the author of two
anonymous letters to the Board that expressed concerns about a senior Barclays
employee.

Mark Steward, FCA Executive Director, commented, “Mr Staley breached the
standard of care required and expected of a Chief Executive”. He added,
“Whistleblowers play a vital role in exposing poor practice and misconduct in the
financial services sector. It is critical that individuals are able to speak up
anonymously and without fear of retaliation if they want to raise concerns.”

All businesses have a statutory obligation to protect whistleblowers and at Post
Office, we believe whistleblowing is a valuable source of information to help us
identify and address risks and wrongdoing.

At Post Office, you can raise your concerns in confidence and without fear
of reprisals, even if they turn out to be mistaken. We will always take
your concerns seriously, and act on them.

Remember, to raise a concern, you can:
-Contact your line manager or HR Director

Based on the survey results, these are the areas that need to be addressed in
whistleblowing communications and awareness and training:

1. There needs to be some improvement in employees’ understanding that
whistleblowing refers to the act of exposing potential or actual
wrongdoing by reporting it either internally within an organisation, or
externally, for example to a regulator.

2. We need to raise considerable awareness about where the whistleblowing
policy sits. The majority of survey respondents said they either did not
know, or weren't sure where the whistleblowing policy is found.

3. Some awareness needs to be raised about how you should report a
whistleblowing concern, i.e. contact the Speak Up confidential reporting
service run by InTouch MCS Ltd o i or via [ HYPERLINK
"https://wrs.expolink.co.uk/postoffice" ] and what the speak up Services is.

10. What can Post Office do to improve the Whistleblowing
service (e.g. do you think it would encourage colleagues to report
more if it was called ‘Post Office Confidential’, is the service
promoted enough)? Full answers can be found here.

Confidential:

1.

Whistleblowing can sound a bit intimidating for some people, or they are

doing something wrong. Post Office Confidential sounds more
approachable.
It would help if it would be called Post Office Confidential

Quotes from respondents:

it should be renamed Post Office

“Employees need to understand what happens when the individuals
the whistle blowing report refers to are the same people that receive
the reports (i.e. GE members). Within CIO the honest challenge
culture doesn't really exist yet. Even lead team members within the
department don't feel honest challenge can happen anywhere except
in a public open forum where they can't be personally attacked. It’s
very much a toe the line or leave if you don't like it culture. Until this
is resolved staff won't trust that whistle blowing will have any real
effect. I've seen things myself over the last 18 months that have
made me want to blow the whistle. But I haven't because of fear of

the ramifications on my career and others in my team.”

“There is a little confusion as speak up and whistleblowing are often
said in the same sentence - even in the quiz - I think there is

confusion about similarities and differences between the two.”

“Make it clearer that if a whistleblower has done the correct thing -
it is right, it’s still seen as you'd be punished for whistleblowing in

some way.”

“Whistleblowing is a scary title - there are stories in the press about
how badly whistle-blowers are treated. It puts people off. I for one
would be extremely reluctant to report anything even if i was
experiencing it myself. I don't have the faith that it would be treated
properly. I have been around a long time and sadly i still feel this

way. Reality is a lot difference from policy!!”
