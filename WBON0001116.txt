Dear Tony, Owain

Briefing note on flags which are applied to SPMR accounts where disputed sum settled centrally
Where an item has been settled centrally and disputed, the agent accounting team apply a dunning block to the open
item on the account. This prevents any further requests for payment being sent to the agent.

The account below shows (in the column titled "block")

e — the item marked with an R is already set up to be deducted from remuneration and therefore blocked for any
further request for payment; and

e the items marked with an M relates to a miskey error where the agent is waiting for a TC, so this will remain
blocked until the enquiry is completed.

The effect of placing these blocks on the system is to prevent a dunning letter (chaser letter) being produced and/or
preventing the item from falling on a processors worklist for further action.

Please also find attached an example of a customer account and an explanation of the abbreviations which are used
in this.

If you would like any further information on this please let me know.
Kind regards
