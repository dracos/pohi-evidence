Yes that's exactly what the Board wanted Al. They discussed assurance before any branches go live and then a
go/no go decision point after some ‘trial branches ' had been using the system to ensure it was robust as POS and
for balancing. There main concerns were twofold

1 that the system worked for customers

2 that the system was as 'sparrow' proof as possible with independent assurance to prove it

Thanks

Gill,
My understanding — Alwen may be able to confirm — is that the Board asked, a long time ago, for us to

ensure that there was a fully independent review of the new IBM software to ensure that it works
accurately before we complete/undertake (?) the roll-out.

At the same time, we need to work out who is going to give an expert assurance to the courts that we
can rely on the system to prosecute people for theft. Fujitsu used to do this but weren’t considered
independent enough.

Could you please give some thought to how we do whatever you do to two birds with one stone?

Thanks Al
