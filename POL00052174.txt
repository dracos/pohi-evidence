Dear Jarnail,

Regina - v - Julian Wilson - Worcester Crown Court.

At yesterday's sentencing hearing at the Crown Court Mr. Wilson was made

the subject of a 12 months Community Order with one requirement namely that
he performs 200 hours unpaid work, In addition he was ordered to pay £3,500-
00 towards the costs.

The timetable was fixed for the Proceeds of Crime Act application but this

is likely to be pre-empted by the full reimbursement of the stolen monies

out of the proceeds of sale of Mr. Wilson's Post Office which is scheduled
for completion in mid September. TI will keep you informed of any developments
that may arise at this end. JI have also notified the Case Officer Gary Thomas
of the result.

As this completes the case I will now prepare my invoice etc. for all the
post committal work which will follow shortly.

Yours sincerely,

JOHN H. DOVE,
