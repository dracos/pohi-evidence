I have placed the words I produced, and Alan's initial comments on them in front
of Roy some time ago.

He asked me to leave it with him.

I have prompted him a few times since then, but ‘he is very occupied at the
moment.

It may be (although I am not sure of this) that he has concerns about how we are
going to 'sell" this 50days onwards.

I think perhaps. it might be a good idea for you Pete to prompt him directly.
With every passing day I think it will become harder to 'sell' it onwards.
