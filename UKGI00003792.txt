Mark and Jane,

I just wanted to say that you have done a briliant job in the preparation for our announcement and subsequently. Of
course, there may well be more trouble and coverage ahead but I think that your success in keeping this out of the media
especially following PMQs, is very impressive.

I hope you and the teams involved get a decent weekend - you all deserve it.

All the best

Alice

Please find below an update from Mark and Jane

Thanks

Dear All
We wanted to update you on media coverage around Sparrow.
As you know, we published our report on Tuesday. There was a very limited media reaction.

Yesterday, James Arbuthnot MP raised the issue in Prime Minister's Questions. He accused us of sacking Second Sight
and destroying evidence. David Cameron was well briefed and responded in a helpful way.

This prompted some media activity but I am glad to say it was confined to BBC Radio Five Live and even then outside
prime time. There was no TV coverage or focus on any of the flagship outlets and nothing in the newspapers this
morning.

We engaged robustly at senior levels in the BBC to support our strategy of minimising media attention and, therefore,
potential brand damage.

This will return when Second Sight's report is leaked, as it surely will be, and if the Select Committee reports. We are
engaging with Select Committee members to impress upon them that this is more complex than some would suggest.

We will keep you updated.

Mark and Jane
