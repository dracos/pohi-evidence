1.

Horizon — the system was unforgiving and did not enable errors to be
corrected — I cannot explain how the deficits arose.

Training — was inadequate both in relation to depth of knowledge and
duration of training — I could not properly operate the computer system
Thad only 1 % days training, I needed one to one advice in person.

Support — the backup provided was insufficient — I telephoned for help on
more than one occasion. The advice I was given did not resolve the
situation. I was in a rural location and there was no one else to turn to
