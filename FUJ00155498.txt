Brian — understand Pete Sewell is away — can you respond to my query:-

This CP was originally scheduled to go out as R17 but is now R2.
As such this would change our planned testing for R2 and our impacts (for R1 we were going to test it just on LST, but
for R2 it would be added to the testing for SV&l).

I'd like confirmation of the targeted release — will it be
« 1 maintenance release (recommended)
© R2
If R2 then the CP should be sent round for re-impacting

Regards
George

The Dimensions database is not yet ready to host the Change Proposals for HNG-X. They are being held on
PVCS for visibility and will be ported across (and withdrawn from PVCS) when Dimensions is available.

Addressees are requested to impact this CP as follows:

On the Change & Document Web Service HNG-X Change & Document Management on the left-hand side of the screen there is
an entry for RMGA, please select this and then select HNG-X CP Impact

This entry can be used by anyone via the hyperlink above and following the instructions:
In principle:

« You do not have to be logged onto the Web to use it, however, it is easier if you are as the form will pre-populate with your
name, e-mail address and telephone number.

« — Users fill out the form using a mixture of free format text, drop down lists with some hints/tips as to what information is
required.

. Having completed the form, choose the SEND button, this will then confirm the information has been sent and email this to
the POA Change Management mailbox.

« — This information is then stored (at the same time as being sent) into a csv file. Every time a user submits an impact it is
added to the csv file, it does not get over-written.

« Change Management will use this information for Board presentation and for porting into Dimensions when that system is
available.

Similar to CP Impacting for Horizon, please ensure that the following information is provided within your impact:
1. MAN DAY EFFORT by Unit (Split incremental and non-incremental, by Grade Rate, activity and quantity)
2. DOCUMENTS AFFECTED (Reference and version number)

Additional to Horizon there are tick boxes to indicate that:
4. HARDWARE IS REQUIRED (details to be provided in the Comments section)
