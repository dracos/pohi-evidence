Attachments: ARC terms of reference Nov 2013.doc; Speak Up (Whistleblowing) Policy POL.doc

Hi Sarah

’m not sure if you’ve received a response from this elsewhere but this is the Whistleblowing policy that went to the
February 2013 ARC for approval. It is dated April 2012 but this is the one that was approved in 2013.

I don’t think that we are in contradiction to our terms of reference because the timetable included as an appendix to the
ToR has the following caveat:

‘] The timetable sets out standing agenda items. It may be modified by the audit committee in light of specific
requests or actions arising from meetings. The months indicated are provisional and subject to change. ‘

I think that a certain amount of flexibility was envisaged and I can’t find anything else in the terms of reference which
would require annual review of the policy. That being said if the policy did need reviewing I am sure that we could look
into adding this as an item to the next Committee agenda.

Thanks
Larissa

Subject: Whistle blowing policy - urgent EY questions

Hi Georgina, Dave,

I think you are the right people but please advise if not. EY asked for a copy of our Whistle blowing policy as part of their
half year audit work. They found an old policy and have asked the questions below about updates, reports through it
and when the ARC will review it. Please could you answer these? We are due to sign off the Interim Report on
Wednesday so need to close this down as soon as possible.

‘1 Updated whistle-blowing policy - We have a copy dated 2012. We have been informed that the policy was last

reviewed by the ARC in Feb 2013. Please provide a copy of the latest whistle-blowing policy.
2. Report on the instances of whistle-blowing reported on the hotline for the HY ended Sept 2014.

3. Larissa advised that ARC did not review Whistleblowing at Feb 2014. meeting; this appears to be contrary to
the terms of reference. Please confirm whether our understanding of the terms of reference is correct, and if so,
whether the ARC will review this later this financial year.’

Many thanks.
Regards,
Sarah
