All

I've converted SS' questions into a Word doc (attached) as I thought this might be a little easier to use / edit and
embedded some comments

There are some sensible questions in here but there is also a massive fishing expedition for information that does not
address issues raised by Applicants. I've highlighted all the questions that I think are just fishing for info There
are aiso a number of questions that are outside the scope of the Scheme. Most telling is the fact that there are only a
handful of questions about Horizon; nearly ail the questions are about accounting practices.

My guess is that it is going to take quite a lot of work to answer ail these questions. We may want to follow the approach
we used for the Factfile ie. break the questions into sections, identify the key technical person in POL to answer those
questions, prepare draft answers and then have a senior and separate sign-of team. Just a thought...

Kind regards
Andy
