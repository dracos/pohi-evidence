Subject: Re: Disclosure of prosecution files [BD-4A.F1D26231777]

Thanks Andy and I realise this was not addressed to me but Chris A wants to pick up with Tom on any o/s SS issues on
Monday.

I spoke to lan about prosecution files last week. Specifically Chris Holyoak's comments about wanting to know as a point
of principle why we are not sending further docs (I.e, there are none, they are privileged etc) and the fact that in some
files requested relate to cases where the final CRR is completed and some cases closed He said;

- with no disrespect to anyone (Il assume he meant Ron) this hasn't been well thought through

- SS know they already have all the files for some old cases

- ss may still want the files in closed cases for context/relevance to wider investigation

- wants to see whole file and is happy to come to us and look through them as he had been allowed to do in 2012

- SS may want further disclosure to applicants even where the case closed.

My takeout from this rather odd conversation was they want POLto release priviledged docs under the auspices of the
Scheme so that we have waived privilege.

He suggested a meeting to discuss.

In the meantime I suggest we:

Remove the completed cases from the table and say in our email we have done so.

Just send the papers that would have been provided to the applicant previously in each case, getting as many across as
we can this week.

I think this should be discussed with Chris A, however, along with all the other info requests for SS so that we are
considering the requests holistically.

Best wishes
Belinda

Tom
A quick summary of the position on the prosecution files:
¢ An updated tracker is attached.

« Weare ready to disclose further documents on: M040, M052, M068, M087 (subject to your confirmation - see
POL00219926
POL00219926

email yesterday), M108

e Wecan confirm to SS that there are no further documents to disclose on: M035, M043, M072, M119 and
M120 (subject to your confirmation - see email yesterday).

Can you let me know who at POL will be able to upload the docs to huddle (Lorraine?) - I'll then send them the
documents by email.

I've set out below a draft email to go to SS for your review.

Kind regards
Andy

From: Tom Wechsler
To: SS

Ron, lan
Please find attached an updated tracker on Post Office's searches for disclosable documents in prosecution files.
In summary:

e There are extra documents to disclose on: M040, M052, M068, M087 and M108.

e There are no extra documents to disclose on: M035, M043, M072, M119 and M120.

We are still looking into the other cases. Ron and Kim both sent through some additional requests to Andy that have
been added into the attached tracker. I'd be grateful if you would confirm that the tracker reflects your view of what is
outstanding.

In terms of disclosing the extra documents, these will be uploaded to huddle over the next couple of days. A number
of the documents contain highly sensitive data about third parties. For example, in one case there are a number of
witness statements from customers who were subject to fraud on their POCA accounts. The statements include
details of their card numbers and bank accounts. After careful consideration we have elected not to redact this
information because we thought you may need these reference details in order to track particular patterns of
transactions.

I know that you do this anyway with all information about Applicants but please do take special care that this
information is kept secure and not used for any other purpose outside the Scheme. Also, where possible, it would be
preferable not to refer to any sensitive information about third parties in any of your reports. If you do think this is
necessary in any case, please could you let me know in advance so we can consider any privacy consequences.

Kind regards
Tom
