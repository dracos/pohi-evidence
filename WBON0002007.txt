Morning Amy, Andrew

Andrew, please could you confirm that the attached documents are the Post Office investigation guidelines which
were in place prior to the new version being adopted in January. If so, please could you confirm when these were
implemented and that we have a full set of the guidelines.

Kind regards

Amy

In terms of confirming that these documents were the previous versions used, would John Scott or Rob King be the
best person to confirm this (since you were not in the team at the time)?

Many thanks

Hi Amy

As mentioned by Andy below, we may need to disclose the previous versions of the investigation guidelines to
Freeths. I believe that the documents which are enclosed in the attached email are the previous version which
was brought into force in 2012. So as to ensure we are reviewing the correct documents, would you be able
confirm this is the previous version of the guidelines and that we hold a full set of documents?

Also, would you be able to provide us the password for the Conduct of Criminal Investigations Policy?

Tf it is easier to discuss the above then please do not hesitate to call.

Kind regards

Jane

Understood. I didn't realise a new policy had been adopted in January so, as you say, this is irrelevant and does not
need to be disclosed to Freeths. We may however need to disclose the previous version that would be applicable to
some of the Claimants. Amy (BD) will speak to Amy (POL) to determine what these docs are and then we can take a
view on whether to disclose them.

Kind regards

Andy

Amy Prime has been in touch with Amy Quirk regarding our prosecutions policy. Attached is the version
which was approved by the POL Board in January this year. We are also in the process of finalising an
Investigations Policy. Neither of these is relevant to any of the claims being dealt with by Freeths, as they
post-date those claims, so I would be reluctant for either of these to be disclosed to Freeths without further
discussion.

Hi Jane,

Sorry about this. The request regarding our internal prosecution policy relates to the below. Amy is aware we
follow the CPIA guidelines in respect of investigation and that full code test review is applied to any case
file seeking to be submitted via ERO prior to it coming to you for consideration as to charge decision /
summoms. However, as part of the horizon piece she asked for a copy of the internal prosecution policy
document. I am assured these will not be sent anywhere externally without your sign off and the requirement
is part of bond dickinson support of the Post Office and not as a request from any other source.

Sincerely Amy

For your information, we are aiming to provide the disclosure documents to Freeths by the end of this week. So as
to allow us time to review the Investigation guidelines and consider / discuss with you whether these should be
disclosed to Freeths, it would be appreciated if we could be provided with them by tomorrow evening.

Kind regards

Dear Amy

I am assisting Andy Parsons with the Horizon dispute.
WBON0002007
WBON0002007

Further to your previous discussions in relation to the disclosure of Post Office's investigation guidelines to
the Claimants' solicitors (please see the attached emails for your reference), I understand that rather than
there being internal Post Office investigations guidelines you instead follow the CPIA and CPS best
practise.

The Claimants' solicitors have requested additional information in relation to any investigation guidelines
and, so as we can ensure that we provide the correct response and documentation, it would be appreciated if
you could confirm which best practise documents are followed (please could you provide a copy of these or
a link to them online) and confirm that Post Office does not currently have / follow internal investigation
guidelines.

If it would be easier to discuss the above please do not hesitate to contact me.

Kind regards

Amy
