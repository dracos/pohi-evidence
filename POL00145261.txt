Subject: ARQ Report issue

Attachment: Horizon data Lepton SPSO 191320 CONFIDENTIAL.DOCX
Martin,

Please see the attached report from the Security team, which identifies an issue with the “ARQ” report POL receives.

The concern is that the ARQ report does not clearly distinguish between transaction reversals which are automatically
generated, and those which are user generated when the branch experiences a comms failure.

Given that this report is considered when forming a view on branch transactions and is used in evidence, can you
please ensure that this issue is considered as part of your review of the historic prosecution files and also in

connection with existing cases.

Please let me know of you need anything further.
Kind regards, Rodric
