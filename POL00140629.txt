2 comments from me :

1) Why am I having to chase a response from you guys after getting it in the neck from the Paula. Saves
response was yesterday morning ?

2) if we believe we need to speak to the Post Master, then speak to him. You guys run the service. Just tie off
with Network so they know

Lesley,
Pervez Kakvi's branch is Barton Road and since September of last year it's logged two calls with the

Horizon Service Desk both for counter printers, which were fixed within the SLA response times.
Therefore I believe we are looking at the service disruption caused by the major incidents we’ve had

over the last couple of months; and nothing that merits close monitoring of Barton Road specifically.

In terms of a response, please have a read of this and see what you think. I’m trying desperately to avoid
talking about the contractual arrangements with Fujitsu as I don’t think this helps.

Pervez,

Thank you for your email. We fully recognise that it’s not good business for our hard working
subpostmasters or the Post Office to be turning customers away, so we are working hard to prevent
further issues. Whilst Horizon is generally a very reliable service, over the last few months it hasn’t been
good enough and we are urgently reviewing how we can improve it. Our focus is on working with Fujitsu
to add and improve the controls and monitoring we have in place.

I'd like to apologise for the recent issues and to reassure you that we are taking action to prevent
further disruption to the service.

Regards
XXX

FYI

Can you look into this and see what happened with this particular branch.
Also what response did we give to the NFSP last week.

Can you also draft an appropriate response.

Mike/ Lesley, Pervexpz is a respected SubPostmasters (who also happens to be a magistrate I think -
hence the court references.

I'd be grateful if you would reply. It is very frustrating to receive mails like this. Pervez is right to raise it.
It is my understanding that Horizon is reliable and we are within the tolerances. But if trusted individuals
like Pervez are now not feeling that is the case, are we monitoring the right metrics? And if we think we
are, might it be possible for you to get a direct link to Pervez so that we can monitor accurately what is
happening in his branch. (Pervez - it may be that perception is worse than reality, as any outage is not
acceptable to staff and customers; but it is possible that it is within acceptable tolerances.

Thank you for flagging it.
