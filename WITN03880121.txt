FOR YOUR EYES ONLY

Dear Keith,

Thank you for your mail dated 28 May 1999. I would also like to
take this opportunity to express my sincere appreciation to you personally
for finalizing the new agreement with the Post Office.

I am in line with you that, I too, am fiercely enraged with the UK
Government, that you had to spend so much of your time, effort and costs in
vain, all because of the irresponsibility of the their Departments, blaming it
on each other. Although ICL is not much to blame regarding the failures of
the project in the past, the fact is, the actual impact on our performance is
significant.

IT am thankful to you for understanding and respecting Fujitsu’s
decision. Instead of arguing with the government now, and risking
additional time, effort and costs, it would be more beneficial for the Fujitsu
Group to tolerantly negotiate with the government, and keep our chance to
try recover the past debt with our own efforts.

This new agreement will give us this chance. However, we still have
as much tasks as we did in order to achieve our project goal. We must learn
from our experiences, and thus gather all of the strengths within the Fujitsu
Group to overwhelm our challenges, and achieve profit for [CL in the total
project.

As a result, this should be an outstanding infrastructure for the UK
Government and the Post Office. I look forward to your further success.

Best Regards,

GRO
FUJITSU
