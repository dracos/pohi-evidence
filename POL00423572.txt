The Chair declared the committee quorate and opened the meeting.

The committee reviewed the minutes and actions from the last meeting.

The following amendments to actions were noted:
Action 1655 - Whistleblowing comms plan to be brought back to the next meeting.

Action 1649 - Commercial Director to give his view on vulnerable customers at the next meeting.
Action 1646 - Produce a paper on what the policy governance process should be (for May meeting).

Action 1631 - Head of Telecoms to confirm that he knows who is responsible for compliance in his

The committee agreed the minutes of the previous meeting and the attached actions subject to the

The committee discussed the updated terms of reference. It was noted that there was

inconsistency in the reporting from sub-committees to the RCC and the committee requested that
an appropriate form of reporting was agreed with the chairs of the sub-committees (Action 1656).

The committee discussed the rolling agenda. The Head of Risk and Assurance explained that it was
based on a meeting frequency of six times a year. It was noted that it had been intended for RCC
meetings to coincide with Group Executive Team meetings, and to take up the last two hours of the
GE meeting agenda, but that this was not yet possible due to current pressures on the GE agenda.
The Committee noted that the timing of reporting from sub-committees needed to be clarified and
that the risk team was working on an incident reporting process.

It was noted that there were a number of the scheduled items which could potentially include
reports on POMS (eg. AML compliance). It was agreed that further discussion was required as to
the interaction between POMS and POL on these items, given that the POMS board would also
require assurance around these matters it was agreed that the Chair would discuss this with the
Financial Services Director (Action 1657).

The committee acon the terms of reference and aa aes

The Head of Risk and Assurance introduced the risk management key principles, noting that
fundamental parts of the principles were:
« A general review of risks and upward reporting to RCC and GE to take place twice a year
« Arisk champion in a frontline role in each part of the business
« Management confirmation that the assessment of risks and controls is accurate (to start in
September 2015).

The committee discussed the principles. The Group People Director noted that the risk
management guidance (Paper 3, Appendix A) that had been issued by the risk team had been very
useful to his team when they were considering their own risks. The committee requested that a

risk management session be provided for the SLT at the next appropriate opportunity (Action
1658).

The committee endorsed the key principles.

The committee discussed the key risks. The committee noted that the aggregation of risks
obscured their meaning and requested that they be disaggregated in order to provide greater
transparency over the individual risk. The committee also asked that the likelihood and impact
scores for each risk be reviewed (Action 1659).

The committee reviewed the proposed approach to Business Transformation Assurance. It was
suggested that the hard reporting line for the two Business Transformation risk and assurance roles
should be to the General Counsel and/or Head of Risk and the dotted line to the Head of
Transformation, which is the reverse of the current situation. Chair and Head of Risk to discuss
with the Transformation Director (Action 1660).

The committee discussed the papers.

The committee reviewed the Internal Audit Plan and requested some amendments (Action 1661).

The committee noted the paper and that the FOI process is under review.

The committee discussed the paper and requested further investigation into the seriousness of the
problem. Group People Director to review the external audit report on adherence to the joiners,
movers and leaver processes. Head of Audit to provide external audit view to Group People Director
(Action 1662).

The General Counsel gave an update on Sparrow.
