the latest Training involved was 2/3 days. | as a Trainer always follow the topics
according to the classroom timetable. When the course was 2 weeks the
Trainees use to complete Balances at least twice in a week, when the course
was cut down to 2/3 days the trainees still complete 2 or 3 Balances as time
permits. During these Balances they were shown how to identify the
discrepancies as well.

. At the end of the classroom courses all the Trainees/ attendees were given the
feedback form with the envelope regarding the delivery/components of the
course. We left them on their own to fill and post themselves without us looking
at the forms.

10.1 consider the Training on Horizon IT System has been adequate. During my
role as a Trainer either in Classroom or Live environment trained lots of
Postmasters/ Postmistresses, every person has ability to absorb the
information differently, some of them were quick learners and some took bit
longer to absorb the information. Some trainees were poor in classroom
environment, but their attitude was completely opposite in live training, and

some were vice versa.

Statement of Truth

be true.
