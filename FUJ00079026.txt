01/12/98 Update Julie Welsh
Call received from Horizon System Helpdesk 30.11.98 They have received a high number of calls from
post offices advising that they are unable to receive in at the post office counter, new order books. The
order books in question all have a new type of printed bar code (hi - speed printing), the bar codes have
a shiny surface which can not be read by the scanner. The Horizon Helpdesk ‘st had calls on this
problem on Thursday 27.11.98. An engineer was sent out to check equipment, but everything was found
to be in order. The problem appears to lie with the incompatibility of the surface of the barcode and the
scanner at the counter. ALL calls are being logged individually by the Helpdesk.
The problem is not restricted to any one area or any one benefit (book groups 5,7,11,13 have all been
identified so far). The PO clerks know that to attempt to enter the barcode details manually will result in
an impound instruction. The number of calls has increased dramatically; the number of effected PO's has
now reached 39 returned to DSS as per their standing procedures.
My contact in DSS is Jim Brown/ Florence Narey at Newcastle. My contact for POCL problem
management is Phil Turnock in London.
I have requested confirmation that the advice provided by the Helpdesk is correct, I have verbally
received confirmation that this is correct. I have faxed details of the calls registered to date to both BA
and POCL. I have requested visibility of an example of the new barcodes from BA. Dave Cook
(requirements) that ICL Pathway (T&l) were not given sight of the new barcodes prior to usage advises
me.
I have requested an immediate and urgent response to the problem, and an assessment of the extent the
problem may reach. I have asked that a universal message is sent to all ALPS and automated PO's to
advise them of the problem and the required action.
02/12/1998 Update - By Julie Welsh
Update Telephone call from Florence Narey BA, BA in Bristol have received a batch of 25 returned order
books with the defective barcodes. A meeting is being held in Norcross on 3.12.98 to look and test the
books with the ACC staff. The books are not a new issue, but have been in use since September and
over 6 million have been issued to date, without any problems. The books were fully tested prior to issue
i.e. for scanning ability. She will advise me of The results as soon as possible. She has asked if the
Helpdesk can pick up the order book batch numbers from the cover of the defective books (4 lines with 3
numbers, on right hand side of cover), they have agreed to do so. BA has issued a bulletin today to BA
offices alerting them to the problem and to expect order book returns and customers with Queries. The
benefits affected are Income Support, Child Benefit, Retirement Pension.
03/12/1998 Update - By Julie Welsh
Batch Identifiers, are now being logged by the Horizon Helpdesk and have all been passed to Florence
Narey along with latest call information received. No further update.
03/12/1998 Update - By Julie Welsh
BA will issue a bulletin to BA staff on 4.12.98(we will be copied in). POCL have decided not to issue any
information to PO Counters .BA are awaiting further returned order books from Newcastle PO's as the
ones returned and examined so far have proved inconclusive. All call details to date have been passed
to BA. No further update.
08/12/1998 Update - By Julie Welsh
Meeting in Newcastle on Monday 7/12/98, spoke to Jim Brown. He advises they have had over 30 books
returned now NAD EDS are still investigating. Basically they have established the problem has arisen as
a result of a badly printed barcode batch on 14.11.98. Calls have declined a little but still coming in,
latest details passed to Jim today. Update sent to Horizon for information.
Next Action: Waiting for further update from BA
11/12/1998 16:24:52 - By Julie Welsh
Telephone call from Horizon 11.12.98. The number of calls from Post Offices reporting failure to read
barcodes has dropped to almost nothing. However a few calls are now being received from PO's
regarding replacements for the customers due on Monday 14th December.
In particular Helpdesk received a call from a postmaster who had contacted the local Benefits Agency
office (Sunderland) on the customer's behalf. The BA clerk responding to the call said" He had no
knowledge whatsoever of any problem with bar coded order books and suggested the Postmaster
contacts the Helpdesk to report his problem. "The postmaster rang Horizon for advice and was a little
irate to be told the BA had been advised of this problem previously.

I contacted Jim Brown in Newcastle who assured me the Bulletin went out to all BA offices last week, he
arranged to send me a copy. Copy of Bulletin received, it was issued on 4.12.98(copy in file). I have sent
a copy to Horizon for their information. Investigations are still progressing at Newcastle.

Update 14/12/1998 - By Julie Welsh

Telephone Call with Florence Narey 14.12.98. The problem has been identified as "intermittent print of
unreadable barcodes." The only books to be effected were Pension books in one print run on the night of
23/24.11.98.

Next Action: The situation is to be discussed at the Problem Management forum on 15.12.98, where a
more detailed report will be given.

Update 17/12/1998 11:55:36 - By Julie Welsh

Update from Problem Management forum 15.12.98. As confirmed by Florence a print run on the night of
23/24th November of 7000 pension order books (Group 13) were identified as defective immediately, and
it was thought all had been destroyed. However 400-500 books slipped through the net and were
despatched to PO's which caused the problems. DSS are sure all books are now back and destroyed and
replacements have been issued. Although the information received from post offices indicated that the
books were not confined to one benefit, the only books, which have subsequently been returned to DSS.
offices, have been pension books. Checks have been made to CHB Centre to establish if any books had
been returned there, there were none. No further explanation could be provided by DSS.

ITSA service management is now chasing this up to ensure this does not occur again. Telephone calls to
Horizon on 17.12.98 to confirm calls have stopped.

23/12/1998 11:20:31 - By Julie Welsh

Between 14.12.98 and current date several more calls have been received from Post Offices regarding
badly printed barcodes. Horizon has provided details of these calls and some batch details. It appears
that the books are for a later date than weeks commencing 14th December as originally suggested
reports suggest the books are for dates in early January. I have sent all new details to Florence Narey in
Newcastle to investigate, she has asked for specific details of some of the customers effected. Horizon
helpdesk are now logging customers name: NINO: Book Number: Benefit type.

Next Action: These details will be passed to Florence as soon as possible to continue her investigations,
to be updated on 29.12.98.

31/12/1998 09:59:34 - By Julie Welsh

Telephone call from Horizon Helpdesk, telephone calls are still being received from Postmasters
regarding books they are unable to scan. PO FAD 292511 has rang again to say the books are still
turning up and she is very annoyed that nothing has been received from POCL to indicate a problem with
books and the action to be followed when received. Advised Horizon I would chase up and give her an
update today if possible. Telephone call to Florence Narey - problem has not been identified yet so
POCL can not issue any information. She will check progress and update me with latest information.
04/01/1999 11:34:11 - By Julie Welsh

Several more calls received from various postmasters on unreadable books. PM's are becoming
increasingly irate at the lack of information and the continuing problem. BA has started to receive more
returned books and are investigating the problem at the moment. All new information passed to Florence.
Next Action: awaiting update from Florence, hopefully by 11.1.99.

05/01/1999 11:46:28 - By Julie Welsh

Telephone call from Horizon helpdesk, they have received several more calls from postmasters stating
they are receiving contradictory information from Benefit Agency offices on action to be taken when they
are unable to scan order books. BA advise the PM to ring Horizon Helpdesk, they will then authorise one
weeks money and the book will then need to be impounded and returned to BA. This is not the correct
procedure. For newly received books at the PO, an attempt must be made to scan the book 3 times, if it
still does not work, the book is to be impounded and returned to DSS. Horizon is Following the correct
procedure. Details of the BA offices concerned have been passed to Florence to investigate.

Telephone call from Horizon Helpdesk to advise of customer complaint regarding problems with books.
PM Peter Laurie (Northumberland) is extremely unhappy that BA/DSS do not appear to be offering any
information on the current problem

There appears to be a lack of action from both BA and POCL, Customers are being seriously effected
and he feels he will lose customers if this problem continues. He has raised the problem with his regional
network manager and expects some action to be taken shortly.

Telephone call to Florence NAREY to report the above problems. Florence advises POCL are preparing
a bulletin to be issued to PO's as soon as possible (we will be copied into this). She has contacted one of

FUJ00079026
FUJ00079026

the BA offices to check out the incorrect information, there appears to be some confusion about the
exact circumstances at the post office when the PM phones.

e Le. if he tells the BA clerk he is attempting encashment then the clerk is advised to give the

answer as above.

The clerk should really confirm if the book is being received for the first time, which would give a
completely different response in line with the Horizon Information. Consideration is currently being given
to issue of a new bulletin to BA staff to clarify the situation.
We will be kept informed of the action being taken. She will speak to POCL about the customer
complaint.
30 order books have now been received back in Washington and tested by EDS. All 30 books have
successfully scanned.
We have agreed to attempt scanning in the Pathway domain and arrangements are to be made to have
the books brought to Bracknell for the Pathway SSC team to test.
Next Action: Awaiting further information from Florence today.
05/01/1999 14:42:04 - By Julie Welsh
Telephone call from Florence Narey, 54 books have now been returned and tested, all but 6 have
scanned. 30 books are on their way to Pathway for testing. BA bulletin is being issued to benefit offices,
copy will be sent when ready.
Telephone call from POCL, they are dealing with customer complaint via telephone.
Next Action: Await results of testing on books.
07/01/1999 12:05:16 - By Julie Welsh
PO has now issued a bulletin to Post Offices advising them of the correct action to take on unreadable
barcodes (copy held in file). BA have issued a bulletin to BA offices giving details of the problem and the
correct action to take (copy held on file). These two bulletins should at least reassure the PO clerks
involved that action is being taken, calls are still being received from disgruntled PO clerks.
The books returned are being examined again as further investigation has revealed a change made to
the paper in September may have contributed to the current problem. At the moment the books will be
retained at Newcastle for further testing. A small number of books (6) may be tested at Borough High
Street on the OBCS scanner. Awaiting further update.
14/01/1999 11:57:37 - By Julie Welsh
Several more complaint calls have been received from PO's regarding lack of information from
BA/POCL on this ongoing problem.
I rang Jonathon Rodgers POCL to ask what action they proposed to take on reassuring PO's that action
was being taken and their complaints had been recognised.
They are unwilling to ring individual postmasters, but took the details anyway because the two in question
FAD's 201328 and 153504 have made many calls and are extremely unhappy. I have asked POCL for a
firm line to be used in response to the Postmasters complaints.
Meeting in Newcastle 13.1.99 with BA/POCL. BA are to provide a written update to the barcode problem
by 15.1.99 but basically the problem is occurring due to moisture in the paper used, once printed with
barcodes the print is smudging. BA has now escalated the problem and the priority has been raised both
with ITSA customer services and to the Service Review.
New paper is due in by Friday and testing will commence. It is estimated that approximately 500 books
have been effected to date and still rising. It is generally restricted to Pension books only. A question was
raised regarding a misunderstanding that BA would be sending out a memo/letter to PO's this has never
been the case.
BA has dealt with their own staff and POCL have dealt with PO staff. (Copies of both memos have been
provided to Horizon Helpdesk)
A request has been made by BA to have OBCS scanners installed into BA order book production sites
(4) to assist with random testing to avoid future problems. The request has been passed to The Pathway
CS Operations Manager 12.1.99, awaiting a response.
A further request was made to arrange a meeting between an OBCS ‘techie’ and Mike Stevenson (BA) to
check the sensitivity of the scanners being used. I am pursuing a contact, possibly within
Implementation.
I have a reply from Wendy Atkinson at POCL on the response to be given to Postmasters who continue
to telephone Horizon with complaints. They suggest they be told to ring the POCL Regional Helpline, as
Horizon helpdesk are unable to provide any additional information. Wendy has asked that they are kept
updated with the number of complaint calls received from PO's.
15/01/1999 10:06:30 - By Julie Welsh
Horizon helpdesk have been advised of the new information from POCL about referral to Regional
Helplines.

FUJ00079026
FUJ00079026

I have emailed Pathway Implementation with the contact details for Mike Stephenson the ITSA Service
Manager 01253 688133 to arrange to get together and discuss the OBCS scanners any problems
surrounding the "sensitivity" of the OBCS scanners.
I have dropped a note to The CS Infrastructure Manager re. Installation of scanners at ACC’s, as I
understand he is now looking at this.
Response received from BA " EDS first thought the problem to be moisture in the paper used to produce
the order books, and this was causing a problem when the laser print fuses the barcode to the book
cover. EDS/ITSA are now unsure as to whether this is the actual cause of the problem. The problem has
been escalated, by ITSA, to the highest levels within customer information service, as they are aware of
the impact that this is obviously having,
A meeting has been arranged for 15.1.99 to progress the issue. Because of the escalation Alexis
Cleveland, The Director of Operations Support, is now aware of the problem and is being kept updated
as to investigations. An update from the meeting will be provided as soon as possible.
Audrey Adams to monitor this PINICL from 16.1.99 until my return on 8.2.99.
18/01/1999 18:02:28 - By Audrey Adams
Following update received from Florence Narey:
PIRA have examined the paper supplies and concluded that the relative humidity levels of paper were
read, as 7% when an acceptable industry level is 5.3%. PIRA confirmed that they would expect to see
significant problems with print fusion at the present moisture levels.
In addition, PIRA discovered that the paper supplied did not have the necessary ink-hardening agent
present. This meant that the inks present in the paper were not curing and therefore further hampering
the fusion of laser print. The hardening agent had been removed from the printing process.
Arrangements have been made for the hardening agent to be replaced immediately. The reintroduction
of the hardening agent alone may make a significant impact on the current issue. However, until paper
with the reduced moisture content is forthcoming, it is not possible to measure the full impact of the
change.
Mike Stephenson (ITSA CS) is awaiting a response from TSO (paper provider) to be able to advise the
timescales for the expected resolution of the problem.
Scope of the problem:
The figure recorded across both ALPS and OBCS from 7/12/98 to 8/1/99 is 3188 from a total of almost
12M order books produced on new print lines.
21/01/1999 17:01:47 - By Audrey Adams
Summary of progress since 14/1/99:
Root Cause has been traced to changes in the printing method, introduced towards to end of last year.
BA have commissioned PIRA to research the problem further (1 assume this research will include
remedial actions!)
POCL are in the throes of releasing Horizon Update # 16 (Item 2. Faulty Barcodes). In this article, Pas
are being encouraged to channel their complaints/concerns to their Regional (POCL) Helpdesks rather
than to HSH. A Special Notice is also to be sent out at the same time which details the activities outlined
in my update of 18.1.99 above. I anticipate this update and notice will be distributed early during w/c
23/1/99. HSH has been advised of this new complaint channel.
BA has requested ICL Pathway to supply scanners to each ACC as a preventative measure for the
future. This supply, together with a proposed technical forum, is still to be finalised.
25/01/1999 11:11:47 - By Audrey Adams
New evidence added - Horizon Update No 16. Item 2. Faulty Barcodes
New evidence added - Special Notice regarding Faulty Barcodes
Item 1 above. - Report is due from PIRA by end of month.
Item 2 above. - Horizon Update 16 and Special Notice distribution. Copies attached to PinICL.
29/01/1999 10:47:11 - By Audrey Adams
PIRA Report has confirmed findings outlined above - missing ink hardening agent and moist paper.
Resolution:
Instructions have already been issued for the re-introduction of the hardening agent in the ink.
New ‘drier’ paper is due to TSO on February 1 for initial print work. This should then be with EDS approx.
2 weeks later, who will conduct appropriate tests to ensure it is now within spec.

e Scanners. These will be supplied to BA within 1-2 week. Currently awaiting cables.

. A temporary procedure for issuing new books is being discussed within BA.
29/01/1999 17:19:25 - By Audrey Adams
An Authorised Temporary Procedure is being issued.
Essentially, if a barcode fails to scan, the PM will:

eCheck the manual stoplist

e If not on the stoplist, cancel the barcode using the date stamp

e Treat as a non-bar-coded book — i.e. not using Horizon equipment.

FUJ00079026
FUJ00079026

The procedure will be issued over the weekend as Horizon Update 17 and will be effective from February
2 1999 until March 27 1999.

A copy of this Update will be appended to this PinICL upon receipt.

04/02/1999 14:56:05 - By Audrey Adams

Authorised Temporary Procedure was issued on Monday with effect from Tuesday February 2. Details
are above. Currently awaiting further update from BA regarding the 'new' paper, although

I do not expect significant updates before end next week.

12/02/1999 14:40:24 - By Julie Welsh

Telephone conversation with Florence in Newcastle. The new paper has been tested and the full report is
due out today, but not received at the time of this update. Florence has promised an update as soon as
the report is available.

17/02/1999 09:29:35 - By Julie Welsh

Report on tests received from Florence and attached. Basically tests on different ink have been carried
out but the results are not available until sometime later this week.

OBCS equipment is in place in Washington and tests will be carried out and a follow up technical
meeting is planned.

New paper supplies are currently expected on 7th March.

17/02/1999 09:29:38 - By Julie Welsh

New evidence added - update on tests on new paper

17/02/1999 09:37:26 - By Julie Welsh

Memo received from Implementation giving results of Welch Allyn tests on books.

"The reason that the ST3400 Pathway scanner struggles to read the sample bar-codes is due to poor
print quality of the bar-codes. After investigation we found that the narrow bars are very fine and in some
cases are broken.

An attempt was made to analyse the samples using a bar-code verifier but it responded with
“unrecognised symbol set" as it could not confirm the bar-code data."

26/02/1999 09:30:45 - By Julie Welsh

Further update received from Florence (BA) in Newcastle, the number of books affected up to 15.1.99 is
4522. All books are being issued as full books i.e. 20 weeks. With this in mind I have drafted a memo
with a view to some form of compensation from the authorities. I am awaiting further figures from BA,
these have been promised as soon as possible. BA is unable to advise when ‘scannable’ books will be
back in circulation. Tests have yet to be carried out on the new paper with the reduced moisture content,
paper due to be delivered 8th March.

04/03/1999 15:29:46 - By Julie Welsh

Telephone call to Jim Brown, BA, 3.3.99, no new information, testing still in progress. Advised Jim we
would need the "on loan" scanner back from EDS when tests are completed. No further update expected
until the paper is received and tested.

12/03/1999 12:17:26 - By Julie Welsh

Update received from the Cross-Domain meeting held this week. Paper has arrived and tests have
commenced, the tests will not be completed before the end of March and a full report is due out mid
April. The ATP is due to end on the 27th March. Customer Service has asked that action be taken to
ensure that this procedure does not extend beyond the end of April 1999. Florence Narey has
responsibility for all action to ensure this is resolved before that date.

19/03/1999 15:04:16 - By Julie Welsh

As per last week we are still awaiting results of tests of the new paper and ink. A better update will be
available at the end of the testing period.

25/03/1999 16:21:50 - By Julie Welsh

As per last week full report not due till mid April. Recent discussions with the DSS have confirmed that
accurate figures of order books effected are not currently available. It was agreed to wait the conclusion
of this problem and pursue accurate figures at that point in order to make a final calculation of any
compensation payable.

Telephone conversation with Wendy Atkinson POCL. Full paper test results are due out 12.4.99. The
Authorised Temporary Procedure was issued with an open end date, although it was not originally
expected to go beyond 27.3.99 (paper tests have taken longer than anticipated ). The procedure will be
cancelled when full results are issued and the new batch of paper has been given the all clear. I have
been promised an update as soon as available.

09/04/1999 11:10:33 - By Julie Welsh

No further update until 12.4.99 earliest.

16/04/1999 10:07:27 - By Julie Welsh

Verbal report received from Florence Narey on paper tests.48? tests have proved inconclusive, only 7
have been found acceptable. There is little improvement in the paper quality. A decision has been made

FUJ00079026
FUJ00079026

to reorder paper from another supplier. The order and further tests will take approximately another
4weeks. This will obviously extend the ATP beyond NR2 which is not as agreed at the cross-domain
meeting in February. I am awaiting a full written report and comments from POCL on the extension
22/04/1999 18:14:11 - By Julie Welsh

Further verbal update received today from Florence Narey. Full test results are currently not provided to
Florence, I have asked her to check out if I can have a copy. I am told that the new paper for testing will
be available earlier than previously advised and PIRA have promised a report by 14th May 1999. The
ATP has been extended to the end of June 1999 in agreement with POCL Dave McLoughlin, this was
agreed at the Horizon service review meeting on 21.4.99.

Telephone conversation with Florence Narey CAPS re.test results. The tests are finished but the results
will only be initially available to DSS at a meeting to be held on 20th May. Agreed an update will be
provided after that date.

18/05/1999 12:10:04 - By by Julie Welsh:

Telephone conversation regarding EDS contact. lan has spoken with Brian Blane; his concern is future
changes to scanner software, which may impact, on readability of the barcodes. Agreement was reached
that the CP process should pick up any impact from that area (providing someone in CAPS lets them see
the CP in the first place). I agreed to check with CAPS as to how this will work.

25/05/1999 17:26:53 - By Julie Welsh

Telephone conversation with Florence Narey CAPS.

1. CP impact- Florence will check with the relevant parties how this might work and let me know if there
are any problems.

2.Paper tests - The latest tests have been more positive. The laminating process now needs to be added.
If all is ok, new paper supplies will need to be ordered and production can recommence. Awaiting further
update.

No DSS update. No clear direction on OBCS future as yet. New associated problem regarding tolerance
of scanners raised by POCL on behalf of DSS. Audrey Adams is problem manager for new area, results
of this investigation will have impact on closure of this PINICL.

CALL PC0026481 opened

BA wish to flag up that tests using the OBCS bar code scanners are showing a higher failure than tests
on ESNS. They want an explanation and ICL Pathway’s proposals for bringing the OBCS system up to
the same tolerance as the ESNS system.

This is linked (obliquely) to the ongoing ‘shiny barcode’ issue of damp paper and non-drying ink.

Next Action: I am awaiting full details of progress to date.

Should be able to see evidence (i.e. logged incidents) prior to those that prompted PinICL PC0019130,
approximately mid-December 1998.
My next action is to review calls logged during Q3/1998 for evidence of scanner failures.

Wendy Atkinson advises that BA have been given until August 23 1999 (ie start of NRO) to resolve this,
at which point the ATP will be withdrawn.
Call metrics for Q3 and Q4/98 are 9 and 136 respectively. These figures have been forwarded to Wendy.
My next action is to await an update from Wendy, which I will chase w/c July 5

Contrary to my last update, as this has 6-months' worth of history, this will
be the master call and PC0026481 has been closed.
Last update was:
We have been asked by POCL to 'prove' that the OBCS scanner is conformant to specification.
I have had a discussion with the Peripheral Products Centre at KIDO1 this afternoon and we discussed
the additional test requirements. I have asked for confirmation of the specification from Welch Allyn and
details of the tests we carry out to prove’ compliance at build/installation (as required).
In return, I have been asked for confirmation that the tests carried out by BA earlier this year were
compliant to ‘Code 3 of 9'-standard barcodes and that their tests have included the original paper and ink
combination.
I do not have this detail, so have requested this from POCL.
