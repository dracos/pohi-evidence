Hi Mark and Andy,

Attached is

a draft of the high level milestones (Andy you may need to make sure the slide fits in with overall style of the

presentation).

What we need to make sure is that as cases are mediated the PR and Public Affairs team get given a head ups so we can
manage press/MP attention. In addition, as of the 31** October we will know the full list of cases (via the application
process) — at this stage we will want to assess the media/MP implications and update plans accordingly.

Mark if you could comment via email to Andy that would be great. Andy are you then happy to update the slide
accordingly?

Thanks
Sophie
