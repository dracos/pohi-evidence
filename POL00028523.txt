(ON POCL LETTERHEAD]

Keith Todd Esq.,
ICL ple,

26 Finsbury Square,
London,

EC2A 1DS.

24 May 1999

Dear Mr. Todd,
POCL AUTOMATION PROJECT

POCL, ICL Pathway, ICL and DSS have been negotiating, with the assistance of HM
Treasury, the withdrawal of DSS from further involvement in the Project and certain
material amendments to the existing contracts between the parties.

Most recently, negotiations have proceeded on the basis that the Project will be
amended to introduce a new service, the Benefits Payment Service or BPS, and the
draft Heads of Agreement dated May 1999 between POCL, ICL Pathway and ICL

+ (document reference 207738/10582 CA991020027 JRT 060599.2352) (the “Heads")

reflect that position.

Ministers have decided that the Project will be scaled down and completed on the basis
that the claims of each party against the others will be settled on the following terms:

1. The Heads as.amended by Schedule 1 to this letter take effect from the date
hereof.

2. ICL Pathway will complete its obligations under the Related Agreements, as the
same are amended by the Heads, and as the Related Agreements and the Heads
are further amended by this letter.

3. POCL will pay ICL Pathway the sums set out in Schedule 2 to this letter in the
manner and at the times set out in Schedule 2.

4. ICL Pathway will provide services under the Related Agreements (as amended)
until 31st March 2005 (notwithstanding any later date that may appear in the
Related Agreements or the Heads). On cessation of the services, POCL will
have the option, subject to due payment of all sums payable up to that date, to
purchase from ICL Pathway for the sum of £1 the Project Assets (using the
definition of that term in the Heads which is expressed to be ‘ICs view’), such
Project Assets to be sold “as is”, free of encumbrances including perpetual
royalty free licences of all IPRs in accordance with the Related Agreements but

207738/10582 CA991460.044 PKYL 090699:1021

POL00028523
POL00028523

with all express or implied warranties and conditions excluded to the full extent
permitted by law.

5. In parallel with performance of ICL Pathway’s obligations under 2 above, and
following our discussions with you, we wish to confirm our desire to use the
Core System for network banking and the provision of services (via smart
cards) for Modern Government. We will therefore work with you to revive and
continue the discussions on the Public Private Partnership which we have
previously considered. It is hoped that we can together develop a business
strategy in these areas which we can deliver through appropriate arrangements
under a Public Private Partnership in order to leverage the use of the Core
System and develop to the full its potential for the delivery of electronic
business services.

6. ICL Pathway shall provide such services as may be agreed by ICL Pathway and
POCL for Royal Mail, DVLA, NAS, Girobank and the Co-op (and other POCL
clients as may be agreed) at marginal running costs.

7. This letter agreement will come into effect on signature and will remain
binding on all parties unless and until replaced by a comprehensive codification
of the relevant terms of the Related Agreements, the Heads and this letter (a
“Codified Agreement”) which is agreed between all the parties thereto. The
parties will use reasonable endeavours to produce and agree such a codification
by 16 July, 1999. This provision shall be without prejudice to any change to
this letter, the Heads or the Related Agreements which is agreed between the
relevant parties in accordance with the terms of the document in question.

8. In the event of any disagreement concerning the terms to be included in the
Codified Agreement, POCL and ICL Pathway will negotiate in good faith to
reach a resolution of the matter in question. If the Managing Director of POCL
(or any equivalent executive) and the Commercial Director of ICL are unable to
reach resolution of the matter at their initial meeting to discuss the same they
shall invite an expert to give guidance and act as a facilitator. Where the matter
in question is of a programme or technical nature, the expert shall be Peter
Copping of PA Consulting Group (or, if he is not available, a person chosen in
accordance with paras. 6.2 and 6.3 of Schedule 6 to the Heads). Where the
matter is of any other nature the expert shall be an independent City solicitor to
be agreed between ICL Pathway and’POCL within 7 days of the date of this
letter or, in default of agreement, to be appointed at the request of either of
them by the President for the time being of the Law Society. ICL Pathway and
POCL do not expect that the identification and notification of the disagreement,
reference of the disagreement to the expert and obtaining his guidance should
take longer than 7 days.

If the parties have used all reasonable endeavours to agree the terms of the
Codified Agreement, including pursuing the dispute resolution procedure

'207738/10S82 CA991460.044 PKYL 090699:1021

above, but by 16 July, 1999 material issues still remain unresolved, POCL shall
have the right (to be exercised by a written notice served on ICL Pathway by 30
July, 1999) to terminate the agreement contained in this letter including, for
the avoidance of doubt, the Heads and the Related Agreements as amended.
Where POCL does not exercise this right of termination this letter shall continue
in force. However, this shall not prevent POCL and ICL Pathway from agreeing
to replace this letter in its entirety with an incomplete Codified Agreement
which incorporates those matters which have been agreed and, as regards
matters which have not been agreed, carries forward the relevant parts of the
agreement contained in this letter. In the event that POCL does exercise its
right of termination pursuant to this paragraph, it will make a payment of £150
million to ICL Pathway less the sum of £68 million referred to in Schedule 2,
paragraph 1 if, at the date of such termination, the sum of £68 million has
already been paid to ICL Pathway.

9. The terms of this letter shall be in full and final settlement of all claims and
counterclaims which any of POCL, ICL and ICL Pathway (the “Parties”) may
have against any other of them under or in connection with the Related
Agreements arising from or in connection with acts or events which occurred or
should have occurred, or statements that were made on or prior to the date of
this letter (whether or not such have been made the subject of a claim or
counterclaim at the date hereof). Each of the Parties hereby waives any rights
whatsoever which it might have against any other Party arising from or in
‘connection with such acts, events or statements.

Words defined directly or by reference in the Heads bear the same meaning in this
letter, unless the context otherwise requires. In the event of any conflict between the
terms of this letter (including its schedules), the Heads, and any of the Related
Agreements, the order of precedence shall be as follows (and so that the document
listed earlier prevails over the document listed later):

This letter (including its schedules)
The Heads
The Related Agreements.

Any amendment to this letter shall, to be valid, be made in writing under the hands of
the signatories hereto or persons holding equivalent positions in the department,
agency or company in question.

In the event of any disagreement concerning the terms of, or arising under, this letter
the Heads or the Related Agreements, the Parties or such of them as are in
disagreement shall negotiate in good faith to reach an amicable resolution of the
matter in question, but in default of resolution within a reasonable period any relevant
Party (that is a Party having a direct interest in the matter in question) may apply to

the courts of England & Wales for the matter to be resolved in accordance with English .

law. This provision shall be without prejudice to the specific provision for the

Retention Sum, POCL shall pay to ICL Pathway in respect thereof an amount
equal to the Second Retention Sum divided by the lower of 48 and the number
of months from the date of such conversion to 31 March 2005 until the full

Operating Fee shall be adjusted pro rata to the number of Post Offices installed
relative to the number planned to be installed at the CS Completion Date

Annex 4 to Schedule 4 of the Heads for the period up to 31/03/2005;

(ii) an Outlet cost element of 32% of the amount in the table above, which
is based upon the parties’ intention that Pathway will roll out the Core
System to 18,573 Outlets. .

The amount of the Transaction volume cost element shall be adjusted for each
month by the proportion of the actual Transaction volume (calculated in
accordance with Annex 1 to Schedule 4 of the Heads) to the Transaction
volume forecast in the month in question, and the Outlet cost element will be
adjusted for each month by the proportion which the actual number of Outlets
to which services are being provided during such month bears to 18,573.

In addition, POCL shall pay for the cost of Pathway carrying out operational
business change in excess of the limits set out in the Related Agreements on an
incremental basis at marginal cost plus 10%.

the system including maintenance of the Post Office and data centre
infrastructure including help desk support, all telecoms charges including line
costs and usage charges, and Management Information Systems.

ICL Pathway will be subject to service level commitments and liquidated
damages according to the Related Agreements and that these will be set off
against payment. The service level commitments and liquidated damages
relating to Counter Transaction Times will need to be adjusted to take
reasonable account of the exclusion of BES.

POCLs rights to set off any sum against payments to Pathway shall be as set out

by Clause 804 of the Authorities Agreement, save that POCL shall not be ©
entitled to set off any sum due other than under this letter agreement.

ANNEX 1 TO SCHEDULE 4
Transaction Metrics for Charges

It is proposed that transactions should be counted for charging purposes according to the
following rules. The default is that 1 customer-facing transaction in reference data = 1
chargeable transaction. The following are the main exceptions:

Transaction items: 1 chargeable transaction per transcash item. For the avoidance of doubt,
there will be no chargeable transaction associated with the fee payable on the transcash
item.

Postal orders: i chargeable transaction per customer session, regardless of number of postal
orders sold. For the avoidance of doubt, there will be no chargeable transaction associated
with the fee(s) payable on the postal order(s). Where postal stamps are sold to make up the
odd amount of a postal order value (e.g. the 27p of a postal order of value £35.27), these
stamps will be counted as a chargeable transaction in accordance with the metrics for postal
stamps (see below).

Phone cards: Sales of phone cards of the same denomination to be rolled up within a
customer session. For example, if a customer buys 2 x £2.00 cards this would be 1
chargeable transaction; however if the customer buys 1 x £2.00 and 1 x £5.00 cards this
would be 2 chargeable transactions.

Saving stamps: 1 chargeable transaction per client, per customer session regardless of the
quantity and combination of saving stamp values sold. For example, if a customer buys 1 x
£2.00 and 2 x £5.00 British Gas saving stamps and 2 x £2.00 BBC licence stamps this would
result in 2 chargeable transactions.

Postage stamps: Sales of postage stamps within a customer session to be rolled up into 1
chargeable transaction regardless of quantity and combinations of stamps sold. For the
avoidance of doubt, postage stamps includes definitive and special issue stamps of all
values, stamp books and postage-paid stationery. It does not include other postal products
such as datapost or special delivery. For example, if a customer buys 2 x 1st class, 42p of
other postage, 3 x stamp books (10 x 2nd class) and a book of 10 x 1st class stamps, this
would be 1 chargeable transaction.

Because it is recognised that the volumes of postage stamp sales in the Workload Brief is
subject to statistical uncertainty in deriving the average value of transactions, the charges
will if necessary be adjusted retrospectively as follows:

. The actual average value of stamp sales per transaction will be calculated by dividing

the total value of stamp sales recorded on Horizon by the number of customer
sessions in which stamp sales were recorded.

'207738/10582 CA991450,103 PKYL 100699:1851

POL00028523

POL00028523
—_—_——_ —- —
14
. The intended average value of stamp sales will be calculated as £2.51 multiplied by
the average RPI for the relevant invoicing year and divided by the average RPI for
the year ending February 1996.
. The adjusted amount payable for postage stamp sale transactions will be calculated

by multiplying the charges by the actual average value and dividing by the intended
average value, any under or over payment will be included as an adjustment to the
next monthly invoice.

. This adjustment will be calculated annually during the roll-out, and a final
adjustment factor, to apply in all subsequent years, will be calculated at the end of
the first full irivoicing year following completion of roll-out.

Retail items sold over the post office counter: Charged as 1 transaction per line, i.e. 1 item
of each of 2 different lines = 2 transactions, 2 of the same line = 1 transaction.

Entry of sales not transacted through Horizon: i.e. postshop, vending, lottery etc. Charged
as 1 transaction per batch entry for each product (e.g. 60 lottery ticket sales and 60 vending
items = 2 transactions).

Reversals: Where transactions are subsequently reversed, the transaction itself will be
chargeable as usual, the reversal will not be chargeable, and any related fresh transaction
will be chargeable.

Use of scales: Each price look-up for postage items using the scales link or by manually
keyed input will incur a transaction charge for the EPOS Scales transaction in the Day 1
scorecard (scoring under Terminal, EPOS, Scales, SIS batch and no other columns) unless
the counter clerk aborts the transaction without proceeding to a subsequent stamp sale
transaction. These scales transactions will only be initiated by the clerk selecting them from
the screen or keyboard, and will not be initiated by customers placing items on the scales
without clerk intervention.

Premium Mails Services: Each item requiring separate entry will count as 1 transaction (e.g.
posting 3 datapost packages which require separate recording). Where items are entered as
multiples (e.g. posting 2 parcels of the same weight with recorded delivery to the same
zone) these will count as a single transaction.

Scales, premium services, and postal order transactions are additional to any related sale of

postage stamps, but no more than 1 postage stamp sale will be recorded per customer
session regardless of the use of those stamps.
