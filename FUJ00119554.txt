4.2 Duplicate Receipts

Duplicate receipts are marked with the word ‘Duplicate’ and as many as are
needed can be taken immediately after the original receipt.

4.3 Reversaly

For all conventional transactions a reversal is shown as negative, with a trailing
minus sign to balance out the erroneous transaction. The volume of any price
within a group will be shown net of reversals.

4.4 Definition of Terms

4.4.1 Mondetory

The term mandatory is used for reports that must be taken in order for a Stock
Unit Balance to be completed and rolled over to the next balance period or CAP.
If there are outstanding mandatory reports, the stock unit will not be able to be
balanced and to roll-over to the next period. At the Stock unit level, all
transactions must be reported, hence a report must be taken if there are
outstanding transactions, and the system will not allow the user to proceed until
the report is taken. Note that pre-viewing the report will allow the user to
proceed.

When the Stock Unit Balance report is selected, the system checks the balances.
If there are outstanding summaries to be taken, it will display a list of all the
outstanding summaries with those that are mandatory clearly identified.

Similarly, those Office reports identified as mandatory must be taken before the
office can be rolled over to the next Cash Account Period. However, the system
will allow the user to proceed without printing the report. Such reports can be
previewed and subsequently taken as reprints, in order to capture all the
transactions.

4.1.1.4 APS Receipts

Note that APS receipts are produced automatically as part of the transaction.
Thus the term ‘mandatory’ when applied to APS has this meaning.

4.4.2 Cut-off
Stock Unity

The term cut-off means that the clerk must touch the Cut-off button after taking
the report in order to effect the cut-off, resetting the report contents to zero. Any
subsequent transactions will appear on the report for the next cut-off period.

Cut-off is automatic for all transactions in a stock unit when a roll-over (CAP or
BP) is performed. Otherwise the clerk must touch the cut-off button.

Office
The following Office reports are not populated until the Stock unit cut-off
reports are taken:

Office Daily: Giro Deposits, Giro Withdrawals, NS Deposits, NS Withdrawals, BT
Bills, UKPA.

Office Weekly: Green/Violet Giros, POs Encashed.

Office reports that are cut-offs of cut-offs are reset to zero until the cut-off is
taken at Stock Unit level.

4.4.3 Time ow Reports and Receipty

All times shown on reports and receipts are local time.

4.4.4 Customer

To the Post Office Clerk the Customer is the person standing in front of him or
her.

4.5 Field Alignment

The general principle is for left hand fields to be left aligned, and right hand
fields to be right aligned.

4.6 Preview Facility

A report preview facility is provided to allow the report contents to be assessed
by the user.

The report preview will provide a WYSIWYG representation of the anticipated
printed output with accurate display of the report format, content and
pagination.

information) and taking the printed report later when the printer is working.

for a transaction entry the maximum is 9,999,999.99-
for a summary or total entry the maximum is 99,999,999.99-
for a summary of summaries (total of totals) the maximum is

999,999,999.99-

Note that there may be other limits imposed by reference data.

There is no currency symbol on any APS or EPOSS report or receipt.

4.7.2 Volumey

The standard field size for a volume (a quantity) is 99,999.

4.7.3 Signy

Signs (negative) are only shown on amounts (currency) for reversals, and if they
cannot be inferred. Where the net value of a summary is negative as a result of a
reversal the total will be shown as negative. The exception is that negative sign is

always used on customer receipts.

4.11 Representing Products Ww Examples

Product names are driven by POCL Reference Data, and as the Horizon System is
deveoped and improved, and business needs dictate, the names of products may
change and products may be added or removed. Consequently, the report
layouts are examples, actual product names in reports may vary.

4.12 Session and Transaction IDy

Both session and transaction ids have a format of:
n-nnnnn-n

The last segment is usually a single digit, but can be three digits. This suffix
changes for each transaction. The middle segment is the same for all transactions
within the same session.

Receipts show the session id which always ends in ‘-1’.

Transaction ids are the same format, but do not necessarily follow on in
sequence from the session id.

Both session and transaction ids are unique.

Transaction ids are shown in the Transaction Log report - the session id is not,
even when it is used to specify for which session transactions are reported.

Notes:

Refi will contain the Client ID. This is used along with the token type indirectly to
match against the validation object to identify the token.

Ref2 will contain the customer reference.

SC1 - SCn will be definable by the specific card. Both the values and the field names
will be definable.

The values in these fields will contribute to the composite checksum and will be
checked, on input by the clerk, against the checksum.

The use of the checksum in recovery situations is described in the CSR+ APS PPD.
The checksum allows the validation of the data input during the recovery.

Each smart card has separate limits on the amount, and these are imposed during
validation when the amount is input by the clerk. So, although theoretically, the
amount on the receipts is the same for all including smart, the software imposes
checks which would prevent this theoretical limit being used for the currently
supported smart cards.

EPOSS produces receipts with headers and footers in both English and Welsh,
but these are not included here, for reasons of clarity.

In the tables of field definitions, the line numbers refer to the overall line
position. Thus, where a section of a report is repeated in an actual receipt, the
line numbers of such sections and subsequent ones will vary.

7.20 Counter - Weekly Miscellaneovy Transactiony

7.20.1 Purpose

This is an office report.

7.20.2 Frequency
Weekly.

7.20.3 Notey
Cut-off.

Reversals will have trailing negative, all other transactions are positive (because
they are grouped in collections with homogenous accounting sense).

Exceptions to this are Unclaimed Payments and Uncharged Receipts, both of
which include positive and negative transactions. In the example below,
Unclaimed Payments is shown as netting to zero because the losses (2600) equal
the redemptions (2601).

7.20.4 Sequence

By Product, within Level 1 Group, within Level 2 Super-group; in transaction
order (chronological order) within Product.

Products, Level 1 and Level 2 Accounting Nodes are in Accounting Node number

order.

7.57 Stock Unit Balance Report

7.57.1 Purpose

This is an office report and must be retained for two years.

7.57.2 Frequency

One per balance period; thus can be more than one in any CAP.

7.57.3 Note
Mandatory.

Summary of all transactions performed in the stock unit and the totals by
product of the cash in hand and the stock in hand at the close of the BP/CAP.

For an active stock unit, a ‘Trial Balance report’ is printed when the report is first
selected; after the Trial Balance is agreed, the report is selected again and the

second print, titled ‘Final Balance’, is printed.

For a Dormant stock unit, this report is produced automatically when the
inactive stock unit is rolled over, by selecting ‘Inactive SU Rollover’ from the
Office Balance menu. The normal stock unit balance report is produced but

titled 'Trial Balance Report’. The brought forward and carried forward will have
values, as will any discrepancies and stock values, all of which are rolled forward.
As there are no transactions, other values will be zero.

7.57.4 Sequence

The report has the following sections:

The arithmetic is:

Receipts + Balance B/Fwd = Total Receipts

Payments + Stock + Net Discrepancies = Total Payments

Stock + Net Discrepancies = Balance C/Fwd

Transfers, remittances and revaluations are included in the respective Receipts
and Payments totals.

Within each section, Products are listed in Product order (PLU number), within
Sub-group within Group, where Sub-group is equivalent to Level 1 and Group is
equivalent to Level 2.

Level 1, 2 and 3 nodes are also in numerical order, and each such summary line
follows the list of Products that it summarises.

7.64 Transaction Log

7.64.1 Purpose

This is an office report.

7.64.2 Frequency
Ad hoc.

7.64.3 Note
Optional.
Both session and transaction ids have a format of:
n-nnnnn-n

The last segment is usually a single digit, but can be three digits. This suffix
changes for each transaction. The middle segment is the same for all transactions
within the same session.

Receipts show the session id which always ends in ‘-1’.

Transaction ids are the same format, but do not necessarily follow on in
sequence from the session id.

Both session and transaction ids are unique.

Transaction ids are shown in the Transaction Log report - the session id is not,
even when it is used to specify for which session transactions are reported.

7.64.4 Sequence
Chronological order of entry, against the following filter criteria set by user:

SU, CAP, User, Date From, Date To, Value From, Value To, Mode, Session ID,
Node ID.

7.66 Cash Account Report

7.66.1 Purpose
This is a dual-purpose report, both office and client. It must be kept for six years
by the office.

7.66.2 Frequency

Weekly, unless the user has selected a two or a three week cash account roll.

7.66.3 Notey

This report is mandatory, and two copies are produced automatically on
completion of the cash account.

The initial, trial, version has ‘Trial’ printed after the title, see section 7.67. If
necessary, the trial can be exited in order to rebalance. Once committed to the
final version, then the two copies are printed. The final version is as shown in the
example below, and has ‘Final’ printed on it.

In the event of a printer failure, it is possible to 'take' the report by viewing the
preview, which will allow the roll-over to a new CAP. The report can then be
printed later.

Null values are suppressed unless in Table 12 in which case ‘o.oo’ is printed for
values, and ‘o’ for volumes.

7.66.4 Sequence

The report is in sequential page order.
