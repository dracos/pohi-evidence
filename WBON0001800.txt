No corrections or changes from me. Not sure Lord Grabiner will have a chance to review this morning, but
no doubt he will expand on his view on the call.

T attach a short note of the conf’ we had with Lord Grabiner.

Can you make sure it matches what you took from the conf’ ?

The ideal would be for Lord Grabiner to "OK" it this morning so it could go as a "confirmed" note (as
opposed to simply my note) to the Post Office Board in advance of the 11.45am call that Lord Grabiner has
this morning with them. If that can be done (assuming you are with Lord Grabiner at some point this
morning) then great. If not, no worries.

Thanks
