Please see attached submission on Post Office Limited (POL) executive remuneration for the
Secretary of State. This is in response to a query he raised last month — you will recall we previously
submitted this advice in August but agreed to change the approach following advice from SpAds.
Richard Callard discussed this submission with Meg last week and we have redrafted it in line with her
suggestions.

Note that we will be providing advice to the Secretary of State next month on the full package of
POL’s proposals for this current financial year, 2016-17. While this will be significantly later in the year
than we would have expected, I agree with the submission’s recommendation that the Secretary of
State consider the whole package together, including proposals for the long-term bonus, once POL
have developed these in line with their future strategy.

Richard Callard es in the UKGI POL team would be happy to answer
any questions.

Kind regards
Mark
