Richie,

My understanding is that the 90% relates to cases where there is a discussion at the working group. The other 10%
are the ones where there is agreement to mediate without need for a Working Group discussion. The purpose of the
Working Group is to form a view on whether cases should be mediated, so to say that this important part of the
process is ‘blocking’ is slightly specious. But it may be increasingly academic.

Alysa
Just to clarify one of the comments Peter and I said yesterday regarding the Horizon scheme.

e As we stated, the rules of the scheme give the chair a casting vote as to whether a case should go to
mediation or not, if the JFSA and POL disagree. However, each party can still decide whether to participate in
the process or not as mediation is by its nature voluntary.

* POL has to date declined to mediate in only 2 cases (so unclear where James Arbuthnot gets his “90% of
cases” from)

e Reasons to decline include where an SPM has say admitted theft, or where the case is so vague, such that
there is nothing to really mediate on. It is worth noting that each mediation process costs up to £30k so POL
does view each case with a critical eye.

Kind regards
Richard

Hi all,
Just a couple small things I noted during our catch up and would be grateful if you could take forward.
¢ Jo would like to press Paula on the timings of Network Expansion and the rolling out of the Mini Post Offices
in their meeting next week. Can this be in the briefing please.

e Her steer would be to leave the cliff as Sept 2015 unless there are huge benefits of moving it. Can you let POL
know this at official level?
