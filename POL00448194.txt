Contract Advisor — Induction & Training Programme

1. Introduction

The role of the Contract Advisor is to manage a postmaster against their
contractual obligations across those branches in the Postmaster network
(not DMB or Strategic Partners). The role is required to understand of the
postmaster contract (s) working with the wider Retail Team the Contract
Advisor helps postmasters deliver high performance standards and, where
necessary, they deploy procedures to manage and resolve contractual
breaches to help meet these standards.

The nature of the role means that they are responsible for reviewing
matters that may, in due course, lead to the termination of a postmaster’s
contract. It is important then that the proper training is given so any new
member of the team fully understands the policies behind the decisions
being taken and the processes to follow.

4.3. Governance
Head of Contract Management & Deployment

Post Office Ltd has policies governing the management of its
contractual agreements with postmasters. These policies explain
that, in certain circumstances, there may be situations where Post
Office needs to either suspend or terminate a Postmaster’s
Agreement. To ensure our policies are implemented as fairly as
possible, as well providing the proper support to Post Office
colleagues who implement the policies, additional governance is in
place to support these decisions.
