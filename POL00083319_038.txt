Dear Ms Train

Post Office Limited -v- Mr Lee Castleton

We act on behalf of Post Office Limited in relation to a claim against Mr Castleton, in respect of net losses
that occurred at the Marine Drive branch whilst he was the sub-postmaster. I understand that you were
his assistant at the time and I would like to interview you with a view to preparing a witness statement for
use in this claim. The purpose of the interview would be to obtain from you your version of events during
the period in question.

Please can you confirm whether you are willing to be interviewed. If so, then I suggest that we arrange a
mutually convenient time and date for me to meet you at the Marine Drive branch.

1 look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.

Yours sincerely
