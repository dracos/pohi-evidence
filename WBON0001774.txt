Jane, Rod"

The strangeness continues.

See below. You'll see Lord Neuberger confirms he agrees with Lord Grabiner's assessment of the Judgment (the
"treacle" comment) and then comments on football...and sent from an iPhone.

I will have to rebalance my views of life.

T
Tony,
I agree with you re the judgment.
And I agree with Tom Beezer re the football but I am not sure that you are onside with that
opinion.

Tom/Rob,
Treat this as my broad ‘yes that is ok’.

I'm still wading through the treacle of this mad judgment. I dont understand what he thought
he was doing or what he thought he was supposed to be doing. The constant repetition of the
mantra that he wasnt deciding anything outside of the common issues is hardly credible. I’ve
yet to get to the many other matters but I can see from Gideon note and from the various
quotes that it just gets worse.

Tom - if you need to communicate direct please do. Theres no point is going via Rob because
he’s full of West Ham thoughts this weekend.
