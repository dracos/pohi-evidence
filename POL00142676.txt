Dave/Adrian the issue has been investigated by Fujitsu but they can not replicate the error.

Therefore I have asked the Branch to report the issue the next time it happens to the Help Desk at Fujitsu so that Fujitsu
can obtain the necessary evidence to investigate the issue fully.

Team -
The issue that Adrian refers to in his email relates to Horizon. Could you look into this and determine the facts and what
actions need to be taken. Can you update me when you have some information.

Thanks,
Dave

Subject: Branch feedback

Lesley,

First of all — happy new year!

Secondly, a quick bit of feedback / question from my time in branch before Christmas. There seems to be a slight glitch
with the Quantity function, especially when used with stamps. It seems quite random as to whether the quantity selected
follows the user into the next screen when selling loose stamps. Sometimes it does, sometimes not. On occasions the
quantity clears back to 1 but then when you select the stamp denomination suddenly remembers the quantity. The
feedback from St Peters Street branch is that this is the single most common cause of losses in their branch.

Could you have one of your team investigate please?

Thanks,

Adrian
