Ben,

My view is that we should proceed expeditiously and, if a further "QA" process is required before we can be sure we

have provided everything, we need to make that clear in our communications with the Claimants.

The situation we want to avoid is where we say we have given full disclosure but in response to probing by the Claimants

we find ourselves having to reveal more.

Thanks. How have we previously disclosed the KELs ~ did we have a forensic consultant design the process and assure it?

My view is that the disclosure needs to be made quickly and our obligation is to make the disclosure. It is then a
separate issue around the level of assurance, review and analysis (including having the experts consider) the additional
disclosure. There is already a significant risk that the delay that this issue creates is that it could cause the judgment and

settlement discussions to be delayed.

As HSF is instructed by the Board, I would like to have their view and be guided by that recommendation (and Im happy

for preliminary assessment to be challenge).

Kind regards

Sorry for the misunderstanding Red.

Ben — are you abie to provide instructions on the below or does this question need to go to the board / elsewhere?

Post Office has three principal options for the extraction:

POL-0039514
POL00043032
POL00043032

1. It can rely on Fulitsu to extract the documents, disciose them to the Cs and take no further action. This may leave

problems latent or to be discovered and raised by the Cs. I don't believe that this option is in line with the general
strategy of “owning the story" around this issue.

2. Itcan have Fujitsu extract the documents now, disclose them to the Cs and then ask a forensic consultant to
retrospectively assure the process (having told the Cs that the assurance is being conducted). If any issues are
found, these would need to be explained to the Court and the Claimants and, potentially, further / corrective
disclosure may be needed. This could further damage Fujitsu's / Post Office's credibility.

3. Itcan engage the forensic company upfront to design and assure the extraction process, but this could add days /
weeks to the extraction. We cannot give a firm time estimate for this until the forensic consultants have
commenced work (which could be started today).

Kind regards
Andy

Thanks. I don’t agree with the final point —- we need instructions on whether quick extraction is preferred to assured but

slower extraction.

Rod

Tom Beezer

All

See below. FJ are now content to proceed with the extraction without waiting for financial clearance.

In terms of the scope of the extraction, we intend to ask FJ for a copy of all previous versions of KELs up to January 2019,
being the last KEL extraction date. More KELs will have been created after that date (and the Cs know that already). The
concern with extracting all KELs up to today's date is that we will be adding more new KELs. A line has to be drawn
somewhere otherwise disclosure is a continuously moving target and we need to be consistent with our previous
approach to this. We are seeking Tony Robinson's views on this urgently before giving Fujitsu the final instruction to
proceed.

l understand from a conversation between Rod and Amy that we are to commission the extraction from Fujitsu now so to
get the documents out as quickly as possible, but we are then to retrospectively assure that process through using a third
party forensics firm. We will provide a list of options for this shortly.

I’m unsure where the financial aspects have got in the FJ ~ POL commercial process, I'll defer to Pete / Matthew on that
one. Having said that, I now have internal approval to complete the work regardiess, once WBD ask us to start the

extract.

In stating earlier that “Given clearance now, we’d have the information to you tomorrow lunchtime” I had forgotten it
was Friday! In mitigation, this is just my second day back from leave. That statement should have been: Given clearance
now, we'd have the information to you lunchtime the following working day.

Further to the below and our discussion yesterday, I understand that to extract the previous versions of the current or
deprecated KELS as HTML files it would be necessary to produce a new script. Please could Fujitsu proceed with
producing this script, butnot run the script until we provide further confirmation to do so?

if you could let me know and ETA for this script being ready it would be much appreciated.

Many thanks

This part: “{t]he KEL only contains the current database entries’”— I’m not completely clear what that is intended to

mean, but it may be clarified by the following:

This is correct: “is constantly updated and so the current version will not necessarily reflect the version that was in place

at the relevant time”

The second sentence is not correct: “The previous entries / versions of the current entries are no longer available".

You may recall that there are three status categories of KEL: current, deprecated and deleted. For those that are current
or deprecated, they have been updated in such a way that previous content is not permanently overwritten, but instead
a new version is created, with the previous versions being retained and accessible. For those that have been deleted,

only the last version at the point of deletion has been retained.

Subject: KELs - query [WBDUK-AC.FID27032497]

Matthew,

Post Office is seeking to quote from its Electronic Documents Questionnaire submitted back in 2017. It is seeking to rely
on the following quote in relation to KELs

“[t]he KEL only contains the current database entries and is constantly updated and so the current version will not
necessarily reflect the version that was in place at the relevant time. The previous entries / versions of the current entries

are no longer available".

Can you confirm that this is definitely the correct position (i.e. that previous entries are no longer available)? We need to
respond to Freeths by 10am tomorrow, so confirmation ASAP would be appreciated.
