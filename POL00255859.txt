IMPORTANT - PLEASE READ THIS MESSAGE IN ITS ENTIRETY. IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT ITS CONTENTS ARE COMPLIED
WITH.

IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS IN RESPECT OF ITS CONTENTS OR EFFECT THEN PLEASE CONTACT ELISA LUKAS OR RODRIC
WILLIAMS IN LEGAL SERVICES.

As you may be aware, 91 mostly former postmasters have issued a High Court claim against Post Office
Limited advancing allegations about the Horizon IT system and Post Office's engagement with them. A list
of the 91 claimants is attached, and we have been told that others may join the claim in due course.

Now that Post office has seen the claim, you and your team members must familiarise yourselves with Post
office's document disclosure obligations, and ensure that you comply with them. Please therefore
circulate this email to your team members who may hold documents related to the claimants and/or their
claim.

In short, the three crucial document rules that must be followed are:

qa) You must not destroy or delete any documents which may be relevant to the claim. In particular,
make sure that any automatic deleting/archiving systems are suspended now until further notice. If you
have any question about whether a document is relevant, please contact Legal Services and preserve the
document in the meantime;

(2) You must not amend any existing documents which may be relevant to the claim. For example, do not
make handwritten notes on existing documents or try to change the content of a document; and

(3) You must recognise that any documents that you create from now on may have to be disclosed to the
other side in the case. If in any doubt, think about whether you would be happy for the email or document
to be read out loud in court.

I attach a more detailed note on this, which can be used as a reference going forward.

If you have any questions concerning these requirements, please contact Elisa Lukas or me for further
guidance.

with thanks for your cooperation, Rodric
