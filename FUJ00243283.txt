Setting the Stage on Ethical Culture

BUSINESS ETHICS

ETHISPHERE ALLIANCE
Power of informal systems on behaviour

INFORMAL SYSTEMS are stronger influencers
than FORMAL SYSTEMS when it comes to
encouraging conduct and developing culture.

Decision derailers such as PRESSURE, FEAR,
ASPIRATION, or perceived FAIRNESS can
lead a person to choose an action that is
misaligned with their espoused belief in
doing the right thing. Many ethics and
compliance programmes do not include
measures to combat these decision
derailers.

In Your Own Words: Manager Consistency

Compliance programs will fail if senior
leadership is not prepared to invest in them.
This is not just about training courses, but
about investing in the tools, personnel, and
time to ensure laws, regulations, and policy are
followed and tracked, right from the very start
of the CSLC, and not pressuring business units
to continually cut corners in the pursuit of
profit.

ETHISPHERE

Consistency of approach
through the higher layers of
management is not always
visible. Working on customer
site can impede effective
support.

In Your Own Words: Awareness & Training

Our intranet is complex and structure of
information often moves around and not all
matters re: Values, Compliance, Ethics etc are
in a single home. So whilst I know everything
is published, i often have to do a few searches

to get where i want to be. I want Fujitsu to be a better,

fairer place to work - but have
doubts about how fairly any
report would be handled.

Compliance training should

be mandatory with

consequences for not

completing.
