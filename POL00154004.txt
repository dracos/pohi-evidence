Summary

Context

. We agreed to start explaining performance in our Operations to enable a shared understanding of where we are and ensure focus
on improvement

Questions

. How did Supply Chain, Support Services, IT and MI perform for period 1?

Conclusions
Supply Chain

Improvements are apparent in both accidents and sick absence numbers.

Quality of Service for CViT is expected to show an improvement on P12 and last year’s performance.
Cost and Income are broadly on target for the month.

Engagement improved significantly since the last survey; up five percentage points to 59%

Support Services

April service levels improved across our Branch & Customer support team due predominately to dual running. The scorecard metrics have
been amended to reflect expected service levels whilst in transition from Dearne to Chesterfield and new advisors get up to speed

The consolidation of the service centres into Chesterfield is well underway with 20 new customer helpline advisors operational.

Our final recruitment drive completed 6th May; 119 roles filled ahead of full contact centre readiness by the end of July 2016.

The refurbishment of Future Walk completes mid May in readiness to receive the relocated teams - 23rd May further 12 colleagues from
Branch Standards, 31st May further 21 colleagues from POEX, 4th July further 43 colleagues from NBSC / Customer Care and 30th July
remaining 35 NBSC and Customer Care colleagues are operational from Future Walk.

April experienced an increase in the number of Severity 1 and Severity 2 incidents

An issue with POLSAP data resulted in additional work to ensure Agent Pay was processed for scheduled payroll run

Transtrack experienced multiple failures this month. The planned upgrade is due to go live 14th May 2016 ©
AEI had 140 branches unable to process transactions due to corrupt user profiles. Program underway for AEI PC refresh

Our People focus remains on safety and sickness

Compliance and Safety

Accidents below target, much improved on last month and lower than Pi last year.
None of the accidents resulted in lost time - providing an excellent start to the year.
There were 2 attacks (Swiss Cottage and Princeville (Bradford)) in P1. Both were ‘case

snatches’ whilst crossing the pavement. Our people are reminded to remain vigilant for this
type of attack.

Losses from attacks totalled c.£7k in the period; below last year’s monthly average of £9.25k
and well below the average monthly loss of £28.08k in 14/15.

Blameworthy accidents are above target but the weekly average is an improvement on last
month and comparative YTD figures also show a year on year improvement.
Vehicle and Driver Telemetry, due to be implemented in Q3, will help to reduce blameworthy accidents.

Colleague

Sick Absence falls to 3.36% (4.07% in March and 4.03% for FY 15/16) and is now within target.

Long Term sick absence reduced considerably as key depots such as London East benefitted

from people returning to work.

The 2016 survey results showed that Supply Chain engagement stands at 59%; this is up from

54% in 2015 survey and higher than the Post Office overall. ae

A solid financial performance with the IRIS letter
sent out on Monday 9* May.

Customer
. P1 Quality of Service for CViT remains low at 95.91%.
. Root Cause Analysis is unavailable at this point.

Contribution

. Both cost and income are broadly on track for the month.

* The transfer of the Wholesale Cash Team to the Treasury Liquidity Team has enabled business to reduce
it’s on-balance cash holdings by £20m a night; which saves £200k per year.

Change

* The Transtrack Project has been given gating approval to go live; this is anticipated to be before the
end of May however the date has yet to be confirmed.

* The WH Smiths deal will see an increase in POL CViT serviced ATMs over the coming year. A work-
strand is underway to plan the best way of implementing these from a Supply Chain perspective.

. Project IRIS has been re-planned due to the week’s delay with the S188 due to be sent out now on the
9th May with formal consultation beginning on the 16*,

Support Services Transformation — a reminder

Support Services will provide effective and efficient “back office” support to the branch network
and central functions to enable postmasters, branch managers and operators to run their post
offices as successfully as possible

Support Services Transformation is constructed around three broad improvement levers:

1.

2.

Optimisation of ways of working within the service centres — instil lean principles; root cause
analysis; continuous improvement; reengineer and standardise processes

Consolidation of service centres sites — reduce the number of locations from which “Back
Office” Support Services are provided. Realign management structures; introduce spans of
control in line with best practice

Automation/technology enabled - robotics process automation; case management tool;
optimisation of systems

Support Services approach is underpinned by three guiding principles:

1.

Right First Time — reducing failure demand by designing and delivering products, transactions

and processes that mitigate the risk of error and in the event of errors occurring root cause

analysis is undertaken as part of the business as usual process.

One Number to Ring - branches have only one number to ring to access “Back Office” support.

One View of the Branch - case management tool enables join up across “Back Office” support

services and a one team approach. 6

Support Services Transformation - the journey so far

Consolidated site at Chesterfield
+ Relocation to consolidated site at Chesterfield is underway and ahead of schedule:
- IT upgrade is complete
- Refurbishment will be finished mid May
- Recruitment of new people to fill the 119 (includes branch standards) roles is also complete
- 20 new Customer Helpline staff are already working from Chesterfield
* Teams exit from Leeds Admin and St Helens end May as per plan. Dartford exit completed in January
Branch & Customer Support Team
+ ¢50% of new people recruited to Chesterfield - customer scorecard metrics for Q1 & Q2 reflect the
expected service levels whilst new recruits and ways of working embed. Metrics will be reset at Q3
+ People recruited for attitude - already evidenced in performance of new helpline advisors
+ New structure effective from 1st July. Roles and responsibilities refocused on customer service fulfilment;
root cause analysis and continuous improvement.
+ Process re-engineering and training on lean ways of working continues across branch & customer teams.
+ Call recording now in place enabling enhanced coaching of branch & customer advisors
+ BT Intelligence system now in place enabling responsiveness control of call options ie proactive
management of calls
FSC & HRSC
+ Strong leadership now in place - Joe Connor appointed to Head of Shared Services from 1% April
+ FSC - Further template reduction - c 25 roles (29% reduction) removed from template 16/17
+ FSC - Robotics Process Automation — proof of concept during May to identify opportunities
+ HRSC - decision to replace Advice Line with mailbox postponed until Success Factors Implementation

however £140k efficiencies agreed at CRG will still happen in 16/17 €
In that context the Branch & Customer operation is in line

with expectations

Support Services: KPI Commentary — Customer

Branch & Customer Support:

Dynamics call logging tool was down for a full week with all advisors across both NBSC and POEX having to operate
manually ie whilst calls could be taken advisors did not have access to the knowledge base or process maps. The issue
is linked to a certificate. Investigations are being undertaken with supplier as to how this can be prevented in the future.
NBSC resource gap remains a key issue for impact on service provision, however training plan well underway in
readiness for the closure of Dearne House on 31 July. Whilst grade of service is low for the overall period, the last week
of the period saw service levels significantly improve due primarily to the routing of calls more effectively into the
centre. Call abandonment rate is also reducing across both centres outturning at c.6% in the last week of Period 1.
POEX Grade of Service continues to improve period by period - new recruits are handling calls and having a positive
impact on performance during dual running period

CCU missed target , however, this is linked to the Dynamics issue as the backlog of complaint handling was significant
and directly affected the ability to close the cases within the target.

ECT has not had access to the team shared drive since the migration of EUC which has made if difficult to track historic
and on-going cases. There are 42 telecoms cases from the shared drive which are currently being reconciled with the
Telecoms team. Work is being done with Tom Wechsler to understand requirements for 2016/17 and discussions will be
held with Tom Moran to understand how his new role can help with the resolution of difficult network cases.

FSC:

Invoices Paid on time - 23% paid late. 66% (2012 invs) relate to one supplier and are due to the way the credit us
for returns and due to returning non conformant upload invoices to suppliers

Customers Paid On Time — 100% of settlements made on time despite adverse IT issues - resulting to a number of
workarounds in place to obtain settlement data

We experienced an increase in the
number of incidents compared to
the previous month.

A total of 2 Severity 1’s and 12
Severity 2’s recorded this month.

Failure to process Client Account
periods load from MDM to Horizon
resulted in additional work to
ensure Agent Pay was processed in
time for the scheduled payroll run.

Transtrack experienced multiple
failures this month. This was as a
result of the age of equipment and
application causing outages. The
upgrade is due to go live 28" May
2016.

AEI had 140 branches unable to

Business Information Management - Cost Reduction

Headcount reduction : £195k pa of savings
* Consolidation of MI teams completed on 22 April.

+ Initial savings of £193k pa identified and HR1 forms completed and staff consultation will commence w/c 9 May
+ Exercise underway to identify further staff savings within BIM resulting from eradication of duplicated activities / new
systems/ revised processes

Non-staff cost reduction: £420k pa of savings

+ Atos are contracted to update product and branch master data at a cost of £89k pm. They do this by rekeying data
sent to them by various teams in POL.

+ By using the workflow capability inherent within MDM, POL teams can input some of these changes directly to MDM
reducing the requirement for re-keying by Atos.

+ This approach has been agreed by the impacted teams, particularly Property Projects and IT and will save £35k pm.

+ Itis planned to complete the implementation of the new approach from 1 September 2016.

Data cleanse: £45k pa savings

Data cleanse activities continue. We have identified that £35k was paid to agents in FY15/16 relating to the capture of a
second form of customer ID even though a second form of ID was not captured. A change to Horizon is needed to fix
this problem which will be delivered in July 2016. We have removed 592 of the 792 redundant products available for sale
on Horizon having prioritised those being transacted in error most frequently NB: total transactions related to these
products in FY15/16 was 43,879 resulting in agents pay of £5k. The exercise will complete by the end of June 2016.

GE Performance Report - Customer P1 2016/17

Author: Andy Viggars Sponsor: Martin George Date: 9/5/2016

Executive Summary

Context
This is the Period 1 2016/17 customer report for the Group Executive (GE), covering Voice of Customer,
FS NPS, Social Media, and Complaints.

Questions this paper addresses
1. What is our performance vs. target on our key scorecard metrics?
2. What is the performance by Network segment and product?

Conclusions

Performance in the first period of the year is encouraging, especially in terms of the in-branch experience
(via Voice of Customer), with Customer Satisfaction and Wait Time Acceptability on or ahead of their
targets, and NPS only ipp below its target.

As seen through 2016/17, Crown continues to lead the way in terms of Voice of Customer scores, scoring
higher than targets (which are already higher than for other segments of the network).

FS NPS, having seen a very strong P12 sees a 6pt month-on-month decline, to +28. However, this is still
on target, and in line with the full year outturn from 2016/17.

*Changes made to VOC (as previously communicated, see Appendix) mean we cannot make direct comparisons to
previous periods. At the end of Q1, we will be doing analysis to enable us to calibrate historic data and allow
comparisons.

**Also as previously communicated, these changes may in themselves lead to changes in scores, so we will be
reviewing performance and targets during Q1, to adjust if necessary at the end of Q1. Therefore, although the
commentary below includes comparisons with targets, they are subject to change.

« Effort - at a Network level, Effort (those saying Post Office is easy to do business with) is
74%, 6pp higher than target
* All segments are performing well, with Crown leading the way on 77%, 10pp ahead of target.
The score for both Agency and WHSmith is 71%, 1pp and 4pp ahead of their respective
targets.
= By product:
« — Effort for Passports is 82%, well ahead of the overall target of 68%. Crown continues
to be the strongest performing segment with a score of 83%, followed by WHSmith at
81%, then Agency at 76%, also well ahead of target.
«For Travel Money customers the Effort score is 81%, led by WHSmith at 86%,
followed by Crown (82%) and Agency (72%).

«As seen through 2015/16, Mails continues to be the product where fewer customers
say Post Office is easy to do business (74%). Crown is ahead of the other segments
with a score of 75%, although Agency (74%) and WHSmith (72%) show similar
scores.

« With Mails making up such a large volume of customers, it remains important
that we focus on making these transactions as easy as possible.

* By day of week/time of day:

« The Effort score is highest on Thursdays (76%) and lowest on Sundays
(62%). Indeed, on Sundays, the score is particularly around lunchtimes
(11am-2pm, Effort is just 48%).

« Within Crown, the score is highest on Thursdays, and lowest on Mondays.
More specifically, Thursdays after 5pm show the lowest score (70%).

* In WHSmith, Thursdays are again the best performing day at 77%, with
Tuesdays and Wednesdays having the lowest score of 69%.

* In Agency, Mondays and Fridays are the days with the lowest Effort scores.
Mondays after 5pm, and Friday lunchtimes (11am-2pm) also perform less
well in Crown score just 66%.

« NPS - Ata network level, ipt below its target, driven by Agency
= By segment:

= Crown scores the highest with +73 (+5pp vs target), followed by WHSmith at +64
(+1pp vs target), then Agency at +55 (-4pp vs its target), meaning it is Agency
which is pulling down the overall Network-level NPS score.

«As was seen through 2015/16, the Agency experience, although delivering customer
satisfaction and good wait times, is less likely to lead to advocacy. So, although
lower NPS scores are anticipated from Agency, as reflected by its target, its scores
are still below target.

* The Agency score is lower as it has a greater a greater proportion of Mails
customers than the other segments, 68% vs 53% for Crown and 55% for
WHSmith), with Mails seeing lower NPS scores vs. other products. The
Agency score particularly low for International Mails at +45, vs +71 for Crown
and +69 for WHSmith.

« Agency performs below Crown and WHSmith for all of the pillars of customer
experience excellence, especially Personalisation and Integrity, where scores
are Spp below Network overall.

o Of those customers not scoring 9 or 10 for Integrity, 34% felt that
the member of staff didn’t use a friendly tone of voice, and 31% felt
that they weren't treated in a professional manner.

© Of those customers not scoring 9 or 10 for Personalisation, being
friendlier is the most popular area for improvement.

= By product:
Passport customers show the highest levels of advocacy, with NPS at +82. Passport
NPS is actually highest in WHSmith (+90), followed by Crown (+84). However, the
score for Agency are scoring much lower with 67%.

= Looking at the pillars of customer experience excellence, Agency scores much
lower than Network overall across all measures. The lowest relative
performance is for Expectations (-12pp vs Network) and Personalisation
(11pp). The drill down options for the personalisation question again highlight
that friendliness is an issue.

« For Travel Money customers, NPS is also high at +74. Crown and WHSmith both
perform well at +81 and +76 respectively, well ahead of their targets. However, the
score for Agency is +54, which is below its overall NPS target of +59.

= The Pillar measures for Travel Money in Agency branches are performing
below the network however are performing better than the agency total for
all visit reasons. The Expectations score (i.e. meeting customers’
expectations) is 7pp lower than the Network.

«For Mails, NPS is lower at +66 at a Network level. All segments perform well vs. their
overall NPS targets: Crown is at +71, followed by WHSmith at +65 and Agency at
+60.

« Customer Satisfaction — at 84%, we achieve target for customers extremely/very satisfied
«By segment:

= Crown shows the strongest performance, with 90% of customers extremely/very
satisfied, 3pp ahead of its target. This is followed by WHSmith at 84%, hitting its
target, then Agency at 77%, 5pp below its target.

= By product:

* Passport - which represents 7.4% of VOC respondents - sees the highest score (93%
of customers extremely/very satisfied). Both Crown and WHSmith drive this, with
scores of 95% and 91% respectively, higher than these segments have performed for
either Mails or Travel Money. For Agency the score is lower with 80%, broadly
consistent with the other major visit reasons.

« There are however a smaller proportion of respondents visiting Agency
branches for their passport applications than in Crown and WHSmith (Crown
~- 10% of respondents are Passport customers, WHSmith - 11%, Agency -
2%).

«For Travel money Customer Satisfaction is at 89%. Crown continues to be the highest
performing segment at 92%, again followed by WHSmith at 86%, then Agency at
81%. As previously stated, there appear to be some issues with meeting customers’
expectations,

«Mails customers continue to demonstrate the lowest levels of Customer Satisfaction
(85% across the Network). With Mails the most common reason people visit
branches (58% of VOC responses), it is important that we get this right. Crown again
come out as the best performing segment with 89%, then WHSmith 85% and then
Agency with 80%. We see a smaller variance between segments for Mails than for
other products, meaning that this is a more consistent experience for the customer.

« Wait time acceptable - at a Network level, performance is good, with 92% of customers
agreeing it was acceptable, 3pp ahead of the target of 89%.
= By segment:
« As seen for the other metrics, Crown shows the strongest performance at 93%.
However, on this measure, Agency which has historically seen the best queue times,
is ahead of WHSmith, with scores of 92% and 90% respectively. All segments are 1-
4pp ahead of their respective targets.
= By product:
* For Passports, Wait Time Acceptability is good at 95%, well ahead of the target of
89%. WHSmith performs the best at 96%, followed by Crown (95%) and Agency
(91%).
«For Travel Money, Wait Time acceptability is very good across all three segments:
Crown leads with 97%, followed by Agency and WHS with 95%.
* For Mails, scores are also good, with 92% of customers saying their wait was
acceptable. The score for Crown and Agency is 93% with WHSmith at 88%.

« FS NPS - having seen a very strong P12, sees a 6pt decline in month to +28. This is still
ahead of the 2015/16 full year outturn
* This decline has been driven by a drops across the Savings and Insurance product
ranges:

* For Car/Van Insurance, customers cited issues with servicing and renewals, direct
debits being taken incorrectly, and policy details being incorrect. There was also
more general unhappiness with the larger than expected increase in renewal
prices.

«= For Travel insurance, customer's issues were more about the in-branch
experience. Specifically, applying in branch, wait times and the number of staff
available.

« For Instant Saver/Reward Saver, the main issues were about servicing, in terms
of customers having trouble withdrawing money in branch, and poor service
received when using the call centre. Interest rate was another main driver,
although they are generally poor across the industry.

* For ISA customers, there were issues with transferring funds into the accounts
and general disappointment around the length of time it takes to open the
account and get confirmation it’s live. This may be due to peak ISA period, but
shouldn’t impact customers.

° Other feedback channels
«Social media activity

* The main reasons for consumer social media activity about Post Office remain Wait
times, Staff attitude (some of which is positive) and Opening times, although in lower
volumes than the previous period.

= Given the public nature of social media, they represent more extreme versions of
customers’ views than VOC, but we still see some common themes, i.e. Wait times
and Service/Staff attitude are cited as reasons for dissatisfaction.

* Complaints (NB - because of reporting timings/ processes, complaints numbers and
commentary are based on P12 data)

= Mails - There were 784 complaints in March (690 about Royal Mail transactions, 89
about Parcelforce Worldwide, which equates to 1.3 complaints per 100,000
transactions). This is an increase of 4% compared to the previous month, but 7%
lower than the same period last year. The highest driver in complaints this month
was ‘Incorrect Advice Given / Service Sold’ with 56% of the overall monthly
complaints, and issue unlikely to come through from VOC.

* Government Services - There were 284 complaints in March, stable from the previous
month. An increase in Passports complaints (to 112) is linked to higher volumes,
with HMPO advising that the busy period for applications has extended; For DVLA,
there were 40 complaints, a small increase on the previous period. For POCa,
volumes were stable, with over 80% of the complaints are related to two issues lost
PINs and lost cards, the remaining recorded complaints are processing and handling
issues that have been raised with the POca team, additional training is provided
where necessary. Going forward we should see better analysis of the individual
complaints as extra training has been given to our advisors, this training will be
ongoing over the coming months.

= Telecoms - There were 743 complaints in March, down 14% on March most notably
provisioning (50%) backlogs having been cleared, faults fell to a lesser extent due to
the reduction in provisioning problems. PCA was achieved in March, so complaints
should continue to fall.

* FS and general complaints reporting will be included from P2.

Action plans are in place across all three network segments to address underperformance and seek to
improve scores going forward.

Input required
For GE to review and note.

The Report

Looking Back
WHAT HAS GONE WELL?

e Performance in the first period of the year is good, especially in terms of the in-branch
experience (via Voice of Customer).

o Looking at customers’ comments the most common themes are Staff, Friendliness and
Attentiveness showing how visit the attitude of the staff is to a positive customer
experience, and makes up 49% of comments. The next most common thing customers
are talking about is Speed, showing the importance of valuing customers’ time.

o We see that scores for Travel Money and Passport applications are particularly high,
which is a real positive as we head towards summer where the frequency of these visits
increases.

@ Voice of Customer has successfully migrated to a new platform giving richer, more actionable
data at a branch, segment and network level. For example, we can easily look at scores by
time of day and day of week (as referenced in this report), and also understand common
themes of verbatim feedback. The Insight team will be working closely with the Network and
Product teams to take action from this.

* Network continues to show great focus on customer (and Voice of Customer), seeking to drive
improvements in both the experience and the KPIs. For example:

o Continued high volumes of responses, demonstrating appetite for feedback.

o Detailed, specific customer plans are in place to address underperformers.

o Increase in SSK migration (customers using SSKs) to improve wait time
performance/perception.
© Sharing of best practice, overall, and by individual branches.

WHAT HAS NOT GONE WELL?

« We still see some inconsistency between segments, despite the fact that we are striving for
consistency irrespective of branch type.

« Agency scores are lower than for the other segments, especially for Customer Satisfaction and
NPS. Although Effort perceptions and Wait time acceptability are good in Agency, it appears
that this segment is less likely to be delivering great experiences (i.e. customers being
extremely/very satisfied) or advocacy (i.e. NPS):

co Looking at the comments from we are receiving the same themes are being pulled out
for each segment, however there is a greater stress on speed, 15% compared to 12%
for Network.

o Agency has a much greater proportion of its customers visiting for Mails, which
continue to see lower scores than other products. This contributes to its lower scores
for NPS and Customer Satisfaction.

« We also see inconsistency in the customer experience across the week, with the Effort score
much lower on Sundays, especially at lunchtimes.

+ FS NPS has shown a decline from the previous period, although it is only back to P11 levels.

Looking Ahead
OPPORTUNITIES?

* To further increase Effort scores by focusing on key drivers in branch: Pace, Service,
Experience of Government Services and Environment.

«To focus on areas of underperformance (already being actioned with network colleagues).

* Changes to VOC (including whole network, improvements to the survey and reporting to give
more actionable data and insight) means we can utilise the programme even further to drive
improvement.

e Further integrate customer research (Voice of Customer, FS NPS, and Nunwood) with
Complaints and Social Media to give a more holistic view on the customer experience.

RISKS OR CONCERNS?

* As we go through 2016/17, whether cost pressures will have an impact on the Network's ability
to deliver great customer experience.

« Although we continue to see strong performance when we benchmark against our own
performance, we will continue to monitor scores on the broader customer relationship level
with Nunwood, to help us hopefully improve our position in the Nunwood CEE Index (relative to
other brands).

In Conclusion

We have seen a broadly positive start to customer We need to continue to focus on the customer
performance in the first period of the year. experience throughout the year.

Appendix

We have made some changes to the VOC programme for 2016/17, to improve the experience for both
customers and colleagues. The changes, which are now live, improve the programme, putting it in line
with those of other leading retailers. They give us a customer experience measurement system that is
better able to provide action orientated insights, both at a network and branch level.

POST OFFICE PAGE 6 OF 6

The specific changes we’ve made are:
« Migrating to a new IT platform giving:
o better quality customer data;
© a greater volume of responses (mobile and desktop);
© greater analytical capability to provide deeper customer insights;
© a better survey experience for customers.
« An improved, streamlined questionnaire:
o giving greater focus on diagnosing customers’ issues;
o understanding desired improvements;
o providing a more engaging survey experience for customers;
o with better use of open-ended questions to also help us to better understand the
customer's point of view.
* Changing two of the KPIs:
o moving from Top 3 Box (those Extremely/Very/Fairly Satisfied) to Top 2 Box satisfaction
(those Extremely/Very Satisfied);
© moving from Wait time (% served inside 5 minutes) to Wait time acceptability.
« Reporting VOC based on the whole network in 2016/17

As previously communicated, the changes may in themselves lead to changes in scores, so we will be
reviewing performance and targets during Q1, to adjust if necessary at the end of Q1. The targets in this
report are therefore provisional.

GROUP EXECUTIVE PERFORMANCE UPDATE
Author: Karl Oliver & Mike J Elliott Sponsor: Kevin Gilliland Meeting date: May 2016

Executive Summary

Context
The Period 1 & YTD Sales Performance Report for the General Executive (GE).

Questions this paper addresses

1. How are we trading through a ‘volume’ lens?
2. What are the implications for our outlook and plans?

Conclusion

Mails - Trading income is £0.4m above target (+2%) when stripped of impact of
barcoding income which is £0.3m of target income. Barcoding income will be
backdated following Royal Mail negotiations, with income expected in Q3. Fixed
income is in-line with target.

Financial Services - Continued strong performance for Credit Card, MoneyGram,
Banking and Home & Life Insurance for P1. Mortgage, Savings & Travel have missed
target for the period. Travel and Mortgage have strong Marketing campaigns across
May.

Telco — P1 performance of 70% vs Target is expected to recover through Period 2 & 3
with the “Free, Free, Free” campaign back in place. Early indicators are positive and
we expect to recover volume by the end of Q1.

Government Services (GS) - Continued the strong performance from P12, helped by
the delay in the Government Online Passport service enhancement and strong UKVI
performance.

In summary, P1 performance has broadly followed the trends from Q4 last year.
Strong marketing campaigns for Mortgage and Travel are in place for May and
beyond.

— BT have just announced price rises planned for July 3rd, this has given us a window to further
promote Telecoms products as the differentials between our prices and BT prices has increased
