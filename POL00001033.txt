1.0 Introduction

This document is an addendum to the S75 Release Note — Deferred Peaks List (CS/REN/026)
detailing those Peaks which remain outstanding once $75 LiNK Cutover (R1) has been
implemented.

Section 2.0 contains Peaks which have been identified since CS/REN/026 was produced and
the S75 Data Centre upgrade prior to undertaking the S75 LiNK Cutover. All Peaks
identified during testing are listed within the appropriate test reports; this section gives an
abbreviated description of Peaks which impact, or may impact, on business operation.

was created on TES, but in 5 of the 9 cases
the El message was not created. In the same 5
cases the

corresponding E2 journal message was not
harvested from NPS to TES.

It suggests that there may be some form of memory
overflow / corruption that occurs while processing the
El part of the E1/CO message, due to which the
program health-check & control indicators are being
corrupted that results in the error going undetected
and the logical batch being marked as processed.

Code has been amended to ‘shore up’ memory
structures wherever possible.

In accessing the TES DB on the main host
SSC users have a default profile pointing at
