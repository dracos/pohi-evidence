Penny,

I've looked in detail at what happened on 4th/5Sth Jan 2006 at branch 107026.

User JHO001 was logged onto counter 1 all evening of 4th Jan, doing various activities associated with balancing, and started to product a
balance report at 23:38.

User JKI001 was logged onto counter 2, where some other balancing activites took place (in the same stock unit) but logged out at 22:43, after
a currency declaration.

From 00:04 to 2:27 5th Jan, counter 2 generated repeated Riposte lock events. These were caused by a known Riposte problem where, after
a declaration, messages written on another counter could not immediately be copied in.

After Cleardesk reloaded Riposte at 2:27, the problem cleared and counter 2 then had visibility of all messages. Since counter 2 was not in use
while the events were occurring, they had no impact whatsoever on the balance done.

The counter 1 messages were all generated and written as expected.

So these events have in no way contributed to or affected the shortage calculated by the system during the balance.

Both done in the early hours of 5th Jan - I can see the messages in what you've provided but they aren't in a readable format.

I'm 99.9% sure there's no problem (the user was logged in and balancing on counter 1 but the events are on counter 2), but I would
hate to get it wrong.

Hi Anne

Yes, I can, that's no problem, but I'll have to do it tomorrow as I'm working from home today. Will the messagestore for 5 Jan
be sufficient or will I need to retrieve more data?

Kind regards

Penny, could you also extract the balance report and branch trading statement that were produced, using the tool we
provided? I could do it but I'd have to load up the messagestore, and I'm still in the middle of 20 other things.

Penny,

Yes they were doing their balance in the middle of the night.

I haven't got the events spreadsheet for this one, I think Gareth looked at it. Could you forward it to me? - then I can
look at both in conjunction.
