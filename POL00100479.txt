Paula,

Chris has asked me to flag that Second Sight have provided the Working Group with a partial draft of their thematic
report. It is 15 pages long but includes large amounts of direct quotes from our instruction manuals. As with the
individual case reports it contains a number of unsubstantiated assertions and Post Office’s position is absent or poorly

represented.

We are discussing this report at the Working Group tomorrow and will update you after that discussion.

Regards

David
