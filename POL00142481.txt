Dear Mr Morgan,

As requested, you have been supplied with a copy of the transaction log and
event log to enable you to further analyse the cause of the discrepancy of
£1442.83 in your cash account, week 50.

I initiated a further analysis of these logs, which reaffirmed that there is no
evidence of a Horizon created discrepancy.

The Horizon system will not create a discrepancy solely by the user correcting
an error they have previously made, in this specific case reversing an
incorrect remittance out of cheques provided that the cash figure declared is
correct, the cheque figure held in stock is correct and that the remittance out
cheque figure is correct against the physical cheques dispatched to Data
Central - all of which appear to be in order on the Cash Account for week 50.
The cheque figure dispatched to Data Central has since been verified.

My letter to you of 20th January 2004, gave you until 25"" February 2004 to
make good the loss or provide evidence supporting your claim that this
discrepancy was generated by a systems error and not a user error.

As this period has now elapsed could you please provide the evidence to
support your claim or confirm that you have made good the loss. If you are
unable to make good the loss, you may wish to apply to repay in instalments.
Either way I would appreciate an update from you.

Yours sincerely,

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD
