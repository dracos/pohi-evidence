Subject: POL Litigation/Governance - Confidential

Ahead of our call this afternoon this is just to update you that Ken McCall, the SID, has confirmed that, having spoken
to other members of the Board as he deemed appropriate, he does not think it appropriate to take any action in
relation to Tim Parker’s decision-making around the QC’s review in 2015 of POL’s handling of the Horizon complaints.

His rationale is the same as reported previously. Ken believes Tim made a significant error of judgement in accepting
legal advice that the QC’s report and, as a consequence the follow-up work, should not be shared with the Board. But
he has some sympathy with the fact that Tim would have had to take a very strong position against the legal advice at
the initial stage of his tenure to achieve a different outcome. Overall, Ken’s view is that Tim has been a strong force
for positive change at the company while he has been Chairman and it would be unfair/disproportionate to take
action over this specific issue.

I haven’t asked him to put any of this in writing or come in to meet Ministers or officials to discuss, but this is an
option if the decision is to take this further at our call later.
