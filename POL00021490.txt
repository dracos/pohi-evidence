(a)

The Board noted the report, and all actioris were completed.

POLBO05/118 CHAIRMAN’S BUSINESS — POLB(05)96

(a)

Mike Hodgkinson explained that a number of critical issues

would have to be considered at the board meeting in relation to

Card Account and the effect on the Royal Mail funding issue.
The five year plan currently assumed that DWP income from
card account would decrease, but at a manageable rate.
However, subsequent discussions with Government (through
DWP) had made it clear that their intention would now be to
manage down the Post Office® card account customer base

with a target of zero by 2010. As a consequence a £100m
worsening in POL profit would result in year 5;

furthermore; if the.DVVP went ahead with their plans to manage
down Card Account, this would have very'serious implications
for'the rural ‘and social areas of the network. Current
‘understanding was that the Government were moving to firm up
their plans for the way ahead, and it was therefore critical that
Post Office Ltd moved quickly to highlight the implications to
both Royal Mail Group and Government;

Mike Hodgkinson also asked the Board to have in mind the 3
fundamental roles of the Post Office network, which were to

(i) provide.a postal front-end for Royal Mail Group
products;
(ii) distribute Goverment products at the physical ‘face-to-
face’ end;
(iii) sell commercial products.

the Board should also have in mind the current macro economic
background of the retail sector in their discussion. UK
consumers were increasingly turning to the internet to: buy
consumer goods, and many large retailers were now having to
reconsider whether the balance they had struck between ‘bricks
‘and clicks’ was appropriate;

The agenda items discussed at the Board meeting would need
to be considered against:the conceptual framework outlined
above.

David Mills reported the following matters to the Board:

Japan Post: Adam Crozier and David Mills had met the Chief
Executive of Japan Post, Mr Ikuta, who had expressed an
interest in entering into a Joint Venture with a European’
partner. The Japan Post Investment Bank was an huge player
in the Financial Services markets, and it therefore offered
interesting potential. If Royal Mail Group could strike a deal,
there was an opportunity for this potential to be realised.
Graham Halliday commented that Post Office Ltd’s relationship
with Japan Post had historically been positive. The Board
agreed that Brian Goggin would investigate the options;

Financial Inclusion: The Treasury Select Committee had
announced an enquiry on Financial Inclusion: In our submission
to the Inquiry, Post Office Ltd would raise the issue of LINK

“membership and Card Account.

The Board agreed that:

(i) a letter would be send to Mark Higson at the DTI (copied ea

to Geoffrey Norris, James Sassoon and the Office of the:

and the specific issues.

(ii) The DWP would be asked to confirm their position in
writing;

(iii) an additional Board meeting would take place in
January to replace the EC meeting, to consider progress

. in this area;

(iv) Peter Corbett would write a paper for the 10" January
Royal Mail Holdings Board to highlight the issues
involved;

(v) David Miller would seek assistance from the PR team at

“Royal Mail Group to consider the implications.

(d) Car. Tax Renewal: Gordon Steele also reported that the DVLA
intended to launch an online car tax renewal sérvice. As a
result, it had been estimated that renewal volumes at Post
Offices would drop by between 40% and 60%.

(e) Camelot Board: As a result of David Mills leaving the business,
a replacement would be required to sit on the Camelot Board;

SOLVENCY POLB(05)100

(a)

Peter Corbett reported that the key issues in relation to
solvency continued to be to ensure:

(i) profit and cashflow'were at least in line with budget;
(ii) the ‘route map process’ proceeded in line with the
agreed timetable.

Post Office Ltd continued modestly to exceed its profit target
and more clearly'to exceed its cash target;

sustained solvency would be dependent on a refinancing
agreement being reached, as set out in the interim funding

‘agreement signed at the previous year end;

the key focus for the plan would be to deliver a sustainable
commercial business by Year 5 (2010/11), and included:

(i) a PBIT of over £50m;
(ii) cashflow positive;

(iii) commercial ROCE or commercial segment;

(iv) Social segment being funded to profit and cash neutral
by a Social Network Payment contract for services;

(v) breakeven in the Directly Managed Branches and Urban.
Deprived segments.

the latest version of the plan incorporated feedback from the
Group Chief Executive, and had been reviewed in outline by the
Royal Mail Holdings Board. An updated plan would be
presented to the Royal Mail Holdings Board on 10" January;

a revised timetable had been agreed for the overall Group plan,
including the Post Office Ltd Plan, which targeted the end of
February for agreement on all the key points to allow funding
documentation to be concluded by the‘Year end. The key points
were as follows: .

(i) a Social Network Payment in the form of a contract for
services would be essential — value £100m p.a. from
April 2008 under the “Natural Attrition” scenario;

(ii) further funding of £300m would be required. This was
currently the subject of detailed discussions with the
Shareholder Executive;

(iii) the key outstanding risk was the fiiture of the Card

: Account post 2010 and the £100m per annum risk this I
represented. Mitigating actions were being worked up, ,
but in the. worst case significant network closures would
be inevitable.

‘subject to the satisfactory conclusion of the above, the Board
agreed that Post Office Ltd continued to be solvent.

a further key issue was that state aid clearance for the SNP
extension from 2006-08 had not yet been obtained. This would
need to be delivered within the same timescales;

without a. funding solution the. company-will have less than 12
months funding in April 2006 — and therefore this subject would
be the key focus of the February Board meeting.

POLB05/135 CARD ACCOUNT STRATEGY POLB(05)112

(a) The Board noted the paper. Graham Halliday emphasised the
following additional matters to the Board:

(b) - assuming a static state of 4.2m cards, Post Office Ltd’s annual
net contribution was c£80m. However, given Government's
intention-to wirid down card account, this would clearly not be
sustainable. It was therefore essential that work continued to
influence Government activity, whilst maintaining as large a
share of the current customer base for Post Office Ltd as
possible, and contribution through alternative products;

(c) The effect of an £80m loss of net contribution would have
serious implications for the current plan, and would affect the
due diligence of the proposal being considered by Royal Mail to
sell a 20% stake in the company to its employees;

(d) work continued with the Bank of Ifeland.on a Prepaid card, but

the initial interest expressed by POFS was waning because of
the expense and resources required;

The Board agreed that:

(i) alternatives would be explored with Government, which
would include the possibility of offering Post Office Card
Account.at half of the current price, subject to
investigation;

(ii) Gordon Steele and Crispin Beale would provide the next
Board meeting with the latest market research in this
area;

(iii) Peter Corbett would determine the number of branch
closures that would result from the loss of income, and
write a appropriate paper for the Royal Mail Holdings
Board on January 10th.

(iv) Gordon Steele would investigate the viability of a dual
currency card which used 2 magnetic strips.

(v) Discussions with the DWP could continue to.explore the
" way forward, but they would be advised of Post Office
Ltd’s intention to write regarding the impact on the
branch network. Post Office Ltd would be reluctant to

take the risk inherent of any contractual buy-out.

The Board noted bd report, and also noted that:

Service: The project to improve the recruitment process for
subpostmasters, and temporary subpostmasters was
progressing well. In Directly Managed branches, ten
refurbishments had been completed, security upgrade and
ventilation projects are being progressed and the new.
careerwear contract with Dimensions was in place. Work was
taking place with Property Holdings and the cleaning
companies to improve the standards in 122 branches where
identified improvements were required. David Flowers had
personally visited some of our worst sites;

Network Compliance and Conformance: A major piece of work. .

was underway to ensure that Post Office Ltd would achieve
compliance with the requirements of'the new Postcomm
Licence.

Crown Strategy: the forecast for this financial year stood at "45"
at an average steady-state benefit of £150k per annum per
branch. In terms of engagement by major high street retailers,
Boots had agreed to a trial of six branches on a hosted
("concession franchise") basis. This was a new approach, but
may be part of the answer to franchising large city centre
locations: The WHSmith ahd Woolworths Executive Boards had
also agreed, in principle, to trials, subject to acceptable deals
being struck.

Agents Pay Round 2005: The latest projection from Finance
confirmed that the likely outturn was below £525m for year end
as per the original plan. Final outturn will depend on sales
performance.

(b) Service Specification Programme: Christmas services this year
would be a test for the fleet mix, generated as a result of the
revisions and cost reduction measures. The big issue would be.
whether the move from armour to soft skin and the resultant
loss in coin carrying capacity when coupled with RTR would
cause service tension, during this critical retailing period.

(c) Cags Strategy: Plans shared with the staff associations, the
frontline managers & staff and external customers. A period of
consultation is: now in progress. The CWU fundamentally
oppose the proposal to exit the external Cash in Transit market
and have prepared counter proposals.

POLB05/143 HUMAN RESOURCES REPORT POLB(05)120
(a) The Board noted the report and in addition that:

Conversions: The four conversions announced this week had
caused some anger from the CWU leadership, and ballots. for
industrial action were expected at these Directly Managed
Branches. The six conversions due to be announced on 6"
December would almost certainly initiate ballots for industrial

action. The earliest.any official industrial action could take place #
would be 28 December, although it was more likély to take bel
place in late January. Two of the six Directly Managed #
Branches, Dumfries and Irvine, had collocated with the RMUK .
sorting offices and there was the possibility of unofficial wildcat ae
industrial action. Gareth Evans had been supportive of the . 6
Company's situation. The large surplus that could result from 2
this exercise would be challenging to manage. .

(b) Have. Your Say: ‘I enjoy working here’ (IEWH) was down 3%
against last year — currently at 60%. Overall scores for Directly
Managed Branches were once again poor this month, with
IEWH down 11% compared to last November — this year
scoring 53%. Working Parties continued to focus on key issues
such as: facilities (all segments), sales.culture, and the future
for Cash Services.

(c) Headcount: Headcount reduced by 91 in November which
brought the annual total to 458 lower this year. This was well
ahead of plan. Full Time Earners were down by 119 (200 better
than target) which reflected the fall in overtime, casual and
agency staffing. Surplus numbers stood at 106, but solutions
were already in place for 50 of these cases. Staff Experiditure
had been brought back on Budget.
