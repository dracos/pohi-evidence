: RE: REGINA v SEEMA MISRA GUILDFORD CROWN COURT
TRIAL - W/L 1ST - 12TH JUNE 2009 CASE NO: POLTD/0708/0249

Dear Phil,

I have spoken to Jon Longman about this case. The case for theft is strong and we
should not accept the pleas. Confiscation would also be a non-starter if we did. Jon is
making some further enquiries about the "thieves" the Defence have given us details for.
It may be that we have been given false details which may stengthen our case.

Do call on f-. if you would like to discuss further.

Warwick

Hi Warwick,

1am just a little bit in the dark about Misra. You will recall that there

is one count of theft and some false accountings. The Defence will plead

Guilty to the false accountings and Jon Longman is fairly happy for us to
accept those pleas. However we are some 70 odd thousand pounds light at the
moment as I understand it and if we just accept the false accountings it is
very difficult for us later to obtain a Confiscation Order and subsequently
compensation out of the Confiscation.

Could you let me have your views on this. I would be very grateful to hear
from you.

Best Wishes.
Phil Taylor
