Mark/Martin

A draft reply to the attached case is due on 23 October. In considering how best to respond, it would
be helpful to know of any recent contacts there might have been between POL and JFSA, Stephen
Mosley and Mr Griffiths' family over this tragic case, and of any wider relevant background.
