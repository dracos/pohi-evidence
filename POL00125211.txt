Hi Brian

I suspect (though I do not know) that Chris/Angela and John have not inputted into the document which will have come
exclusively from CK. I also doubt that Jarnail explained to them about Chris' views.

I think that Chris will be happy for you to consider further changes based on CK's comments provided that the policy
doesn't go back to being mechanistic (1 don't see a risk of this).

My view is that to ensure we get sign off from everyone, once we get your comments and amends we have a final
conference with you and all the relevant people at POL (this can include CK). Otherwise I don't think Chris will give it
much thought.

Do you agree?

Kind regards

Gavin

Don't worry. It's an occupational hazard!

I've just taken a few minutes to skip through the email and attachment out of curiosity. I see that the comments are
all CK's and have been sent up the line by Jarnail, though Chris is copied in.

Bearing in mind I effectively trashed CK's "mechanistic" effort (which I had been comfortable with) given our con with
Chris I am slightly concerned about any push back from the "real world" version I deliberately drafted. Also lam
unclear if CK were privy to Chris's views and have therefore been piqued by the version I've produced in place of
theirs.

I thought I'd get this preliminary email out to you asap as I think I/we will need some steer. Is Chris do you think
happy for me to consider and if need be insert further changes based on CK's comments?

Has there been any input to document that you know about from Chris or Angela who attended our meeting at More
Place, or for that matter from John (HoS)?

Regards

Brian

Thanks.

I wish I could be enjoying the sunshine but I'm not! I will need some time on this I am afraid as I am embarking on a
heavy duty case on Monday and am spending all my time on this right now and may be doing so for the next 2 weeks
or so. That said, I'll get to this as soon as I can.

What kind of turnaround does POL want on this?

I hope all is well with you and you are enjoying the sunshine.
Please find attached and below an email from Jarnail attaching CK comments on the draft prosecution policy.

I'm not sure of the best way forward. I suspect if you could respond to CK's comments that would be a good start. If
there are differences of approach we could pick them up in a telephone conference later on.

Kind regards

I have received the draft prosecution policy drafted by BAQC.

It appears to give POL complete discretion as to how proceed in any prosecution case. However it also appears to be
little vague for that reason. It contains less detail then the draft prepared by CK. May I suggest I forward it to CK for
their views as they will ultimately be advising and prosecuting in accordance with the POL prosecution policy .
Regards

Jarnail.

Jarnail
Please find attached Brian Altman QC's first draft prosecution policy for your review.
I set out below his comments to me which need some thought and input from POL.

1. In light of our discussions with Chris, particularly his perfectly understandable wish for a "real
world" rather than mechanistic, legalistic type policy document, I have (as we discussed some days
ago) gone for a far more (I hope) user-friendly document than that originally drafted by CK. Indeed, it
(and the title which I have readily adopted) takes the emphasis off criminal prosecution and focuses
on the means of enforcement which may (but not inevitably) include prosecution. In my view this fits
POL's requirements.

2. While the Beachcroft example was good I felt it far too wordy and over-inclusive for what is
required and it incorporated too much unnecessary information.

3. If the policy is to be published then it needs to inform as well as be JR proof. Essentially the
attached describes (1) to whom it applies (2) the underlying need for POL enforcement action (3) the
options available to it (4) when non-criminal action might be deployed (5) the basic principles of
criminal enforcement (incorporating by reference the CPS Code and defining the 2 stage test) (6)
when criminal enforcement will be deployed (7) who makes the decision (8) the recovery of money
and (9) review.

In particular:
1. At para 1.4.1 I hope I have accurately described (and may be permitted to describe) the BIP which
Angela and Chris agreed is designed to identify problems and direct intervention.
2. At para 4.3 and 7.3 to 7.4 I have written in a very wide ambit of discretion for POL decision-makers
but have emphasised the ‘Option B' factors/approach approved by the Board without being
prescriptive about any one factor and without including any cut-off financial figure (as we all agreed).
3. At para 4.4 have added in the 'safeguard" I was asked for. I have left it broad enough not to tie
POL's hands about other enforcement options.
4. Section 5 (based inevitably on the Beachcroft document which Jarnail tells us was written on
instructions) I have simplified.
5. As for section 8, I have done what I can on current instructions. I have left it deliberately simple. It
may be that the team names are wrong. If so they can easily be corrected.

At para 8.2 I thought that the Head of Security would be more likely to have the power to disagree with the
POLCT senior lawyer than an investigation officer (as was Jarnail's suggestion in the email last week).
Again if this is wrong then it can be changed. Either way the decision tree set out in the Security Team's
policy document (referred to at para 8.4 and footnote 3) and the decision making hierarchy in the text of
that document will require revision according to any new decision tree

Can I suggest that once you have reviewed it we meet up to go through any comments you have before
finalising the document.
