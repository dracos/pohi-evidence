Yee Posrbon,

On 13 January 2015 your Head of Public Affairs wrote to me offering a meeting to discuss
my constituent Jo Hamilton's case. I found it disappointing that I heard from him and not
you, He did not answer the points I had made in my letter to you about the various respects
in which you had broken the agreement you had made with me and other MPs and in which
the Mediation Scheme was not working as we all had intended.

Having discussed this offer with my constituent and her advisor, I have decided to decline it.
I cannot see the point of it and I particularly do not care to discuss what is a legal matter
with a public relations man. More importantly, given that you have refused to allow the
independent investigators access to the documents they need to assess her case, whatever
conclusions you as CEO have reached to my mind rest on very shaky ground.

I am confident that this will be put to the test in the months ahead.
