All
This is obviously a disappointing decision by Tony. A couple of thoughts from me:

1. Tony's analysis is logically incorrect. The phrase “/f your case is suitable and you provide accurate, detailed
information to Second Sight, then this [mediation] is likely in most circumstances” imposes two pre-conditions
to mediation. First that the case is suitable and second that the Applicant provides detailed information.
Mediation is only "likely in most circumstances" if the pre-conditions are first met. Tony cannot therefore
simply dismiss these pre-conditions as he has done in his decision. To be honest, I'm astonished by the
sloppiness of Tony's analysis.

2. I'm not sure what Tony means in the last paragraph by "any admission as to wrongdoin; .] made in
circumstances where the admission was not made voluntarily". For example, would this include the situation

where an Applicant plea bargains and admits to false accounting in order to avoid a theft charge? If so, then
Tony's decision will result in practically all the criminal cases being recommended for mediation.
