HNGxX Live Issues Impacting Multiple Branches Fujitsu

™ Further Branch Database hanging incidents affecting many/all branches on
6, 9", 16" 28" April and 7", 12" & 13" May. Multiple minor occurrences.

@ In addition - 5 out of 20 BAL OSRs went into a loop on 28" April, resulting in
longer outage than previous incidents. Cause - change contained in release
1.21 that was applied to live 25th April. Fix tested & implemented into live

4" May.

5" May — 40 minute HNG-X outage caused by human error

Diagnostic tracing and Oracle Streams switched on in live by agreement
with POL from 11" May to enable new occurrences of LCK error to be
captured with full diagnostic data. Cannot be replicated on Vol rig.

= Full diagnostics captured 12 May 17:40 & 13" May 09:00 and sent to
Oracle.

@ Escalations to Oracle Exec level. 3 recommendations from Oracle:-

POLSAP Apps Exec Summary FUJITSU
= Implementation:
m Issues with the file format extracts provided by CSC are causing issues
for Test Cycle 3 data loads. The new set of extracts has now been

provided and there are no further issues. Data quality checking needs to
complete by 21/5 and POL looking at mitigating impact of delays

m A further low-level planning session has been arranged for cutover
= Awaiting scope of functional testing from POL
m CAT/CMS:

m POL are no longer confident of meeting the planned date for completion
of CAT. There are a number of outstanding test scripts to run, and a
number of defects to close. A plan is in place to address the outstanding

defects as a priority

m The pricing change relating to CMS will not require a change control.
However, POL acceptance of the fix is still outstanding

@ Training:

mu The CR for the POLSAP Training Environment has been approved by
CCB and will be issued to POL

AEI Key Risks & Issues FUJITSU

m Risks:
mu Milestone dates at risk if information is not released by POL within the
agreed 36 working days for 150 Branches
mw Scheduling — Geographic Complexity is a risk to delivery
m Large number of Open Issues is a risk to achieving Milestones

m Changes to schedule (removal of Branches, not specifying Branch
Priority) is a risk to achieving Milestones

@ Issues:

Engineering Team not following Work Packages

FS Team stretched to working limit

PO Branches resisting BT and FS Hardware installs

PO Branches do not appear to have working knowledge of solution —
and appear to be re-directing BT Installations
