Attachments: January Options - v7- clean.docx

Hi Tom,
Jess and I are working on something in respect of further detail around mediations.
I have also attached the last options paper we pulled together which should help inform the grid we are doing now?

In terms of costs - realistically the opportunity for choosing an option which saves money has now gone. All (realistic)
options will, broadly speaking, cost similar amounts of money. The only way they will differ is in terms of efficiency and
the exposure each leaves us with to a subsequent litigation process.

However, without clear and agreed working assumptions it is extremely difficult to forecast respective efficiencies.
Though once the Board has agreed a way forward, we can then work up resourcing and timing plans together with
which roles (if any) the existing Scheme mechanisms maintain. With these, I can then work something up that is based
upon these and thus, reliable. Until then, the below really should only be used for ranking purposes — largely because
they do not consider variations in the Scheme duration for each of the option as we just do not know this at the
moment.

As of December 2015 total Scheme spend was £5.6m. I have not got the numbers for January just yet but would assume
the total to now be c.£6m. The below figures assume the Scheme ends in July and all mediations have taken place by
Dec 2015.

The above in mind - in terms of the 5 options set out in the paper:

e¢ Mediate all non-criminal = mediating a further 71 cases. Further spend = c.£2.9m. Therefore total spend =
c.£8.9m

© Mediate all = mediating a further 109 cases. Further spend = c.£3.5m. Therefore total spend =c. £9.5m

e Pay out or pay to litigate. This includes to many variables to be able to forecast (would we force the payment on
those in the Scheme?). Regardless, as this has ( I think) already been dismissed is a costing still necessary?

e Mediate cases with Merit = mediating a further 52 cases (24 already with CEDR + 33% of the remaining 85 cases
in the Scheme). Further spend = c£2.7m. Therefore total spend = c£8.7m

e Status Quo. As Scheme mechanisms (e.g. WG) and scheme duration are not taken into consideration here, the
costs for this option would be similar to that of the option above.

All
Please see the attached in response to Alice’s feedback. Grateful for your views on format.

I’ve had a go a populating one of the options. I’m straying way out of my knowledge especially on TUS and Network
impact but I think it is really important.

Grateful for al thoughts against all options — happy with email or handwritten notes.
Jane / Mel — if there are others you think could contribute please do pass on / let me know
Mark — your input on costs and time would be particularly valuable.

Thanks in anticipation

Tom
