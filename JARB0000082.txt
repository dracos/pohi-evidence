Thanks David

Best number and Paula will be put through to James.

One thing that has come up which he would like to cover is the agenda for the
meeting next week. What has been proposed is as follows:

Welcome and into — JNA for 5 mins

Update on progress with mediation scheme and business improvement programme
— PV for 15 mins

Second Sight update — 10 mins

JFSA update — 10 mins

Q&A — 20 mins

Is Paula content with this? Second Sight have expressed some concern in that they
feel they cannot, and should not, speak on behalf of the Working Group. However,
they can offer their perspective on the investigations. I have spoken to Ian just now
and he understands that it would be inappropriate to go into details given that the
investigations are still works in progress, and that gesturing towards any conclusions
at this stage would not be wise. This would be something it would be very good for
Paula and James to cover.

Let me know if anything else is required.

Kind regards,
Janet

Hi David,

When you're ready, can you confirm that tomorrow's phone call between Paula and
James is OK for 1.30pm, and advise which is the best number to reach Paula on,
please?

Many thanks,
Janet

Let’s say 1:30 — train conversations never work.

James,

Paula wants a 10 minute chat, if possible on Tuesday 18 March, about the meeting
on 24 March. She can do anytime between 12,30 and 3pm. You are at Wilton Park
until 12.30, then travelling back, arriving Victoria at 1pm, then Cttee at 2. Might you
be able to talk either on the train or at, say, 1.30?

Many thanks
Janet
