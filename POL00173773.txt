If you contact Panorama, would it not be apparent to them that I had passed on their

details, would look bad.

I will speak to them tomorrow,]I will be very clear that the system is robust,but that we need to be
better and more consistent when responding to claims of Horizon faults.In addition I will say
better training is required.

If we are not careful these Horizon shenanigans will turn into a cottage industry.

Very Best

George

Hi both — Matt has been contacted by a producer at BBC
Panorama (contact details below), which is considering running
a programme on the Horizon / Justice for subpostmasters issue.

To inform their decision on whether to run with the programme
or not, he’s keen to talk to someone at the NFSP in more detail
about our take on the issue, and about our experience of
Horizon more broadly.

I don't feel confident enough in my knowledge of the system to
do this. Therefore, would one of you be willing to talk to him?

I understand from Matt that he'd ideally like to talk to us today or
tomorrow.

Many thanks
Paul
