Mediation Scheme, that is important to the
business and we are embracing the risks to try
and deal with this in a positive way.

2. We must be conscious of the impact of the

BC to relay above messages from PV to
workshop attendees.

DO took the SG through the key case highlights.
13% of case questionnaires submitted therefore the
investigators’ workload is going to increase rapidly.
They will have 4 weeks to complete the
investigation. 18 cases are currently under PO
investigation and 2 cases are with Second Sight.
Emerging issues:

challenge and improve.

Second Sight and the WG Chair in terms of the
investigation report. CA is chairing a workshop on
18 December to look at how we might develop the
content of our investigation reports to satisfy the
Chair and Second Sight to ensure an appropriate
outcome at mediation. The need to have a plan for
