Subject: PinlCLs agreed for Futures
Attachment: Futures021003.zip

I am sending to you two versions of the Futures spreadsheet. Version 1.2 we
discussed at Friday's meeting last week, I only brought a printed copy to
the meeting and forgot to distribute it. Version 1.3 is an up-to-date copy
with those PinICLs discussed and agreed today and also any which have been
included since the last version. Included in today's version is a new
Bureau PinICL regarding events being generated for RU and RD on a roll over
of a stock unit for Bureau TC. We propose to KEL, so that SSC are aware of
the issue as the problem will only impact the support of the live estate and
target at futures.

In both versions any additions are identified by bold text. Please do
review and let me know if you disagree with those included or require
further information.
