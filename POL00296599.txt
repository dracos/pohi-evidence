I would just make the following points —

-Although we are keen to focus on the horizon issues I am pretty sure that the original scope included process
improvements

-It was originally JA’s request that we included JFSA in the process and he insisted that SS needed to convince JFSA of
the validity of the investigation — if his view has changed it would be helpful to make this clear during the call

-in our conversation with SS today we have agreed that they should finish the spot reviews but that these would also

be complete by end of October.
- the issue re new cases was raised by SS with Janet around end of Feb they have also raised the evidence issue re the
MP’s cases again via Janet.

Updated version of the brief with the changes discussed with Alwen earlier. Have also integrated Mark’s additions.

The structure and sequence reflects what I understand is our expected position with James — i.e, we’re on strong
ground asking him to restrict the number of cases and this should be our first focus; he may be more reluctant to limit
the review to Horizon glitches rather than wider process issues - we should test this, but if that’s the case what we do
need to make absolutely clear that there can be no confusion between the two in the headline conclusions. Alwen — is
that a fair summing up?

Hi Alwen

I've had a look, see attached. I am confused as to whether we are agreeing to the second sight view that they need until end of
October for the full review where they can, or whether we are being firmer and saying they finish after the three cases. Can you
clarify?

Suggest you send to Martin Edwarda as well before Paula. I have added various bits here and sorry they are not in tracking - on
the iPad.

I hope your day hasn't been too grim.

Best wishes
Mark
