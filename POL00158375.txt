Subject: Castleton's counter offer P.O

You will all be pleased to know that the solicitors acting for Castleton
have substantially accepted our counter proposal. I attach a copy of their
letter.

Castleton is not prepared to have judgement entered against him because he
claims it would prejudice his future career prospects and so the claim

will be settled by way of a Tomlin Order. This means that if anybody
searched the Court records all they would see is a record that the claim

was resolved but the detail of the same is kept private.

Castleton is prepared to make an open statement that POL can use as it
chooses exonerating the HORIZON system. I now need your assistance over
the form of wording that POL would like to see in that statement.

I have prepared a short statement but would be very grateful for any
improvements which you can suggest. We need to have a settled form of
words to go back to Castleton's solicitors as soon as possible. This
settlement is still without prejudice and does not formally conclude the
action until it is signed so we must endeavour to get it signed as soon as
possible.

"I Mr L Castleton the former postmaster at Marine Drive Post Office admit
that a sum of money was owed by me to Post Office Ltd as a result of
errors which arose whilst I was the postmaster at the above office. I had
though that this debt arose due to a malfunction of the HORIZON system
but I know accept that I was mistaken and that the debt arose out of human
error. I declare that the HORIZON system did not contribute to the errors

in any way and formally withdraw all statements I made to the contrary."
