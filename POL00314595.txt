Subject: CCRC S17 requests for sub-postmaster applications

Dear Mr Cooke and Mr Stuart,

Further to my correspondence on 2 April 2015 and telephone conversation with Mr Cooke earlier today, I am
conscious that the s.17 notices sent to us by the CCRC ask Post Office to provide responsive documents and other
materials to you within 28 days.

We have of course already provided to you some materials in response to “general” s.17 notices (i.e. those which do
not relate to a specific case). In that regard, I anticipate sending to you tomorrow the final “Briefing Report — Part
Two” prepared by Second Sight, along with Post Office Limited’s Reply to that report, as promised in my letter dated 2
April 2015. I will at the same time provide to you, as requested in Mr Cooke’s email of 13 April 2015, the draft Report
dated 11 March 2015 and draft Reply dated 27 March 2015 referred to in my 2 April 2015 letter.

We are also making progress in collating the documents and materials sought in the “case specific” s.17 notices, for
which the first of the 28 day periods expires today. As I intimated in my 2 April 2015 email, responding to these
notices is proving to be a considerable exercise, given the number of applicants (currently 18), breadth of the
requests, and likely volume of material. Further, the documents and materials are physically held in a variety of
locations and may not easily be retrieved given the age of some of the cases. As such, although we are working to
provide the requested documents and materials as quickly as possible, I do not anticipate that we will be able to do so
within the 28 day periods as you have asked.

I have been liaising with Mr Stuart about meeting to discuss how we can respond to the s.17 notices in a way which
best facilitates your review. We think that it would be useful to discuss the following at such a meeting:

- Background to the Complaint Review and Mediation Scheme established to consider individual concerns
about the Post Office Horizon system (given that the majority of the applicants to the CCRC also applied to
this Scheme);

- Categories of Responsive Documents and Materials;

- Delivery to CCRC of Documents and Materials:

o Time frame;

o Sequence of delivery;

o Method of delivery (e.g. given the anticipated volume of documents, we are currently considering
whether a “data room” would be helpful, but obviously need your input on whether this would
produce a suitable solution);

- Points of Contact.

We will make ourselves available for this meeting if you could please let me know when you would be available. We
are happy to host you at our offices in London or to travel to your offices in Birmingham if you would prefer.

I look forward to hearing from you. In the meantime, we are continuing to collate the documents and materials we
are required to provide under the various s.17 notices.

Kind regards, Rodric
