Thank you for your letters of 25 February and 20 March seeking a meeting
with me to discuss the concerns of the Justice for Sub Post Masters Alliance
(JFSA) about Post Office Ltd’s (POL) Horizon system and the survey of
serving subpostmasters recently conducted by your organisation. I apologise
for the delay in replying.

As you are aware from your contacts with my predecessor, Ed Davey, the
concems raised by the JFSA relate to operational and contractual matters for
POL and, as the shareholder, Government has an arm's length relationship
with the company and does have any role in its day to day operations. I also
understand that legal action against POL is under way in behalf of a number
of JFSA members.

Taking into account that any meeting would take place within this overall
ask you to contact my Diary Manager, Marzena Bujalska, on
if you would still like to arrange a suitable date.
