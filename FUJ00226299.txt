Hi Amanda,

Here's a preview of the document, which Suzie has now been promised to Post Office for mid-morning tomorrow!

T hope you can take a look ASAP, and that you'll conclude that it's OK to release, with the addition of some suitable
commercial boilerplate text?

(Latoya - Your review is also welcome, but it might be worth comparing notes with Amanda as part of the review.)

Thanks in advance!
