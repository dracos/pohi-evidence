Agree with legal recommendation to proceed.

Colin,

With reference to the offenders comments in your report:

“Mr Hedges blames the Horizon system for the losses in his branch but it has been
proved that this was not the case”.

.. although the evidence clearly suggests otherwise and as such may not be mentioned again, please
ensure we keep an eye on this as the case progresses, more so if it becomes yet another potential
‘Horizon Integrity’ challenge via his defence. Proceed as per the norm but keep me informed if this
gets raised.

Jason,

Horizon Integrity is an agenda item for the SLT Thus/Fri. We can discuss thereafter as it would be
useful to provide an update to the fraud team on the current state of play and to ensure they are all
kept in the loop.

Thanks,

Andy
