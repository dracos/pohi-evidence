PM is stil having problems with the gateway. PM called to advise that the magnetic card reader and the barcode stopped working today. Pm solved the problem by logging out then logging
back into the system, Pm cannot remember what the magnetic card was but the barcoded bill was a BT bill. PM also informed me that the gateway was rebooted yesterday, and twice on
wednesday (screen froze - no egg timer movement - during a balancing)
