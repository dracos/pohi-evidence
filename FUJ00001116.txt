SUMMARY and REASON FOR CHANGE:

As a consequence of the expiry of the Engineering Service provided by Fujitsu, it has
been agreed that changes to the HNG-X Agreement relating to the provision of the
Services are necessary and the terms set out in this Change Control Note (CCN)
shall apply to amend the HNG-X Agreement from the date of expiration of the
Engineering Service.

This CCN1423c sets out the changes necessary to remove the obligations relating to
and to remove references to the Engineering Service from the HNG-X Agreement
and to detail the changes necessary to the other Services, to enable the continued
provision of the remainder of the Services under the Agreement. This CCN1423c
also details the adjustments to the Charges within the Agreement to reflect the
changes that are being made to the Services as a result of the expiration of the
Engineering Service.

This CCN1423c has been drafted in terms of the make good changes to the retained
Services, based on the requirements as specified within the Atos owned document

entitled

SIAM Service Management - Engineering Transition Baseline Requirements -

v1.0 (REQ/CUS/TRQ/2736).

The expiration of the Engineering Service, and the implementation of similar services
from the Next Supplier, may result in increases to the volume and complexity of
Incidents. It is agreed by the parties that, in the event of increases in the volume of
activity or other Service impacts which affect Fujitsu’s ability to perform the Services
and which are attributable to the termination of the Engineering Service, this shall be
managed in accordance with the HNG-X Agreement and in particular, Clause 39.

DETAILS OF CHANGE:

This CCN1423c provides for:

1)
2)

3)

4)

5)

6)

7)

The expiry of the Engineering Service at 23:59 on the 31st March 2015;
The amendment of certain related definitions and references to the
Engineering Service within the Agreement;

The remedial changes necessary to the scope of the Service Management
Service, Management Information Service, Security Management Service,
Branch Network Service and Communications Management Team Service to
enable the continued and uninterrupted provision of such Services (once
fully implemented) and to reflect changes to process;

An adjustment to the Charges within Schedule D1 (Charges) in respect of
resulting reductions in Fujitsu Services cost incurred in the delivery of the
Management Information Service, Service Management Service and Security
Management Service as a result of impacting the remaining Services (in
accordance with paragraph 9 of Schedule E) on the expiry of the
Engineering Service. Fujitsu has agreed to waive any partial termination
charge it may have been entitled to. This does not constitute a variation to
the terms of the Agreement with respect to future partial terminations
hereafter.

Whilst this CCN1423c caters for amendments to the Charges for the Service
Management Service, for the avoidance of doubt, it is noted that these are
incremental to those changes previously agreed within CCN1409a and which
specifically related to the amendments to the MAC team scope.

Anew monthly Charge within Schedule D1 (Charges) in respect of the
continued operation of the Dispatch 1 system used by the Engineering
Service, until CT1840 is approved and decommission of the Dispatch 1
system is completed.

The transfer of certain equipment and assets from Fujitsu Services to the
Post Office in order for Post Office to obtain the provision of services similar
to the Engineering Service after the expiry of the provision of the
Engineering Service, in accordance with the Transfer of Assets Agreement
dated 21st August 2015 herewith attached at Attachment 1 (“Asset Transfer

“Until 31°! March 2015, Fujitsu Services shall monitor the actual numbers of
Branches and Counter Positions in each year against the figure in Annex A of
Part 1 of Schedule D1 for that year for the purpose of assessing the likelihood

Office. In normal circumstances, the variation between the measured trend
and the assumed trend for an item of Equipment will be sufficiently consistent
over time to allow a replacement programme (if that is necessary) to be
developed and carried out in an economic manner as part of a planned and
orderly routine. It is possible, however, that an item of Equipment might, other
than by reason of an act or omission of Fujitsu Services, begin to fail in such
quantities that Fujitsu Services and Post Office reasonably consider that the
Equipment needs to be replaced or repaired outside the normal routine
(‘Catastrophic Failure’).”

CCD SVM/SDM/SD/0011 — Branch Network Service Description

An amended version of SVM/SDM/SD/0011 Branch Network Service Description
has been included as Attachment 3. This document will go through the document
review and approval process but this new version will be effective 1st April 2015.
In the event there are any further changes to this document required then this will
be managed under the normal Change Control Procedure. The updates reflect
the expiry of the Engineering Service by making changes to definitions of Counter
Availability and Branch Availability, and the methods of calculating their
associated Service Level Targets, to recognise the changes in scope of services
being provided by Fujitsu Services.

CCD SVM/SDM/SD/0007 — Service Management Service: Service Description:

The following amendments are required to detail the changes in obligations and
responsibilities, as part of the Release Management Service, in respect of
releasing Counter Gold Builds to the Next Supplier of branch hardware
engineering services;
* Add the following definitions within the table in Section 0.6
Abbreviations/Definitions;

EUC Tower I The Next Supplier of branch hardware engineering services, in place of
Provider the expired Fujitsu provided Engineering Service.

Counter Base Unit I The PC element of the Counter Equipment

Counter Gold Build I A compiled set of operating system, driver and application system
code which can be installed onto a Counter Base Unit, upon which the
main application system code, and subsequent patches and changes,
can be applied. Occasionally, new Counter Gold Build versions may
be created, either as the only way that required change can be
released, or with the aim of reducing the volume of subsequent
updates required for a new or replaced Counter to build to the
appropriate software version.

Add an additional responsibility for Post Office to plan the timings of
Counter Gold Build releases and to request them, using the Change
Control Procedure (as an additional sub-section within 3.1.1.3 Release
Distribution Timing and in section 4.1.3 Post Office Dependencies and
Responsibilities)

Add a clarification on the Service's obligations that it will test any new
Counter Gold Build version to be released, only to the point of verifying
that it can be successfully installed on a Counter Base Unit; and add a
responsibility on the EUC Tower Provider to test that their Counter Gold
Build duplication and installation processes and mechanisms can perform
an effective Counter Gold Build install (as an additional sub-section within
3.1.1.4 Release Testing)

Add an additional obligation to release new versions of Counter Gold

Builds to the EUC Tower Provider, to agreed timescales; add an
additional responsibility on Post Office (or their nominated managing
agent) to manage the EUC Tower Provider's release of the Counter Gold
Build under change control, to agreed timescales; and add an additional
responsibility on the EUC Tower Provider to manage the further release of
the Counter Gold Build version onto Counter Base Units in a timely
manner, whether it is to be used as part of a Release or for installations
on new or replaced Counter Base Units (as an additional sub-section
within 3.1.1.7 No Disruption to Users and the Working Environment)

The obligation to deal with requests for adding, updating or removing Global User
accounts (in Section 5.1 MAC Team Core Activities within Annex C) will be
updated to clarify that all requests will come from Post Office, will have been
authorised before receipt and will include requests for accounts for Postmasters,
Post Office Trainers and EUC Tower Provider engineers.

The existing obligations of the MAC Team related to administering and managing
Engineering activities (all obligations contained within Section 5.2 MAC Team
Engineering Activities) will be removed on 31% March 2015.

There will be additions made to describe the responsibilities of the MAC Team
around receiving Incidents related to providing network or application
configuration support (as defined in the first section of attachment 1 to
CCN1409a) to engineers of the EUC Tower Provider making on-site Counter
Hardware break-fix visits. When receiving these Incidents they will be classified
with Severity Level 1 and their resolution will aim to meet the following service
level targets;

It should be noted that charges for the MAC team have not been uplifted by this
CCN1423, since the above responses have been designed as automated
responses.

This CCN is based upon the following assumption:

The test rigs (comprising the following elements);

1. Solution Verification & Integration (SV&I Rig)

2. Integration (INT Rig)

3. Component Integration Testing (CIT Rig)

4. Live System Test (LST Rig)

5. Reference Data Test (Ref Data Rig);

units and end user peripherals) which as a consequence of the Exit of the
Engineering Service on 31% March 2015 Fujitsu will no longer have the spares or
repair facilities to support. In the event that there are failure(s) on this hardware
during the remaining period of providing these facilities, Fujitsu will raise new
Incident(s) with Post Office Ltd’s Service Desk for the attention of the Next Supplier
of the Engineering Service to attend the Fujitsu test locations to replace the failed
part(s). It is agreed that this support will be provided by Post Office Ltd at no cost to
Fujitsu. Fujitsu will exercise reasonable care and skill in accordance with its own
established internal procedures when housing and/or using the Branch Infrastructure
to perform the Services.
