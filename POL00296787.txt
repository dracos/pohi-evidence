Thanks Jarnail.
Can you please ask Rob what he means by “a Horizon prosecution case”?

Is it some sort of definition which differentiates them from other cases? If so, what are the criteria for being a “Horizon
prosecution case”?

Thanks, Rodric

Subject: URGENT - Second Sight Investigation

Jarnail,
For the Briefing Note we are preparing for the Chairman and CEO, can you please find out today whether:

- we had any convictions pre-Separation based solely on Horizon (ie there were no other contributing factors such as a
paper trail, money in a bank etc).Yes there is always some other evidence .

- we were able to defend Horizon when challenges were raised to it in pre-Separation prosecutions. Yes have never lost
a Horizon prosecution case

Given that "pre-Separation" is a pretty long period (!), we could limit it to the length of time we keep the physical
prosecution files, or if we keep those forever, say to cases since 2000. Once prosecution papers are archived with lron
POL00296787
POL00296787

mountain they are then kept for 7 years.
I assume you'll need to speak to Rob Wilson (I think) at RM for this?

Thanks for your help.
