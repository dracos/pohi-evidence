(TC: 00:02:51)

Adrian Morris: Okay, that's fine. Um, we've had a short break there while we've changed the tapes
over, signed and sealed them. Any time during the break of tapes, have either myself or my
colleague asked you any questions in relation to this enquiry?

(TC: 00:03:04)

(TC: 00:03:05)

Adrian Morris: Oh yeah. At the end of the last tape, we were talking about, um, we spoke about
the £10,000, how you, Joan and yourself counted it up and you took the money out to these family
and friends that were out in the car. Um, and we were talking about the £20,000, £20,000 that you
handed over in June stroke July. Now, we got as far as saying, I believe, that you had spoken to
Jude about it, she wasn't happy.

Oyeteju Adedayo: She wasn't, because obviously she knows that it's the Post Office money, and she
knows I' ve never done it, never in all my days.

(TC: 00:03:51)
Adrian Morris: No, can we, we have because you've done it a month before.

(TC: 00:03:53)
Oyeteju Adedayo: No.

(TC: 00:03:53)
Adrian Morris: You took ten thousand the month before, didn't you?

(TC: 00:03:54)
Oyeteju Adedayo: I know, I know but, it wasn't with criminal intention.

(TC: 00:04:02)
Adrian Morris: Okay. So, what, what I'm trying to find out here again, was it the same as before?
Who-,

(TC: 00:04:12)
Oyeteju Adedayo: It's same.

(TC: 00:04:12)
Adrian Morris: Who counted that £20,000 out?

(TC: 00:04:14)
Oyeteju Adedayo: Between the two of us.

(TC: 00:04:15)
Adrian Morris: Between the two of you.

(TC: 00:04:15)
Oyeteju Adedayo: She counted it to me for me to count, so that I'm giving it to them, they do not say to

me, 'I'm sorry, this is ten thousand or fifteen thousand.’ So in my presence, we counted it.

(TC: 00:04:25)
Adrian Morris: Okay.

(TC: 00:04:26)
Oyeteju Adedayo: In fact, it was, she was-, she was getting ready to send everything out.

(TC: 00:04:30)
Adrian Morris: Right.

(TC: 00:04:31)
Oyeteju Adedayo: Which I would, I didn't even know that about, no matter when she comes in, she
knows what she's supposed to do, she knows ways to send out, money out and everything. She was
getting, ready, I think. When I came in, I said, 'I' ve had the same problem again, and the mortgage has not
come through. The people have (inaudible 04.47) us or something, they haven't come though to me.'

(TC: 00:04:51)
Adrian Morris: Yeah.

(TC: 00:04:51)
Oyeteju Adedayo: I said, 'They are-, they are on my-, on my neck again.' And I started paying it back,
because it was-, it was, I was conscious of this.

(TC: 00:04:59)
Adrian Morris: Okay.

(TC: 00:04:59)
Oyeteju Adedayo: Personally, within my own, within the shop, I said I was paying it back, because it
was my concern to make sure that it was being paid back. It wasn't a case of taking completely.

(TC: 00:05:11)
Adrian Morris: Well, okay, so you took the £20,000, then, you, you and Joan, she gave it to you,
and what happened then?

Oyeteju Adedayo: I gave it to them.

(TC: 00:05:21)
Adrian Morris: You gave it to them, and what, were they in the shop this time?

(TC: 00:05:23)

Oyeteju Adedayo: No, they don't-, they won't come. Because um, when, if they come out, it would have
been a case of either shutting the doors, telling everybody, 'Oh, she owe lots of money.' Locking the door,
whatever. And I didn't want to owe them.

(TC: 00:05:35)
Adrian Morris: See, this is why I find it hard to believe that this is friends or family.

(TC: 00:05:40)
Oyeteju Adedayo: No, they do.

(TC: 00:05:39)
Adrian Morris: If you're actually paying them back, I find it hard to believe that this is the case.

(TC: 00:05:42)
Oyeteju Adedayo: They do, because as far as they are concemed, I' m still in Slough.

(TC: 00:05:45)
Adrian Morris: But this was six years ago.

(TC: 00:05:48)
Oyeteju Adedayo: I did say I was in Slough six years ago. I saw Slough about it, about 2003.

(TC: 00:05:52)
Adrian Morris: 2003? Okay, so this was-,

(TC: 00:05:52)
Oyeteju Adedayo: And, and I thought they would not get their money back.

Adrian Morris: Two years ago, then. Was it two years ago?

(TC: 00:05:56)

Oyeteju Adedayo: Yes, I, I've been having all the teething problem throughout. They eased off,
especially when I had high court case with the other woman, that he stole from me. But I surmised they
knew, that, which I told them, because you have to. I told them that, 'I' ve sold Slough. Well, you will get
your money, give me time. It's a case of I, it, I have it, Jan. If you can bare with me with this plan, let me
remortgage this property, which is not, the mortgage. Let me remortgage it. Give it back what I owe you.’

(TC: 00:06:29)

Adrian Morris: Okay, I, I think-, I think we covered that earlier. Now, so, this was June, July. And
then in June, July, August, they came back again, did they? Did they phone you to tell you they
were coming back, or did they just turn up?

(TC: 00:06:42)
Oyeteju Adedayo: I, um, we, sometimes we have meetings with them.

(TC: 00:06:46)
Adrian Morris: Right.

(TC: 00:06:46)
Oyeteju Adedayo: To let them know. And I said-,

(TC: 00:06:47)
Adrian Morris: Where were these meetings held, then?

(TC: 00:06:49)
Oyeteju Adedayo: Sometimes they come to the house, my house.

(TC: 00:06:51)
Adrian Morris: Right.

(TC: 00:06:52)
Oyeteju Adedayo: And I said to them, 'Give me time.' I show them the same letter got filled. In fact,
Commercial, I had three, four letters.

we, we can remortgage the whole package.

(TC: 00:07:10)
Adrian Morris: Why didn't you?

(TC: 00:07:11)
Oyeteju Adedayo: Oh, I mean, don't worry.

(TC: 00:07:12)
Adrian Morris: Okay, okay, okay.

(TC: 00:07:12)
Oyeteju Adedayo: I'm not sitting down floating my arms on the matter. It's been done. It was a case of,
I've taken it, you know, I-,

(TC: 00:07:20)
Adrian Morris: So, what happened to the one that you said £50,000 you, had been agreed in
principle?

(TC: 00:07:26)
Oyeteju Adedayo: The one that said 50 thousand has been-,

(TC: 00:07:27)
Adrian Morris: So, you said, 'Oh yes, it's 50 thousand, I agree with you."

(TC: 00:07:29)
Oyeteju Adedayo: I said twenty that time.

(TC: 00:07:30)
Adrian Morris: No, because you said, 'My plan was to give them ten thousand-,'

(TC: 00:07:34)
Adrian Morris: From what you had stolen at the Post Office.

(TC: 00:07:36)
Oyeteju Adedayo: Yeah.

(TC: 00:07:36)
Adrian Morris: And then the other 40 thousand, sorry. You were gonna put the ten thousand back
in, which you had stolen from the Post Office.

(TC: 00:07:41)
Oyeteju Adedayo: And then give them ten, to give me-,

(TC: 00:07:42)
Adrian Morris: And give them the other 40.

(TC: 00:07:43)
Oyeteju Adedayo: Yes. To give, first of all, twenty, because at that stage, I was, I thought.

(TC: 00:07:48)
Adrian Morris: And that's not what you said earlier, you said 50.

(TC: 00:07:49)
Oyeteju Adedayo: I did. 50, yeah, oh yeah, 50 I owed them. But when I add the ten thousand on, I was
trying to do, was not go to short term loan.

(TC: 00:08:00)
Adrian Morris: Right.

(TC: 00:08:00)
Oyeteju Adedayo: That's, which I mentioned earlier.

(TC: 00:08:03)
Adrian Morris: Okay, yeah.

(TC: 00:08:03)

Oyeteju Adedayo: I said, 'I don't want to do short term loan because it's so expensive to pay it back. I
wanted to tie the mortgage to the property, and then pay it like, um, in, um, over the length of the
mortgage.

(TC: 00:08:15)
Adrian Morris: Right.

(TC: 00:08:16)
Oyeteju Adedayo: You understand, right? That for short term loan like that, God knows how much they
will expect me to pay. And I didn't want to do short term loan.

(TC: 00:08:25)
Adrian Morris: Okay.

(TC: 00:08:25)

Oyeteju Adedayo: So, when they initially said they would do the twenty thousand, the guy then said to
me, 'I didn't realise that you want us to tie it to the property. I'm going to pass, I can phone them, out of
just, joke, in front of here now, and he will say to me what is going on.' I said, he said to me, 'I will pass it
on to the mortgage section because, for that amount, the mortgage section will tie it to the property.’
Because I said I don't want short term loan, short term loan which is going to obviously kill me. You
understand? I said I don't want short term loan. All I wanted was to give them something to just give me
time.

(TC: 00:09:02)
Adrian Morris: So you-, so you stole from the Post Office to cover that interim period?

(TC: 00:09:09)

Oyeteju Adedayo: Well, I stole, yeah. But I did not steal with the intention of criminal mind. It was a
case of saving, trying to save a, a situation that was just beyond me. It was a-, I, I, I would not lie. I'm
raising my-, I, I would not sit here willingly if I was going to lie about it. I wouldn't.

(TC: 00:09:36)

(TC: 00:09:46)
Oyeteju Adedayo: I didn't mean-, it was a case of still I'm not wanting to put it back because I know I-, or
lie about it.

(TC: 00:09:54)
Natasha Bernard: Right.

(TC: 00:09:54)
Oyeteju Adedayo: Because as soon as it came in and I came in, I was told, I told him.

(TC: 00:09:58)
Natasha Bernard: Yes.

(TC: 00:09:58)
Oyeteju Adedayo: I'd not even started doing-, I said, ' Carl, I need to own up to something.’ I didn't let
him waste all this time

(TC: 00:10:04)
Natasha Bernard: Right, yeah.

(TC: 00:10:05)
Oyeteju Adedayo: Because that was the, the intention.

(TC: 00:10:07)
Natasha Bernard: Yeah.

(TC: 00:10:07)

Oyeteju Adedayo: If it was that, I would say, 'I'm coming back in one minute, I need to get-,' probably
get as far away as-, when he started out, start looking for people. Why do I want to do that? I've got the
property here. I don't need to. I don't want to do that.

(TC: 00:10:23)

to find out, wasn't he?

(TC: 00:10:27)
Oyeteju Adedayo: Oh absolutely.

(TC: 00:10:27)
Natasha Bernard: So-,

(TC: 00:10:28)
Oyeteju Adedayo: But then, I could have gone away from here.

(TC: 00:10:31)
Natasha Bernard: Yeah, you could've done.

(TC: 00:10:31)

Oyeteju Adedayo: And you would be looking, which, it could be worse, really. And I don't, at least, that
was initially never my intention. Never. I've never in all my four, five years, touched the Post Office
money. I don't handle it. In fact, when we had the book that we were, I used to run away. Because I did
the training, but the book, the blue book, has always, when I'm looking at it, I'm like, oh. You know, until
the computer came, which was fantastic.

(TC: 00:10:58)
Natasha Bernard: Okay.

(TC: 00:10:58)
Oyeteju Adedayo: We both liked it, and all that, so. I didn't mean to really do something dreadful with a
no-care attitude. Of course I care. Of course it's, I care about the business, of course it, my concern is for

the business as well.

(TC: 00:11:12)
Natasha Bernard: Mmhmm.

(TC: 00:11:12)

Oyeteju Adedayo: I just didn't want them to mess up the plan I had. Because, I don't know, you might
never have seen it before, but if some families, they don't, this thing happen, it could, up until the point of
even, probably killing you, because they thought that you want to have one over them, especially selling
in Berkshire.

(TC: 00:11:31)
Natasha Bernard: You see, what, what I don't understand is that, that you had Berkshire, you've
had Slough, you've had-, where's Catkin's (ph 11.37) Road?

(TC: 00:11:36)
Oyeteju Adedayo: That's Berkshire.

(TC: 00:11:38)
Natasha Bernard: Right, okay.

(TC: 00:11:38)
Oyeteju Adedayo: Slough is Berkshire.

(TC: 00:11:39)
Natasha Bernard: Okay. So, you've, you, you seem like you-, I mean, you've had to get mortgages
for these, haven't you?

(TC: 00:11:45)
Oyeteju Adedayo: Initially, we were living in Berkshire, before I ever had this.

(TC: 00:11:48)
Natasha Bernard: Right.

stealing the money from the Post Office.

(TC: 00:37:18)
Oyeteju Adedayo: Nobody called-,

(TC: 00:37:19)
Adrian Morris: Talking over each other 37.19) 560, who's Jas?

(TC: 00:37:20)
Oyeteju Adedayo: Nobody called Jas.

(TC: 00:37:22)
Adrian Morris: So, why have you just got a J there and a J-A-S on that one? On the £10 note
column. On the £5 note column you've got L-E-D, what-, what's the difference?

(TC: 00:37:34)
Oyeteju Adedayo: Yeah, that' s-, (inaudible 37.36) it's not any difference.

Oyeteju Adedayo: Yeah, I know, but-,

(TC: 00:37:40)
Adrian Morris: The P would stand for pocket.

(TC: 00:37:41)
Oyeteju Adedayo: Maybe the way I write sometimes because that doesn't mean a thing, you know, (mw

(TC: 00:37:45)
Adrian Morris: Well, it must mean something.

(TC: 00:37:46)
Oyeteju Adedayo: J means Joan has already put that in the pouch, in, in the thing, there's a tray.

(TC: 00:37:52)
Adrian Morris: Right.

(TC: 00:37:53)
Oyeteju Adedayo: You understand?

(TC: 00:37:53)
Adrian Morris: Yeah.

(TC: 00:37:54)
Oyeteju Adedayo: We feed from that tray, from the safe into that tray, from that tray under the counter,
because we haven't got a drawer.

Oyeteju Adedayo: You understand? And when we call it-, um, count back, we count back like that, but
she always leave me a float in that tray. Always a float.

(TC: 00:38:09)
Adrian Morris: Okay.

(TC: 00:38:10)
Oyeteju Adedayo: In that tray, because, um, opening the safe sometimes takes a while. So, she always,
always leave me-, you-, we say the tray downstairs, it! s not a lie. We put it-, I put it to the denomination.

(TC: 00:38:24)
Adrian Morris: Okay.

(TC: 00:38:26)
Natasha Bernard: So, that-,

(TC: 00:38:30)
Oyeteju Adedayo: Because we don't have, like, a proper drawer.

(TC: 00:38:34)
Natasha Bernard: So, how, how did you keep a note of how much money you were giving to these
people? Did you keep a note of it or you just knew?

(TC: 00:38:42)
Oyeteju Adedayo: How do you mean?

(TC: 00:38:43)
Natasha Bernard: Well, did you have to write it down?

(TC: 00:38:46)

Oyeteju Adedayo: Oh, (mw 38.50) really, but yes. They know that I owe them 50-, I know I owe them
50. I give them ten initially. They, they will not lie about-, they were not concerned about me giving them
extra. That wasn't the initial plan, it was at a meeting, family meeting, I needed this to raise, to buy the
business

Oyeteju Adedayo: Yes. In fact, at the early stages there's another friend I helped in London and she has
had the-, our money, about 1,000 towards it because without the, um, initial, um, stock would be about
ten, but when they counted and everything we were, like, 1,000 short. So, she initially gave me the 1,000
and I' ve given it to-,

(TC: 00:39:57)
Natasha Bernard: Well, to be fair, I mean, you actually had-, you, you, you had enough, didn't
you? You were-, if you'd have gone through the proper channels-,

(TC: 00:40:03)

Oyeteju Adedayo: Believe me, I know. That was what I was trying to do, that was what I thought I would
be able to do. Do you-, in-, and on time. All this is time-, it was just time consuming. It wasn't-, it-, it
would have-, people would have known, if I paid in it and said, 'I don't know what you're talking about,'
it's a different-, you-, people would have known. Do you know what I'm saying? But it was just the time.

(TC: 00:40:28)
Adrian Morris: But you had two years to sort it out.

(TC: 00:40:31)
Oyeteju Adedayo: I didn't have two years.

(TC: 00:40:32)
Adrian Morris: Well, you did have two years.

(TC: 00:40:32)
Oyeteju Adedayo: Because they didn't ask me at that time-, I know.

Oyeteju Adedayo: I didn't think they wanted it straight away. I didn't-,

(TC: 00:40:51)
Adrian Morris: But that's not straight away, that's two years.

(TC: 00:40:52)

Oyeteju Adedayo: I know, I know, but I thought I will have time because, okay, I' ve just bought the
property and to go back to the bank and say, 'I want £50,000 more," I was-, I, I, I just felt it'd be silly, and
at that time they were not really pressurising me. In big fairness, they were-, they wanted the money but
the moment they realise that I' ve sold back share, that's when it sank in that, 'Oh, what about our money?"

(TC: 00:41:21)
Adrian Morris: But that was two years ago.

(TC: 00:41:22)

Oyeteju Adedayo: Yeah, you know what, I will tell you. There's nothing hidden, believe me, I'm saying it
from my heart. I'm opening my rubbish heart here. I'm opening up my-, I' m-, believe me.

you'd like to add-,

Oyeteju Adedayo: It-, I don't want-, this is what I was trying to avoid. I was-, believe me, I was trying to
avoid them embarrassing me, and I was try-, I, I just thought maybe the Post Office will understand. I
know, I took the money but I thought they would understand, give me time. I don't-, I take my job
serious. I take everything that is written in the contract very serious. I would not-, I would not do anything
like this if I wasn't sandwiched between a pillar and a post. And it was just a case of avoiding the
embarrassment, truly, truly. And I'm sorry, because it's not something I' ve done deliberately-, no, I don't
know, like, I don't even need-, if, if it's something for me, I don't even need it. You understand? But
because I had to give it to them, hence this all came to a head and I thought, ' Okay, the Post Office will
come, I will explain.’ In fact, I was almost giving somebody a call, the person that actually interviewed
me and did everything, I called to tell her, because I couldn't sleep in my own bed either.

(TC: 00:44:20)
Natasha Bernard: Right.

(TC: 00:44:20)

Oyeteju Adedayo: If the remortgage has come through, believe me, (mw 44.24), what do I need the

been on one.
