Dear Elliot,
Addendum to Letter of Appointment dated 06" May 2021

The Board approved in principle the provision of a deed of indemnification for the
statutory directors of Post Office Limited at the Board meeting held on 30
November 2021 and the approval of the final wording of that deed will be sought
at the Board meeting on 25‘ January 2022. The terms of your appointment will
therefore include an addition to the paragraph on insurance and indemnity
(addition text shown in bold, italics):

“Insurance and indemnity

The Company has directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and it intends to
maintain such cover for the full term of your appointment. The limit of the
indemnity is £60,000,000 for each and every Claim and/or Related Claim and in
the aggregate (current at the date of this letter). A copy of the policy document
is available from the Company Secretary.

In addition, a deed of indemnity is in place for the directors, providing
an alternative to relying on or claiming against the Directors’ and
Officers’ Policy, if for any reason there was a failure to renew a D&O
policy, insufficient cover or general issues in getting an insurer to
pay. The procedure for the Board in relation to the indemnity is available
from the Company Secretary.”
