UjitsU Statement - Hertford Heath SPSO

Pete,

Please note the email below.
This refers to the quote for £7,400.00 which was communicated to me by your Commercial Team.
The Defendent hasn't secured Legal Aide and Defence are asking for a witness statement instead.

FUJ00155987
FUJ00155987

Given that Fujitsu (Andy Dunks) have already supplied a witness statement in this case and from my recollection we are within our
quota for statements YTD, is it possible that Andy could provide a ‘further to' statement, covering what Defence are asking for.

Regards,

Dave Posnett

Dave

As discussed I have been contacted by Samantha Lennard the Solicitor acting for Wendy Cousins re the above office. She has
informed me that The Law Society will not be allowing the Forensic Examination to take place due to the cost (£7k+). Therefore
she has requested that a statement is provided from Fujitsu detailing what data or files remains on the hard drive that I have in my
possession. She would also like included in the statement the process of how the data is lifted from the hard drive and stored and

at what point the hard drive would have ceased operating.

In simple terms as she put it she would like an idiots guide to the workings of the Horizon System!

Regards

Lisa
