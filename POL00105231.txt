Introduction

These Procedures and Standards (P&S) deal with the appropriate action that should be taken should if
an Investigator feels that following an investigation, a member of Royal Mail Group Ltd (RMG Ltd) staff
should be suspended from duty. Suspension is viewed as a precautionary measure whilst the case
progresses and such action is almost invariably taken when the suspected offence is facilitated by the
nature of the employee’s duties, for example a Postman stealing postal packets.

The Suspension Process

Authority to Suspend. Should an Investigator think it is appropriate to suspend a suspect, authority
should be sought from an appropriate manager. An appropriate manager is the unit manager, such as
a Shift Manager or a Delivery Office Manager, within the unit concerned. Should it not be practicable
to obtain authority to suspend from a manager described above, then authority can be sought from
any Line Manager, preferably, within the same function as the suspect.

Should Investigators not be able to contact any Line Manager, then they may, as an interim measure,
suspend suspect offenders themselves. If Investigators do suspend they should endeavour to inform
the appropriate manager, of their actions, as soon as practicable. The suspended person’s Line
Manager is responsible for informing the Human Resources Service Centre of the suspension.

Provisional Authority to Suspend. Should an Investigator anticipate difficulty in obtaining authority to
suspend, (perhaps due to the operation taking place in out of hours) then consideration should be
given to obtaining “provisional” authority, from an appropriate manager, prior to undertaking the
operation.

Checks of official stocks or property. Whenever a member of RMG Ltd staff is about to be suspended
from duty his/her official property, (including such things as surcharge tills), should be checked, if this
has not already been done during the course of the enquiry. The local manager who usually performs
such checks should normally carry out this check. The check should be carried out in the presence of
the suspected offender but, if this is not practicable, it should be done in the presence of a union
representative, but may be carried out in the presence of an independent witness, should a union
representative not be available.

Suspending the Suspect. The suspect should be informed that they are;

2.5.1 Being suspended on full pay.

2.5.2 Being suspended on the authority of ... (give the name of the person authorising the
suspension).

2.5.3 Not allowed to access official premises, unless it is to attend a pre arranged appointment, (for
example with the conduct manager, a union representative or Atos Healthcare). Then if on
RMG Ltd premises they should be escorted off them.

Recovery of Royal Mail Group Ltd Property. As part of the suspension process the Investigator should
recover any official passes, badges, keys or any other official property in possession of the suspected
offender. This includes uniform, which should be handed to the relevant Unit Manager, for storage as
appropriate, pending the outcome of the disciplinary case. Should Investigators be unable to recover
such items then they should inform the relevant Unit Manager, so they can make the appropriate local
arrangements to recover the property.

3.1 Royal Mail Group Ltd Young Persons (RMGYP). RMGYP are Royal Mail Group Ltd employees who have
not reached their 18th birthday. Should such a young person be suspended from duty, even if there is
no specific risk to them, arrangements should be made to prevent them going home alone after the
suspension. If the RMGYP is less than 17 years old then they will have an appropriate adult with them
so it is acceptable for them to leave in the care of their appropriate adult. If there is not an
appropriate adult present, then arrangements should be made for the RMGYP to be taken to their
home address and given into the care of a responsible adult.

3.2 Right to Privacy. Prior to arrival at the RMGYP’s home address Investigators should ensure that the
RMGYP is content with what they will tell the responsible adult, bearing in mind their right to privacy.
If the Investigator cannot take the RMGYP home personally then a responsible local supervisor should
be carefully instructed on how to carry out this task in a discrete and tactful manner.

4. Disciplinary Incidents

4.1 It is possible that in the course of an enquiry, a breach of discipline not amounting to a criminal
offence may be observed, or may come to light, the nature of which is sufficiently serious to raise the
question whether or not some employees should be suspended from duty. In these cases the
Investigator should report the facts orally (and if necessary followed up in a formal written report), to
the subject’s Line Manager. It is for them to decide whether or not the individual should be
suspended from duty. (Line Managers can only have access to recorded CCTV images in discipline
cases if they have the authority of the Director of Investigations.)
