Took calll from trainer today (lan
Patterson), who feels that more training is
required at the above branch. It appears
that with the satellite branches that are
run from this site, not enough time has
been requested to properley cover the

main branch of Howey. Therefore we
would welcome additional training in line
with the areas highlighted in the trainers
report as soon as is practible.
