1 Review of Previous Minutes

2 Security Policy 1. HP reported the RMGA policy had been updated following Post
Office comments. It has been sent out for internal Fujitsu review
(Post Office Information Security has an informal copy). The date
for Fujitsu comments is now passed. Hillary Forest (Fujitsu
Commercial) had raised some minor comments that needed
resolving. An updated version with comments resolved will be
formally issued to Post Office by 4 July. Action BP.

BP: All comments outstanding form have been addressed and the
policy is now out and awaiting approval with Acc Dir.

2. HP would like to get a version of the policy formally approved as the
HNG-X project was currently progressing in a policy vacuum. PH
reminded him that the policy is critical for acceptance and an
incomplete policy might fail even if approved. HP replied he
believed all significant issues raised by Post Office to have been

addressed.

Post Office are also updating the Community Information Security
Policy (CISP). A first release has restructured it to follow the
updated 1SO017799 and hence ISO 27001. This version has been
formally released for comment. No comments were received. It will
now be updated to reflect the changes for HNG-X. A round table
review will be organised with Fujitsu when the document is
complete. Action PH

ISMS Manual

1. There was some discussion about ensuring the (non-contractual)
ISMS Manual and the (contractual) service description aligned with
each other and with the service to be provided. It was agreed to do
this in a two step process:

a. Align the ISMS Manual with the existing Service Description
for HNG-X. Action BP.

A review of the ISMS is underway a meeting is arranged on
Mon 4" Aug to address the first step of ensuring the ISMS
accurately reflects it’s objectives and compliments the
security service description SVM/SEC/SD/0017. (BP)

b. Review the Service Description and align both it and the
ISMS Manual with the service to be delivered raising a
Change Request to cover and changes. Action: HP to
initiate.

The Service description SVM/SEC/SD/0017 is a CCD and
describes the service the security team currently provides.
A review /update of this document is underway to ensure it
accurately reflects the service the security team currently
provides. (PS)

NB: The ISMS Manual does not replace or enhance the Security
Service Description document in any way. It is a separate and local
document which describes a high level overview of the approach and
framework (known as ISMS) used within RMGA Security.

Security Improvement Plan

1. The report(s) identifying progress against the SIP and the HNG-X
Risk Treatment Plan had not been circulated before the meeting.

NL Sent the IG Pack out prior to 10" June this included the SIP.
BP Sent Mar/Apr/May RT Matrix to DK prior to 23 Jun 08.

2. Circulation of the monthly reporting pack for this meeting still seems
problematic. It was agreed that it could be sent to SL in plain and to

3. PH as a self-extracting password protected file. The password would
be texted separately. Action BP.

Disagree: Did we all agree to this?

I thought I only agreed to send the SOA as a PGP to PH.
I did this on 27/06/08 ‘as promised’.

I think this entry by PH may be incorrect. Your views?

4. Post Office have still not seen or agreed the terms of reference for
this series of meetings (an action on Fujitsu in the Security
Improvement Plan). HP assured the meeting they had been
prepared. He will distribute a copy for comment. Action HP.

5. The updated plan showing progress towards ISO 27001 certification
had also not been circulated as promised last meeting. Action HP
222?

6. BP reported the scope had now been finalised and would remain
static until reviewed in 12 months. SL reminded him of the need to
review the scope on major changes prior to that date and asked for
a copy of the scope. Both points were agreed. Action BP.

Copy sent to DK as promised (PGP’d) 27/06/08

7. SL asked HP to comment on a rumour that RMGA did not intend to
seek formal certification against ISO 27001. HP assured her the
rumour was untrue; the audit by BSI is still planned for August.

In view of staff sickness/leave etc this may be delayed to
September???

Security Incident Response Plan

1. PS reported he has produced a plan covering PCI-related incidents
for RMGA in conjunction with Richard Barber. Richard had also
produced one for Post Office Limited. A combined HNG-X business
continuity plan is now being developed. There will be a walk-though
to ensure consistency.

Connie Penn had raised a concern that the plan was a disaster
recovery plan and that business continuity is not fully addressed,
especially with reference to testing of the plan. HP reported he had
discussed the issue with Connie and there is now agreement.

SL apologised for not joining the previous day’s rehearsal. The dial-
in details provided did not work.

Meetings are being set up to rehearse the Elective Disconnect
process (switching off one data centre).

HNG-X Acceptance

FW had prepared a series of document summarising the position on
Document Review acceptance “tests” for security.

Sensitive documents (such as the Statement of Applicability) which
have a restricted circulation will be sent password protected direct to
PH rather than via the RMGA and HNG-X document management
systems. (Actioned as stated above BP)

SEC-3255 requires criminal record checks by RMGA. BP reported
they will be required in a revised HR policy awaiting internal
approval. The new document will be submitted to Post Office and
be cross-referenced in the RMGA Information Security Policy.
Action BP.

A meeting has taken place with HR and GS. Process
documentation by HR, plus licensing for software is underway. A
review of this will take place around 20" Aug and completion date
expected to be 1** September.

More details in the post-meeting notes circulated by FW.

AOB
