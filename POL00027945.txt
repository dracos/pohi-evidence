Proposals for Work Packages and Agreed Form Commercial Terms shall be sent by
Fujitsu Services to the Post Office Change Control Manager.

Fujitsu Services’ authorised representative shall, subject to paragraph 5.7, within three
weeks of receipt of a request for a Work Package from Post Office in accordance with
paragraph 5.4 or where this is not possible, within such other reasonable timeframe as
Fujitsu Services may notify the Post Office Change Control Manager, offer to carry out
Work Packages on the Commercial Terms by signing a proposed Agreed Form Terms
& Conditions in relation thereto and delivering it to the Post Office Change Control
Manager, Finsbury Dials, 1st Floor, 20, Finsbury Street, London, EC2Y 9AQ. If a CCN
is required, a copy of the completed CCN signed by Fujitsu Services shall accompany
the proposed Agreed Form Commercial Terms. The offer may be taken up by Post
Office in the manner described in paragraph 5.8 up to midnight on the Expiry Date.

In relation to any requests for a Work Package that involve software development
received from Post Office in accordance with paragraph 5.4 that, in order to provide a
detailed response, would require analysis to be undertaken by Fujitsu Services after 31
March 2010, Fujitsu Services' obligation under paragraph 5.6 shall be for its authorised
representative to provide Post Office within three weeks of receipt of that Work Package
request with a high level response indicating the charges that would be payable by Post
Office to Fujitsu Services for providing a detailed response to the Work Package
request. Such high level response shall set out:

5.7.1 the number of man days of effort required by grade;
5.7.2 lead times, start and end dates for the work required; and

5.7.3 the nature of the task envisaged, to enable the appropriate skill set to be
identified.

Following review of such high level response, Post Office shall, within a reasonable
period, notify Fujitsu Services whether it wishes Fujitsu Services to respond to the
request for Work Package on the terms proposed by Fujitsu Services (or such other
terms as the Parties may agree) and if so shall authorise Fujitsu Services to produce a
detailed response on those terms and otherwise in accordance with paragraph 5.6.

To place the Work Order for the Work Package on the basis of the Commercial Terms,
Post Office Change Control Manager shall:

5.8.1 counter-sign the proposed Agreed Form Terms & Conditions;
5.8.2 where a CCN is required, counter-sign the CCN;

5.8.3 raise a Purchase Order in the amount of the gross price for the Work Package
or Work Package Element and enter the Purchase Order number on to the
signature sheet of the Agreed Form Terms & Conditions; and

5.8.4 deliver them to Fujitsu Services at the address referred to in paragraph 5.4
before midnight on the Expiry Date.

If a Work Order is received after the Expiry Date, Fujitsu Services may return the Work
Order to Post Office within five Working Days clearly marked "rejected", in which case
it shall be of no effect. If not so returned, it shall be deemed accepted notwithstanding
that it was received after the Expiry Date.

If following the placing of a Work Order one or other Party discovers that it involves
changes to the Agreement such that a CCN should have been agreed beforehand, that
Party shall notify the other immediately and the Commercial Leads shall discuss the
matter as soon as possible. If the Parties are unable to agree a CCN or a restriction of
scope of the Work Order to avoid the need for a CCN, the Work Order shall be

Commercial Terms or other documents in approved form that are the subject of or
incorporated in a Work Order that do not involve:

5.12.2 an overall extension of Release timescales; or
