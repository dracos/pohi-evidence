Note to Angus Crawford

Angus,

Kenny has asked that ECT now consider this case to establish whether or not we
can raise proceedings. You were aware of it from previous discussions with
Andrew Lazzarin. Can you now please take over from where he left off and if
sufficient fill in the template for Kenny to authorise petition proceedings.

Thanks

Alison
