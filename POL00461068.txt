Hi JK,

Please see below and attached the copy for the webpage and the two corresponding attachments for
publication.

Post Office is today publishing correspondence from 9th January 2024, sent by the Post Office to
the Ministry of Justice, copied to the Department for Business and Trade.

The purpose of the correspondence was to explain the work that Post Office had requested its legal
counsel, Peters & Peters, undertake to proactively identify, on the papers available, any convictions
that could be unsafe. This was primarily to offer the Government any support that might assist them
as they consider relevant issues in advance of passing legislation, without any value judgement on
what the correct course of action might be.

The letter references a note provided by Post Office’s legal counsel, this note was not solicited by
Post Office and, as can be seen, was sent to express the personal views of its author. Post Office
was in no way seeking to persuade Government against mass exoneration.

Post Office are fully supportive of any steps taken by Government to speed up the exoneration of
those with wrongful convictions and to provide redress to victims, with the information having been
provided to inform that consideration.

Kind regards,

Mark Cazaly
