1 Introduction

This document presents the Corrective Action Plan that emerged from a post audit
meeting following the audit of the operation of CSR+ Development.

2 + Process

This Plan will go through a number of iterations and reviews following production as
Corrective Actions (CA) are worked on and, subject to agreement between the CA
Owner and Internal Audit, amended.

The status will remain OPEN until such time as the CA Owner and Internal Audit
agree on a course of action to address the issue at which time the status will be
changed to ACTION. Once the actions have been carried out, subject to agreement
between the CA Owner and Internal Audit, the status will change to CLOSED.

Once actions have been agreed the Plan will be monitored by the responsible manager
and subject to periodic review by Internal Audit.

3 Key to Plan

CAP Ref. Unique number allocated to each Observation/ Recommendation
for follow-up
Report Ref. Paragraph number in the original report where the

Owner The identified owner of the Corrective Action (CA)
MTM Management Team Member to whom the CA Owner reports

Agreed Action/Commentary Detail of the CA agreed between the CA Owner and IA. If the CA
Status is OPEN or ACTION it will contain a commentary of the
current position.

Due Date The date of the next important event in the CA. Where the Status

Hard evidence is an important element of ISO
registration. The audit found little in the way of hard
evidence to support assertions made wrt reviews.

There was an abundance of verbal assurances that
lifecycle reviews had taken place but very little hard
evidence, in the form of walkthrough notes, document
comment sheets, review meeting minutes, etc existed.
Having moved from the NR2 position where even
anecdotal evidence was hard to find Pathway must now
formalise the documenting and retention of review
outcomes. Not only does this provide evidence of review
but can also be used to measure the effectiveness of the
review process itself, an important element of
continuous process improvement.

The audit identified that EPOSS continues to be

unstable. PinICL evidence illustrated the numbers of
PinICLs raised since the 1998 Task Force and the rate of
their being raised.

The EPOSS Solutions Report [7] made specific
recommendations to consider the re-design and re-write
of EPOSS, in part or in whole, to address the then
known shortcomings. In light of the continued evidence
of poor product quality these recommendations should
be re-considered.

(~80%) were to do with error and printer error handling. Daily
meetings had been instigated. TPA of view that while original
code had not been good it would be difficult to justify the case
for re-writing now.

25/11 : Email issued by TPA :-

“We have not formally closed down the recommendation that
we re-engineer the EPOSS application due to its inherent
instability. Since this recommendation was made, a number of
events/actions have taken place. We embarked upon a major
maintenance exercise for LT2 which targeted several known
stability issues. In parallel, we carried out a defensive testing
activity which identified a number of faults which were
addressed. The intensive exercise designed to remove
acceptance incident 298 resulted in many substantial
improvements to the error handling, messaging and printing
aspects of the product. We finally introduced improved unit
and link testing and more disciplined configuration control.
Finally, the maintainability and enhanceability of the product
has been proven by the speed and quality of the SIP 16 and
EPOSS Reconciliation developments.

We will of course continue to monitor the PINICL stack for the
next few months and if necessary re-evaluate this decision.
Would Jan please close this issue formally using the rationale
described.”

lead to inconsistency in Pathways approach to risk

It is anticipated that the Predict! register will form the

The Programme Office has developed a separate risk GK
register which the audit considered should be applied to
all delivery streams.

The risks identified on the PO risk register apply in
whole or in part to all Delivery Units. In order to ensure
that Delivery Managers and Team Leaders address the
detail of these risks they should be incorporated into
each DU’s risk register and the risks managed alongside
those already identified.

Concern was expressed by a number of Team Leaders Gc
about the planning process.

For the Planning Process to be accepted and used
positively by the Team Leaders it is imperative that it
meets their needs as well as management’s. I recommend
that a full review is carried out of the Planning Process
that confirms or refutes the concerns raised by the Team
Leaders and establishes a process that is acceptable to,
and used by, all interested parties.

suggests that new appointee will not be capable of conducting a

Quality planning was virtually non existent.

It is questionable whether there is any benefit in
producing Quality Plans at this stage of CSR+

contributory factors must be realised in future Release

The audit considered that insufficient management
attention was being given to the contractual requirement
to obtain ISO registration by September 2000.

Having personally steered three separate companies
through the rigours of ISO 9000 registration, including
one to ISO9001/TickIT, I believe that the breadth of
scope of the proposed certification, and the time
remaining in which to achieve it, demands that a full
time Project Manager is assigned to the task. Either the
Quality Manager should be able to transfer any non-
essential initiatives or a resource should be assigned to
him specifically to manage the registration commitment.
