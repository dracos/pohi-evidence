Attachment: JAMES ARBUTHNOT POINTS.docx

Please find attached our responses to James’ points for addition to the pack. We have also stuck up top a possible
intervention for Jo to use if he starts using his parliamentary privilege to claim that there have been miscarriages of
justice.

Obviously the tone and strength of these rebuttals are up to Jo, but we cannot continually hold further reviews and
investigations just because JA has not found the smoking gun that he was hoping for.

As you know I am out of action from 1000-1300. Tim will do any further pen holding, but please be aware he does not
know much about this specific topic, he would effectively be the conduit for further advice from POL.

Kind regards
