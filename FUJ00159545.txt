HORIZON OVERVIEW

Horizon is the core operational and Electronic Point of Sales platform for the Post
Office network. Fujitsu began work on a pilot of the system in 1996 and it was
rolled out across the Post Office network between 1999 and 2002. In 2010 there
was a migration from the system commonly referred to as "Legacy Horizon" to an
online version ("HNG-X" or "Horizon Online"). The key difference between
Legacy Horizon and Horizon Online is the way in which data is stored: locally in
Legacy Horizon and centrally in Horizon Online. (FJ! what is the main
difference between HNGX and HNG*A?] There is no functional difference.
HNG-A refers to an implementation of the same counter code as is used in HNG-
X to run on a Windows 10 device (whereas HNG-X counters are NT4 devices).

The mechanism for delivering the code to the counters is different for HNG-A.

[Potted history of key dates and functional changes? Key dates from GJ's
statement are: Network Banking 2003; Acceptance of Debit Cards 2003;
EMV (ie use of Chip and PIN) 2004; Cash Account removed 2005; Data
Centre Migration 2009; and HNG-X Rollout 2010.]

WERE POST OFFICE AND/OR FUJITSU ABLE TO ACCESS TRANSACTION
DATA RECORDED BY HORIZON REMOTELY?

[FJ - are there any forms of remote access other than the ones dealt with in
section 8 below that are used by Post Office to access transaction data
remotely? (i.e. anything in addition to Balancing Transactions, Privileged

Users and the Transaction Information Processing Repair Tool)? What
transaction data does Post Office receive?]
DOES POST OFFICE HAVE THE ABILITY/FACILITY TO INSERT, INJECT,

EDIT OR DELETE TRANSACTION DATA OR DATA IN BRANCH
ACCOUNTS?

Post Office personnel do not have the ability/facility to insert, inject, edit or delete
transaction data or data in branch accounts.

I understand that the Claimants' have asserted that Post Office and/or Fujitsu
could do so by way of:

"global branches" (with branch codes such as 999998 and 999999), which would enable
the input of transactions within Horizon as though it had come from an actual Branch"."

8.3

8.4

8.5

8.6

The Claimants are referring to global users. Global users belong to either branch
code 999998 or 999999 (they are managed through the [Post Office/Fujitsu]
helpdesk which [is/used to be] split across two locations and there is a separate
code for each location. [FUlS/please confirm Which Wording in Square
brackets is correct]

Global users are auditors, engineers or emergency managers. [FUl2 are there
any others?] Auditors and engineers cannot conduct transactions. Emergency
managers can conduct transactions when they are in branches. Such
transactions carry the user ID 999998 or 999999 so it is clear that they have been
conducted by a global user in the transaction and event data recorded by
Horizon.

When a Subpostmaster forgets their password, a global user can cause a
password reset. [FJ how is this done?]

EDIT OR DELETE TRANSACTION DATA OR DATA IN BRANCH ACCOUNTS;
(2) IMPLEMENT FIXES IN HORIZON THAT HAD THE POTENTIAL TO
AFFECT TRANSACTION DATA OR DATA IN BRANCH ACCOUNTS; OR (3)
REBUILD BRANCH TRANSACTION DATA?

The way in which transaction data is recorded by Horizon Online is set out in
section [x] below. [At this stage it should be noted that branch accounts are
stored in the Branch Database (BRDB) in Horizon Online whereas in Legacy
Horizon the branch accounts were stored locally.) [FJ'*is it Correct that the
branch accounts are Stored in the BRDB7] The data is stored in BRDB so yes.

Balancing Transactions (BTs)

9.2.1 A small group of Fujitsu users (30 users) have the ability to inject
additional transactions into a branch's accounts, through normal
system functionality, via BTs. [FJ’= has this always been possible in
Horizon? If not, when did it become possible? Are records
available?) The BT mechanism applies to HNG-X — not to Legacy
Horizon

9.2.2 BTs are conducted using the branch transactional correction tool (this
has nothing to do with TCs;? the tool was named before Post Office
introduced TCs). The tool is described in section 5.2.2 of the
document [exhibit DES/APP/HLD/0020] and the Host BRDB
Transaction Correction Too! Low Level Design document [exhibit
DEV/APP/LLD/0142].

9.2.3 BTs do not require formal acceptance through the Horizon terminal by

branch staff (unlike TCs and transaction acknowledgements).*

9.2.4 BTs are clearly visible in the transaction reports that are available to
Subpostmasters via Horizon as they are stated to have been carried
out on counter number 99/ [FU//has this always been the case?" If,
not, when did the change/changes happen and what changed?)

9.2.5 Audit data over the use of BTs is available from 12 March 2010 [Amy -
has this been disclosed?]. Since that time, only one BT has been
inserted into a branch's accounts. [FU thé audit data reviewed by!
Deloitte only went up to 28 May 2016 - please confirm that there
have been no further BTs since that time.]

9.2.6 The TFS* helpdesk ticket relating to this BT (TFS ticket 2091569)
[Amy - has this been disclosed?] was raised by Anthony Vasse of
the Horizon Service Desk on 02 March 2010 and transferred to Cheryl
Card (SSC Product Specialist). The ticket states that the clerk had
incorrectly doubled a transfer of stock of £4,000 to £8,000, creating a
shortfall of £4000 in the branch accounts. The issue required a
resolution by 17 March 2010 because the branch was due to roll into
the next trading period on that date.

9.2.7 The ticket was updated by Cheryl Card on 11 March 2010 to confirm
that the issue had been resolved by inserting transactions into the
BRDB_RX_REP_SESSION and BRDB_RX_EPOSS_TRANSACTIONS
tables to reverse the incorrect £4000 charge. The ticket confirmed that
the Subpostmaster had been advised to print a balance snapshot of the
accounts before and after the BT took place to ensure the transaction
had been reversed correctly. A subsequent update was provided
confirming that the issue had been resolved and the ticket was closed
on 04 April 2010.

9.2.8 The Peak Incident ticket raised in relation to the BT (PC0195561) was
raised by Lorraine Elliot of the [Horizon] Service Desk [TBC] on 15
April 2010 [exhibit].

9.2.9 An OCP* ticket (25882) was also raised which is the solution
management system used by Fujitsu which tracks issues and
resolutions. [Amy - has this been disclosed?] This shows that the
BT was approved by Emma Langfield of Post Office on 10 March 2010
at 15:33. The ticket was raised by Cheryl Card, who subsequently
performed the work and inserted the balancing transaction.

9.2.10 [BTs are used more routinely (although still infrequently — 1,643
instances during the period of approximately 6 years) to update a flag
which can become locked in the wrong binary setting (1, 0), preventing
updates to stock units within a branch.]

9.3 Privileged Users

9.3.1 A limited number of authorised Fujitsu personnel (19 at the operating
system layer and 26 at the database layer) have privileges to add /
delete / change data in the BRDB (Privileged Users).

[FJ what records do we have that show how many Privileged
Users there have been historically? Awaiting confirmation from.
Fu

Privileged User access is required for system maintenance purposes,
such as updating database records to implement change and planned
system updates. [FU /does this explain why Privileged Users can
alter transaction data?) Horizon has functionality to resolve the
significant majority of imaginable operational errors in branch or
technical errors in Horizon in the form of transaction corrections and
BTs. There is therefore little need to use privileged access to
manipulate transaction data to resolve an error — such use would be a
last resort and outside of mandated process (BTs in particular are a
deliberately engineered process to support the exceptional corrective
processing that less controlled privileged access would typically be
used for). [FJ - please provide an example of when it would be
necessary to for a Privileged User to make a change rather than a
BT]

[Changes to a branch's transaction data in the BRDB by Privileged
Users would be visible to branch staff. The amended transaction
would show up in transaction reports that can be produced in branch,
although it would not be flagged as a change by a Privileged User.]

[A key control in Horizon is the segregation of access permissions
between Privileged Users who can access the BRDB and those users
who may access the Key Management Server (KMS). The KMS holds
the digital keys that underpin the controls regarding the integrity of data
in Horizon. Segregation of Privileged Users from KMS users means
that a Privileged User cannot get around these controls and therefore
cannot cover up any changes they make in the BRDB.]

Since July 2015 all access and actions carried out by Privileged Users
are recorded to an Oracle audit table. The audit table records the
following information:

(a) User ID;

(b) action;

(c) date and time of the action; and

(d) actual SQL statement executed (where applicable).

9.3.7 While a Privileged User could alter the audit table, the alteration of
entries is recorded. This means that if an entry was removed, for
example, the fact of the removal would be visible. If the audit table
was removed, the database would stop working.

9.3.8 Prior to July 2015 the log on and log off activities by Privileged Users
were audited. The process was for a Managed Service Change (MSC)
document to be signed off and for the log on and log off records to be
attached to the MSC. [FU/!this/means that we Should provide the
MSCs to the Claimants. To discuss.]

The Transaction Information Processing Repair Tool

9.4.1 Fujitsu has provided information in relation to this tool in response to
Jason Coyne's Request for Further Information 7.4 [exhibit response
to 7.4 only]. [I confirm that this information is correct.] [Andy - is this

necessary?]

9.4.2 The tool is described in the document that Fujitsu referred Mr Coyne to
in response to RFI 7.4 (DES/APP/HLD/0020 Branch Database High
Level Design) [exhibit]. It can only be used on data that has failed to
be delivered between the Branch Database and the TPS system
because it is missing key attributes [FJ - what constitutes a key
attribute?].° This data is quarantined within the TPS system until the
Transaction Repair tool corrects it. The correction is made on the TPS
database and cannot directly affect the branch accounts in the Branch
Database (or previously, Horizon).

{FJ - are there any other ways that you can: (1) implement fixes in Horizon
that had the potential to affect transaction data or data in branch accounts;
or (2) rebuild branch transaction data?]

TRANSACTION CORRECTIONS

TCs are produced centrally by Post Office's Finance Service Centre (FSC). FSC
compares the data entered into Horizon by branches [FU What feed does Post’
Office sé? BRDB? ‘Audit Store?) with data generated by other systems in
order to identify any errors. One example of this is where Post Office compares
the data entered into Horizon in relation to Bank of Ireland ATM's with data
generated by the ATM itself.

® In Legacy Horizon the tool could only be used on data that has failed to be delivered
between Horizon locally and the TPS system.

AUDIT DATA - HORIZON ONLINE

The audit data collection and storage facilities within Horizon Online are
described in the Audit Data Collection & Storage High Level Design document
it DES/APP/HLD/0030]. As explained in that document:

fexhi

"It is essential that the Audit System can both maintain the integrity of data under
its management and subsequently be able to prove that integrity if and when the
data is retrieved for analysis."

The core audit process is described in [exhibit Fujitsu's core audit process
presentation]. By way of a high level summary of the core audit process:-

11.2.1 Transactions conducted on Horizon terminals in branches are bundled
into virtual baskets (i.e. one basket of transactions per customer) and
securely transferred over the network to the BRDB. The BRDB is
hosted on a central server farm operated by Fujitsu (there is more than
one BRDB server for resilience, and a set of gateway servers
collectively termed the Branch Access Layer (BAL) are also used).

11.2.2 Camelot, Paystation, and Post & Go transactions are conducted on
their own separate terminals (hence they are often referred to as non-
counter transactions) and accepted into the BRDB by way of
Transaction Acknowledgments (TAs) on a daily basis.(Post and Go no
longer supported — but that’s detail)

11.2.3 The BRDB holds the live version of the transaction data used in day to
day operations. Fujitsu also hosts other centralised data services to
support reporting activities which are drawn from data on BRDB.

11.2.4 The audit records in the BRDB are transferred to the audit store via the
audit server. The audit store is not involved in the live operation of a
branch or Post Office's business; it is the long term repository of audit
data. [TG:

There are a number controls in place to protect the integrity of transaction data
within Horizon (i.e. from the counter to the audit store):-

11.3.1. baskets of counter transactions:-

AC_151828144_2 8

FUJ00159545
FUJ00159545
Claim No: HQ16X01238, HQ17X02637 & HQ17X04248

(a) a basket must balance to zero (e.g. the value of payment taken or
given by the branch equals the value of goods and services provided);

(b) are atomically written (i.e. entirely or not at all) to the BRDB so that

there can be no partial baskets; and

(c) are each given a unique Journal Sequence Number (JSN) of 1 greater
than the previous transaction so that the completeness (density) of the
flow of baskets from a particular branch counter can be checked when

data is extracted from the audit store.

(d) are signed by a digital signature, which in accordance with commonly
adopted cryptography techniques, is used to secure the integrity of
transactional data once it has been initiated at the counter and allows
all transactions to be checked for subsequent interference once they
have left the counter.

11.3.2 non-counter transactions:-

(a) must be accepted into the BRDB by branch staff by way of a TA in
order to affect the branch accounts. Branch staff can obtain reports
from the Camelot, Paystation and Post & Go terminals and compare
those reports to the TAs that they are asked to accept; and

(b) The only thing that is subject to JSN is the counter transaction/basket
in which the clerk accepts the TA. The audit for the (external)
transactions that the TA covers is outside of Fujitsu’s domain. It’s
simply a record that the clerk ‘accepted’ a TA worth £x and the
implication that if he was not happy then he would complain and

resolve his concerns.

All auditable messages [(including transaction and event data)] [FU/is the
Wording in Square brackets correct?] [yes it’s correct but not all events are
auditable so there is scope for confusion — on balance happy though] are written
to a single table within the BRDB known as the “Message Log”. Each day the
previous day’s Message Log is written to a number of files which are then passed
to the Audit system which then “seals” each file and stores them until they are
retrieved (if they ever are) or deleted in line with the applicable retention period.

This seal is cryptographically generated and is based on the entire contents of
the audit file. Any subsequent change to the contents would invalidate the seal.
The seal is held in a seals database separate from the audit data. A feature of
the Audit System is that data cannot be amended or deleted until the pre-defined

“Purge Date’. [FJ - can Privileged Users not amend or delete it? If not, why
NOt?) There are software features that prevent purging before the ‘Purge Date’.
Note that we are currently holding data for longer than the standard 7 years but
the ‘Purge Date’ protection only lasts for the 7 years. I think the ‘Purge Date’ is
set at the time of writing the audit data to the audit system — will check the detail.

11.6 — [JSNs, digital signatures and digital seals are applied by the counter's private
key, [FUMisithe Wording in Square brackets Icorrect?) [No — the private key is
only relevant to the digital signature; JSNs are simple integers so the counter
simply adds one. Digital seals are wholly inside the audit system and provide
additional assurance that data has not been tampered with. The fundamental
protection comes from JSNs and the digital signatures] which is generated by the
counter as part of the log on process. A corresponding public key is included in
the log on message that the counter sends to the BAL which allows the BAL to
confirm that subsequent messages in the session come from the same counter
(Log on Message). The BAL adds a wrapper to the Log on Message which
includes a further digital signature (of the entire message including the counter's
digital signature and public key) generated by the BAL, using the BAL's private
key which is obtained from the NPS Key Store by the BAL at start-up.

11.7 Post Office Auditors may request audit data to assist with investigations in
relation to branch accounts via a process known as the ARQ process.

11.8 The components that are used to provide audit data retrieval facilities are
described in the Audit Data Retrieval High Level Design document [exhibit
DES/APP/HLD/0029].

11.9 When audit data is extracted a number of completeness and integrity checks are
carried out (FU “are these checks done automatically as a matter of
course?], Yes including:

11.9.1 each entire audit file is checked to ensure that the digital seal
described in paragraph [insert cross reference] is valid;

11.9.2 the data for the branch in question is then filtered out from these audit
files and checks are then carried out on a counter by counter basis as
described below for the period of the extract:

(a) acheck to ensure that there are no missing or duplicate JSNs is
carried out and the result of the check is recorded on the sheet
labelled "Summary" in the standard ARQ report provided to Post
Office;

FUJ00159545

Claim No: HQ16X01238, HQ17X02637 & HQ17X04248

(b) the Log on Message is checked and the digital signature generated by
the BAL is checked by using the BAL’s public key (which is known to
the audit system), which shows that this message was signed by an
application which had access to the BAL’s private key. This then
provides access to the counter’s public key for that log on session (as
this is included by the message audited by the BAL and was signed by
the BAL's private key); and

(c) All subsequent messages sent from the counter to the BAL during that
log on session are then checked to ensure that their digital signatures
are correct (using the Counter’s Public Key obtained from the Log On
message).

11.10 The number of ARQs issued since the 2014/15 financial year is as follows [FJ/>)

11.12 [FJ- what (if any) additional checks are carried out/could be carried out by

12. AUDIT DATA - LEGACY HORIZON
12.1 Riposte is [insert description].

12.2 All counter data was held in a bespoke message store (which was part of the
Riposte product supplied by Escher Inc.). This data was replicated within each
branch to all counter positions and from each branch to the data centres where it
was held in the correspondence server message stores. Similarly, any data
inserted into the message store at the data centre (for example reference data or
authorisations for banking transactions) would be replicated back to the branch
counters. Selected data was then extracted from the correspondence servers to

update Post Office's back end systems.

7 These figures do not include the ARQs that Fujitsu has issued in relation to these
proceedings.

AC_151828144_2 11
Claim No: HQ16X01238, HQ17X02637 & HQ17X04248

All accounting at the counter was carried out based on the data held in the
message store. The Riposte product managed the message store and it did not
allow any message to be updated or deleted.

Users with sufficient access permissions could inject additional messages at the
correspondence server. [FJ “why was this functionality present?)

Each message included three key bits of information which together provided a
unique identification for each message:

12.5.1 Group ID: this was the 6 digit FAD Code of the branch with which the
message was associated;

12.5.2 Node ID: this indicated the counter position at which the message was
originally written for messages generated at the counter or the
correspondence server identifier for messages generated at the data
centre. Counter node IDs were between 1 and 31 and correspondence
server node IDs were between 32 and 63; and

12.5.3 Message ID: a unique number for each group ID / node ID. This
number starts at 1 for the first message written at that node and
increased by 1 for each subsequent message, which allowed checks to
be made that no messages were missing as that would result in gaps in
the sequence of message IDs (the concept of JSNs used in Horizon

Online was based on this).

Messages also had an associated “Expiry Date” which denoted how many days
after a message was first written that it could be deleted. An archive process ran
on each counter and correspondence server at around 3am which deleted all
messages that were past their Expiry Date, thus ensuring that the message store
did not continue to grow indefinitely.

Riposte was configured such that no messages where allowed to expire until they
were at least 34 days old. This was to allow for counters that were offline for a
significant period.

Each message also had an associated CRC, which was basically a checksum
that was included to ensure that the message had not become accidently
corrupted. This was not a cryptographically secure seal.

Due to the size of the Post Office Network, branches were split into four separate
clusters and each cluster included four correspondence servers (two in each data

AC_151828144_2 12

centre), thus ensuring that there were therefore four copies of the data held in the
data centres.

12.10 An audit application was run on the correspondence servers to take an audit copy

of all data visible to that correspondence server.

12.11 The audit application was run on one correspondence server on each cluster in
each data centre. This means that there were two independent audit trails for
each branch. When retrieving the data only one audit trail was used.

12.12 The audit application read every record that was visible to that correspondence
server (i.e. all data in that cluster) and wrote a text copy of that data to a text file.
Each audit application wrote data to 10 text files (based on one of the digits in the
FAD Code). When the text file got to a certain size it was closed and a new file
created for that text stream. The file included a hash value of the file contents to
ensure that should it be accidentally corrupted, then this would be detected. At
around 1am each day the file was swapped to ensure that data associated with a
given day was in discrete files.

12.13 Once these files had been written they became visible to the audit server which
would pick them up, seal them and store them until they were retrieved or
deleted in line with the applicable document retention period. This process was
not changed for Horizon Online.

12.14 If the audit trail was retrieved, then similar checks to those carried out on Horizon
Online were made [Fd/“automatically and in the normal course of.
business?], namely:-

12.14.1 each entire audit file was checked to ensure that the digital seal stored
at the time the audit was produced (i.e. the day after the transactions
took place) was valid;

12.14.2 the data for the branch in question was then filtered out from the audit
files and checks would then be carried out on a counter by counter
basis for the period of the extract as follows:

(a) acheck to ensure that there were no missing or duplicate message IDs
for each counter / correspondence server would be carried out and the
standard audit extracts into Excel included a report indicating that this
check had been successfully carried out; and

(b) the CRC was recalculated and confirmed as correct for the message.

12.15 Any additional messages injected at the correspondence server by users with
sufficient access permissions included information including the identity of the
user. That information would not be visible in the standard audit extracts, but it
would be visible in a detailed examination of the raw audit data (FJ! Who Would!
have examined the raw audit data? Was it examined regularly?]. Further,
the node ID associated with the injected message would have been that of the
correspondence server at which the message had been injected and not a normal
counter node ID and that would have been clearly visible in any audit extract.
