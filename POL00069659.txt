Start time: Units:

I had a telephone conversation with Richard Morgan. He was calling from Australia. He
explained that he had a text from his clerks about the hearing on 11 January 2007. He said
that in his view we should adopt the position that if there was anything new from the
documents that he wanted to put to our witnesses or make any submissions about it, that he
could. If there wasn’t, then the hearing would stand and judgment should follow that day.

I agreed. I reminded Richard that it was Anne Chambers evidence that the only thing that
that document showed was the error that would not have effected the IT system at Marine
Drive in such a way as to cause the losses. In other words her evidence was that it was
irrelevant.

Also explaining to him that the spreadsheet doesn’t make a great deal of sense. It does
refer to a software upgrade on 1 April (the date that Ruth Simpson had problems balancing),
but that the upgrade took place in the evening after she would have left for the day and it is
therefore irrelevant. Reading him the few lines of the narrative. I said that I had asked
Fujitizsu to explain what that meant.

Time engaged including attendance note: 12 minutes
