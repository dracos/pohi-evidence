Subject: OFF SEN: Post Office: Ownership of Criminal Convictions Compensation
Attachment: Ownership of POL compensation scheme - June 2021.docx

Hi Eleanor, Francesca and Elena,

I attach advice about ownership of the compensation process that will be necessary in
relation to the Post Office’ Horizon case.

This follows a recent conversation between the SoS and the Permanent Secretary (who has
cleared this advice).

Many thanks,

Carl.
