I took the action to answer the question: Did any Post Office employee in Bracknell have the ability to post
transactions to the back office accounting systems.

The answer is “no”. None of these people had access to POLSAP or the system that predates it, called POL FS.

Below are be people who permanently or occasionally worked from Bracknell. We looked at access records since the
beginning of 2008 to present.

Regards, Simon
