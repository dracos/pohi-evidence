Thanks Andy,
The problem with having a call is, I think they will just start going off on data related tangents and we won't get
anywhere. I am aware Patrick is about half way through looking at the paper so will pick up in our team meeting

and let you know the outcome — thanks for taking a look.

Mark

Mark

I've now looked through this. I agree with your assessment that FJ have simply not provided the information we asked
for. Perhaps a call with FJ to run through the questions would be useful?

Kind regards
Andy

Subject: Remote Access paper - V2 returned by FJ

Hi Andy,
Attached is the Remote Access paper which was returned yesterday with (some) edits and answers provided by FJ.

To be frank, I was a tad disappointed. That said, I have been through, accepted and edited where sensible, made a
couple of further edits (tracked) and added in comments where I think we need FJ to provide further detail,

together with the type of info I would like to them to provide.

Would you mind taking a look? Perhaps then we can have a chat to discuss?
Thanks

Mark
