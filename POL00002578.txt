Hi Kendra;

{ kept the call open till we get a response from Fujitsu, PM was quite angry when I have spoken to him on Friday and my
main focus was on Friday to get this log on issue resolved asap so they can trade. After we raised the incident with
service desk , I contacted the branch within an hr and they said they were logged and trading. Pm wasn’t available.

Friday morning’s message was different then Data Centre Link error message but PM gave me the impression that they
are linked together, I am waiting a response from Fujitsu why they had this fog on message. PM was suspicious about
this message because message stated that they are already logged on but PM said nobody logged in.

When I have spoken to PM on Friday I did advise PM that I will escalate this issue to service desk . I will contact the
branch again and provide an update.

Kind Regards:
Ibrahim Kizildag ‘eam Leader

Hi Ib
Can you advise the branch that you have escalated this to ff on behalf of him and that you are unable to give any further
advice until they come back with a response. Also, fet him know you have, as requested , updated other teams in POL of

his issue.

what we need to be careful of here is bespoke services for Branches ~ he should call the desk himself for anything IT
related of this nature.

Appreciate as this is Fleckney it is on the radar but we need to ensure that we don’t over react when there is a bau issue
and therefore usual processes apply.

Can you chase ATOS for a response on Monday if no reply. Did he get the sae error code when he couldn't’ log on?

Hi Kendra;

When I have spoken to branch PM was not happy about the data centre link error message and he couldn’t fog on to
Horizon and PM gave me the impression that these issues are linked. I advised PM that this logging issue needs to be
reported to Service Desk but he declined to contact service desk so we contacted service desk and raised an incident for
this issue just before 9:00 am and I contacted branch just before 10:00 am and they said they are all logged on Horizon
and they are trading. PM was not available at that point.

{am not sure if this error code and this branch’s issues are linked ,We need this information from Service Desk, I am still
waiting a response from Service Desk, PM said someone might have logged on to horizon without their knowledge so he
wasn’t happy about the message regarding this.

I did advise PM that this issue needs to reported to Service Desk . PM did not want to speak to them and he wanted us
to escalate this issue to POL Teams. After I escalated this issue to Service Desk. I informed branch support because of
PM‘s request.

l copied Anne because of our 2™ sight meetings and PM had a horizon claim. Also this branch had a case last year.

Ibrahim Kizildag Team Leader

Hi tb

Is this the same error as last night under Error Code 0443 - REF: 17448328?

if so, it should have been included within the emails . What was the branch told as if this is the same issue it is
connected to the same error and therefore, irrespective of the view of the branch talking about Panorama, this is not

linked. Was the branch told this?

What have ATOS done in relation to this ~ have you had an update? Was Fleckney still down this morning as the issue
was apparently resolved last night? Can you please confirm .

Have you escalated this to Anne because it’s Fleckney, therefore, for information only as we should deal with the issue
under bau and not treat branches differently because they claim there is an issue. I know Fleckney is on the radar but
this should not have required an intervention request, which looks to be what you have requested.

Hi Anne;

All our Horice users are not in today. We can check it when they return to work. I have asked Service Desk to provide us
an update and I will let you know when I receive this update. They provided the following reference number; 17748328

When I have spoken to branch PM wanted this issue escalated to POL Teams , he did not want to speak to Service Desk
and he said there is a language barrier.

{think this branch raised another Horizon issue last year and I believe this case is now closed.

Hi Ib,

The outcome of the call to Atos is needed before any further action is taken it might explain
what's happened. Is there a ref number?

Has HORIce user data been cheked?

Keith,

For info this may be raised to you if you’re still in contact with Fleckney.

In brief though the recent comms statements should be used and I’ve no doubt there will be an
explanation here that’s nothing to do with Horizon.

Thanks

Hi All;

F/1377.1/4

POL00002578

I took a manager call from Fleckney Post Office, branch code is; 1972170. This branch had a Data Centre link error
message yesterday evening and PM couldn’t log on to Horizon system this morning, PM said he had a message stated
that they are logged onto another SU they only have 2 positions and nobody is logged in. The PM feels that this is a
security issue and he said someone could have log on to their system and he is not happy about this message and PM
also said he watched Panaroma programme and he wants us to escalate this issue. I escalated this issue to Service Desk,
if possible can field teams visit this branch regarding this also.
