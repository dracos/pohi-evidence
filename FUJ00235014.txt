1 Introduction

This Post Office Account User Access Guide details how access is given to both physical and IT system
assets within the Post Office Account (hereafter referred to as POA) and Fujitsu supporting functions, and
is managed by a central point, namely CSPOA.

This document sets out how access to these assets shall be created, managed, removed and how these
requirements are reported and monitored. CSPOA controls the access to systems and any asset dedicated
to POA and receives reports from other functions within Fujitsu who provide a shared service to POA.

1.1 Purpose

This document establishes the controls that POA must meet to manage user access to its assets, based
on its contractual requirements, in particular those from Schedule A4 Legislation Policies and Standards:

4.1.2 Fujitsu Services shall be compliant with ISO 27001.

4.1.3 Security for the Services, HNG-X Development, Associated Change Development and
Equipment shall be managed and organised by Fujitsu Services in accordance with the CCD
entitled POA Information Security Policy” (SVM/SEC/POL/0003) as applicable and, ...the CCD
entitled "Security Management Service: Service Description" (SVM/SDM/SD/0017).

4.1.4 Security Standards Fujitsu Services shall adhere to all parts applicable to the Fujitsu domain,
as defined in Section 2 Definitions of the CRD entitled “Community Information Security Policy for
Horizon” (SVM/SEC/POL/0005) and co-operate with Post Office to assist Post Office in complying
with this standard and requirement.

4.1.5 Data Security The confidentiality, integrity, availability, and completeness of data shall be
maintained throughout all storage, processes, and transmissions, including during periods of
Service Failure and recovery from Service Failure.

Fujitsu shall adhere to all applicable parts of the NEW Fujitsu Security Legal Register.

Controlling access to IT resources requires a combination of directive, preventive, detective, corrective,
and recovery controls that are used to manage hardware, software, operations, data, media, network
equipment, support systems, physical areas, and personnel. They involve both manual procedures and
technical controls on the IT system. The Fujitsu Europe Business Management System (EBMS) outlines
the processes to be followed to create, amend, and revoke Privileged Access for a given account. The
Fujitsu Corporate Procedures below follow EBMS:

All framework controls that POA is required to meet are detailed in full in the Fujitsu Europe Security
Policy Manual, which aligns to 1S027001:2013, and follows the Fujitsu Minimum Security Controls.

2 User System Access
2.1 Pre-requisites for allocation and removal of Access

Prior to access being requested for POA specific assets, Fujitsu HR processes for joiners and movers onto
POA, shall be followed.

For Shared Services, Assignment Managers will apply for resources via Minato according to Fujitsu
corporate procedures.

Once employment has been confirmed, the appropriate security clearance is initiated and managed by
Fujitsu Group Security. If an existing employee, then clearance will already exist. Note that there is no POA
specific security clearance required.

Once the individual has been accepted into the role, the Assignment Manager can apply for access to the
support systems to be set-up and for Fujitsu Facilities management to provide physical access to relevant
locations for the role.

If the individual fails clearance, HR and the Line Manager will be notified, and the circumstances discussed
with the POA Information Security Manager and Security Operations Manager to determine how to
proceed.

In addition, if an individual moves away from POA or leaves Fujitsu, the Fujitsu HR processes are to be
invoked by the individual's Line/Assignment Manager, and CSPOA notified, to ensure revocation of their
access from all POA specific assets.

For those individuals who are leaving Fujitsu Services completely, the Line/Assignment Manager must
follow HR policies and procedures for a termination. These can be found on NWE Connect.

All 3° party access also follows the guidance detailed in this document.

2.2 CSPOA User Database

The User Access Process on the POA is based on the creation and maintenance of a User Access
Database (Secure and Restricted access) of all personnel who work on POA.

This database is controlled by CSPOA and is maintained and updated in line with requests being submitted.
It tracks all personnel working on POA, details of the requestor, the system access they have been given,
dates access was granted and revoked and any security clearance level they have been granted. It is also
subject to a monthly review as described in section 5.1.

The database also aids any audit that may be required, by providing the details of personnel and access
levels granted.

Below is an example from the User Access Database (with redactions as necessary) showing the system
access granted to the user. Other tabs (Events, Security Info, Floor Access, MSAD and Network Drives)
will show any additional system access and security clearance.

2.3 Privileged Access Management (PAM)

Some specialist support staff require Privileged Access to be able to keep systems working, investigate
issues, and make necessary and required updates. Such access relies on PAM processes.

A privileged account has additional abilities to a "standard" user account and may include access rights
to operating systems or to application software and databases.

System privileges and levels of access required to perform management functions are higher than those
assigned to standard users. Therefore, the allocation and use of privileges is restricted and controlled,
and the principle of least privilege is used. The principle of least privilege refers to the concept and
practice of restricting access rights to only those resources required to perform the authorised activities.
Individuals are not granted unnecessary privileges.

The management of PAM accounts is completed using a variety of tools such as an Access database,
Excel spreadsheets, email, and SharePoint. A central database is held which records all access across
all environments.

Privileged Access is reviewed monthly as explained in Section 5.1.2 below.

Post Office Account User Access Guide

FUJITSU FUJITSU RESTRICTED (COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE)

The following steps must be followed:

1. The Assignment Manager shall complete the latest New User Access Form from the POA Security
Operations Portal with all required information. The completed form shall be returned to CSPOA via
email to CSPOA.Security! H
Privileged Access requests mus! e from either a Fujitsu or POL email address. All access follows
least privilege and role-based principles as outlined in Fujitsu EBMS.

Where a New User form has been completed by or on behalf of a new user (by a person other than the
Line/Assignment Manager), the Line/Assignment Manager must be copied in on the email request for
awareness and authorisation.

Below is an example of the email CSPOA receive for an individual who has joined the POA (with
redactions as necessary):

I

pete x I 95 et eH ash et fer

2. CSPOA shall check the form to ensure that it has been completed correctly, and in line with Fujitsu
Security Policy. If any information is missing or incorrect, the form will be rejected and returned to the
Line/Assignment Manager for amendment.

e A “Start Date” will be stated on the New User Access Form. However, CSPOA may receive a
completed form weeks in advance of the stated start date. In that case, CSPOA shall retain the form
and set an Outlook reminder to not process the access request until a maximum of one week prior
to the requested start date.

3. CSPOA shall email the new starter to:

e Inform them that their personal data (name and personnel number) may be shared with POL in
accordance with our obligations.

e Seek acknowledgement, and agreement for their Name and Personnel number to be supplied to
POL.

This is a GDPR compliance requirement and access to POA systems cannot be granted without this
agreement.

4. Once both the correct New User Access Form and the GDPR agreement have been received, CSPOA
shall arrange for all relevant access to be set up for the user.

5. CSPOA shall e-mail (generated from the user management database) the relevant system owners and
request user access to be set up. A TfSNow call will be raised for back-end system requirements and a
copy of the completed request form will be attached to the TfSNow call, where required. In addition,
POL and Ingenico Jira ticket(s) will be raised for Post Office Cloud and Ingenico access, where required.
NOTE - System owners must only make changes to User accounts when instructed to do so by CSPOA.

Below are examples of the emails CSPOA send to the relevant system owners for user access to be
set up (with redactions as necessary):

6. The System Owners shall follow their own processes and work instructions to configure the user access.
7. CSPOA shall then close the TfSNow call and the Jira ticket(s) and update the register.

8. Electronic copies of all forms and records are stored securely and retained for audit purposes.

4.1.1 Fujitsu Staff not on the POA

For any Fujitsu shared services staff who are provided to POA, the Line Manager shall notify CSPOA of
the relevant Assignment Manager on POA. The Assignment Manager shall then follow the process in
Section 4.1 for obtaining access to the relevant systems for the user.

4.1.2 POL Staff and 3 parties

It is the responsibility of POL to verify, authenticate, and ensure that appropriate access has been
granted to POL staff (and its 3" parties) who have been provided with access to Fujitsu systems.

The PAM processes and principle of least privilege still apply. Access should be granted as detailed in
Section 4.1, replacing Line Manager with Post Office assigned line manager.

5 Management

All access is validated monthly to ensure that the access supplied is still required and appropriate, including
standard user access for all POA systems and privileged user access for the Production environment.
Access is revoked if verification is not possible, for instance:

« When requested by Assignment Manager, and within a short timeframe, or on a date specified

¢ When verification of the continued need for access is not received

e Where roles change and access is no longer appropriate or required

« Where a user account has not been used for more than 90 days

Key steps within this User Access Procedure are reviewed, reported, and audited to ensure that it is
functioning effectively and efficiently. Below are the details of how this is achieved.

5.1 Review

The POA User Management and CSPOA Teams shall undertake a monthly review of the access granted
to individuals and its continued appropriateness.

5.1.1 Team Verification (Standard User Access Verification)

1. POA User Management Team shall produce details of all users contained in the register and their
access levels and shall email these to the relevant Line/Assignment Managers.

2. Line/Assignment Managers shall review whether the current access of their employees is still in line
with their job role.

3. Line/Assignment Managers shall consider whether any users require their access be amended and they
shall email these details to POA User Management Team within 10 working days of receipt of the
original e-mail.

4. Line Mangers shall confirm each employee's current access rights requirements and shall email these
details to POA User Management Team within 10 working days of receipt of the original e-mail from
POA User Management Team. If a response has not been received by POA User Management Team
within 10 working days, CSPOA will be informed, and users' access may be removed

5. CSPOA will audit access rights and roles with each functional area; the results of which will be presented
at the monthly Team Access Review meeting with POA User Management.

Below is an example of the Team Verification email and the System Access Report (user access levels,

regular checks of systems. These regular checks are performed on a number of selected systems each
month. The current active user account list is obtained and then compared to the central records held.
Inconsistencies are investigated and appropriate action taken. A record is kept of which system has been
checked, when, and the outcome.

provide evidence of the following for audit purposes:

1. Any Joiners, Movers and Leavers into POA follow the planned processes detailed in Section 4.
2. Only authorised individuals have access to the assets that their role requires.
3. The access provided is managed, monitored, reviewed, and controlled.

The reports and reviews can be found in CSPOA Monthly Report.
