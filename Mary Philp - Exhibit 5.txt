Dear Mary

Thank you for your email, we are looking into your enquiry and will be in touch as soon as we can.
Please do bear with us, whilst we review this.

A number of different methods were used to advise potential claimants of the scheme, including
advertisements in the press, a dedicated website, as well as letters to current and former
Postmasters that we held information for. Our records show we sent the Scheme information to the
following address in May 2020, 25 Viewforth, Leven, Fife, KY8 4PG.

We also set up the Scheme website https://www.onepostoffice.co.uk/scheme and issued public
communications which gave details of the Scheme, with access to application form and other
Scheme documents.

Kind regards

Thank you for your email.

No. | do not understand.

Can you tell me how you attempted to trace victims of the Horizon scheme?

| was not contacted -as others were- and therefore your "fairness" most certainly does not apply. How was |
supposed to find out about the scheme?

Please reply and explain.

Dear Mary

Thank you for your email about the Historical Shortfall Scheme. We are sorry it has
taken some time to provide a response but would like to assure you that your enquiry
has been considered carefully.

The Scheme was open for 3 months and closed on 14 August 2020. In addition we
allowed 15 more weeks for Postmasters with exceptional circumstances to apply.
However, this ‘grace period’ passed quite some time ago and in order to ensure that we
are able to progress those applications within the scheme in a fair and timely manner,
we are unable to accept any further applications into the Scheme.

We do recognise that this will likely be disappointing news for you but hope that you
understand the reason for our decision and wish you all the best.
Kind regards
