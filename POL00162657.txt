To see - the latest tactic.

Jane/Martine: please can we make contact today with each of these MPs by email and phone and
ask for an urgent meeting to discuss. Please also make sure we are made aware every time a new
MP signs this. I know Jane is off today Martine so please get Stuart and others involved. I'd like
contact to be made today.

Patrick: please could you adapt a version of your letter to the BIS chair for each of these MPs

I will alert BIS.

2 Hoey, Kate

2 Cunningham, Jim

2 Hopkins, Kelvin

2. Morris, Grahame M

? Vaz, Valerie
That this House notes with concern that a number of postmasters have
been forced to pay back thousands of pounds, or have been prosecuted
or imprisoned, solely on the basis of questionable data indicating cash
shortfalls from the Post Office Horizon computer system introduced in
2000; further notes that the BBC Panorama investigation on 17 August
2015, entitled Trouble at the Post Office, demonstrated the damaging
effect this has had on the lives of the postmasters involved;
acknowledges that the report by forensic accountants Second Sight into
claims many sub-postmasters were wrongly accused raises serious
questions about the integrity of the Horizon system; expresses
disappointment with the dismissive response from the Post Office to the
findings of the Second Sight report; notes the concerns raised by the
Business, Innovation and Skills Committee in the last Parliament in a
letter to the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills, dated
17 March 2015, about the approach of the Post Office to the subsequent
mediation scheme; notes the Prime Minister's comment on 1 July 2015,
Official Report, column 1477, that the internal inquiry by the Post Office
has not satisfied many hon. Members on both sides of the House;
commends the work of the former hon. Member for North Hampshire,
James Arbuthnot, for consistently raising this important issue in the last
Parliament; and urges the Government to establish a full independent
judicial inquiry.
