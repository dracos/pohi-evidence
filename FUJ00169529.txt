Subject: RE: ARQrequests
Hi Chris,

We would not put the PAN number in the witness statement. However the Witness statement would
refer to a specific ARQ Reference including FAD code, office name etc, so you could link up the
ARQ and PAN with the statement.

Contained within the ARQ data we could provide a PAN in clear but only for a specific
transaction, you would need to specific the date/time and amount for us to be able to decrypt
the encrypted PAN for the transaction you specify. We would need to fully encrypt the data as we
normally do before sending to you.

I hope that gives you want you need, if you wish to discuss further please feel free to call me.

A few point to note with regards to the ARQ’s you attached for Lower Edmonton, Westerham Avenue
and Wood Green: -

e No ARQ number have been included, please can you ad ARQ numbers are resend?

e PAN numbers have been requested but no transaction has been identified, we cannot provide
PAN numbers for the whole month sets of data, you need to specify a transaction or
transaction’s by providing the date/time/amount.

e Witness statements have been requested, please can you clarify as we only usually provide
witness statements for specific ARQ’s not all ARQ’s requested.

Many Thanks,

Jason Muir

Afternoon,
Please see the attached requests.

Question: I have been asked that when you produce a witness statement are you able to quote the full PAN number
to enable a known PAN to be matched off?
