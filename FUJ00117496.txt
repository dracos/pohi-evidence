1. Description of Change Proposed:

The NR2 Delivery Forum approved the penetration testing exercise [overview below] on
Monday 1‘ March 1999. (Penetration testing refers to both technical penetration testing and
counter penetration testing.)

The attachment to this CP includes resource, rig, timing and budgetary information provided
by Chris Wannell and Pete Dreweatt. The current Admiral assumption is that they may not be
able to complete testing by 11 July — an impact statement is required from Systems.

Technical Penetration Testing:

Admiral Management Services Ltd [AMSL] to undertake independent technical penetration
testing of ICL Pathway New Release 2 as described in their ‘Penetration Testing High Level
Test Plan’ [HLTP]. ICL Pathway Security have provided advice for the development of this
plan, which ensures that the proposed penetration testing will address the three major issues
described at [2] below. The following framework is proposed:

That ICL Pathway provides a test rig during LT2 [see attachment]. Full technical penetration
testing may then be applied in and end to end environment - fully exploiting all known, and
potential, technical fraud and denial of service weaknesses;

At the end of testing, full configuration files are to be captured from the test system. No actual
attack tests will be applied to the service in Live Trial, but test rig configuration files should
be compared to ensure the live environment is an exact duplicate of the tested system.

Testing has been scoped around known technical vulnerabilities in a card-based payment
system. The original BA-POCL ‘Threat Schedules’ have been reviewed to reflect the system
as it has evolved. These threats, together with the application of contemporary technical attack
tools, will form the framework to assure that no significant technical weaknesses exist in the
Live system.

In addition to the provision of a test environment, ICL Pathway are responsible for:

The provision of access to the test environment for the testers;

“A technical point of contact who will be available to assist the testers with such matters as
installing test tools, creating and accessing test data (including user accounts), and.
interpreting IP network addresses;

A facility for testers, on a daily basis, to verbally inform the ICL Pathway IT Security
Manager of any vulnerabilities found during testing;

(1 The design and implementation of a counter (or solution), if any, to each vulnerability
found during testing if required.

Counter Penetration Testing:

Counter Penetration Testing (CPT) is being undertaken to ensure that within reason, ICL
Pathway has identified, prior to rollout, the counter processes where it may be exposed to an
increased risk of attack from those seeking to perpetrate a fraud. The purpose is to identify
where the documented (CS/PRO/023) counter procedures, when not adhered to, potentially
open the system to fraud.

Testing is limited to NR2 functionality. The primary objectives are to determine for both
Payment Card Distribution Facility (PCDF) and Benefit Encashment Service (BES) if fraud
threats can be realised. This may be by deliberate or accidental actions of either Post Office
counter staff or BA cardholders. Once threats have been identified then further testing will be
undertaken to establish if they can be exploited.

Counter Penetration testing will need to be carried out during live trial and in a stable end to
end test environment. Logically this could be the test rig set up for the purpose of conducting
Technical Penetration testing. Transaction Management Service (TMS) records should also
be available to enable tracking of the data elements of the various test scripts.

FRM staff will undertake the testing which is anticipated to take no more than ten days.
Summary of Requirements

An end to end environment incorporating multi post office and counter positions.
Population of the environment with, users, card batch details, customer records,
payments records etc.

“ PUNS, payment cards, temporary tokens.
Support for the environment and technical backup.
Access to the TMS Journal for the system to allow the examination of events.

General:

Penetration testing is being carried out solely as an ICL Pathway activity and it is neither an
Acceptance activity nor a contractual requirement. The results of the testing will be for ICL
Pathway information only.

Following discussion with Chris Wannell, the preference is for this Penetration testing activity

to take place in Bracknell.

2. Reason for Change:

Technical Testing:
The degree of confidence provided by existing technical security testing in Bracknell is
constrained because:

Technical security testing is unit based - it is not applied in an ‘end to end’ environment.
Each test failure is assessed for business impact, but a combination of test failures across
domains may create a greater risk than the sum of the parts.

L) All testing is undertaken in a changing test rig environment. It is impossible to guarantee
that every test rig configuration will be wholly duplicated in the live environment. Any
errors or omissions may introduce security weaknesses not present in testing.

The multiplicity of SFS and ACP requirements is an indication of the system’s security
complexity. The technical test team’s reports remark on ICL Pathway’s implementation
against requirements but technical testing does not identify any unforeseen shortcomings
in ICL Pathway’s security controls.

Technical penetration testing will supplement technical security testing. No duplication of
effort will take place.

Counter Testing:

The nature of fraud is such that it constantly evolves and changes shape as those seeking to
commit a fraud change targets and modify their methods to take advantage of perceived or
identified weaknesses in systems. Counter testing is therefore solely for the purpose of

providing an additional level of assurance to ICL Pathway concerning possible fraud risks.

3. Consequences if Not Approved:

ICL Pathway will be less able to assure the absence of potentially significant weaknesses in
the Live system.

SECURITY DEVELOPMENT IMPACT (Alan D'Alvarez):I have a number of concerns with this CP evolving
around allocation of resources for this exercise.Currently, the majority of security test resource, staff and
equipment, are 'tied up’ on supporting LT2 activity until the 16th June. Alongside this, there is an urgent
requirement for scoping NR2+ security testing to enable a fully supportable end to end Security Delivery Unit
plan to be baselined within the Programme Office.There are additional issues with regard to the equipment
allocation within the various Delivery Units to support technical testing. It is currently acknowledged that there
may be a likely shortfall and activities are currently in hand to scope and address this issue. However,
Penetration Testing will be a further requirement that needs to be part of this, Who has been assigned to manage
the penetration testing exercise? Before further comment can be made, I require access to a resourced plan for
this activity to understand how it may impact on the activities I require to be completed.20.5.99

BRAOITT: Two issues/impacts. The first is on the use of the Security/SysMan test rig for pen testing. The rig
has already been earmarked for end to end volume rollout testing in this timeframe. The pen testers will probably
not want to share a rig with other testers. Furthermore the recent reorganisation has identified issues with
allocation of BRAOITT kit and personnel whose resolution will affect the implementation of this CP. Secondly,
this pen testing has a strong business element to it. The current test rig has simple arrangements for simulating
the business environment, with small numbers of payments being injected in order to test the security facilities.
Some time would have to be set aside to introduce a representative business environment, say 20 mds. (CQ)

COMMENT FROM BARRY PROCTOR/COLUM QUINN: Procter Barry:The requirement (my responsibility)
has been accepted; It strikes me that the action must now be within the Development Directorate to nominate a
Penetration Testing Manager who can resolve the kit allocation and any other
anomolies.Colum.Quinn(a)icl.com:Barry, I was surprised to be included in this action. At the PCCB I raisedthe
issue of allocation of kit because, due to the reorganisation, BRAO1TTwinds up its activities 16Jun and its
resources are being split between theDelivery Units and Business & Technical Conformance. It's not clear who
isgoing to sort this out so my understanding was that the issue was beingreferred back to you as the CP
sponsor/originator. I think the next step isfor you to identify and agree who is managing the pen testing
activity.3.6.

CUSTOMER SERVICE IMPACT (Janet Reynolds):(John Wright) Note: re Temporary Tokens, the service &
infrastructure are not yetestablished, thus DLR unable to produce TT's for any test purposes. Also amunsure
whether counters can currently process TT's. I leave you to check.(Mik Peach) The CP states that testing
facilities, rig ete will be provided,and that "Following discussion with Chris Wannell, the preference is forthis
Penetration testing activity to take place in Bracknell".On the assumption that this means the Solution Centre
rather than the SSC,then there is no impact on the SSC.If the implication is that CS need to find the rig, and
provide the requiredaccess facilities etc, then this would have a very significant impact on theSSC, and may not
be possible at all.(Barry Procter) Mik, The intention is for TSC-equivalent to host andresource these tests.(Janet
Reynolds) Zero Impact received from the following members of customerservice: Peter Robinson, Dave
Fletcher, Dave Wilcox, Mike Stewart, MikeWoolgar, Richard Brunskil.9.6.99

Risk - events have now passed this CP by - the removal of BES and PCDF invalidates the original counter test
objectives. This part of the CP needs review to ascertain whether the expenditure of resource on this activity is
viable.
