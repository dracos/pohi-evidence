To get a FAD code provided you need to contact Mark Wardle (copied into this mail).

With my previous requests to Lucy who used to provide FADs, I have usually had to also provide the following
information:

« address

*® —subpostmaster name

* office type ie SPSO

e if the fad is to replace an existing office, the existing office fad will be required

e specify that a cash account FAD code is required

Hope this helps.

Emlyn,

It appears we are making progress here.

As mentioned on the phone today the Chief Executive of the local council has written again seeking assurances this
branch will be opened by the start of the Open Golf later this month. I am pleased to see progress is being made with the
recruitment of an interim.

Mark/Kevin - can this case be progressed using new kit and a new branch code. The existing kit will have to be
quarantined somewhere as despite the current SPMR resigning to avoid termination of contract and this being accepted
without prejudice he will not withdraw his allegations re the accuracy of the Horizon kit - therefore I believe it would be
inappropriate to use existing kit until it has been fully checked out an verified as accurate - we need this evidence in case
the ex SPMR decides to take a legal case against POL.

Steve - what will happen in respect of interrogating the existing kit to demonstrate its accuracy.

If there are any issues with the above approach can you let me know - we need to get this branch reopened asap due to
current bad PR in the local press and we need to have a service in place for the influx of people to the Golf tournament.

Regards

John

Mark ,Sue has now successfully rolled over the system.
Can we progress all that is needed to set up the office for reopening even if we have to replace the kit .etc

Sue has spoken to our potential interim and has explained she will need to find staff. Sue however will discuss with Julian
the possibility of the 4 former OIC assisting as he is presently not working.

Mark .

Spmr has resigned since the audit. He was under suspension because of the inflation of cash and shortfall at audit of
£9k.He mentioned at audit the horizon concerns and stated them again in the letter I circulated recently.

Rolling over will hopefully take place tomorrow as advised in my earlier e mail .Sue Hodgins is to visit pm,around 1430-
1500 hrs.

Sue Hodgins has spoken to a Tracy Williams and she can be our interim in about a week's time if required. Obviously
cash and stock etc needs to be prdered/delivered/transferred . Clearly an interim would have to accept responsibility for
losses and Tracy is experienced enough to understand this. The issue here is if losses occurred against a suggested link
to horizon, is it fair on the interim? .As I have explained before Gaerwen was blocked albeit I had interims ready until the
system was taken out .

Mr Patel has, as mentioned already confirmed the premises are available and simply need a quick dust up and hoover to
make them ok. Shop is empty of stock and he said whoever takes it on can bring theirr own stock for the retail !!.

Subject Re: 42 day process - esc

Emlyn / Steve and all

Firstly I hope we can get the kit rolled over today or tomorrow 6th July.

Secondly : we need a consensus on whether the rolled over kit can be used, and allow us to install an interim.

We need to weigh up the cost to the business of the installation at short notice of a new kit and the configuration of this
by Fujitsu. Against this we have a closed branch, and the loss to the business this is resulting in, and the exceedingly bad
PR we will receive if we cannot open this branch in the next week or so.

Has anybody formally interviewed Mr Patel re the loss, and determined whether he is still claiming that the cause of the
loss was the Horizon system.

My understanding from brief conversations is that he instructed the OIC to inflate the cash to cover the loss, which in
itself would result is disciplinary action.

I would like to move quickly and allow an interim to be in situ asap, but need to know the following

Kevin : -- What would be the cost of replacing the current kit, and do we have facility to remove and store the current kit.
If we can remove and store who then would be responsible for arranging storage and check on the kit. Can we not test
the kit on site via Fujitsu send test signals etc.

Steve:- Do you have any plans to interview Mr Patel, and has he made any allegations about the kit to you yet ?

Emlyn : - Do we have an interim lined up and are they aware of the situation and prepared to take full responsibility for
any losses etc .

Look forward to the replies
Mark

On the stand by kit situation.

Fujitsu Services have all the equipment available etc but cannot progress on any one branch until we provide an FAD.
Their systems quite rightly cannot build an additional set of Horizon equipment on the same FAD as a branch that
already exists (system throw us an error as FAD already live) and therefore cannot provide support equipment to that
level of readiness.

Best way around this, as previously advised, is probably to obtain a new FAD and start a new build. This will then
separate the current Hoylake (and the problems the pmr claims to be having) from the new one

Karen,ex Spmr still raises issies around horizon hence our inability to reopen. When I reopened Gaerwen late last year
within a couple hours of audit, I had to close almost immediately because of a similar scenario. I then had to wait for the
kit to be removed and replaced before an interim could take over. This took weeks.

Given the lack of progress re any decision on the present kit can we arrange for someone at least to rollover asap,so we
can try to avoid any further difficulties.

I think we really should have a defitinitive protocol whereby if the integrity of the system is question we have stand by kit
to avoid this type of delay.At the end of the day its our customers who suffer etc.
