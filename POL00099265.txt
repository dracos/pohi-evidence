Fyi....we may have successfully won the argument to reduce the number of MP cases by four!

in reality this is a bit of a hollow victory as we can’t ignore these and the other MPs cases that are still trickling in — my
proposal is that these are picked up by the independent adjudicator.

That makes sense. We agree (unless Ian objects when he reads this!).

Dear Ron,
Thank you for this.

Re Simon’s request, Gail Ward (Tessa Munt MP) was submitted in May, so leave that one out. Tessa was at the meeting
last week when the deadline was mentioned, and I shall write to her letting her know that Gail Ward’s case will be part
of the next tranche of investigations. Are you content with me doing this?

Rubbina Shaheen was submitted in March, so I propose doing exactly as above.

Please confirm this is OK.

Many thanks
Janet

Janet: As mentioned, I had three ‘spare’ places in the 47 population number. That was
because of the inclusion of the two POL-supplied names and the double-counting of the Burgess-
Boyde and Ray Clarence cases that were, in truth, only one case.

Frankly, after writing my 21st May email to Simon (see attached), I'd (perhaps wrongly)
assumed that there might have been a bit of a mess-up in one or more MPs' offices (as
evidenced in Gail Ward's email to Tessa Munt) and I wanted to try to cut you all some slack to
cover that, and perhaps also to include another one or two of the JFSA referrals that we'd
pretty ruthlessly sieved. Looks like POL's caught me out!

In any event, given Tessa's enthusiasm, I'd very much like to include that Gail Ward
case. Obviously, if we drop all four of those late-arriving cases (including Gail Ward; Steve &

POL-0098848
POLO00099265
POL00099265

Megan Robinson; Rubbina Shaheen; and Doreen McQuilliam) out of the initial sample, we'd then
be down to 43... or back to 45 if we include back in the (already partially reviewed) Gill Taylor
and Jane Brewer cases submitted directly by POL without MP involvement.

Sorry about the (albeit well-intentioned) confusion.

T'll wait to hear from you before responding to Simon.

Ron
Checking this against my list. I thought we had agreed to exclude Doreen McQUILLIAM and Gail WARD as they were

submitted in May 2013 (see message attached) and would be picked up by the new review process (managed by
Alwen}

lalso do not have Steve & Megan ROBINSON and Rubbina SHAHEEN on my list. I have an email from Alan Bates where
he mentions Shaheen, but nothing from Janet. Do we have the paperwork from Janet on these two?

Note 1: See also Ray CLARENCE (JFSA-referred Case)... i.e. we had TWO
Cases submitted to us, under different names, that turned out to be just

ONE.

Note 2: See also Sara BURGESS-BOYDE (an MP-sourced Case that turned out
to be the same Case as Ray CLARENCE).

Note 3: There were TWO other Cases (Jane BREWER and Gill TAYLOR) that

were submitted directly to Second Sight by POL. Neither of these two SPMRs
involved their MP.

Hope this helps. Do you want a copy of this with the MPs' names associated with
each Case?

Best regards, Ron.

T hope all is well with you this week.

I wonder if you could possibly let me have a list of all the current cases (the 47 that keep getting mentioned!)
so that I can check names please? I am sorting out files etc. and just want to see if your records tally with
what I’ve got.

Many thanks
