3 Overview

The Network Banking Service (NBS) allows the Post Office to offer its customers financial
services from financial institutions. The system enables clerks at Post Office counters to carry
out on-line card-based banking transactions, over secure links, with the appropriate Client
financial institutions.

A full list of the applications to which each type of user is allowed access is given in the
Horizon OPS Menu Hierarchy document [Ref. SD/SPE/016].

3.1 Transaction initiation

NBS transactions are typically initiated at the counter by a magnetic card swipe. One receipt is
produced for every completed NBS transaction (with the exception of those transactions
requiring signature verification when the system produces a signature slip that is used to verify
the customer’s signature).

If the card cannot be swiped, the clerk may invoke an NBS transaction by selecting the
relevant menu item and entering the card details. Whether or not a card’s details can be
entered manually depends upon the individual card’s manual entry definition..

4 NBS transactions

NBS transactions are on-line transactions that are invoked using a magnetic card.
System rules:

e The NBS is an on-line service that will operate only when communications with the
Horizon Data Centre are available.

« When the system detects that communication with the Data Centre is unavailable, an Off-
line Indicator is displayed in a window that is overlaid over the bottom part of the screen.
It appears on the screens of any counters affected by the problem. (If the problem is a local
LAN connection this may be a single counter only. If the problem affects all external
communications in the outlet, the indicator will appear on all counters.) When the Off-line
Indicator is being displayed it is not possible to start any NBS transaction. Once the
counter communications monitoring system detects that the NBS is available again, the Off-
line Indicator is removed from the display.

The Off-line Indicator appears whilst a user is logged on over whatever screen is on
display. The indicator is removed when a user logs off, but will continue to be displayed
during a suspended session.

Description

Version: 1.0

COMMERCIAL IN-CONFIDENCE Date: 19-MAR-2003

e An NBS transaction can be initiated from the Serve Customer menu or below (excluding
the Settlement menu).

e Before the clerk can start an NBS transaction in a customer session, any previous NBS
transaction in that session must have been either abandoned or confirmed and added to the
transaction stack.

e The customer’s magnetic card must be validated as described in Section 5.2 Starting a
transaction and validating the customer's card procedure.

e The NBS transactions that are available for any particular card are governed by reference
data. Some transactions may be unavailable when a card’s details are entered manually.

e For operation types involving the entry of a PIN, the counter reference data is constructed
within the Reference Data Management Centre (RDMC) so that the Horizon counter
application makes any service of that type available only if the PIN pad has been installed.
Where an operation type is specified as permitting Signature if PIN pad not installed, the
equivalent Signature verification services will be available at an outlet only until such time
as the PIN pad has been installed in that outlet,

e For Balance Enquiry and Cash Withdrawal transactions, which require verification by
signature, the system produces two receipts. The first - the signature slip - is used to verify
the customer’s signature. The second is the customer’s receipt.

e For all PIN verification transactions, the system produces one receipt only - the customer
receipt.

e The system will not accept payment/deposit amounts that are outside the POL reference
data payment parameters for that particular transaction.

© Session transfer is inhibited for the entire duration of an NBS transaction.

e NBS transactions are not voidable (the clerk cannot use the Bin option to remove a
transaction from the stack).

e NBS transactions cannot be suspended once the card swipe has been recognised or the
clerk has selected the manual entry button to enter card details manually. From this point
onwards the Susp button will be locked, becoming available again only when the NBS
transaction has been completed and is on the stack (or is abandoned).

e The Prev button is available during manual input and the selection of a service. If selected
from the Choice of Services screen, it takes the clerk back to the Card Number screen;
from the Amount screen, it allows the clerk to abandon the transaction if the customer
does not accept the maximum or minimum value permitted.

e The Home button is available throughout manual input as a fast route to abandon the
transaction. It is locked once manual input is complete (or from the point that an NBS
card swipe is recognised) and the Choice of Services screen is displayed.

e The Home and Susp buttons are locked during recovery.

Business rules:

e Ifthe client service/product is not supported by the outlet, the clerk must advise the
customer of this fact.

e Ifthe amount tendered/requested by the customer is not accepted by the system because it
does not lie within the permitted parameters, the customer must be advised of this and
asked to amend the amount if they wish to continue the transaction.

© Office signature slips for balance enquiry transactions are not retained in the outlet and
must be destroyed and disposed of securely.

© Office signature slips for signature-based cash withdrawal transactions must be retained in
the outlet for audit purposes.

5 Transaction start and magnetic card validation

5.1 Starting a transaction and validating the customer’s card
description

NBS transactions are invoked using a magnetic card. Before an NBS transaction can be
performed, the clerk must validate the customer’s magnetic card by performing visual checks
on the card and then swiping the card through the magnetic card reader, or entering the card
details manually if the card cannot be swiped or the magnetic card reader fails (see Section
10.1 Entering card details manually and Section 11 Fallback procedures)

The system validates the magnetic card and presents the appropriate list of options based on
the reference data applicable to that card. Some options may not be available when a card’s
details are entered manually and some options are available only after a PIN pad has been
installed.

System rule:

e The Horizon system needs to be in Serve Customer mode (excluding Settlement) before an
NBS transaction can be started.

Business rule:

e It is a business decision as to whether a faulty card (or card that fails the visual checks)
should be retained — refer to the Counters Operations Manual.

5.2 Starting a transaction and validating the customer’s card
procedure

The procedure to start an NBS transaction and validate the customer’s card is as follows:

Step 1. Ensure that the Horizon system is not displaying the Off-line Indicator.

EXCEPTION A: If the counter cannot make contact with the Data Centre, the Off-
line Indicator is displayed:

e Advise the customer that you cannot perform an NBS transaction and advise the customer
of the alternatives.

EXCEPTION B: If there is a LAN problem and a counter has become disconnected
from the network, the affected counter will display the Off-line Indicator:

Proceed as follows:

SCENARIO B.1: If not all counters are affected and it is possible to perform the
transaction at another counter position:

¢ Move to the counter position and undertake the transaction there.

SCENARIO B.2. If it is not possible to perform the transaction at another counter
position:

e Advise the customer that you cannot start an NBS transaction and advise the customer of
the alternatives.
Step 2. Obtain and check the customer’s card — refer to the Counters Operations
Manual.
EXCEPTION A: If the card does not pass the visual checks:

« Advise the customer that the card cannot be accepted - refer to the Counters Operations
Manual.

e This ends the transaction.

Step 3. Swipe the card.

EXCEPTION A: If the card is not read, swipe the card again up to a maximum of
THREE times, then:

e Enter the card details manually (see Section 10.1.2 Entering card details manually
procedure).

6 Balance Enquiry transactions

6.1 Balance Enquiry (Signature) description

In the case of a Balance Enquiry (Signature) transaction, the system produces both an office
signature slip that is used for signature verification and a customer receipt.

For signature failure, in the absence of a prompt from the system to retain the card, the clerk
returns the card. For card check failures, the system declines the transaction but will prompt
the clerk to retain the card only if instructed to do so in a response from the card issuer.
Otherwise the transaction is declined and the card returned to the customer.

Business rule:

8 Cash Withdrawal transactions

8.1 Cash Withdrawal (Signature) description

The system produces an office receipt that is used as a signature slip. The clerk asks the
customer to sign the signature slip and after verification has been completed, the clerk retains
the slip.

A balance may or may not be provided on the receipt. This depends upon whether the
transaction has been approved or declined and whether the card issuer provides a balance with
a Cash Withdrawal transaction.

For signature failure, in the absence of a prompt from the system to retain the card, the clerk
returns the card. For card check failures, the system declines the transaction but will prompt
the clerk to retain the card only if instructed to do so in a response from the card issuer.
Otherwise the transaction is declined and the card returned.

Fees charged by card issuers to their customers for this service are not collected at the point of
sale, as collection of fees is a card issuer to customer issue.

Business rule:

¢ Once the clerk has checked the signature slip, they must retain it in the outlet for audit
purposes.

8.2 Cash Withdrawal (Signature) procedure

A customer’s card must be validated as defined in Section 5.2 Starting a transaction and
validating the customer's card procedure before performing a Cash Withdrawal (Signature)
transaction.

The procedure to perform a Cash Withdrawal (Signature) transaction is as follows:
Step 1. From the Choice of Services menu, select the Cash Withdraw option.
(The system displays the Amount screen.)
EXCEPTION A: If you decide not to proceed with the transaction:

8.3. Cash Withdrawal (PIN) description

The customer enters their PIN at the PIN pad once the withdrawal amount has been captured
Verification is performed by the card issuer rather than the clerk. Refer to the CSR+ Operating
Environment PPD [Ref. CS/PRO/097] for a description of PIN pad use.

A balance may or may not be provided on the receipt. This depends upon whether the
transaction has been approved or declined and whether the card issuer provides a balance with
a Cash Withdrawal transaction. If the transaction is declined for the reason of insufficient
funds, a balance may be printed on the receipt if the card issuer wishes this facility to be
provided.

For card check failures, the system will prompt the clerk to retain the card only if instructed to
do so in a response from the card issuer. Otherwise the transaction will be declined and the
card returned.

Fees charged by card issuers to their customers for this service are not collected at the point of
sale, as collection of fees is a card issuer to customer issuc.

System rule:

e The PIN pad must have been installed and be available.

8.4 Cash Withdrawal (PIN) procedure

A customer’s card must be validated as defined in Section 5.2 Starting a transaction and
validating the customer's card procedure before you can perform a Cash Withdrawal (PIN)
transaction.

8.5 Withdraw Limit (Signature) description

The system produces an office receipt that is used as a signature slip. The clerk asks the
customer to sign the signature slip and, after verification has been completed, the clerk retains
the slip.

For signature failure, in the absence of a prompt from the system to retain the card, the clerk
returns the card. For card check failures, the system declines the transaction but will prompt
the clerk to retain the card only if instructed to do so in a response from the card issuer.
Otherwise the transaction is declined and the card returned to the customer.

Fees charged by card issuers to their customers for this service are not collected at point of
sale, as collection of fees is a card issuer to customer issue.

Business rule:

e Once the clerk has checked the signature slip, they must retain it in the outlet for audit
purposes.

8.6 Withdraw Limit (Signature) procedure

A customer’s card must be validated as defined in Section 5.2 Starting a transaction and

The clerk performs card fraud checks before the system goes on-line. If the clerk response on
the Card Checks screen indicates that the card has failed the checks (clerk selects Cross
option), the transaction will be declined and the customer receipt will indicate that the card has
been returned.

System rule:

e When a customer undertakes the procedure to change their PIN, the card issuer validates
the original PIN and checks to see whether the new PIN that the customer has entered is
acceptable. (The Horizon system does not know whether the original PIN is correct or
not; it relies on the validation performed by the card issuer.)

Business rule:

© There are no automatic timeouts on customer entries. The onus is on the clerk to cancel
the operation if the customer is unwilling or unable to complete the PIN pad entry.

9.2 Change PIN procedure

A customer’s card must be validated as defined in Section 5.2 Starting a transaction and
validating the customer’s card procedure before you can assist a customer to change their
PIN.

The procedure to assist a customer to change their PIN is as follows:

Step 1. From the Choice of Services menu, select the Change PIN option.
(The system displays the Card Checks screen and a message that asks you to check
that the card number on the card (if available) is the same as displayed and to check
the card for evidence of fraudulent tampering. It also asks whether the card passes all
fraud checks [Message NBS:MSG829].) Note: the card number is not present on
all cards.

EXCEPTION A: If you have selected an option that was marked on the Choice of
Services menu as being not available, the system displays a message saying that the
option you have selected is not available [Message NBS:MSG803]:

¢ Select the Tick option.
(The system re-displays the Choice of Services screen.)

SCENARIO A.1: If you selected the option by mistake:

¢ Select the correct option from the menu.

10.2Re-printing an NBS transaction receipt

10.1.1 Re-printing an NBS transaction receipt description

A customer copy receipt is produced automatically by the system for every committed
NBS transaction. However, should there be any problems with the system-produced
receipts (for example, torn receipts or illegible receipts), you can re-print a receipt as
many times as necessary prior to settling the customer session.

If the customer receipt is not acceptable (e.g. printing too faint or paper jam) and the
problem will take too long to correct during the current customer session, then the
printer should be switched off. The clerk should then repeat the receipt re-print
command. The system will automatically detect the printer failure and will produce a
print preview so that the information can be copied manually to produce the receipt.

System rules:

e A reprint (copy) receipt for the customer session can be printed provided that the
session has not been settled.

e@ Once the NBS transaction is on the stack, the clerk can transfer the session to
another counter (if available) to reprint the receipt.

10.1.2 Re-printing an NBS transaction receipt procedure
The procedure to reprint an NBS transaction receipt is as follows:

Step 1. From the Desktop, select the Transaction option, the Serve Customer
option, the Functions option, then the Reprint Receipt option (or press
the RECPT key after the first copy of the receipt has been printed and
before the session has been settled).

(The system displays a pick list showing the transactions in the current
customer session.)

Step 2. From the displayed pick list, select the NBS transaction for which you
wish to reprint a receipt.
Note: a pick list is displayed because the EPOSS facilities are used to re-print
the NBS receipt before the session is settled. EPOSS does not know
automatically what to print (it could be the session receipt or any transactions
within the session) and for this reason the system displays a pick list.

Step 3. Select the Select option.
(The counter printer prints the receipt.)

11 Fallback procedures

This section deals with the procedures that must be undertaken in order to serve the customer
in the event of equipment failure within the post office. The following types of equipment
failure will affect the processing of NBS transactions:

© Magnetic card reader failure

e Counter printer failure

¢ Keyboard failure and touch screen failure
e PC failure — Single-counter office

© PC failure — Multi-counter office

e Network — ISDN connection

¢  Site-related failures

11.1Magnetic card reader failure

Magnetic card reader failure will affect all NBS transactions.

11.1.1 Manual entry of card details

In the event of magnetic card reader failure, NBS transactions may be undertaken at another
counter position (if available) or the transaction may be undertaken as described in Section
10.1.2 Entering card details manually procedure.

11.2Counter printer failure

Counter printer failure will affect all NBS transactions as receipts are a mandatory requirement
for these transactions.

11.2.1Producing manual receipts in the event of printer failure

In the event of printer failure, the Print Preview facility is available to display the receipt
information to enable the production of a manual receipt.

For the procedure to produce a manual receipt, refer to the Counters Operations Manual.

11.3Keyboard failure and touch screen failure

For the fallback procedures for keyboard or touch screen failure, see the CSR+ Operating
Environment PPD [Ref. CS/PRO/097].

11.4PC failure

(‘PC’ refers to the PC itself plus the internal cards and monitor.)

This section deals with the fallback procedures that must be undertaken when PC failure
occurs in a single-counter or a multi-counter office.

If a PC fails in mid-customer session, the system invokes session recovery procedures at the
first logon to the counter by a user who has access to the Transactions menu (see Section 12
NBS Recovery and Section 12.2 Recovering incomplete transactions).

11.1.1PC failure (single-counter office)
In the event of PC failure in a single-counter office, NBS transactions cannot take place.

11.1.2PC failure (multi-counter office)

In the event of a single PC failure in a multi-counter office, business should be directed to the
other counter(s).

Gateway PC failure will affect all NBS transactions. If the Gateway fails, the Off-line Indicator
will be displayed and NBS transactions will be unavailable.

Office LAN failure may affect one or more counters. The Off-line Indicator will be displayed
on affected counters. NBS transactions can be performed at unaffected counters.

In the event of all the PCs failing (due to complete loss of power, for example), NBS
transactions cannot take place.

Note: Once the failure has been rectified, recovery procedures may need to be undertaken as
described in Section 12.2 Recovering incomplete transactions.

12 NBS Recovery

The NBS generates and uses recovery messages to drive the recovery process. The system
generates a recovery message at the point where a transaction becomes irreversible and a
customer receipt has been produced (either printed by the counter printer or created manually
by the clerk copying the details from the receipt preview screen).

Recovery takes place when the first clerk logs on to the repaired or replaced counter PC. The
user access is now checked. If the user has access to the Transactions menu, recovery can take
place. If the user does not have access to the Transactions menu, recovery will be deferred
until a user logs in who does have access to the Transactions menu.

There are two types of recovery, automatic and manual:

« Automatic recovery
The system performs automatic recovery for transactions for which recovery messages
exist. Automatic recovery is invisible to the user.

e Manual recovery
Manual recovery (which takes place after automatic recovery) relates to a transaction for
which the system does not have a recovery message (and therefore cannot determine
whether the transaction was confirmed or declined). The system presents the clerk with the
Recovery screen as described in Section 12.2 Recovering incomplete transactions. Debit
Card transactions use the same process and therefore the Recovery screen may prompt for
either NBS or Debit Card transactions for completion.

System rules:

¢ The recovery process for NBS is based on recovery messages written when a transaction
is completed. For transactions with financial effect, a recovery message is written to the
message store after the customer receipt has been printed successfully. Non-financial
transactions are recovered automatically.

«The system gathers much of the information required to perform recovery during system
load, with automatic recovery occurring at logon.

e  Ifthere are transactions requiring manual recovery, the system will prompt the clerk to
perform manual recovery when they log on to a counter PC after it is restarted. The clerk
cannot postpone the recovery process.

« NBS recovery does not require on-line facilities and so may go ahead even if the system is
offline.

e When a transaction is declined, a null confirmation message is written to the message store
immediately after the clerk or system declines the transaction. Recovery for such a
transaction will occur without the clerk’s involvement.

¢ Transactions are recovered into the original stock unit but are associated with the
currently logged in user.
Note: The association of recovered transactions to the current user has an effect on the By
User reports.

In the case where a session is successfully transferred to another terminal with NBS
transaction(s) on the stack, recovery takes place at the terminal to which the session was
transferred and not at the terminal where the transaction was initiated.

Recovery sessions cannot be suspended or transferred.

Recovery and stock unit/CAP rollover are not linked. If recovery takes place after
rollover, the data will be in the next CAP.

Business rules:

The clerk must make a manual record of transaction details for any NBS transaction being
undertaken when there is a counter PC failure.

Clerks need to ensure that all NBS manual records are readily available should they be
required for NBS recovery. This will entail keeping them in a central location and ensuring
that they are not locked in an individual till overnight

12.1 Recording NBS transaction details manually when a counter

PC fails

If the counter PC fails during an NBS transaction with financial effect (all deposit and
withdrawal transactions) before the system has produced a customer receipt (or you have
created a manual customer receipt from the receipt preview screen), you must proceed as
follows:

Step 1. Create a manual record containing the following transaction details:

e Date

¢ Time

¢ Card number (first four and last four digits only; show the middle digits as ‘X’s )
¢ Transaction ID (if known)

¢ Type of transaction

+ Value

e Outcome (transaction confirmed or declined)

e Stock unit ID

e Node ID

Step 2. Store the manual record safely in a central location where it will be readily

accessible when the faulty counter PC is restored to working order.

12.2Recovering incomplete transactions

12.2.1 Recovering incomplete transactions description

When the counter PC is restored to working order, automatic recovery takes place as soon as
you log on to the system. If there is any recovery that requires your involvement, you are
prompted with details of the first transaction requiring recovery and asked to indicate whether
money was exchanged during the transaction. You must use the manual record(s) (created by
the clerk using the system when the failure occurred, as described in Section 12.1 Recording
NBS transaction details manually when a counter PC fails) to enable you to indicate to the
system the outcome of any incomplete transaction(s).

12.2.2 Recovering incomplete transactions procedure

The procedure to recover incomplete transactions is as follows:
Step 1. Obtain all manual records created at the time when the counter PC failed.

Step 2. Log on to the affected counter.
(If there are NBS transactions that can be recovered automatically, the system
performs automatic recovery.)

Step 3. Is the system displaying the Recovery screen with details of an NBS transaction
and a message asking you whether cash was exchanged due to this transaction
[Message NBS:MSG805]?

SCENARIO A: If the system is not displaying the Recovery screen:

e This ends the procedure.
SCENARIO B: If the system displays the Recovery screen:

e Examine the transaction details shown on the screen.

e Proceed to step 4.

Step 4. Can you match the transaction shown on the Recovery screen with a manual
record created by the clerk at the time when the counter PC failed?
SCENARIO A: If you can match the transaction on the screen with a manual record:
Proceed as follows:

SCENARIO A.1: If the manual record indicates that cash was exchanged in the
original transaction:

© Select the Tick option.

e Proceed to step 3.

SCENARIO A.2: If the manual record indicates that cash was not exchanged in
the original transaction:

© Select the Cross option.

e Proceed to step 3.

SCENARIO B: If you cannot match the transaction on the screen with a manual

record, the lack of a manual record indicates that the failure did not occur during a
stomer session and therefore you can assume that the transaction was completed
fully:

¢ Select the Tick option.

e This ends the procedure.
