Hi all

Thought it would be helpful to set things out as I see them at present.

J Arbuthnot statement: has landed and is about 50 times better than it could have been: highly complimentary of PO.
Some issues in it, which I have raised with his office and they are considering. His office let slip that they are sending

statement and report to BBC before 6pm.

Stakeholders: Mike is speaking to Consumer Futures. RMG briefed. Angela VDB speaking to CWU and CMA at cSpm
(thanks Sophie). I will email statement to NFSP shortly (have briefed Paul Hook on the phone).

lam attending meeting this evening with an external lawyer. We won’t do interviews.

Internal: Richard/Richard: my instinct is that this doesn’t merit a ‘special’ release to internal channels at this stage (we
can review tonight). Please can you let me know who to speak to later if we need to change. I do want NBSC to be
briefed this afternoon though. Can this be arranged?

I think that’s it for now.

Views welcome.
