Fine.

Then we must be clear about this in this board paper or commentary. I really don’t want us spending loads of
time in the board on “risks to UKGI”!

Yes.

There was no evidence pointing to anything but a problem with the Horizon system. Furthermore POL was ina
process of mediation for some cases and the legal route was open as a way to establish the facts in others.

In short, a matter for the company and the courts.
