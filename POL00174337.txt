Subject: RE: PANORAMA PLANNING

Mark, Mel,

I have tracked my comments and added in the information requested from me.

This feels like a comprehensive plan and I don’t see any gaps at this stage.

I suppose the trick will be to be as factual as possible in our external comms and indeed
our lines to our colleagues and postmasters otherwise we could be accused of “he doth

protest too much”. In your capable hands - you’ve steered us well on this topic to date.

Thanks,
Angela
