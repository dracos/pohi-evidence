SUMMARY OF WORK:

The purpose of this CT is to extend the suspension of the Audit and related Service Incident
data purging activity (the arrangement for which ended on the 31“ August 2015) until the 31*
March 2017. Data purging may recommence should Post Office Ltd not agree to these
Commercial Terms.

RELATED WORK PACKAGE DESCRIPTION:
(the “WORK PACKAGE”)

Post Office Ltd, via Change Request DM0027689v0.1, have stated that the existing
arrangement for Fujitsu to suspend data purging ended on the 31st August 2015. The
arrangement was put in place in May 2014 as part of the Branch Support Programme (the
programme closed in March 2015), and Post Office Ltd have a requirement to continue with the
suspension through to the 31st March 2017.

Fujitsu currently have a tactical fix in place to stop the daily data purging job from running,
and these Commercial Terms (CT) are to provide cover to extend that tactical fix through to the
31“ March 2017.

The charges in this CT cover the effort involved in extending the existing tactical fix only.

Fujitsu would like to bring to the attention of Post Office Ltd that an alternative more secure
solution is available, with the implementation of ‘Eternus Dataguard’. This solution would be a
permanent one to remove the job from the daily schedule, and to introduce ‘Eternus Dataguard’
onto existing records. This will provide additional security, ensuring that the records cannot be
deleted before they are due to expire. It should be noted though that the Eternus Dataguard
solution does not form part of this response, however Post Office Ltd are welcome to request
this via an additional CR.

PAYMENT PLAN/TERMS OF PAYMENT:

The man-days and man-hours (as appropriate) in respect of each activity under this CT will be
charged on an ‘actuals’ Time and Materials basis including where work is required to rectify
failures to meet any Acceptance Criteria as listed in this CT and with the Other Charges will be
invoiced monthly in arrears. Payment by Post Office Ltd is due within 30 days of receipt of
invoice.

This CT was impacted based on an activity estimate to deliver the associated Post Office Ltd
RWP/CR and no contingency provision has been included. It is possible that the actual effort
required to deliver this CT will exceed the estimate and, should this occur, Fujitsu will raise a
separate CT to cover the additional spend unless Post Office Ltd has pre-agreed funding for
likely risk elements.

Fujitsu will use reasonable endeavours to give Post Office Ltd early notification if the estimated
Time and Materials are likely to be exceeded and a further Work Order is required.

For the avoidance of doubt, the amounts estimated in respect of individual activities defined in
“Gross Price’ (above) may be exceeded, providing the total estimate in ‘Gross Price’ is not
exceeded.

Notwithstanding any rates listed in these CTs, charges will be invoiced at the rates applicable in
the Financial Year in which the service is provided.

All sums payable under these Commercial Terms are stated exclusive of VAT.
