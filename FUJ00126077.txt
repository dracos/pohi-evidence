Andy

Mike Young called me this morning. He told me that they are now growing in confidence that we will deliver the
programme in accordance with the latest plan.

They believe that integration testing is going well and are looking to review the roll out programme once integration testing
has been completed.

He reminded me that we owe them a commercial proposal around LDs and reimbursement of their costs. I explained that
David is away on holiday until next Tuesday but that I would speak with him then and was confident that we would get a
proposal to him by the end of next week.

It was a friendly call and it looks like relationships between our 2 teams are improving. Well done.

Regards

Peter
