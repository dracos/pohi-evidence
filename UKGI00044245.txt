Where we have offered a view on the impact on Post Office, this an initial view based on our current knowiédge and we have not sought'to sét out an exhaustive list of
impacts. We also note that the Common Issues are not discrete topics and there will be interplay between them. Success or failure on some points may lead to
success or failure in other areas. Further, if multiple common issues are lost, they may have a compound effect greater than the risks identified below.

In preparing this risk assessment, we have not yet considered any mitigating actions that may be taken.

Relational Contract Summary: Counsel is satisfied overall that Post Office is likely to succeed on this issue.
Was the contractual relationship between Detail: There is some risk on this issue for Post Office due to:

Post Office and Subpostmasters a . a .
“relational contract'/ A) This area of law being in a state of development;
fe . B) The way each party is dependent on the close cooperation of the other, which puts a query
If so, this would mean that Post Office was a Pa re
subject to duties of good faith, fair dealing, over how the Subpostmaster relationship operates in practice;

transparency, co-operation, and trust and C) An imbalance of bargaining power and level of sophistication between Post Office and the
confidence? Subpostmasters; and

D) The SPMC and NTC having several characteristics of relational contracts, and the SPMC in
particular not being particularly well drafted.

If the court were to find that they were relational contracts, this doesn't necessarily mean that the
"good faith term" should be automatically implied. Counsel's view is that it would be wrong to
imply a term as to good faith into the SPMC and NTC.

However, there is a significant question mark over what good faith actually means. It could be
limited to whether Post Office acts honestly or the meaning could be taken further to mean
putting Subpostmaster's interests above Post Office's interests.

Impact:

. Post Office will be required to carry out more checking of its decision to make sure
they align with the “relational contract’, and will need to ensure its process adheres
to that standard, which will require time and have a cost to it.

. Post Office may need to balance acting in own best interests against

Subpostmaster's interests. This would fetter Post Office's ability to run and evolve
the business in the way it sees fit

terms (or incidents of such implied terms) of Detail: The Claimants are attempting to imply 21 terms into the contract. They are referenced
the contracts between Post Office and below grouped in themes rather than the 21 specific terms.

>
SUESSINEES To dissuade the court that the 21 implied terms need incorporating into the contracts, Post

Office has admitted two implied terms, which in Counsel's opinion render the additional implied
terms unnecessary (the Stirling v Maitland Term and the Necessary Cooperation Term).

However, there are no guarantees about how the Managing Judge will address each and every
implied term.

As matters stand, there are some arguments on the implied terms which are finely balanced. For
example, the court may think it a small step to agree to a mutual duty to maintain trust and
confidence in a business to business, agency relationship.

If some of the implied terms are accepted, these may have a practical effect on requiring Post
Office to do things which are not currently required by the contracts.

Impact: See below which categorises the 21 implied terms into groups of similar terms and
then provides commentary on each grouping.

CLAIMANTS IMPLIED TERMS

Implied term:
Exercise of powers 1

[In relation to (i) contract variations and (ii)
withholding Subpostmaster remuneration
during suspension.]

Post Office would exercise any power
(under the contracts or generally) honestly
and only for the purpose the power was
created to achieve.

Post Office will not exercise a power
arbitrarily capriciously or irrationally.

Note: This issue has been split into two parts because it depends on which express terms are
being considered.

Post Office has a high degree of freedom when deciding to (i) vary the Subpostmaster Contracts
and (ii) withhold Subpostmaster remuneration during suspension. Counsel has advised that the
Court is likely to place some restrictions on these discretionary powers, namely that these
powers should not be used arbitrarily, capriciously or irrationally.

Impact

. Post Office will need to pro-actively consider and document in every case
whether remuneration should be withheld during a period of suspension. This
could lead to significant back-claims for withheld remuneration. Going forward this
could be remedy with a process change to approve and document these

decisions.

. It is considered unlikely that Post Office would vary the Subpostmaster Contracts
without careful consideration. More effort may be required to document these
decisions.

Implied term:
Exercise of powers 2
[All other terms of the contracts]

Post Office would exercise any power
(under the contracts or generally) honestly
and only for the purpose the power was
created to achieve.

Post Office will not exercise a power
arbitrarily capriciously or irrationally.

Counsel is satisfied that Post Office's other powers under the Subpostmaster Contracts (eg.
power to terminate) are unlikely to be fettered by these implied terms.

Impact

. If this implied term does apply to other powers under the contracts (eg. right to
terminate) this may slow down decisions and actions (eg. delay suspensions) and
therefore cause losses to increase in branches.

. It would give Subpostmasters wide grounds on which to challenge many
decisions on Post Office.

. Post Office would need to document decisions so to prove that they are not
arbitrary or irrational. It should be noted that the threshold for irrationality is very
high — a decision needs to be completely perverse for it to be classed as
irrational. The greater risk is that the decision looks arbitrary or capricious
because Post Office is not able to point to any audit trail on its decision making.

GB

Implied term:
Quality of Horizon

Post Office would provide a system which
was reasonably well suited to its designated
purpose, including:

A) error repellency
B) error prevention
C) error detection/ identification

D) a way to report errors to the Horizon
user

The system should be able to deal with
errors both at the:

4) data entry level; and

2) system level.

The system should be able to carry out:

i) data processing,

ii) carrying out the relevant transaction; and
iii) reconciling transactions.

The system should also record any error
issues as listed in points A — D above.

Impact

_lf Horizon does this already, then this implied term will have minimal impact.

If Horizon does not meet these standards, Post Office would need to liaise with
Fujitsu as to whether such changes to Horizon are achievable and if so, the cost of
implementing them.

If changes to Horizon were made, Post Office may need (depending on those
changes) to roll out a training programme to Horizon users.

Post Office would need to bear in mind the audience it was communicating to, as
Subpostmasters may not necessarily understand technical error reports. There
may need to be an additional team in place to interpret Horizon reports into a user
friendly format.

Implied term:

Communication of ability to alter branch
data

Post Office would not hide from
Subpostmasters its ability to:

A) alter data remotely;

Impact

This is probably a one off communication to Subpostmasters with some new
internal training for staff. There may be some minor changes to day to day
working of Post Office so to ensure that a consistent message is given about the
functionality of Horizon.

10. Implied term:
Reasonable skill and care

Post Office would supply its support
services to Subpostmasters (eg. back-office
accounting, the Helpline, training, etc.) with
reasonable skill and care.

Impact

We do not have a holistic view of Post Office's business to provide an exhaustive
comment, but those parts of the business we have studied have generally operated
with reasonable skill and care.

Any areas requiring improvement would incur costs of change.

At present, any failure to exercise reasonable skill and care is a commercial problems
only. If this term is implied, each failure is a breach of contract that could lead to
claims by Subpostmasters for any losses caused to them.

Implied term:
Shortfalls
Post Office would:

A) produce, keep and maintain accurate
records of all transactions carried out using
Horizon;

B) be able to explain all relevant
transactions;

and

C) use the records to explain any shortfalls.

Post Office would co-operate in trying to:

A) identify the possible or likely causes of
any shortfalls without any input from the
Subpostmasters and/or

B) work out whether or not there was any
shortfall by carrying out a formal
investigation

C) prove as a result of the investigation that
the shortfall was properly attributed to the
Subpostmaster under the contract.

Post Office would not seek recovery of any
shortfalls from the Subpostmasters unless
and until:

A) it had complied with its duties (which
include the duties in the implied terms);

Impact

This would reverse the current responsibilities between Post Office and
Subpostmasters in relation to losses.

Post Office would need to put processes in place to enable it to explain all
transactions and shortfalls.

This would make recovery of losses in branches very difficult if not impossible in
many cases.

sessions, a greater amount of more detailed training material, consideration of the
form of training and a way to track whether the training provided had been properly

Subpostmaster assistants.

a i seule ltl The key question is whether Post Office had a contractual obligation to provide Horizon, the

and skill, pursuant to section 13 of the Helpline and training as."services".

Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982? I The Claimants have not identified any specific contractual provision in which they say Post
Office assumed an obligation to provide a service. However, there is scope for an argument on
this point.

The key concern is with the NTC, in which there is a possible provision that the Claimants
could say means that Post Office had an obligation to provide the Helpline.
Impact
. This is what Post Office are arguably doing already. If Post Office was required to
act beyond its current practice, it would need to assess the impact of any decisions
regarding the "services" when making any changes to the provision of "services" or
the content of the services
° Post Office would face issues if it was under an obligation to provide the "services"
if there was an outage with Horizon, if access to the training/materials or the
Helpline was unavailable due to a glitch, as Post Office would be liable for making
sure Subpostmasters had access to these services.

UKG100044245

Whether this is an issue for Post Office will mostly be on a fact specific basis for each
Subpostmaster, as generally the practice seemed to be that contracts were provided to
Subpostmaster before the agreements were entered into.

Impact
. If terms are "unusual or onerous”, they would be unenforceable against
Subpostmaster. If this applied to business critical terms such as termination,
suspension and loss recovery then this would have a critical impact on the
relationship with Subpostmasters, albeit likely limited to those Subpostmasters who
never saw their full contract terms before becoming a Subpostmaster.
. Going forward, Post Office needs to improve its contract origination processes,

with clear evidence of Subpostmasters being given access to, and time to
understand, their contract terms.

Liability for Losses

What is the proper construction of section 12,
clause 12 of the SPMC?

Clause 12 states "The Subpostmaster is
responsible for all losses caused through
his own negligence, carelessness or error,
and also for losses of all kinds caused by
his Assistants. Deficiencies due to such
losses must be made good without delay."

What is the proper construction of Part 2,
paragraph 4.1 of the NTC?

Para 4.1 states: "The Operator shall be fully
liable for any loss of or damage to, any Post
Office Cash and Stock (howsoever this
occurs and whether it occurs as a result of
any negligence by the Operator, its
Personnel or otherwise, or as a result of
any breach of the Agreement by the
Operator) except for losses arising from the
criminal act of a third party (other than

Summary: Post Office is likely to succeed on the major issues arising out of the construction of
these clauses.

See also the comments above in relation to implied terms regarding shortfalls.

NOTE: This is a high level summary. This area is highly nuanced and complex and needs
further significant work.

The major challenge on these clauses whether for a "loss" to be recoverable it needs to be a
real financial loss to Post Office or whether it can be an accounting loss in a postmasters
accounts. The difficulty with the former is that Post Office would need to track the loss in a
branch accounts and show how that loss caused it real financial detriment. This would require a
significant forensic accounting exercise, tracing a loss through all Post Office's back-office
accounting systems.

Impact

. Losing this point would make it very difficult for Post Office to recover losses without
significant effort and details investigation into every loss in every branch.

Subpostmaster as Agent

Was the extent and effect of the agency of
Subpostmasters to Post Office such that the
principles of agency applied as Post Office
argues?

Did Subpostmasters, as agents, bear the
burden of proving that any Branch Trading
Statement account they signed and/or
returned to Post Office was incorrect?

I Detail: It is clear that Subpostmasters are agents of Post Office. There is more scope for
__I argument about what agency duties apply to Subpostmasters. Post Office asserts that the
I following agency duties apply.

: "I Post Office;

Summary: Counsel's overall opinion is that Post Office is likely to win on this argument that
Subpostmasters owed duties to Post Office, that they were bound by their accounts and that if
they made false accounts, they are also bound by them.

(a) As its agents, Subpostmasters owed fiduciary duties to Post Office and a duty to account to

+ — Losing this point would make recovery of losses more difficult as Post Office could no

22. I Termination on Notice Summary: On the face of it there is no legal reason why the 3 (SPMC) and 6 month (NTC)
notice periods should be construed any differently than as they are set out in the contract, as the

words are plain and clear.

Detail: Counsel does not consider that the court will read in a requirement, as requested by the
Claimants, that Post Office must "conscientiously consider what period of notice to give".

On a proper construction of the SPMC and
NTC, in what circumstances and/or on what
basis was Post Office entitled to terminate on
notice, without cause?

However, Counsel is concerned with the 3 month notice period, as this is a very short notice
period for agreements of this kind. The Judge may have some sympathy with the Claimants on
this point and may seek to moderate the contract in some way on this point eg. by extending the
notice period.

Counsel is less concerned with the 6 month NTC notice period.

Note: the Claimants also seek an implied
term in relation to termination on notice.

Belcher [2011] UKSC 41)?

If not, was the “true agreement” between the
parties as alleged at GPOC, para. 71?

Summary: This is the Claimant's alternative formulation for its arguments in relation to
termination rights. In essence, the Claimants are saying that the standard Subpostmaster
Contracts are a sham and should be ignored. Instead, Post Office should not be able to
terminate on less than 12 months' notice.

Counsel thinks Post Office will win this point. Counsel's view is that Post Office is likely to
succeed on the true agreement issue because:

a) the Autoclenz principle is of limited application as the dispute does not focus on employment
status

Paragraph 71 alleges that the “true
agreement” was that termination had to be
on reasonable notice (which was never less
than 12 months).

b) the Subpostmaster contracts are "ordinary" or "commercial" agreements, made business to
business and so the Autoclenz principle shouldn't apply

c) the Claimants haven't stated any new express terms on termination;

d) there

e) it is difficult to see how the Claimants can argue on the one hand that the termination
provisions do not represent the "true agreement", but the rest of the contract does.

Impact

is no conduct to suggest that the "true agreement" is what the Claimants allege;

Assistants

Did SPMC section 15, clause 7.1; NTC, Part
2, clauses 2.3 and 2.5 and/or any of the
implied terms contended for by the parties
and found by the Court purport to confer a
benefit on Assistants for the purposes of
section 1 of the Contracts (Rights of Third
Parties) Act, and if so which of these terms
did so?

What was the responsibility of
Subpostmasters under the SPMC and the
NTC for the training of their Assistants?

Summary: There is some risk that assistants had directly enforceable rights against Post Office
in relation to training.

Post Office accepts that it was required to provide Subpostmaster with training materials which

allowed

Subpostmasters. It denies that it had any duty to train assistants or that assistants could directly

enforce

Counsel's view is that Post Office is unlikely to be required to train assistants and that this duty
rests with the Subpostmaster.

Impact:

them to train their assistants, but its insists that assistants are trained by

such rights against Post Office.

Significant additional costs would need to be incurred to train all assistants in the
network.

NOTE: Three issues (Compensation for loss of office x 2; Subsequent appointments) have been removed as from the latest Individual particulars of Claim
these issues no longer arise
