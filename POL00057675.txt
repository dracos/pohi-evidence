Subject: POLTD/1011/0186 - CASE NO 24676 - Prosecution of Ishaq

Good afternoon Steve,

lam in the process of putting together a disclosure bundle for the case of Khayyam Ishaq and just
wondered if there are any further statements to be incorporated. At the present time I have a copy of
only one witness statement, that of Umair Liaquat which was in the green file when I advised on the
case.

Please could you also let me have a schedule of investigation costs to date and let me know whether
the audit shortfall of £21,168.64 has been repaid or whether any arrangements have been reached
with regard to repayment.

Many thanks,

Martin.
