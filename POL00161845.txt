Subject: JFSA - two more press pieces

Hi Simon, two more pieces on web. Can you take a look at the Convenience store piece please as they are claiming
“an official statement” that we don’t recognise and is not entirely helpful. It looks like it may be from a letter, the
language is certainly not what the press office would use. We have a call in to them too. Thanks
