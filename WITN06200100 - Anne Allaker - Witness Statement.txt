                                                                     Dated: 30/01/2023




                                   POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY




                   FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF (ELIZABETH) ANNE ALLAKER


              Elizabeth) Anne Allaker will say as follows:


              1. This statement responds to a request for a written statement made to myself
                  under the Inquiry Rules 2006-Request number 1 regarding matters falling
                  within Phase 3 of the Inquiry (Operation: training, assistance, resolution of
                  disputes, knowledge and rectification of errors in the system) of the Inquiry.

              2. This statement relates to events which occurred prior to       retirement from
                                                                                            my




                  Post Office Ltd. in 2017 and is therefore drafted by myself, in my own words,
             .. , from memory and with the help of the documents provided by the Inquiry.

              3. Other than the documents provided to                 by the Inquiry, I have no other
                  documents available to me to submit.

            General

              4. I worked as a post woman between 1979 and 1981 before passing
                                                                                                             an




                 entrance test to train to work as a counter clerk for Post Office Counters Ltd in
                  1981. On successful completion of the training I then worked within the Crown
                  network as a counter clerk until approximately 1985. I then worked in an
                  administration role for Royal Mail Sales until 1988. I then resigned following
                  the birth of my second child and spent approximately 2-3 years bringing up
t '.              my children and looking after elderlyfamily members.`I returned to work as a
                  casual counter clerk, in the Crown network, in the summer of 1991 but was
                  offered a part-time permanent contract within weeks. I continued in this role
                 until approximately 1998 when I took on a temporary role of auditor to cover
  ..,   =        maternity leave. This role lasted approximately a year and I returned to the
                  counter clerk role until I again took a temporary administration support role,
                                                      on




                 in approximately 2001, within Darlington Area Office. This administration role
                  supported the Urban and Rural Sub-postmaster network. I briefly returned to a
                 counter clerk role 6 months later until the administration support role,became
                 a permanent role. I continued working various administration roles within
                                                                in




                 the Area Office until there was a re-organisation in 2006.             this re-
                                                                                                 Following




                 organisation, which saw administration roles being centralised in a smaller
                 number of locations nationally, I continued working in a Network role which
                 involved, amongst other things, managing the Branch                Team, which
                                                                                  Support




                 was based in Maidstone, administration for the National Multiples Team,
                 working with colleagues in the Network Business Support Center (NBSC) and
                 the Service Management Team both then based primarily in Deame Valley. In
                 2012 I successfully applied for a role Contract Advisor, which involved
                                                           as




                 dealing with appointments of Sub-postmasters and any contractual issues that
                 arose. After approximately a year in this role I was asked to work on the
                 Branch Support Programme which I did until taking early retirement in April
                                                                                            WITNO6200100
                                                                                          WITNO6200100




   6. 1 had no formal qualifications for any of the above roles, I would describe any
       qualifications and training as more of an apprenticeship of experience built up
       over years working for Post Office Ltd.

Branch Support Programme

    7. I have been asked to consider POL00039215 and POL00043614. My
       understanding of this programme was for it to outline the current (2014) ways
       of working, specifically all interactions to and from the whole Network of Post
       Office branches, then to look at what it should look like in future with the
       emphasis on getting things done quicker and better for colleagues, customers
       suppliers etc.

    2S. In practice the programme worked with colleagues across the business,
       including sub postmasters, to gather and collate information. Sub-postmasters
       could input to the programme via the Branch User Forum, this was a small
       group of Sub-postmasters who met approximately 6 times a year, with
       individuals from the programme and input their ideas or ideas gathered from
       their peers. Post Office Ltd communication team also a facility for sub
       postmasters and colleagues to input ideas via their Branch Focus
       communication. All Sub-postmasters were able to access support by ringing
       the NBSC

   9. An intervention visit could be for many things, it may be just for general
       support or additional training, whether that was in general or on one particular
       area or piece of equipment. It could be as a result of a
       robbery/burglary/fire/flood etc. It could be to assist with completion of
       Regulatory Compliance tests or to help manage the overnight cash holdings
       in a branch. These are a few examples that spring to mind but I cannot
       remember every reason. In effect if it was appropriate to visit a visit would be
       arranged, however ifs fair to say that a great deal of intervention was also
       effectively managed by phone call.

   10. In my view the Branch Support Programme was effective at raising
      awareness of the impact that contact from internal and external sources had
      on colleagues and customers and gathering requirements for what the future
      of IT would be, although a new system had not been agreed at the time I left.
      It created a platform for sub postmasters through the Branch User Forum. I
      would say that it had begun to be effective but more work would always be
      needed

   11. I have been asked to consider POL00090223. I can't recall the context in
      which the feedback from NBSC employees was gathered in this case and
      whilst I had nothing to do with McKinsey I knew of their report. From memory
      only I think this document would have been gathered together with input from
      NBSC managers and my own and teams knowledge of feedback gathered
      within the programme..

   12. I don't know what if any changes were made by NBSC managers as a direct
      result of this feedback.

My role in relation to Training

     3. I have been asked to consider POL00040066 and POL00034508. In relation
      to the role of Business Improvement Programme and training of
      Subpostmasters as far as I can remember the involvement of the programme
                                                                                               WITNO6200100
                                                                                             WITNO6200100




       would have had would have been to review and provide any relevant
       feedback to their documentation

    14. I can only recall the training offers generally not in specific detail as I wasn't
       part of the training team.

    15. The training offer to sub postmasters wasn't part of any role I had although I
       knew of it and I am aware that the team themselves monitored the
       effectiveness via feedback forms from sub postmasters and ongoing review.

    16. I did not carry out any training on a training programme for the Post Office i1
       any role I had.

    17. I can't recall any specific feedback positive or negative provided to me with
       regard to the Horizon system or training provided. In general I'm sure I
       listened to individuals commenting on both training and the Horizon system
       but nothing sticks out in my memory.

    18. I'm unable to make comment on whether feedback was collected on the
       above as this was not in my remit.

    19. As I didn't work within the training team I cant comment on any changes as
       a result of feedback they received.

   20. As above I am unable to comment as the evolution of training was not in my
       remit.

   21. I have been asked to consider P0L00035473.1 can recall that Citizens
       Advice were interested in the Network Change Programme and had
       requested information but I did not produce the report.

   22. My only role in responding to their request would have been to provide
      details to the author of the report, from the Intervention Log managed by the
      Branch Support Team and the NBSC call logs.

   23. The further reports would have been, as mentioned above, the calls from
       the Intervention Log maintained by the Branch Support Team. From reading
      this document it appears that once I received the report from the team I would
      check to see that the information in it was meaningful as it was, or whether
      the report needed additional information added. Specifically I think I was
      suggesting that the specific model information may need to be added to be
      meaningful to the Citizens Advice team. I would then have passed this
      information onto the report author to include in their report. I cannot recall any
      further information or detail specifically.

   24. As stated above any further information I received would have been passed
      to the report author.

   25. I have been asked to consider POL00033606. From reading the
      document provided to me, the only slide that I can identify being involved in is
      slide 41 where I am referenced as agreeing to a new and improved Follow Up
      Balance (FUB) process. I can only think that I would have been asked to
      review this process by the training team and to provide a view on whether it
      was fit for purpose. I appear to have been satisfied with any improvements
      that they had suggested.

Dalmellington Outreach Branch Transaction Discrepancy

   26. I have been asked questions about Dalmellington Outreach Branch
     and FUJ00085864, FUJ00085842, FUJ00086073- Had it not been for the
     document provided to me I would not have been able to recall any details as
     reported by the Sub postmaster at Dalmellington outreach branch.
                                                                                           WITNO6200100
                                                                                         WITNO6200100




  27. I was not aware of any other issues of this type at Outreach branches or
     other branch types until this issue was raised. This was the only example
     raised to me but, as this document states, there were other branches which
     had been impacted.

  28. Once the issue had been raised to Kendra Dickinson it appears the correct
     steps were taken as the issue was then passed to Finance Service Center
     (FSC) to manage. They would have been able to check the branch accounts
     for this branch and other branches mentioned to see what the previous
     resolutions had been and to check to make sure that the resolution at this
     branch was the correct one, i e. to check where in the Branch Trading Period
     the branch was and establish whether a reversal of transaction, a rem out of
     an amount or a Transaction Correction (TC) was needed. FSC would have
     been the team responsible for raising the TC if that was the correct solution,
     this appears to have been the case with at least 2 of the branches mentioned.
     My concerns with the way this was handled were that ATOS had sent this
     onto NBSC with little or no detail to enable NBSC to either escalate to FSC or
     help the branch. NBSC were unable to check into a branch account or
     understand whether the action they were being asked to take was
     appropriate. It states that NBSC did not have a process for this type of
     instance which seems a fair comment from reading the content and if IT
     suppliers were aware that a fix was needed for this issue they should also
     have been aware that NBSC was not in a position to follow a process. I also
     felt that the early emails did not provide any context relating to what was
     happening with this known issue to allow anyone to provide reassurance or
     timescales for a fix should another case arise before that fix was
     implemented.

  29. I cannot comment in detail or specifically about the relationship between
    NBSC and Fujitsu as I wasn't party to their relationship management. I would
    say that from my own experience getting information in a format that was
    understandable to those of us in a non IT environment was one of the things I
    found difficult.

  30. My understanding of the role of ATOS was that they took on the supplier
     management relationship once the Service Management team had been
     disbanded. ATOS also took on the Horizon System Helpdesk calls.

Horizon Weekly Cal

  31. 1 have been asked questions about the Horizon Weekly Call and consider
     P0L00021130. P0L00043614, P0L00076327, P0100043619.The Horizon
     weekly call was set up to better understand any issues that were being raised
     as a result of the Horizon IT system. It was to try to understand if and where
     any improvements could be made to the way Horizon IT related issues were
     managed and to check whether there was any duplication of issues being
     raised across business areas.

  32. Initially my role was as a note taker but I also chaired the call in the absence
    of other managers. I took responsibility for trying to resolve some action points
    that were raised and to chase up answers from individuals to their own
    actions.

  33. Without the prompt of the documents provided I wouldn't have been able to
    recall any significant issues raised whether Horizon IT related or otherwise.

  34. As I cannot remember the specifics of all the issues raised, I am struggling
    to give a view. I feel the call was effective in that it made sure issues raised
    were being managed or escalated as well as they could be, however from
    looking at the examples in the documents provided it's clear that many of the
    issues related to other branch equipment i.e. Self-Serve Kiosks (SSK), AEI (I
    can't remember what this stands for Application, Enrollment & Identity?),
    ATMs etc, Whilst all transactions would need to go through the Horizon IT kit
    in branch the issues raised were not necessarily as a result of the Horizon kit.
                                                 1~
                                                                                         WITNO6200100
                                                                                       WITNO6200100




   35.It's clear from the documents sent to        that individual Sub postmaster




                                              me
      branch issues were identified on the weekly call. Of the documents sent to me
      I know nothing of POL00021130 and I think it predates the Horizon weekly
      call. Of the other documents supplied I can confirm they would all have been
      raised on the weekly call.

   36. 1 cannot say how aware the rest of the Branch Support Programme were of
      commonality of issues reported by Sub-postmasters or colleagues but
      information on commonality of issues raised was available from calls logged
      to NBSC, the Intervention log and probably from other sources We all used
      the management information available to us to help in our improvement
      suggestions.

Dispute Resolution

   37_ I have been asked questions about the resolution of disputes and to
      consider POL00002396. Firstly with regard to POL00002396, from reading
      through the document provided it appears that NBSC had received a call from
      the branch following a report on television. From my response to the NBSC
      team I can see that I would have checked the branch file on our Electronic
      Filing Cabinet (EFC) and as I had copied in the Contract Advisor asking him
      to pick this up it would have been because I could see that the Contract
      Advisor was already in contact with this sub-postmaster. In this case it
      wouldn't have been necessary for NBSC to get involved as the Contract
      Advisor would have been able to request any necessary reports and/or make
      the necessary contact with the sub-postmaster. I was also both involved with
      and witnessed disputes between Post Office and spmrs either as a note taker
      at spmr interviews, held by Contract Advisors prior to 2006, and/or in my role
      as Contract Advisor between 2012 and 2014.

   38. To the best of my knowledge and memory the disputes I was involved with
      or witnessed were as a result of a shortfall found at audit. These cases would
      be escalated to the relevant Contract Advisor by the auditor to be managed
      through to resolution, Resolution could have been a meeting with the Contract
      Advisor resulting in the termination of a contract, written warning, repayment
      of loss, conditions attached to continuation of that contract as examples. I
      cannot remember the names of any individual cases that I was involved in.

   39. I am aware that reports could be requested from Fujitsu in some cases to
      help resolve issues but from memory this was a documented process via a
      central email box rather than involving individuals.

   40. I don't feel able to give a view on improvements to the process as I don't
      have a full picture of all the cases managed. My involvement was with very
      few cases.

Knowledge of bugs, error and defects

  41. I have been asked about my knowledge of bugs, error and defects in the
      Horizon IT system. I was aware that the Horizon system could freeze if there
      was a communication interruption however there were processes to recover
     any transactions which were in process at the point of freeze. With regard to
     bugs, errors and defects I will say that when I first heard these labels I was
     concerned about their meaning. I heard them used in IT communications, and
     still do in media reports relating to IT platforms, Social Media platforms or
     when a banking system is interrupted as examples. In my time with Post
     Office Ltd it was most commonly used in examples like "any bugs or defects
     will be ironed out during testing", this was often prior to a new product or
     product change going live. Also if something was wrong in the live
     environment e.g. as with the Dalmellington Outreach site, that may also be
     labeled as an error or defect, not that I'm saying it was in the case of
     Dalmellington. In my experience these labels meant that something needed to
     be corrected in the product flow in the IT process.

  42. As stated above.menton of bugs, errors, defects usually came as a result of
                                                                                         WITNO6200100
                                                                                       WITNO6200100




    testing prior to product go live or product changing so would be resolved in
    testing processes. I can also remember seeing           relating to Known




                                                      emails
    Errors but this usually, meant that everyone was aware that something needed
    to be corrected inthe IT transaction flow for example.In these cases,
    communications were usuallysent out to make sure branches were aware of
    any workaround needed until fix was place. In most cases that I was




                                              in
                                   a
    aware of the issue would have been well documented and/or.communicated
    to our Network colleagues.

 43. How I dealt with sub postmasters or Post Office Managers/Assistants would
    not have been any different for having this knowledge. If anyone in Network
    raised any issue with me, I like to think that I would have listened to their
    concerns regardless of the issue. I would therefore         done all I could.and
