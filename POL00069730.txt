1. Introduction
We have been asked to provide details of Cash Declarations at Marine Drive Post
Office between 12" March and 2" April 2004 inclusive.

This note explains the process followed and describes the way the information is
presented in a separate spreadsheet.

2. Process Followed

All messages from Marine Drive (FAD 213337) for the required period were
extracted from the Audit archive by the Security team in the normal way and the raw
transaction data put onto a CD.

I then loaded the data into Excel and noted there were 59,852 items in the log file for
that period.

I then selected all items associated with Declarations (where there was an attribute of
“<DrawerltemDeclarationId:>” present in the log) together with the Overnight Cash
on hand summaries (Objects whose Collection name started with “ONCH).

From these I then manually removed those items associated with Stock declarations.
This resulted in 593 entries remaining which are presented in the spreadsheet.

3. Background information on Declarations

In 2004 there were two separate types of Cash Declaration:

= ONCH (Overnight Cash on Hand)

= Cash Declaration

In both cases the Cash is declared by denomination and the total value recorded.

ONCH declarations should be done each day and the Cash Declarations should be
done before Balancing the Branch.

In addition information from the ONVCH declarations is picked up and passed to the
Central Cash Planning system in SAP ADS and the details of what was passed have
been extracted.

4. Spreadsheet Information

There are two sheets in the spreadsheet:
= Cash Declarations
= SAP ADS feed
