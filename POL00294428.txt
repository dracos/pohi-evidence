ROYAL MAIL GROUP (POST OFFICE LTD) — CASE REVIEW

R. v Timothy St John Brentnall

Haverfordwest Magistrates Court and Swansea Crown Court

Offence and Case history

1. On 10% June 2010 at Swansea Crown Court, the defendant pleaded guilty to
one count of Fraud, contrary to section I of the Fraud Act 2006. On 29" June
2010 the defendant was sentenced to 20 weeks imprisonment suspended for 18

months with a 200 hour unpaid work requirement.

2. The defendant first appeared at Haverfordwest Magistrates Court on the 15"
March 2010. The case was adjourned to 10% May 2010 for committal on which
date it was committed to Swansea Crown Court. The PCMH was listed on the
10" June 2011 on which date the defendant pleaded guilty with no basis being

submitted. On 29" June 2010 the defendant was sentenced as above.

Prosecution case

3. The defendant, Timothy Brentnall, was during the relevant period, 8/10/2005 —
5/11/2009, a subpostmaster at Roch Sub Post Office.

4. On 5S" November 2009 an audit took place.
. On the date of the audit the auditor found a total shortage of £17106.45 made

up as follows:

e £16,448.92 (-) identified as a difference in cash figures
© £657.53 (-) identified as a difference in stock figures

It was apparent that at 07.53 that day a cash transfer had been made to the
ATM machine of £15,500.00 for which the cash was not on hand. The interim
postmaster discovered another £500 of cash on hand the following day and the

deficiency was reduced to £16,606.45

Further enquiries revealed that there had been numerous transactional
corrections since 2006 where discrepancies in the accounting of the ATM had
been raised. There appears to be some confusion in the accounting of these
transactional corrections. Some £22,500 was made good on 3“ November
2008.

. Mr Brentnall in his interviews, conducted under the provisions of the Police
and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 and the relevant Codes of Practice, on the 4
December 2009 said that:
— He had been the postmaster for 32 years
— He worked with his Mum and 4 other staff.
— He had a lottery terminal which was part of the post office.
— He had an ATM machine which was filled on demand
— He got himself in a mess over the lottery money going into the shop till.
— He had 4 days on site training and the man who gave it did not know
how to do the lottery or ATM.
— He was doing the ATM monthly “just pulling off the report at the end
of the month seeing how much I’d put in and moving it”
— This happened for 2 years and then he had a transaction correction for
£22,500.

— This came as a shock.

— If the post office was short he would take money out of the shop as “I
knew half of it was lottery money.”

— “At the time I know now I should have shouted as loud as I could but
I'd got myself into this situation. I didn’t say anything to the Post Office
because it was when they were looking at reducing the amount of rural
offices and I didn’t want to appear to have not been able to do it or do
it properly, you know, and I thought that might be a reason that they
might look at closing my office.”

— He didn’t mention it to his parents who were stressed after his sister
had had a late miscarriage.

— He had been putting withdrawals through twice on occasion which led
in one instance to a surplus of almost £6,000.00

— He did not withdraw the surpluses as they were mixed in with the shop
money.

— He did not use POL money to support the shop.

— He began putting HANCO transactions back through the system. These
created further transaction corrections.

— He then began inflating the cash.

— He gave the lottery a separate drawer.

— He bean putting money back into the system.

— His mother thought that the shop was up by about the amount that the

Post Office was down.

Defence case

9. In interview the defendant denies taking POL money but admits entering false

figures into Horizon.

Discussion
10. This case was dealt with by way of a guilty plea at the PCMH hearing. There
was no basis of plea entered. To a certain extent there did not need to be in that
the investigating officer approached the case in a very sensible and humane way

which meant that the case was never prosecuted with the usual subtext that the
POL00294428
POL00294428

defendant had taken the money for his own purposes. Prosecution Counsel
continued with this approach and included in his case summary a section titled
“The Prosecution’s Stance” which specifically states that the Crown did not put
its case on the basis that the defendant was stealing the money which led to the
shortages, had been repaying the shortages before the audit and had repaid the

whole of the shortage before the plea was entered.

11. The case was prosecuted on and sentenced on the basis of the defendant’s
admissions in interview. The learned Judge stated in sentencing, “that he was
not dealing with someone who had stolen from the Post Office rather someone

who had run into difficulty due to sloppy accounting practices”

12. In my view if we had been in possession of the information highlighted in the
Second Sight Interim Report we may well have disclosed it in this case had the
case gone further than it did. In the event this is not a case where retrospective
disclosure is likely to assist the defendant in mounting an appeal against
conviction or sentence as he was prosecuted and sentenced in terms that he did

not steal the money that formed the discrepancy

Conclusion

13. This is a case in which, had we been possessed of the material at the relevant
time, we might have disclosed to the defence the matters identified in the
Second Sight Interim report but in view of the sensible way in which this case

was prosecuted it is my view that this case requires no further disclosure.
