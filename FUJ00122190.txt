I have been employed by Fujitsu Services, Post Office Account, formally ICL Pathway Ltd.,
since the 22" September 2003 as Security Manager where I am responsible for audit data
extractions and IT Security. I have working knowledge of the computer system known as
Horizon, which is a computerised accounting system used by Post Office Ltd. I am authorised
by Fujitsu Services to undertake extractions of audit data held on the Horizon system and to
obtain information regarding system transaction information processed on the Horizon system.

I have been asked to provide details and information on the reports that monitor faults, polling
failures, equipment failures and calls for advice and guidance logged by the Horizon System
Helpdesk recorded during the period January 2001 to September 2003 for the Lordship Lane
Post Office — FAD Code 162004

I have reviewed the helpdesk calls pertaining to this office and during the period 17" January
2001 to the 30'" September 2003 there were 28 calls from Lordship Lane Post Office - FAD
Code 162004 to the Helpdesk. I am of the opinion that none of these calls relate to faults which
would have had an effect on the integrity of the information held on the system. A breakdown

of the calls is given below:

1. Installation Calls = 4

2. Postmaster requesting help and advice on using Horizon System functions = 12.
3. Hardware problems = 5

4. Non Polling Issues = 4

Continuation of statement of Brian Pinder

5. Software Problem = 1
6. OBC requests = 1.
7. OSP Requests = 1

Details of the calls and an overview of the calls are given in date order below:

At various times on the 22"¢ July hardcopy printouts of the 28 calls detailing the information
recorded on the helpdesk database for the required date period were produced. I now produce
the hardcopy printouts as Exhibit WLM/15.

Any records to which I refer in my statement form part of the records relating to the business of
Fujitsu Services. These were compiled during the ordinary course of business from information
supplied by persons who have or may reasonably be supposed to have personal knowledge of
the matter dealt with in the information supplied, but are unlikely to have any recollection of the
information or cannot be traced. As part of my normal duties, I have access to these records.
