Dear Henry,
Re: Historical Matters Letter

Shortly before his departure, Tim Parker wrote to me with an overview of the work that POL
has done to change its systems, policies, processes and culture so that they are fit for
purpose. The outgoing Chair's letter is attached for your reference.

As shareholder, BEIS has a strong interest to understand how POL is progressing in
making these changes and how it intends to address the Inquiry on the subject of whether
POL’s systems and processes are fit for purpose. Part of POL’s work in this area involves
demonstrating compliance with the Common Issues Judgement (ClJ) and the Horizon
Issues Judgement (HIJ).

I understand that progress has been slower than hoped. POL’s management is preparing a
paper for the January Board meeting so it seems sensible for me not to respond to Tim
Parker's letter until after the Board meeting when I would ask for an update.

Having said that, we are due to meet in early January, and I suggest we touch on this topic
briefly when we meet given its importance to both of our organisations.

Yours sincerely,

Sarah Munby
