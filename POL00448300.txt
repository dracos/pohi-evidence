Thank you Henry,

Yes, this is fair reflection of our discussion - the point on ATM discrepancies and fake notes being clawed back should
also include the claw back on rejected foreign currency as a result of out of dated documentation - all of these matters
(and others) were highlighted as detriment matters over 2 years ago - but no one has gone back to PMs to say - "we got
this wrong, we owe you X..."

One final thing to add: 'Pathclearing' risks looking like a witch hunt - if we start going into branches saying "you've got
losses to make good" this will have echoes of the past - we have to seriously consider how this is being approached -
falls to Roberts’ team again - a man who comes to Board and only tells us about extreme cases of theft by 1 or 2 which
constantly reinforces the mantra of "all PMs are on the take"... Roberts had two jobs to deliver - exit the DMBs and
improve the PM experience - both have failed and yet he and his team get bonuses...a nice gig if you can get it! And that
in a nutshell, is precisely the issue that PMs see and feel..

Since we spoke I see the VoC have issued a press release - it backs-up everything Saf and I said when we spoke to you.
Whilst they have gone further than we did in terms of the CEO - which I would not support - I find their points well made,
well presented and hard to argue.. I think we should strongly consider involving them in our next steps and perhaps
provide some of the oversight elements - they hold more influence and more respect with PMs than the NFSP for sure! If
we have to involved NFSP I understand, but it would say a lot if we engaged with VoC too.

Dear Both ,

Thank you for your time today .

I have done a file note of our conversation . Is this a fair reflection of your views. How do you feel about me sending it to
NEDs before the next meeting ? The English does not need to be perfect . The key points are important . Are there any
points I have missed ?

Seeing the issues in writing makes it more difficult to avoid !

henry.staunton} GRO ;

Note of conversation with Saf and Elliot on Sunday 10 January

Saf said the views expressed by Richard Taylor , and previously by management and even members of the Board , still
persisted - that those PMs who had not come forward to be exonerated were "guilty as charged " . It is a view deep in the
culture of the organisation ( inc at Board level ) including that Post Masters are not to be trusted . SOMETHING NEEDS
TO BE DONE .

Martin Roberts and certain members of his team were singled out . There has been no feedback on the investigation into
Roberts ( inc for inappropriate behaviour and lack of integrity ). He was responsible for the postage stamps debacle
where changes were made to accounts by his team just like Fujitsu . If Elliot had not been on ARC the controls would not
have been strengthened . Roberts and his team do not want any extension to their terms of office as they believe new
PMs would not have the experience to challenge them .

Equally Saf and Elliot are FED UP WITH THE AMOUNT OF POWER WIELDED BY FOAT . He and other members of
the senior team act as if PMs ARE GUILTY UNTIL PROVED INNOCENT ("as per my experience " they both said ) ."
No one believes us " is a constant refrain from PMs . . WHILST FOAT IS AT THE HELM NOTHING WILL CHANGE .
We must also part company with all those investigators who behaved so terribly with PMs. What on earth is happening if
Steve Bradshaw is still with us - his performance at the Inquiry was a disgrace and reflected terribly on Post Office . Foat
uses his leadership of the Inquiry team as an instrument of his power - it all has to stop . The PM " is not the enemy .""
Only PMs can solve this" and tell us how to change . JB is an ex police man . His behaviour has been unacceptable and
he needs to move on to prove we have changed .

The payment to one of PM of £16 as compensation said it all .

There are some 48 people involved in Investigations . There are over 40 just like Bradshaw . These people need to go .
Project Phoenix was allowed by Foat to go into the long grass . Bradshaw went into one of Saf's stores some years ago
and immediately said " we are closing you down " . PMs tell him not much has changed since . There is a complete lack
of respect for PMs and that has to change .

As a Board we need to send a signal to the Executive providing guidance and improving the culture significantly. The
current culture was described as " toxic " ( references to our reaction to fake notes , ATM differences etc etc ). We
discussed a suggestion that we set up a BOARD Committee on Culture with both PMs on it with one or two others . It
would need to have teeth . It would be outside Saf and Elliot's NED responsibilities and would require additional rem . It
would have the benefit of making us more PM centric . We need as a Board to be seen to grip the situation .

Both thought there ought to be PM NED membership on all committees inc RemCo . It may be another PM Director
would be needed - but that may be difficult . Wrt rem it was noted that the December bonuses went down badly with PMs
. There were no similar bonuses for PMs . Our generous Sick Leave was highlighted - there are no similar benefits to
PMs . How are we accepting so many people drawing sick leave payments esp in HR .

A lot in this note to consider and take forward with the Board .

PS Saf reminded me that I had omitted to mention the following : ...........

* I have offered the investigations team time to get the tone right and advised them to get more PM's involved but
POL00448300
POL00448300

this seems to have been missed.
* The comms has been poor throughout our tenure within the business.
The GE have overlooked advice given to them by board members on several occasions without clear explanations.
