Hi Pete

Thanks very much for your time today in clarifying the technical documents we can make available. I'm afraid I have a
few more questions to trouble you with though. Is it at all possible to provide answers to these before the end of
Thursday as we are currently finalising our evidence for the upcoming hearing.

Data extraction

We discussed previously that it takes roughly a day to extract a week's data for one branch. Would you agree that to
extract a week of data for 600 branches would take around 600 weeks?

If PO were to ask FJ to design a process to extract data for branches quicker (without invalidating integrity controls)
could this be done, and roughly how much would it cost?

Horizon Online introduction

On what date was Horizon Online released?

Peaks
How many peaks are there in the Peaks System?
Is it possible to export information from Peaks and what format would this be in?

Did I note correctly that many of the Peaks have no impact on branch accounting and can relate to entirely separate
parts of Horizon?

We discussed previously the possibility of giving the Claimants' access to inspect the Peaks System as well as the
KEL. Would you be happy with us offering this?

Kind regards,

Elisa
