         Telecon 05 01 2015 RJW AvDB re Carl Page


ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD: Carl Page.    Can we have a quick
    discussion on this?

RON WARMINGTON:   Yeah?

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD: Are you on loudspeaker, because
    I'm struggling to hear you, Ron.

RON WARMINGTON: Yes. Hang on a second. My handset's
    not working properly. Is that better?

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD:    Yeah, that's better.   Thank you.

RON WARMINGTON: Yes. My concern on that one -- hang on
    a sec -- dog trying to chew something up next to me.

        My concern on this one is that it's -- as you
    know, you know the way we work: we develop
    a hypothesis and then we try and disprove it. My
    early hypothesis on this case, which I think our
    large -- some I have disproved -- is that the
    asserted shortfall of originally £650-odd thousand
    was a product of Post Office essentially trying to
    claim back the profit that it would have made if
    he'd been selling at the full retail rate, and I'm
    pretty sure that's not what we're looking at.

        However, what I --

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD: A follow-up point, that is the
    case because there's an actual loss in this branch.

RON WARMINGTON:   Yes.

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD: It's nothing to do with the
    profit between the -- you know, of the exchange rate
    of the --

RON WARMINGTON:   Have you got a bit of paper in front of
                                                             SSL00001 16
                                                           SSL00001 16




    you that you can write on? Let's use real numbers
    because I've actually -- hang on, I'll get a piece
    of paper as well.

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD: Can I just explain before we go
    any further, can I explain -- or perhaps you
    understand it --

RON WARMINGTON:   Yeah.

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD: When -- Ford money changer -- and
    by the way, the files that you got from his
    solicitor, that's (unclear) and Neil Hudgell --

RON WARMINGTON:   Yeah.

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD: (unclear) so I've been unable to
    find that with me, because it's years ago, is the
    office manual (unclear).

RON WARMINGTON: Well, we've -- that was in one of the
    files he submitted, wasn't it?

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD: Yeah, which was great actually,
    because that just reaffirmed my -- my recollection
    (unclear) it was.

RON WARMINGTON: And I've read that.   Obviously, I'm
    familiar with what that says.

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD: Yeah. So the revaluation figure,
    so regardless of the exchange rate that was used in
    the Ford money changer, revaluation figure takes
    care of that, it balances it out.

RON WARMINGTON:   Yes.

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD: So there's no issue about there
    being a fictitious loss with regards to if you were
    selling at a different exchange rate, because that
    would just be balanced out at revaluation.

RON WARMINGTON: Okay, here's -- here's what I think --
    here's what I am trying to disprove now.
                                                             SSL00001 16
                                                           SSL00001 16




ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD:   Okay, okay.

RON WARMINGTON:What I'm trying to disprove is that --
   is that -- in the example -- one of the examples
   listed, and it's kind of like a real transaction,
   EUR 150,000 are bought for -- Post Office pays
   £101,000. Okay? The actual cost --

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD:   Bought by what, Post Office?

RON WARMINGTON:   Actually bought by First Rate at
   £100,000.

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD:   Right, all finance (unclear) --

RON WARMINGTON: So FRTS buys it for 100K and it sells it
    to Post Office for £101,000. That £1,000 profit is
    what you'd expect the trading house to make, and
    that later is shared, I know, because this is a kind
    of 50/50 joint venture between Bank of Ireland and
    Post Office, that's my understanding, and it's kind
    of --

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD:   We have a joint venture with
    them, yes.

RON WARMINGTON: Yes, in a sense it's irrelevant. For
    the sake of the argument the cost of that currency
    is I'm going to take it £101,000. What then happens
    is that is then held in the branch records and in
    Horizon as though it had cost £95,000, because
    that's the buy rate, it's the retail. It's actually
    better described as a retail buy-back rate. In that
    case, that is a real number that I'm talking about.
    Because it was held at 95,000.

        He -- his story, Page's story, is that he
    thought that was the real cost -- this is more or
    less where he's supposed to be coming from -- he
    thought that was the real cost and that, according
    to the jurati(phonetic), he said -- he could tell
    anything as long as he didn't go below the buy rate.
    Okay?
                                                               SSL0000116
                                                             SSL00001 16




        He sold that, and in the real example I'm
    looking at, he sold that for £95,095, so he sold
    EUR 150,000 for £95,500, thereby, of course, making
    a loss of £5,500 to Post Office. Okay? I've done
    all this in tier counts in my working papers.

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD: (unclear) the relevance of this
    actually, because actually at the time that
    Carl Page had his branch, he wouldn't even have
    known that.

RON WARMINGTON:   Known what?

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD: Wouldn't even have known that --
    what the buy rate -- he wouldn't have known the
    mechanics behind Post Office getting this money from
    First Rate and what that rate --

RON WARMINGTON: No he was told -- no, in a sense he
    doesn't need to know that, and it doesn't matter
    whether he knew it or not. What matters is that it
    is -- is is well described in all of the
    documentation in the manuals that the currency is
    held at a revaluation rate which is based upon the
    retail buy-back rate, which in this case is 95.

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD:   Yeah.

RON WARMINGTON: So it is held in the books as though it
    had cost 95,000. Now, in order to do that,
    Post office has already booked a loss on
    revaluation, because that's described in the witness
    statement that's much quoted. It talks about there
    being an immediate revaluation loss of 6,000,
    because that -- that is specifically the -- I'm
    dealing now with --

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD:  It wouldn't have been shown in
    branch accounts book.

RON WARMINGTON: No, no, it wouldn't.    It would have been
    shown on Post Office's books.
                                                             SSL00001 16
                                                           SSL00001 16




ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD:   Yeah.

RON WARMINGTON: What Post Office does or did was it
    booked a £6,000 loss by marking the currency holding
    of EUR 150,000 to a value of 95,000 in its books,
    and to do that it would have had to take a re-val
    loss of 6,000, in addition to the 1,000 cost that's
    already been paid out. So it's now got currency
    that really cost in the open market 100,000 but it's
    valuing it, it's holding it at 95,000. So what he
    then does is he sells it not at £103,000, which is
    what he was required and meant to do (i.e. that was
    the retail sell rate), in which case he would have
    made for an apparent profit of 8,000 (i.e. 103 minus
    95) but a real profit of 2,000 (i.e. 103 minus 101).

        So I know exactly what the figures are and the
    profit that should have been made if he had sold
    that retail rate would have been 2,000, in addition
    to Post Office then getting 50 per cent or its share
    of the £1,000 that had been made upfront.

       Okay, now what I think -- what I suspect has
   happened is that when he sold a quantity of currency
   for 95,500, I'm trying to prove whether -- and
   I hope this isn't the case -- whether Horizon --
   whether what actually happened was that instead of
   selling -- instead of being seen to sell EUR 150,000
   for £95,500, he was actually seen to be selling
   EUR 137,000 for 103 -- at a rate of 103, because
   then the amount comes out to 95,500.

        If that was the case, then every time he sold at
    a discount, there would appear to be, as in that
    case, a EUR 13,000 balance remaining in the system,
    because the system's saying: you didn't sell all of
    the Euros, you only sold -- you only sold 95,500
    worth of them and the remainder remain unsold.

        Now, set that aside for a minute because that's
    long way forward from where we are. What we do know
    is that Post Office was alerted to this by
    Customs & Excise. It then said: Ooh, hang on
    a minute, let's work this out, and then discovered
                                                                 SSL00001 16
                                                               SSL00001 16




    the £650,000 shortfall. It discovered it in the
    sense that there had to be a write-off in
    Post Office's books of £650,000.

        And my argument is: if there had to be
    a write-off of £650,000, there must have been an
    overcrediting in the profit and loss account up to
    that point of £650,000. How did that arise?

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD:     Okay, we're in complete (unclear)
    on this one.

RON WARMINGTON:    Yeah?

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD: So the £6,500 is a red herring
    because that is (unclear) cheques on hand, and the
    cheques that the quantity (unclear) that was
    taken --

RON WARMINGTON: I know that.  I know all about that.
    But what I also know is that -- is that in the
    evidence that's supplied to the courts, to the three
    trials, there is a description of the amount that
    was actually made by -- by Whitehouse in terms of
    profit over and above what he would have to -- what
    he'd have got if he paid the retail rates of
    £650,000. It is a coincidence that the numbers are
    similar.

        I know exactly about the ruddy great cheques
    that he wrote out, because I've seen them and I've
    looked at them.

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD: Right, so if we look at the case
    in the branch itself on the day of the order, if
    there was actually no foreign currency on hand in
    the branch --

RON WARMINGTON: Correct, yes because he'd given it all
    over to Whitehouse.

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD:     That's the lot of £282,000.

RON WARMINGTON:    Yes.
                                                             SSL0000116
                                                           SSL00001 16




ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD: And what he did is he plea
    bargained it down to £90,000-odd.

RON WARMINGTON:   I know that.I know all that. I know
    the whole case intimately. I've studied it in
    minute detail. What I'm saying is I still think --
    here's what I think. I think that Post Office got
    this wrong right upfront. I think there was no
    theft of 282,000. The plea bargain down to 94 was
    because --

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD: Before you go on, how do you
    arrive at that conclusion then?

RON WARMINGTON: I haven't. I have not concluded yet.
    I'm saying this is my hypothesis at the moment,
    which I'm trying to disprove. The problem I'm
    having is that everything I'm looking at in terms of
    the evidence is proving that my hypothesis is right,
    not that it's wrong. Okay?

       What I'm seeing -- even if you disregard the 650
   and just talk about the 282, I -- it looks as though
   Post Office concluded that there ought to have been
   £282,000 more in sterling or currency in that branch
   than there was, and that's correct.

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD: Because that's what the printout
    from -- from both machines told us.

RON WARMINGTON: Yes. Yes. Well, here's my problem.
    When a bank does foreign currency dealing -- bear in
    mind I'm intimately familiar with that, (a) because
    I used to be a foreign exchange dealer, both in
    business and for my own account, and (b) because
    I worked for many years in banks. Banks have
    multi-currency accounting systems, it's like the
    Ford money changer on steroids. So if you have, in
    a sterling-based bank, loans and -- and -- which are
    assets -- and borrowings in different currencies,
    which virtually all banks have, each of those
    foreign currency assets and liabilities is marked to
    market based on the spot rate at the end of each
                                                             SSL00001 16
                                                           SSL00001 16




    day, and the balance at the variation is processed
    into a foreign exchange profit and loss account.

        Now, Horizon is not a foreign currency system,
    a multi-currency system; it only has sterling. The
    Ford money changer has multi-currency accounts, but
    the evidence in the documentation shows that the
    totals in the Ford money changer system are cleared
    every time a command 10, I think -- or every time
    a weekly report is produced. Therefore, I strongly
    suspect that Post -- that Horizon was maintaining
    a local currency equivalent of the foreign currency
    balances meant to be held and, by reason of doing
    that, it had basically come to the conclusion that
    there was more currency left in that branch than
    there really was. Why? Because he'd handed it all
    over to Whitehouse.

        Whitehouse -- I've seen what -- Whitehouse's
    bank account. It's all in that stuff. You can see
    he was running a balance in his current account of
    best part of £400,000 at one point, and huge cheques
    were coming in -- or drafts were coming in from
    Tommy Cooks, where he was basically arbitraging, as
    we'd refer to it, between two financial
    institutions: buying his Euros in the Post Office
    and flogging them back to Tommy Cooks, and making
    more than he could possibly make in his recycled
    plastics company.

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD:   Yes.

RON WARMINGTON: Now, he was -- you know, police and the
    subsequent -- the first trial for conspiracy to
    defraud found no evidence of conspiracy between the
    two parties. It looks, on the face of it, that this
    ex-professional footballer, Page, was a complete and
    utter dope and had -- was getting no particular
    benefit out of this. He was just handing it over --

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD: He was getting benefit out of it.
    He was getting the -- so we pay him a remuneration
    based on the value of the sales.
                                                                SSL00001 16
                                                              SSL00001 16




RON WARMINGTON: No, you don't. You pay him £1.16 per
    transaction regardless of size. That's in the
    evidence.

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD: But he would have been increasing
    his remuneration as a result of selling more.

RON WARMINGTON: Bugger all. He gets £1.16 -- it was
    shown as £1.12 and later corrected to £1.16 -- per
    transaction, regardless of size. I mean, I'm not --

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD:    Why was he going it then?

RON WARMINGTON: I'm coming to that. I cannot see why he
    was moronic enough to be doing this. What I'm
    getting at is, it is entirely possible in my mind
    that he was getting some benefit that hasn't been
    disclosed by the court. However, the key issue is
    that I do not see any evidence in any of the trials
    that any money at all was stolen. Okay? There is
    no evidence that I've seen yet -- I'll still got
    about 1,000 pages to go through -- but I've seen
    nothing in the evidence in the POIR or anything else
    that convinces me there was any money stolen.

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD: Right. So whether it was stolen
    or not there was an actual loss on the day of the
    audit, Ron.

RON WARMINGTON:   Yes.


ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD:    £282,000.

RON WARMINGTON: Well, I'm not sure it was a loss on the
    day of the audit. I think that loss would have been
    accumulating every time he put one of these
    transactions. What I'm trying to get --

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD: If that were the case then, he
    would have been -- so assuming that's -- what you're
    saying is right, he would have been declaring a loss
    on his Horizon System.

RON WARMINGTON:   No.    No, I don't think so.   I think he
                                                                SSL00001 16
                                                              SSL00001 16




    was registering the sales through and Post Office
    was for some reason failing to record the individual
    losses. Take the example we've just looked at, and
    we only need to look at, like, maximum of three.
    One would be enough, just this one transaction would
    be enough to say: let's trace this transaction
    through. EUR 150,000 were bought. Post Office
    paid 101,000 --

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD: No, I think you overcomplicated
    this. You have to go into the actual branch itself,
    because that's where the accounting is done, in the
    branch.

RON WARMINGTON:   All right, okay.


ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD: So every week he is required to
    check the actual face value of each of those
    currencies on hand, (unclear) Ford money machine.

RON WARMINGTON:   Yes, I can see that.

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD: Yes, and then what that does is
    it generates a sterling equivalent that he puts into
    the Horizon System.

RON WARMINGTON:  Yeah, I think that's where it was going
    wrong.   What I cannot see --

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD:    No, but if that were to have gone
    wrong --

RON WARMINGTON:   Yeah.

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD: -- that means that his Horizon
    System would be generating a loss, because the -- so
    at the point at which the bureau de change is
    introduced into the branch there's a baseline
    figure.

RON WARMINGTON:   Yes.

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD: Say he starts off with just
    EUR100, let's just make it simple, starts off with
                                                             SSL00001 16
                                                           SSL00001 16




    EUR 100 face value, whatever happens to the face
    value of that in terms of the exchange rate is
    covered off by the revaluation figure that goes into
    the Horizon System. So the revaluation figure and
    the sales figure, sterling equivalent, balance out.

RON WARMINGTON:   Well, the problem --

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD:   (unclear) would be on a weekly
    basis.

RON WARMINGTON: Here's the problem I've got. If a bank
    was doing this, it would maintain perpetually
    a running balance, with an audit trail of how it was
    derived, of every currency, asset and liability.
    All right? We have every asset and every liability
    in whatever currency recorded.

        So in the example -- which is, frankly, I will
    come back to the example that I've got on my piece
    of paper, because it is the example that's quoted in
    the primary court case, i.e. the third trial. In
    that, the money -- the EUR 150,000 is bought for
    100,000 by FRTS, Post Office pays 101,000 for it, it
    marks it to market to 95, and the evidence -- the
    witness statement says that that means that a £6,000
    loss is booked immediately by Post Office, not by
    the branch. So Post Office has now booked a £6,000
    loss.

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD:   No loss booked against the
    branch.

RON WARMINGTON:   I know that.The branch is then
    supplied with currency that -- that has a holding
    value, is reval'ed at £95,000. Right? When he
    sells it for 95,500, which is exactly what he did
    here, but he did it loads of times, Whitehouse walks
    out with EUR 150,000, which he goes and flogs at
    Tommy Cooks for about £100,000. So he's making
    £4,500 or so every time he does this.

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD:   Yeah.
                                                               SSL0000116
                                                             SSL00001 16




RON WASHINGTON: Now, meantime, Post Office has already
    booked a loss of £6,000 in its books in head office.
    Right?

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD:   Yes.

RON WASHINGTON: Or in Hemel Hempstead or wherever it's
    doing the accounting

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD:   Yeah, yeah, outside the branch.

RON WARMINGTON:   Outside the branch.

        When he sells -- if he had sold that for
    £103,000, you would expect Post Office's accounting
    system to book an £8,000 uplift, i.e. it's booked
    6,000 negative, it now books 8,000 positive, which
    gives it -- brings it back to 2,000 positive net,
    which is the current answer. Okay?

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD:   Mmm.

RON WARRINGTON:   Now, I don't think that was being done
    right, because if --

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD: Ron, regardless of whether that
    was being done correctly or not --

RON WARMINGTON:   You cajn't disregard that.

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD: (unclear) whether or not Post
    Office (unclear) making money on that --

RON WARRINGTON:   No, you --


ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD:   -- it transacted through the
    branch at nil.

RON WASHINGTON:   It doesn't --

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD:   At nil.

RON WASHINGTON:  It doesn't matter. What matters is -- I'm
    trying address why a -- or how a 282 or £600,000 loss
                                                                SSL00001 16
                                                              SSL0000116




    can build up over the course of several years in
    Post Office's books without being noticed.

        In other words, transactionally it must have been
    told -- Post Office must have been told of the sale
    that I'm now talking about. It must have been told
    that, instead of selling EUR 150,000 for £103,000 he
    had sold the bloody lot for a stupid price of 95,500,
    thereby making not a profit the Post Office now expects
    of 8,000 but a profit of only 500. All right?

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD: What you have to bear in mind,
    he's in branch of many --

RON WARMINGTON:   I know that, I know --


ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD: -- the figures at head office
    would have been amalgamated figures.

RON WARMINGTON: Yeah, that's exactly what I think was
    the problem. By amalgamating all the figures to the
    local currency equivalent, across an entire series
    of 1,000 branches that were operating bureau
    dechanges, and across probably 20 or so different
    currencies, I think what happened was those sales
    that he was making did not get noticed.

        In other words, it was not noticed that, having
    a loss of £6,000 on reval and having -- if you like,
    expecting, transactionally, a profit of £8,000, what
    actually came in was a profit of only 500, and,
    therefore, a residual loss of 5,500 was in the books of
    Post Office relating to that transaction.

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD: (unclear) this branch, it
    wouldn't have got passed back to the branch, Ron.

RON WARMINGTON: No. What I'm saying is, if Post Office
    now, and I think you'd probably agree, on that
    transaction finished up, when the dust settled on
    that transaction, with a £5,500 loss, i.e. it had
    marked it down by 6,000 on original purchase --

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD:   Yes.
                                                              SSL00001 16
                                                            SSL00001 16




RON WARMINGTON: -- and it made a seeming profit of 500,
    that gives it £5,500 loss, that was still sitting in
    the books of Post Office in its profit and loss
    account. That loss was sitting there.

        Now, what I'm getting at is that -- I think the
    sum total of all those £5,500 came to in excess of
    £600,000. That's what the evidence shows me.

        Now, if that's the case, then if that loss --
    sorry, if that extra profit that Post Office had
    wrongly been booking to itself had accumulated,
    which it clearly had, and was then discovered when
    Customs & Excise came in, how could that possibly be
    theft by the applicant? It isn't theft, it's an
    accumulation of bad deals that he's booked.

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD: Okay. So what you've just
    described is head office activity which is outside
    the activity of the branch.

RON WARMINGTON:   Yes.

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD:   Anything that passed through the
    branch --

RON WARMINGTON:   Yes.

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD: -- would have been balanced out
    to a revaluation figure put into Horizon, therefore
    that branch balanced.

RON WARMINGTON: But I find the revaluation process to be
    fundamentally unsound in banking terms, all right.

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD:   Why?

RON WARMINGTON: Because -- because -- I've probably used
    the phrase before -- no more netting. It's
    a principle I've employed as a chief financial
    officer throughout my career, and bear in mind I've
    been a chief financial officer of a global fund
    management company, multi-currency, a bloody sight
    bigger that Post Office.
                                                             SSL00001 16
                                                           SSL00001 16




        What I'm saying is, to hold in only one
    currency, sterling, the revaluation results of
    multiple currencies acr oss multiple branches is
    bound to lead to errors of accounting for profit and
    loss, and that's what's happened here. Post Office
    has --

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD: No, I think you're missing the
    point around the branch. The branch is still
    £282,000 short.

RON WARMINGTON:   I'm not sure that it was.

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD:   But it was.


RON WARMINGTON: Well, if it was, it's arrived out of
    this revaluation process.

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD: No, no, the revaluation has
    nothing -- no, no. So -- so what the person
    balancing the currency does at the time is
    physically counts each of currency notes on hand and
    verifies: I've got EUR 360, and (unclear) currencies
    he's got.

RON WARMINGTON: Right, Angela, that would be fine if --
    and it may be in the evidence pack, I haven't seen
    it yet but it may be there -- if there is a document
    that discloses, and it will be a command 10 or
    a command 3 report from Ford money changer, prepared
    by Page that says: basically I've got £282,000 worth
    of currencies in my branch here, and he hadn't, then
    we'd have to deal with that. All right? But what
    I'm getting at is it is inescapable --

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD: But he would(?) have done that.
    I don't know whether it's in the evidence or not --

RON WARMINGTON:   If it is, I haven't seen it --

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD: (Unclear) a number of printouts
    in the evidence, I haven't gone through every single
    one.
                                                             SSL00001 16
                                                           SSL00001 16




RON WARMINGTON: If it is, it was not mentioned in
    Stacey's witness statement or any of the witness
    statements that came to us prior to this delivery of
    all the stuff from Tom Cleary. So what I'm getting
    at is -- I know you are trying to steer me back to
    the branch's figures. What I find inescapable is
    that Post Office had accumulated an overstatement of
    its profits of what, to the evidence I've seen
    proves, was around £650,000. It happens to be
    coincidental to this nonsense about the cheques that
    Whitehouse had produced for about £300,000, because
    that's the difference between -- that's how you get
    back to the 282,000. But even if you set that
    aside, there is a huge overstatement of Post Office
    profits which are the accumulation of the failure to
    recognise -- sorry to use emotive terms -- the
    failure to recognise the --

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD: That's might be the (unclear),
    but that's not the --

RON WARMINGTON:   It must be.

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD:   It's not.


RON WARMINGTON:   Because if Post Office's central --

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD:   What I think has happened --

RON WARMINGTON: Angela, the books would not balance if
    I'm wrong. I tell you why. When he booked that
    sale, the one I'm talking about of £95,000, I need
    to know what bookkeeping entry took place on Horizon
    to reflect that sale.

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD: Well, that actual entry will not
    be on Horizon as one sale.

RON WARMINGTON:   Exactly, because the answer is --

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD:   It goes through the --

RON WARMINGTON:   -- because it goes through the money
                                                             SSL00001 16
                                                           SSL00001 16




    changer and it's all based on a revaluation total --

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD:   Yes.

RON WARMINGTON: -- which makes a melange or
    a bouillabaisse of all the different currencies.

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD: It's the sterling equivalent of
    all the (unclear) exchange rate from the day, yes.

RON WARMINGTON: I would never have designed you a system
    like that, because you must hold every asset and
    every liability in detail in its own currency and
    mark them to market daily. That's what -- that's
    actually what FAS 23 requires you to do. That's the
    accounting standard on how to account for this
    stuff.

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD: In terms of taking this forward
    then, Ron, as we've done in other cases then I think
    we've got material evidence that -- so we've got
    further information that's material to this case.
    I think we need to take another look at this in
    Post Office.

RON WARMINGTON: I think you do. And at the moment --
    horrific as it is, I will give it to you with both
    barrels -- I think all three trials were materially
    misled by Post Office in the witness statements.
    I think that the -- there was a -- first of all, if
    I look at that I think Stacey or whoever it is, that
    witness statement, it's a complete bloody mess in
    terms of lack of clarity.

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD: Well, before I comment on any of
    that, I'm going to have look at it in depth.

RON WARMINGTON:   Yeah, and I think as a result --

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD: All I would say here is we would
    never willingly mislead anybody.

RON WARMINGTON: No, I know you haven't, but bearing in
    mind that the second trial -- the first one was the
                                                                 SSL00001 16
                                                               SSL00001 16




    conspiracy --

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD:   I   can't believe that three trials
    would --

RON WARMINGTON: Well, I can, because I've looked at the
    experts' reports. There was an expert from KPMG --
    our first expert was Pannell Kerr Forster, and I've
    spoken to them and I've spoken to the expert
    concerned. He didn't get it, okay? He didn't join
    the dots up and he didn't -- he realised there was
    something wrong and he said so. What he didn't do
    was he didn't crack it. Neither -- and in fact the
    second --

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD: How can they be called as an
    expert witness then, if they haven't cracked the
    problem?

RON WARMINGTON: Because, just like everything else,
    there are experts and there are experts.

        Now, the guy from KPMG made a complete bollocks
    of it. He was the one that appeared in the third
    trial, the one where Page was convicted, and
    there -- that was the most -- it was a completely
    useless expert report. I've spoken to the guy that
    wrote the better one and he -- essentially
    concluding that he didn't really understand what had
    happened. He didn't really understand how that loss
    had accumulated.

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD:   Do you know why Page pleaded
    guilty?

RON WARMINGTON: Yes, I know why he did. I know why I'm
    told he did. This is by his legal counsel. What
    happened was he had lied to the first court. When
    he met his girlfriend, that became his wife, he told
    her that he was an army hero. He wasn't. It was
    a lie. She then supported him through the first
    trial, and it was later discovered by Post Office's
    prosecution barrister or team that he'd lied and
    he'd perjured himself. So he was threatened with
                                                               SSL0000116
                                                             SSL00001 16




   a five-year sentence for perjury. The deal that was
   struck was that they wouldn't pursue the perjury
   charge if he pleaded guilty to the reduced figure of
   £94,000 of theft.

        He'd said throughout, "I never did -- I didn't
    understand where the money had gone. I certainly
    didn't steal it but that seemed the best deal
    because otherwise I might have got a lot of time for
    perjury". So the answer at the end of it is that he
    still asserts that, while he was guilty of perjury,
    he wasn't guilty of theft. We have one of the
    better, probably the best, of the professional
    advisers here, with a guy called Tom Cleary of
    a company called Frisbees. He did not represent
    Page on the third trial. For some reason, they had
    a change of defence team. He did defend him on the
    first two trials, the conspiracy one and the
    subsequent theft one which resulted in a hung jury.

        My problem is that, had this matter about the
    individual losses been clarified in the witness
    statements, I'm -- you know, of course I can't tell,
    I wasn't in the jury room, but I would be very
    surprised if there had been a hung jury and,
    therefore, it would have never got to the third
    trial. So --

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD:   Okay.   As I say, I think we need
    to revisit --

RON WARMINGTON: Yeah, and I'll happily share with you
    my -- you know, accountants like myself eventually,
    if they get really bogged down in accounting
    entries, they revert to tier counts -- you know,
    elementary accounting -- and I've done that for: (a)
    what he was doing and what I think the head office
    accounting would have shown; (b) what he should have
    done; and (c) what -- well, I think I've done three
    different versions using three different colours to
    show what I think the accounting entries were. What
    I need to prove is what the actual entries really
    were and it's all in this -- taking this example,
    it's used in the evidence, take the £101,000 of --
                                                                SSL00001 16
                                                              SSL00001 16




ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD: I've done that bit, Ron. I'm
    just not sure that it's actually relevant --

RON WARMINGTON:   Well, here's what --

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD: -- but -- but -- but you have the
    advantage of you studied the --

RON WARMINGTON: I've studied it until I'm blue in the
    face, frankly.

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD:    Therefore, I need to do the same.

RON WARMINGTON:   Yeah, we --

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD: So I think in light of this
    conversation, I need to -- I've had -- you know,
    I've had the information off you.

RON WARMINGTON:   Yeah.

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD: If you've got any more, then
    I obviously need that as well.

RON WARMINGTON: All I've got beyond that is -- I mean,
    I've got my draft -- the draft report I'm not
    prepared to release yet, but it would be by miles
    the worst report you've read in terms of --

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD:    Well, I think --

RON WARMINGTON:   -- damaging.

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD: -- the important point in all of
    this is we get to what's happened here and that's
    what we need to unravel. So I believe that on the
    evidence that we had originally, we've come to the
    conclusion I think that's the right conclusion. If
    there's further information that's become available


RON WARMINGTON:   Which there has, yeah.
                                                             SSL00001 16
                                                           SSL00001 16




ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD: -- I need to be able to look at
    that to see whether I need to revisit what we said
    in our POIR. So I think in terms of process, I'll
    drop you a note that's formally requesting any
    further information you've got --

RON WARMINGTON:   Yeah.

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD: -- and that I will now reopen the
    investigation into this case.

RON WARMINGTON: Good, because I've got it down for
    delivery of the draft report on 19th of this month.
    I put it back long way.

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD:    -- (unclear) to do it by then,
    Ron --

RON WARMINGTON: No, no. Frankly, I don't think this is
    an urgent case but it's really important.

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD: I think, you know, given what
    you've said to me and the information, I'm probably
    saying four weeks probably --

RON WARMINGTON:   Yeah.

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD: -- to do a proper job and if
    I need -- if I need to go in deep, dive in deep, as
    I might need to do, it might be six weeks.

RON WARMINGTON: Yeah, but whoever it is that looks into
    it, get them to -- you know, I mean, this is
    something that I don't want to --

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD:    I don't want to arbitrate --


RON WARMINGTON: I don't want to blow my own trumpet but
    there aren't many forensic investigators that were
    also foreign exchange dealers and understand -- you
    know, remember, I worked for 27 years for the
    biggest foreign exchange dealing bank in the world.
    So I know foreign exchange dealing like the back of
    my head.
                                                                  SSL0000116
                                                                SSL00001 16




ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD: Yes. Leave it with me.        I'll let
    you know today on that basis before --

RON WARMINGTON:   Okay.

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD: -- we suspend(?) any further
    activity from you on this --

RON WARMINGTON:   Super.

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD:     -- before we've really --

RON WARMINGTON: Well, I'm going to continue to sort of
    peruse the -- I'm, you know --

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD:     Yes.   Yes, I mean formal response


RON WARMINGTON: Believe me, when we formulate
    hypotheses, like we have on this one, we desperately
    try to prove ourselves wrong, and what I'm trying to
    -- it's just that I can't -- I'm trying to work out
    whether it is possible that by selling for
    95-and-a-half thousand quid, EUR 150,000, somehow
    the system, Ford or whatever, somehow got its
    knickers in a twist and assumed that he'd sold
    137,000, not 150,000, thereby generating an apparent
    shortfall.

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD: The Ford money changer's brain
    wasn't that big actually. It's a very simple piece
    of equipment.

RON WARMINGTON:   Yeah --

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD:     It did what the --

RON WARMINGTON:   -- I kind of reverse engineered the --
    I do see exactly how it works.

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD:     Yes.

RON WARMINGTON:   But this business of -- you know,
                                                               SSL00001 16
                                                             SSL00001 16




    I mean, make no mistake, this guy -- this guy really
    was an agent of his own downfall because he wasn't
    putting in the rates properly, he was selling the
    stuff -- it's hard to believe, and I've spoken to
    Frisbee in these terms, you would have to be pretty
    profoundly stupid to be selling currency at £95,000
    when you could yourself walk down the round and see
    other people selling it for 103,000.

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD: He's gone for a lot of effort for
    very little gain supposedly.

RON WARMINGTON:   Yes.


ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD:   That I find very remarkable.

RON WARMINGTON: Absolutely. But the guy that made all
    the -- you know, who knows why he did it. Maybe --
    it's facile to think that he would have shared the
    fact that he didn't have bucket-loads of money
    coming into his bank account means that he wasn't
    involved. For all I know, Whitehouse could have
    been -- it wasn't so much collusion brought about by
    mutual financial gain, it could well have been
    threatening him in some way. He could have had some
    hold over him to make him do this. Who knows? But
    at the moment it's bloody obvious Whitehouse walked
    away with what looks like 600,000 quid, much more
    than he was ever making out of his RPX recycled
    plastics business, and has got away with murder.

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD:   Yeah.

RON WARMINGTON: And, far from being stolen by Page, the
    money was actually handed over to this guy,
    Whitehouse, who at one point finishes up with huge
    amounts of sterling in a carrier bag or a sports bag
    when arrested outside Tommy Cooks.

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD:   Okay.   Let's proceed as I've --

RON WARMINGTON:   Marvellous.

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD:   -- and I'll drop you a note, Ron,
                                                               SSL0000116

    okay?

RON WARMINGTON:   Okay.

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD:    And we'll get on to the case,
    yeah?

RON WARMINGTON:   Thank you very --

ANGELA VAN DEN BOGERD:    Okay.   I look forward to seeing
    you Friday?

RON WARMINGTON: Yes. Friday? Oh, next Friday, yeah,
