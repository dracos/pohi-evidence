1 am employed by Post Office Ltd as an Auditor and have held this position since
September 2003. My duties involved the verification of stock, cash and vouchers by

performance of audit at all Post Office Outlets.

On Monday 14" January 2008, I attended West Byfleet Post Office, 14 Station
Approach, West Byfleet, KT14 6NG, Branch Code (126023) to carry out an audit
together with my two colleagues, Sue Le May and Chris Stevens. I arrived at the Post
Office at about 08.30 hours and I introduced myself and my colleagues to a member of
staff namely, Mr Ali Raza when he arrived at the Post Office at 08.40 hours. Mr Raza
allowed my colleagues and me into the Post Office secure area and an audit of the Post
Office commenced. Soon afterwards Mr Davinder Misra, husband of the
subpostmistress, Mrs Seema Misra arrived and said that his wife was visiting relatives

GRO I around £89,000 from the Post Office. Mrs Misra

Office Ltd about this and had been falsely adjusting her balances to show a clear trading
position at the end of each period. .

I then telephoned Paul Dawkins of the Post Office Investigation Team and Tony Hills,
Network Compliance Audit Manager to inform them of what Mrs Misra had told me.

West Byfleet Post Office uses six stock units and three of them were still in the previous
balance period. I asked Seema to balance the three stocks so that they could be put
into the current trading period which was 10 and to then complete a final balance.
Seema signed the Final Branch Trading Account for the period 42™ December 2007 to
the 14” January 2008 and I now exhibit it as KNIO1.

I discovered that in the suspense account of exhibit KN/01 there was an amount of
£30,930.07 being held under the heading “all Currencies Awaiting Collection C Fwd’.
There was an amount of £27,000 held in cash pouches and an amount of £3,930.07
held in currency in pouches. Seema showed me the two grey pouches with rem slips
dated the 9" January 2008 enclosed. Both pouches had been remmed out using
Seema’s log on code of SMI001 but there was no cash. The currency pouch was not to
hand and Seema could not offer an explanation regarding this. I exhibit as KN/02 the
remittance pouch and slips for £13,000 and KN/03 the remittance pouch and slips for

£14,000.

The final audit report revealed the following discrepancies;

Stock AA -£37,395.47
