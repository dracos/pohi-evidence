Witness Statement

(CJ Act 1967, s9; MC Act 1980, ss.5A(3)(a)
and 5B, MC Rules 1981, r 70)

Statement of William Leslie Mitchell

Age if under 18 Over 18 (If over 18 insert ‘over 18')

This statement (consisting of -04— pages each signed by me) is true to the best of my knowledge and
belief and I make it knowing that, if it is tendered in evidence, I shall be liable to prosecution if I have
wilfully stated in it anything which I know to be false or do not believe true.

since the 22 September 2003 as Security Manager where I am responsible for audit data

extractions and IT Security. I have working knowledge of the computer system known as
Horizon, which is a computerised accounting system used by Post Office Ltd. I am authorised
by Fujitsu Services to undertake extractions of audit data held on the Horizon system and to
obtain information regarding system transaction information processed on.the Horizon system.

I have been asked to provide details and information on the reports that monitor faults, polling
failures, equipment failures and calls for advice and guidance logged by the Horizon System
Helpdesk recorded during the period from the 9" May 2001 to 20" March 2002 for the Abbots
Cross SPSO — FAD Code 247704.

I have reviewed the helpdesk calls pertaining to this office and during the period 9" May 2001
to 20" March 2002 there were 11 calls from Abbots Cross Post Office - FAD Code 247704 to
the Helpdesk. None of these calls relate to faults which would have had an effect on the
integrity of the information held on the system. A breakdown of the root.causes is as follows:

1. Postmaster requesting help and advice on using Horizon System functions = 1.
2. Software problems = 2.

3. Hardware problems = 3

4. Printer problems = 1.

5. Non Polling Issues
