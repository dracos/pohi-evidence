Brian,
Thanks for the Week 41 and 43 Cash accounts.

I’ve updated the note to reflect the fact that I've now looked at them (and the Week 42 cash account that I'd
received from Penny). I've also included the fact that we don’t have an audit of the report about the missing
transaction and a few minor wording changes.

Regards

Brian,
Thanks for your email of 4 September.
1. Gareth's analysis states:

"We are awaiting copies of the actual paper cash accounts for weeks 41 and 42 to confirm that
the printed figures match those extracted from the audit data for this analysis."

However, I have sent the cash accounts for week 42 to Penny so Gareth has seen
them. I attach to this email the cash accounts for weeks 41 (and, just in case

Gareth wants it, week 43 as well). Please can Gareth amend his report to reflect that he
has received and seen the reports for weeks 41, 42 and 43. I would then, with Gareth's
permission, like to disclose the amended version of his analysis asap to Castleton's
solicitors. If you can send it to me in a disclosable format with Fujitsu's heading on it,
then that would be great. It sounds from what Gareth is saying that Castleton has got
FUJ00152633
FUJ00152633

his figure for stock carried forward wrong and we need to point this out quickly because
I understand Castleton's accountancy expert is being asked to repeat this exercise and
may therefore repeat Castleton's erroneous assumption.

2. I confirm that Gareth does not now need to check the draft witness statement I sent
to you earlier. We will get the independent IT expert to cover those points instead.

I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.

Kind regards.

Stephen Dilley
Solicitor
