and we would ther to announce it pub
wish Mr Johnson to be ee to see at least in F
papers relating to the Review, and we doubt whether r
or selective access of the kind you suggest would be

I should therefore be grateful if you would now seek the Prime
Minister’s agreement to Alan Johnson’s appointment on this
basis.

I am copying this letter to Peter Schofield (HM Treasury),

Paul Cohen (President of the Council’s Office) and Jan Polley
(Cabinet Office).
