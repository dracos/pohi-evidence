Reconciliation Date The Reconciliation Date is the date attributed to a transaction to allow PO Ltd to reconcile. It will

be set to the first available Settlement Date from the Transaction Elements ((C112], [C12], [C4],
[S], (D]) that make up that transaction. If no Settlement Date is available, the Reconciliation
Date will be set to the processing date that the DRS first recorded any element of the
transaction. If a Settlement Date subsequently becomes available, the first available Settlement
Date will replace the processing date. However, once a transaction has been accounted for on
a reconciliation report, the Reconciliation Date will never change.

Routing Gateway The Routing Gateway as defined Network Banking Message Flows and Interfaces
[NB/IFS/004]
Run Date The DRS logical date listed on a report and shows which calendar day the data is for. It is same

as DRS System Date in all cases except NB103 reports where it is a day (configurable) behind
DRS System Date.

Settlement Date The date on which the Client has settled the transaction (in some instances a default is set by
the Banking Host). The Settlement Date will be allocated by the Client (or failing that the
Banking Host) and included in both authorisations and confirmations. The [C4], [S], and [D]
always contain a Settlement Date. Other messages may contain a Settlement Date.

1. Introduction

1.1 Document Overview

This document describes the operational requirements of the DRS application. The document
also describes the procedures for supporting and tuning the application.

The introduction of ETU and NSI transactions at S50 are considered, for the purposes of this
document, to be a subset of Network Banking transactions. The DRS is not performing any ETU
or NSI specific functionality.

Like other pathway host systems, the DRS application has been designed to fail-over from one
data centre to the fallback data centre without the need for operator intervention. The restart
which requires an operator intervention can be done on the fall-over data centre.

DRS application performs two main functions during a business day:

1. Provide a high throughput Reconciliation Service handling Debit Card, and Network Banking
transactions in large volumes.

2. Provide an Online Database for 91 (configurable) days to support the Reconciliation Reports
and the Online Query and Resolution System.

The database schema and application modules that primarily deal with the first function have
been designed to provide high throughput and make use of parallelism in processing.

The schema objects and modules (batch and online) that facilitate the second function have been
designed to meet the query requirements with quickest response time.

Most DRS jobs that run as a part of the Network Banking and Debit Card TWS Schedules make
use of checkpoints. These checkpoints are created/maintained in the database and offer the
following benefits:

* Minimise the work that needs to be re-done in the event of fail-over from one data centre
to the other.

e Prevent duplicate report files being produced for the report clients (MSU/Audit/TIP
(POLMI)).

e Avoid re-creating transient objects and data in case of a re-start.

The DRS TWS schedule must be run once for each calendar day’. DRS records the Current
Working Day in the database in order to ensure that a process is not run twice or not skipped in
the event of fail-over from one data centre to the other.

' ETS schedule items where distinct from NBS are included in the NBS schedule

Transactions from

I RDDS Branch Database

The C12 transaction parts are input into DRS database by a batch process that runs once per
day on the Branch Database.

DCS C2 transaction parts are output to the MA through Agents using a file interface. AtS75, NBS
C2 transaction parts are copied from the DRS by the TES Host application over a database link.

The C112 transaction parts are input into DRS from TPS over a unique database link from DRS
to TPS database The DRS requires financial C112 transaction parts only, not Balance Enquiry's
or PIN changes. Furthermore a list of Non Polled Offices and TIP (POLMI) receipted Cash
Account Lines are also input into DRS from TPS. It is believed that this data was required
historically simply to transfer the Cash Account Period to DRS. With the replacement of the Cash
Account with the BTS (Branch Trading Statement), this flow I not required. Also, at HNG-X there
will be no non-polled offices and therefore the entire feed from TPS appears to be redundant
(although still necessary as part of the DRS schedule).

NBS C4/D transaction parts are copied from the TES Host application over a database link.
These transactions are written directly into the DRS C4/D daily main and daily main exception
tables.

At S80, the cash account is replaced by the branch trading statement. This will entail removing
the NB103 report and supporting processes. Additionally some NB102 report titles will be
modified. The DRS changes are detailed in the high level design [DES/APP/HLD/0033].

The Account Week and Client Information are input into DRS from RDDS. Again, the data is
copied over a unique database link from DRS to RDDS database.

The DRS produces a number of ASCII Text Reconciliation Reports which are transferred to the
MIS Workstation, POCL TIP (POLMI) and the Audit Server.

The Network Banking and Debit Card transactions stored in DRS database are sent to the Audit
Server in Archive format.

The DRS Workstation accesses the DRS database for MSU On-line Queries.

Within DRS Host the transaction parts C12, C4, D and S are first stored in XML format as
received from the Agents. The C112 transaction parts are copied directly from TPS transaction
table to DRS transaction table. Therefore, C112 transaction parts are not stored in XML format.

Next, the DRS Parse and Load Process parses, validates and loads the data into a set of Daily
Input tables. These tables are transient and are emptied every day. Any transaction parts which
fail the validation are stored in Daily Exceptions tables.

At S60 new functionality required the Receipt Date to be correctly set on DCS C4/D transaction
parts derived from HMS EMIS files. The full requirements are defined in Design Proposal
EF/DES/009 and implemented in schedule DRS_EFT_C4_RCPTD.

Finally, the DRS Match and Merge Process reads the Daily Input and Exceptions tables and
moves the matched and merged data into a permanent storage called DRS Main Store. The data
in DRS Main Store is kept for a configurable number of days currently set to 91 days.

All the Reconciliation Reports and MSU On-line Queries access data from DRS Main Store. The
Reconciliation Reports and MSU On-line Queries also make use of the reference data copied
from TPS and RDDS.

At S90, a new flag is introduced to C12 and C2 message parts to allow the agent payment file
generation process to distinguish Bureau transactions from sale transactions. Additionally, two
new transaction types will be introduced to support Bureau settlement. Further details of the S90
release changes are documented in HLD NB/HLD/026.

2.1 Environment Variables

All the DRS environment variable names and values are present in the “/home/drs/.vars” file.
When a DRS user logs in, all the variables are "exported" so that they become available to the

2.5.3 DRS Workstation Users

DRS Workstation users will be created on demand as per Access Control Policy (RS/POL/003).
The DRS Workstation users include the MSU or SSC users who will be accessing the DRS
database using DRS Workstation Application and one or more DRS Workstation Security
Manager users who will be creating and managing DRS Workstation MSU and SSC users.

2.5.3.1 DRS Workstation Security Manager Setup
The procedure for DRS Workstation Security Manager user setup is as follows:

e MSU/SSC will fill the application form as defined in SVM/SEC/PRO/0006 (Application for
Access to the Live Network) to create a new Unix user account on the Host as per the
following details:

User Name: As per SVM/SEC/PRO/0006

User Description: DRS Workstation Security Manager
User Home Directory: /home/drs

Unix Profile: /home/drs/.profile

User Group: pathway

e Host Administrator/DBA (ISD) will create a Unix user account. Also, they will create an Oracle
account (OPS$<Unix User Name>) in the DRS database. The Oracle account will be
identified "externally". That is, no explicit password will be assigned to the Oracle account.

e Host Administrator/DBA (ISD) will grant SECURITY_MANAGER role to the newly created
Oracle account. The SECURITY_MANAGER role already exists in the DRS database.

For example, the SQL commands to create an Oracle user account for the Unix user "arrism" and
grant the required role are:

(Connect to DRS database as the Oracle user "sys" or a user with DBA privileges)

SQL> create user ops$arrism identified externally
default tablespace USER_TABLESPACE temporary tablespace TEMP;
SQL> grant SECURITY_MANAGER to ops$arrism;

2.5.3.2 DRS Workstation User Account Setup
The procedure for DRS Workstation user account setup is as follows:

e MSU/SSC will fill the application form as defined in SVM/SEC/PRO/0006 (Application for
Access to the Live Network) to create a new Oracle account in the DRS database.

e The DRS Workstation Security Manager will create the DRS Workstation user account by
running a Unix shell script. The script will also create the necessary Oracle synonyms and
grant user the privileges to access the DRS database.

e The Security Manager will confirm to user that account has been created along with
password to use for first logon (the user will automatically be forced to change this).

The steps required by the Security Manager to create a DRS Workstation user are as follows:
e Login to the Host as Security Manager Unix user.

e Execute the following command on the Unix prompt (the shell script is present in the directory
"/app_sw/drs/sh" but the directory has been included in the PATH):

create_drs_workstation_user.sh <Oracle_User_Name> <Oracle_User_Password>

Where the <Oracle_User_Name>
- must start with the letters DRSWKSNWB for Network Banking users and
DRSWKSEFT for Debit Card Project users.
- can be up to 30 characters long and should contain only letters and numbers.
The <Oracle_User_Password>
- must be at least 6 chars long.
- must be a mixture of alphanumeric characters i.e. a mixture of letters and numbers
(must contain at least 1 char in the range a-z,A-Z and 1 char in the range 0-9).
- must not have two consecutive characters the same.
- can not be the same as the username.

The successful execution of the script displays a number of messages on the standard output.
The exit code of the shell script must be 0 (After running the script, check the exit code using the
command echo $7).

2.5.4 DRS Workstation User Account Closure

The procedure for DRS Workstation user account closure is as follows:

e MSU/SSC will fill in the account closure application form as defined in SVM/SEC/PRO/0006.
e {SD will lock the user account using the following commands:

(Login to the Host as Security Manager Unix user)

2.5.5 I DRS Workstation User Account Unlocking

The DRS will lock MSU/SSC Oracle user accounts following 3 unsuccessful logon attempts. In

the event of this

«= Call will be raised with ISD.

e ISD will unlock the account. If the password has been forgotten, it will be reset and the
account status will be set to "password expired"(to force password change on first use). The
procedure for unlocking the account and/or resetting the password follows:

(Login to the Host as Security Manager Unix user)
sqlplus /
SQL> alter user <Oracle_User_Name> account unlock;
SQL> alter user <Oracle_User_Name> identified by <Temporary_Password>;
SQL> alter user <Oracle_User_Name> password expire;

temporary password to use (the user will automatically be forced to change this at the first
logon).

3 TWS Resources

No TWS resources have been explicitly defined in the DRS Network Banking and Debit Card

project schedules.

4 Transaction Volumes and Database Storage
Capacity

This section has been included only for reference and to provide a brief description of the

expected data volume and the method used to estimate the database storage required. The

details of the current and the estimated transaction volumes are available in PA/PER/033. The
details of the sizing analysis for the DRS database are available in DES/APP/HLD/0108.

As described in DES/APP/HLD/0108, the DRS database can handle Phase-2 ‘Design-Limit’

volumes of 4.45 million (combined) Network Banking, Debit Card and Electronic Top-Up

transactions. Further, to handle situations where all the transactions for a day are not harvested

until the following day, i.e., two days of transactions are harvested on a single day, the DRS

tables have been sized to handle up to 8.6 million transactions. Note: At HNG-X, the non-

harvesting of transactions is not possible since the TWS Schedule dependencies will not allow it.

5 Process Failure and Recovery
DRS Host processes can fail due to Oracle, Application or System errors. The various types of
error conditions leading to process failure and the possible recovery actions are common for most
processes and are listed below:
5.1 Automatic re-run by TWS
In some cases, if a process instance fails a recovery job is automatically started by TWS, which
effectively reruns the process instance once.
For example, TWS reruns a failed instance of C12 Parser. The auto rerun of an instance is done
only once. Subsequent failures on the same instance require manual intervention.
5.2 Failures due to Oracle Error
In case of Oracle failures such as ‘Object does not exist’ or ‘Insufficient Oracle privileges’ or
‘Insufficient Rollback segments’ or ‘Unable to access database links’ and others, an Operational
Exception is logged in the DRS Operational Exceptions table along with the SQL statement that
caused the failure.
Please refer to Oracle message manual (or “oerr ORA ###?” from a command prompt) for advice
on the appropriate recovery action for all such failures.
5.3 Failures due to Application and System Error

In case of Application errors such as invalid reference data or reference data does not exist, an
exception to indicate process failure is raised and recorded in the DRS Operational Exceptions
table which would be highlighted IBM Tivoli Monitoring.
In case of System errors such as errors related to the Operating System please refer to the
Operating System manual for advice on the appropriate recovery.
All DRS processes can be restarted after rectifying the cause of failure.
6 Network Banking Schedule Details
The Network Banking TWS Schedule includes network banking specific jobs and the jobs which
are common (like Reference Data Copy) between Network Banking and Debit Card.
For each job in the schedule, a brief description is included along with implementation details, Job
dependencies (if any) and Rerun action in case of a failure.
Implementation includes the Job name as used in the TWS Schedule. Full details of the Jobs
including the command-line parameters being passed can be found in DES/APP/HLD/0091
6.1 Schedule M_DB_SRV#DRS_NWB_SOD
This is the start of the DRS Network Banking schedule. It will start after the database restart on
completion of cold backup at around 8am.
6.1.1 Dependencies
Follows successful completion of the DRS Network Banking schedule for the previous logical
processing day (implemented via a dependency on existence of the
DRS_NWB_BATCH_COMPLETE.FLAG).
Precedes schedules DRS_RDDS_EXTRACT, DRS_NWB_RUN_AGT, DRS_NWB_ANALYZE,
DRS_NWB_MS_DAY, DRS_NWB_C12_PARS, DRS_ETU_C4LD.
6.1.2 Process DRSC350
Process DRSC350 runs at the start of the DRS Network banking day to set the working day for
the schedule, create the Main Store (DRS_RX_NWB_MAIN_STORE) partition for that working
day and re-set various flags.
The DRS working day is controlled by two logical dates that are stored as “DRS SYSTEM DATE”
and “PARTITION RECEIPT DATE” system parameters for the Application Type "NWB" in the
database. These dates normally correspond to the System Date on the Rig with the exception of
a post fail-over catch-up situation where the dates could lag by one or more days.
DRSC350 will also perform partition maintenance on the NBS C2 tables. New partitions are
created and old partitions dropped. The DRS_NRT_INTERFACE_METADATA table is updated to
reflect the partition state of each C2 output table.

Implemented in the M_DB_SRV#DRSC350N job (postfix "N" stands for Network Banking).

6.1.2.2 Job Dependencies

This job is dependent on the TWS resource DRSC350LK. This is necessary so that DRSC350N
and DRSC350E do not run at the same time. This resource has a value of 1 and will hold up the
running of DRSC350N until itis available. DRSC350E has the same dependency.

6.1.2.3 Rerun action

The common process failure scenarios and rerun actions are described in the section Process
Failure and Recovery

Additionally, a migration specific Application error could occur in the form of process failure when
run for the first time on the Rig. The reason for such an error could be missing values for “DRS
SYSTEM DATE” and “PARTITION RECEIPT DATE” system parameters in
DRS_SYSTEM_PARAMETERS table. These parameters are created with NULL values as a part
of DRS database and schema build and must be set by ISD to the value of Unix System Date one
day prior to running the schedule for the first time. The details of how to set these dates in
DRS_SYSTEM_PARAMETERS table are available in the DRS Delivery Handover Note.

The process can be restarted after rectifying the cause of failure.

Note that it is possible due to the unavoidable implicit database commit performed when
adding/dropping table partitions that, in some esoteric failure scenarios, the partition metadata will
be out of sync with the actual partitions. In this situation, re-running the SOD process will
potentially fail.

In this scenario it will be necessary to confirm whether the metadata/partitions are inconsistent by
running a script provided by development.

If the partitions/metadata are inconsistent it will be necessary to manipulate either to remedy the
situation. Given that the remedial activity will be dependent on a number of variables including
whether any data has been written to the new partitions etc, a call should be raised with 4" line
support.

In some situations, typically in test, it is desirable to run DRSC350 more than once in a calendar
day. The default (build) value of the PROCESS_DAY_MULTIPLE_RUNS_YN flag in the
DRS_PROCESSES table for the DRSC350 process is 'N' so would prevent this. Therefore the
PROCESS_DAY_MULTIPLE_RUNS_YN flag should be changed to ‘Y’ to allow this if required.

WARNING - This should only be done in Live at the guidance of development or support.

6.2 Schedule M_DB_SRV#DRS_ETU_C4LD

The schedule runs DRSC305 to load the ETU file containing C4/D messages into the NWB C4SD
input table and then DRSC306 to parse the C4/D messages into the C4/D daily main tables.

6.8.2 Process DRSC303
Multiple instances of the process can be run in parallel. Each instance can process a set number
of Daily Input table partitions.
The process fetches data from the TPS table view over the database link "tps". The data is
extracted from TPS tables TMS_RX_NWB_TRANSACTIONS_n (‘n" is partition number) and
inserted into DRS partitioned table DRS_RX_NWB_C112. The TPS database has one physical
table for each partition whereas DRS database has one partitioned table to store the C112 data.
All transactions are copied where the value of the column FINACIAL_TRANSACTION is set to 1
in the TPS table. If an error occurs during an insert the record is inserted into the C112 daily
exceptions table (DRS_RX_NWB_C112_EXCP) and the appropriate flags are set in the DRS
C112 daily table (DRS_RX_NWB_C112).
6.8.2.1 Implementation
This process has been implemented in M_DB_SRV#DRSC303N_x, where x is the instance

6.9.2 Process DRSC310 [NIGHT]
The ‘NIGHT’ run of the DRSC310 process picks up all the transaction parts for processing which
have Receipt Date less than or equal to the current Partition Receipt Date. The value of current
Partition Receipt Date is derived from DRS System Parameter "PARTITION RECEIPT DATE" for
the Application Type "NWB" [refer to System Parameters for details].
This process reads the transaction parts [C12/C112/C4/S/D] from Daily Input tables
[DRS_RX_NWB_C12, DRS_RX_NWB_C112, DRS_RX_NWB_C4, DRS_RX_NWB_D and
DRS_RX_NWB_S] in the order of their arrival sequence in DRS. No [S] transactions are
expected for Network Banking. The transaction parts are matched on necessary elements and
the State Information is derived and set in chronological order once for the arrival of each
transaction part. The resulting transaction record containing all the available transaction parts and
the State Information is then inserted into DRS_RX_NWB_MAIN_STORE table. The process also
inserts a copy of Main Store record into DRS_RX_NWB_MAIN_STORE_UPDATES table where
the transaction part(s) had the Receipt Date less than the current Partition Receipt Date to
facilitate fast reporting.
Multiple instances of the process can be run in parallel. Each instance can process a set number
of Daily Input table partitions.

The purpose of this module is to merge those DRS Transaction parts [C112, C12, D, C4, S] that
are in exception with the corresponding DRS main exception tables. No [S] transactions are
expected for Network Banking.
Only one instance of the program must be run at any time. Multiple instances could result in
duplicate rows being inserted into the main exception tables.
All the transaction parts that have the value of Receipt Date less than or equal to the current
Partition Receipt Date are processed. The value of current Partition Receipt Date is derived from
DRS System Parameter "PARTITION RECEIPT DATE" for the Application Type "NWB". The
record is validated to check it exists in the Main Store (DRS_RX_NWB_MAIN_STORE) and the
current state of the transaction part in exception is derived or copied from the main store.
After a record has been successfully processed and inserted into the Exceptions Main table, the
PROCESSED_YN flag for the corresponding record in Daily Exceptions table is set to ‘Y’.

6.16.2 Process DRSC361
The purpose of this module is to Archive Control, Data and Report tables to Support and Audit
requirements and Archive/Purge Data and Report tables older than the Retention period for
Archive server. The archive files stored under Archive server are for future references. The old
data is cleared to make space for the new data. Entries from the table
DRS_ARCHIVED_TABLES are used for archive parameters and criteria. The records that go into
this table are also present in the form of a spreadsheet in Appendix F — DRS Archiving Table
Mapping.
This module uses Oracle Export/Import method to archive data as specified in the DRS High
Level Design DES/APP/HLD/0033
Only one instance of the program must be run at any time. Multiple instances at the same time
could result in corrupt export dump files being created.
If the data purge process fails due to the process not being able to get exclusive access to the
table to purge, an exception is raised and it continues to the next table. The next time the purge
process is run it will purge two days worth of data. Some of the tables (like the daily tables) can
only hold around three days worth of data, so three failures in a row will give problems.

Follows successful completion of the DRS Debit Card schedule for the previous logical
processing day (implemented via a dependency on DRS_EFT_BATCH_COMPLETE.FLAG).

Precedes schedules DRS_RDDS_EXTRACT, DRS_EFT_RUN_AGT, DRS_EFT_MS_DAY,
DRS_EFT_C2_S, DRS_EFT_C2_D.

7.1.2 Process DRSC350

Process DRSC3650 runs at the start of the DRS Debit Card day to set the working day for the
schedule, create the Main Store (DRS_RX_EFT_MAIN_STORE) partition for that working day
and re-set various flags.

The DRS working day is controlled by two logical dates that are stored as “DRS SYSTEM DATE”
and “PARTITION RECEIPT DATE” system in the database. There are two sets of logical dates -
one for NWB and EFT each. These dates normally correspond to the System Date on the Rig
with the exception of a post fail-over catch-up situation where the dates could lag by one or more
days.

7.1.2.1 Implementation
Implemented in the M_DB_SRV#DRSC350E job (the postfix "E" stands for Debit Card/EFTPoS).

7.1.2.2 Job Dependencies

This job is dependent on the TWS resource DRSC350LK. This is necessary so that DRSC350N
and DRSC350E do not run at the same time. This resource has a value of 1 and will hold up the
running of DRSC350E until it is available. DRSC350N has the same dependency.

7.1.2.3 Rerun action

The common process failure scenarios and rerun actions are described in the section 5-Process
Failure and Recovery.

Additionally, a migration specific Application error could occur in the form of process failure when
run for the first time on the Rig. The reason for such an error could be missing values for “DRS
SYSTEM DATE” and “PARTITION RECEIPT DATE” system parameters in
DRS_SYSTEM_PARAMETERS table. These parameters are created with NULL values as a part
of DRS database and schema build and must be set by ISD to the value of Unix System Date one
day prior to the running the BI3 schedule for the first time. The details of how to set these dates in
DRS_SYSTEM_PARAMETERS table are available in the DRS Delivery Handover Note.

The process can be restarted after rectifying the cause of failure.

Note that it is possible due to the unavoidable implicit database commit performed when
adding/dropping table partitions that, in some esoteric failure scenarios, the partition metadata will
be out of sync with the actual partitions. In this situation, re-running the SOD process will
potentially fail.

In this scenario it will be necessary to confirm whether the metadata/partitions are inconsistent by
running a script provided by development.

If the partitions/metadata are inconsistent it will be necessary to manipulate either to remedy the
situation. Given that the remedial activity will be dependent on a number of variables including
whether any data has been written to the new partitions etc, a call should be raised with 4" line
support.
In some situations, typically in test, it is desirable to run DRSC350 more than once in a calendar
day. The default (build) value of the PROCESS_DAY_MULTIPLE_RUNS_YN flag in the
DRS_PROCESSES table for the DRSC350 process is ‘N' so would prevent this. Therefore the
PROCESS_DAY_MULTIPLE_RUNS_YN flag should be changed to 'Y' to allow this if required.
WARNING - This should only be done in Live at the guidance of development or support.

The process extracts the contents of C2 Output (DRS_TX_EFT_C2) table into a data file
containing C2 XML messages. The data file is created in the directory defined by the environment
variable EFT_C2_OUTPUT.

The process extracts all C2 XML records from the C2 Output table where the
PROCESS _STATUS is set to "I" (Initial) and writes these records to a data file in order of
Service_Type, Merchant Number, Receipt Date and Sequence number in the ascending order.
After successfully writing a record to the file, the record's PROCESS_STATUS is set to "T"
(Transfer) and the RECORD_STATUS to "N" (None).

If no records are found in C2 Output table for processing, the file is generated with header and
trailer records and the module exits with SUCCESS.

The single instance of the program can be run several times a day although a new Payments file
will be generated by each execution.

This script will reset all records updated as part of the last DRSC307 run to allow the transactions
to be included in a future C2 Bulk File. Note that this script should NOT be run if DRSC308 has
been run. The dependency revisions to the schedule mean that DRSC308 will not run unless the
S bulk process has completed successfully.

WARNING - Indiscriminate use of this script can result in duplicate transactions being passed
to HMS. Under no circumstances run this script unless absolutely sure that it is required. This
script should only be run where the payment run has been abandoned and no payment file has
been sent to HMS.

This schedule runs the loading of the C4/S/D input data files into the DRS C4/S/D XML input
table from Monday to Saturday.

DRS receives Zero-Value-C4 (corresponding to Null Confirmations) and S input data files each
day following Payment File generation. This schedule loads the Zero value C4 file and the S input
file.

DRS also receives a C4/D data file from Monday to Saturday. It is the responsibility of the DCS
Schedule to load the C4D file that is the result of data received in the HMS EMIS File

7.9.1 Dependencies

This process reads [C4/S/D] XML records from input data file passed on the command line and
loads the contents into FTMS_RX_EFT_C4SD table.

The input data-file/s are read from the directory $EFT_NBE_INPUT and are renamed to change
their extension to lowercase once they have been successfully processed.

The file that is loaded is dependent on the filename that is passed to the module on invocation.
This process is invoked twice in the schedule to load the C40 file and the S File.

7.9.2.1 Implementation

Implemented in M_DB_SRV#DRSC305E_C40, M_DB_SRV#DRSC305E_S and
M_DB_SRV#DRSC305E_C4D. Each job is passed the input data file name containing [C4/D] or
[S] parts as the command line parameter.

This job M_DB_SRV#DRSC305E_C4D is actually a part of DCM_EMIS schedule which runs this
job only on working days, i.e., Monday to Friday except bank holidays. But the job dependencies
shown here have been implemented in the same way.

7.12 Schedule M_DB_SRV#DRS_EFT_C4_PARSE
This schedule runs multiple instances of the DRS C4/D parse and load process.
7.12.1 Dependencies
Follows successful completion of the jobs DRS_EFT_C4LD_1.DRSC305E_C40 or
DRS_EFT_C4LD_2.DRSC305E_C40.
The job DRS_EFT_C4LD_1.DRSC305E_C40 runs from Monday to Saturday and
DRS_EFT_C4LD_2.DRSC305E_C40 runs only on Sunday.
Precedes schedule DRS_EFT_C4_RCPTD
7.12.2 Process DRSC302
This process reads [C4/D] XML records from FTMS_RX_EFT_C4SD (C4D-Input), parses and
loads them into the DRS_RX_EFT_{C4ID} and DRS_RX_EFT_{C4ID}_EXCP tables respectively
for Debit Card.
TWS invokes eight instances of DRSC302 at the start of the schedule.
The process polls the C12-Input table at periodic intervals after a pause whose duration in
seconds is taken from the value of “C4SD PAUSE WAIT LIMIT” system parameter.
The process execution is controlled by the value of system parameter “C4SD FILE LOAD
COMPLETE?” for the Application Type “EFT”. The parameter value is set to “N” by process
DRSC306 on successful completion of all C4SD file load jobs and this would result in all eight
instances of DRSC302 to exit after processing the last set of records from the C4/D input table.
7.12.2.1 Implementation
Implemented in the M_DB_SRV#DRSC302E_1...8 jobs (the postfix “E” stands for Debit
Card/EFTPoS).

automatically reruns the failed instance once. If it fails on the rerun, TWS does not attempt any
further automatic reruns for that instance. Any failures would result in operational exceptions
being logged, which can be used for fault analysis/resolution.

The process fetches data from the TPS tables over the database link “tps” and inserts into DRS
table. The data is extracted from TPS tables TMS_RX_EFT_TRANSACTIONS_n (“n” is partition
number) and inserted into DRS partitioned table DRS_RX_EFT_C112. The TPS database has
one physical table for each partition whereas DRS database has one partitioned table to store the
C112 data.
All transactions are copied where the value of the column FINACIAL_TRANSACTION is set to 1
in the TPS table. If an error occurs during an insert the record is inserted into the C112 daily
exceptions table (DRS_RX_EFT_C112_EXCP) and the appropriate flags are set in the DRS
C112 daily table (DRS_RX_EFT C112).
7.14.2.1 Implementation
This process has been implemented in M_DB_SRV#DRSC303E_x, where x is the instance
number ranging from 1 to 9 and the postfix “E” stands for Debit Card/EFTPoS. The 9" instance of
the process is run to deal with any TIP (POLMI) repaired transactions present in the 65" partition.

On the pattern of DRS Main Store processing (DRSC310), only those exceptions are processed
that have the value of Receipt Date less than or equal to the current Partition Receipt Date. The
value of current Partition Receipt Date is derived from DRS System Parameter “PARTITION
RECEIPT DATE” for the Application Type “EFT”. The record is validated to check it exists in the
Main Store (DRS_RX_EFT_MAIN_STORE] table and the current state of the transaction part in
exception is either derived or copied from the Main Store table.
After a record has been successfully processed and inserted into the Exceptions Main table, the
PROCESSED_YN flag for the corresponding record in Daily Exception table is set to ‘Y’.

All DRS tables that are used to store non-transactional data are common to both Network
Banking and Debit Card/EFTPoS applications. These include tables for storing system
parameters, process control, audit and various file register tables.
Most common tables have a column named APPLICATION_TYPE, which can be mandatory or
optional depending on the type of table. Notable exclusions are tables associated with
housekeeping tasks such as partition management and archiving. If the application type is
mandatory, it is a part of the key for the table and its value is derived from the Application-Type
command-line input parameter that is passed to the process. If the application type is non-
mandatory, it will be used only for records that are Application specific. The two
APPLICATION_TYPE values used are ‘EFT’ for Debit Card Transactions and ‘NWB? for Network
Banking Transactions and ETU Transactions.
Refer to Appendix D — DRS Tables for a brief description of all common DRS tables.

FUJ00234959

The DRS tables can be divided into three categories:

8.3.1 Static Data Tables

Static data tables store reference-type information that is used by Host Processes and DRS
Workstation.

All static data tables have a column named APPLICATION_TYPE to show whether the reference
data is to be used for Network Banking (NWB), Debit Card (EFT) or both. This column could be
mandatory or nullable depending upon the type of data stored in a static data table. If the column
is nullable, just one set of values is stored in the table and the APPLICATION_TYPE column is
set only for the records that are specific to an APPLICATION_TYPE. For example,
APPLICATION_TYPE column is nullable in DRS_PROCESSES table, which stores the details of
the DRS processes. APPLICATION_TYPE column in this table is populated only for the
processes specific to Network Banking or Debit Card. For common _ processes,
APPLICATION_TYPE column is not populated in DRS_PROCESSES table.

If the APPLICATION_TYPE column is mandatory and a part of the Unique/Primary Key
constraint, common records in the table are repeated for each application type. For example,
APPLICATION_TYPE column is mandatory in DRS_SYSTEM_PARAMETERS table which stores
details of the System Parameters. This table stores all common System Parameters twice, that is,
once for each application type.

8.3.2. Control/Registry Data Tables

The DRS database has a single set (as opposed to two sets of transaction tables) of tables that
store Control and Registry Information. The control records for both Network Banking and Debit
Card are stored in the same table and are distinguished by the value in APPLICATION_TYPE
column, which forms a part of the Unique/Primary key for the table. Examples of such tables
include DRS_REP_FILE_REGISTER, DRS_C4SD_FILE_REGISTER,
DRS_PROCESS_CONTROL etc.

8.3.3. Transaction Data Tables

The DRS has two sets of transaction data tables one for Network Banking and one for Debit
Card. Each set has a 3-letter acronym in the table name to show which application type the table
belongs to. The Network Banking tables use “NWB"” and the Debit Card tables use the “EFT”
acronym. The tables storing similar transactional data for Networking Banking and Debit Card
reside in the same tablespace. For example, DRS_RX_NWB_MAIN_STORE_UPDATES and
DRS_RX_EFT_MAIN_STORE_UPDATES tables store updates to the old Network Banking
transactions and reside in the tablespace DRS_MAIN_STORE_UPDATES.

The DRS has two sets of Oracle users one for Network Banking and one for Debit Card. These
users access the transaction data tables through a set of private synonyms. From example,
DRS_RX_NWB_MAIN_STORE_UPDATES table is accessed through a private synonym named
DRS_RX_MAIN_STORE_UPDATES for the Oracle users “OPS$DRSNWB”" = and
“OPS$DRSNWB1...8". Similarly, DRS_RX_EFT_MAIN_STORE_UPDATES table is accessed
through a private synonym named DRS_RX_MAIN_STORE_UPDATES for the Oracle users

both the sets of Oracle users.
9 Files Created/Used
9.1 Input and Output Data Files
The input data files contain [C4/D/S] messages in XML format received from the Network Banking
Engine (for Network Banking) or Merchant Acquirer (for Debit Card). The input files containing [S]
messages are received for Debit Card only.
The output data files contain [C2] messages in XML format and are sent to Merchant Acquirer
through DCP C2-Bulk File Agent. The output files containing [C2] messages are created for Debit
Card only.
9.1.1 Network Banking & Electronic Top-Ups
9.1.1.1 C4/D Input
These files contain [C4] and [D] messages in XML format and Control Information received from
the Network Banking Engine. TWS runs a script that delivers these files into a Host directory to
be loaded into the DRS database. For Electronic Top-Ups the daily transaction feed file from e-
pay is converted into [C4] and [D] messages in XML format and placed by TWS into the same
Host directory used for Network Banking. No MAC or control information is required for Electronic
Top-Ups.

9.2 Report Files
9.2.1. Network Banking (Including ETU) and Debit Card
9.2.1.1. MSU Report Files
These files contain NBOOO (for Network Banking only), NB101, NB102 and NB103 Reconciliation
Reports for MSU (Management Support Unit). The files are produced daily (with the exception of
NB103 which is weekly), one for each routing gateway and currency type. Electronic Top-Ups are
reported through the Network Banking reports as a unique routing gateway. Also, a Unix link of
these files is created in the TIP (POLMI) and/or Audit directories, where necessary.
TWS copies these report files from the Host to the MIS Workstation. Audit Server copies the
report files by running its own script. In the future there will be a staging server that the files will
be copied to, then the MSU Workstation can then access these files via this staging server.
The old report files (*.TXT) are deleted after a configurable number of days by DRS File Purge
job (DRSX362.sh).

All the report files are initially created in $NWB_MSU_OUTPUT and $EFT_MSU_OUTPUT.
Then, Unix links are created in the directory $NWB_TIP_OUTPUT and $EFT_TIP_OUTPUT for
the report files that are required by POL TIP (POLMI).
The FTMS transfers these report files to TIP (POLMI) Gateway. For each file successfully
transferred to TIP (POLMI), FTMS creates an acknowledgement file in $NWB_TIP_OUTPUT
directory. The acknowledge files (ACK) are loaded into DRS database by DRSC367 (Load FTMS

9.3 Oracle Export Files for Audit, Archive and
Support

Oracle export files are created for audit, archive and support requirements.

9.3.1 Network Banking and Debit Card

9.3.1.1 Oracle Export Files for Support

These files are created using Oracle “exp” utility. The export dump files contain data from DRS
tables as detailed in Appendix F — DRS Archiving Table Mapping Once the dump files are
successfully created, the files are compressed using Unix utility ‘compress’ to reduce the disk
space usage.

The file names and storage location for Network Banking and Debit Card are as follows:

Directory Name File Name Extension Extension After
Before Compression
Compression

$NWB_SUPPORT_OUTPUT & DRS<ApplicationAlias><Archi I dmp dmp.Z
$EFT_SUPPORT_OUTPUT veGroupAlias><RunDate>

Where,

<ApplicationAlias> Stored in DRS_ARCHIVED_TABLES table,
NWB for Network Banking Application and
EFT for Debit Card.

<ArchiveGroupAlias> Stored in DRS_ARCHIVED_TABLES table,
e.g. OPR (for Operational tables)

<RunDate> Current DRS Processing date in the format ‘YYYYMMDD'.

For example, the name of Oracle dump file for DRS_RX_NWB_MAIN_STORE table will be
DRSNWBDMS20020523.dmp.Z and DRS_RX_EFT_MAIN_STORE table will be
DRSEFTDMS20020523.dmp.Z.

An export parameter containing the parameters required by the Oracle export utility and a log file
containing any errors encountered during the export are also created as per the following details:

respectively. Similarly, the name of Oracle export parameters and logs files for
DRS_RX_EFT_MAIN_STORE table will be DRSEFTDMS.par and DRSEFTDMS20020523.log
respectively.

Old files (DRSNWB*.log and DRSEFT*.log) are deleted after a configurable number of days by
DRS File Purge job (DRSX362.sh). The *.par files do not need housekeeping as the same file is
overwritten each day.

9.3.1.2 Oracle Export Files for Archive

The Oracle export dump files are initially created in the directory /bvnw01/drs/trans/drssupport
(pointed to by $NWB_SUPPORT_OUTPUT and $EFT_SUPPORT_OUTPUT). After the files have
been created and compressed successfully a Unix link is created in the directory
/bvnw01/drs/trans/drsarchive (pointed to by $NWB_ARCHIVE_OUTPUT and
$EFT_ARCHIVE_OUTPUT) for the files required for archive purpose as detailed in Appendix F —
DRS Archiving Table Mapping.

9.3.1.3 Oracle Export Files for Audit
The Oracle export dump files are initially created in the directory /bvnw01/drs/trans/drssupport
(pointed to by $NWB_SUPPORT_OUTPUT and $EFT_SUPPORT_OUTPUT).. After the files
have been created and compressed successfully a Unix link is created in the directory
bvnw01/drs/trans/drsaudit (point to by $NWB_AUDIT_OUTPUT and $EFT_AUDIT_OUTPUT) for
the files required for audit purpose as detailed in Appendix F —- DRS Archiving Table Mapping.
The file names and storage location for export dump files are as follows:

10 Support Usage of Archive/Support Export

Files
DRS Archive/Support files for Network Banking and Debit Card are created in the form of
compressed Oracle Export database dumps. For details on the naming conventions, file locations
and the file contents, refer to the sections 9.3 and Appendix F — DRS Archiving Table Mapping.
The compressed Oracle export file formats have been chosen to facilitate transport of these files
to multiple environments and ease of loading. Additionally, as the data will be sufficiently
compacted, the disk usage and transfer time will less. Note that these files are not meant for
restoring the state of tables in Live. The Live Backup and Restores are discussed in Section 11.
The Archive/Support files can be loaded by Support on a separate DRS Support environment.
This would typically be a machine running the same Host operating system and version of Oracle
as Live. The support rig must have all Host work packages that have been applied to Live. Also,
the size of the DRS database must match that of Live for all tablespaces with the exception of the
Main Store partition tablespaces.
The following steps should be followed to use the Archive/Support files on the Support rig:
e Copy the compressed Archive/Support file/s to the “/loadarea” directory on the Support rig.

Uncompress the file/s

Delete all existing records from the target table/s in order to ensure no Primary Key violations
occur and that there is sufficient space in the target tablespace

If importing the Main Store table (DRS_RX_NWB_MAIN_STORE), drop the table and use
import to create the table with the required partition name

Use the Oracle 8.1.7 Import Utility “imp” to load the contents of the file into target tables. In
addition to the mandatory parameters like USERID and FILE, it is recommended that the
following parameters are used to minimise chances of failure:

BUFFER = 44000000

IGNORE = Y

COMMIT = Y

FROMUSER = OPS$DRS

TOUSER = OPS$DRS

FILE = <Name of the database dump file>
TABLES = <List of tables being imported>

11 Backup and Recovery

11.1 Backup

The DRS backups use the EMC Timefinder product, which allows the EMC array to maintain a 3"¢
mirror of defined disk volumes contained within the disk array. This 3 mirror (known as a BCV)
can be split from the parent volumes at any time. Timefinder also allows the BCV's to be
resynchronised with the parent disks, only copying the tracks that have changed since the BCV
was last connected, therefore minimising the time taken to resynchronise.

The backup strategy follows the traditional database backup scheme of a cold backup supported
by redo logs tracking the changes made since the cold backup. The time taken for the cold
backup will be limited to the time taken to close down and restart the Oracle database instance.

The backup schedule is defined by the application designer following the guidelines specified in
DES/SYM/HLD/0016, but is expected to be along the following lines:

1.

Following the completion of the Network Banking and Debit Card end of day schedules,
resynchronise the BCVs with the parent volumes.

2. Once resynchronised and all other database jobs have completed, shutdown the DRS Oracle
instance.
3. Split the BCVs from the parent volumes.
4. Start the Oracle database instance.
5. Start backing up the data on the BCV's to tape.

FUJ00234959
FUJ00234959

The BCVs will remain split until the completion of next processing day's batch overnight jobs (the
TWS day runs from 8 am in the morning) thus ensuring improved recovery from backup, if it
proves necessary.

The Middleware scripts that control the splitting and resynchronisation of BCV volumes have
been provided by ISD and their integration with the TWS schedule has been done by TWS
development.

11.2 Recovery

11.2.1. Process Failure

In case of failure, the DRS processes rollback changes made to the database wherever possible
before exiting and/or make use of the Process Control to save the last successful restart point.

Dependencies have been defined in the schedule, which disallows TWS from running processes
that are dependent on the failed process this ensuring data integrity. The failed process is then
re-run by the TWS scheduler after a predefined time gap (with manual intervention). In case of
multiple restart points in a process, program logic is used to start from the latest restart point.

11.2.2 System Failure

If the operating system crashes or there is an Oracle Instance failure during the DRS processing
day, it is possible to restart DRS from the point of failure. This is because the DRS database will
be run in ‘Archive-Log' mode.

Once the system is re-started, standard Oracle recovery process would apply all committed
transactions which have not been saved earlier, to the database through the use of redo-log
buffers and rollback segments in a process called “roll forward and back”. For more information
refer to the Oracle Administrators Guide for version 8.1.7.

The TWS scheduler records the process name that was being executed when the crash
occurred. As in the case of Process Failure, the schedule will need to be manually restarted from
the process that has failed.

11.2.3 Media Failure

In case of a media or disk failure, Oracle may not be able to save / read data from the disk. This
could happen due to a number of causes but as the DRS database is running in ‘Archive-log’
mode, it is possible to restart from a point in time prior to the failure in the DRS processing day.
This can be achieved by restoring the previous consistent database backup from the BCV (refer
to Section 11.1) and using the archived and online redo-log files to recover to a point of time just
prior to the media failure.

Successful database recovery from a media failure should be followed by schedule re-start from
the point of failure for the Network Banking/Debit Card and other connected systems.

It is not envisaged that a part of the schedule would need to be rerun as the restore using online
and archived redo-logs is expected to recover the database to its state prior to the failure and the

incomplete DRS processes could be restarted. However if there is a need for schedule rerun,
refer to Section 14.
12 External System Failures/Restarts
This section lists the external systems that interface with DRS and discusses the most common
failure scenarios and how DRS can recover from them. For an exhaustive description of Failure
Scenarios and Recovery, please refer to NB/IFS/004.
12.1 TPS Host/Agent Failure
DRS obtains the [C112] Confirmation Messages, Outlet Last Polled Statuses and the TIP
(POLMI) Cash Account Delivery Statuses from TPS Host. There are two possible failure
scenarios with TPS as described below.
12.1.1 ©4112 Confirmation Agent Failure
A failure on the part of the C112 TMS Agent to load Network Banking/Debit Card [C112]
transactions into TPS-Host results in the TPS schedule being held up. This in turn would result in
the DRS schedule being held up because of the DRS TWS dependency on completion of TPS
Reports (schedule named M_DB_SRV#TPSCAREP).
DRS waits until the C112 TMS Agents have successfully harvested the Network Banking/Debit
Card [C112] transactions into TPS-Host.
12.1.2 TPS Host failure
TPS and DRS share the same the machine. To prevent the resource contention, the TPS TIP
(POLMI) jobs which have to meet an SLA are run before the DRS jobs.
If a TPS Host failure occurs before the start of the DRS schedule, DRS waits for the TPS issue to
be resolved. The DRS Start of Batch Overnight (DRSC353) job is dependent on TPS Cash
Account Reports (schedule M_DB_SRV#TPSCAREP).
There is a TWS dependency from DRS to TPS schedule as well. TPS Housekeeping (TPSC209)
job can not run until the Network Banking and Debit Card transactions have been copied to DRS.
Refer to DEV/APP/SPG/0026 for more details.
If a database error occurs while the DRS C112 Transactions Copy (DRSC303) or the Last Polled
Outle/CA Receipts Copy (DRSC366) processes are running, DRS waits until the issue is
resolved. The DRS Copy Processes are rerun after the database problem has been resolved.
12.2 RDDS Host Database Failure
If a RDDS Host database failure occurs before the execution of the RDDS-to-DRS copy process
(DRSC364), a TWS dependency makes DRS wait for RDDS to be backed up again before
allowing the DRSC364 process to run.

FUJ00234959
FUJ00234959

lf a RDDS Host database failure occurs during the execution of the RDDS-to-DRS copy process
(DRSC364), the process is likely to fail and log one/more Operational Exceptions to record the
error details. Once RDDS database is back up again, the process can be rerun.

12.3 TES Host Database Failure

A TES Host database failure would result in the C4/D transactions not arriving. One or more of
the TES owned TES_AL_REC_RUN/TES_CAPO_REC_RUN/ TES_LINK_REC_RUN schedules
would not complete due to DRSC371 failing which will result in all the DRS batch overnight
schedules being held up.

Once the failure is resolved and the preceding TES processes have completed, the DRS batch
overnight jobs will start execution.

Because of the dependencies within the DRS schedule, there would be a corresponding delay in
the completion of TPS-Host batch overnight.

12.4 FTMS Report-file Transfer Failure

FTMS transfers the Network Banking and Debit Card reconciliation reports to TIP-remote server
and their transfer acknowledgement files back to DRS.

lf a failure occurs in transferring these files to the TIP-remote server due to the failure of FTM
transfer mechanism or the Network, DRS-Host would not receive acknowledgements for the files
that could not be transferred. This would be reflected in the value of TIP_LRECEIPT_DATE in
table DRS_REP_FILE_REGISTER.

All report files created for transfer to the PLG FTMS gateway are retained for 5 working days
(configurable) as listed in 9.4 DRS File Housekeeping Parameters. As long as the failure is
resolved and the report files are transferred with that period, there would be no loss of data.

12.5 TWS File Transfer Failure

TWS scripts transfer the MSU Reports to MSU using NFS mounted host directory
(/bvnw01/drs/trans/drsmsu) on the SSC Server. Another set of scripts transfer the DRS Support
and Archive files to the SSC Archive Server again via NFS mounted Host directories
(/ovnw01/drs/trans/drssupport and /bvnw01/drs/trans/drsarchive).

Failure in transferring files to the MSU/SSC Archive may result in some/all of the files not being
transferred. This should not be an issue for Host processing and would not result in loss of data
as long as the file transfer mechanism is able to successfully transfer the files before the files are
deleted by DRS file housekeeping process.

The files would remain on the DRS-Host for MSU to request for manual transfer in case of
automatic transfer failures. Similarly the Support/Archive files can also be requested for a manual
transfer from the DRS-Host.

From Directories and DES/APP/HLD/0108, space for 5 peak working days at phase-2 volumes
has been requested for the DRS Support and MSU-Report directories.

12.6 Audit Server File Transfer Failure
DRS creates Unix hard links for reconciliation reports and a compressed export of the oldest Main
Store partition in the DRS-Audit (/bvnw01/drs/trans/drsaudit) directory.
Failure in transferring files to the Audit Server may result in some/all of the files not being
transferred to the Audit Server. This should not be an issue for Host processing and would not
result in loss of data as long as the file transfer mechanism is able to successfully transfer the
files before the space allocated to the audit directory is exhausted or before the files are deleted
by Audit file housekeeping. From Directories and DES/APP/HLD/0108, space for 5 peak working
days at phase-2 volumes has been requested for the Audit directory.

Parameter Value Reason

DISTRIBUTED_TRANSACTIONS, 30 Maximum number of Concurrent Distributed
Transactions.

13.2 Schedule tuning

There are two ways to tune the schedule performance:

13.2.1 Schedule parallelism

Several parallel streams will run the load, parse and main store update jobs within the DRS
schedule (e.g. if eight streams are run, each stream will process on eighth of the total number of
partitions). The processes have been scheduled such that write to the same set of tables are not
run at the same time.

The parallelism needs to be tuned on a regular basis to take into account the changing volumes
and spread of data so that each activity can make maximum use of the computer configuration.

13.2.2 Resource pools

TWS has a facility to limit the number of jobs running that requires a particular resource, such as
a tape drive. These resource pools are user defined, and can be used to minimise contention.

DRS does not currently use TWS resource pools as the number of jobs running at any given time
is not considered high enough.

13.3 Main store partition tuning

The DRS Main Store tables for Network Banking and Debit Card have been partitioned on
Receipt Date and sub-partitioned on ‘hash’ of Horizon-Transaction-Id. Each partition (along with
its sub-partitions) has its own tablespace, which is spread across physical disks. This has been
done to improve query efficiency and is particularly beneficial for use in parallel queries.

13.4 SQL hint tuning

The Oracle Database Server supports a number of ‘hints’ to its optimiser which informs the
RDBMS at run time of access paths that have been found (through performance testing) to be the
most efficient path to use.

Bearing in mind that DRS is a new product and that the transaction spread may change over
time, the SQL hints used have been stored in a table named DRS_SQL_HINTS. Host processes
that expect to find SQL hints access this table to fetch and use the SQL hint. This has been
implemented to provide for ease of change.

For processes that access large tables, the hint “Parallel” can be/is used for SQL operations
doing fetches and performing sorts. This makes use of the multiple processors present on Host,

multiple parallel query servers possible due to the virtual memory available on the host and the
striping of the tablespaces’ data files across disks.

14 Re-run

DRS has been designed to automatically recover from a data centre failure. All programs will
restart at the point of failure regardless of whether the TWS schedule was recovered.

Since DRS maintains data for 91 days and the non-transient tables are updated on receipt of
each transaction part, it is not advisable to rerun part of the schedule that has been successfully
processed.

Appendix E — DRS Exceptions

Priority listed against the exceptions in the following table stands for:

A - Business critical error. If ignored, would violate SLA with Post Office. The error should be fixed immediately / workaround be implemented to avoid violating the

SLA deadline.

B - Error condition but of medium priority. May/will cause the DRS schedule to be held up and should be resolved at the earliest on the same/in the next business day

after resolving exceptions of Priority A.
C - Low priority error conditions / warnings / information only messages. These should be looked onto after resolving all exceptions of A and B priorities.

X - Ignore. Exception is no longer in use or exception is not being generated.
