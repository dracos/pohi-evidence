1 Management Summary

The purpose of this document is to identify ICL Pathway’s approach to the Training
and User Awareness Programme, as part of the implementation of the Horizon system
at post offices.

ICL Pathway Limited is a wholly owned subsidiary of ICL (International Computers
Limited) and has been formed in response to the needs of Post Office Counters
Limited (POCL) and the Benefits Agency (BA) to automate the nation’s post offices
key service functions, in particular benefit payments.

ICL Pathway has engaged a number of sub-contractors to deliver this programme and
ICL Peritas has been selected to design, develop, deliver and manage the Training and
User Awareness Programme. ICL Peritas is the UK’s leading provider of Information
Technology related training.

This document is being updated to reflect the changes that have been made to the
Training and User Awareness Programme since the last ICL Pathway baseline
document submitted in November 1995 as part of ICL Pathway’s contractual solution.
The reasons for the changes are covered in some detail by the associated documents
referenced. The following points summarise the key changes which have been
implemented :-

e The User Awareness event is no longer mandatory as proposed, but will be strongly
recommended by POCL for all staff to attend, especially managers and
subpostmasters.

e The user training has been changed from a four hour evening event followed by
supported workbook based consolidation and learning to either a one day or one
and a half day classroom training event (dependent upon job role).

e The competence test now takes place at the end of the extended classroom training
event as stated above.

e There will be no workbook based learning in the baseline training solution for
National Roll Out. Workbook based exercises will however be provided and are
recommended for use back at the outlet. Workbook based learning will be
considered for training on new software releases.

e The proposed After Care Visit (Training Review Visit) will not be undertaken by
ICL Pathway.

¢ There will no longer be a specialist training help desk to support distance learning.
The renamed Training Administration Centre will support user bookings and
rescheduling activities and will also accept queries regarding workbook exercises
via the Horizon System Help Desk.

This is by no means an exhaustive list of changes but identifies the key areas that have
been altered in response to the various discussions which have taken place.

The new training solution is represented in Figure 1 (and supersedes the diagram
shown in PATH-30-007, Section 2, page 4):

POCL shall use all reasonable endeavours to ensure that its Agents co-operate with
ICL Pathway to the extent reasonably necessary to permit ICL Pathway to perform the
training services described in this document.

Training pre National Roll Out

Horizon Releases 1a to 1c

The replanning of the implementation programme for Horizon into controlled phases
has meant that the awareness and training events received by the users has had to be
redefined. In line with best practice and contractual requirements, users will need to
receive training associated with the functionality of the system or upgrade. Training

should use (where appropriate) existing processes and procedures which have been
defined for Live Trial and National Rollout though no formal Service Level
Agreement (SLA) measurement will apply for Release 1a to Ic training

The phasing of the implementation of Horizon functionality also means that some
outlets will require upgrade training as the facilities and services available to them are
expanded.

The ICL Pathway Horizon Training for Release 1a to 1c document (dated 24/10/97,
reference IM/STR/0019) describes the training programme for the different releases of
Horizon and how it will be implemented. This has been agreed and signed off by
POCL.

User Awareness & Training Development

The User Awareness programme is being developed to encompass the split in
implementation between the new infrastructure programme and the main
implementation programme (this is described in detail in ICL Pathway
Implementation Programme Proposal document, reference IM/DOC/004).

The User Awareness event is aimed at ALL users working within, or providing
support to, post offices. The purpose of the event is to provide a understanding of the
impact the impending installation and automation programme will have on them as
individuals and their outlet as a whole. The overall aim is to elevate concern users
may have of the Horizon system and encourage participation during training and
installation.

Description

The Horizon training portfolio will comprise:

e User Awareness event (2.5 hours)

¢ Subpostmaster/POCL Managers course (1.5 days)
e Counter Assistants Course (1 day)

e POCL Train the Trainer course (5 days)

© Other POCL staff specialist course (up to 2 days) based upon the postmaster or
outlet manager course for non users of the platform and other POCL staff as
defined in ICL Pathway TNA document. This will also cover any staff who will be
changing role to a management function. It is expected that these will be
identified by POCL as part of an agreed booking process and procedure between
ICL Pathway and POCL.

The objective of the training is to ensure that all staff who work in post offices are
competent in the use of the automated platform, are aware of the impact on
operational procedures of that platform and that specialist staff are provided with the
appropriate additional information to perform their job role within an automated post
office. (Para 1)

The proposed solution offers three main training streams, namely:- (Para 2)

Managers (Cross reference 2.3.1 “Managers”)

e A 1.5 day contiguous training event delivered over two days to include venue set
up and clear down. (Bullet point 1)

e This course would be targeted at staff who are required to understand the full
functionality of the automated platform. (Bullet point 4)

e It is understood that all management grades will need this training. It is also
understood that other staff may perform these tasks, in some cases as back up, and
they will also need the Managers training event. (Bullet point 5)

Counter staff (Cross reference 2.3.1 “Counter staff”)

e A one day contiguous training event. (Bullet point 1)

© It is recognised that some of these staff, who perform some management functions,
will attend the above 1.5 day event instead of this one as more fully defined in
paragraph 8.3 of this document. (Bullet point 5)

managers but tailored to meet the needs of the central audit office of the Post
Office. The same course will be taken by computer auditors and regional

auditors. (Para 1)
POCL Train the Trainer

This 5 day course is aimed at existing POCL trainers, who will be training
both existing staff and new staff on the automated counter transaction system.

referral. This is documented by POCL as part of their contractual response to CAR
531.000.03, reference BP/PRD/006.

Assumptions

Remedial training is only completed when the staff member successfully completes a
competency test. Staff failing to achieve the standard on a third attempt will be
referred to the Regional POCL representative or POCL manager for review. This
referral will be the next working day after failing the third attempt.

There will be no remedial training for POCL trainers, Auditors or non counter staff
personnel.

Installation is under threat if users do not attend remedial training and meet Minimum
Training Compliance within the contractual window of 5 days from installation.

Pass rate for competency tests is 90%.

Dependencies

POCL to mandate training and remedial training as part of POCL’s communication
cascade. POCL Regional teams will target known outlets where attendance on
previous programmes has been poor to encourage and stress attendance during
Rollout.

POCL to advise and document informing ICL Pathway on how to manage relief
managers and their training during Rollout. This should be a documented process
agreed by all parties i.e. POCL Regions prior to commencement of Live Trial and
National Rollout invitations.

Availability of POCL staff and users in outlets. (Cross reference to 2.8
“Dependencies” - Bullet point 1 reworded)

Attitude of POCL staff and users to achieving the required competency standard and
retaking a test. It is assumed that POCL staff and users will accept the requirement to
achieve the required standard as mandated by POCL. In the event of this not being the
case the ICL Pathway trainer will refer the case to ICL Pathway Programme Managers
via the Rollout database and to POCL nominated representatives via ICL Pathway’s
sub-contractor exception reports.

All users who are to be tested must have been briefed by POCL such that the
requirements of the Data Protection Act have been met.

Process for mandating training and remedial training is managed by POCL (for more
information please refer to POCL CAR  532.000.03 document reference
BP/PRD/007).
