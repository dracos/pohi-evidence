Hi Saf

Yes, this captures our thinking and aims for the future and also encapsulates a lot of what we saw in
Vennells' evidence that remains areas for significant improvement.

I think we suggested instead of calling it an oversight committee a PM Advisory Committee sounded
better. This committee should have a clear mandate and terms of reference, bring together voices
from across the PM community, meet 4-6 times a year, and aim to educate and guide senior POL
members on the impact of proposals and strategies, ensuring a PM-centric approach in all our
activities. It should have the authority to call upon senior POL members to explain and challenge
what is working and what is not. It should also provide overwatch on PM investigations.

The lack of automation is shocking and needs the be right at the top of agenda - it is the only way to
build a sustainable network and if we ran our own network would have been invested in years ago.

On the point of candour - we must embrace the "uncomfortable" (such as the GT report) and stop
seeking to rewrite analysis for a better view rather than face into the changes we need to make.

Finally, the lack of Corporate Memory is a major problem - sighted by Vennells too and still a lesson
unlearned - we risk losing the learnings and experience in the desire to replace positive challenge
(No NEDs older than Saf and Elliot in situ, with many not looking to do a second term).
