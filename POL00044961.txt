I recently wrote to Mr Julian Wilson, former Subpostmaster, Astwood Bank PO, seeking repayment of
the outstanding amount of £28551.98p (the attached letter refers please). I have now received a reply
from the solicitors acting on behalf of Mr Wilson (to see the letter in the e-mail below please) and they
refer me to your good self. In view of the comments put forward in the letter can you please confirm
that recovery of the outstanding debt is now being pursued through the courts? Many thanks.
