Paul, 6 te ad

Summary of Issues ¢ 7 ~

As you know, Wendy and I are working with John and Jeremy on the Strategic Concui

Process. We had our first Supplier visit yesterday (with Cardlink) and it became quite cl
that our requirements process is lacking in 3 major areas.

* Reconciliation / Role of TIP \

* Office Balance / Cash accounting process 0 (L

* Interfaces with the TMS

The suppliers (Cardlink in particular) have capability in these areas, which has not been
properly harnessed. John and Jeremy have done an excellent job (with no formal
requirements) in keeping the supplier options open, but they are reaching a critical point of
‘freezing’ designs, and going firm on a single option. If we don't give them the direction
(which they are desparately seeking) they are very likely to choose an option which is not i
our best interests.

therefore their design)
are dependent upon

jeopardised.
