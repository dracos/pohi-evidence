Horizon losses.During mid. 2007 we incurred several small/med. losses amounting to £2500 usually friday to saturday or sat

to monday on the horizon balance system [I assumed operator error,which normally came back from Chesterfield as an Error Notice
to correct on the next account ],then during Oct 2007 £1000,Nov 07 £1500 Jan 2008 £2000 and Mar.08 £6000 [rounded figures] all
of which,although thoroughly checked by ourselves remain unexplained. These losses were reported to horizon and thankfully
correctly accounted for,they were also discussed at great length at several meetings 2007 till jan 2012 with our Area Sales Manager
Tony Sanghera who from the outset was insistant that,1. "We were the only office in the country experiencing such problems." He
never changed his stance.[]Since jan 2012 our new ASM has no information on the subject.] 2. He also reported that"Horizon and
the Post Office had carried out a deep forensic accounting investigation [the results of which they never disclose] and that senior
management had concluded that the losses were due to an inhouse conspiracy,[as several different staff were on duty on the loss
days] and caused solely by my poor management technique".The entire losses had to be made good ,which they were.My initial
questions are 1. 2007 to2012 The Post Office management knew of many offices in a similar position so was this a prearranged
standard riposte from the ASM.[As most postmasters were told this] was this to isolate us? .2. I now do not believe that the Post
Office carried out such a deep forensic accounting exercise, if so,they would not have lost/mislaid/misfiled the results [we dont
work like that] is this a standard prearranged reply? We thought we were on our own,until an article appeared in Counters News
BF115/03 feb 2013.[The elephant was in the room,Sorry.]For your information I retire on the Sth nov.as the office will convert to a
Mains,lve been on the counter at eastwood since 1979 my business partner lan Wood now retiring has over 40 years service and our
“have 70 plus years of counters working.
