2. Introduction

This Briefing Book has been prepared to explain the Post Office Limited results for the half
year ended 23 September 2012. It is a summary of the key data, trends and analyses to be
read in conjunction with the Trading Statement, which readers may find useful to further their
own understanding of the results for 2012-13. Post Office Limited has opted not to take
advantage of the Companies Act exemption from the preparation of consolidated accounts as
it is a wholly owned subsidiary within the Royal Mail Holdings plc group which prepares group
accounts. The Trading Statement therefore reports consolidated results.

Most of the analyses are based on the comparison of the half year's actual results to prior
year.

Comparison against budget is discussed in the Monthly Performance Report presented to the
Post Office Limited Board on a monthly basis.

3. Accounting policies

There have been no changes to the accounting policies in the current year that have had a
material impact on the financial information reported in the Annual Report and Financial
Statements.

Costs
N /

5.2 Explanations for some of the movements above are as follows:

* Revenue explanation is in section 6.1.

* The £4.6m increase in Staff costs was mainly due to:
o. Pay awards, and higher Productivity & Bonus costs
o Higher temporary resource costs driven by recruitment to support various
projects and higher agency labour in Network. Year on year the headcount
figure has increased by 213.

« Agents’ cost are £3.5m lower than last year due to a one off payment of £400 made
in June 2011 to all agents to maintain stability in the network.

* Non people costs (including project one off costs) were higher by £22.6 mainly due to:

o £16.6m higher project one off costs (POOC),

o Last year’s costs included a £2.4m release relating to WHS TUPE transfers,

o £0.5m increase in compensation which includes a reassessment of the personal
injury provision,

o £1.8m increase in marketing expenditure,

o £1.7m increase in property costs,

o higher cost of sales by £1.8m mainly due higher UKBA volumes as a result of
rolling out more ID Services terminals and also due to higher Retail costs due
to the Olympic and Jubilee collectables, partially offset by;

o £1.9m lower Interbusiness costs as a result of Separation.

Services Lottery Services ‘Subsidy
Payment
X yy,

The increase in year on year external revenue of £26.8m (7%) to £432.3m (2011 £405.5m)
is driven by the £13m increase in the Network Subsidy payment and an increase of £13.8m
in like for like income.

The following commentary gives further detail on the external revenue variances by category:

6.1.1 Government Services
The £0.8m (1%) decrease in Government Services revenue is principally due to:

* £2.2m lower DVLA revenues as volumes are below the minimum guaranteed income
levels and a one-off Service Level Agreement payment last year, and

* £1.0m adverse from falling numbers of POCA accounts through natural attrition and
migration of customers to bank accounts.

This was offset by
WITNO0740129
WITNO0740129

Exhibit WITNO0740129

* £1.9m higher revenues from the new UKBA contact.

6.1.2 Retail & Lottery
Retail and Lottery revenues have increased by £1.9m:
« Lottery is flat with last year, with both periods seeing high levels of rollovers,

* Retail up £1.9m benefiting from collectibles for the Olympic and Paralympic
games as well as the Jubilee.

6.1.3 Telephony
Year on year increase in Telephony of £2.1m (3.5%) has resulted from:
* 22k more customers, following last year’s Q4 marketing campaign, offset by;

* A decrease in E Top Up revenues of £0.8m is due to volume reduction.

6.1.4 — Financial Services

Financial Services income has increased by £3.3m (2.5%) year on year. This continues the
trend of increases in new products offsetting the decline of traditional products. The main
variances are:

* a £7.7m increase in POFS products particularly savings related products (Growth
Bonds, Instant Saver and Reward Saver - £2.6m, £1.8m and £1.4m favourable
respectively). This includes the benefit of the renegotiated commission rates
following the ‘Eagle’ deal, and

* a £0.2m increase in ATM revenue, driven by increased volumes as machines reach
maturity.

This was offset by

* a £1.7m decline in NS& revenues as NS&I look to provide some of their products,
particularly savings, through their own direct channel,

* a £1.5m decrease in Banking revenue from:

o a £1.6m fall from the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) as volumes
continue to fall as the Government is migrating customers to other payment
methods, and

o a £0.4m fall in Santander business revenues due to rate reduction from
renegotiated contract, offset by

o anincrease of £0.5m in personal banking.

* flat revenues from Payment Services due to:

o a £0.7m decline from bill payments, as utilities and other bill payment clients
continue to migrate customers to other payment methods such as direct debit
and online, and

o a £0.7m increase in Postal Order income (including write back of uncashed
Postal orders over 2 years old).

WITNO0740129

6.1.5 Other
Year on Year increase of £7.3m was due to:

* a £6.5m movement due to the MDA (agreement post Separation) excluding Mailwork
income from internal revenue (see 6.2.2). This will be corrected for year end, and

* an increase in Gamma income of £1.2m due to a change in the way the payments
are structured.

This was offset by

* a £0.4m reduction from marketing services, primarily Photo Booth income where
volumes and rates have reduced.

XL J

The following commentary gives further detail on the £2.4m internal revenue variances:

6.2.1 Mails

The £7.7m (4.7%) increase in Mails Revenue is driven by strong volumes accounting for
£6.4m of the increase and £1.3m driven by price.

* Approximately £3.4m of the £6.4m volume variance was driven by stamp sales
ahead of the price rise in April.

* The new Mails Distribution Agreement resulted in a reduction in fixed fee of £15.7m
which is more than offset by increases in variable commissions of £17.0m resulting
in a net price variance of £1.3m.

The £5.3m decrease in other is due to:

income from internal revenue. This will be corrected for year-end (see 6.1.5) offset
by £1.5m increase in Swindon Stores income as a result of Olympic stamp storage.

There were 8,061 Agents at the half year-end 23 September 2012 (2011 8,207). The 146
(2%) reduction in Agents is mainly due to natural attrition in the Post Office network.

The average annual cost per Agency branch (excluding VAT and NI) is £42,283 (2011
£43,394), a 3% decrease which is mainly due to a move away from fixed pay.

£400.

7.3.2 Collection, Delivery & Conveyance charges have generally remained flat year on year.

7.3.3 Compensation costs have increased by £3m mainly due to a one off provision release
relating to the CWU TUPE claim for the WHS transfers in 2011-12 of £2m.

7.3.4 Property Facilities costs have increased by £1m due to external venue costs relating to
Post Office Vision events and cross company electricity charges.

number of Post & Go machines requiring annual maintenance.

7.3.6 Vehicles costs have remained flat.
7.3.7 Computers and Telephones costs have generally remained flat year on year.

7.3.8 Consultancy, Marketing & Legal Fees have increased by £8m mainly due to the higher

and spend for ‘point of sale’ and rebranding. Note that the increase is charged to
projects through the Staff and Agent Related line below.

7.3.9 Staff and Agent related Costs & Consumables have decreased by £5m due to
increased number of programmes which has resulted to higher recharges to projects.

7.3.10 Finance costs have increased by £2m due to a one off purchase order benefit last year
of £0.5m and increased Bureau and ATM losses.

9.6 Loss on disposal of fixed assets (2012/13 £39m vs. 2011/12 E£nil)

The associate investment with the Bank of Ireland - in Midasgrange Ltd (POFS) - was
disposed of in August 2012. The balance sheet carrying value at the time was £32.4m.
Sale proceeds were £2.7m and a loss on disposal of £29.7m has been included in the
half year results.

9.7 _ Profit on property disposals (2012/13 £2m vs 2011/12 £nil)

In September 2012 the freehold property of the former Crown office at Woking was
sold for £1.75m (NBV £24.0k). There were no equivalent disposals in the first half of
2011/12.

10. ‘Interest, cash, debt, funding, hedging and going concern

10.1 Going concern

Post Office Ltd has net cash and cash equivalents of some £771m (March 2012 £443m) and
a borrowing facility of some £1,150m of which £127m (March 2012 £377m) was drawn
down. The improvement is driven by the receipt of £200m Government grant in addition to
the upfront receipt of the full year NSP of £210m.

The going concern position has been reviewed and the year-end assessment (below) is still
applicable.

10.2 Background

On 24 March 2010 a further funding agreement was agreed that provided up to £180m for
compensation for losses sustained in parts of the network in 2011-12 as well as providing
access to the working capital facility to 31 March 2016. These arrangements received State
Aid approval on 23 March 2011 though the working capital facility was limited until 31 March
2012.

A further funding agreement with Government was announced on 27 October 2010 which
provided for:

Funding of £410m for 2012-13 (recieved 2 April 2012)

Funding of £415m for 2013-14

Funding of £330m for 2014-15

Extension of the existing working capital facility of £1.15bn up to 31 March 2016.

eee ®

State Aid approval for the funding for 2012-13 to 2014-15 was received on 28 March 2012
and it was also recognised that the working capital facility was no longer deemed State Aid.

The going concern analysis is based on the latest strategic plan refresh prepared and noted by
the Post Office Limited Board and Royal Mail Holdings plc Board in October 2010. This was
updated to reflect the 2012-13 budget process and an updated view of the later years as at
March 2012. The Post Office Board approved the 2012-13 budget on 15 March 2012 and
has undertaken an initial review of the later years.

10.3. Assessment for POL

POL has finished implementing its 2005-11 strategic plan and has completed its closure
programme. It posted an operating profit before exceptional items for the first time for a
number of years in 2008-09 and has continued to do so but still operates with a cash
outflow. The 2011-15 plan is intended to reverse the trend of an increasing Network
Subsidy Payment (NSP).

The 2011-15 strategic plan, updated for latest views, has been shown in section 11 and
shows that POL has sufficient cash headroom to continue to trade. The available facility has
been defined to include network cash, ATM cash, ATM debtor, POCA debtor and SGEI
cheques. Headroom was increased as the result of a more widely defined criterion for use of
the Working Capital Facility (WCF). In the EC’s decision of 23 March 2011 they noted that

20
WITNO0740129
WITNO0740129

Exhibit WITNO0740129

“the WCF is provided on condition that it is used for financing the cash and near-cash
requirements involved in delivering the SGEls...” and not limited it to cash for cash-withdrawal
Services of General Economic Interest (SGEI) as previously. Therefore the WCF can now be
used to finance all SGEI working capital requirements in particular those associated with
HMRC cheques in January and July. This will mean the peak funding requirement from non-
WCF sources will no longer be required for those months. This change has had a positive
effect on all months of c£40m.

Other changes introduced in the one year funding deal for 2011-12 included the ability to
borrow up to £50m from other sources as well as the up to £50m in finance leases
previously allowed which would improve the headroom capacity if required.

10.4 Summary conclusion

Based on the analysis there is available borrowing headroom remaining until March 2015.
Royal Mail Group Limited is a key trading partner with POL and, in arriving at the conclusion
that POL is a going concern, the assumption is made that Royal Mail Group Limited is a going
concern or that an alternative mails provider would work similarly with POL providing a
similar level of income.

It is believed that POL will be able to meet its liabilities as they fall due in the foreseeable
future. It is therefore expected that the POL directors will consider it appropriate to continue
to prepare the accounts on a going concern basis.

Notes:
2011-12 shows the year end outturn and last years are the latest view of the strategic
plan.

Available facilities are defined as network cash, ATM cash, ATM debtor, POCA debtor and SGEI cheques.

Table 1
This table shows the October 2010 strategic plan cashflow updated for the 2012-13 budget and latest
reviews of subsequent years. It demonstrates positive headroom throughout the plan period.

Table 2
This table sets out the impact of theoretical downside scenarios if the plan does not generate
the income streams anticipated and if the pension scheme costs increase.

Clearly mitigating management actions could be initiated but there remains sufficient
headroom even if they are not taken. There are a range of management actions including
implementing non-staff cost saving initiatives and closing non NSP offices without
compensation, and the overriding principle is that management will take whatever action is
required to mitigate any risk that materialises.

Joint ventures

During 2012-13 and 2011-12 Post Office Limited’s joint venture investment was a 50%
interest in First Rate Exchange Services Holdings Limited with a carrying value of £90m

(2011 £96m), whose principal activity is the provision of Bureau de Change.

Associates

During 2012-13 and 2011-12, Post Office Limited’s associate investment was a 49.99%
interest in Midasgrange Limited with a carrying value of £nil (2011 £22m), whose
principal activity is the provision of personal financial products. Midasgrange Limited
trades as Post Office Financial Services and is a company registered in the United
Kingdom. During the period POL waived £11m due under Gamma in return for a C share.
The share was deemed of nil value and was immediately impaired. This investment was
disposed of in August 2012 by the sale of POL’s interest to the Bank of Ireland.

14. Litigation and Claims- Potential Claims regarding Horizon.

14.1 Post Office Ltd has received notification of five potential claims from former
subpostmasters. Each of these subpostmasters had their appointments terminated
following the discovery at audit of significant cash losses at their respective branches.
Two of the subpostmasters were subsequently prosecuted and pleaded guilty to false
accounting.

14.2 Each has claimed wrongful termination of contract on the basis that the losses are
alleged to have arisen due to the unfairness of the system devised by Post Office Ltd
and/or have been generated by a computer error in the Horizon system. More
specifically, it is alleged that (a) the accounting procedures in place are unfair in that
they do not permit subpostmasters to properly verify losses which are alleged to have
been incurred, (b) the Horizon system itself contains inherent defects and/or (c) the
training and support for subpostmasters using the system is inadequate,

14.3 Each subpostmaster is claiming circa £150,000 by way of damages.

14.4 Four of the claims remain at the pre-action stage (i.e. there are no live court
proceedings). Post Office Ltd has strongly denied liability and rebutted the allegations
made. The fifth claim was struck out by the Court and cannot be pursued further.

14.5 The last correspondence received on these matters was in December 2011. Post
Office Ltd is not aware of any further substantive steps having been taken to advance
these claims through the Courts since that date.

14.6 Post Office Ltd continues to receive challenges to the integrity of the Horizon system
and it is possible that further claims may be received. Reports in the press have
previously suggested that solicitors Shoosmiths may have consulted on between 85
and 150 potential cases in total.

14.7 Several subpostmasters have also made complaints about Horizon to Members of
Parliament. Post Office Ltd has commissioned an independent third party, Second
Sight Support Services Ltd, to investigate an initial sample of sixteen cases where
allegations have been made that the Horizon system is the source of unresolved
accounting shortages. That investigation is ongoing.

14.8 Post Office Ltd is also actively considering proposals from Justice for Subpostmasters
Alliance, an organisation “established to raise awareness of the issues within the Post
Office Horizon system”, to develop a system by which individual subpostmasters can
raise concerns with Horizon within a “no blame” framework.

14.9 On the basis of the evidence to date, no provision has been made and it is not
considered appropriate to make any disclosure on this matter. This position is being
actively monitored.
