Kelly Tolhurst call with Tim Parker, Al Cameron and Jane MacLeod

Suggested speaking points:

Obviously a very disappointing judgment, but reassured to see POL are taking this very
seriously and will be taking action

Whilst these are operational matters, as the Minister responsible I need to ensure the
findings in terms of both the contracts with postmasters, and also the criticism of POL’s
culture and practices, are addressed. What action are POL taking as a result of the judgment
and how we will you keep me informed of progress to provide assurance this action is
effective? Who will lead this work now Paula has stepped back and how will you (Tim)
ensure strong leadership is shown on this?

Parliament will rightly hold me to account, I expect this to be raised in BEIS Oral Questions
next week and in meetings I regularly have with MPs. Therefore, important POL are sharing
information with BEIS on this on a regular basis.

Concern I often hear from MPs is that being a postmaster is becoming less attractive with
changes to renumeration — this judgment will add to that concern. What comms are POL
doing with postmasters on the judgment and how will you address their concerns?

Concerned that the legal advice POL received appears to have been wide of the mark on the
likely outcome of this trial, are you considering any changes to your strategy for the
remaining trials? As you discussed with Alex Chisholm recently, we have learned from
previous experience that it’s very important to have independent legal advice in relation to
strategy from now on to guard against the existing legal team being wedded to the existing
approach.

I understand POL will consult BEIS on any intention to appeal prior to doing so
