Key fact 15pts ahead of benchmark on colleague motivation to do their best

What you should know

* Colleague motivation is high and rising, outdistancing the UK Norm by a large margin.

+ Advocacy has also grown since 2022, but pride is falling and now trails the benchmark by 9pts.

+ Only three in five say they feel a strong sense of belonging (-13pts vs. UK Norm).

* Double-digit declines in engagement find People and Legal, Compliance and Governance least engaged (55% and 59%
respectively).

+ Engagement falls among middle grades, most notably Band 4 (-9pts vs. 2022).

What you should consider

+ High motivation suggests that colleagues are committed and feel compelled to do their best. However, if pride continues to
decline and a sense of belonging remains scarce, motivation may be at risk of falling in tandem.

+ Explore what is driving the notable decline in engagement among Band 4 colleagues. Is this ‘squeezed middle’ struggling to
balance asks from below with those from above?
