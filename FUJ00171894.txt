The problem will only occur in exceptional circumstances but should be fixed in case the exceptional
circumstance happens.

If it does occur, transaction gap information is overwritten in the results spreadsheet and we would not be
able to send the ARQ to POL. We would probably attempt to resolve the cause of the gaps or duplicates
before sending the output to POL in any case, but the problem really ought to be fixed.

lsummary: LST R03,24 - Audit - Transaction Gap info overwritten in Summary worksheet
incident Description:

hen there are gaps in the message transaction sequence, this information is written to the Summary worksheet in the Query output
spreadsheet.
in some circumstances this information can be over written with the actual query text.

Itt appears to be caused by the system determining the spreadsheet row in which to insert the query text, from the last used
Dupicate row rather than the last used Gap or Dupicate row.

example of Query output file attached.
comments:

Sohn Rogers <rogers}>, 18/01/2011 08:26:14:
raising at "B" priority as the Query output may be used in court cases.
