Subject: RE: Request for ARQ Extract

Raj,

Please can you retrieve similar info for the following Branches:

1. FAD 327518 (Yetminster Outreach Services) between 1% January 2011 and 31% December 2011.

2. FAD 255518 (Chetnole) between 1% January 2011 and 31% December 2011. Please note, I suspect that this
branch has never traded and so don’t be surprised if no data is found (but I would like that confirmed please)!

3. FAD 171937 (Liss) between 1% July 2009 and 30" September 2009.

This work should be chargeable to the “Second Sight” CP I mentioned yesterday. If there is no more cover on that

then please let me know and I'll take it up with Pete Newsome.

Regards

Gareth

Hi Gareth,

No problem - I have set the retrievals off now and should be able to get all the information by Friday if not earlier however I am
not in the office on Wednesday and Thursday we have an audit taking place so not sure whether I will have time, however I will

try and get this to you ASAP.

Thanks

Raj,

There was a significant bug on HNG-X that affected about 14 branches that was identified earlier this year that is
causing some interest with high levels of management in POL and Fujitsu.

Anne Chambers has done some detailed analysis based on info in BRDB / BRSS, but I think it would be helpful to pull
back the transaction logs for the relevant periods to confirm the analysis.

Please can you get data back for Branch 011458 (by that I mean the normal ARQ extracts, plus the raw XML files and
filtered and unfiltered events) for the following time periods:

1. 1% November 2010 to 10" January 2011
2. 1 January to 12" February 2012
3. 1 January to 10" February 2013

Do you need anything more formal that this email?

I'd appreciate an estimated time frame for retrieving this asap.
Thanks

Regards

Gareth
