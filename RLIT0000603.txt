Post Office and Horizon redress: Instruction to deliver 3

Report

Background

1. The Post Office Horizon scandal is one of the worst miscarriages of justice in British
history. Between 1999 and 2015, the Post Office pursued sub-postmasters after errors in
the Post Office’s IT system, Horizon, caused false shortfalls to show in financial accounts.1
The Post Office demanded that sub-postmasters covered those shortfalls. Some sub-
postmasters were suspended, usually without pay; some sub-postmasters were dismissed;
and some sub-postmasters were prosecuted, convicted and imprisoned for false accounting
and theft. Sub-postmasters experienced reputational damage, mental and physical health
problems and financial ruin. Several of them took their own life.2

2. In 2016, a group of 555 sub-postmasters and employees (‘the 555’) took the Post
Office to the High Court via a Group Litigation Order. The judge ruled in the 555’s favour,
stating that even after improvement, the Horizon IT system was not “remotely” robust.3
Following that ruling, the Group Litigation Order (GLO) compensation scheme, the
Horizon Shortfall Scheme (HSS) and the Overturned Convictions scheme were established
to compensate victims.

Business and Trade Committee scrutiny

3. The Business and Trade Committee first scrutinised the Horizon scandal in March
2020 and published an interim Report on 17 February 2022.4 We revisited the issue of
financial redress for affected sub-postmasters in two evidence sessions on 16 January
and 27 February 2024. In the January evidence session, we heard from affected sub-
postmasters, campaigners, lawyers, the current CEO of Post Office Ltd, the Director of
Fujitsu, Department for Business and Trade officials and the Minister for Enterprise,
Markets and Small Business, Kevin Hollinrake MP. At our February oral evidence session,
we took evidence from sub-postmasters, Department for Business and Trade officials,
legal representatives, Post Office Ltd executives and the former Chairman of Post Office
Ltd, Henry Staunton.

Role of Post Office in delivering redress

4, The Post Office runs two financial redress schemes, the Horizon Shortfall Scheme
and the Overturned Convictions process. In addition, it plays a key role in the GLO
scheme, because it discloses the evidence to sub-postmasters that sub-postmasters must
provide when submitting a claim. We have consistently expressed concern about the Post
Office’s involvement in financial redress, because at the height of the scandal the Post

Office acted as “judge, jury and executioner” when convicting sub-postmasters.5 In our
February 2022 Report, we recommended that an independent intermediary body should
be set up to assist sub-postmasters in seeking financial redress, including providing
claimants with access to forensic accountants and legal experts who could advise on sub-
postmasters’ claims. The Government rejected that recommendation, arguing that setting
up sucha body would take significant time.6 We regret that the Government rejected that
recommendation.

5. At the oral evidence session on 27 February 2024, we heard that the Post Office still
suffers from a “toxic” culture and a complete lack of trust between the company and sub-
postmasters. When we asked former sub-postmasters whether the culture of the Post
Office had changed, they all replied “no” and were unable to identify any aspects of the
Post Office that have changed positively.7 Alan Bates observed:

Over the years that I have been dealing with Post Office, the culture has
always been Post Office. It has not changed; it has been the same for donkey’s
years. It will not change and you cannot change it.8

6. We also heard that the Post Office caused delays in financial redress sought by
sub-postmasters. James Hartley, a lawyer representing GLO claimants, said that it was
“inescapable” that there was a degree of incompetence and inefficiency when it came to
disclosing evidence to sub-postmasters. Mr Hartley estimated that on average it took the
Post Office six months to disclose records to allow claimants to submit a claim.9 Dr Neil
Hudgell, who represents claimants from the Horizon Shortfall Scheme and Overturned
Convictions, identified similar disclosure delays by the Post Office. He cited a case in
which he had been waiting for disclosure since July 2023, which amounts to a seven-
month delay at the time of writing.10 He added that in all cases with which he was familiar
on the Horizon Shortfall Scheme, no postmasters had received full and fair redress:

I would love to sign off as many as I can and tell people, “Look: this is a
decent outcome. Try to get on with the rest of your life”, but I cannot find
them. In every case something is missing. 11

7. Whe Post Office ruined the lives of innocent sub-postmasters. It subsequently
failed to facilitate redress. Unsurprisingly, sub-postmasters have no confidence in the
Post Office. he Post Office’s leadership remains in disarray; its chairman has been
dismissed; and its chief executive, Nick Read, is under internal investigation.12 Mr
Read concurred that reform of the Post Office’s culture is still a “work in progress,”

5 During the scandal, the Post Office used its own investigation branch to bring private prosecutions against
its staff. It did this under the general right in English law for individuals and organisations to pursue private
prosecutions without using the Crown Prosecution Service. For more information, please see “ Post Office
scandal puts private prosecutions in dock,” Financial Times, 11 January 2024

and not “job done.” 13 In that context, we note that Mr Read has supplied misleading
evidence to the Committee on at least two counts, relating to the Post Office’s use of,
first, non-disclosure agreements and, secondly, public relations firms. 14 15 Khe Post
Office is not fit for purpose to administer any of the schemes of redress required to
make amends for one of the biggest miscarriages of justice in British history.

8. The Government must immediately remove the Post Office from any involvement
in delivering redress for sub-postmasters and the Government should set out to the
Committee how it proposes to deliver swift and effective redress for sub-postmasters,
and in what legally binding timeframes. We repeat the Committee’s recommendation
that the Government set up a properly resourced independent intermediary to assist
sub-postmasters seeking to overturn convictions and seek compensation across all
redress schemes. This intermediary should provide claimants with access to forensic
accountants and legal experts who can offer advice to help ensure that claims are robust
as possible, that offers take account of all the losses suffered and that claimants do not
suffer significant detriment because records have not been kept by the Post Office or
other relevant organisations.

Instruction to deliver

9. We identified unacceptable delays to delivering redress across all schemes. As a
result, only 20% of the budget set aside for redress has been paid out.16 Nick Read stated
that he neither received written instructions to accelerate payment of redress nor had a
conversation with the Secretary of State for Business and Trade, right hon. Kemi Badenoch
MP, about the need to accelerate payments.17 However, Mr Read also refuted the claims
of former Post Office Chairman, Henry Staunton, that instructions had been received to
slow the compensation process down, telling us “categorically” that neither he nor his
team have received instruction from the Government to slow compensation payments.18
The Director of Business Resilience, Carl Creswell, also denied that he received instruction
to slow payments, stating that in recent conversations with Ministers he has been told to
“definitely go faster”.19 We note for the record that, under oath, Mr Staunton stood by his
claims.20

10. The Director of Business Resilience, Department for Business and Trade, Carl
Creswell, told us that 147 out of a possible 478 applications (30.75%) have been submitted
to the GLO scheme and that only 55% of the necessary disclosure reports have been
issued.21 Alarmingly, the Government's support team at Addleshaw Goddard is staffed by
just 15 people, of whom only eight are qualified lawyers.22 Consequently, when we asked

witnesses from Freeths and Hudgell solicitors how long they thought that it would take
for their clients to see full and final redress under the current arrangements, both gave a
ballpark figure of one to two years.23

ll. Complicating the submission of claims is the Government and Post Office’s
requirement for extensive medical and financial evidence, which in many cases is simply
not available to former sub-postmasters. Furthermore, the claims forms are extremely
complex. Simon Recaldin, Remediation Matters Director, Post Office, conceded that the
claim form for the Horizon Shortfall Scheme was not simple enough, admitting that
“there are a number of issues with this. First is the clumsiness, the bureaucracy and the
legalese in that application form.”24

12. We welcome the Government’s commitment to introduce a Bill to deliver remedies
for the wrongly convicted and tackle the unacceptable delays in delivering redress for sub-
postmasters.25 The Bill presents an opportunity for legislation to improve the certainty
of delivering redress across all schemes. Our Chair, right hon. Liam Byrne MP, proposed
on the Floor of the House including in that legislation a suggestion first made by Alan
Bates to the Minister for Enterprise, Markets and Small Business of “hard” timeframes for
reaching first offer and final settlement, with financial penalties awarded to the claimant
if these timeframes are missed. However, the Minister for Enterprise, Markets and Small
Business argued against setting a legally binding date, because the Government cannot
control when claims are received to be processed.26 None the less, the Minister told the
House of Commons that the Government would examine “all the various suggestions that
are made.’27

13. We acknowledge that setting legally binding timeframes to fix the total processing
time by which compensation claims must be concluded risks some cases not being
considered properly.28 To manage that risk, witnesses at our February 2024 oral evidence
session argued that it would be possible to set legally binding timeframes for each stage of
a compensation claim, beginning with a legally binding timeframe under which the Post
Office must issue the disclosure reports required for sub-postmasters to submit a claim,
followed by legally binding deadlines with penalties where subsequent deadlines are not
met.2 Sir Ross Cranston, the Independent Reviewer for the GLO Scheme, while noting
the risk that some cases may not be properly considered, nevertheless made it clear that
there is well-established legal precedent for enforcing such time periods:

[Yo]u could certainly escalate cases if you reached a timeline—in the law,
we often have deadlines, limitation periods and so on—so it could jump up
to the next stage.30

Alan Bates commented:

I think there should be penalties involved where they are not met, and
then those penalties should go to the victims [ ... ] That would then be
compensation for having to wait and delay.31

14. To correct the abject failure to deliver timely redress for sub-postmasters, the
Government must include in its forthcoming legislation legal timeframes to deliver
redress to sub-postmasters. Those targets should include binding timeframes for each
stage of a compensation claim, with financial penalties awarded to the claimant for
failure to meet those deadlines. To accelerate the submission of claims, the Government
must review and radically simplify the evidential requirements of the claims process,
especially in relation to medical impact, consequential loss and repetitional damage.

Fast and fair

15. The Committee was extremely concerned to hear that a significant number of initial
offers made by the Post Office to sub-postmasters for redress were insultingly low.32 The
claims process currently requires sub-postmasters to submit claims without knowing the
full extent of Post Office records regarding their personal situation or the range of case law
precedents used to calculate heads of loss in initial offer letters issued by the Post Office.
Former sub-postmasters do not have access to a standardised tariff to estimate such
losses.33 Furthermore, there has been a wholesale lack of clarity about the availability of
legal assistance, the cap on legal assistance and the ability to take an interim payment while
continuing to contest a claim. The initial legal support made available to sub-postmasters
was in no way commensurate to the legal firepower available to the Post Office. As such,
contests to settle final claims have been unbalanced by a substantial inequality of arms.

16. To ensure that offers of redress are fast and fair, the Government must:

a) Require full disclosures by the Post Office of the information needed to submit
full and fair claims within legally binding timeframes;

b) publish a standardised tariff of damages to help sub-postmasters claim the full
amount to which they are entitled;

c) remove the cap on legal expenses for sub-postmasters to contest their claims;

d) allow those who have already settled under the Horizon Shortfall Scheme to
revisit their claims to ensure that they have received fair redress; and

e) introduce a legally binding independent appeals mechanism.
