Paula

Please find attached the two documents we discussed yesterday:
The Generic Particulars of Claim is the Freeths document
The ‘Final version defence’ is our Defence filed yesterday in response.

Turning to the Defence document:
Paragraphs 1-20 of the Defence set out the high level response.

e Paragraphs 21-74 then address the factual matters. Horizon allegations are addressed at paras 33 —41 and 47-
60.

e Paragraphs 75- 190 discuss the legal basis of the claims.
e Finally, the counterclaim is set out in paragraphs 193-197.

As discussed last week, the factual matters stated have been reviewed internally by SMEs. The Horizon statements have
been reviewed by Fujitsu, Deloitte and IT. Rob discussed the wording of these paragraphs with BD on Monday.

Please let me know if you would like further information about any of the issues raised.
Kind regards,
Jane
