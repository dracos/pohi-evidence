This statement (consisting of two pages each signed by me) is true to the best of my knowledge and belief

Signature Rosemary Sporle

I am employed by Post Office Ltd as a Contracts Manager. I have worked for Post
Office Ltd for 20 years, of which the last eighteen months has been as Contracts
Manager. My responsibilities include the consistent deployment of all agency policies
and procedures relating to the contract for services of Subpostmasters, within a
defined geographical area. Furthermore, I advise Retail Line Managers and other
appropriate sections and business units, of the various conditions of the

Subpostmasters contract.

Subpostmasters are not employees of Post Office Ltd, but operate under a contract to
provide services on behalf of Post Office Ltd. Subpostmasters usually locate the actual
Post Office in premises in which they also run a private business. Under the terms of
the contract, Subpostmasters have sole responsibility for all stock and cash, and for all

daily and weekly accounting and administration in respect of the Post Office.

From records held I can state that Mr David Yates was the Subpostmaster at Walton on
Thames Post Office, from 13 September 1993 to 7" March 2003, when his contract

for services was suspended.

Continuation of statement of Rosemary Sporle

I now produce a copy of section 9(M) of the Modified Subpostmasters contract,
detailing the responsibility a Subpostmaster has for Post Office cash and stock, as item
RS/1.

as Subpostmaster between March 2002 and March 2003, as item RS/2.

The records to which I refer in this statement form part of the records relating to the
