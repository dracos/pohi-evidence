FUJITSU FUJITSU RESTRICTED (COMMERCIAL IN
CONFIDENCE)

1. Introduction

1.1 Owner

The owner of the Major Incident Management process at the local POA level is the Fujitsu POA Lead
SDM, Problem and Major Incident.

Objective

The key objective of the procedure is to ensure effective and efficient management of Major Incidents,
through:

« Improvement of communication channels

« Clarification of the need to communicate awareness of potential incidents.

e Improved accuracy of reporting of incident status

e Allowing technical teams the right amount of time to diagnose and impact an incident
e Avoiding unnecessary alerting of the service integrator and/or the customer

e Demonstrating a professional approach to Atos, the Service Integrator contracted to POL, and
Post Office Limited (the customer) and their clients.

e Provision of clearly defined roles and responsibilities
« Defined reporting and updating timelines throughout a major incident.
e Improved governance

e Assessing which incidents are major and which are ‘Business as Usual’

1.2 Rationale

This document outlines the communication and management procedure and guidelines to be used for
Major Incidents impacting the live estate.

The methodology defined within this document augments the existing SMS framework procedure
presently deployed within the live estate.

The aim of the document is to provide a pre-defined procedure for future major incident communication
and management.

2 Mandatory Guidelines

It is important to maintain a balance between:
a) Allowing the technical teams the right amount of time to diagnose and impact an incident
b) Avoiding unnecessary alerting of the customer
c) Assessing which incidents are major

The following guidelines should be adhered to.

e During the MAC Core Hours (Monday — Friday 08:00 — 20:00, Saturday 08:00 — 17:00) and Bank
Holidays 0800 — 1400 excluding Christmas Day. The MAC should be the first point of operational
contact between Fujitsu and the Atos Service Desk. Outside these hours the Atos Service Desk
or Atos OOH Duty Manager should contact the SMC. The SMC are responsible for escalation of
incidents to the POA OOH Duty Manager. The POA OOH Duty Manager may initiate
communications with the Atos OOH Duty Manger. The SMC operate on a 24 x 7 x 365 basis.

e Any activity detailed in this document which is assigned to the MAC team is handed over to the
SMC outside the MAC Core Hours, with the exception of the above.

e The relevant technical teams who are aware of and monitoring a potential major incident must
page / call the appropriate Major Incident Manager (Duty Manager out of hours) as soon as
possible. This is not limited to major incidents alone, but applies wherever a state other than
Business as Usual has been detected. The Major Incident Manager must in turn communicate
the potential incident, to the Atos Service Desk for awareness and monitoring in Atos. This is
usually done via the MAC team in core hours or via SMC out of hours.

« The Major Incident Manager (or Duty Manager out of hours) is responsible for communicating
both up the Fujitsu organisation and across (see appendix 10.3) to their counterpart in Atos.
Where this is impractical (e.g. leave, out of hours, unavailable), the initiative should be taken to
jump up the organisation. Of prime importance is that the customer is informed in a timely
manner and at the correct touch point. This communication should be by voice or direct SMS.
The communication should include the date, time, name, nature of problem, severity, if service
affecting, likely impact, and the Fujitsu owner to contact.

e The Major Incident Manager (Duty Manager OOH, who covers Monday to Friday 17:30 to 09:00
and from 17:00 Friday though to 09:00 Monday) should also initiate communication using SMS
via the MAC team (see operational hours above.). Outside of these hours the SMS should be via
the SMC. The SMS distribution list used is titled ‘SMS Internal’ and amongst others includes the
appropriate members of the POA Operations Management Team.

3 Definition of a Major Incident

3.1. Incident Classification

As a general rule a Major Incident will be an incident rated as a Business Critical Incident as shown in the
following

- The ‘CONTRACT’
- Sections 3.2 and 3.3 below.
- POA Operations Incident Management Procedure document (SVM/SDM/PRO/0018).

- A series of connected lower severity incidents which combine to have a significant business
impact.

However not all incidents rated as Severity 1 qualify as a Major Incident as the severity levels do not
always reflect the overall business impact to POL. For example a single counter post office which is
unable to trade, regardless of its business volumes, is rated as a Severity 1 incident.

For simplicity, incidents are classified into three impact levels: High, Medium and Low.

High — An Incident that has occurred with a significant and potentially prolonged adverse impact on POL
business. Typically these incidents will initially require a significant amount of reactive management
before they can be controlled and resolved.

Medium — An incident that has the potential to cause significant impact to POL business but can be
controlled and contained through effective management.

Low — An Incident that requires business attention but if managed effectively will not have significant
impact on POL business.

3.2. Influencing Factors in calling a Major Incident

It is important that a Major Incident is defined in accordance with section 3.3 Major Incident Triggers, as
such, because of its business impact on the day when it occurs, rather than simply being defined as a
Major Incident because it appears on a list. However the following parameters will also feed into the
consideration of whether a major incident should be called:

e Duration, i.e. how long has the vulnerability to service already existed?

« Impact across the estate, including consideration of whether a service is merely degraded or
actually stopped

«Time at which the event occurs in relation to the 24 hour business day
e Time of year —- e.g. Christmas / Easter / End of month / quarter

« Anticipated time before service can be resumed

e Impact to POL branches, customers, clients or brand image

e Business initiatives e.g. product launches

3.3. Major Incident Triggers

The following criteria could trigger a major incident, however as detailed in 3.2, the influencing factors
must also be considered. As such the list below is not exhaustive, whilst if an incident occurs which is
not detailed below, e.g., legislative, it should not necessarily be precluded from being declared a major
incident.

FUJITSU FUJITSU RESTRICTED (COMMERCIAL IN
CONFIDENCE)

It should be noted that any call trends in relation to the following, should be reported to the POA Duty
Manager as soon as the agreed threshold levels have been breached.

3.3.1 Network Triggers

Network Major Incident triggers are as follows:

e Complete or significant outage of the Central network, e.g. failure of both 3750 stack Catalyst
switches in totality for the Core layer in IRE11.

« Complete or significant outage of the Talk Talk network
« Complete or significant outage of VSAT sites
e Complete or significant outage of the ISDN network (whether C&W, BT or Kingston Comms)

3.3.2 Infrastructure Components Triggers
Infrastructure component Major Incident Triggers are as follows:
« Total loss of environments providing individual online service capability
« Breach of access to data centres
e Breach of security

° Virus outbreak

3.3.3. Data Centre Triggers

Data Centre Major Incident triggers are as follows:
e Network / LAN outage
e Loss of Data Centre, or significant loss of Data Centre Components
e Breach of security

3.3.4 Online Service Triggers
Online services Major Incident Triggers are as follows:
e Online service unavailable within the Data Centre (not counter level)

e Number of Branches without Communications Services — as defined by POL and in accordance
with Ping script thresholds.

e Third party provided service failure — e.g. DVLA, Link, Moneygram, Santander etc

N.B Once the third party service provider has been deemed to be the source of the Major
Incident; it will be managed by either POA or Atos Service Desk in accordance with whichever
organisation manages that supplier relationship.

3.3.5 Security Triggers
Security major incident triggers are as follows:

« Actual or suspected attacks on the Fujitsu Services Buildings and its resources, POA Network or
Information Systems

e Theft of IT equipment / property, and in particular PIN Pads
«= Theft of software

e Any PIN Pad Issues that are in breach of FIPS 140-1 level 3 and ISO 9564 1st Edition 1991
section 6.3.1 as specified in the LINK information security standard issued January 2001 (subject
to such dispensations from that standard as LINK may grant from time to time). The main criteria
being as follows:

The purpose of this Standard is to protect the LINK Network, its Members and their
cardholders and ATM owners from attacks designed to compromise sensitive data or
defraud financial institutions and their cardholders. This protection takes into account not
just the direct financial losses that may be incurred but also the potential reputational
damage to the LINK ATM Scheme and its Members and its impact on customer
confidence in LINK and ATMs in general. It is intended to protect the Link Brand:

+ The interests of the Members
+ The interests of the Members‘ customers
+ The reputation and integrity of the UK cash handling infrastructure

In the event of a Security Major Incident (which may also include PCI Incidents), the POA Security
Manager MUST be alerted who will then follow the Security Incident Management processes, as detailed
in both:

SVM/SDM/PRO/0018 Appendix A

SVM/SDM/PLA/0031 HNG-X Security Business Continuity Plan (defines the actions to be taken if
security violations are identified).

In the event of a Major Incident Security trigger for Fujitsu Services Buildings and its resources, the POA
Security Manager MUST inform the Group Property Security Team who will be alerted either by
telephone on a 24/7 basis or the next working day via our Incident Reporting process and the actual or
potential impact of the incident dictates which route is followed.

The Group Property Security Team will then take responsibility for interfacing into the corporate process
by entering reports on to the corporate system.

5 Calling the Major Incident

During business hours the Major Incident Manager declares and manages the Major Incident (with
handovers to the POA OOH Duty Manager where applicable.)

Where the impact of the incident is not immediately obvious, and it is not clear if a Major Incident should
be called, escalation and discussion with the POA Operations Management Team should occur, and a
collective decision made. If a Major Incident is not called, the incident should be monitored until closure,
to ensure that the impact does not increase to that of a Major Incident.

In the event that multiple services are impacted, multiple Major Incident Managers may be appointed by
any Tower Lead and will remain in their roles until incident closure.

Out of hours the POA OOH Duty Manager is responsible for declaring a Major Incident.

Section 9 of this document specifies the roles and responsibilities during a major incident. The Major
Incident Manager, see section 9.2, is referred to the Manage Major Incident Procedure and must
endeavour throughout the life of a major incident to adhere to the principles of that procedure.

the service, together with any changes. Service Management will track all actions to resolution. Third
party actions will be reviewed at Service Review meetings.

Itis important that the number of branches impacted and the duration of the Major Incident is agreed at
the Major Incident Review. This information is required to calculate the impact on Branch and Counter
Availability and any associated Liquidated Damages (LD) liabilities

7.1 Calculating potential LD liability for Major Incidents

Major Incidents which qualify as Failure Events are detailed in the Branch Network Service Description
(SVM/SDM/SD0011). A Failure Event is defined in this document as an event or series of connected
events which causes one or more Counter Positions to be deemed to be Unavailable due to a Network
Wide Failure or a Local Failure. Ongoing failures will be deemed to be part of such a Failure Event until
the Failure Event is closed in accordance with the Incident closure and Major Incident Review process as
detailed in section 7.0.

For a Failure Event the Incident Closure & Major Incident Review Process will require Atos and Fujitsu to
agree the number of branches and counter positions affected and the duration of the outage (rounded to
the nearest 30 minutes as detailed in the Network Wide Rounding Table).

8.2 Role of the Major Incident Manager

Major Incident Manager (MIM). This will by default be either the Day Time Duty Manager or OOH Duty
Manager (hours shown in 10.3). However a separate member of the Service Management team may be
appointed as the MIM depending on the situation. The primary role of the MIM in a Major Incident is to
facilitate the management of the Incident through investigation and diagnosis to resolution, with the aim
of making the process as efficient and effective as possible. Upon determining that a Major Incident has
been called, a request for a Technical Recovery Manager (TRM) will be made to the appropriate POA
Tower lead who will appoint one of his team to be the TRM. The Major Incident Manager acts as the
central point for communication and non-technical information flow, allowing the TRM to focus on the
technical situation and the resolution of the Incident. The Major Incident Manager is also responsible for
creating and maintaining all the associated documentation. For the process to be effective, all updates
and information regarding the incident must be fed to the MIM to update the timelines and report.

The Major Incident Manager:
e Calls and chairs the Technical Bridge

e Has responsibility for creating the Major Incident Report, using the template defined in section
10.1 and ensuring that the applicable information is captured.

e Records the Technical Bridge attendees names so they can be documented in the Major Incident
Report.

e Identifies Business and Service impact though discussions with the users, the Atos Service Desk
and the MAC team — providing this input into the Tech Bridge.

e Distributes the Technical Bridge actions provided by the TRM (if appropriate).

e In conjunction with the TRM considers if escalation into the Corporate Alert process is desirable
and recommends this when required, see section 7.8 above.

« Assists with communication internally within the POA
¢ Track time lines

e Along with the POA Problem Manager, ensures that the TRM provides regular updates on any
longer term corrective actions.

e Following the resolution of the Incident, schedules and chairs the PIR

the event of no pre-determined recovery options, suggest and evaluate potential recovery options to
resolve the Incident.

The technical teams should not be contacted by any party other than the Technical Recovery Manager.

The Technical Teams / SMC/ MAC team & Third Parties should send an attendee to the Tech Bridge and
the associated Major Incident Review meeting. Where attendance on the Tech Bridge is not possible, a
suitable alternative resource should attend. If neither is possible then a full update MUST be provided to
the TRM to ensure that the Bridge can be updated.
