I appreciate the need to expedite cases. The cost of obtaining data ,statements is very expense which simply results
from Post offices contractual obligations to fujitsu and also legal, compliance and budgetary obligations puts further
restraints on obtaining such data from fujitsu .Therefore it: is very important due process is strictly followed. I need to be
notified if anything is required from fujitsu.

T-1- ank you Rachael, the important thing is that we put the strongest case back and Gareth is the man, just a matter of

Dear Gareth and James

Apologies if I have approached this in an uncoventional way. As I provided a list of cases, rather than approach each
individual investigator for each case, to then pose the same question to you I thought it would save both time and
duplication of the same question. I apologise if this is incorrect. In the normal circumstances I would normal ly ask the
investigator to liaise with Fujitisu, and assure you that this is what I will do in the future.

In response to your email Gareth, I do intend to use the report that you have already provided. It doesn't matter that you
have not mentioned a specific case in your report, as there has not been any specific criticisms raised by any of the
defendants provided in my list of cases. It would be a different scenario if there had been specific criticisms made, as
your report would have to respond to that particular issue.

Although I intend to use the same report that you have provided, it would not be appropriate or right of me to serve your
report without consulting you and seeking your permission first. Furthermore, your signature is required for each copy of
the report that is served in each case.

As I mentioned in my earlier email, I do not anticipate that you will be required to give evidence in each case, as a number
of cases will probably not even reach trial stage.

What I propose to do is serve your statement on each defence solicitor so that the issue of Horizon is addressed. That
will then place the onus on the Defence to specify what if anything, they say, is wrong with the Horizon system. I do not
think they wi ll be able to do this, but they still have the opportunity if they want a trial, to call you to give evidence.

This is why it is important for you to consider the case summaries that I have provided so that you are fami liar with each
case. If you are happy to serve your statement, please could you email me a signed and dated (with preferably today's
date) identical copy of your report so that I can serve it on each defence solicitor. Could you also send me 5 copies of
original signed statements so that they can be kept on each file, as the court can ask to see the originals.

In regards to commercial cover, the central funds do provide funding for experts giving evidence in trials. The reason that
central funds provide the cover is to ensure that the witnesses that are required to attend are reimbursed for their time and
reasonsable expenses. If they didn't do this, it would discourage witnesses to give evidence, and cases would never be
able to progress. I wi ll find out what the rates are and email you a copy of the form once I have obtained one from the
court's legal advisor.

I hope this assists. I welcome any guidance on the process between ourselves, POL and Fujitsu, but recognise, and think
that I would normally liaise with the investigator in a particular case.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you need any further information

Kind regards

Rachael

Rachel,

I am concerned at the engagement approach being taken here, we are fully on board to support but all approaches must:
come through Post Office by the correct change process.

If this needs clarifying, please let me know and we can steer you to the right people.

Rachel,

Can't you use the report I have already sent you? There is no mention of the case on the report.

You should really be addressing such requests through Post Office Ltd rather than directly to myself.

As far as_I .k how -er . i•s no commercial cover in place for me to spend any time on such activities (and that includes the
case of Anonymity Order

Dear Gareth

Re: Horizon expert report

As you may already be aware, your expert report detailing the reliability of the Horizon system has
been served as evidence in a number of Post Office cases that are at various stages of the court
process, most of which are listed for trial in the early part of next year.

It should be noted that to date, most, if not all cases raising the Horizon system as an issue, have been
unable/not willing to particularise what specific issues that they may have with the system, and how
that shapes the nature of their defence.

As we already have your detailed report, I would like to serve it in each case listed below. All of the
following cases have raised issues with the reliability of the Horizon system:

1..     Jamie Dixon          Trial date - TBC
2.      Khayyam Ishaq       25th Feb 2013 trial at Bradford Crown Court
3.      Angela Sefton & Anne Neild      21st Jan 2013 trial at Liverpool Crown Court
4.      Anonymity Order      14th Jan 2013 trial at Peterborough Crown Court
5.      Kim Wylie           17th December 2012 trial at Newcastle Crown Court
6.      Grant Allen          10th December 2012 for PCMH at Chester Crown Court




                                                                                                                   POL-0086349
                                                                                                                                                         POL00089374
                                                                                                                                                     POL00089374




Your expert report has already been served in thAfl0flYmitYOrderL I would like to serve your
report in the remaining cases and have attached a case summary of each case listed above so that you
may familiarise yourself with the facts of each case.

I would like to stress that I do not anticipate that all of the above cases will reach trial stage. Please
could you read the case summaries attached, and send 5 original signed and dated copies of your
report to me as soon as possible.

I am conscious that there are a couple of cases coming up in December. In order for m.e to serve your
report in time, please could you either send the copies of your reports via special delivery and/or as
an email attachment.

If you have any queries please do not hesitate to contact m.e

Kind regards
