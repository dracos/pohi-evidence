in the above mentioned KEL. Second is absence of equal but opposite [i.e. settlement] lines. See PCO152014 for a similar

Problem and now problem was resolved.

Following the investigation shown in PC0152014 I analysed TPS_POL_FS_Summaries_Incomp where article_id='USD".

I found seven rows.

inree rows had Mode=RISP with total value=£-1940.64.

"Two rows had Mode-ROSP with total value=£2319.06.

Whe difference between these two figures is £378.42 but the total non-zero value for this branch is £989.96 so I have not
found the proper exception.

[Start of Response]

Using the ViewDBInfo tool ("virtual Martin") I found that session 44-382137-1-122871-1 had a net balance of £989.96 so this is
clearly the one I want.

This session involved ProductNo:5132 (Canada Dollar) £8.40, ProductNo:5128 (Euro) £282.64, ProductNo:5238 (Poland New Zloty)
£136.11 and ProductNo:5129 (USA Dollar) £562.81. There was also, in the afternoon, a reversal for the Canada Dollar currency.
ihe first four of these have a total value of £989.96. There was no settlement message written - hence the non-zero sum.

I will assume that the settlement was in cash - ProductNo:1.

This maps to ArticleID="Prcs'.

PS POL FS Summaries Incomp has one row where Article id='PICS' and its value is £-1086.89. I think I need to reduce this by
£989.96 giving £-2076.85

ion noted earlier has three currencies sold with <Mode:SC> but no corresponding settlement line. I proposed adding cash
ico the summaries incomplete table to make it sum to zero.

Cheryl said it is easier to sort out the aftereffects if I adjust the three currencies instead. She is investigating further.

ProductNo:5132 maps to Article ID='CAD'. This article has six rows in summaries incomplete: three have Mode:RISP with values
36.51, -72.27 and -8.40. Two have Mode:ROSP and values 72.27 and 72.27. The final one has Mode:SC and value £0.00.

After discussion with Cheryl and David I think the situation was this:-

1) The session at 11:52 had four Mode:SC transactions for different currencies. Each one of these messages was missing
andatory fields so the harvester rejected them. These messages added up to £989.96.

) The harvester rejections caused the whole day's transactions to go to the incomplete summaries table - without the four
messages rejected by the harvester.

5) The session at 11:52 was missing its settlement message. Its value would have been £-989.96.

M) The result so far is that the summaries incomplete table is short of five messages but its value totals zero.

5) Catherine used the TRT to repair four messa
6) These four messages were sent to POLMIS in file W_049800.

7) The same four messages were now added to the summaries incomplete table so that now has a sum of £989.96. This will now not
0 to POLFS.

Looking at the summaries incomplete table I see 40 rows inserted on 18-Feb and 4 rows inserted on 19-Feb.

ether comment :

3s I reported at 11:42 on 20-Feb, the Canada Dollar transaction of £8.40 was reversed later in the day. Therefore my point (4)
f 16:02 on 20-Feb was wrong. The total values in the incomplete summaries table was £8.40.

{I tried to contact the PM (who has raised 2 calls but been sent to the NBSC) to say it was a system problem. Not available
funtil tomorrow, The branch has a loss of just under £1000.

This is even more complicated than described above. The set of SC transactions was almost certainly written when a s
reversal (RISP) was initiated (via a barcode scan) before thé
set

nd pouch
first was complete. Instead of writing the set of RISP messages,
tled to the ‘currency in pouches’, it wrote a set of badly formed SC messages with no settlement at all.

hese had the sign on the Pgty attribute opposite to the sign on the SaleValue (so the stock quantity was reduced but the
tock value increased). When they balanced on 19th Feb, the quantity was corrected via a DDN (and converted to a cash loss) and
there was a large revaluation up. This data has already been fed into POLFS.

‘Whe branch rolled over on 4th March, with the expected R&P mismatch but not the gain they should have had. Further
investigation found that the clerk had declared currency to match the system figures and not actually the currency on hand.
POL contacted the manager and on 5th March they did another balance with the correct declarations. They currently have a net
jgain of £10.85.

[POL agreed to SSC taking corrective measures by inserting messages which caused an equal but opposite effect. Office produced a
IBT statement on 11-03-2009 which confirm all is right again i.e. no R&Ps mismatch. There should be no further problems
aresulting from these corrective actions. Please see the attached emails for the contacts in POL who agreed to this work to be
