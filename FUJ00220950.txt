John, I uploaded the KELs to WBD’s site and let Pete know I’d done it, but it sounds like maybe he hasn’t told them, so
they are checking — Amy Prime asking “Please could you confirm if this contains all historic and current KEL entries?”

The answer presumably is yes, and am I OK to repeat the info you gave to Pete below as the answer to Amy?

All HORIZON KELs are now obsolete, otherwise they would have been migrated to HNG-X kels.

HORIZON KELs will not be as easy to read as we switched mark-up formatting between the releases.

The KEL status will be either Authorised or Deactivated.

Thank you, we have safely received the documents.

There is also a file named "KELComplete" uploaded to the data room. Please could you confirm if this contains all

Many thanks

Amy,
I have now uploaded to the repository the documents as listed on the attachment.

Those listed on sheet DES APP HLD have been uploaded to the HNG-X folder, noting that those with WD in column are
no longer current for the current HNG-X solution and have been withdrawn.
Those listed on sheet TD ARC are in the Horizon folder.

Please let me know if you find any issues with any of the files, although I believe that they are all straightforward
Word documents and should present no problems.
