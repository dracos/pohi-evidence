Hi Natalie,
We don’t have anything in our records. If you are able to provide the link from Google, we’ll do some further digging.

Hi Ben

It looks like there have been a couple of FOls from an Andrew Whyte before — we last responded to one in March (this
is info from Google not internally!)

Mark U, do we have any further information on him?
Best wishes

Mark / All
Further to my email below, I have had a quick response from the lawyers who support on Sparrow (as I wanted their
views regarding the comments that are on website).

Andy Parsons has noted that the website owner is a Andrew Whyte — Is this name familiar to anyone at POL? It could
be a fictitious name but may be worthwhile finding out.

Andy has advised that the sections of the website that relate to the Horizon litigation are a repetition of statements
we've seen before. Although they are defamatory in parts, he would advise against asserting any claim as that could
be twisted as acting oppressively in the Group Litigation.

The other sections of the website (relating to branch closures and financial issues) need to be reviewed by POL to
highlight exactly what statements are untrue. If there is plainly untrue material in here, external lawyers could

produce a "cease and desist" letter (as set out below).

Andy’s sense however is to leave this (particularly from the Group Litigation perspective). According to the website
hit counter, only 1500 people have visited the website and there are only 2 followers on Twitter.

Hope that helps. Around to discuss now if you are about?

Kind regards

Hi Mark

Some initial comments:

e Defamation as you'll know is the publication of untrue material about a party which damages the reputation of
that party. Post Office can of course be libelled as a corporate victim and Sally Bercow learned a heavy lesson
of making untrue statements on Twitter; see here:
https:/Awww.thequardian.com/politics/2013/may/24/sally-bercow-tweet-libelled-lord-mcalpine

e There are various defences to a defamation claim, including that the material published is "fair comment on a
matter of public interest". POL's modernisation programme is a matter of public interest, so some of the
material will inevitably fall into that category. That said, statements of purported fact which are untrue cannot
be comments or opinions, and are defamatory if damage to POL's reputation is the consequence.

e Wecan send suitable letters to whoever is behind the Twitter account and website and to any ISP. The letters
could, of course, threaten litigation but care needs to be taken as to whether to do so given the need to follow
through on the threat if no action is taken in response to it. Libel proceedings are costly and would run the risk
of POL having in effect to justify its position on its modernisation strategy in a very public forum, which may
be undesirable.

e In terms of cost estimates for external lawyers, considering the material in detail, liaising with us, drafting
letters, and sending them off would involve fees in the region of £2500 plus VAT. They may subsequently
involve Counsel with preparing and issuing proceedings and we can of course get estimates for that and would
put our fees at a further £3000-5000 plus VAT as a minimum.

I’m in back to back meetings today and on leave for the rest of the week but can do a call now if that helps (though we
are on the L300 call) but I hope the above helps.

Kind regards

Hi Mark

Websites like these are difficult to get down. There may be arguments about the content being defamatory or misuse
of trade mark etc. Ultimately, we may need to make an application to a Court.

Is there any branding budget for brand protection (for matters like these or trade mark infringement etc)?

Kind regards

Thank you Darren

I would like get a legal opinion on any action we could take.As the content is clearly defamatory I am
not keen on it being a publicly available website.

Copying Ben in first instance. Please can you advise?

Subject Post Office Facts Twitter Account
Morning all,

https://twitter.com/PostOfficeFacts

Bit of a round robin email, but writing to make all aware of the above account, which is sharing
internal information.

As we know, this isn’t the first time we’ve had such an account set-up, and historically - the activity
from these accounts dwindles after a week or so. Also has very few followers at the moment.

http://postofficetruth.co.uk/

However for this, I can see that a website has also been created, which suggests there’s an intention
by the creator to make more of a ‘thing’ of this — given the effort that would have gone into creating
the website in the first place.
