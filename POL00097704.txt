Alice

An update on what has happened today.

Susan and I had a meeting with Ron and lan from 2" Sight this afternoon and they are coming in to meet Paula
tomorrow at 15.00(I have offered to Paula that I could attend with her, but that will mean someone else
minuting the ARC — I can sort that tomorrow)

e At the meeting this afternoon 2™ Sight were surprised that James now felt there was harder evidence against
the system. They used the phrases; no evidence of widespread systemic failure; the number of cases we are
seeing is small; the pattern aligns with the themes which are already in the public domain.

e They assured Susan and I that they intend to make it very clear on Monday that they have been ‘consolidating
and distilling allegations and that the Post Office have not had the opportunity to respond’

¢ Some of the evidence is plausible but is as yet untested.

e They are nervous about Monday, especially as it now emerges that Shoosmiths are attending the meeting. They
know that loose language will be very unhelpful, and realise that they may end up in the press, which will not
help the investigation.

e Simon is pulling together the facts for your letter to James and I have discussed with Mark , Paula also suggests
that Martin Edwards would be a good person to input. So we will pull this together tomorrow.

Hope that is helpful.

Paula or I will update you after out meeting with 2"¢ Sight tomorrow
Thanks

Alwen
