                                           Subject: Re: Fw: Challenges to Horizon'

     Dave,
     If it is thought that there is a difficulty with Horizon then clearly the action set out in your memo is not
     only needed but is imperative. The consequence however will be that to commence or continue to
     proceed with any criminal proceedings will be inappropriate. My understanding is that the integrity of
    :Horizon data is sound and it is as a result of this that persistent challenges that have been made in
     court have always failed. These challenges are not new and have been with us since the inception of
     Horizon as it has always been the only way that Defendants are left to challenge our evidence when
     they have stolen money or where they need to show that our figures are not correct.

    What is being suggested is that an internal investigation is conducted. Such an investigation will be
    disclosable as undermining evidence on the defence in the cases proceeding through the criminal
    courts. Inevitably the defence will argue that if we are carrying out an investigation we clearly do not
    have confidence in Horizon and therefore to continue to prosecute will be an abuse of the criminal
®   process. Alternatively we could be asked to stay the proceedings pending the outcome of the
    investigation, if this were to be adopted the resultant adverse publicity could lead to massive
    difficulties for POL as it would be seen by the press and media to vindicate the current challenges.
    The potential impact however is much wider for POL in that every office in the country will be seen to
    be operating a compromised system with untold damage to the Business. Our only real alternative to
    avoid the adverse publicity will be to offer no evidence on each of our criminal cases. This should
    mitigate some adverse publicity but is not a total guarantee.

    To continue prosecuting alleged offenders knowing that there is an ongoing investigation to determine
    the veracity of Horizon could also be detrimental to the reputation of my team. If we were to secure
    convictions In the knowledge that there was an investigation, where the investigation established a
    difficulty with the system we would be open to criticism and appeal to the Court of Appeal. The Court
    of Appeal will inevitably be highly critical of any prosecutor's decision to proceed against Defendant's
    in the knowledge that there could be an issue with the evidence.

    What we really need to do is impress on Fujitsu the importance of fully cooperating in the provision of
    technical expertise and witness statements to support the criminal and civil litigation now and in the
    future.

    Given the nature of the discussions that took palce on the 26/2 I am staggered that I was not invited to
    take part in the conference.

                                      Subject: Challenges to Horizon

All,
following our conference call today, below is a brief summary of the agreed key activities to progress
the next steps in relation to the above piece of work:

1) AH & MT to provide SL/DK with information on past and present cases with reference to the Horizon
Challenges (Criminal & Civil cases).
(*Note: I have asked the fraud team to review approx. past 2-3 years casefile although these
challenges are of a more recent nature).

2) Information Security (SL &DK) to conduct initial investigations and provide Terms of Reference
outlining remit and requirements to carry out full investigation (inc. resource, timescales and any
associated ancillary costs).
(N.B. agreement by all that with DK and our 'banking consultant' (Paul Hallidan), we have far more
expertise and knowledge than anyone else is likely to produce for this initial piece of work).

3) Subject to agreement of 2 above, conduct full investigations into integrity issues, with conclusions/
report provided. Once investigated and conclusions drawn, gain external verification to give a level of'
external gravitas' to the response to these challenges. (Recommend Ernst & Young as most suitable
partner to complete this...TBA).

Additional:
AP: DP to continue with investigation into Alresford (outstanding debt) case and feed into MT & wider
review.

    AP: DP to forward details to all on previous investigations conducted on 2 x Horizon challenge cases.
    Note: Ensure that any response formulated includes an ongoing review to any developments/Changes
    to Horizon, that in turn will support legal challenges in the future. (DK commented that there were
    already systems in place that would verify and support this).

     Thanks,

     We have additional difficulties in relation to challenges to Horizon. Today i have been made aware of
     a prosecution being conducted by the CPS where Horizon is being challenged. The case may have
     already been identified by you. The difficulty however will be our lack of control over any case that is
     not being prosecuted by my team.

    Essentially it means that we would wish to examine that the Security controls that we have specified
    for Horizon and those systems with which it interfaces are indeed in place and working correctly.

        1
        As was discussed on the conference call and taking into account Rob's comments, to confirm that
        what we are looking at is a 'general' due diligence exercise on the integrity of Horizon, to confirm our
        belief in the robustness of the system and thus rebut any challenges.

        The Information Security team have looked at the information that has been forwarded to them, re the
        above and it seems that the issues raised are mainly around procedural items and about 'Accounting'
        reconciliation.

        To enable us to examine the Integrity of Horizon from an Information Security perspective we need
        input from a number of areas.

         1  A decription of the accounting process from the business perspective, including the interfaces
            between Horizon and POUFS and the process by which 'error notices' are generated.
         2. The identity of all the offices making allegations, together with a list of loss declarations from those
            offices.
         3. A report from Service Delivery of all the problems they have received through the Live Service
            Desk, from the offices in 2 above.

0       Rod, could you please arrange for someone to provide item 1
        Andy, item 2
        Information Security will provide item 3 once we have the complete list of offices.

        Once we have that information, I can then put together a plan of how we will examine the system
        'integrity' of Horizon and the resource required to complete it.

    I'm aware of two ongoing cases at West Byfleet (John Longman) & Orford Rd ? (Lisa Allen) and
    also some historical cases (which are included on the attachment below), but as Fl, we wouldn't
    have Horizon disputed cases other than those reported by the Investigator's, who will have far more
    details on the issues than us.

    I've attached an article from an IT magazine which may have bought this issue to the fore in the 1st
    place and which may be of interest to Ian.

    Jason/Graham,

    Andy called me and asked whether you guys, (Graham, if FIU have any cases in dispute/new issues
    that could affect your case) could put together some stats on these cases, where the accused's
    defence was/is that the Horizon data is unreliable for any amount of reasons given by the accused .

    This should be sent to lain within the next few days. lain will need as much infomation as possible.

    Rob

    Thanks for you time earlier.

    As discussed, I can confirm that we are in no way questioning/investigating the financial integrity of
    Horizon, or of the accounting system as a whole. The Information Security review is to look at the
    ways in which messages are sent at a system level and whether there are any additional measures we
    could put in place to make it easier to show message integrity at that level (below that of any
    reconciliation or accounting) and thus improve the statements/evidence available.

    The intention is to look at the current and past challenges to identify where common claims are being
    made enabling the production/adaptation of the statements produced in support of the system
    information.

    Thanks

    All,

    As was discussed on the conference call and taking into account Rob's comments, to confirm that
    what we are looking at is a 'general' due diligence exercise on the integrity of Horizon, to confirm our
    belief in the robustness of the system and thus rebutt any challenges.

    The Information Security team have looked at the information that has been forwarded to them, re the
    above and it seems that the issues raised are mainly around procedural items and about 'Accounting'
    reconciliation.

    To enable us to examine the Integrity of Horizon from an Information Security perspective we need
    input from a number of areas.

     1. A decription of the accounting process from the business perspective, including the interfaces
        between Horizon and POUFS and the process by which 'error notices' are generated.
     2. The identity of all the offices making allegations, together with a list of loss declarations from those
        offices.
     3. A report from Service Delivery of all the problems they have received through the Live Service
        Desk, from the offices in 2 above.

    Rod, could you please arrange for someone to provide item 1
    Andy, item 2
    Information Security will provide item 3 once we have the complete list of offices.

    Once we have that information, I can then put together a plan of how we will examine the system
    'integrity' of Horizon and the resource required to complete it.

    Yours
    Sue.

        I'm aware of two ongoing cases at West Byfleet (John Longman) & Orford Rd ? (Lisa Allen) and
        also some historical cases (which are included on the attachment below), but as FI's, we wouldn't
        have Horizon disputed cases other than those reported by the Investigator's, who will have far more
        details on the issues than us.

        I've attached an article from an IT magazine which may have bought this issue to the fore in the 1st
        place and which may be ofinterest to Ian.

     Jason/Graham,

     Andy called me and asked whether you guys, (Graham, if FIU have any cases in dispute/new issues
     that could affect your case) could put together some stats on these cases, where the accused's
     defence was/is that the Horizon data is unreliable for any amount of reasons given by the accused

     This should be sent to lain within the next few days. lain will need as much infomation as possible.

      As was discussed on the conference call and taking into account Rob's comments, to confirm that
      what we are looking at is a 'general' due diligence exercise on the integrity of Horizon, to confirm our
      belief in the robustness of the system and thus rebutt any challenges.

      The Information Security team have looked at the information that has been forwarded to them, re the
      above and it seems that the issues raised are mainly around procedural items and about'Accounting'
      reconciliation.

      To enable us to examine the Integrity of Horizon from an Information Security perspective we need
      input from a number of areas.

L~I   1. A decription of the accounting process from the business perspective, including the interfaces
         between Horizon and POUFS and the process by which 'error notices' are generated.
      2. The identity of all the offices making allegations, together with a list of loss declarations from those
         offices.
      3. A report from Service Delivery of all the problems they have received through the Live Service
         Desk, from the offices in 2 above.

      Rod, could you please arrange for someone to provide item 1
      Andy, item 2
      Information Security will provide item 3 once we have the complete list of offices.

      Once we have that information, I can then put together a plan of how we will examine the system
      'integrity' of Horizon and the resource required to complete it.

      Yours
      Sue.

     All,
     further to our discussion earlier today, additional information in the attached pdf article below. As part
     of the wider review It may well be worthwhile understanding the 'outcome' of each of the case studies
     referenced, where applicable (i.e. criminal/civil) and that may assist in our review.
     Cheers,

     I'm aware of two ongoing cases at West Byfleet (John Longman) & Orford Rd ? (Lisa Allen) and
     also some historical cases (which are included on the attachment below), but as F1's, we wouldn't
41   have Horizon disputed cases other than those reported by the Investigator's, who will have far more
     details on the issues than us.

     I've attached an article from an IT magazine which may have bought this issue to the fore in the let
     place and which may be of interest to Ian.
