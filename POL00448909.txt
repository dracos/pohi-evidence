Referral Application to Independent
Pecuniary Compensation Assessment Panel

Guidance for completion of the application form — please read this
information carefully before completing the form

Please only complete one application form. This will assist the Independent Pecuniary Compensation
Assessment Panel (‘the Panel’) in reviewing your claim, or for legally represented individuals, your
client’s claim. If you are not legally represented, Post Office Limited (‘Post Office’) urge you to seek
independent legal advice, the reasonable costs of which will be met by Post Office.

The Principles underlying offers of Pecuniary Compensation (‘the Principles’), the Pecuniary
Compensation Assessment Process (‘the Process’) and the Terms of Reference for the Independent
Pecuniary Compensation Assessment Panel (‘the Terms of Reference’) govern referrals. If copies of
these documents are required, please contact Post Office’s legal representatives.

If the application relates to multiple heads of loss, these should be included in the same form. A
separate document may be appended to this form for submission of relevant supporting material and
information, to assist the Panel in properly considering the application. Failing to provide such
information with the application may result in unnecessary delays. You may be contacted if any
additional information is required by the Panel to progress the application.

Applications and other communications should be sent to the clerk to Sir Gary Hickinbottom, Chair of
the Panel, by email to POPanelEnquirie:

If you are not legally represented, and you do not have an email address yourself, then a family
member or friend is welcome to email on your behalf. In order to minimise any potential delays with
processing applications, sending the application by email is preferred. However, if email is not
possible then the application may alternatively be sent by post to the clerk to Sir Gary Hickinbottom:
Chris Jones, 39 Essex Chambers, 81 Chancery Lane, London WC2A 1DD.
