1 Purpose and Scope

The purpose of this document is to define the security incident management policy for Royal Mail Group
Account consistent with IS27001, contractual commitments and relevant POL requirements as
expressed in CISP. [Ref 16]

The scope of this policy includes all security domains and business operations of the Post Office counter
automation system (The Service), related processes and procedures.

This policy is a derivative policy and supports the RMGA Information Security Master Policy which is in
turn subordinate to Fujitsu Services corporate Information Services policy where they are applied to
operational areas provided from FS Core.

1.1 Objectives

The objectives of this policy are:

To ensure information security events and weaknesses associated with RMGA information
systems are communicated in a manner allowing timely corrective action to be taken.

To ensure a consistent and effective approach is applied to the management of information
security incidents.

2 Policy Statement.

1

Information security events should be reported through appropriate management channels
as quickly as possible.

All employees, contractors and third party users of information systems and services should
be required to note and report any observed or suspected security weaknesses in systems
or services.

3. Management responsi ies and procedures should be established to ensure a quick,
effective, and orderly response to information security Incidents.

4. There should be mechanisms in place to enable the types, volumes, and costs of
information security Incidents to be quantified and monitored.

5. Where a follow-up action against a person or organization after an information security
Incident involves legal action (either civil or criminal), evidence should be collected,
retained, and presented to conform to the rules for evidence laid down in the relevant
jurisdiction(s).

Information Security Management Policy Set

FUJITSU Security Incident Management

Unclassified

3. RMGA Incident Management

An information security Incident is: "an adverse event or series of events that compromises the
confidentiality, integrity or availability of RMGA information or information technology assets, having an
adverse impact on Fujitsu Services reputation, brand, performance or ability to meet its regulatory or
legal obligations." This will also extend to include assets entrusted to Fujitsu including data belonging to
Post Office Ltd, its clients and its customers.

Incidents can be categorised in many ways, they can occur alone or in combination with other Incident
categories and can vary significantly in severity and impact. It is important that all Incidents are
recognised and acted upon.

For the purpose of illustrating the impact of Incidents two levels of severity have been defined (Note: in
practice the assessment may be less straightforward):

A MINOR Incident will normally have limited and localised impact and be confined to one domain,
resulting in one or more of the following:

e Loss or unauthorised disclosure of internal or sensitive material leading to minor exposure,
or minor damage of reputation

e Loss of integrity within the system application or data, leading minimal damage of
reputation; minimal loss of customer / supplier / stakeholder confidence; negligible cost of
recovery

e Loss of service availability within the domain, leading to reduced ability to conduct business
as usual; negligible loss of revenue; minimal loss of customer / supplier / stakeholder
confidence; negligible cost of recovery

A MAJOR Incident will have a significant impact on The Service resulting in one of more of the
following:

e Loss or unauthorised disclosure of confidential or strictly confidential material, leading to
brand or reputation damage; legal action by employees, clients, customers, partners or other
external parties

e Loss of integrity of the applications or data, leading to brand or reputation damage; loss of
customer / supplier / client confidence; cost of recovery

« Loss of service availability for applications or communications networks, leading to an
inability to conduct business as usual; loss of revenue; loss of customer / supplier / client
confidence; cost of recovery

3.1 Reporting information security events

A formal information security event reporting procedure must be established, which includes an Incident
response and escalation procedure, setting out the action to be taken on receipt of a report of an
information security event. This will normally result in a call to the RMGA Service Desk.

All Incidents reported to the Service Desk will be logged and given a reference and, even if classified as
minor, must be forwarded to the RMGA Security Manager to determine if there is a security Impact.

All RMGA Staff should be made aware of their responsibility to report any information security events as
quickly as possible to their line manager and onwards to the RMGA Security Manager. They should also
be aware of the procedure for reporting information security events and the point of contact.

3.2 Reporting security weaknesses

If RMGA Staff identify or suspect that a security weakness exists anywhere in the RMGA system then
they must report these matters either to their line manager or directly to RMGA Business Security
Manager as quickly as possible in order to prevent information security Incidents.

Information Security Management Policy Set

FUJITSU Security Incident Management

Unclassified

The reporting mechanism should be as easy, accessible, and available as possible.

All RMGA staff must be aware that they should not, in any circumstances, attempt to prove a suspected
weakness themselves. If such a course of action resulted in a security Incident then it would be treated
as a disciplinary issue.

3.3 Management of information security Incidents and improvements

Whenever an Incident is identified which presents a serious threat to conduct normal business it should
be contained and isolated as quickly as possible. This will mean Platforms that appear to have suffered
virus attack or other malicious code attack need to be quarantined immediately to prevent further
spread. It may also be necessary to isolate network connections that appear to be the source for Denial
of Service threats or where they have been subjected to suspected hacking attack.

In addition to reporting of information security events and weaknesses, the monitoring of systems, alerts,
and vulnerabilities should be used to detect information security Incidents.

Procedures must be established to handle different types of information security Incident, including:
« information system failures and loss of service;
* malicious code;
* denial of service;
* errors resulting from incomplete or inaccurate business data;
«breaches of confidentiality and integrity;
e misuse of information systems;
The procedures must also cover:
« analysis and identification of the cause of the Incident;
* containment;
e planning and implementation of corrective action to prevent recurrence, if necessary;
* communication with those affected by or involved with recovery from the Incident;
reporting the action to the appropriate authority;
Audit trails and similar evidence must be collected and secured, as appropriate, for:
e — internal problem analysis;

e use as forensic evidence in relation to a potential breach of contract or regulatory
requirement or in the event of civil or criminal proceedings, e.g. under computer misuse or
data protection legislation;

* negotiating for compensation from software and service suppliers;

Any action to recover from security breaches and correct system failures should be carefully and
formally controlled; the procedures should ensure that:

e only clearly identified and authorized personnel are allowed access to live systems and data
in line with the access controls policy and access guidelines [Ref:SVM/SVM/POL/0027];

e all emergency actions taken are documented in detail;

* emergency action is reported to operational management and reviewed in an orderly
manner;

«the integrity of business systems and controls is restored with minimal delay.

The objectives for information security Incident management must be agreed by the RMGA Business
Security Manager and the priority criteria for Incident management defined. Line mangers must ensure

that those responsible for information security Incident management understand the RMGA’s priorities
for handling information security Incidents.

3.4 Learning from information security Incidents

There must be mechanisms in place to enable the types, volumes, and costs of information security
Incidents to be quantified and monitored.

The information gained from the evaluation of information security Incidents should be used to identify
recurring or high impact Incidents.

The RMGA Security Team must carry out a check of all security Incidents investigations at at least six
monthly intervals and create a summary report highlighting all Incidents to the POL Head of Information
Security. The report must also highlight any trends or weaknesses which may need to be raised at future
Security Forums.

3.5 Collection of evidence

Should it be considered necessary the Incident might be passed to an external Investigator or forensics
team, who will ensure that any data required for evidential purposes is captured and investigated using a
systematic approach which ensures that an auditable record of evidence is maintained and can be
retrieved

Before undertaking security Incident investigation and computer forensics it is essential that
investigators, whether internal or external, have a thorough understanding of the Rules of Evidence. The
submission of evidence in any type of legal proceedings generally amounts to a significant challenge,
but when computers are involved the problems are intensified. Special knowledge is needed to locate
and collect evidence, and special care is required to preserve and transport evidence. Evidence in
computer crime cases may differ from traditional forms of evidence in as much as most computer
related evidence is intangible and is in the form of electronic pulse or magnetic charge.

In general, the rules for evidence cover:
a) Admissibility of evidence: whether or not the evidence can be used in court;
b) Weight of evidence: the quality and completeness of the evidence.

To achieve admissibility of the evidence, the RMGA must ensure that their information systems comply
with any published standard or code of practice for the production of admissible evidence.

The weight of evidence provided should comply with any applicable requirements. To achieve weight of
evidence, the quality and completeness of the controls used to correctly and consistently protect the
evidence (i.e. process control evidence) throughout the period that the evidence to be recovered was
stored and processed should be demonstrated by a strong evidence trail.

Incident investigation procedures must be developed which ensure that evidence is collected such that it
is admissible and of sufficient weight by keeping original documents, copies of information held on hard
discs, removable media and log files.
