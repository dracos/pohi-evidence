A short guide to the Audit Reporting Tool (ART)

The ART is a Microsoft Excel document which is used to record the results from audits and to
generate reports where required to internal stakeholders and Postmasters. It is used for all four
types of audit:

Full audit —a full physical check of all Post Office assets and comparison with Horizon
derived figures. Reports sent to internal stakeholders and the Postmaster

* Closure audit — At a closure all POL assets are verified and remitted out and this is recorded
on the ART. Report sent to internal stakeholders only.

¢ Post security incident audit (e.g. robbery/burglary) - a full physical check of all Post Office
assets and comparison with Horizon derived figures to determine the loss to be attributed to
the incident. Reports sent to internal stakeholders and the Postmaster

e Transfer audit - a full physical check of all Post Office assets and comparison with Horizon
derived figures which is then agreed by both outgoing and incoming Postmasters.

Prior to an audit taking place the auditor clicks on the “Planning” tab and enters the branch code for
the branch to be audited, details for the branch are pulled from a central database and the branch
details are then populated. Further details are manually entered on the Planning page to include:
date of audit, type of audit, audit leader, other auditors in attendance, if the branch is a Multiple, if
the branch is a Core/Outreach.

At the audit

The ART is populated with figures obtained from various Horizon produced reports such as: last
Branch Trading Statement carried forward figures, remittances in/out during the current Trading
Period, cash/stamps/currency on hand, suspense account entries, sales & receipts and payments
from the office snapshot printed on the day of the audit.

Where there are multiple stock units the ART will collate figures for each stock unit to produce an
overall on hand figure for the branch. Once all the entries have been made the “Results/Snapshot”
tab on the ART will show the audit result which is a comparison between the expected and actual
value and volumes on hand for cash, currency and stock items/stamps.

Full audits and Robbery/Burglary audits require sections A to F to be completed.

The result of the audit is then communicated to the Postmaster and an email address obtained in
order to send a copy of the audit report following the audit. The audit report shows the result and
breaks down where there were discrepancies (if any) i.e. cash shortage, stock surplus etc. The audit
report tab also contains a free text box for the auditor to record any important observations or any

other relevant information.

Once the audit report is written the report is emailed to the Postmaster.

Once audit reports have been sent the ART is uploaded to a central SharePoint site for storage.
