ROYAL MAIL GROUP (POST OFFICE LTD) — CASE REVIEW

R. v Angela Jane Hodgson

Penrith Magistrates Court and Carlisle Crown Court

Offence and Case history

1.

On 17" September 2010 at Carlisle Crown Court, this defendant pleaded guilty
on a basis to one count of Fraud, contrary to section 1 of the Fraud Act 2006.
She was sentenced to 6 months imprisonment suspended for two years with a

150 hour unpaid work requirement.

Ms Hodgson first appeared at Penrith Magistrates Court on the 19 August
2009. The defendant did not attend as she was suffering from depression and
stress. The case was adjourned to 28" September 2009. On that date the
defendant having indicated a not guilty plea, it was adjourned to the 23"
November 2009 for committal. On that date it was further adjourned owing to
legal aid problems to 21* December 2009. The case was adjourned from the
21* December to the 11" January 2010 as relations had broken down between
the defendant and her lawyers as, owing to alcohol issues and mental health
problems she was unable to sort out legal aid. The case was adjourned again to

20" January 2010 on which date it was committed to Carlisle Crown Court.

The PCMH was listed on the 22" February 2010 on which date the defendant
pleaded not guilty and the case was fixed for trial on 26" May 2010. The
PCMH form specifically mentions the reliability of the Horizon system as one
of the issues for the trial. A Defence statement was served on 15" March 2010
which questioned the accuracy of the audit and denied the removal of any cash

by the defendant. On the 24" May the trial date was vacated for the defence to

serve their expert’s report. The case was relisted for mention on the 9" July
2010 and for trial on 21* September 2010. The case next appears to have been
before the court on 16" July 2010. The defendant was apparently refusing to
speak to her solicitors or counsel. The matter was then listed for a “Goodyear”
indication on 7 September 2010 which appears to have been non effective. On

17" September 2010 the defendant was sentenced as above.

4. There is no indication that the defence expert report was served on the

Prosecution who were asking for it as late as 9" August 2010.

Prosecution case

5. The defendant, Angela Jane Hodgson, was during the relevant period,
30/06/2007 — 04/03/2009, a sub postmaster at Kirkoswald Sub Post Office.

6. On 4" March 2009 an audit took place at Kirkoswald Sub Post Office.

7. On the date of the audit the auditor found a total shortage of £17,810.97 made

up as follows:

e £11,055.09 (-) identified as a difference in cash figures
¢ £139.83 (-)identified as a difference in cheque on hand figures
¢ £171.37 (-) identified as a difference in stock figures

e £161.11 (-) identified as a difference in postage stamp figures

8. A further £6,278.57 was identified by Chesterfield as being an outstanding
amount previously settled centrally which brought the total to £17,810.97. (It
seems from the correspondence on the file that the defendant was sentenced on
the shortage in the cash at the time of the audit, namely £11,532.40. This was

the amount ordered in compensation.)

9. Ms Hodgson gave the auditors a cheque for £11,532.40 which was

subsequently returned unpaid.
10. After a certain amount of evasive behaviour by Ms Hodgson interviews were

eventually arranged for the 21* May 2009

11. Ms Hodgson, in her interviews, conducted under the provisions of the Police

and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 and the relevant Codes of Practice, said that:

She had made “big boobs with it not of a criminal nature but I’ve made
lots and lots of mistakes and become very frustrated with it, especially
lots of things that happened like events like it was always going
wrong.”

The £6,278 was about savings stamps. There was obviously a mistake
as no one would have that amount of savings stamps.

The explanation for the deficit on the day of audit was that it was “by
making mistakes.”

She did not have time for additional training due to her nursing job

The figures had always been going wrong.

The helpline was no good as it took too long to get through.

When it was put that she could not be bothered with the Post Office as
it didn’t interest her she replied “correct”.

She stated that, “quite frankly I hated it.”

Asked how she did her balances she said, “I just had a piece of paper a
thing I used to follow to try to get it right and I just used to make
mistakes with it.”

The Officer asked, “Is it that you’ve shoved any old figure into the
system?” to which she replied, “Mm.”

She had never used POL money for anything. She did not use it for the
shop or to pay staff.

She did not know if the declaration of 26" February 2009 was accurate
She didn’t always count the cash.

She had not lost, given away or stolen the £17,000 in the week between
that figure and the audit.

Most of the branch trading statements weren’t accurate because I didn’t
understand how to do the system, you know work it out when there

was things going wrong.

— She had not stolen money and had not made an attempt to hide a
shortage.

— On the declaration that she did on the morning of the audit she did not
notice that she only had £836 rather than £12,346.07. She did not know
that she had inflated the cash.

— She was shown an IOU for £5000. (HD9) She stated that it was for £50

— She denied that the £170 note (HD10) found in the Post Office

paperwork referred to money for cigarettes being paid for by POL cash.

Defence case

12. In interview the defendant denies taking POL money but admits that her book

keeping was chaotic as she didn’t know what she was doing.

13. The defendant served a defence statement which denied taking any POL money
and questioned the audit. The Horizon system was questioned on the PCMH

form and the defence commissioned an expert to investigate this case

14. The guilty plea was entered only a week before the proposed trial date

Discussion

15. This case was dealt with by way of a guilty plea at the eleventh hour before the
trial. Until that time the matter looked like an effective trial. It seems to be
clear from the prosecution file that there was tension between the defendant
and her legal advisors which, reading between the lines, seems to result from
firm advice to plead (The defendant not speaking to counsel and solicitors at

the hearing of 16" July 2010 would seem indicative of this).

16. In this case there was a direct attack on the figures produced from the audit, a
direct challenge to Horizon, criticism made in interview of the helpline and a
firm assertion that she was not properly trained and did not understand the

system. These are all issues dealt with in the Second Sight Interim Report and
POL00294516
POL00294516

it is my view that had we been possessed of that report during the course of

this case we would have made the defence aware of its contents.

17. This defendant may well be hard put to found an appeal against either
conviction or sentence in this case as she all but admitted submitting false
figures in interview and the sentence is hardly manifestly excessive for this type
of case. Nonetheless where a defendant pleads guilty as late in the day as this
one, there is always a concern that the plea was tendered in a spirit of
pragmatism rather than an acceptance of guilt and such a plea might not have
been tendered in this case had the defence had material upon which they could
have mounted an attack on the Prosecution’s figures. It is my view that we
should disclose the Second Sight Interim Report to those who were acting for

Ms Hodgson in order that they can consider and advise upon her options.

Conclusion

18. This is a case in which, had we been possessed of the material at the relevant
time, we would have disclosed to the defence the matters identified in the
Second Sight Interim Report during the trial process. It is my view that we are
still under a duty to make those instructed by Ms Hodgson aware of the

contents of that Report and they should be written to accordingly.
