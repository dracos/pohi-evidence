Horizon Online Migration Non-conformance Process

1. Background

The delivery of Horizon Online is a key business strategy in delivering some of the cost savings
that underpin bringing the business back into profit by 2011. The key dates for delivery of the
Horizon Online rollout will be communicated by the Horizon Online Programme Team

The migration from the existing Horizon software to the new Horizon Online software will require
the branch to undertake a migration process on the system, which involves printing and checking
some basic reports, migrating the branch and then, once migrated, setting up all users with
compliant passwords. It is therefore necessary to have processes in place to deal with branches
that do not migrate on their scheduled date and formalise arrangements between the Horizon
Online project and Network Directorate.

The purpose of this document therefore is to:

1. Outline the Network Directorate approach to dealing with branch non-conformance with regard
to Horizon Online migration.

2. Formalise the arrangements and requirements between the Horizon Online project and Network
Directorate. It has been assumed for the purposes of this document that the Horizon Online
Project will have an Issues Resolution Team (IRT), which will be the first point of
escalation for branches that have not migrated as scheduled.

3. Provision of Management Information required by the Horizon Online Project.

4. Outline resource requirements and costs associated with Network supporting the non-
conformance process.

2. Non-conformance and Training Completion Processes.
This section will be split to cover the two types of potential non-conformance and training
completion. These are as follows:

= Section 2.1 covers the non-conformance related to the router installation

=" Section 2.2 documents the processes to tackle branches that do not migrate on the
prescribed day.

= Section 2.3 details the approach to those branches that do not complete any of the training
modules in advance of migration.

2.1 Router Installation Non-conformance

This section covers the approach to be taken to branch non-conformance during the router
installation rollout. The installation of the router in branch is prerequisite for migration
onto the Horizon Online platform. The rollout is being coordinated between the HOP and Fujitsu
Services to ensure minimised impact on the branch network and that Fujitsu engineering resource
can deliver the installations. Barring the largest branches in the network, where the router
will be installed out of normal branch hours, the installations will take place in branch hours
and will normally not require more than a hour for installation to be completed. Branches will
receive advance contact from the Fujitsu engineer to confirm the date and time window (AM or PM)
of the installation. It is anticipated that due to some of the mitigating actions the numbers of
escalations for router installation non-conformance should be relatively small.

2.1.1 Dimensions of Non-conformance
The following have been identified as the branch non-conformance scenarios that could arise
during the router rollout:

1. Branch refusal to have the router installed.
1.1. Refusal of installation for unconnected reasons (e.g. other grievances with the
business, branch about to transfer etc

POL00034433
POL00034433

HNG_NC_PROCESS-v4.2
Version 4.2 (June 09)

1.2. Refusal of installation on the assigned date (i.e. branch wants to reschedule). This
could be advised when the engineer initially contacts the branch to confirm arrangements or
when the engineer actually arrives on site.

1.3. Refusal due to branch being unhappy about closure and loss of business.

2. Branch cannot be contacted to confirm installation. These should only be escalated in cases
where Fujitsu has attempted contact with the branch on at least three occasions on different
days when the branch is open.

. Recent unplanned closure at the branch.

4. Unable to conduct router installation due to branch system problems.

w

NOTE: 1.2 and 1.3 above will be mitigated against to a certain degree due to the fact that the
branch will initially be offered 2/3 options for installation dates.

2.1.2 Escalation Process

Initial escalation for router installation will, in the vast majority of cases, be from Fujitsu
Services to the HOP Issues Resolution Team, where they have not either not been able to install
a router or have not been able to contact a branch to confirm installation. All escalations into
Network Directorate from the IRT should be done by e-mail on the agreed spreadsheet template
into the Post Office Migration Support Team (POMST) containing the following information:

=" Branch Details (including FAD, Name, Segment, National Multiple, Head of BD, BDM, Tel No.)

= Proposed New Date of Installation (if appropriate)

=" Reason for the escalation

=" Details of conversation(s) already held with branch (including name of person spoken too
and date/time of contact)

= Resolution Date

= Indicate cases where delay to router installation will impact migration date. In some
cases, the router installation could be occurring as little as 2 or 3 days before
migration.

3. Day 3/4 - POMST initial contact with the branch or checking of records dependent on reason for
non-installation. For non-valid refusals a verbal warning will be issued by POMST if the branch
is still unwilling to accept the installation.

4. Day 5/6 - Escalation by POMST to Contracts Advisor or Senior Account Manager

5. Day 9/10 - Contracts Advisor/SAM report back on resolution to POMST

6. Day 10/11 - POMST report back to IRT on branch.

2.2 Migration Non-conformance

This section documents the processes for dealing with any branches that fail to migrate. Fujitsu
will produce daily MI detailing the branches that have failed to migrate on the prescribed date.
The following assumptions have been made with regard to the migration and the MI:

e Any escalations required into Network will have those branches that could not migrate due to
technical reasons stripped out by Fujitsu/IRT.

e In cases where the branch misses the migration date the icon will disappear from the Horizon
system and will have to be scheduled to go back on. The current assumption is that the icon
will not be able to appear any sooner than 5 working days after the initial date, due to the
restrictions of the OBC process. This is the same process each time the branch fails to
migrate and adds greater risk into the process.

e The project has to meet its final migration date as advised by the Horizon Online Progamme.
Having only one branch not migrated means that the old Horizon platform cannot be turned off
and the costs of dual running could be substantial. It is therefore recommended below that
there be flexibility in the process described to reduce the number of steps as the deadline
approaches and, secondly, that there be an exceptions process to deal with those cases that
cause particular issues (e.g. Absentee subpostmasters). The Exceptions Process and the issues
around tail end management are discussed in more detail in Section 2.4 below.

e Section 2.3 outlines that the training plan for branches now included on site migration
support at all branches. This means that a branch’s failure to migrate will most likely arise
either when the branch is contacted by either the IRT or, NBSC or POMST field resource in
advance of the visit, or when the POMST field resource arrives on site and is refused access
or the branch refuses to migrate during the process itself.

2.3 Non-completion of Training
Branches will be advised to complete training prior to migration onto the Horizon Online
platform. It should be noted however that none of the training is mandatory and failure to

HNG_NC_PROCESS-v4.2
Version 4.2 (June 09)

complete will not prevent the branch from migrating onto the new software.The branch will have
the following training options:

e All branches will receive on site migration support onto the new Horizon Online platform; this
will be on the day of migration and will include support with the migration process through to
conclusion and a short introduction to the new software.

e Horizon test and confirmation - All branches will have the facility to do this prior to
migration. Once a branch has migrated the facility to complete this test will not be available

e Online test via website - For any branch that has access to the Internet and wishes to
complete by this method.

The training pack will be sent out to branches 3 weeks prior to their migration dates with the
on-site migration support attending on the scheduled migration date. . Along with the two
interactive tests mentioned above (Horizon and website), this approach should give branches
sufficient initial knowledge to be comfortable operating the new Horizon Online software from
opening on the first day. . This process for training non-completion is based on the following
three assumptions:

e All branches should at least complete the Horizon test and confirmation.

e The Horizon test and confirmation should be completed before the scheduled migration date
and attendance by the Horizon Online Trainer

e Branches that have not completed the Horizon test will not be stopped from migrating or
trading on Horizon Online, but they will be expected to conclude the test within 7 days
of migration.

2.3.1 Actions for Non-completion of Training

POMST will be provided with management information on a daily basis that will show the status of
all branches in the rollout and their current status with regard to the training highlighted
above. POMST field resource will be supplied with this data prior to their visit to the branch

on the scheduled migration date and will check to see if the branch has completed the Horizon
online test. Any branches that have not completed the test will be challenged on the visit and a
commitment sort that they do the test within a week of migration.

2.3.2 Escalation Process
The IRT will receive regular management information updates on what training a branch has
completed. The timeline for branches with regard to training non-completion will be as follows:

e 3 weeks prior to migration following dispatch of training pack - Phonecall from NBSC will be
made to the branch to ensure they are on track for migration; part of this call will be to
remind branches of the need to complete the confirmation on Horizon that they have undertaken
the training.

e 1 week prior to migration - Phonecall from NBSC to branches that have not done any of the
training to remind them to complete it.

* 1 or 2 days prior to scheduled migration date - The POMST field resource checks the management
information to see if the branch they are visiting the following day has completed the Horizon
test. POMST field resource contacts the branch to confirm the appointment and reminds the
branch to complete the Horizon test in cases where they have not already done so.

e Day of scheduled migration —- POMST field resource attends branch to carry out migration
support, and as part of the visit checks to see if the branch has done the Horizon
confirmation training. If the branch has completed the training the POMST field resource
should check the receipts in branch and make a note to state they have seen them. If the
branch has not completed the Horizon Test the POMST field resource should advise the branch
that they must complete a manual copy of the training within 7 days and they will receive a
letter from the Contracts Advisor asking for confirmation that they have done so. The paper
copy of the test should be retained in branch as proof of completion of the test.

e 8 days after scheduled migration date - Network Support Admin will issue a letter to any
branch identified by POMST field resource has not completing Horizon Test on date of
migration. The letter will carry a reply slip for the branch to confirm that they have now

The flowchart embedded below is the high level process showing the interactions between the
three groups involved in dealing with potential migration non-conformance; the Horizon Online
Project IRT, the POMST field resource and the POMST Admin Team The process covers the basic
process with links into the processes to deal with Exceptions (Section 2.4) and Corrective

2.4. Exceptions Process & Tail End Management
There will be a need to set up an exceptions process to deal with those branches that:

e Still fail to conform after being taken through the full non-conformance process detailed
above.

e Are unable to migrate due to valid mitigating circumstances

e Branches unable to migrate for various reasons that have not been anticipated.

e Circumstances prevent migration before the milestone date for all branches to be migrated
(date will be advised by Horizon Online Programme)

It is anticipated that only small numbers of branches should be required to go through the
Exceptions Process (EP) and that responsibility for managing the exceptions will be given to an
Exceptions Manager within Network, who will log, track and crucially bring together any parties
responsible for resolution. The Exceptions Manager responsible for managing the EP will be
notified daily by POMST of any branches that require escalation via e-mail, along with the
details of previous contacts with the branch.

The Manager will then be responsible for managing any branches through to resolution. This will

involve bringing together key stakeholders to ensure that the issues at the branch are resolved.
The Exceptions Manager will have responsibility for ensuring the logging of all escalations and

ensuring that information is transparent to the other key stakeholders involved in the migration
rollout (principally IRT and POMST).

The table below outlines the anticipated stakeholders that would need to be brought into resolve
issues at branches:

necessary the branch

= If no access and migration
is possible before the end of
rollout, the branch will have
to be closed via OBC and re-
rolled.

The Exceptions Manager will also take primary responsibility for dealing with those branches
that fall into the tail end management process. It is currently anticipated that the migrations
schedule allows for a 2-week mop up periodat the end of the migration rollout. This is crucial,
as any branches remaining during this period will have to be managed closely, as the business
cannot afford to have any branches on the current Horizon software platform beyond the end of
rollout. The Exceptions Manager will be responsible for recommending to Network stakeholders, in
cases where migration will not be possible by the end of rollout, that a branch be closed in
Reference Data via the OBC process. This is not a decision that can be taken lightly as it will
mean the branch being closed for potentially up to 30 days. It is recommended that Network have
a ‘decisions panel’ operating each week throughout the last month of rollout to take decisions
on any branches falling into the exceptions process as the deadline approaches.

The Exceptions Manager will be additionally responsible for the following:

= Attempting to resolve all escalations within 14 days.

=" Weekly conference calls (moving to daily in the last month of rolloit) to discuss progress on
branches in the escalations process with IRT and POMST representatives

=" Keeping Network stakeholders informed of number of branches migrated against target and any
early warnings if the tail end management is likely to see larger numbers than expected.

=" Link from POMST into the corrective action process. This makes sense due to the fact that
although a branch may justify corrective action, if it is also going into the tail end of the
rollout when this occurs, that situation will need to be managed also.

=" Liasing with External Communications, Flag Case Team and the NFSP if required for some of the
more sensitive cases.

2.4.1 Corrective Action

Section 2.4 above outlines the Exceptions Manager in Network as the link into the Corrective
Action process. This is due to the fact that the Corrective Action process may still not be
responsive enough to ensure a branch is migrated before the end of rollout, particularly if the
branch in question is towards the end of the rollout. The escalation points for the Corrective
Action process are as follows:

= Crown Offices - Exceptions Manager to liase direct with the BDM for the branch
=" National Multiples - The relevant Senior Account Manager
=" Agency Branches - The relevant Contracts Advisor

The standard corrective action process for dealing with branches will be initiated by the
relevant Contracts Advisor or, in the case of National Multiples, the relevant SAM. The
Contracts Advisor/SAM will liase directly with the BDM in the case of any Account Managed
branches. Corrective action against branches is an established process with defined steps to be
followed, although the process will be expedited in the case of agency branches by the fact that
a verbal warning will have already been issued by POMST in the telephone conversation with the
branch. Contracts Advisors and SAMs will be advised of the impact of branches not migrating by
the end of rollout and this will be built into their communications with branches and National
Multiple partners.

3. Management Information Provision

In addition to the management information stipulated in the previous sections of the document,
