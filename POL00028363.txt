Dave,

From yesterday's wrap up meeting, you were considering whether or not it was not it was in POCL’s
interests to declare to ICL Pathway that Acceptance could not be given on 16th.

This is based on a literal (hard nosed) view of the contractual situation.

1. The Data Integrity/ Acceptance Incident (376) is an agreed High

2. The end date of retest is, I believe, in the contract as 2 weeks after the end of the core observation
period - which gives Sth August for end of retest.

3. 376 had not been retested satisfactorily by that date.

(In fact the only extant plan for revolution of 376 is a codifiesd work around)

There may be value in tecording the postion with Pathway even if we allow more time for the retest (e.g.
the 3 weeks Ruth feels is a minium level of observation).

Regards

Chris
