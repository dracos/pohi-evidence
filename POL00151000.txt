A couple of thoughts - just reflecting on yesterday’s run through

- We have, in previous correspondence and meetings, asked the question “well, what more would you have us
do ?/what is it precisely that you want?” which I think works well since it leads us to good ground for us —
we’ve done more than any comparable organisation would, we’re collaborating with CCRC, we’re discharging
all our obligations and responsibilities — it would be good for this to come through loud and clear

- There is of course a risk in an approach in which PO says, broadly speaking, that the Scheme is working well in
terms of making it difficult later on to pull the plug on it as it is currently set up or to change it very much —
not sure there’s very much we can do to guard against that but we just need to be alive to it since we weren’t
able to develop a consensus about the way forward before the Committee - if JFSA/SS really go for it in terms
of criticism, that may help restore room for manoeuvre

- [think highlighting perspective is pretty key — while avoiding falling in to the trap of sounding like we don’t
think it’s a big deal for those involved which we clearly do, this is an important but limited issue given the
scale of the business

- And that leads also to the central point of strength for us: there just is NO evidence of an unsafe conviction
(indeed no appeal has ever been made) and there is NO evidence of a systemic flaw with Horizon in any of
these cases

- No person or organisation should be expected to accept responsibility for events where there is no evidence
to substantiate the charge — it is easy to make accusations, and many have, but we should point out that
where they have all fallen short is in backing this up, despite repeated requests for them to do so
