I think we should send to WDB saying how we identified the KEL and that it was deleted from the database by John
was able to find a copy on a local drive.

Pete, in looking in to Lucy Bremner’s question about whether there is a KEL for Callendar Square, John has identified
two Peaks which he believes describe the same issue, even if they were not raised in direct relation to that same
branch, and from that a KEL, which has been deleted and was therefore not in the set of KELs that we have shared
with WBD. John has managed to retrieve the content of the KEL as shown in the email below.

When (if?) I share this KEL, or indeed the Peaks since they reference the KEL, I’Il need to raise the subject of there
FUJ00179940
FUJ00179940

being KELs which have been deleted. Is that OK, have we previously mentioned to them that there are deleted KELs?

If we have to explain that then I suppose we need to know why; John, do you know the criteria? Was this a Horizon
only KEL that once fixed by S80, or once superseded by HNG-X, was no longer required?

Information

Product

Risposte

Symptoms

100 * An unexpected error occurred while attempting to insert a message. Timeout occurred waiting for lock
(0xC1090003) were detected at the counter

Problem

The events started at 17:29 on 1-May-2002 after the counter was rebooted.

The counter produced one of these messages every 10 seconds throughout the night until Cleardesk restarted Riposte
at 03:34,

This cleared the lock and the system has been fine since.

Feb 2003:

We are seeing a few of these each week, on Wednesdays during balancing. This can lead to problems if the PM is
balancing on the counter generating the events, as it may not have a full view of transactions done on other counters.
PC0086212 sent to development.

June 2004:

This event can also give rise to Transfer problems, where the eventing Node was not replicating and so allowed Clerk
to Transfer In [TI] of a txn which had already been TI on another Node for the second time or an Existing Reversal [ER]
of the TI. See details on call E-0406030482 / PCO103864.

Sept 2005:
This problem is still occurring every week, in one case at the same site on 2 consecutive weeks. PCO126376 sent to

development.

Solution

This problem seems to be cleared by either rebooting the affected counter or Cleardesk running in the morning.

SMC: If the event is seen at a multi-counter office during the working hours of the PO, or up to 18:00 on a weekday (in
case they are balancing out-of-hours), RING THE OFFICE AND GET THEM TO REBOOT the eventing counter. If they are
in the process of balancing, it is strongly advised that they reboot before continuing with balancing as they are at risk
of producing an incorrect balance. Warn the PM that if transactions appear to be missing, they should not be re-
entered - they will become visible after the counter has been rebooted.

If a reboot/Cleardesk does not resolve this problem, send the call over for further investigation - SSC can rebuild the
messagestore on the affected counter.

Update: 11/01/2010 Peak PC0193012
If the message was seen on a Correspondence server and the source of the message is Riposte then raise a Peak call
and route it to SSC to stop and restart the Riposte service under OCP. If the errors are seen on more than one

Correspondence server at the same time then further investigations should be carried out.

John,

Thanks for this. It looks like JSimpkins338Q no longer exists, it wasn’t in the set that we sent them. Do KELs get
deleted?

Hi Matthew,

I have spent some time trying to track this down via the branch name, date range, release, problem description etc..
However I have yet to find a matching KEL.

I think that the best fitting Peak is PCO126042 which is for branch 160868 (Cow Wynd) but the branch is in Falkirk.
PC0126376 has a good description of the problem, which is in the Escher product, fixed in the new version at $90.

This KEL JSimpkins338Q appears to apply which should have been in the extract supplied to them.

Regards
John

John,

FUJ00179940

lam being asked if we can confirm if there is / was a KEL for the “Callendar Square” issue. Are you able to confirm
that definitively please?

Please see the attachment which describes it (points 1 — 4); it seems that it was a known issue that was fixed in $90,
and that in this context was of interest because it was brought up in connection with the West Byfleet case.

If it was fixed, and therefore the bug wouldn’t arise again, would a KEL, had it existed, have been deleted?

Thanks

Thanks Matthew.

I've had a look at the information and there is reference in Gareth Jenkins witness statement to an email in appendix c
of Charles McLachlan's report. I've gone through the report but cannot see it included — are you able to send me a
copy of all of appendix c? Gareth also refers to a previous witness statement on 8 February 2010 — do you have a
copy of this?

Also, the report itself contains track changes — do you have a final copy?
Kind regards,

Lucy,
The attached email I sent to you in July included the zip file that was originally provided to Second Sight, and which
includes information relating to the Calendar Square case.

I don’t believe there is a related KEL, but I will check for other information.

You may recall a while ago that I asked you to provide information on Calendar Square, Falkirk. Apologies if I have
missed your response, however I think this request may still be outstanding. Please could you provide me with any
information you have on this. Could you also confirm whether KELs exist for this bug?
