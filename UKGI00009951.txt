2. The UKGI Board had requested a paper on POL given current risks. It was deemed
prudent to have either a portfolio review or risk session on POL prior to the Board. The key
issues facing POL were the franchising of Crown offices; sub-postmaster pay (a pay review
was scheduled for the Summer); NFSP’s public reaction to POL’s statement rejecting the
suggestion of a looming crisis; and, the Horizon litigation. The POL team would begin
drafting the Board paper which would be used as the discussion document for the proposed
executive meeting.

Action: Tom Cooper/Tom Aldred to draft Board paper on POL issues and discuss at POL
portfolio/risk session in advance of submission — 14 June (subject to meeting date)

Action: Tom Cooper to invit IRRELEVANT and arrange a portfolio/risk Exec session on

POL in advance of Board papers being submitted — 21 June
