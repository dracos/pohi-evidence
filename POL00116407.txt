> No, I'm not in touch with Janet on this point. I had understood that you would be following up on the note (I thought this was
sensible as I can't challenge her views on content as I wasn't there) and then Chris A could put a marker down on the SS points
once we have her perspective on the meeting. We have a face to face meeting of the Working Group on 1 April which is probably
the ideal point to follow up as we will also have the Board's views on the engagement letter.
