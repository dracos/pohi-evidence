spent in line with the Accounting Officer’s duties.

questions (notably those relating to the maintenance of fairness between
postmasters in different compensation strands) and a timeline for their
resolution;

* consider such issues in accordance with that timeline;

e be consulted on guidance or equivalent documents relating to the various
strands of compensation, and any subsequent changes to them;

¢ monitor the overall progress of all compensation strands, ensuring that
processes are working well and identifying any blockages; and

to be necessary.
