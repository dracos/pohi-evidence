Another short update for Kelly on the litigation. There is no update on the substantive issues, but the courts have pushed

back the timetable (again).

- Judgment on the ‘Horizon’ trial is expected during September or October. The Court of Appeal have now
indicated they may hold the oral hearing on the question of permission to appeal the ‘Common Issues’ judgment
between 12" and 14" November. Mediation cannot begin until after the ‘Horizon’ judgment and the Court of
Appeal’s decision on whether Post Office can appeal the ‘Common Issues’ judgment.

- We don’t expect mediation to begin before December 2019 at the earliest.

- Inthe meantime, POL’s legal advisers continue to develop their litigation and mediation strategy.

A short update for Kelly on the Sparrow litigation.

¢ The Court of Appeal will hold an oral hearing on the question of permission to appeal the ‘Common Issues”
judgment on 9 October. The Court has advised that a judgment will be made ‘as soon as possible’ afterwards,
although we do not expect this to be made on the day.

e Judgment in the ‘Horizon’ trial is also expected in September or October, and we should have advance notice of
this being issued. It is unlikely that mediation will start until the judgment has been handed down in both cases.
