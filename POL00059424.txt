I     have been asked to                             provide a                statement                  in     the case of                 Angela Sefton
and Anne N.i.e.1c1.                         I understand that                          the inte.gri ty of                     r:he system has been
questioned and this report provides some general information regarding
the :Integrity                        of Horizon.


.1 note            that.          in    the     Defend:: Statement; there                                     is    a     statement                that.        losses
started             in 2005 and a statement                                  that       Horizon was installed                               at      that         time.
As         T    mention below (section 2. 1.) , Horizon                                                     was rolled out between 1999
and         2OU 2,      so        I    am   surprised              at      the      references                to    2005.          However              there        was

a         significant                  change         to       llo..l. i    on      that           was         implemented               late           in      2005,
namely the removal of the weekly Cash Account report and the move to the

to     replicate                   the data                at        regular               intervals                   until       it     is     finally               copied

Statement of


Transactions are carried out locally on the Horizon Online counters and
a Basket is built up during a Customer Session.                               Each transaction will
result in a Basket Entry consisting of one or more Accounting Lines.                                                   At
the end of a Customer Session when the Basket has been completed and all
Settlement       items     (or. Tender lines) have been processed and added into
the Basket as further Accounting Lines, such that the total value of the
Basket    is    zero,    the entire Basket is sent to the Data Centre as a BALD
Message where the Branch Access Layer (RAW) processes the message and
all. the Accounting Lines are recorded and committed to the BRDB as part
of a single      Oracle Commit.              This moans thati either . all                the transactions
within a Basket are successfully written cr none of them are.                                              Once the
Accounting Lines have been successfully committed a response is returned
to the counter indicating                  this success and this then allows any receipts
to be     printed.         The Basket is deemed to be                  fully        completed once all
relevant receipts have been successfully printed.                                   Note that if there
are. no receipts to be printed, then                      the screen is updated to show the
top level menu indicating                  successful    romp.etion of the previous Basket.

The   Oracle       Commit     also         includes     an    Audit    of       the       data          originally
transmitted from the counter to the BEDS.                       This data is digitally signed
at the counter using a key generated as part of the Log On process.                                                    It
is this    audit     record that           is used to provide the extract. of transactions
used for Litigation support.

Any   auditable      message         from     the    counter, is      stored,         together             with       its
Digital Signature and other key attributes in an "Audit table" (known as
the Message J>u, tie I) in. BEDS.                   Each night atier midnight, the contents

Statement of

for a number of case_ where the Integrity has been challenged. I am not
aware of any cages whore the integrity of Horizon F..))Ilee has VOL been
successfully <chaltcn ed in court..

The        main challenges in          the cases in           which      I   have been      involved were
presented as "Hypothetical issues" and my previous Witness Statements
went        through    each      of   these       hypotheses     and     showed      that   there      was   no
specific evidence for any of thorn in the data presented.


In summary 1 would conclude by saying that I. fully believe that Horizon
will accurately i:ecord all data that is submitted to :it and correctly
account for           it:.       However   i L.    cannot compensate           for    any data        that   is
incorrectly input into it as a result of human error, lack of training
or fraud (and nor can any other system)
