Team Purpose

To identify non conformance and fraudulent activity within the branch
accounts .

Since 2008 additional agency resource has been used on the team to enable
detailed Branch Investigation. This resource has been utilised to check branch
accounting activity and also has been used to identify new fraudulent
indicators. It has also been used to support elements of the Santander
contract with POL to address non conformance and identify fraud relating to
Green giro transactions and despatch

To develop and enhance Fraud indicators strong working relationships have
been formed with Security, Network and Cash Inventory in order to share best
practice, knowledge and experience.

Since the introduction of these roles the value of new debt has been reduced
from £7m to £2m in 2011.

Any Audit loss of over £20k that has not been identified by the team should be
analysed and lessons learned incorporated into BAU process. It is essential to
regularly review the teams’ processes and priorities in order to maintain the
reduction in new debt.

Escalations

The team escalates branches to different parts of the business. The different
types of escalations are as follows. Before making the decision to escalate it
is often necessary to seek further information / views from others e.g
Operational team, Cash Inventory, Security

Team members will submit an escalation form to the Escalation duty on the
team detailing clearly and concisely why they believe further action is
required. It is important to remember that other parts of the business are not
familiar with Credence / SAP reports / Accounting terminology

An audit visit will only verify cash and stock being held in the branch, If

Cash in pouches need to be verified , this should be stated on the
intervention request form

Robberies

When a Robbery takes place and the amount stolen is over £1k an audit visit
will take place and a P32 will be provided. If less than £1k stolen a report will
be provided by the NBSC

The amount stolen is entered into Robbery Suspense — 539107. A transaction
correction is then issued by the team to transfer the amount to Robbery
Culpability .- 539108

A decision is made by the Contract Advisor regarding the level of culpability
and based on this information the amount is either written off or transferred to

F/965/16
POL00002086

Current Agent Debt . If a cheque is received by Current Agents debt as
payment for culpability they will transfer this amount to the 539108 GL

Crowns

There is a duty on the team who monitors the Crown Loss/Gains posted at
Branch Trading and provides various reports on a weekly / periodic basis to
Finance Analysts, Crown Network colleagues and Security programme
managers. This collaborative working has played a key part in reducing

Crown Office losses during the past couple of years.

Branch Trading - Calendar, monitoring process

Since the introduction of Branch Trading in 2005 , the team leader has had
ownership of the Branch Trading process. This includes responsibility for On
line Help instriuctions for Branch Trading processes and the production of the
Branch Trading Calendar and providing the dates annually to the
Communication and Reference Data teams. It is a contractual requirement
that branches complete a Branch Trading each period.

Attached is the raw data which may be useful when compiling future
calendars . This must of course be checked but it’s a start.

C:\Documents and
Settings\cathy.macdc

With the introduction of Horizon on line , the NBSC ceased the monitoring of
Branch Trading being completed within 42 days. It was identified that some
branches had not completed a Branch Trading statement for a considerable
period of time — over 100 days , it was therefore agreed with the National
Contract Advisor that the team would identify branches not completing a
Branch Trading Statement within 50 days ( to allow time for annual leave and
keep investigations to a minimum level) . A report is produced from Credence
and a duty on the team will investigate any branch not completing a BTS
within the 50 days and escalate as appropriate.

ONCH

The team has been a key player in the Security ONCH programme review .
The team has forged links with Cash Inventory and Security to share
knowledge and experience . This has played a key role in reducing new debt

Development

Currently on the team is dedicated resource to ensure that where possible the
most efficient method of detecting fraud and non conformance is used . A
huge amount of data is extracted every day and to ensure that we optimise its
use and conserve space on the network this is an effective use of a role — if
the right person is in post . The right person needs to have exceptional Excel
skills and ideally a background in software applications.

Support to other areas

The team regularly receives requests to support other areas of the business.
These include

Network Performance Team

The Network Performance team reminds branches to complete various
training requirements . To enable the business to reach stretching targets
Fraud & Conformance will assist by reminding branches of the various tests

F/965/20
that need to be completed as part of our BAU calls. We do not make specific
reminder calls

Security

The Fraud & Conformance team is often required to support various Security
led Programmes

Measures

Data is collated in Sharepoint by period. These include
e¢ Cheques at Site calls
e Rota checks undertaken
e Green giro activity
e Rolling loss activity

Data regarding escalations is collated in Excel in T drive . This includes
e Audit results
e Dates of escalation and to who
e Reasons for escalation

Each quarter the Visio measures are collated to provide a visual record

C:\Documents and
Settings\cathy .macde

Manpower measures are recorded by team members and the categories are
as follows
e Branch Investigation
Crowns loss/gains
Non conformance calls
Escalations

Building Momentum
In order to spread the Positive Mindset message the team has been divided

into 3 groups to identify areas of improvement to the team.
Improvements identified are

e Notice board — publishing the teams results /successes
e Sharepoint — improved use of data
e Comms cell — better information sharing

All groups have a leader and meet regularly to discuss progress. The
Sharepoint group have a news letter . All will document their activities ,
