1. Executive Summary

The purpose and scope of this report is to explain the current Fujitsu Software Delivery Life Cycle used
for Horizon Applications. It provides POL with information to understand how Fujitsu delivers this
element of the contracted services.

On 20 August 2020, POL requested an audit of Horizon by sending a letter to Fujitsu titled “Horizon
Audit’. Following a number of discussions between POL and Fujitsu, it was agreed by POL that Fujitsu
would prepare a set of reports on key topic areas identified by POL.

The spirit of the discussions between POL and Fujitsu was to share content that would allow both
organisations to confirm the efficiency of the current ways of working together, and to identify ways to
make meaningful improvements. Fujitsu believe in collaboration and welcome constructive suggestions
from POL.

This report explains the Software Delivery Life Cycle used for Horizon Applications (“SDLC Report”). It
follows the “Expanded Table of Contents for the SDLC Report” (COM/MGT/REP/4163) which was
shared with POL on 01 December 2020.

The SDLC Report covers the lifecycle from Requirements to Release excluding “Test” activities which
are subject to a separate report entitled “Testing & QA Report” (COM/MGT/REP/4166).

Fujitsu's Software Delivery Life Cycle for the Horizon application is based on widely recognised industry
standard approaches and has been refined to meet the needs of POL and the current Horizon Contract.

This Report explains how the SDLC is operated for POA and shows the many points of engagement with
POL and the joint processes throughout.

Fujitsu has endeavoured to ensure that the content of this report is correct as at the date of issue. Fujitsu
reserve the right to make changes to the way we work in the ordinary course of its operations and
business without obligation to update this report. POL should verify the position with Fujitsu before
relying upon any information or content from this report, as well as bearing in mind the requirements set
out in “Information Distribution” at Section 8 below.

The author has assessed the information in this report for risk of disclosure and has assigned an
information classification of FUJITSU CONFIDENTIAL. This report is also subject to further Information
Distribution statements at Section 8 in this report.

POL is invited to comment on this report to seek any additional clarifications it needs. Fujitsu will
endeavour to respond to any comments or clarifications requested and may, if it deems necessary,
provide an updated version of this report.

Fujitsu welcome the opportunity to provide this report.

2 Purpose & Scope

The purpose and scope of this report is to explain the current Fujitsu Software Delivery Life Cycle used
for Horizon Applications. It provides POL with information to understand how Fujitsu delivers this
element of the contracted services.

POL is invited to comment on this report to seek any additional clarifications it needs. Fujitsu will

Fujitsu welcome the opportunity to provide this report and looks forward to a constructive dialogue with
POL.

3. Background & Introduction

On 20 August 2020, POL requested an audit of Horizon by sending a letter to Fujitsu titled “Horizon
Audit’. Following a number of discussions between POL and Fujitsu, it was agreed by POL that Fujitsu
would prepare a set of reports on key topic areas identified by POL.

The spirit of the discussions between POL and Fujitsu was to share content that would allow both
organisations to confirm the efficiency of the current ways of working together, and to identify ways to
make meaningful improvements that would enhance the working relationships and hopefully ensure a
better experience for the POL branches and their postmasters. Fujitsu believe in collaboration and
welcome constructive suggestions from POL.

This report explains the Software Delivery Life Cycle used for Horizon Applications (“SDLC Report’). It
follows the “Expanded Table of Contents for the SDLC Report” (COM/MGT/REP/4163) which was
shared with POL on 01 December 2020.

The SDLC Report covers the lifecycle from Requirements to Release excluding “Test” activities which
are subject to a separate “Testing & QA Report” (COM/MGT/REP/4166).

As a general comment, it is important to note that Fujitsu is only one supplier involved in the overall
delivery of end-to-end services to POL in relation to Horizon. The Horizon application also relies on the
working partnership between POL and its chosen partners — such as Verizon, Computacenter and Atos —
as well as external service providers such as banks and affiliated organisations. This applies to both the
IT systems and the operational processes in Horizon.

Although every effort has been made to avoid confusing jargon in this report, the very nature of this
aspect of the service delivered to POL necessitates the use of many acronyms and phrases that may
need expanding upon to ensure the correct understanding. Fujitsu accepts that further explanation may
be necessary and encourages POL to seek these clarifications.

Fujitsu has endeavoured to ensure that the content of this report is correct as at the date of issue. This
report has been prepared with the input of numerous Fujitsu individuals and attribution of any statements
made in this report should be made to Fujitsu only. In preparing this report, the authors have collectively
characterised and summarised many internal Fujitsu documents. They have also described processes
and procedures which have been established over many years and may not be in written form. Many of
the documents, processes and procedures described in this report are continuously updated and Fujitsu
reserve the right to make changes to the way it works in the ordinary course of its operations and
business without obligation to update this document. POL should verify the position with Fujitsu before
relying upon any information or content from this document in the future as well as bearing in mind the
requirements set out in “Information Distribution” at Section 8 below.

4 SDLC

4.1 Overview of Process

This section presents an overview of the HNG-x Project, including its engineering lifecycle, the roles of
the Fujitsu team that operate within the lifecycle and the products generated by it through the BAU
Change Process.

It is important to note that if a programme of work operates and is managed separately from HNG-x, it
may do so under a different set of processes, and may have differing roles and products. For example,
the current Belfast Exit (Pivot to Cloud) Programme, which is being directed by POL, has different roles
and processes from the HNG-x Project.

Previous versions of the HNG-x engineering lifecycle were historically based on the Fujitsu corporate
processes which, at the inception of the HNG-x Project, pertained to: the Fujitsu corporate Applications
Design and Build Method (ADBM), the Infrastructure (IDBM), the Test and Validation (T&V) equivalents,
and the Fujitsu standards for engineering and testing. In agreement with the POL (then Royal Mail
Group, now Post Office Ltd), the original HNG-x Development Strategy (now deprecated) expanded on
this and identified that the nature of the HNG-x Project required elements of ADBM, IDBM and T&V to
be combined to form a single new engineering lifecycle methodology (Design and Build Method): The
HNGxDBM.

Fujitsu are required to operate a generic Development Lifecycle methodology designed to deliver the
required Development Services as set out in Schedule B1.1 of the Horizon Contract, and specifically
Clause 3 of Schedule B1.1. The generic Development Lifecycle methodology is HNGxDBM.

The processes have been refined over time to follow changes to general working practises, including to
align with changes to Fujitsu's own processes where appropriate, as described in the Fujitsu Europe
Business Management System (EBMS) (Fujitsu Internal).

This document also describes the key roles of the Fujitsu team referenced in the HNGxDBM processes.
These roles are detailed in Appendix A - HNGxDBM Role Descriptions.

The diagram below shows key inputs and outputs to the lifecycle process.

The process diagram above is explained in the next sections of this document.

4.1.1 HNGxDBM Product Descriptions

Product Descriptions provide details of each artefact potentially generated by the HNGxDBM
engineering lifecycle. Product Descriptions assist in giving the team member to whom the product is
allocated a clear understanding of what is required. It also forms the criteria/benchmark that the
completed product is evaluated against when it is submitted for review.

Where possible HNGxDBM Product Descriptions will conform to the overall structure and layout set out
in the HNG-x document template.

Some artefacts may be supplied by POL or a third party for a particular BAU Change programme and as
such, whilst being deposited in Dimensions, will not conform to the required HNG-x document templates.

In other instances, an artefact may be produced from a tool, in which case strict compliance with the
HNG-x document template may not be possible. Where such an exception exists, it will be noted in the
Composition element of the Product Description.

4.2 Define Solution

This section describes the initial phase of the SDLC: defining the solution.

4.2.1. Process Aims & Objectives

To clarify POL’s and HNG-x Project staffs understanding of the Stakeholder Requirements and the
scope of the agreed solution design.

Communication links will have been established with POL and other stakeholders for each group of
changes that are to be delivered in a Release. Details of such links can be found in the associated
Project Management documentation for that Release.

In other cases, details of POL or other stakeholders can be found in the associated Change Request
(RTQ) or Change Work Order (CWO) documents.

The iterative nature of design-code-build-test may
result in coding starting before a final approved
version of the CTP is available. This is a risk
position that must be assessed by the Lead
Developer before coding starts.

The review checks the plans against criteria of
compliance to HLD/LLD, completeness of testing
‘scope and consistency of testing across related
components.

The review of the CITP also considers the
consistency of the integrated testing to be
conducted with the testing already undertaken at
individual component level

Stage 2: Build Platforms (Including OS)

This stage describes the steps required to provision the platform instances on the hardware configured in
Stage 1. The computer.xml containing the platform information and the PSPID (Platform Set Platform
Instance Definition) that contains the software products and ordering is uploaded in to the deployment
servers TEM and TPM. The software is then despatched (deployed) on to the Integration rig, which
creates the Platforms, deploys the OSs and the software products. Checks are then performed to test that
the platforms are running and visible to the network and that the software products have deployed.

Stage 3: Create Product Version Baselines and Deployable Product
Version Baselines

PVBs are created by the Development teams and consist of the compiled code (executables and
supporting components e.g. .exe, .DLL), run time scripts and installation instructions. Integration also act
as the Development team for certain product deliveries, such as OS updates and OS security patches.
These individual components are uploaded in to a PVB in Dimensions.

Integration extract the PVB (components) from Dimensions (see “Sample Dimensions screenshot Showing
PVBs and DPVBs” below) and then create the installable scripts based on the instructions in the handover
note. These scripts are tested to check the scripts work as expected. The components and scripts are
then bundled in to an installable file and uploaded in to a DPVB in Dimensions.

Stage 4: Maintain Platform Product Spreadsheets

This describes the steps required to maintain the spreadsheets that define the order of installation of the
DPVBs. When a new software product is required, the Development team or Platform owner update the
PPD with the new product. This will show where in the install order this product should be in relation to
other products, after its dependencies and before anything that depends on it. For example, MySQL
would need to be installed before the create table product is installed. The Integration team use the
information in the PPD to insert the product name in to the ScmProductStack_*.xls (see “Sample
screenshot Showing ScmProductStack_BALv2.xIs” below). SCM is notified, so that they can update the
product as a valid product in Dimensions.

Stage 7: Integration Test of Deployable Product Version Baselines

The DPVB is uploaded into the deployment server, TPM or TEM. The DPVB is then pushed from the
deployment server to the target Platform or Platforms on the Integration rig. The install logs are checked
for error and that the expected software components have been updated. The DPVB is then regressed
from the Platform using the regress script or instructions, and the checks repeated to verify that the DPVB
has been regressed correctly. The DPVB is then re-installed from the deployment server. The status of
the DPVB is changed to indicate that it is ready for the Test teams and the Test teams notified that the
DPVB works successfully on the Integration rig and the DPVB is available to be deployed to the Test rigs.

If at any stage the install or regress fails, the DPVB status is updated to show this, a ticket in respect of the

A release is a delivery of:

Bug fixes; and/or

Security updates.

Change to functionality; and/or

Once the content is defined, Development complete the work and this will be followed by any Integration
packaging required for the deployment tooling to the rigs.

Release Management work with the Delivery and Operational teams to write an agreed deployment plan.
The focus is on how this release will be deployed into Live Service. Deployment into Test will follow/be a
dry run for Live following the same ordering and post implementation checks. Change Control (TfSNow)

will be used to deploy the release into Test and will record any changes/redeliveries due to findings

during testing. Any changes made during Test Phases are fed back into the Live deployment plan. A
walkthrough of the amended plan is held with the Delivery, Test and Operational teams to produce an
agreed deployment plan ready for Live deployment.

5 Formal Audit Reports

POL has commissioned an ISAE3402 audit as well as quarterly PCI Prioritised Approach audits on POA.
Both audits examined some of the topics discussed in this report. Furthermore, POA are periodically
requested to contribute to internal Fujitsu corporate audits to support Fujitsu UK in attaining and
maintaining a variety of certifications - such as 15027001, ISO9001 and IISO22301.

6 Conclusions

Fujitsu’s Software Delivery Life Cycle for the Horizon application is based on widely recognised industry
standard approaches and has been refined to meet the needs of POL and the current Horizon Contract.

This Report explains how the SDLC is operated for POA and shows the many points of engagement with
POL and the joint processes throughout.

7 Recommendations

None recorded in this version of the report.

Within the context of HNGxDBM there are Solution Architecture, various Development Teams, SV&I and
LST Test Team Managers.
A.2 — Requirements & Architecture

Role Description

Business Business Analysts engage with the Customer (external and internal) to understand and define their real

Analyst Tequirements, and contribute to solution definitions. The Business Analyst seeks to ensure that
requirements are achievable, traceable and can be supported by test or other evidence to facilitate
acceptance.

The BA will prepare and deliver the materials required for Release acceptance and authorisation with the
Customer.

Solution This is a technical role and a crucial project role. The Solution Owner is responsible for all aspects of the

Owner design, requirements realisation, integration, implementation and performance of the project solution,
‘Additionally, Data Protection and Security implications are considered and acted upon by the Solution
Owner. Clearly there may be many Architects involved in the project, covering several technical
disciplines. There is only one Solution Owner; a senior person who works closely with the Project
Manager seeks to ensure that all the technical aspects of the plans are secure.

Platform This is a custodial role, where a first point of contact for general queries on a ‘platform’.

Owner A’platform’ is a functional sub-system component, composed of hardware specifications and application
in software layers — starting from an Operating System base and software and applications to provide
basic “functions” (e.g. printer functionality libraries), system management, network management, backup
utilities, and solution specific applications/functions (e.g. transaction receipt generation).

The Platform Owner is not required to have a detailed and intimate knowledge of the software on the
system/Platform — but rather seeks to efficiently direct enquiries concerning the system/platform.

The Platform Owner is the owner of the relevant PPD document which relates to the platform, and guides
changes made to the PPD.

Domain / Domain / Solution or Application Architects are responsible for the delivery of those aspects of the

Solution or Architecture allocated to them by the Solution Owner.
