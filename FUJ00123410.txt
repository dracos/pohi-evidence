I tried to produce a generic, standard statement, but it's just too messy, particularly if someone else
where to need to use it, so I have resorted to two statements

I have accepted David's changes and then altered to suit either Horizon or HNGX. I've read both a couple
of times and I think they are correct. Please could you review and check for me?

Kind regards

Penny
