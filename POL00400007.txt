Please see my Service Performance slide pack I am presenting to Kevin Gilliland and lead team tomorrow. There may
be some content you could use for the QBR ? Sharon, Rich is trying to work up your May graphs this evening.

This continues to be a very manually cranked process which we need to improve and drive consistency across all our
service areas. Would appreciate any feedback.

Thanks
