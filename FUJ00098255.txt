1 Introduction

This document will supplement the usage of the PinICL system by explaining
what the key fields are and how they should be used.

PinICL is the incident logging system for ICL Pathway Ltd. It is available for
access by Pathway and POCL members of staff and needs to be used accurately
and professionally. PinICL is a tool to enable incidents to be raised, progress to
be monitored and resolutions to be documented, it is NOT to be used as a
forum to air disagreements, to have discussions or to promote viewpoints.
PinICL content is available to all PinICL users including Senior Management,
and once sent the contents of a PinICL cannot be erased from the audit record.

As a PinICL user it is important that you are aware of the status of the PinICLs
either raised by yourself or within your team, and that you monitor their
progress at least daily if not more so. If you feel a PinICL is not receiving the
attention it warrants then escalate the issue, either by telephoning or emailing
the department concerned whom you feel should be doing something about it,
or speaking to your Team Leader for them to raise awareness. Be aware of
those PinICLs which have a fix available as you may be able to take the fix onto
the rig and re-test.

Statistics are drawn from the PinICL system from which a quality status is
inferred. It is important that this is not misleading in any way.

3B Target Releases

Target Release field should be used to identify the register allocated; in some
cases, this is subdivided to indicate the release. Values are:

CSR-Cl2_2R, CSR-CI3, CSR-CI3_2, CSR-CI3_2R, CSR-CI3R (Increments)
CSR-CI4 (CSR+)

3.0 (Beyond CSR)

RODB 2.5, RODB 2.5p, RODB 2.6 (Roll Out Database)

NER (No Fix Required)

UNKNOWN

These releases comprise of the full Incident Management System.

4 Product Groups

BPS

APS

OBCS

TPS

Migration

Ref Data

Build

DW/MIS

EPOSS & DeskTop
Infrastructure
General/Other/Misc

This is a current list of Product Groups used within PinICL. A Product group
value must always be assigned to a new PinICL and can of course change
through its lifecycle as investigation and problem resolution matures.

Each product group has associated products, where a relevant product cannot
be found, the value ‘unknown’ should be used.

Within the same window of Product Groups, there are other non-mandatory
fields:

Operating System - The operating system for which this PinICL relates.

Platform - Hardware on which products run.

S Reference Value

Reference fields are used for any key information that can be used for searching
at a later date.

Using the Reference button, select an appropriate Reference Type and
Reference Value.

For each Reference Type, an expected format will be shown where applicable
for the reference value. Include in here the script being executed, the script
version and the line number of the test being executed which is most pertinent
to the error. eg APSo102 V1.2 Line 286.

This will aid other team members to re-test the PinICL and helps to group the
PinICLs for re-testing within each script.

More than one reference can be added. Ensure that the one you want to be
shown on the call summary screen is selected as Top Reference.

6 Priority

Priority Description Days to Fix
A Programme Stopped 1
B Progress Stopped 3
Cc Progress Restricted 5
D Non-urgent 10

The Priority of the call indicates its importance to the customer.
These are generally interpreted as :

A- Critical error which is stopping any progress on that particular rig, it
cannot be worked around and will cause the test windows not to be met.
It is only possible for there to be one priority ‘A’ PinICL on a rig at any
time.

B- Highly significant error which is stopping any further progress either on
the rig or with the script being executed on the rig, eg the overnight
schedule cannot run due to data errors.

C- _ Error affecting how one aspect is working, can be either a data problem
where invalid data is being written to the database, or a code error where
the user is unable to use a particular client.

D- __ Insignificant and usually cosmetic error, either a documentation error or
spelling error on the system, which always has a work around.

Version: 0.1

The priority to be chosen is very dependent upon the IMPACT being caused by
the problem to the current test cycle and testing window. Therefore, e.g. APS
not working in a blitz proving cycle may only require a ‘C’, but when executing
an APS script during an APS test cycle may warrant an ‘A’. If in doubt about the
priority then speak to the team leader, but don’t delay raising the PinICL and
expediting it if it is of a critical nature.

During particular cycles, ie DIT or Final Pass, PinICLs will tend to be raised
with the highest priority they can warrant as their quick resolution is critical. A
PinICL priority may also be lowered if an acceptable circumvention has been
supplied. It would not be closed however, until the full fix has been re-tested.

The correct Priority can only be deemed depending upon the nature of the
PinICL, which is usually a judgement call. It is essential for the Team Leader to
ensure a realistic Priority is allocated to the PinICL before it is progressed
further.

The call type indicates if the call is a suspected product error or an enquiry, if
the later then what type of enquiry. Listed above is a current list of the Call
Types available, the Blue/Bold Call Types denote those which are used in

today’s

process.

Select an appropriate Call Type from the pull-down list if your default is not
appropriate. The correct Call Type is deemed depending on what the call is
being raised for and by whom, e.g. Call Type ‘L’ is for Live calls, and can only be
used by SSC.

200 F Call withdrawn by user

This is a definitive list of all response categories available within PinICL, the
Blue/Bold categories denote those most frequently used.

The Response Category is a mandatory field which denotes the PinICL status
within the lifecycle, split between four stages Open (new call), Pending (work
in progress), Final (fix released) and Closed, it identifies the type of response
given to the contact fora call.

The essential difference between Pending and Final is that with Final, the call is
routed back automatically to the originator, with Pending, it stays with the user
unless routed explicitly.

Whenever a PinICL has new text entered it must have a suitable response
category otherwise you will not be given the option to send the PinICL further.

The Response Categories available when updating a call depend upon the Call
Type and your own personal privileges for use of the PinICL system.

Actiow

Action is a process by which a call is passed to someone other than the assignee
of the call so that they can work on it. Calls transferred in this way stay on the
stack of the assignee, but marked to show it has been passed to someone else.

If Action is for an internal team, select the relevant team and contact.

It Action is for an external party, whom e.g. may have to investigate the PinICL,
type in their details if not already there.

Detorily
Holds the details of the call logger. This can be updated with new details while

the call is still open for only the selected call.

Normally, the Logger and the Contact are the same. Used if someone leaves or
moves team, to indicate who has taken over responsibility for the call.

Root Cause Analysix

The main concept of Root Cause Analysis is to ensure the same errors do not
occur twice.

A root cause value is mandatory for all new calls, The defect cause may change
during the life cycle of the call as investigation matures and a better view of the
problem is identified.

Coll Effort

Whenever a call is updated with new progress, and the ‘send’ button pressed, a
template for the Call Effort is displayed.

The call effort field is related to the actual number of hours that the user has
spent updating the call since it was received.

For example, .1 equals one tenth of an hour.

¢ It is vital that this field is updated with the utmost accuracy, as
misuse/inaccuracy will demean the overall objective of having such a field
and invalidate future reporting analysis.

Knoww Error Log

AKEL - Known Error Log, is a database (owned by SSC) containing descriptions
of problems and solutions which have arisen in the past, therefore giving access
to readily available fixes at any time.

e Why Raise a KEL

KEL’s are searched on every call raised to the SSC - it is part of the
HSH/SMC procedures that the KEL MUST be checked prior to passing a call
from Powerhelp into PinICL. The SMC have filtration targets placed on
them which includes negative points for calls passed to the SSC which are
subsequently closed as Known Error.

¢ Howto Access SSC Web Site
Log onto the ICL Intranet.

Access web site:

Enter your allocated username and password (obtainable via SSC).
¢ Howto search KEL Database

From the main menu list-box, highlight ‘Searches’.

Select ‘KEL Database Search’.

Using specific keywords, enter a brief description of the problem.
Tailor the list-boxes to narrow the search. (For detailed information on how
to search for KEL’s select the instructions option at the top of the page).

Press Execute Query button.
You will be given a list of previous KEL’s related to your query.
Select the blue text (a KEL) to view in more detail.

e How to create KEL

From the main menu list-box highlight ‘Searches’.
From the submenu select ‘Create KEL Online’.

Then it is simply a case of completing the boxes. (For more information on
how to create KEL’s and the type of data required in the fields select the
help option at the top of the page).

When completed, select the Create KEL button.
¢ Update Existing KEL

Find the KEL you want to update (this is done by following the ‘How to
Search KEL Database’ instructions above).

Reference.

This will bring you to the Update KEL screen, where you can type over the
contents of the original KEL. (For more information on type of data required
in the fields select the help option at the top of the page).

When all updates are complete, press Update KEL.
e Process of approval for KEL’s by SSC

KEL’s created or updated by staff who are not members of the SSC are
vetted by a member of the SSC before they are made visible to the whole
audience.

14 Clone PWICL’y

A Clone PinICL is a copy of an original PinICL, used to manage the delivery of
equivalent fixes into multiple baselines or for workaround solutions.

¢ How to Raise a Clone PinICL
Open the PinICL you want to clone.
From the menu options select: Call, Clone

This will prompt you to confirm that that the original PinICL will be cloned
(providing Original and Clone PinICL numbers).

The clone PinICL is then displayed on screen.

Note the summary displays Copy PCXXXXXXX then remaining text from
summary of original PinICL.

Now certain fields can be modified to reflect the purpose of the clone, such
as:

¢ Target Release
e Priority
e References

e Add your text/response, then route the clone to the appropriate team.

The Priority of the Clone PinICL should be reduced by one level against the
original PinICL to reinforce the fact that we are actually only dealing with Clone

PinICL’s. e.g
Original PinICL Priority Clone PinICL Priority
A B
