Thanks Belinda. Nothing to add to the
Legal aspects except to say that I thought the LL session was excellent and reassuring.

On the definition of the relationship with Second Sight personally I am not sure why you would not seek to
regularise a relationship ahead if deciding the future of the mediation scheme and their role on it. If we are not
going forward with them are they not easier to remove with no agreement?

I assume the justification is therefore purely confidentiality but shouldn't the agreement bind them to what we
want from them and when we want it rather than earlier on?

Sorry if 1 am missing the point.
Regards
