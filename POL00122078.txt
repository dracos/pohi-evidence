Andy

I have had a quick read & can discuss further tomorrow. The only points I can see at the moment are:-

POL Pros Policy

1.1.2 Recognises the importance of the integrity of the mail and accordingly will consider prosecuting offenders

who are believed to have interfered with postal packets (S83 of the Postal Services Act 2000).
Is this not for RM to prosecute?

New Cri Enf Pro Policy
Informal Action
Is this similar or same as a Formal Caution?

Action taken by the offender to repay or make amends for criminal act — Is this only for low value?

Flow Chart
Investigations & Security Team ?

Cheers

All,

I have already had sight and previously commented on some of this, so given the tight timescales can I suggest as a
number of us are already in Manchester on Thursday for the TCG that we all review best efforts (appreciate some are
on A/L), and then I will arrange a conference call for Thursday. A collective discussion/response will ensure we are all
on the same page.

John,

Checked your diary and if Thus pm is okay, say 2-3 I'll send invites?
Cheers,

Andy

Dear Andy and et al.

As Post Office Ltd has separated form Royal Mail Group, there is a new to review the Prosecution Policy for the
business to ensure it is fit for purpose for our particular organisation and then endorsed by ExCo and the POL Board.

Please find attached a number of documents as detailed by Jarnail’s email below. We've had an initial meeting on
Monday and some amendments will be made in terms of the policy and stance to be taken. However there is now a

very short review period and I will be reporting back before going on leave this Friday.

Please review the policies and feedback any comments as a collective by email by Thursday so that I can collate and
respond.

Happy to discuss individually or collectively on a conference call, if so please give me a ring or arrange.
Not to be circulated wider please.

Cheers.
John.
