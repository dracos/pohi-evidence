                       POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY




           FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF DAVLYN CUMBERLAND




I, Davlyn Cumberland, will say as follows:



Introduction


1.   This witness statement is made to assist the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry (the

     "Inquiry") with the matters set out in the Rule 9 Request dated 24 April 2023 (the

     "Request"). I have received advice and assistance from a lawyer in the

     preparation of this statement.

My professional background


2.   I am an employee of Post Office Ltd ("POL") and have worked in a number of

     roles since 1990. The dates I have given in the account below are accurate to the

     best of my recollection.


3.   I originally started working for POL in August 1990 as a counter clerk. During the

     first few years I worked in a variety of main Post Office branches in Wokingham,

                                                                                   WITNO9130100




     Bracknell, Camberley, Reading and Salford City.


4.   I had a 6-month break in 1993 and returned as a casual worker at Camberley

     Post Office in 1994. That role became permanent. After a few months I

     transferred to Reading Post Office and then went on to work as an on-site trainer

     for a period of 18 months before returning to work in Reading Post Office in 1996.


5.   In 1999 I moved north and worked for a brief period at Salford City Post Office

     before joining the Horizon Implementation Programme in September 1999 as a

     Horizon Field Support Officer.


6.   In 2001 1 joined a programme called the Retail Line Review Trial and worked in

     an admin/support advisors' role. Two new teams evolved from this, the

     Performance Improvement Team and the Suspense Account Team. I spent

     several months working in both teams.


7.   In 2004 I joined the Network Reinvention Project in an admin support role, which

     involved approving processing grant applications from independent sub-

     postmasters.


8.   In 2005 I was promoted to the role of Area Intervention Manager, providing on-

     site support and guidance to Post Office branch staff, sub-postmasters and

     managers.


9.   In 2006 I was promoted again to the role of Contact Issues Manager. In that role

     I managed the administrative support team who supported the contract managers

     nationally. The team were required to send letters, acknowledge resignations,

     arrange completion of vacancy reports, book interviews, answer queries or

     escalate queries to the relevant contract manager. This was a new role which


                                      Page 2 of 13
                                                                                       WITN09130100
                                                                                     WITNO9130100




     evolved over a period of two years. I became involved with implementing new

     processes such as the process of appointing temporary postmasters. I worked in

     this role until 2008.


10. I took a further career break, this time for four years, before re-joining POL in

     2012 to work on the Network Transformation Programme as a Field Change

     Advisor.


11. In 2013 I joined the On-site Training Team where I have worked to this day, apart

     from a period from August 2022 to April 2023 when I was on temporary

     secondment to the Training Scheduling Team.



My role in the Suspense Account Team


12. I have been asked to describe in particular my role in the Suspense Account

     Team, and I have set out an account of this here as I remember it to the best of

     my knowledge.


13. As I mentioned above, from 2001 until 2004 I worked in a team that was initially

     called the Retail Line Review Trial. The Retail Line Review, as far as I can recall,

     involved centralising the support from the regional helplines to the new Network

     Business Support Centre and closing the regional area offices (with the exception

     of the area offices which served the rural network).


14. The Retail Line Review split the Post Office branch network into two categories:

     Community (Rural) and Commercial. The Rural network was supported by area

     offices and the Commercial network was supported by Retail Line Managers.


15. Two new centralised teams were also formed and were initially based at the


                                      Page 3 of 13
                                                                                     WITN09130100
                                                                                   WITNO9130100




     Network Business Support Centre in Barnsley. These two teams were called the

     Suspense Account Team and the Performance Improvement Team. I worked in

     both teams.


16. My role in the Suspense Account Team was to contact Post Office branches by

     telephone to discuss and, if necessary, raise queries about unauthorised

     discrepancies (representing unaccounted for losses and gains) held in the

     suspense account, using the data supplied to my line manager every month from

     a team based in Chesterfield. My line manager would then distribute the workload

     throughout the team.


17. In addition, I was required to contact Post Office branches by telephone whenever

     a call had been escalated to our team by an advisor in the Network Business

     Support Centre, which was the first point of contact for sub-postmasters,

     managers or branch staff seeking authorisation to hold a discrepancy in the

     suspense account for a limited period. My role was to authorise the discrepancy

     to be placed into the suspense account, if the discrepancy was a result of a known

     accounting error. When the discrepancy wasn't authorised, I would offer guidance

     to help locate the cause of the accounting error/discrepancy; for example, to

     check documentation dispatched to savings bank and Giro bank, cheques sent

     for processing, cash and stock remittances in and out of the branch, automated

     payments (bills), currency and travellers cheques had been entered correctly,

     and that pensions and allowances paid to customers agreed with dockets on

     hand. Key stroke mistakes were sometimes the cause of discrepancies, for

     example someone entering £800 rather than £80.


18. These calls could be quite stressful and uncomfortable on occasions, because


                                     Page 4 of 13
                                                                                     WI TNO9130100
                                                                                   WITN09130100




     not all discrepancies would get authorised, and people would sometimes become

     upset. After a period of approximately 6 months, I wasn't really enjoying the job,

     mainly due to the nature of the work and because I didn't find it rewarding or

     interesting, so I asked to transfer to the Performance Improvement Team which

     had then been relocated from the Network Business Support centre in Barnsley

     to Chesterfield.


19. My role as an advisor in the Performance Improvement Team involved contacting

     Post Office branches by telephone to discuss accounting and data input errors,

     based on monthly data supplied by a team in Chesterfield to my line manager.

     My line manager would then distribute the workload throughout the team. These

     were non-financial data input errors which would not cause the branch account

     to have any discrepancies.


20. My role was to offer support and guidance to rectify errors and talk people through

     correct procedures. The aim was to help the branch staff understand correct

     procedures so that, going forward, they could implement changes to improve

     performance in relation to reporting of transactions.


21. I spent approximately six to nine months working in the Performance

     Improvement Team, but it became difficult to continue because the travelling

     commitments were excessive. Eventually I asked to return to the Suspense

     Account Team because less travelling was involved.


22. I have been asked to describe the role of the Suspense Account Team. It has

     been a long time since I worked in the Suspense Account Team, but I have tried

     to describe its role to the best of my recollection.


23. The role of the Suspense Account Team was to monitor and manage

                                       Page 5 of 13
                                                                                     WI TNO9130100
                                                                                   WITN09130100




     discrepancies being held in the suspense account across the Post Office branch

     network. The objective was to reduce the number of discrepancies held in

     individual Post Office branch suspense accounts.


24. If a discrepancy showing in the suspense account was due to a known

     transactional error, with an expected correction to be issued by the relevant team

     in Chesterfield and where proof such as documentation was supplied (for

     example, a cash in payment had been written as a withdrawal, or if the error was

     verified by the relevant team — such as the savings bank, cheque processing,

     Giro bank, cash centre, or automated payments teams) the discrepancy would

     be authorised and it could be held in the suspense account up to eight weeks

     until the correction had been issued. A reference number for the authorisation

     would be provided.


25. If the discrepancy was not due to a known transactional error, then we would

     discuss this with the Post Office branch manager/sub-postmaster, explain that it

     wasn't an authorised discrepancy, and request that the discrepancy be removed

     from the suspense account before the next cash account due date. Any loss had

     to be made good either by cheque or cash, and any gain corrected by a

     withdrawal of cash.


26. If a branch had any difficulty with this process or said that they were not able to

     make good the amount, we would the escalate the case to the relevant area

     manager for Rural branches or the Retail Line Manager for Commercial

     branches.


27. In some cases, a hardship application would be submitted. If this was agreed, a

     discrepancy could be made good by making deductions from monthly


                                     Page 6 of 13
                                                                                      WITN09130100
                                                                                    WITNO9130100




     remuneration.


28. Another part of the Suspense Account Team's role was to telephone Post Office

     branches when a Network Business Support Centre advisor escalated a call to

     our team. This usually happened when a branch sought authorisation to hold a

     discrepancy in the suspense account due to a known error. Our role was to assist

     and support the branch to locate the error. Sometimes the error would get

     resolved during the call, sometimes the branch would call back to say they had

     found the discrepancy.



Early Involvement in relation to Marine Drive Post Office


29. I have been asked to explain my recollection of my involvement in the Marine

     Drive Post Office, where Lee Castleton was the sub-postmaster. My attention has

     been drawn to some documents, including the note of decision to terminate Mr

     Castleton's contract on 10 May 2004 (POL00070758) and a witness statement I

     made in a civil case involving POL and Mr Castleton dated 2 October 2006

     (LCAS0000566).


30. The events described in these documents took place a very long time ago, and

     I'm sorry to say that I have no recollection of them or of any involvement I had in

     them. I cannot recall making the witness statement at LCAS0000566.


31. The note at POL00070758 says that I and my colleague Elizabeth (Liz) Morgan

     helped to explain some discrepancies in the final balance figures, and I note that

    I said in my witness statement at LCAS0000566 (at paragraph 3) that I was asked

     by Liz to examine some branch accounts she had been sent by Catherine

     Oglesby, Mr Castleton's Retail Line Manager. I have some recollection of Liz


                                      Page 7 of 13
                                                                                       WI TNO9130100
                                                                                     WITN09130100




     Morgan asking me to look at some branch paperwork to see if I could spot any

     errors or abnormalities, but I can't remember anything about which Post Office

     branch this related to or what the outcome was.


32. Liz Morgan and I worked together in the Suspense Account Team. We were a

     small close-knit team, and it was usual practice to ask for assistance from

     colleagues. Although checking branch accounts was not officially part of our role,

     I can recall a few occasions when a Retail Line Manager or Area Manager would

     ask for our help with checking branch weekly accounts and possibly the

     transaction logs. I recall that Liz was well known within POL, especially in the

     north, because she worked in the audit team for many years. It wasn't unusual

     for her to offer to check branch accounts although, as I said, it wasn't officially

     part of our role. I cannot recall how many occasions she asked for my help.


33. During my Post Office career, I have gained knowledge and experience by

     supporting sub-postmasters and their staff with back-office duties and weekly

     balancing. Looking back to the time when the events described in POL00070758

     and LCAS0000566 took place, I believe I would have had a good understanding

     of the Post Office branch weekly accounting system. This was gained from

     working as an on-site trainer between 1994 and 1996, using both the old manual

     accounting system and an electronic system (Ecco+) used at the time in our

     Crown branches, and working on the Horizon Implementation Team as a Field

     Support Officer, a job which involved the migration of manual data onto the new

     Horizon system then staying on-site to offer support including completion of the

     first weekly balance.


34. I am unable to recall carrying out the task of looking at the accounts for the Marine


                                      Page 8 of 13
                                                                                         WI TNO9130100
                                                                                       WITN09130100




     Drive branch, of any steps that I took or of any documents that I was provided.

     The note at POL00070758 suggests that Liz Morgan and I came to a view about

     the figures in the accounts and whether there was anything wrong with the

     Horizon system, and I said in my witness statement at LCAS0000566 that we

     were unable to find anything unusual or evidence that the losses were not

     genuine, but I am afraid that I cannot recall anything about how I came to that

     view. I don't recall having any discussions with Catherine Oglesby.


35. I have no recollection of any other Post Office branches reporting discrepancies

     caused by the Horizon system at this time.


36. I have been asked if Liz Morgan or I considered requesting further information

     from Fujitsu. As I say, I cannot recall any specific details of the Marine Drive case,

     but I am satisfied that we would not have had the authority to involve any other

     teams such as Fujitsu as this would be a matter for the investigation teams. As I

     said before, the checking of branch accounts was not officially part of our role

     This was done on a few occasions as a favour to help out Retail Line Managers

     and Area Managers.


37. I have been asked to explain my understanding of Mr Castleton's personal

     financial situation at this time and who was responsible for decisions about

     hardship applications. Again, I cannot recall any specific details of this case.

     Decisions on hardship applications were not part of my role, so I think it unlikely

     I would have had any conversations about Mr Castleton's personal financial

     situation. Decisions regarding hardship applications were usually from the Retail

     Line Manger or Area Manager.

                                                                                    WITN09130100




38. I cannot recall having any involvement with Mr Castleton's case or the Marine

     Drive Post Office prior to the civil litigation referred to in the Request.


Post Office Limited v Lee Castleton


39. I have already referred to the witness statement I made in 2006 at LCAS0000566

     and that I cannot recall these events or making the statement. Neither can I recall

     being involved in any other legal proceedings involving the Horizon system.


40. My attention has been drawn to an email that Stephen Dilley, a solicitor at Bond

     Pearce LLP, sent to Liz Morgan and I on 22 August 2006 (POL00071073). The

     email describes legal action POL was taking to recover losses accrued while Mr

     Castleton was sub-postmaster at the Marine Drive Post Office. It appears to be

     the case that Mr Dilley asked me to provide a witness statement, and that I did

     so, but I am afraid I have no recollection of being asked to make a statement or

     of making the statement.


41. There is also a note of a telephone call I had with Mr Dilley on 2 October 2006

     about a witness statement I had prepared and the process for approving it

     (POL00072707). I cannot recall the details of this conversation, or of any other

     conversations with any other lawyers representing POL. I have no recollection of

     being told about, or being given any details about Mr Castleton's defence or

     counterclaim, or of having any involvement in the disclosure process during these

     proceedings.


42. I am afraid I cannot offer any observations about this legal case since I genuinely

     cannot recall anything about it or what part I played in it.


Other Civil and Criminal Cases

43. I have been asked about my recollection of a number of other individuals who

     were the subject of criminal and civil proceedings, but none of the names are

     familiar to me and I have no recollection of any cases involving them.


44. To my knowledge I haven't been involved in any investigations or criminal

     prosecutions to do with the Horizon system, nor have I been involved in any civil

     cases (apart from providing a witness statement in Mr Castleton's case in 2006).



Knowledge of Bugs, Errors and Defects in the Horizon System


45. I am asked to describe whether I had, or was aware of, any concerns about the

     robustness of the Horizon system during my time at POL. During my time working

     for POL, I have not been aware of or witnessed any bugs, errors or defects in the

     Horizon system whilst performing my daily duties. Working with the Horizon

     system has never given me any cause for concern.


46. I did become aware of some sub-postmasters taking legal action against POL

     and that they had claimed that faults in the Horizon system had resulted in

     accounting discrepancies. I cannot remember exactly when this was, but think it

     must have been after I started working for POL again in 2012. Nor do I recall how

     exactly this was brought to my attention. I recall that senior management at the

     time provided us with a standard response (although I don't recall the specific

     wording) to any questions raised by branch staff while we were outperforming our

     daily roles. To my knowledge, the first time POL acknowledged there could be a

     problem with the Horizon system was during the group litigation case. I think this

     was at some point in 2019 but can't be certain of the exact date.

     Inquiry.
