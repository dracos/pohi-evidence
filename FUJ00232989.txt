1 Purpose & Scope

This document describes the process Fujitsu will follow when making data changes to the Live HNG-X
System in Belfast. It includes the three scenarios that can apply: Change Management; Defined Service
Obligations; and the Horizon Data Change Process.

This document states the actions required, and the local work instructions used, by the teams to perform
the necessary Horizon Data Change Process tasks. Each action clearly states the involvement of Post
Office Limited (POL) in the process.

NOTE: Out of Hours (OOH) will follow the standard Post Office Account (POA) OOH processes.

2 Types of Horizon Data Change

The following are situations that mean that Fujitsu needs to make changes to data in the Live HNG-X
System in Belfast

1. Change Management — typically operational or project changes that follow the agreed POA &
POL Change Management processes and approvals

2. Defined Service Obligations — processes that are defined in contract-controlled documents that
require the intervention of Fujitsu specialist support staff. POL pre-approval is not required

3. Horizon Data Change Process ~ all other scenarios not covered under Defined Service
Obligations. All of these require explicit POL pre-approval, and, in some cases, this will include a
requirement for Fujitsu specialist support staff to be granted temporary additional elevated
privileges (sometimes known as the APPSUP role) to be able to take the action required

Data Change
Process

‘These are described below.

3 Change Management

Changes may be submitted following the defined change management process on POA that require Live
data to be changed. This should be described within the change description and approved by POA and
POL as part of the standard approval procedures and using the agreed service management toolsets.

4 Defined Service Obligations

There are several defined service obligations held within agreed contract-controlled documents (CCDs)
that require Fujitsu to make changes to data in the Live HNG-X System in Belfast. These are shown
below with a summary description. The relevant Fujitsu specialist support staff always have the
necessary privileges to perform these actions. The involvement of POL in each is stated:

‘+ Part of the Fujitsu Reconciliation Service (SVM/SDM/SD/0015 & SVM/SDM/SD/0020).
The Fujitsu Reconciliation Team raise Peak tasks for anomalies identified which then.
leads to the MAC team to raise a Fujitsu Change for SSC. Once the Change is approved
internally by Fujitsu, the SSC run the required script. This happens frequently.
2. Clear Automated Payment (AP) Exceptions (GUI)
‘+ Part of the Fujitsu Reconciliation Service (SVM/SDM/SD/0015 & SVM/SDM/SD/0020).
The Fujitsu Reconciliation Team raise Peaks for anomalies identified which then leads to
the MAC team to raise a Fujitsu Change for SSC. Once the Change is approved
internally by Fujitsu, the SSC use the web GUI. This happens frequently.
3. Generate Reference Data / Integrity checks / Progression to Live
‘+ Part of the Fujitsu Reference Data Management Service (SVM/SDM/SD/0013 &
CSIPRDI058). POL Data Services raise Reference Data requests via the email gateway
PEAK@uk fujtsu.com which generates a Peak task. Requests are only accepted from
specific POL source email addresses. Fujitsu generate data for POL as per its request,
and then move the generated data into a specific directory. The data is then loaded to
the live database using the Fujitsu RDMC GUI. Changes are made via tooling to the
RDMC database.
4, Messaye Broadoast Service (MES) progression to Live
Part of the Fujitsu Message Broadcast Service (SVM/SDM/SD/0018). MBS files are
submitted by POL to a Fujitsu group mailbox
PostOfficeAccount RefDataTeam@uk fujitsu.com. Requests are only accepted from
specific POL source email addresses. The emails are automatically delivered to Live.
There is no user involvement unless faults occur — typically in the POL data submitted.
6. PODG (OBC19)/ Progression to Live
‘+ Part of the Fujitsu PODG OBC19 service within the Data Centre Operations Service —
Annex A (SVM/SDM/SD/0003). POL submit OBC19 forms to Fujitsu by email. Requests
are only accepted from specific POL source email addresses. Fujitsu raise TISNow
Changes for the Fujitsu teams to perform the required actions. Changes are made via
tooling to generate new XML configuration files.
6. Track & Trace Monthly Despatch Report Cut-off
* Part of CCN1627 and included in the Third Line Support Service (SVM/SDM/SD/0004),
Post Office have an ongoing issue relating to subpostmasters not cutting off their Track
and Trace (T&T) reports (formally known as Office Daily Postal Services Despatch
Report) correctly. Fujitsu Service's 3° Line support team perform a manual check each
month to identify outstanding T&T despatch reports and manually remove all records
above the 1500 threshold.

5 Horizon Data Change Process

5.1 Overview
The Horizon Data Change Process applies to all scenarios where changes are needed to data in the Live
HNG-X System in Belfast that are not stated in the Defined Service Obligations.

This process requires that POL pre-approve the actions Fujitsu need to take and that POL are provided
with evidence of the actions Fujitsu took. The process is managed using the service management
toolsets so that an audit trail is created and retained.

The Horizon Data Change Process may require Fujitsu specialist support staff to be granted additional
temporary elevated privileges in order to be able to perform the actions required.

There can be a variety of reasons why a data change is needed to the Live HNG-X data to resolve an
Incident. Any action to effect a change to live HNG-X data must be approved by POL before the action is
taken,

The following are example scenarios under which this Horizon Data Change Process could apply:

5.2 Investigation Stage — the Incident

The process starts with an Incident being logged in TISNow, raised by either POL or Fujitsu. The Incident
must be a bonded Incident. Fujitsu will investigate the Incident and will supply POL with options and
‘suggested recommendations to resolve the issue. If additional temporary elevated privileges are required
to be able to make data changes to the live HNG-X System in Belfast to resolve the Incident, then this will
also be stated within the Incident update that POL will see,

5.3. Taking the Action Required

If the outcome of the Incident investigation is that a data change is needed to the live HNG-X System in
Belfast, then the following process applies:

re

5.3.2 I Obtain POL Approval

1, What action needs to be taken.

2. applicable, Fujitsu will propose a timeframe either at this stage or later in the process.
Otherwise, POL will provide this as part of their approved response.

3. What steps need to be taken (a plan if required).
4. What risks should be understood (if actio

taken or action is not taken),

5. POL will then need to raise the POL Ad-hoc form using the information provided in the Incident

and gain the required POL approvals (see Appendix A for an example POL Ad-hoc form). Fujitsu
is not involved in the POL approval process and only requires a final confirmation and permission
to proceed.

POL will update the Incident to notify Fujitsu that approval has been granted with the approvals
and POL Ad-hoc form attached to the Incident as evidence.

Fujitsu MAC team will check the POL Ad-hoc form matches the information Fujitsu provided in
the Incident to ensure the approval matches the action Fujitsu need to take. If the POL Ad-hoc
form does not match the information Fujitsu provided in the Incident, then the approval from POL
will not be considered appropriate and the request will be rejected, and POL will need to either
amend the POL Ad-hoc form or a new Incident will need to be raised.

NOTE: POL decide the communication messages and involvement actions with
subpostmasters.

5.3.3

Obtain Fujitsu Approval

Once POL Approval has been obtained a final level of approval is needed by Fujitsu as changes could
have been made by POL to the proposed approach or additional information could have been added by
POL as part of its approval process.

b. The Fujitsu MAC team will then assign the bonded Incident to the relevant Fujitsu team, this
will raise a Peak reference allowing updates to be visible to POL.

4. If Fujitsu approval has not been granted:

a, Fujitsu MAC team will update the bonded TfSNow Incident and notify POL that the process
will need to restart as Fujitsu approval has not been granted.

5.3.4 Grant Additional Elevated Privileges - if required

If additional temporary elevated privileges have been cited as needed, then a process is followed to grant
the relevant Fujitsu specialist support staff with the privileges required

4. The relevant team will pass the Peak (raised from the bonded Incident) to the CSPOA Security
team for additional temporary elevated privileges to be granted. The Peak will confirm Date and
Time access is required.

2. CSPOA Security check the TISNow Incident for agreed POL and Fujitsu approvals and that the
request is being made within the stated timeframe. If the required approvals are not supplied, or
the timeframe is incorrect, then the request will be denied, and new timeframes will need to be
agreed

3. If the approvals have been supplied and the timeframe is correct, then CSPOA Security will raise
an internal TfSNow Incident requesting additional temporary elevated privileges and pass to the
UNIX team.

4. CSPOA Security will update the Peak with the internal TfSNow Incident reference and pass the
Peak back to SSC

5._The UNIX team will grant access to the stated Fujitsu support specialist at the start time required
and will contact the required Fujitsu specialist support staff and confirm additional temporary
elevated privileges have been granted. The UNIX team will update the Incident confirming
access has been granted clearly showing the script has been run with result (see figure below for
example of the type of evidence required). If for any reason TISNow is not available, then the
UNIX team will need to confirm the time of the script being run to CSPOA Security and a TISNow
update will be required when TISNow is operational again.

8._The Unix team will revoke the additional temporary elevated privileges and update the TISNow
internal Incident immediately confirming access has been revoked and clearly showing the script
has been run with result before passing the Incident back to the CSPOA Security team (see
figure below for example of the type of evidence required). If for any reason T{SNow is not
available, then the UNIX team will need to confirm the time of the script being run to CSPOA

11. CSPOA Security will close the TfSNow internal Incident.

5.3.4.1 Reporting on Granting of Additional Temporary Elevated Privileges

The granting of additional temporary elevated privileges is recorded using the Fujitsu and POL service
management toolsets and can be reviewed by either party using its own system.

In addition, Fujitsu also report on the granting of additional elevated privileges within the monthly Fujitsu
SecOps report which is shared with POL for its Information Security Management Forum (ISMF) meeting

5.3.5 Make the data change

Once the Fujitsu specialist support staff are ready to make the required change, the following process is,
followed:

1. The Fujitsu specialist support staff perform the actions detailed on the Change, whilst capturing
evidence of the pre and post implementation states, alongside the committed actions. The
actions will be recorded in the Peak.

2. Within the SSC, one member of the SSC will perform the data correction while a second member
of the SSC will witness the change being made. The witness will be recorded in the Peak.

3. The Fujitsu MAC team add the evidence to the Change and the to the T'SNow bonded Incident.
‘See examples in Appendix B — Evidence Examples.

5.3.6 End the process - closing the Incident

Once the required data changes have been made the process of closing the Incident and the Horizon
Data Change Process is performed.

1. The Fujitsu specialist support staff close the Peak with comments and action completed.
2. The Fujitsu specialist support staff close the Change checking evidence has been attached.

3. The bonded Incident with evidence is passed back to POL to review and confirm Incident
closure.

4. POL to confirm the Incident can be closed.
5. POL and Fujitsu close the Incident.

5.4 Reporting on Horizon Data Changes

The actions are recorded within the bonded Incident using the Fujitsu and POL service management
toolsets and can be reviewed by either party at any time using its own system,

If, whilst performing any of these actions, Fujitsu identifies a potential defect in any system or process
that requires investigation and a potential fix — whether that would reduce the likelihood of the need to
perform these actions in the future or not - then Fujitsu will raise a Defect which will then be handled
under the POA Live Defect Management process.
