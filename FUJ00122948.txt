Gareth/Alan

I have gone through the draft witness statement for HNGX transaction records making what I hope are final changes;
again, thank you both for your input. Please would you be kind enough to spare a few more minutes to read through the
final copy? I will then send to Commercial for review.

Kind regards
Penny
