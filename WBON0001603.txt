Hi Katie,

Apologies I miss-informed you previously — we did receive an incident in respect of the latest issue, and I
did have sight of it... It came under a different reference number and different description, which threw
me...

The email trail below shows that we received the incident on 13" Aug, and a fix was identified on 12h Sept.
I can confirm that this fix was deployed to live on 13h Sept 2018.

Kind regards,

James Brett

Hi Akshar,

Attached is the updated Burps script with the fix in. Please check the comparison report to ensure just the
Count Mails script has changed, and then only the 2 steps I updated.

Hello Service Desk,

Could you please raise a non-urgent Service Request on the Accenture Drop & Go production team (on CC
line, above) to investigate why the Drop & Go account associated with D&G card 22145833 was not topped
up by £30 at the date and time given in the attachement.

The attached shows that session 527025 at counter 2 in branch117844 on 31 July at 14:11 topped up a Drop
& Go account. This was settled against a payment card. But Drop & Go account 22145833 shows no top-up
on that date. We have, today, done a correction credit, so the customer is no longer out of pocket. But it is a

mystery how this issue could arise, since Drop & Go on Horizon first credits the D&G account (putting the

entry in its basket) and only then settles. If the credit failed, we would not expect to see it in the basket.

It would be great if you could, please, inspect your log files around this time (compensating for British
Summer Time, if required) for a top up of this amount, at this branch. My suspicion is that a different D&G

account was topped up, accidentally, instead.

Thanks and regards,

Hi Henk,
*Just for info*

Unfortunately the office only had the transaction log available — however from this we can see the ‘Account
Top Up’ and ‘Visa Debit’ payment. So though there isn’t enough to suggest why this issue occurred we can
see that the customers card should have been credited.

Many thanks,
Sam

Hi Henk,

Looking on Credence we can see that the Drop & Go Account Number used in relation to this transaction is
indeed the one in question. I am trying to get a copy of the receipt from the office to see if there is anything
else that may be suggested from it.

Many thanks,

Sam

Hello Maxwell,

This is very odd. The branch would settle what is in the Horizon basket. For the £30 to appear in the Horizon
basket, the Drop & Go account would have been credited first. If that credit had failed, the amount would not
be in the basket and there would be no basket to settle with the payment card.

This suggests that, perhaps, the branch credited a different Drop & Go account. Drop & Go should have
issued a receipt, in addition to the usual session receipt. The Drop & Go receipt would have the last three
digits of the D&G account. What exactly does it say on the receipts?

Hi Henk,

A Drop & Go customer has topped up in branch via a card payment for £30. The transaction went through in
the office, producing a receipt and session ID. We can also see this transaction on the sales Credence reports.
However, the account has not been credited at all on FRE and we cannot find this as an exception.

Details are as follows:

Branch FAD — 117844X

Drop & Go Account

Time/ Date of transaction — 31/07/2018 at 14:11pm

Session — 527025

Could you please advise on how to resolve this situation? The branch is unsure what to do as they are not
showing a £30 gain in the office

Kind Regards
