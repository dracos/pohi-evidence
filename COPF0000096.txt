Thank you for your letter of 28 June indicating the possibility of a plea being
submitted to not more than £20,000.

I have had dealings with the Post Office accounting procedures in relation to other
cases and do accept that some exceptional circumstances can arise in relation to the
way the amounts are calculated. I would have no difficulty in recommending to Crown

Counsel acceptance of a plea to £20,000 or thereby of money.

I note that your client was entirely forthcoming to the Post Office authorities explaining
that she had used the money to pay bills.

For the purposes of early plea submission I will record that the offer was made on 28"

June and await your return from leave to hear from you further.

Yours faithfully

M.M.Macleod
Principal Procurator Fiscal Depute
