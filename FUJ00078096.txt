RE: Model Office Test (DROP3)

The Release 1c, Baseline Codeset for Model Office Test (known as Drop3) will be frozen
at 17.00 hours on Friday 19" September. This means that no more software changes will
be allowed into Drop3 without specific authorisation from me, Mike Coombs or Peter
Jeram. The Model Office test is due to start 6" October 1997, therefore, during the
preceding week (29/9 - 5/10) there is only a 1% chance the such authorisation will be
given.

Once Model Office Test has commenced and for the 3 weeks that it is running, the live
process for code change will be in operation. (Doc Ref: CS/PRD/002 Version 1.0,
31/7/97).

This does not mean that no software changes will be made for the next 6 weeks before we
go live, only that the change will be strictly controlled to avoid any unnecessary
destabilisation.

All Pinicl’s requiring a software change in existence after 19" September must be put on
the Known problem Register (KPR) maintained by John Dicks or an emergency fix
applied after being formally approved by the above procedure.

All existing Pinicl’s that require a software change and that cannot be processed by 17.00
on Friday should be discussed with Ian Morrison and a recommendation formed, for
discussion with the authorisation group.

Any additional Pinicl’s now raised should contain a view as to the severity and impact on
Release Ic, this will assist Piat assessment for the KPR.
