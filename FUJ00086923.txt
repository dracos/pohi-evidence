Summary of Audit 2010.doc

good morning,
for your information I have included the management summary for POL senior managers.

following revision with Lesley this has been expanded to provide Paula Vennels with enough information to handle questions that may arise from

RMG regarding the audit.
to support this more non-technical descriptions and examples have been included.

this is what will be discussed with Mike Young next Tuesday by Lesley and Andy.
once again many thanks for your assistance and cooperation, which has been invaluable,

regards
Don
