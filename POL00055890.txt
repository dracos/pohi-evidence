Dear Rob
Regina y. Alison Henderson - Norwich Crown Court - 15 December 2010 - For Sentence

Further to previous correspondence, I can now report that the defendant appeared before Judge
Binning again today. The judge was troubled by the fact that the defendant’s cheque had not yet
cleared but, upon his being advised by our counsel (Luke Hindmarsh) that we would not wish to
delay the entry of a plea solely on account of this aspect, the judge gave a “Goodyear” indication
that he had in mind a non-custodial sentence (hinting at an Unpaid Work Order), whereupon the
defendant pleaded guilty to False Accounting. (Later the judge recorded a verdict of not guilty to
the count of Theft).

The judge acceded to a defence suggestion that the probation officer in court speak to the
defendant and assess her suitability for unpaid work. A litte over an hour later, the court heard
that she was so suitable and she was thereupon sentenced to an Unpaid Work Order of 200 hours
and she was ordered to pay £1500 in prosecution costs (of £2742.40 sought by us) which are
payable within 4 months. The judge, in sentencing, alluded to the offence as a breach of trust and
added “I take it that your plea was based on muddle and confusion.”

1 have written to the Crown Court asking that the local clerk to the justices be advised that the
costs should be paid to you and not the Crown Prosecution Service.

The matter is now concluded and I enclose (with the hard copy only) my account which I hope
you will find in order.
