[the GAPS only occur on the correspondence server nodes. The reason for these GAPS is covered in PC0162602. If you wish to get
spreadsheets using Bootle you must use the slow ARQ approach. Each spreadsheet will then list the GAPs but since they only occur
cor the correspondence server they do not matter too much. However there is a better approach which follows.

in the secure terminal room is a notice board (on the right wall as you enter the door). On it is a section which says "Possible
caps" and lists "2008 14 Jun to 6 Jul Cluster 3 use Wigan".

I reran a FAST ARQ on Wigan. It was OTH3127W. It ran fine. I asked for all spreadsheets. I notice that Christine said she had
ried a run on Wigan too and it had failed. Whatever reason it had failed there for must have been an intermittent problem rather
than a hard problem. I attach the output from this FAST ARQ.
