Please find attached Statement of Witness as discussed.
Neneh has already signed the statement as requested by Graham W but has expressed concerns hence my coming to
see you.

I have asked Neneh to highlight any areas she is not comfortable with i.e. maybe having to explain in some detail
in court.

Is it possible you could have a look at the statement and advise if you could sign up to this statement or perhaps an
alternative would be to spearate the statement out into two which you and Neneh could each agree to sign up to.

This does seem to be a one off type of statement and not sure if it will ever be brought to court but if it is Neneh is a little
concerned what she might be expected to know/understand/explain should the need arise.

Manyh thanks for your assistance in this.
Kind Regds
