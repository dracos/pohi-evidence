Definitions

1. Write off - the transfer of a debit or credit from the Balance Sheet to the P&L. The debit or credit then
becomes part of Post Office’s income and costs for that year.

2. Suspense Account - a holding GL account used to record transactions that require further investigation,
including where the original or final recipient is unknown.

3. Transaction Correction - corrections to errors made in branches, or by other Post Office areas, that have
been (i) identified in the reconciliation between files received from third parties (clients or suppliers), or cash
and stock centres, and the data recorded by the branch in Horizon, or (ii) caused by mis-keys notified by the
branch or a third party/client, or (iii) to provide funds to the postmaster in some cases where repayment is
required.

4. Branch Reconciliation Team — the team responsible for identifying errors made by reconciling files from 3"
parties (clients or suppliers, such as a bank) and the data recorded by the branch in Horizon. They aim to
resolve any open items (which may result in the issuing of a Transaction Correction) as soon as possible and
within 45 days.

5. Core Finance System (CFS)- the finance system used by Post Office to record all of its financial
transactions.

6. General Ledger account (GL)- a set of numbered accounts in CFS that are used to record and group similar
financial transactions.

7. Debit - a financial transaction, which is an asset on the Balance Sheet, a cost/loss in the P&L.
8. Credit - a financial transaction, which is a liability on the Balance Sheet, income/profit in the P&L.

9. Strategic Partner — A corporate business that operates Post Offices in several locations within their retail
estate. A corporate partner is likely to operate from more than 25 retail stores and has centralised support
function/head office management and has strategic alignment to future POL propositions/network growth.

10. Postmaster Account Support Team — the team that proactively seek open and transparent dialogue with a
postmaster when a discrepancy appears on an account. They recommend the write-off of balances on the
postmaster centralised holding account where it is appropriate to do so.

11. Network Support and Resolution Team — the team responsible for carrying out timely, fair, and transparent
reviews to support postmasters in finding the cause of a discrepancy.

42. The Bureau Finance Team — the team responsible for managing the correspondence and providing support
following the discovery of a counterfeit note in foreign exchange holdings or a discrepancy in an inbound or
outbound remittance.

13. Discrepancy - Any difference between (i) the actual cash and stock position of a branch and
(ii) the cash and stock position shown on Horizon as derived from transactions input by
branch staff into the branch's terminals. A Discrepancy could be negative or positive.

14. Review or Dispute — This is the option on Horizon which moves a discrepancy on to the postmaster’s central
holding account at the end of the Trading Period.

15. Balance Sheet - a summary of the of the assets and liabilities of a business at the end of a given period of
time.

16. P&L (Profit & Loss) - a summary of the income and costs of a business for a given period of time.

7. Budget — an estimate of the income to be earned and costs to be incurred for a given period of time.

Write Off & Suspense Policy I Version 4.4 I Internal I 2024
Page 3 of 16
18. Provision - to recognise a liability on the Balance Sheet for a loss you reasonably expect to incur.

19. Dispute Resolution Committee - A Committee chaired by the Head of Network Support &
Resolution, which is held quarterly with an extended list of attendees to make sure complex
cases seek resolution or require further authority. This is also used to discuss cause analysis

and appropriate action planning.

3. Decision Making Process

3.1. Core Principles
The principles of fairness, consistency and good faith are applied to all write off decisions.

Investigations are carried out to ensure that all credits owed are issued to Postmasters and Strategic
Partners accounts.

Post investigation, all credit transaction corrections will be issued to the relevant branches regardless of
value.

Amounts being held within creditor suspense accounts will be reviewed as part of the balance sheet
reconciliation process and regular reviews in the Retail function.

3.2. Write Off Decisions

All write offs are documented and authorised at the correct level (see section 7 for authorisation levels) and saved to the
appropriate Teams site (for Branch Reconciliation and or Postmaster Account Support), by product and period posted,
these will be saved for a period of 6 years as per the retention schedule.

3.2.1. Branch Discrepancies settled to Review and Dispute

The Network Support & Resolution Team regularly review amounts that have been moved onto the Postmaster central
account (GL1300) when Postmasters have referred the amounts for Review or Dispute.

In terms of investigations carried out by the Network Support and Resolution team, that attempt to find the cause of
discrepancies for Postmasters, debit balances can be written off as a minimum when:

1. An amount is under the approved de minimis level. The de minimis level is defined in the Postmaster
Support Accounting Dispute Resolution policy V4.1 as ‘a monetary amount below which a case will be
considered for write off. ‘The de minimis value is reviewed periodically by the Dispute Resolution
Committee’.

2. A discrepancy amount is considered not cost viable to investigate and falls within Network Support &
Resolution authority limits to approve a write off, for example the cost to retrieve specific data over a
longer period is more than the discrepancy amount.

3. The cause of the discrepancy cannot be established after investigation.

4. The outcome of a case is overturned following recent evidence. E.g. in the case of a Transaction
Correction dispute.

5. The discrepancy is unlikely to be paid — for example, discrepancies on account at the point of the
Postmaster leaving and we have little chance of establishing the cause of the discrepancy. These cases
are discussed at the weekly case review held by the Network Support Resolution Team.

6. The discrepancy was not the Postmaster’s fault — for example, caused by suspicious assistant activity.

7. The Postmaster has mitigating circumstances where it would be reasonable to write an amount off their
balance.

8. Post Office have not met their obligations to the Postmaster.

POL00448365
POL00448365

3.2.2 Foreign Exchange Write Offs

All Foreign Currency Write offs are documented and authorised at the correct level and saved to the appropriate Team
site (for Bureau Finance), by product and period posted.

‘The Bureau Finance Team review all discrepancies (shortages and surpluses) in Remittances between Bureau Cash
Centre and POL branches (inbound and outbound)

Investigations carried out by the Bureau Finance team attempt to find the root cause of discrepancies for Postmasters,
debit balances can be written off as a minimum when:

1. The loss i:

2. The discrepancy cannot be established after an investigation, up to the value of £1,000.

3. The Post Office have not met their obligations to the Postmaster (e.g., Online Currency Guide not
maintained or up to date) up to the value of £1,000.

4. The discrepancy loss is subjective (c.g., Level of Defacement/mutilation of notes).

is £10 or less.

If the value of the loss is greater than £1k the case is referred to the Network Support and Resolution Team’s weekly
case review.

3.2.3 Branch Reconciliation Write Offs

The teams within the Branch Reconciliation team regularly review and monitor the age of the items within each GL (see
section 2)

1. Individual items may be written off where authorised managers within POL choose not to issue a
DEBIT transaction correction within their authority limit. (see section 7) e.g. -When the issuing of the
debit transaction correction is not deemed to be fair or reasonable to the Postmaster or Strategic
Partner. These cases are reviewed at the Branch Reconciliation weekly review meetings attended by the
Branch Reconciliation Operations Manager and the Head of Monitoring and Reconciliation.

2. Aged debit items over 45 days old may be written off, (the definition of an aged open item was
reduced from 60 days to 45 days in October 2022 as per the Network Transaction Correction policy).
These will be cleared unless there are valid reasons for the item to remain open (such as items aged due
to temporary branch closures which will resolve once the branch re-opens or the investigation is
ongoing in conjunction with the postmaster).

3. Clearing of debits and non-branch affecting credits which fall below the agreed low value tolerance
(see Appendix B) for the product (“maintained errors”) and the de minimis amount of the discrepancy.

4. The clearing of debits such as the vaulting of cash in branch. Each difference will be monitored and
investigated before written off.

The Retail teams should work with other business areas to minimise the volume and value of write offs, whilst ensuring
that this does not impact any Postmaster financially. The relevant team within the Branch Reconciliation team should
monitor the write off values and volumes for their products and work with their Finance Business Partner to make

financial provisions where required.

4. Write Off Journal Postings

NO write off posting is made to any GL without the proper authority process being followed and the correct
signatures obtained with documentation saved to appropriate Teams site (for Branch Reconciliation, as documented
in the Process Map REF BRT-GEN-02 Write Off V.05 or Postmaster Account Support). A sample of completed write
off forms and their associated write off postings are checked each month to ensure compliance by the Team

Managers. This control is documented and attested to on Service Now each month.
4.1 Individual Credits

The different types of unresolved credits (values held as a creditor in the Post Office balance sheet) and the
corresponding GL accounts that they should be posted to are detailed below:

A debit should not be posted to the Creditor Account without checking that there is a corresponding credit.

4.3 Provision/Budget Alignment

The budget holder should build in an expectation of potential write offs for any given financial year, this should this be
consistent with historic trends and known issues or investigations. If the level of write offs differs to that anticipated in
the budget, this should be reported to Financial Planning and Analysis as part of the forecasting process.

Provisions should only be created for known issues, where we reasonably expect a loss to occur, These should be
agreed with the Finance Business Partner, Head of Management Reporting & Accounting, the Financial Controller or
the Head of Financial and Technical Accounting, in line with the Post Office Accounting Manual.

Where write offs have been budgeted for, or have provisions, these should be posted to the same cost centre as the
-d.

provision or budget utili

Losses in relation to specific products can be written off to the product cost centre or BRT Cost Centre 100186
depending on agreement with product teams.

5. Low Value Write Offs

5.1 Debits

Debits which fall below the agreed low value tolerance (see Appendix B) for the product (“maintained errors”) can be
written off.

5.2 Credits

Maintained error postings for credits are not permitted as these can cause Postmaster financial detriment.

Relevant GLs (see section 2) will be monitored on a weekly basis to ensure maintained error postings for credits are not
‘occurring, a monthly attestation is carried out on Service Now to confirm this monitoring activity is taking place. Any
credits owed to the branch will be issued through the Transaction Corrections process, with the exception being from
GL1300 where the postmaster can be credited through the remuneration process.

The only exception to the above are credit write offs which do not affect branch. Use of the account text function when
posting to this account should be in the following format:

Standard narrative for non-branch affecting credits I Example
WB NBA + reason for clearing WB NBA re debit ref: XXXXXX *

« WBNBA - Write back of a previously posted debit where a corresponding credit has been identified or
payment has been received. The reference number will be the clearing document number for the previously
posted debit posting.

5.3 Write Off Tolerances

Write Off tolerances are applied to products as shown at Appendix B and any amendment to these levels must be agreed
with the Central Operations Director. Team Managers should collate data to support any proposed variation and submit
this data and proposed variation to the Central Operations Director.

Should the Central Operations Director agree the variation, the Write Off and Suspense Policy must be amended and
reissued.

6. Suspense Accounts

6.1 Scope

This section covers the following GLs:

GL 15356 — Branch Snapshot Suspense
GL 15351 Local Suspense

GL 19442 — Agent Creditor Suspense

GL 19443 — Customer Creditor Suspense

GL 19403 — Emergency Suspense

GL 15350 — Robbery & Burglary Suspense

GL 19428 — Unreconciled Processed Cheque Suspense (covered in section 4)
GL 19418 — Paystation Client Creditor Suspense (covered in section 4)

GL 19422 — ATM Surplus holding Account (covered in section 4).

6.2 Branch Snapshot Suspense (GL15356)

This is a holding account within the Branch accounts which allows Postmasters to investigate discrepancies that have
arisen within their branch during the trading period. Amounts are cleared using an automatic matching process against
corresponding opposite entries with any unmatched amounts rolled into Local Suspense during the completion of the
Trading Period. This account does not impact on Postmasters’ central accounts in the GL.

All amounts in this GL are fed directly from Horizon, so it is rare that amounts will need to be written off. Possible
scenarios include if the Horizon kit is destroyed by fire, flood etc. and adjustments cannot be made on the kit, or if'a
permanent closure has not been completed correctly. Any remaining debit amounts would be written off.

6.3 Local Suspense (GL 15351)

Branch discrepancies arising at period end are posted to this account. The balance is then either settled by cash or
cheque by the postmaster or the review or dispute icon is pressed, meaning the discrepancy is moved off Horizon onto
the postmaster’s central account into the GL1300.

All amounts in this GL are fed directly from Horizon, so it is rare that amounts will need to be written off. Possible

scenarios include if the Horizon kit is destroyed by fire, flood etc. and adjustments cannot be made on the kit, or if a
permanent closure has not been completed correctly. Any remaining debit amounts would be written off.

6.4 Agent Creditor Suspense (GL 19442)

This account holds surplus discrepancies that Postmasters dispute are owed to them. Prior to any surpluses being posted
into this account an investigation should be undertaken by a member of the Postmaster Account Support Team and

Write Off & Suspense Policy I Version 4.4 I Internal I 2024
Page 11 of 16
POL00448365
POL00448365

confirmation obtained and retained from the Postmaster that they do not want the surplus repaid to them. Amounts in
this account are written back to the P&L account after six years.

6.5 Customer Creditor Suspense (GL 19443)

This account holds amounts repaid to the Post Office from third parties due to issues identifying who the money is
owed to. Third parties include Santander and MoneyGram.

Prior to posting to this account, a detailed investigation into why the discrepancy has arisen must be undertaken. This
includes consultation with the relevant branch, if the branch has been identified, over the cause of the discrepancy to try
and identify the customer. If no resolution is found, a templated form should be filled in, explaining the reason for the
posting. This form should be reviewed and signed by the team leader and saved to the Customer Creditors GL19443
folder on the “BRT All Members” Teamis site, stored by FY/Period, product, and amount.

Use of the account text function when posting to this account should be in the following format:

Credits
Product Example
Bulk Cheques Non-POL Bulk Chg Payee xxxxxxxxxx
Bulk Chq Drawer xxxxxxxxxx
Bulk Cheques POL OR
Bulk Chq Reg xxxxxxxxxx
Unpaid Cheques Unpaid Chq *add company *add reference
Debit Card/MoneyGram Debit Card *SSK *Amex *MoneyGram *Date
Automated Payments AP *OP/UP ref *Cas number
PreOrder OP/UP ref *Cas number
Debits
Original credit in POLSAP Original credit in CFS
Text as for credits but prefixed with Text as for credits (items should be cleared
POLSAP down after posting)
POLSAP Bulk Chq Payee xxxxxxxxxxxx I Bulk Chq Payee xxxxxxxxxx

Amounts within the Customer Creditor Suspense account must be matched to an original entry prior to being repaid.

Amounts in this account are written back to the P&L account after six years. In other specific cases, where a suitable
ageing and customer claim profile can be established, a release for balances less than 6 years old can be made. These
specific policies require approval from the Financial Controller or the Head of Financial and Technical Accounting.

6.6 Emergency Suspense (GL 19403)

This account holds amounts that are posted by the branch. These entries must first be authorised by calling Branch
Support Centre and obtaining approval and a reference number. The value is held pending clearance, usually by the
receipt of a Transaction Correction.

Write Off & Suspense Policy I Version 4.4 I Internal I 2024
Page 12 of 16
POL00448365
POL00448365

This account is also used as an ad hoc holding account for customer credits by Moseley branch for the DVLA Fleet &
Bulk process. The amounts are rolled up monthly, as the transactions are completed daily, but rarely clear down
altogether, this makes the amounts more manageable, and this amount is then matched to the statement submitted by the
branch.

6.7 Robbery & Burglary Suspense (GL 15350)

This account holds amounts that are posted in branch for losses following any robbery, burglary, or theft.
The values are posted either by a Branch Assurance Advisor or by the branch (with approval from Branch Support
Centre).

A Transaction Correction is then issued to remove the amount from Robbery & Burglary Suspense which moves the
amount into GL 73590 Robbery, Burglary, Theft, Fraud Gains (Losses).

7. Financial Delegated Authorities

High value write-offs require second approval based on the below table:
