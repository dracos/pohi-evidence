target ranges which would be discussed with BiS at the end of

POLB 14/3 BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION

(a) The Board discussed the Business Transformation and the work being

undertaken by Alsbridge who are scheduled to present to the

February Board. The Board agreed that the initial design phase,

including defining the operating model, was crucial and supported the

appointment of an experienced interim to drive the transformation from

ACTION: CEO within the Business. Tim Franklin and Alasdair Marnoch offered their
support to find the right individual.

ACTION: CFO/ (b) The Board asked for clarity on the Business Transformation
Sue Barton objectives, milestones and timeline, including the impact of public
procurement, for discussion at the next Board meeting.

year. Sue Barton thanked the Board for their support and left the

POLB 14/4 TRADING PERFORMANCE

(a) The Board asked the Business to analyse its products by contribution

and to recommend to the Board a list of products which would be

ACTION: CFO deprioritised for the next 18 months, so providing opportunities to
reduced costs and focus on the areas of greatest return.

(b) Paul Brown, Head of Commercial Development, and Sarah Hall, Head
of Financial Control and Compliance, joined the meeting.

(c) Martin George explained the new role of Head of Commercial

commercial team’s resource with the product areas with greatest
opportunity and the focus on mails and financial services to support
the strategic plan.

(d) Paul Brown acknowledged the gap in the mails income in 2013/14
driven by Royal Mails price increases but reported that the recovery
plan was working and that he was confident in hitting the mails

desire to share business plans, promotions and targets.

(e) The Board discussed the Collections and Returns market and the
need to move with pace and sign up new contracts. Paul Brown
accepted that new retailers had taken longer than he would have liked
to sign contracts for the service. Several were now in the pipeline for
launch in the first quarter of 2014/15. He explained that the Business
were involved in Royal Mail's negotiations with potential clients and
with over 4000 branches now offering longer opening hours we were
in a strong position to sell the product.

(f) The Board asked the Business to focus on the Collections and
ACTION: Returns market with pace and vigour. A small increase in this market
Paul Brown share would lead to a material increase in revenue. Collections and
Returns had been identified during the separation negotiations with
Royal Mail as a significant opportunity which remained to be exploited.
In particular the Board asked the Business to work with Royal Mail to
strengthen the promotional material; develop the links into retailers’
websites; and improve the return labels sent to customers to ensure
that the Post Office option is more visible.

(g) The Board noted
(i) the impact of market changes and recovery actions on 2013/14
net revenue; and
(ii) the progress being made in arriving at a revenue target for
2014/15 which maintains the integrity of the strategic plan.

(h) Paul Brown left the meeting.

POLB 14/5 2014/15 BUDGET

(a) The Board received an update on the preparation of the 2014/15
budget.

(b) The CFO emphasised that the budget numbers aligned with the
Strategic Plan and gave the right growth trajectory for the future with
the exception of Government Services.

(c) The Board asked the CFO to consider ways to retain the contingency
at £15 million and hold the EBIT number to that in the Strategic plan.

(d) The CFO stressed that the budget already included £34m of cost
reductions but that the required new investment made it difficult to find
the additional contingency he would like. The Board asked the
Business to consider more radical cost reduction options and the
discipline of ensuring that any additional costs were always offset by
additional savings. The CEO agreed that the Business needed to look
again for a single quick solution which would deliver a cost

contingency.
(e) The income numbers in the budget were discussed and the Business
ACTION: FS was asked to accelerate work on Financial Services and set higher
Sub Committee targets for this area. The Financial Services Board Sub Committee

agreed to explore this further at their next meeting. A challenge was
also raised to test if there was further opportunity in the Mails area.

The CFO stressed the importance of the Business delivering income
growth to achieve the budget and EBITDAS.

(f) The Board discussed the Crown P&L and the breakeven target for
ACTION: CFO March 2015. It was noted that the budget would probably result in a
full year Crown loss but that the exit run-rate should be at break even.
This will be clear in the final budget presentation used for both the
Board and BIS to ensure that there is common understanding of the
position and the precise definition of ‘break even’.

(g) The Chairman emphasised the political importance of delivering the
agreed plan next year as this would give confidence to any new
government that the Post Office could be trusted to deliver its strategy
and funding agreement.

measure, the survey results and the work already underway to

(c) Mark Davies updated the Board on the segmented approach to
communications to ensure subpostmasters get relevant information for
their branches. He acknowledged that the most challenging aspect
was how to organise face to face communications with such a
geographically spread network, but it was still his aim to reach as
many people as possible through sales events and workshops.

ACTION: (d) The Board asked the Business to try to benchmark the response rate
Fay Healey with other organisation’s surveys and to consider setting a target for
responses rate.

(e) The Board were concerned that the survey showed that

could do more internal product promotions. Fay Healey explained that

Director, and Martin George, Commercial Director, to strengthen the
colleague offers.
