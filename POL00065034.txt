IN THE CROWN COURT AT STAFFORD T. 2004/7026

CARL ADRIAN PAGE

GRO

CASE SUMMARY

This Case Summary is supplied for assistance of the Court and the defence. It is not to
be regarded as a pleading or as limiting the way in which the Crown's case in put. All
available evidence will be relied upon.

1. The two Defendants are charged jointly with conspiring to defraud
Post Office Limited between March 2002 and January 2003 [Count 1].
PAGE alone is charged with theft within the same period of £

282,000, that being the deficiency found on audit [Count 2].

OUTLINE SUMMARY

2. PAGE was the Sub-Postmaster at Rugeley Post Office in

Staffordshire ["the office"]. At the office Bureau de Change facilities

POL00065034

Case Summary

were available on demand to customers. The Bureau de Change
facility is available at selected Post Office branches, and is provided
by Post Office Limited ["POL"] in a joint partnership with First Rate

Travel Services ["First Rate"], a part of the Bank of Ireland.

3. First Rate provides POL with the foreign currency which it requires.
POL's National Secure Stock Centre ["NSSC"] at Hemel Hempstead
orders volume currency from First Rate, which provides it to POL at
a wholesale rate at which it is booked into the NSSC's computer
system. Each morning First Rate sends by fax a daily exchange rate
sheet to all "on demand" offices and the NSSC: this stipulates the
buying and selling exchange rates to be used by Post Offices that

day for all Bureau de Change transactions.

4. The rates stipulated apply to transactions up to the value of £ 5,000
only. Transactions to a greater value than £ 5,000 attract a slightly
more favourable rate. In the event of a transaction valued in excess
of £ 5,000 being required by a customer, the office concerned is
required to telephone First Rate directly on a number given on the
sheet: First Rate will then provide the appropriate rate for the
requested transaction. It is at the heart of the Crown's case that the
only basis upon which a member of Post Office staff can effect
foreign currency transactions in excess of £ 5,000 is by making such
a call and applying the rate dictated by First Rate for that currency

on that date.

Case Summary

jis a businessman living in Rugeley. He is a Director of

RPX Recycled Plastics Ltd. In December 2002, H M Customs &
Excise made inquiries with the Money Laundering section within POL
because of concerns over the large volume of foreign currency
exchanges from sterling into Euros being transacted at the Rugeley

office. High-value cheques (usually over £ 50,000) drawn by

lon his company account had been made payable to

POL and accepted at the office as payment for foreign currency.

6. In brief summary, the evidence establishes that, during the period

covered by the Indictment, bought through the Bureau
de Change at PAGE's office over 11 million Euros. Had they been
transacted at the "over £ 5,000" rate, the sterling cost to him would
have been approximately £ 7.3 million. He was allowed by PAGE to
transact at rates of the order of 10% more favourable. The result was
that the actual sterling cost to him was approximately £ 6.7 million.
By the simple expedient of selling the same Euros, usually on the
same day, to branches of Thomas Cook in the Midlands, he was able
to amass approximately £ 8.2 million, a profit approaching £ 1 million
in less than a year for minimal effort. The loss to POL has been

calculated at £ 393,881.54 (based on wholesale rate comparison

alone) or £ 592,802.74 (with profit margin taken into account)'.

Case Summary

7. The Crown's case against PAGE is that he routinely permitted

“GRO } to buy Euros at exchange rates which were highly

favourable to the latter, which he knew were unauthorised by POL,
and which he had no authority to agree. The inevitable result was to
cause POL to make a fraction of the profit which it would otherwise
have done on each transaction or indeed a loss. Accordingly, POL
was defrauded by his unauthorised application of rates which he

determined for himself.

8. The Crown's case against I

jis that it is inconceivable
that he believed that PAGE had the authority to conduct foreign

exchange transactions with him at such advantageous rates:

e So far as is known, no-one else was permitted the benefit of such

preferential and unauthorised rates at the office

e Very large sums in sterling cheques were handed over by

to PAGE in exchange for Euros, usually before the

office officially opened in the morning

e They were exchanged back into sterling at significantly more
favourable rates, within hours and at other Bureaux de Change

operating on a commercial basis

e The huge profits he made for minimal effort, coupled with other

features later referred to, coupled with his acumen as a

businessman, can lead to no logical conclusion other than that

the two were involved in a joint enterprise to defraud.

9. The history can be summarised as follows:

(a) On about 110 occasions between March 2002 and January

2003;

bought round sums of Euros (up to 400,000

at a time);

(b) The majority of the transactions were made with Page and,
where they were not, they were transacted by staff acting on
his instructions, or being supplied with the exchange figure by

‘said by him to be that indicated by Page);

(c) On every occasion when Euros were bought, the exchange
rate applied bore no relation to the "over £ 5,000" rate set by
First Rate, but was significantly more favourable (generally

about 10% better);

(d) Page had no authority to apply anything other than the
exchange figure supplied daily by First Rate, however large

the size of the transaction, and he knew it;

(e) Page's account in interview that Retail Line Managers

["RLMs"] were aware that he allowed a preferential rate to

On numerous occasions, Batch Control Vouchers ["BCVs"]

were sent days after the transactions, instead of daily as they

should have been, thus allowin
at a profit and have the funds transferred to his bank in time

for the cheques to be met;

Page instructed one of his assistants, Miss BATEY, not to
send the bureau cheques on a daily basis (although he denies

that the intention was to delay the submission);

Page, at least since July 2002, must have inflated the Weekly
Cash Account, so as to reflect a sterling equivalent figure of

foreign exchange on hand much greater than was the case.

FINANCIAL BACKGROUND

10.

(a)

Staff at "on demand" Bureaux de Change order currency,

normally by fax, on a Form P5056? from the Cash Handling Centre at

Hemel Hempstead;

(b)

(c)

The currency is obtained from First Rate as described below;

Pouches containing not more than £ 2,500 worth of currency
are dispatched by priority mail guaranteeing next-day delivery;

if more than £ 2,500 is ordered, several pouches are sent;

Example is LGH/02 = EXX 195

11.

(e)

(a)

On receipt at the Cash Handling Centre, the currency is
entered at the wholesale rate, but then revalued using the

“buy" currency figure specified on a daily fax from First Rate;

On receipt at an office outlet, the volume and exchange rate
for the currency is booked in at the "buy" rate indicated on an

accompanying advice note.*

POL has an agreement with the Federation of Subpostmasters

to pay them £ 1.12 for each foreign exchange transaction

irrespective of value;

(b)

(c)

(d)

(e)

Currency is bought daily by POL from First Rate at a wholesale

rate;

On receipt by POL, currency is converted or re-valued from the
wholesale buy rate to the retail buy rate at which it is thereafter

“held”;

The difference between the "retail sell rate" applied to a
customer and the rate at which currency is hewed is known as
the "retail spread", which generates a revaluation figure at the

outlet office;

The true income generated by a customer sale is the

differential between the wholesale buy rate and the retail sell

ACCOUNTING PROCEDURES

12. (a) The operation of POL Bureaux de Change is governed by an

Operations Manual;°

(b) Each Bureau is equipped with a Forde Moneychanger which
performs currency conversions and has an accounting

function;

(c) The daily exchange rates should be entered into the Forde

Moneychanger before the office opens for business;

(d) IThe amounts and values of currency received from the NSSC
should be entered into the Forde Moneychanger, along with

the buy note and sell note rates;

(e) Currency transactions are also required to be entered onto the

office's Horizon computer system for accounting purposes.

13. In early December 2002, HUTCHINS® was establishing which POL
outlets ordered large volumes of foreign currency, with a view to re-
organising their deliveries. He noted that the Rugeley office showed

very large volumes of currency transferred in. He was not aware that

the office had any corporate customers, and when he spoke to PAGE
he queried the amounts. PAGE said that there was no mistake; that
the currency was for a corporate customer; but when asked which he
said it was not an official corporate customer but “one he had set up
locally."”. He was uneasy, and raised the matter with the money

laundering section.

HUTCHINS later produced a schedule LGH/05° which details the
wholesale rates applicable during the period covered by the

Indictment.

were cheques on hand valued over £ 200,000 which should not still
have been in the office. PAGE had been spoken to by telephone,

Thomas Cook outlets in and around Birmingham), realising a sterling

amount of £ 8,598,889.69.

Use of Schedules MP/3 and MP/80, together with information from

production of Schedule MP/4, the “Euros Purchase and Deposit

PATEL.* Among the matters which it illustrates is:

(a) that in most cases the same number of Euros purchased

(sometimes fewer) are sold the same day to other outlets;
(b) sometimes this occurred within hours;

(c) the sterling value of the Euros exchanged was credited
electronically to his company bank account the same day;

(d) the dispatch for processing of the cheques given in payment
was delayed by days (up to eight);

(e) the cheques in payment for the Euros would not have been
met had they been dispatched for processing on the day of
purchase, but were met because they were presented after the

proceeds of the sale transactions had been credited.“

Buy Notes transaction schedule MP/5* showed a larger number in

Making every allowance in favour of the Defendants, the consistent
pattern which emerged was that in every case throughout the period,

POL paid a greater amount in sterling (lower exchange rate) to First

Rate than

"} paid to Rugeley PO for the same amount of

Euros (higher exchange rate).

One final example illustrates the position, and shows that rather than
a lesser profit being made than would have been the case had the
proper rates been applied (as suggested by Page), POL was actually
making a loss even based on the wholesale rates it paid to First

He maintained the account that he believed that Page operated on a

reasons he was released from bail having agreed to attend

April 2003, and was further interviewed. He substantially repeated

Amongst other matters, he was asked about the following:

He was shown the four cheques given to him on 13" January 2003

agreed that he had been given that by {_

that the error notice from the Financial Division at Chesterfield

would arrive for weeks or months. He had made the decision to

e He denied that : GRO I had asked for such preferential rates:
he, Page, had decided upon them himself

The Crown say that he is a plausible individual. In essence, his
account is very simple: he admits having carried out the transactions
concerned (or having authorised them) at a rate which he knew he
was not permitted to apply. His motivation, so he says, was to
attract foreign exchange business to POL which would otherwise
have gone elsewhere: POL would make a profit; he would make only
a trifling £ 1.12 per transaction because of the scale of payment

applicable to bureau business.

Leaving aside entirely the evidence that:

(a) the preferential rates were directly against POL's instructions;

(b) his assistants queried the preferential rates;

(c) his assistants were instructed not to send the bureau cheques

off on a daily basis; and

(d) I the RLMs deny that they were aware of what he was doing,

the Crown suggest that this account is highly implausible. Although
POL made some profit, this was inevitably a small fraction of the

amount it would have made on the authorised levels of exchange, or
