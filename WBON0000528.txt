Notes from the beginning of the call below:

BEIS and UKGI are taking a more pro-active approach, two issues with this (1) in relation to piece of litigation they got
stung so worried about no surprises in POL lit; and (2) wish to protect public money and value for money so being
quite intrusive. Bill of £110m in compensation to supplier in nuclear procurement deal which has caused more
intrusive oversight.

UKGI had a framework document between themselves and investment bank and there was some merit in this.
Concept of framework document is helpful, but would need to develop into something which is workable and be signed
off by board in May.

Tom Cooper — question whether are we tying him down to an information sharing structure and signing a NDA? Not
NDA, director of company so has confidentiality undertakings already. Appointment letter has made issues with
confidentially. UKGI want Tom to tell UKGI what he wants to and not be

constrained in his ability to share information. Jane /Jean to work on appointment letter and set out specific protocol
on how types of information are shared.

From Tuesday Tom will be a director POL, UKGI don't want to restrict sharing of information of them and therefore
appointment letter to say that he is not restrained.

After CCRC material, deeply suspicious about ability of UKGI to control flow of information.

Subcommittee meeting on Monday evening (5-6) topics:

brief board committee on how run committee and when updates will be.

Will give board update on progress of lit as per WBD speaking notes.

Discuss protocol for engagement with UKGI and concerns with appointment of Tom Cooper.

Schedule meeting to review merits opinion

TOR - agreed.

Lit timetable and dates for future meetings — committee meetings going in diaries, want on around security for costs
Horizon Issues — got picture by June 18 but not have had the allegations by the other side.

Security for costs — might want some more information on difference between Costs Capping and costs budgeting.

UKGI protocol — chasing but important document and want committee to consider so discuss on Monday and would
be made available. Want something in writing which means give briefings a key point and when get merits on opinion
of case then want to talk them through it.

NDA not add anything to protocol and captures organisation generally when want to keep briefing to UKGI to a very
narrow audience. Write into protocol.

Alex Chishom is accounting officer for Post Office and accountable for spend in POL to minsters.
Contingency planning — ADVB work

Status update on CCRC

Subcommittee papers to be kept to a minimum and updates from committee to board to be verbal, Tom Cooper will be
updating UKGI which causes issues with directors duties.
