Section 1 Document Overview

This document is the user guide for the Service Management Portal which has been set up by Fujitsu Services Post Office Account in
order to provide an ongoing mechanism by which Post Office staff can be provided with up to date information about the
performance and condition of the Horizon system and also provides a mechanism by which Post Office and Post Office Account staff
can manage any major incidents which may occur

Section 2 System overview

The system is housed on an internet server, which is connected via the relevant security safeguards to the Fujitsu corporate network.
Access to the system is via a defined web address. Some sections of the system access databases which are all held on SQL
server systems. Whilst queries made on the databases are written into the html web pages, any actions which may change data in
the SQL servers are carried out by server-side code in the form of Java servlets. From the user point of view, the only access to the
data is via the web pages.

Note that this application is designed to run on a screen set to 1600 x 1200 pixels. The system will run on screen resolutions set
lower than this value, and provision has been made for screen resolutions lower than this value. The application has not been tested
at resolutions lower than 1200 x 1024, and running it at this level of resolution may cause some of the graphical elements to “jump”
to the next page.

Section 3 Logon and the Main Menu

When accessing the Service Management Portal, the first screen to be displayed is the logon screen shown in
figure 0.

You should note that the application loads a cookie into the local PC in order to remember the username of the last
person who logged on to the system from that PC, so after the first logon to the Service Management Portal, the
last username will always be displayed.

Type the username and password and click on the Logon button.
The application will determine at this point the size of the available screen and will adjust succeeding pages
accordingly, after which the main menu is displayed

The Management monitors present an up to date view of the live system from the service point of view as opposed to the monitors
generally used by the operational support teams, which tend to be based on individual servers in the Horizon system.

For the most part the monitors which are shown are simple displays, with no opportunity for user-interaction. Green indicates that the
service is running with no issues, amber indicates that there is an issue with the particular service but that it is running (although
possibly in a degraded state or with a loss of some resilience), red indicates a serious issue with the service which is causing it to run

in a degraded state, or not running at all
The meanings of the colour change for the monitors is slightly different for each monitor. The precise meanings are detailed below.

It should be noted that Tivoli is utilised to receive these alerts from distributed monitoring programs. Some alerts are configured to
trigger if they have not received a feed from the monitor within a specified time period. Therefore when a general communication
issue is evident it is common to see most of the monitors alert. Monitors showing Sites without communications use statistics which
may be up to one hour old and should be used as a guide rather than as a definitive statement of error

4.12 Map of sites without comms

Switches to a geographical display (see figure 4)

In this display, each red dot represents a Post Office which is not in communication with the data centre. Larger , red squares
indicate that more than one Post Office has lost communications to the data centre within the same geographical area — this is most
common during periods of severe weather when communications lines are disrupted

Positioning the mouse pointer over a county produces a pop-up message with the count of uncommunicative Post Offices in the are
and the total number of Post Offices in the area, for example “Powys — 6 of 204 down (2%)”

Clicking on the Local Exchange hot link displays additional details about all of the Post Offices which are connected to that local
exchange in the format shown in figure 7. Clearly, if all of the Post Offices connected to an exchange are showing red, then it is likely
that the problem is in the exchange itself, or at a higher level in the network hierarchy (possibly a BAS router). If the majority of the
Post Office connected to the exchange are green, then it is likely that the issue is at a more local level.

Section 5 Major Incident Management

In the event of a Major Incident, it is important that both Post Office and Fujitsu Services Post Office Account have immediate access
to the resolution progress, and that both organizations can see the relevant progress updates and the actions which have been
allocated to the resolution. In addition, the current mechanisms for handling the necessary paperwork involved in the final resolution
and sign-off of any incident are cumbersome and prone to excessive delays.

In order to resolve these deficiencies, the Major Incident Management system has been created to reside on the Service
Management Web portal.

The initial menu is shown in figure 11

When the “Update MIR” button is clicked, the system displays a summary line for each of the open incidents. The cursor changes to
a hand when placed over these summary lines. Clicking on the relevant incident will then open the screen which enables an update
record to be created. The format of the summary screen is shown in figure 15.

5.6 Update action

Unlike an update to a major incident, which is intended to be a snapshot of the state of the incident at a specific date and time and
therefore cannot be changed once created, actions are more fluid and can therefore be amended and deleted. When the update
action menu item is selected, a summary of the open major incidents is displayed — actions can only be created against open
incidents. The format of the summary screen is shown in figure 19

Section 6 Reports and SLTs

There are a number of reports which are delivered to the customer on a regular basis. It is the purpose of this section of the Service
Management portal to provide access to the most current version of these reports.

In addition, in this sections, are up to date figures for the performance of the system against the SLTs.
It should be noted, as displayed on the initial screen for this section, that the data in the SLT tracker is raw data direct from the
systems and has not been adjusted to take account of those factors which are beyond the control of Fujitsu for example file
deliveries which could not be made because the remote end was inoperable, Post Offices which have been closed, but for which the
closure notification has been delayed etc). Accurate figures are held in the SRB section.

within the failed calls record, there is a hot-link to the powerhelp system,and the details of the call can be viewed, the layout is shown
in figure 33

Care should be taken with this facility however. Powerhelp calls, once closed, and their details logged, are archived frequently to
save space. If the call has already been archived, then the hot-link to the call will simply produce a screen displaying a message that
the call details could not be found. The link to Powerhelp is also dependant on the end-user PC having access to the
Powerhelp system and may therefore not be available for some users.
