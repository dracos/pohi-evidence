jowever, the Final Balance for the stock unit concerned now has a

lappears on the balance, and one that the branch cannot enter

[amually.

1/04/04 09:21 uk951588

Information! The branch's initial error would cause a discrepancy
because of the change in exchange rates between declarations, and

Khat the currency would revalue itself accordingly.

But how £40,000 worth of dollars and Euros can lead to a

urrency revaluation worth over £200,000 in one week.

F} Response :

urrencies affected are Euros (Prod 5128) and US Dollars (Prod $129). On 7th
april the PM declared that she had zero amounts of both these currencies but
hen on the 8th April for some reason she started to declare excessive
amounts of these. For Euros she declared amounts of 36,070 BUR, then 360,070
EUR and finally 3,600,070 BUR and for US Dollars she declared 2,513,064 USD.
It wasn't until 10th April that she declared sensible amounts of 33,630 EUR
nd 28, 685 USD.

couple of us have been looking at the problem and trying to figure out how
to put things right but I'm afraid we're stuck. In the application event logs
se can see the ‘BDC Discrepancy Value too large to transact’ events which map
to the DDPs/DDNs with a zero SaleValue. We can also see the 'BDC Revaluation
failed to transact Product' events but we are unsure what these are telling

jis. We have a strong feeling that the bulk of the discrepancy is due to the

jay in which the Euro declarations were added to the system. The system coped
ywith the first gain (DDP) due to the 360,070 EUR declaration but then failed
with the next gain due to the 3,600,070 BUR declaration and failed with the

loss due to the 33,630 BUR declaration. Due to ‘Two hops up and one hop
Hown' the gains and losses don't seem to have managed to roughly balance out.

i") Response :
FAO John Moran (MSU) .

ihe spreadsheet put together by Martin from Development details the
discrepancies (DDNs/DDPs) that weren't handled due to being too large. For
uros, these were a £2, 354,029.06 DDN and a -£2,145,553.27 DDP which resulted
in a net discrepancy of £208,475.79. For US Dollars, these were a

1, 358,054.83 DDN and a -£1,363,572.44 DDP w resulted in a net
iscrepancy of -£5,517.61. The overall net discrepancy which wasn't accounted
for by the system was therefore £202,958.18 which would go some way to
explaining the £200,423.76 gain that the PM has reported.

lartin also states that he thinks "revaluation figures should really be taken
into account also but this is a business decision”. Perhaps you could talk
Mirectly to Martin to clarify exactly what he means here and what exactly
hese are. At the moment, we have a figure of £202,958.18 due to unhandled
discrepancies but dependant on ‘business decision’ I think he's implying that
taking revaluation figures into account will result in this figure increasing
x decreasing.

natever the final figure, its probably best that the MSU liaise with the
Post Office to get this sorted ‘manually’ by ‘error notice’ or however its
Mone.

Please could you take another look at this call as we've noticed a number of
egative value lines in the cash accounts, namely 99990001 (Balance Brought
Fwd), 99992072 (Table 5 Total) and 99991085 (Balance Due to Post Office).
These are most likely as a result of the large revaluations done on 14th
april, £214,661.07 RD of Euros and £14530.86 RU of US Dollars.

je need to know what actions need to be taken in order to put thin

right.

Can you take a look as soon as possible as a cash account has not been done
t the office since 22nd April. Not sure if this is because they are waiting
for a response from us.
