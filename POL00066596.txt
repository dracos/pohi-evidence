I am employed by Post Office Ltd as a Retail Line Manager and have been so for the past 5 years. My
role involves the supervision of a number of post office outlets within a defined geographical area,
ensuring that business objectives are met in the area of sales, accuracy, mystery shopper etc.

One office I am responsible for is Walton on Thames Post Office, 73 Hersham Road, Walton on
Thames, Surrey, KT12 1LN. On Friday 7" February 2003, I suspended and subsequently terminated the
contract for services of the Subpostmaster, Mr David Yates.

On Monday 10" February 2003 I attended Walton on Thames Post Office in order to tidy up the office
and clear out rubbish in preparation for the appointment of a temporary Subpostmaster. Whilst at the
office, I found three Horizon printouts relating to cash remitted out. I contacted Dave Posnett,
Investigation Manager, who requested that I send the printouts to him.

The first printout details an outward cash remittance of £330,000.00, dated 15/11/02, at 09:01 hours.
This printout is produced from the Horizon computer system when details of an outward remittance are
entered on the system. I now produce this printout as item EW/1.

The second printout details the reversal of an outward remittance of £205,000.00, dated 20/11/02, at
07:23 hours. The facility exists on the Horizon computer system to reverse certain transactions that
have previously been entered. This facility can be used, for example, if a customer returns and wishes
to cancel a transaction previously conducted, or if a Subpostmaster books in stock incorrectly which is
later noticed and the correct amount can be booked in. I now produce this printout as item EW/2.
