Dear Mandy

I refer to our telephone conversation on 9 January.
The hearing on 11 January went well for the following reasons:

1. Mr Castleton didn't make any headway with either of the witnesses he recalled. In fact, it
rebounded quite badly on him as Anne Chambers was able to explain again why there were
no I.T problems at Marine Drive that would have caused the errors.

2. It was a good opportunity to emphasise our case to the judge again. It became very
clear that the judge understands our position and he challenged the relevance of the points
Mr Castleton was seeking to make.

3. In terms of the lottery loss (just over £100), Mr Castleton tried to re-examine Ruth
Simpson about lottery receipts he had produced during the course of the trial after her first
cross examination. The court decided that he was too late and would not let him, since we
had not had the opportunity to cross examine him and his witnesses about those receipts
(they are the receipts that he says were found behind the post office counter which he says
Ruth Simpson ought to have put through the system.

4. The hearing also effectively ensured that Mr Castleton had one less avenue for any
application for permission to appeal.

I think we should get judgment within the next week or two and I will update you when I
hear anything further in that regard.

Kind regards.

Stephen Dilley
