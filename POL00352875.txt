Jane,

Please find attached the advice note on possible causes of action that could be advanced by prosecuted subpostmasters,
which we discussed earlier today.

The note was prepared back in July 2013 when Second Sight produced their first report, so it is very high level (there
have also been changes to the law of defamation). That said, I don’t think we have seen anything through the Mediation
Scheme which would suggest that a group action could easily be constructed around one of these causes of action.

I will however progress with Bond Dickinson an approach to giving us greater confidence in this regard.

Please let me know if you need anything else.

Kind regards, Rod

Rodric

Please find attached our note on the possible civil consequences of prosecutions / convictions collapsing due to problems
with Horizon.

This is just a very high level brainstorm at this stage - happy to look into any of these areas in more detail.
Kind regards
Andy
