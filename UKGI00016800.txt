Overall Risk Profile RA
If not managed successfully the risks - including commercial, strategic and stakeholder risks and
those linked to management appointments and remuneration - have the potential to significantly
impact the financial sustainability of POL and its ability to achieve policy objectives (e.g. transformed
Inetwork, reduced HMG funding)

Reputational Risk Profile I High.
There is significant political interest in the Post Office network and there are a number of clear policy
‘objectives. Risk is mainly centred on these areas, but it can also be linked to executive management
and remuneration issues. There is an ongoing POL litigation case which could potentially generate a
high level of negative coverage. The UKGI POL team are aware of the pressures and are working
collaboratively with Post Office Limited to manage the risks away.

The Performance and Risk Challenge Panel reviews risks across BEIS and decides what should
be escalated to ExCo level. It requires 1.5 hours circa every 6 weeks with circa 2 hours

I preparation. The panel is chaired by a Grade 3 and is made up of mainly Grade 5 participants I

BEIS Performance representing each directorate in BEIS. It is low-maintenance and a good opportunity for UKGI Jonathan ?
. BEIS to participate in discussions on risk at a departmental level. UKGI’s priority contribution is to September 2018 Ingram
and risk panel provide input on the BEIS areas on which we work (NDA, Post Office, New Nuclear, Airbus,

etc.). Our challenge / input is welcome on any other area. There are no obvious risks to UKGI I
being involved and there are benefits to us feeding in formally to the risk process through this
avenue.
