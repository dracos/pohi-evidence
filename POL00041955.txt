Please find attached your updated statement (+ a comparison showing the changes from the original version sent to
you). This includes your comments, further amendments from Counsel and some comments from me.

Once you've had a chance to review, it might be easiest for us to setup a cail to go through the remaining points.

Andy

Please find attached the latest version of my statement. This is still work in progress as I have some queries out with the
business. I will pick this up again on Monday when I should have the information I’ve requested. In the meantime I'm
returning to you as I have some comments for you/WBD that I’ve tracked — could you review and let me have a
response/update please. Where we've referenced other witness statements it would be helpful if I could see them. Is
this possible?

lhad intended to be on leave next week but in light of this being unfinished I am now in work on Monday and will pick
up for the rest of the week to finalise this statement ahead of submission deadline.

Thanks,
Angela

Angela

Please find attached the latest draft of your statement. All comments welcomed. This has been restructured from the last
version you saw, added a number of new sections and have cut out some material to make it shorter / where we have
considered material to be to far over the line of admissibility.

Rod — your comments also welcomed. In particular, there are some comments marked in green for your attention.

Kind regards
Andy
