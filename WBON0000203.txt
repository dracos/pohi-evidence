Hi Both

Please find attached a new Peak from Matthew that has just been sent over this morning. I don't believe it has been
disclosed and/ or is in Relativity although let me know if I'm mistaken. If not, can you please add this to the disclosure

tracker? I think it's likely one of the bug papers will refer to it.

Thank you

Katie

It looks like PC0273234 may have been raised at around the time the Peak extract was created in August
2018, so may not have been included. A copy is attached.

Hi Matthew

Thank you for your responses to this summary and confirming the ARQ request has been passed onto the security
team. I can see that you've sent over the correct Peak reference for the 2018 Peak. Can I just check this is a Peak
that WBD have been given? We can't seem to locate PC0273234 on Relativity so wanted to make sure but apologies
if this is something wrong our end.

Kind regards

Katie

Matthew,

We have prepared our summary on the Drop and Go Bug, copy attached, and should be grateful for Fujitsu's input.
We have also reached out to Post Office with a request to put us in touch with ATOS to investigate the outcome further
and have also asked Post Office to confirm whether or not a TC was issued here.
