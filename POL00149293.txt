Hi Mel,

Thanks for this. I think we should try and see Mr Iranca-Davies. Or at least write to him.

I presume BIS will come to us to draft an answer to his question.

Wales Online
Ogmore MP demands publication of report on post office computer glitch
http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/local-news/ogmore-mp-demands-publication-report-7966813

Local MP Huw Irranca-Davies has demanded that the Government publish a leaked report which is believed to be
highly critical of the Post Office’s handling of problems with the Horizon computer problem.

Hundreds of sub-postmasters all around the country have been left devastated financially, often losing tens of
thousands of pounds, because of problems they believe lie with the Horizon computer system which handles financial
payments in post offices.

Many sub-postmasters have also lost their post offices and careers, as well as their life-savings.

Over the last couple of years, the Ogmore MP has taken up the cases of three local sub-postmasters who have seen
their livelihoods ruined and their reputations tarnished.

Up until now, Government ministers have argued that there has been no major “systemic” fault with the computer
system.

But the BBC recently revealed parts of the leaked final report by investigators Second Sight, which alleges that
training for those without IT skills was inadequate when the new Horizon system was introduced, that equipment was
outdated, and that power cuts and communication problems made things worse.

Referring to the revelation, Mr Irranca-Davies said: “Surely this report now needs to be published, so that the facts are
out in the open.

“When people’s lives and reputations have been destroyed, it is indefensible to deny them the full story behind what
went wrong. The public will rightly ask what the government is hiding?”

One of the cases Huw has taken up involves an elderly couple who have lost their Post Office business and, in
addition, are nearly £20,000 out of pocket from losses they incurred directly from the Horizon problems.

They now face a very uncertain retirement, and even have the threat of possible future action by Post Office Ltd
hanging over them.

The politician has tabled a parliamentary question asking for the publication of the report, and is seeking a debate in
parliament, so that the hundreds of sub-postmasters affected can begin to put their lives back together again.
