Fantastic. Thank you Mike.

Please find attached your finalised statement for signature. We will enclose your diary entry as the exhibit.

Signing a statement of truth

The purpose of the witness statement is to provide written evidence to support Post Office's case that will be used as
evidence in court. The statement is a crucial part of the case, designed to show it in its strongest light. Yours focuses
solely on the audit of Mr Sabir.

You may be asked to attend court to explain the issues covered in the witness statement to the Judge, and be asked
questions on the evidence by the other side.

Awitness statement must have a "statement of truth". This is a statement confirming that the person making it believes
that the facts stated in the document are true. The penalties for signing a statement of truth without an honest belief in
the truth of the facts being verified are potentially severe. A person who makes a false statement in litigation in an
attempt to interfere with the course of justice will be in contempt of court, which is punishable by a prison sentence of
up to two years.

Once I send you the finalised witness statement, please could you:
carefully review your witness statement and any relevant documents referred to in it;
if you are satisfied with the content of the same, please sign the statement of truth;

email me a PDF of the signed witness statement; and

send the original signed witness statement to me at Womble Bond Dickinson, Temple Quay, 3 Temple Back East,
Bristol BS1 6DZ.

Thank you very much for your hard work in getting this over the line. I hope you have a lovely time on annual leave.

Hi Mandy

The statement is attached, along with a photo of my (rather scruffy) diary entry from the time.

Hope that’s ok,

Mike
