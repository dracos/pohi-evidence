Penny
I have just spoken to the solicitor dealing with this case. The question raised by
our barrister in his advice states with regards the Eleanor Nixon statement is-as
follows,

" The witness statement does not reveal a problem with Horizon's reliability but
rather a mistake that can easily be made with the layout of the screen. It may be
“hat the alleged layout problem is something which Fujitsu are aware of and has been
ectified. A copy of Mrs Nixon's statement should be forwarded to Fujitsu for their
comments. It should also be straightforward to ascertain whether or not Mrs Misra was
falling into the trap identified by Mrs Nixon. . The error described would presumably
create a cash shortage matched by an equal surplus elsewhere".

A response to this question by Fujitsu would be appreciated, however brief.
