I spoke to Ron about this again on Friday. He is going to send a letter to POL confirming the position.

Kind regards

This was a formal request and needs to be dealt with formally by second sight. As BAQC advised it can then be
reconsidered. If then Second sight still feel uncomfortable dealing with our request for disclosure, we may ask
them to provide a witness statement to clarify their position on disclosure.

Subject: Second Sight - disclosure of information to POL on prosecutions [BD-4A.FID20472253]

Chris, Belinda

I've spoken to Ron.

He has no information directly connected to the prosecution of Darren King. However, he does have information which
may generically relate to issues raised in King's application (eg. King raises a complaint about ATMs and SS has lots of
anecdotal evidence about problems with ATMs).

Ron's view is that the information SS holds about these generic issues will either (a) already be held by Post Office or (b)
be communicated to Post Office in the course of the Scheme as other SPMRs have raised similar issues to King. As
such, there is no need for a separate disclosure of information at this stage.

Ron is going to write a response to Post Office along the above lines. | have gently warned him that he needs to be
careful about anything he says in relation to criminal prosecutions as such comments are under heavy scrutiny and will
have consequences.

In short, he is now more comfortable with how to handle this situation. Hopefully, SS' letter will close down this issue.

Kind regards
