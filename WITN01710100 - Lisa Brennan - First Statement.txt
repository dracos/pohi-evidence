POST OFFICE HISTORY

9. | became a counter clerk, at Childwall Valley, when | was 16 years old. |
worked there until | was 21. When | left, | was an officer in charge.

10.1 then began working for the Crown Post Office. At first, | was a ‘floater’ and |
could be sent anywhere to work. | didn’t mind this and | enjoyed it. | worked at
a number of different Post Offices all over Liverpool.

11.|In 1995, | ended up at the Huyton Post Office working as a counter clerk.

12.1 enjoyed working in the Post Office and it was always my intention to stay
there until my retirement.

13.| had won awards and earned bonuses. It was good money and a good
pension.

CRIMINAL ALLEGATIONS AND ANY PROCEEDINGS/CONVICTION
15. The Horizon system was installed between 1999 - 2001. | was given no
training from the Post Office.
16. Practice makes perfect was the way we looked at it.
17. There were approximately ten members of staff working at the Post Office at

that time.

Page 2 of 15
18. We all had log in details. There was another female member of staff who had
the same initials as me, LB. This caused problems when we needed to
determine who was who, and who was doing which transactions.

19.All of us made mistakes but there was never an expectation that we had to
pay the shortfall. It would just roll over to the next day.

20.On 2 June 2002, the auditors arrived at the branch. This was not unusual,
they often did. However they usually looked at the branch as a whole due to
its size. They never looked at individuals.

21.They did a full audit of the branch and found a mistake in my balancing. | had
never been in the spotlight before. | was good at my job and this was a shock.

22.| understand that a shortfall of approximately £3,000.00 was found.

23.1 was called into a room and interviewed. | was told | could take a friend with
me, which | did, but they would not be able to contribute. | had no legal
representation.

24. The interview was conducted by two men. One of the men was Steven
Bradshaw. | cannot recall the name of the other man.

25. The interview felt like an eternity. | was so intimidated and the experience was
awful. They were insulting throughout and made unprofessional comments
about my weight and my hair. This was horrible. | felt | was in a no-win
situation.

26. After the interview, | was suspended and told to leave there and then. My
contract with the Post Office was terminated.

27.1 did not know what to do so | just got on the bus.

next day with my parents and other family members, so | knew | could stay
there.

could not cope with that.

30.On 24 December 2002, | received my summons to appear at court. | was still
living at my mum’s house at this point.

31.1 was distraught. To receive the summons at all was devastating, but to do so
on Christmas Eve was incredibly upsetting. | just wanted to escape the past
few months at Christmas time but | wasn’t even allowed to do that.

33.1 instructed EAG solicitors and they instructed a barrister, Mr Simms, to
represent me. | relied on his advice.

would then be transferred to the Crown Court.

y; with me for support.

would | plead anything different.

Page 4 of 15

reached a verdict, so we had to come back the following day.

42.On the final day of the trial, | had to say goodbye to!G She went to school
rather than coming with me. She knew that there was a chance that | might
not be coming home.

43.| was very open with her. | told her that if | was sent to prison, | was never
coming home. | could not cope with that and | would end my life.

44. It was heartbreaking to have to have such a conversation and to say goodbye
and leave /GRO}to go to school, it was unbearable. She was only 6.

45. | was found guilty.

46. It was a split verdict and Judge Phillips said that he could not understand how
| was found guilty by some of the jury and not by others.

47.| was convicted of stealing either £3,000.00 or £6,000.00. | was in total shock.

48. Even the Court Clerk was in tears.

49. The Post Office requested an order for their costs and Judge Phillips told
them to “add a penny on the cost of a stamp” as they would get nothing from
me.
