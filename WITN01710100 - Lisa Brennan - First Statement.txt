7. My life was going well and everything was normal. In 2002, everything fell
apart.
8. Today, I am rebuilding my life. I have a new partner; I am fit and well and I am

looking towards the future.

POST OFFICE HISTORY

9. I became a counter clerk, at Childwall Valley, when I was 16 years old. I
worked there until I was 21. When I left, I was an officer in charge.

10.1 then began working for the Crown Post Office. At first, I was a ‘floater’ and I
could be sent anywhere to work. I didn’t mind this and I enjoyed it. I worked at
a number of different Post Offices all over Liverpool.

11.IIn 1995, I ended up at the Huyton Post Office working as a counter clerk.

12.1 enjoyed working in the Post Office and it was always my intention to stay
there until my retirement.

13.I had won awards and earned bonuses. It was good money and a good
pension.

14.1 was happy with my job.

CRIMINAL ALLEGATIONS AND ANY PROCEEDINGS/CONVICTION
15. The Horizon system was installed between 1999 - 2001. I was given no
training from the Post Office.
16. Practice makes perfect was the way we looked at it.
17. There were approximately ten members of staff working at the Post Office at

that time.

Page 2 of 15
18. We all had log in details. There was another female member of staff who had
the same initials as me, LB. This caused problems when we needed to
determine who was who, and who was doing which transactions.

19.All of us made mistakes but there was never an expectation that we had to
pay the shortfall. It would just roll over to the next day.

20.On 2 June 2002, the auditors arrived at the branch. This was not unusual,
they often did. However they usually looked at the branch as a whole due to
its size. They never looked at individuals.

21.They did a full audit of the branch and found a mistake in my balancing. I had
never been in the spotlight before. I was good at my job and this was a shock.

22.I understand that a shortfall of approximately £3,000.00 was found.

23.1 was called into a room and interviewed. I was told I could take a friend with
me, which I did, but they would not be able to contribute. I had no legal
representation.

24. The interview was conducted by two men. One of the men was Steven
Bradshaw. I cannot recall the name of the other man.

25. The interview felt like an eternity. I was so intimidated and the experience was
awful. They were insulting throughout and made unprofessional comments
about my weight and my hair. This was horrible. I felt I was in a no-win
situation.

26. After the interview, I was suspended and told to leave there and then. My
contract with the Post Office was terminated.

27.1 did not know what to do so I just got on the bus.

Page 3 of 15
28.1 went to my Nan’s house. My daughter,! GRO! was due to go on holiday the
next day with my parents and other family members, so I knew I could stay
there.

29.My Nan stayed with me. I made a point of not returning to the family home. I
could not cope with that.

30.On 24 December 2002, I received my summons to appear at court. I was still
living at my mum’s house at this point.

31.1 was distraught. To receive the summons at all was devastating, but to do so
on Christmas Eve was incredibly upsetting. I just wanted to escape the past
few months at Christmas time but I wasn’t even allowed to do that.

32.1 was summonsed to appear at Liverpool Magistrates Court.

33.1 instructed EAG solicitors and they instructed a barrister, Mr Simms, to
represent me. I relied on his advice.

34.1 was advised by! GRO {to plead not guilty and he said that the case
would then be transferred to the Crown Court.

35.1 decided to plead not guilty. I was only there for an hour. I took my stepdad,

y; with me for support.

36. The case was then referred to Liverpool Crown Court.

37.On 2 September 2003, it was listed for a three-day trial.

38.My mum and /¢ my stepfather, came with me each day.

39.I had to take references from people who I worked with for the Judge to
consider.
40.I maintained my not guilty plea throughout. I had done nothing wrong, so why

would I plead anything different.

Page 4 of 15
41.On the second day of the trial, the jury were sent home as they had not

reached a verdict, so we had to come back the following day.

42.On the final day of the trial, I had to say goodbye to!G She went to school
rather than coming with me. She knew that there was a chance that I might
not be coming home.

43.I was very open with her. I told her that if I was sent to prison, I was never
coming home. I could not cope with that and I would end my life.

44. It was heartbreaking to have to have such a conversation and to say goodbye
and leave /GRO}to go to school, it was unbearable. She was only 6.

45. I was found guilty.

46. It was a split verdict and Judge Phillips said that he could not understand how
I was found guilty by some of the jury and not by others.

47.I was convicted of stealing either £3,000.00 or £6,000.00. I was in total shock.

48. Even the Court Clerk was in tears.

49. The Post Office requested an order for their costs and Judge Phillips told
them to “add a penny on the cost of a stamp” as they would get nothing from
me.

50.1 had no legal costs to pay.

51.1 had been charged with 32 counts of theft, and I was convicted on 27
accounts.

52.I received a 6-month sentence, suspended for two years.

53.1 was numb, but I knew I was going home.

54.1 couldn’t believe that I had been convicted of an offence that I did not commit.

55. Throughout my career, I had shown nothing but loyalty, hard-work, and

dedication to my Post Office branch, and in return I was branded a criminal.

Page 5 of 15
56.1 was so upset and ashamed.

93.1 was very close to my brother-in-law who was a policeman. I was so
ashamed that I could not tell him about what was happening until the week

drug activity. It was not a place to bring up!

wage, helping where I could. I was there a year or two until! thad to

own. I could not use childcare as a reason not to get a job.

115. I then went to work for B&M and did the night shifts. I hated working there

Page 11 of 15
WHAT EFFECT DID THESE ISSUES HAVE UPON YOUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH
YOUR FAMILY, FRIENDS, COLLEAGUES AND LOCAL COMMUNITY?

130.As I have said, my marriage broke down.

131.After my conviction, my dad became ill, and I was too scared to take time off
work to care for him. This was because of my experience with the Post
Office and the fact that I did not want to be accused of not doing my job
properly.

132.My Dad needed to be taken to appointments, but I didn’t feel comfortable
doing this. He died a few years ago of dementia and cancer. I feel I lost this
time with him.

quashed. Although they believed in me, in the eyes of the law, I was a
convicted criminal.

138.1 lost touch as I wouldn't let anyone into my life. I was so ashamed and
embarrassed by my conviction.

conviction and keeping tabs on me online.

Page 12 of 15
140. I have not had a relationship until recently, when I met my partner, and we
are now engaged. I was always worried about telling him about my past, but
when I did, he answered with “so what” which was a massive relief. He did
not care about the past.

141.1 began running to help me cope. I ran to forget that I was a criminal. I was a
size 18, but I lost weight and I began to run every day, completing charity

runs and 10ks.

CONCLUDING REMARKS

153. The whole situation with the Post Office has had a significant impact on my
well-being and self-confidence and has caused myself and my family so
much hurt over the years.

154. Despite my reservations, I lodged my case at the Criminal Case Review
Commission (CCRC).

155.My case was accepted by the CCRC and my conviction was referred to the
Court of Appeal in March 2021.

156. The Post Office confirmed that they would not object to my conviction being
quashed and it was quashed on 23 April 2021.

157.1 was still embarrassed by my conviction, and although I wanted to go to
court and be on television, I didn't dare in case my conviction wasn’t
overturned. I feared that I would then be on TV and lose my job. I kept what
was going on a secret and I could not even ask for time off work to attend
court.

158.1 only told my employers about the court case once my conviction was
overturned. I had been off with stress for months, but they did not know the
cause of it.

159.1 can now get on with the rest of my life. I regret not seeking medical help
earlier from my doctor, but I didn’t go because I was a criminal and didn’t
deserve help.

160.I kept everything bottled up and a secret for 19 years.

Page 14 of 15
161. It was me andi against the world and I was very angry. For my own
sanity I had to write it all down.
162. It is only now, after starting the medication that I have begun to feel better

and I now have a spring in my step.
