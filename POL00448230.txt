Retail Performance Dashboard Summary Period 3

The dashboard has been developed to provide a summary of key metrics with comparisons:

The current month's performance
The average year to date figure (adjusted for 5-week periods where applicable)
The performance seen in the same month last year

The RAG status is based on parameters agreed with each business area, based on currently used targets/Service Levels or the average previous year to date metrics.
Some areas have no RAG as they are not targeted areas, so appear in grey for noting only.

New process to include an additional contact — we have implemented a system generated
prompt at the 7-, 14- and 21-days stage. Following the first full month after
implementation, we saw a decline in the time taken for Potential New Postmasters to
submit the financial assessment. This dropped from 50 days in P2 to 39 days in P3 (-11
days) This is also 9 days quicker than the average of 48 days over the previous 6 months.

Inaugural Feedback Committee — The Feedback Committee met for the first time on 27%
June. This meeting will be now held on a monthly basis and will include various stakeholder
on a quarterly basis or when required.

Development of a report to identify the origin of classroom referrals which can be split
between those generated internally by the training team and those within the Retail
Line — this is now complete and used regularly to update the Retail field team.

Support provided to Strategic Partner Team to manage program of eLearning and
classroom training for c. 160 delegates — Program of classrooms for One Stop running
from March to early September. Around 80 delegates had attended up to May, and a
similar number is expected through to September. This is helping to drive utilisation. We
are also running training for area managers and business support managers which is also
having a positive impact on classroom utilisation.

Note counters ~ Post introduction (P12 23/24 - P3 24/25) the note counter trial branches
have shown a significant improvement in tracked metrics when compared to non-pilot
branches. Some key highlights include:
+ There has been a cash transaction correction volume reduction of 49% in pilot
branches vs 4% decrease in non-pilot branches (control group)
+ There has been a counterfeit note reduction of 91% in pilot branches vs a 27%
decrease respectively in non-pilot branches (control group)

Auto stock rem in — Engagement has begun with the 7 branches, due to take part in the
September 2024 pilot. User and business acceptance testing is complete. The path clearing
plan has been developed. This will include a stock migration support visit at 4 of the pilot
branches, and these have been scheduled.

Deep dive into reasons for cash related causes ~ Because 75% of TCs in P3 were caused
by cash errors, some work has been started on understanding the specific reasons for
these, The outputs should drive more detailed reporting in this area.

Focus on open items relating to cash ~ Full team is back in place, following sickness, and
backlog is on schedule to be cleared,

Design a Quality Assurance Framework and a Cause Analysis framework - This planned
improvement has developed from sharing root cause into the development of QA and cause
analysis frameworks and therefore we have updated the completion date to next March.
We are currently recruiting an additional Operations Manager to focus specifically on these
areas.

Discrepancy Dashboard: following implementation of the updated case management
process in Microsoft Dynamics, the dashboard has now been created and reviewed. This
provides the team with the ability to track discrepancies raised in the period through to
resolution.

Commentary
The overall timeline for P3 has
increased by 5 days vs P2 to 118.5
days (still within the 120 day KPI),
despite a 11 day reduction in the
time taken from the original link
being sent out to FA submission -
suggesting we are now seeing the
benefit of the additional
reminders/communication put in
place last month.

The main driver of the overall
increase is an additional 9 days it is
taking for financial assessments to
be processed due to a 30%
increase in applications, alongside 1
of the 2 assessors being on sick
absence.

Increases of c. 2 days each were
returned in each of the other areas
- back in line with P1 performance.
Customer Satisfaction scores
remain high, with 16 of the 18
responses received YTD being
positive, returning overall
satisfaction of 88% and all
categories scoring >86% for the
third successive month.

We have seen a decline in
responses (2) as a result of no
longer sending out requests via
SMS. 9

Commentary

Only 1 of the Outward discrepancies was as a result of an error at the cash centre

(£2000 - surplus). The improvement plan implemented in P12 has continued to

reduce cash centre packing errors. The other 13 discrepancies are all shortages (£700).

Four discrepancies reported by branches (£397 in total) are being investigated
(all coin).

The slight increase in Inward surpluses, shortages and counterfeits reflects the
increased values being returned in P3.

POL00448230

Commentary:

* SLA performance in the new process was
above target with 87% resolved within 20
days. Overall performance was impacted by
cases resolved in the legacy process that were
in an aged position resulting in a combined SLA’
of 67% for P3.

Investigation cases resolved by cause:

* 92% of cases closed YTD relate to inaccurate
accounting (e.g. not performing an accurate or
physical count of cash or stock). Work
continues under Operational Excellence to
support branches.

Open PAST Cases:

* Cases investigated and sent to the Postmaster
Account Support Team have increased, the
majority of these are waiting on TCs to be
issued before they can be resolved. The new
ways of working has resulted in decreased
volumes, cases are moved into the Investigation
team after 42 days.

Network Monitoring and Branch Assurance Support

Network Monitoring pro-actively supports Postmasters, focusing on reducing losses and driving compliance.

A risk model highlights branches failing to perform compliance tasks, such as completing a Trading Period or failing cash declarations. If a branch is flagged in any
category, Network Monitoring will create a case and look at all areas of compliance at that branch.

If the results indicate that the branch needs support, the most suitable support will be offered (i.e. a call to coach the branch on the issue, a support call or visit or
a branch assurance visit).

Two suspensions in the period, one where there was an admitted use of Post Office funds and one where operational irregularities had been identified following an
investigation into a branch discrepancy. The total discrepancy shortfall across these two branches was £893,414.

‘An additional metric has been added to illustrate the average length of suspensions open at the end of the period, one figure including those postmasters who have been
charged with criminal offences and one figure without it. Not included in these figures is an additional suspension that relates to a suspended postmaster who was also a
claimant under the GLO. Post Office is currently working with the Postmaster's legal representation to reach settlement, however this is tied up with wider obligations under

the GLO Settlement Deed and so a conclusion has been delayed.
