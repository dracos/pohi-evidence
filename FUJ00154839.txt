Hi Anne
I'm in the office today and have started retrieving these days.

Question - you have three events highlighted in light blue (Tonbridge 6 Dec 07 and 12 Dec 07, Craigpark 27
Dec 07) do you need messagestores for these also?

Kind regards
Penny

Penny, I should have said - the spreadsheet attached to previous mail shows which branches/days
are required.

Hi Anne

Thanks for the update. I do not have any of the riposte messages saved so all will need to be re-
retrieved, but hopefully this will be just odd days. Let me know what you need when you can.

Kind regards

Good morning,

I'm working from home today, but I did complete most of the event checks on Friday: There
are 6 or possibly 7 events which I cannot immediately rule out and so we will need the
messages for the day to seee if anyone was logged on and what they were doing (unless you
still have the Riposte event/transaction logs available in which case I'll look at them first).

This doesn't mean that the 4/5 branches are likely to have had the problem, just that Lcan’t
rule it out yet.

It should only take about half a day to check all the message extracts, once available, so I
think actually getting the extracts is the bit that will take time now (especially as you aren't in
the office!)

There's no point progressing with the two ringers (141832 and 005948 I think) although my
check did trap them.

Hi Anne
Hope all is well with you

I've received an e-mail from POL on Friday chasing for status on this exercise. Can you give me
an estimate for completion?

That said, I have been unable to get into the office today because of the weather conditions and
that may also be the case for you. Forecasts are that tomorrow may be just as bad.

Kind regards
Penny

Mik, Steve,

Most if not all of these will be caused by Riposte checkpoints failing to be written (a
benign failure), which I should be able to confirm in most cases from the SSC event
archives. This is a quick check - a few minutes per event/day. If I can't confirm it, then
Penny will have to get the messagestore back for the day or possibly longer, and I'll
have to look in more detail - but I hope there won't be many instances for which this is
necessary. I'll reassess the scale of the job once I've done the first step.

Where the cause is the checkpoint failing to write, there are two background processes
colliding, and nothing to do with what the clerk is (or isn't) doing at the time.

Anne,

I don't know how long each of these takes.

if you could give me some idea of the timescales, then, if necessary, I will allocate some
help for you.

Just following up the audit issue from a couple of weeks past.

There are 27 instants on the list, 2 of which were the original ones, interestingly
only 10 sites.

I've had a chat with Mik, to get authorisation for you to do this and he is ok, albeit a
little concerned around the amount of time it will take.

Whilst it is urgent, I appreciate that you have a tonne of other stuff to, so as and
when you can fit these in.

Would also be interested in understanding, is there a conversation that we need to
have with the PO’S?, since there are a number that have frequent occurrences.

Thanks

Steve

I have compared your ARQs with the event data constrained as follows:

1. Only the specific Riposte timeout event

03/02/2009
03/02/2009

FUJ00154839
FUJ00154839

2. Events between 1st May 07 and 30th Nov 08 inclusive
3. Events logged between 19:00 and 19:10

4. Events logged by Counter 1
I have added a worksheet into your original spreadsheet with the results - 27
matches. Can you confirm that your ringers are in there.
