I, Colin Burston will say as follows:




    1. 1 am a former employee of Post Office Limited and held the position of Contract

       Advisor prior to my retirement in 2019.

    2. This witness statement is made to assist the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry (the

       "Inquiry") with the matters set out in the Rule 9 Request dated 25 August 2023

       (the "Request'). I have been asked to set out a summary of my career and

       qualifications prior to joining Post Office Ltd. The request also asked that I

       address a further 41 questions within my statement.

    3. Prior to joining Post Office Limited I can confirm that after leaving school I held various

        positions within organisations namely, Bristol City Council, Bristol Omnibus and C

                                                                                     WITN09450100




   Reed Ltd. I have 5 `O levels' and the roles undertaken at these organisations were

   Accounts Clerk, Bus Conductor and Furniture Remover.


4. In respect of Post Office Limited. I can confirm I joined as a Postman in 1977 and

   progressed to various roles Counter Clerk, Branch Manager, Business Service

   Manager, Retail Network Manager, hybrid role of Performance Advisor/Contract

   Manager, Contract and Service Manager until the role changed in 2006 to Contract

   Advisor.


5. Counter Clerk, I worked in various Crown Post Offices from 1980 until 1984 when I

   was promoted to Branch Manager.


6. Branch Manager, from 1984 until 1999 I managed various Post Office Crown Post

   Offices. I was responsible for all aspects of running a Post Office branch from

   recruitment, quality of service, branch losses and gains, discipline, customer service

   and the wellbeing of staff.


7. Business Service Manager, from 1999 until 2000. This team was set up to design

   processes to assist in the smooth roll out of Horizon in branches. My specific input

   in the role was to look at the processes designed and give feedback from an

   operational viewpoint, based on my experience of counter and back-office operation

   in branch.


8. Retail Network Manager, I was asked to cover this role in 2000 on a temporary basis

   to cover long-term sick absence. My responsibilities included recruitment of

   subpostmasters (SPMs), helping SPMs who were having problems balancing under

   the manual system and with the introduction of Horizon supporting their first balance.

   I would also be there for intervention visits if requested by a Subpostmaster (SPM)

                                                                                    WITN09450100




   for various reasons including problems with customers, general problems where

   additional training was requested and dealing with cases of sick absence and death

   in service. Following a business reorganisation circa 2001, my role changed to a

   hybrid one of Performance Advisor and Contract Manager. The role of Performance

   advisor was similar in responsibilities to that of the Retail Network Manager. The

   Contract Manager responsibilities are covered below paragraph 9.


9. Contract and Service Manager, I am not sure of the date, but it was around 2004 that

   there was a change of roles, and I had a team of 2 Intervention Managers reporting

   to me, these were Simon Smith and Jon Lewis. I would deal with all aspects of the

   Contract for Services. If there was a problem at a branch the Intervention Managers

   would carry out any visits to branches which were required. The Intervention

   Managers would also assist me with recruitment interviews. In 2006 the role changed

   again to Contract Advisor, and I was responsible for approximately 1000 sub—Post

   Office branches dealing in all contractual matters including recruitment, holiday pay

   (substitution payment), issues around opening hours, resignations, customer

   complaints, additional training, outstanding debt, failure to comply with business

   standards and suspensions. I eventually retired in September 2019 from the Post

   Office following heart surgery.


10. I have been asked what my role entailed regarding the drafting of the terms of the

   SPM contract, my role in advising the Post Office on changes to the SPM contract,

   my role in determining when a SPM contract would be suspended and terminated

   and my engagement with a SPM to explain the terms of their contract. In my role as

   Contract Advisor, I had no input into drafting the terms of the SPM contract or

   advising the Post Office on changes to the SPM contract. My role would be to

                                                                                      WITNO9450100
                                                                                    WITN09450100




   determine whether a SPM had breached their contract following any issues raised

   from other Post Office departments, customer complaints or audits. In determining if

   a SPM should be suspended or have their contract terminated a case summary

   would need to be completed giving the rationale for any recommendation which

   would need to be agreed and signed off by the Head of Contracts South in my case.

   At recruitment interviews a brief synopsis of the Contract for Services would be

   explained and the applicant if successful advised to read the Contract for Services

   for themselves to fully understand the scope of the contract and what their

   responsibility would be to ensure that their Post Office branch was operating within

   the Contract for Services.




11. I have been asked to review the contractual liability of SPMs, my understanding of

   such and have reviewed the following documents which were provided to me prior

   to responding to these questions. POL00088904, Losses & Gains policy within

   POCL agency network, in particular paragraph 3.1. POL00086845, Post Office Ltd,

   Security Policy: Accounting losses policy for agency branches, particularly sections

   1 and 3. POL00088867 Security Policy: liability for losses policy for agency branches

   in particular sections 1 and 3. POL00030562 Post Office Ltd Losses Policy —

   overarching (branches') in particular section 2.       My understanding of the

   contractual responsibility of SPMs for shortfalls has always remained the same

   as in the Contract for Services Section 12 paragraph 12, Document

   POL00083780 refers; extract from Post Office Counters Ltd., Subpostmasters

   Contract POLO0003858 it says your Contract for Services states the SPM is

   responsible for all losses caused through his own negligence, carelessness or

                                                                                WITN09450100




   error and also for losses of all kinds caused by his Assistants. Deficiencies due

   to such losses must be made good without delay.


12. 1 have been asked how the responsibility of employees for losses within the

   Crown Offices differed from the responsibility of SPMs. I have reviewed

   documents POL00083982 Losses in the crown Network and POL00088124

   Losses and Gains Policy Crown Office Network and have responded based

   primarily from my time as a Branch Manager in Crown branches and my role

   as a Contract Advisor. The main difference between the Crown Office network

   and SPMs was that Crown office staff who were directly employed by the Post

   Office would be subject to the Code of Conduct for losses and gains where

   SPMs were subject to their Contract for Services and responsible individually

   for losses and gains.


13. I have been asked what my understanding of the circumstances in which a

   SPM's Contract for Services would be suspended and terminated following the

   identification of losses and what discretion, if any, did individual contracts

   advisors have. This is addressed in paragraphs 13 and 14. My understanding

   was that unexplained losses as well as admissions of using Post Office Ltd

   cash would be subject to suspension pending investigation into the loss. There

   was an element of discretion if the loss could be explained but this would need

   to be agreed with the Head of Contracts who would need to understand the

   rationale behind the reason not to suspend.


14. Reasons for termination would include admissions of using Post Office Ltd cash

   for their own use, security breaches that the SPM was not prepared to address,

   running prohibited businesses from their premises and any other issues that

                                  Page 5 of 20
                                                                                WITNO9450100
                                                                              WITN09450100




   clearly breached the Contract for Services. The Contract Advisor would have

   the opportunity for discretion if the issue could be addressed but they would

   need concurrence from the Head of Contracts to apply discretion. There was

   no document rather a discussion via telephone or email between Contract

   Advisor and Head of Contracts.


15. 1 have been asked to describe the procedure followed when deciding as to

   whether to suspend/terminate a SPM's contract. The procedure would be to

   complete a Case Decision Summary document considering any comments

   from the SPM at the audit or during the Reason to Urge discussion (the meeting

   following suspension). At the meeting the SPM could be accompanied by a

   friend who must be a Royal Mail employee, a registered Sub Office Assistant

   or a SPM who also may be a representative of the National Federation of

   Subpostmasters. The document would include the rationale behind the

   recommendation and the document would also have imbedded all relevant

   documents, letters audit reports and the transcript of the Reason to Urge

   meeting so that the Head of Contracts could see the reasons behind the

   recommendation. The Head of Contracts would then if they agreed with my

   recommendation, concur and sign off the document or come back with

   questions before they finalised a decision.


16. 1 have been asked to describe any appeal process available to SPM's whose

   contract had been terminated. There is an appeal process where a SPM can

   appeal against the decision to terminate their Contract for Services. There was

   a panel of senior managers who were not connected to the case but were fully

   trained appeals managers who would revisit the case and invite the SPM in for


                                  Page 6 of 20
                                                                                   WITNO9450100
                                                                                 WITN09450100




   a discussion and they would then decide whether the decision was correct or

   not. If they did not agree with the termination recommendation the decision

   would be overturned and the SPM reinstated.


17. I have been asked what input a Contract Advisor had whether an investigation

   into potential criminality was conducted by the security team or whether a case

   was taken forward as a debt recovery matter and whether this changed over

   time during my time served as a Contract Advisor. If an issue was flagged to

   the Contract Advisor from various teams, they would look at the type of issue

   and their involvement would primarily be to flag to the Financial Service Centre

   in Chesterfield, the Network Team or Security Team. Other than this

   signposting the Contract Advisor would not be involved in deciding course of

   action in terms of criminal investigation. In terms of debt recovery while the SPM

   was still in post the Contract Advisor would agree a timeline for repayment. !f

   a SPM's contract for services had been terminated, then the Financial Service

   Centre would deal with debt recovery, not the Contract Advisor.

18. 1 have been asked to set out my recollection of this case and to review

   documents that may potentially be helpful on providing a response to the matter

   of the investigation I have referred to documents which have assisted me in my

   response on both the body of this witness statement and the index. I was not

   involved with the security investigation undertaken by Stephen Bradshaw

   Security Manager. The Contract for Services was with Mr. Bailey and my

   dealings were only with him as such. It was only later that I found out that Mrs.

           Bailey had received a caution I believe on the grounds that she had falsified the

           branch accounts.

                         ii.iir
        19. 1 have been asked to describe the circumstances of when I first became aware

           of Joan Bailey's case and the circumstance that I was made aware of the loss

           at audit and to outline by whom the audit was undertaken and any other details

           in regard the audit and the loss. My response is outlined in paragraphs 19-21.

           1 was made aware on the day of the audit that Mrs. Bailey had said that she

           had been inflating the cash to hide mounting losses. I received an email from

           Post Office Security on 6 January 2011, document POL00055917 stating that

           a new case had been raised but it was much later that I found out that Mrs.

           Bailey had received a caution, but I cannot remember how I found out.


        20.As the usual course of action would be to receive a telephone call if an issue

           was discovered during audit, I am presuming that I did receive a telephone call

           from Judy Balderson, Field Support Advisor on 5 January 2011 in which she

           said there would be a large loss at Howey Post Office.


        21. Judy Balderson, Field Support Advisor, telephoned on the day of the audit, 5

           January 2011 to say that the audited shortage was £13,044.23 but she was

           unable to give a final figure as an engineer was in Howey Post Office fixing a

           problem with the luggable kit used in the satellite branches. Mrs. Bailey had

           said to Judy Balderson that she had been covering losses by inflating the cash

           and that Mr. Bailey had been unaware of what she had been doing as she

           completed the balance at Howey Post Office.

                                                                              WITN09450100




22. 1 have been asked questions in regard the suspension/ termination of Mr.

   Bailey, what documents and oral information I had been provided, whether I

   discussed this with anyone and my reasons for suspending Mr. Bailey, my

   understanding of the terms of Mr. Bailey's suspension and what explanation, if

   any I had given to Mr. Bailey. This is addressed in paragraphs 22-24. As stated

   previously Judy Balderson Field Support Advisor telephoned on day of audit, 5

   January 2011 to say there would be a large loss at Howey Post Office. I

   immediately telephoned the Head of Contracts to report that there was a large

   loss at the branch and the decision was taken to precautionary suspend Mr.

   Bailey's Contract for Services. The loss could not be explained, and further

   investigation would be required. The decision was also taken to protect Mr.

   Bailey against any further losses.


23. Having examined document POL00061533 I discussed whether Mr. Bailey

   would be willing to make his premises available for a temporary SPM to run the

   branch to maintain service. This document was a standard letter sent out from

   the Network Admin Team.


24.As part of the discussion above he would have been informed that he would be

   precautionary suspended pending further investigation into the loss. I cannot

   recollect what else was said or what documentation was recorded as the Inquiry

   Team have been unable to provide me with a copy of the case summary that I

   would have completed at the time.


25. I have been asked my reasons for considering the summary termination of Mr.

   Bailey's contract and what information I had received prior to writing to Mr.

   Bailey a letter dated 13 January 2011, POL00061533 (pages 4-6). There were


                                  Page 9 of 20
                                                                                   WITNO9450100
                                                                                 WITN09450100




   several material breaches to the Contract for Services including Section 1

   paragraph 5, Section 12 paragraphs 4,5,6,7 and 12. I would have received the

   audit report POL00055918 and the breaches were identified from this report.


26. 1 have been asked to consider a memo from Judy Balderson, Field Support

   Advisor received on 17 January 2011, POL00062294 and my understanding

   and my responses to this. I believe I would have added the memo to the case

   decision document but without sight of this document I cannot confirm that this

   was the case. Judy Balderson Field Support Advisor informed me on the day

   of the audit that an engineer was on site as there was a problem with the

   luggable kit used at the satellite branches, Hundred House and Llanbadarn

   Fynydd and that she would have to return to complete that part of the audit. The

   follow up audit showed a surplus of £42.18. It is not unusual to have a surplus

   as well as shortages and there is no explanation why there was a surplus.

   Transaction corrections could take weeks to come back from the Post Office

   Financial Centre in Chesterfield and it would appear from the copy of the memo,

   that the Baileys were hoping that they would receive a surplus transaction

   correction, but I cannot confirm that they were actually thinking this. Section 12

   paragraph 4 of the Contract for Services states that the SPM must ensure that

   accounts of all stock and cash entrusted to him by Post Office Ltd are kept in

   the form prescribed by Post Office Ltd. He must immediately produce these

   accounts and the whole of the Post Office cash and stock for inspection

   whenever so requested by a person duly authorized by Post Office Ltd. Again,

   I can only surmise that Judy Balderson was referring to this.


27. I have been asked for my recollection of what was discussed with Mr. Bailey at

   the interview on 2 February 2011, POL00061533 (page 7). Without the

                                                                                 WITN09450100




   transcript of the interview or copy of the tape which has not so far been provided

   to me despite requesting this on several occasions I cannot recall what was

   discussed but it would have been recorded.


28. 1 have been asked to consider the letter I sent to Mr. Bailey on 21 February

   2011, POL00061533 (pages 10-11) and to consider my reasons for not

   terminating Mr. Bailey's contract, whether I discussed this with anyone, my

   views on the fact Mr. Bailey remained liable for the debt and whether my views

   have since changed. As stated above I have not been given a copy of the

   Conduct Case Summary where my rationale would have been recorded and

   then sent to the Head of Contracts for concurrence and sign off if it was agreed

   to reinstate Mr. Bailey. Working within the parameters of the Contract for

   Services the debt remained and Mr. Bailey was responsible for making all

   losses good Section 12 paragraph 12 of the Contract for Services refer. I was

   working within the guidelines set by senior managers and POL legal team.

   Given the outcome of the Horizon court case I would hope that the Contract for

   Services has now been revised.


29. 1 have been asked to review document POL00061533, a response from Mr.

   Bailey dated 15 March 2011 (pages 17, 18), my opinion of the comments within

   the letter on the handling of Mr. Bailey's case and whether my opinion had since

   changed. Contract Advisors had to try to resolve conduct cases within 6 weeks,

   but it was not always possible to do this. This case started on 05 January 2011

   and was concluded with the letter of reinstatement dated 21 February 2011.

   Contract Advisors dealt with several complex cases as well as the recruitment

   of prospective SPMs which involved a lot of travel going to buildings where you

   could interview prospective SPMs. This was also the case with conduct cases,

                                  Page 11 of 20
                                                                                    WITNO9450100
                                                                                 WITN09450100




   so timelines were always tight. I firmly believe that in this case I turned around

   Mr. Bailey's case in a reasonable timescale.


30. 1 have been asked to consider why the Post Office view Mr. Bailey's resignation

   as one to avoid summary termination of his contract, what influence if any did

   access to the discretionary fund have in this decision and with the benefit of

   hindsight, how, if at all would my response be different. As a Contract Advisor

   we were required to use standard letters that were agreed by senior managers

   and POL legal team. At the time Mr. Bailey resigned he was still suspended,

   and the advice given I presume was that this was a resignation to avoid

   termination. I cannot confirm this as I have not had sight of the decision case

   summary. There was no influence regarding access to the discretionary fund

   which was administered by Post Office Ltd and the National Federation of

   Subpostmasters. As stated, these were standard letters which had been

   produced by senior managers and agreed with POL legal team.


31. 1 have been asked to consider the following in regard the letter I sent to Mr.

   Bailey on 21 March 2011 POL00061533 (pages 21, 22). What actions had I

   taken as to ensure due process was followed as agreed with the National

   Federation of SPMs, what merit did I place on Mr. Bailey's opinion that he had

   been let down by Post Office and with the benefit of hindsight, how, if at all

   would my response be different, in my letter to Mr. Bailey, I confirmed that all

   due process had been followed which had been agreed with the National

   Federation of Subpostmasters. I can understand that Mr. Bailey felt let down

   but as I said all due process was followed. Unless there has been a change in

   the SPMs contract the response would have been the same, working within the

   parameters of the agreed processes.

32. 1 have been asked about the details of contact with Mrs. Joan Bailey and

   referred to document POL00056387, Transcript of Joan Bailey's interview.

   Whether there was any record of when this took place and what was discussed

   and how I responded to the account by Mrs. Bailey. Looking at my letter dated

   13 January 2011, POL00061533 (pages 4-7) it appears that the meeting was

   with Mr. Bailey and Mrs. Bailey accompanied him in the capacity of a `friend'

   which was held in Swansea Mail Centre but without the case summary and the

   transcript of the discussion I cannot say what was said at this meeting.


33. 1 have been asked what was discussed with Joan Bailey on the telephone on

   18 March 2011, POL00061533 (pages 23 -24) refers and what I discussed and

   whether I made any record of this conversation. Without sight of the case

   decision document, I cannot say or recall what was said during the phone

   conversation, or if it was me that had the conversation with Mrs. Bailey.


34. I have been asked to consider what my response was to the letter sent by Mrs.

   Bailey on 28 March 2011, POL00061533 (pages 23-24). As above without

   access to the case decision document I cannot recall what if any response was

   made to this letter from Mrs. Bailey.


35. I have been asked what my involvement was in the case following Mr. Bailey's

   resignation, POL00069057 (pages 18-23). My only involvement was to reply to

   Kish Brown in the Former Agents Team that Mr. Bailey had resigned. The

   Former Agents Team were responsible for recovering outstanding debt.


36. I have been asked for my response, if any, to the fact that Mrs. Bailey was dealt

   with by way of a caution. My role as a Contract Advisor was to ensure that Post

   Office branches were operated within the Contract for Services, and I was not

   directly involved with the investigation by the Security and Investigation Team

   and any action taken against Mrs. Bailey would be down to any decisions made

   by the Security and Investigation team.




37. 1 have been asked what contact I had with the other Post Office employees involved

   in the investigation and if at any stage I had concerns about the way in which Post

   Office was managing the investigation and if so, did I raise my concerns. Additionally,

   at any stage whether I considered whether the losses identified at the branch might

   be the result of errors with Horizon and if so whether I have any concerns about the

   contractual liability of Mr. Bailey for the losses. My responses to these questions are

   in paragraphs 37-39. My only contact in this case would have been with Judy

   Balderson Field Support Advisor regarding the audit at Howey Post Office on 5

   January 2011. There would have been little if any involvement with Stephen

   Bradshaw's investigation as this was a matter solely for the Security and Investigation

   Team, I was only involved with breaches of the SPMs Contract for Services. There

   was no contact with Jamail Singh.


38. I was not involved with this investigation as stated above this was solely a matter

   dealt with by Security and Investigation.


39. I was not involved with the prosecution of Mrs. Bailey my role was solely to address

   matters with Mr. Bailey around breaches to his Contract for Services.


40. I have been asked whether prior to my involvement in the case of Joan Bailey I had

   any previous experience of SPMs attributing losses to errors with Horizon. I can

   recollect occasions where SPMs did consider Horizon to be the cause of losses in

      their branch. These issues were usually raised by the SPM through contacting the

      helpline at National Business Support Centre. If issues were raised directly with me,

      then I would check what action they had taken and if their issues had not been

      resolved satisfactorily, I would email the Resolution Manager, Andrew Winn at

      Financial Service Centre to investigate further and respond to the SPM directly.


General


   41. I have been asked to what extent if any, did I consider a challenge to the integrity of

      Horizon in one case to be relevant to other ongoing or future cases. I cannot really

      say as any challenge to Horizon would have been flagged by the SPM to the National

      Business Support Centre (Helpline) who would have forwarded the issue to the

      appropriate department. On occasions where the SPM raised issues with me, I would

      enlist the support of the Resolution Manager at Finance Service Centre. I am not

      able to comment further on this.


   42. I have been asked to what extent if any, do I consider the investigation into bugs,

      errors and defects in Horizon was sufficiently carried out by POL, and information

      regarding these sufficiently passed to POL from Fujitsu and to detail my reasons on

      this. I am unable to comment on these questions, as they were outside my scope

      and area of expertise and knowledge. I was not privy to the investigations and

      dealings between POL and Fujitsu teams into the Horizon system.


   43. I have been asked to what extent do I consider I had sufficient information regarding

      bugs, errors and defects in Horizon, who provided this detail and if no provision who

      should have provided this. As above, I am unable to offer up any comment on this

      for the reasons outlined above at paragraph 42.

44. 1 have been asked how I became aware that it was possible to remotely access

   Horizon transaction data. I was not aware that Fujitsu could access transaction data.

   I understood that checks could be run in response to issues raised by POL/ SPMs.


45. I have been asked that with the benefit of hindsight, what, if any, changes to the

   conduct of investigation by POL have since or should been made. As an employee

   of POL, I would follow processes/ policy that had been written and agreed by senior

   management and POL legal. I would hope that lessons had been learnt and

   processes and policies now written to ensure that the findings of the Horizon court

   cases are incorporated and implemented.


46. My final question asks whether there are any other matters that I consider the Chair

   of the Inquiry should be aware of. I have tried to answer the questions posed on the

   case regarding Mr. Bailey's suspension by referring to the documents provided and

   by recollecting the standard way I would have dealt with cases and actions I would

   have taken. I have no recollection of this case and any specifics relating to it. The

   main documents that I would have inputted into have not been presented to me. I

   have requested a copy of the Decision Case Summary that I would have completed

   from start to finish including senior manager sign off of my recommendation in Mr.

   Bailey's case. I have also requested a copy of the transcript of the Reasons to Urge

   discussion with Mr. Bailey or a copy of the tape but unfortunately the Inquiry Team

   have been unable to provide me with these documents, which would no doubt have

   assisted me in providing more detail to some of the questions.
