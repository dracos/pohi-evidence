              Subject Information Requests remaining the same or decreasing, respond to that
              request within the applicable time limit.

3.11.3.9      Subject to the paragraphs below, if Fujitsu Services' ability to respond to a Subject
              Information Request is outside the Response Capability, Fujitsu Services shall
              notify Post Office how long it would take to respond to that Subject Information
              Request, and shall (subject to Fujitsu Services' current and expected future
              workload for dealing with both Audit Record Queries and Subject Information
              Requests remaining the same or decreasing) respond to that request within Fujitsu
              Services' estimated response time plus 10% of that time.

          agrees that for so long as Fujitsu Services' ability to respond to such requests
          remains outside the Response Capability, Fujitsu Services will not be able to

          Request shall be in the form of an Excel (or other equivalent product) spreadsheet

          of Post Office for Subject Information Requests to be responded to in a particular
          order. Post Office agrees that if by accommodating such priorities, Fujitsu
          Services would be unable to achieve a time limit for a Subject Information Request
          to which Fujitsu Services is responding or is required to respond, that time limit
          shall not be applicable and (unless otherwise agreed) Fujitsu Services shall respond
          to such request as soon as reasonably practicable.

3.11.3.13 If the number, type and frequency of Subject Information Requests Fujitsu
          Services receives from Post Office and/or Data Controllers are such that some or
          all of those requests are not being responded to within applicable time limits or
