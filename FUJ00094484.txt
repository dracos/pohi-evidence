an agreement on how future releases will be

how these high severity incidents will be
resolved.

11/03 C/fwd. This is becoming urgent; POL
and Fujitsu have differing views as to status
of the Als, with POL believing they remain
open and “High”. This may stop progression
through AG4, and therefore stop the move
into full rollout from pilot.

IT will articulate what is needed from POL’s
perspective to reduce the severity or resolve
the Als.

AD will discuss as a matter of urgency with
Dave Cooke as to how this can be
progressed and why the two organisations
have different understandings.

Note that a meeting is arranged with the
respective security teams on 12" March
which should assist in resolution.

18/03 C/fwd. POL and Fujitsu are now in
broad agreement on how to progress these
incidents. Further meeting scheduled for this
week.
