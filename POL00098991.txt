i think the response here is that what we are all trying to do is be crystal clear.

His words yesterday were

“think SS will come up with a report which says Horizon [the computer] is a good system but the combination of this
system with the poor audit/investigation/ help function cause problems . Horizon gets the blame for something is
shouldn't be bearing.’

All agreed that Horizon [the computer] should not be wrongly blamed

Hope that helps

To see.

This seems to suggest that JA wants to describe everything as Horizon — the support processes etc... - so that he can say
we admit defects with Horizon,

Dear Mark,

Thanks for the call. My contact details are below, and my mobile is:' GRO I

I'll send you a draft copy of the statement we'll issue Monday morning, and the press release we will put out
at 6pm Monday afternoon, in due course. It would be extremely helpful if we could have sight of the definition
of ‘Horizon’ you will be citing, and vital that it is made absolutely crystal clear that it is not just the computer
software programme. But I’m sure you know this!

Kind regards and talk soon,
Janet
