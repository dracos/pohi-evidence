Dear Brian

As I mentioned at yesterday's meeting with Chris, I attach a proposed draft letter to the CCRC in light of the fact that you
have now completed your review of past/current prosecutions.

Leaving aside the fact that I have drafted it to be sent by Susan (which may now be inappropriate) please can you review
and amend it.

I am not precious about my drafting so please feel free to amend as you see fit.
Clearly we need to get updated information from CK which I will get from Jarnail/Martin Smith in due course.
Regards
