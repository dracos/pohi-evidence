+ " Not happy " with Retention or increase in variable pay

* Happy with appt of COO . Wondered if should be Dep CEO . I said the title should be
for you.

* Happy that you could change three execs . They were unclear about terms we could
pay for ED exit .

* Deeply disappointing and I said you would feel the same . HOWEVER , THEY HAVE
NOT SENT THEIR ADVICE IN TO THE SEC OF STATE.
