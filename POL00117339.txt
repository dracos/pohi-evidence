Dear Mr Clark,
Your Constituent Paula Thomson - case reference M120

Thank you for your letter of 27 March 2015 to Paula Vennells, which has been passed
to me for reply.

I have looked into the concerns your constituent has raised in relation to the Post
Office’s decision not to mediate her case. There is, in fact, no inconsistency in the
two communications she received.

The first communication she received enclosed Second Sight’s final independent
review of her case, including Post Office’s investigation into the matters it raised. In
these reviews, Second Sight offer their view as to whether a case might be suitable
for mediation. However, while this is their view, all mediations are entirely voluntary.
The final decision on whether or not to mediate a case ultimately rests with the
parties involved. It follows that either party can decline to take part.

Mrs Thomson’s case has been thoroughly re-investigated through the Scheme and,
after careful consideration of all relevant facts (including Second Sight’s final report),
the Post Office has concluded that mediation does not offer any realistic prospect of
resolving your constituent’s complaint for the reasons set out in our letter to her.

I hope this clarifies the position.

Yours sincerely,

Angela Van Den Bogerd
Head of Partnerships
