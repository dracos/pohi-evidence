Ladies and Gentlemen,

Counsel thinks that it would be more productive to see just a few witnesses individually on Monday and to stagger
everyone's time so you are not waiting around too much. Accordingly, please could you attend at approximately
the following times?

1. Catherine Oglesby - 11am

2. John Jones - 12pm/12.30pm

3. Andrew Wise - 2pm

4. Anne Chambers 2.30pm

Please let me know if you cannot make it at these times and we'll re-jig if necessary.

Kind regards.

Stephen Dilley
