Dear Sir

Post Office Limited -v- Yourself

We refer to our faxes dated 20 November.

We enclose by way of service the Post Office’s supplemental disclosure list. With the exception of the
message store referred to at number 1. of that list, these are documents which have been previously
disclosed, but which for the sake of good order, have been included on the list.

The message store audit trail referred to as document 1 contains details of everything that is recorded at
the counter by Horizon. It is located at Fujitsu. The message store itself is of considerable size and we
believe that the Post Office has obtained from Fujitsu and disclosed everything from the message store
that falls to be disclosed pursuant to CPR 31.6. However, if you seek any further information from it,
please contact Brian Pinder of Fujitsu Services to make an appointment directly (and copy us in). Mr
Pinder is at Lovelace Road, Bracknell, Berkshire, RG12 8SN. He has stated that you would need to specify
precisely what information that you require from the message store as it can take some time (hours to
days) to retrieve from the servers, although this would greatly depend upon the information required. As
you know the Court ordered inspection of any documents to take place 7 days after disclosure.

Finally, please confirm whether you have any further disclosure to make, particularly in view of our
unanswered letters dated 31 October, 7 and 9 November 2006 to your solicitors, further copies of which
we attach for your ease of reference.

Yours faithfully

Bond Pearce LLP
