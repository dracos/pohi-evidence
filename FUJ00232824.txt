Live Defect Status 17/02/2022

POA_Live_Defect_Management Monthly Report 17.02.2022 08.59.xIsx

Based on the data in the system as at 08:59 today and Peaks tagged as ##LiveAffectingDefect. The spreadsheet attached shows the various Peaks belonging to
each segment and these are sorted based on the stacks they are in and the owner of that stack is listed on the right. The report is for information only, and any
action needed will be taken up when we run the weekly checks separate to this.
Below image is a comparison with the stats run on the last report on the 4"" January 2021.
