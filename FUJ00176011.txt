against POL by its postmasters where Fujitsu s/w was in use. DT confident no direct exposure to

Still WIP, may need to take legal action if nothing moves in June. Working capital
position and Fujitsu exposure being managed/optimized.

Customer (First Minister) in the week of 27" June
Currently under dispute. FJ leveraging global business relationship to resolve

--ii6ré drastic change next year

yee}: Still working through India operation transition plans as part of Iris

@ AP waiked through April actuals. Rev and OPPL tracking ahead of Q1RF, however concern on future
order intake

@ HT instructed that TCV used for Book to bill ratio should have its breakdown of duration. Ideally, ACV
would be sufficient for BB ratio. Al: YI to summarize each region’s backlog/order tracking method to
understand the difference by region. Al: DT/AP to show further backlog/order analysis in next MBR

@ AW requested DT/AP what kind of metrics they would like to see from GD. AP's initial thought is it is
difficult to set KPIs at macro level, and should take samples from several key accounts. Al: DT/AP to
get back to AW by first week of June with some suggestions.

@ Al: DT/AP to show pipeline for Q2 onwards in next MBR (not just Q1 pipeline)

@ FIX: HC exit is ahead of plan primarily due to early completion in Spain. Need close watch on Belgium
