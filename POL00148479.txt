What was asked for

Board asked for:
* Consideration to be given to what changes could be made within the existing Terms of Reference
+ Whether the caseload could be “triaged” to allow the caseload to be minimised

+ Steps to be taken to settle case M022

Sub Committee asked for the following:

+ Following their agreement in principle to Post Office taking control of the Scheme that an implementation plan should be
developed.

+ That the Linklaters letter should be developed with Communications colleagues drawing on the further deloitte assurance
work.

To address this we have provided:

+ An update on the Current Scheme progress

+ An examination of the opportunity to triage cases

+ What Changes could be made within the existing Terms of Reference
* Our Recommended Option — Post Office Taking Control

+ Two Further Scenarios to provide a counterpoint to the recommendation

Scheme Data

150 cases have entered the scheme. These cases have been classified according to whether they were criminal, whether
the incidents referred to occurred pre-2007 and whether the applicant is a serving subpostmaster. A lot of the classification
has necessarily been deduced from applicant statements and has not yet been verified. As such, over reliance on this data
is used for illustrative purposes but should not be relied upon publicly.

Out of the 150 cases that have entered the

scheme: DN CONFIRM CRIMINAL DATA FRIDAY Out of the 70 cases that have been investigated to date:

+ 30 of the 70 have raised core horizon issues

+ 59 of the 70 have referenced branch operating issues (38 of
these cases do not mention core horizon issues).
67 of the 70 have raised support issues (only 2 cases relate to
support issues only).

* 20 cases are criminal.

+ 38 refer to incidents that occurred prior to 2007.

+ 50 are criminal.
+ 16 are currently serving as subpostmasters.
* 69 describe incidents that occurred prior to 2007.

Any attempt to “triage” data on this basis is likely
to be rejected by the Working Group.

Of the 30 cases that have raised core horizon issues:

+ 11 of these are criminal.

+ 15 cases related to issues that occurred prior to 2007. 3 of
these 15 are criminal cases.

+ 7 of the cases are non-criminal and relates to issues that
occurred after 2007.

Wide Horizon definition has been in use for a long period (since Second Sight’s original terms of reference) any triage

on that basis is likely to be strongly resisted and lead to a break down in relations with the Working Group.

Redefining the scheme within the ToR @

Journey to the WG and Scheme

. Ministerial commitments following SS Report set out broad way ahead.
. PO/JFSA/SS designed the Scheme and published details

. WG established and agreed its ToRs (not published)

. What changes could be made within existing ToRs?

. Ministerial commitments relatively broad - some scope for change

. Published Scheme but can be varied BY WG

. Under TORs for WG PO would need agreement of WG to change - experience to
date shows reluctance to do so

Therefore:

. if PO asks for change what happens if WG refuses?

. where does that leave us?

. would we be prepared to force the issue and break the WG?

Annex — Tony Hooper

* The programme team have considered Tony Hooper's likely positioning in relation to the
Scheme and any possible modifications.

« In summary the team believe:

a) That Tony will not remain as Chair of a radically modified Scheme if Post Office take
Control.

b) That Tony will not assist Post Office if it looks to disband the Working Group and end
Second Sight’s engagement

c) That he is unlikely to take a public stance against Post Office .

d) That he believes that Post Office should accept that the Scheme will take around 18
months and that is normal for a Scheme of this type.

e) That as Chair he will maintain the Status Quo rather than managing conflict necessary
to redesign the Scheme.
