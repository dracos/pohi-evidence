Gareth Jenkins Fujitsu is our expert in the case of McQue due for trial 28th
February,2011 Could you please consider his comments below.

‘Another potential issue is Commercial cover for my time. At the moment I've run out
of the time that POL have committed for me to work on such cases and this needs to be
extended before I can do any more. Penny is trying to sort this out with POL, but I
thought you should be aware and may be able to influence things.’
