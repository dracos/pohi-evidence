Hi Sam,

Please find attached POL’s latest legal update on the case, at the conclusion of the evidence phase and as the closing
statements phase commences (from today).

In addition, rather than wait until Thursday, I thought I should make you aware of the unfavourable coverage in the
Daily Mail over the weekend. POL feel aggrieved that it is a misrepresentation and because it only uses part of POL’s
statement. POL spoke to the journalist at length and considered sending a legal letter expressing concerns over the
lines of questioning. On balance, POL decided not to given it was not front half news and might prolong the coverage

further.

Hi Stephen,

Thanks for these —I have included them in Kelly’s box today. With regards to the media updates, would it be possible
to have them on Thursdays? Just that Kelly’s weekend box generally goes on a Thursday so Friday would miss this.

ject to legal privilege: POL Litigation Update
Hi Sam,
Further to last week’s ministerial meeting on POL, I attach POL’s summary of media coverage since the Trial started

(5 November) to bring the Minister and others up to speed. Thereafter, we'll forward a weekly media update (is
Friday or Monday best?).

As regards POL’s legal updates, their legal team is submitting these in accordance with the trial timetable, which I
think makes sense. The different phases of the first trial (Common Issues Trial) conclude as follows:

14/11/18: cross-examination of claimants’ witnesses concluded (POL update attached)
26/11/18: cross-examination of POL’s witnesses concluded (POL update due shortly)
27-30/11/18: court not sitting

6/12/18: closing submissions (POL will provide update soon after)

I should also stress that POL’s legal team are wholly responsible for the contents of these legal updates (we’re unable
to follow the trial on a daily basis and offer an opinion on it).

We do not yet have the timetable for the 2™ trial (Horizon Trial) but would expect POL to provide updates on a similar
basis.

I hope this is ok but let me know if you’d like to discuss anything further.
Regards,
Stephen

Subject: Follow-on actions from yesterday's meeting
Hi Sam,

Thanks to the Minister for her time yesterday, detailed below are the follow-on actions (Both Sams’ please let me
know if I have missed anything).

* Weekly briefings as the litigation case progresses (verbal and written updates) (UKGI to action)

* A face-to-face meeting with Tom Cooper (UKGI to action, Tom Aldred and Gavin Lambeth can also possibly
attend)

¢ Further information around the franchising process and local issues particularly regarding accessibility,
service provision, etc. As such, going forward the Minister wants direct briefing from POL on franchising cases
(Sam White and team to action)

* An understanding of who invests when POL franchises with a retailer — (1 have checked with POL on this point,
and they say it is a joint investment but the exact split is dependent on the contract and commercial agreement
— they will provide more information when the request is commissioned) (Sam White and team to action)

© An understanding of the breakdown of the £17million fall in sub postmaster remuneration (Sam White and
team to action)

Thanks,
Tosin
