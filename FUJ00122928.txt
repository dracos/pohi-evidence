Gareth's statement is fine. It explains why the duplications occurred and most importantly of all it
confirms that it has no affect on Horizon's accuracy. I have added an extra paragraph to tie it in with
the trial of seema Misra and confirm that only ARQ447 has any duplications within the disc you produced
as PT/02.


The defence must be made aware of this issue and I would be grateful if a signed copy of the statement
could be sent to me direct.

Penny, as discussed our legal team in principle are happy with this and have agreed that if yourselves
provide a witness statement covering your explanation below and additionally the following points then
the work-around gets the green light.


Juliet suggested the additional points to cover include, what are we doing about it, and over what period
did this anomaly occur (i.e. upon migration to HNGX). she also suggested that the witness statement be
completed by Gareth Jenkins, your expert witness.

We had a meeting with Penny from Fujitsu today in respect of a problem that has potentially being in
existence since January.


It appears that the audit data has a number of duplicate transactions contained within (live data is not
effected). It is potentially as a result of systems backing and re-checking itself up towards the close
of play as it only appears to affect data from around 16:40 until close.


The duplicate transactions have the same transaction number so can be readily identified, so there is no
danger of mistaking them for fraudulent duplicate transactions such as POCA duplicate withdrawals.
Unfortunately you may feel this works in favour of the defence as this may strengthen claims as the
question the integrity of Horizon.


This is a further comment provided by Penny Thomas to Alan Simpson (Info Sec)


The duplication of audited records has not, in any way, affected actual physical transactions recorded on
any counter at any outlet. The duplication of records has occurred during the auditing process when
records were in the process of being recorded purely for audit purposes from the correspondence servers
to the audit servers. It should be noted that this duplication of data in the audit stream has always
been happening. However the Horizon retrieval process automatically discarded duplicate records before
creating the ARQ spreadsheets, while the current HNG-X retrieval process for Horizon data does not do so.


Therefore I'm not sure of the course of action we should not take. My initial response was to request
that Fujitsu provide a witness statement to quantify the above that we could attach to each case (as
appropriate), and treat each case where this is not accepted individually.


Can you please offer any guidance as to what we should do.   Fujitsu will not send any further ARQ
requests until we tell them that we are happy with the potential work-around or are able to come up with
another solution.

Subject: Duplicatation of Transaction Records in ARQ Returns




Sue/Mark/Jane


We have identified that a number of recent ARQ returns contain duplicated transaction records.


with Horizon counters, the mechanism by which Data is audited has always worked on the principle that it
is acceptable to audit the same data more than once - in particular if in doubt as to whether or not it
has been previously audited successfully.


The Mechanism used on Horizon to retrieve the data took this into account and only presented one instance
of such duplicate data in the ARQ extracts.


However it has recently been noticed that the HNG-X retrieval mechanism does not remove such duplicates
and a quick scan of the ARQs provided to Post office Ltd since the change to the new system indicates
that about 35% of the ARQs might contain some duplicate data. A Peak has been raised to enhance the
extraction toolset and remove such duplicate data in the future. However until the fix is developed,
tested and deployed, there is a possibility that data is duplicated.


The reliable way to identify a duplicate transaction is to use the <Num> attribute that is used to
generate the unique sequence numbers. This attribute is not currently included in the Excel version of
ARQ data that has been passed to Post office Ltd in the past. This will be included in all future ARQs
until the problem is fixed. A workaround, using the <NUM> attribute is suggested, and a detailed process
is attached.


Note that we have identified a scenario with Postal Services transactions where multiple, identical mails
items are accepted (ie the Quantity button is set to greater than 1), but Postage Labels are printed for
each individual item. This results in separate transactions being generated for each item, which are
identical in the ARQ extracts (there is another minor difference in the raw data apart from the <Num>
attribute, but this different attribute is not currently included in the ARQ extract).


I've put together a spreadsheet detailing affected ARQs, which is also attached.


Mark/Jane I've tried to call you both this morning but I understand you are both tied up.   Please call
and we can discuss.


Kind regards
Penny/Tom
