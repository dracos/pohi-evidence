POCL SERVICE MANAGEMENT

1. Introduction
This report is produced by the POCL Service Management team and provides a high level “in-flight” assessment of any
threats to overall business continuity in the Congo 4 live service environment. The primary purpose is to identify any issues
(actual or potential) that might threaten the Congo 4 roll-out or regression from ICL Pathway services. It should be noted
that this report may have an operational bias.

For ease of reference, the report utilises a traffic light system with the following keys -

Immediate Threat to Business Continuity

Potential Threat to Business Continuity

No Threat to Business Continuity

AF

The next full Horizon Service Report is scheduled for W/C 24 August 1998.

Due to the continuing trends of ‘incomplete transactions’ which occur at the rate of four in every ten thousand transactions.
The generic problems on the subject have taken a higher profile with both POCL and ICL Pathway directing specific resources to

resolve the problems within an agreed timescale of three months.
Due to the actual impact on the ‘live’ environment that ‘incomplete transactions’ has, the overall status of business continuity is

now ‘Amber’.

Benefit Payment System @

Incomplete Transactions

The title of ‘lost transactions’ has been changed to ‘incomplete transactions’. This is considered to be a better description
of the problem. To date all transaction have been recovered by manual fallback.

It has been agreed within both POCL and ICL Pathway that the current levels of Incomplete transactions is not
acceptable for a system where the primary function is to record and manage transactions. From a POCL perspective it
would seem reasonable to expect that the Horizon system has integral safeguards to protect and preserve transaction
data. Integrity, consistency and durability are fundamental requirements of any transaction processing IT system. As it
is, there seem to be variety of situations where the system reacts unpredictably and loses data.

An operational workshop has now been scheduled with resources from prominent domains within POCL and ICL
Pathway. The desired objective from the workshop is to propose software enhancements which will eliminate/reduce
Incomplete Transactions to the target level. Once made, proposals will be referred to ICL Pathway Technical Support
for feasibility. The next report will provide a synopsis of the workshop, detailing where we are now and the next steps.

The forecast date to resolve the overall problem of Incomplete Transactions has been set for the end of November 1998,
however, some categories will be resolved sooner.

Baseline for Incomplete Transactions

To provide an easy baseline against which incomplete transactions can be assessed. Figures have been produced to
show the volume of incomplete transactions per 10,000 encashments returned on an adjusted monthly basis and
secondly a target figure of incomplete transactions that POCL should be aiming to receive prior to the advent of Live
Trial.

The current situation has remained the same as last month.

Current month level of IT per 10,000 encashments received 4.0
Target level of IT per 10,000 encashments received 0.26

“Major Office’ List (Manual Foreign Encashment Offices)

The new “Major Office’ list was scheduled to be introduced into the ‘live’ environment on Monday 29 June 1998.
However, due to a sequence of events, the new list was not actually implemented until Friday 10 July 1998. The impact
to the customers was contained by POCL Service Management.

A full review will be conducted to examine all the processes and identify improvement opportunities.

5.2 Transaction Processing & ICL Pathway Interface

Incomplete Transactions

The transaction Processing & ICL Pathway interface remains on ‘Amber’ status, with incomplete transactions having a
large impact on this.
Other factors which are of concern are:

© unmatched exceptions
cash account errors

Last months report included a statement from TP detailing the impact of incomplete transactions within their domain, in
addition, a report has been furnished showing the projected effect in monetary terms to the TO environment.

5.3 Accounting & Reconciliation

6. BES: Volumetrics

Definitions for the purpose of this report.
A transaction is an incident of “a recorded and auditable instance of business activity, involving Service provision or Stock

movement across organisational or Service boundaries”.

A payment is the Child Benefit allowance money due for one week, or for four weeks (in the case of a four- weekly

allowance).

An encashment is a measure of the work effort in a customer session from the clerk accepting the payment card to
returning the card with monies, i.e. one customer is paid all due Child Benefit allowance. Thus, a customer may save
several payments before visiting their PO. During such a transaction there will be one encashment of several payments.

e GENERAL RECONCILIATION PERFORMANCE

An increase in the number of transactions this reporting period can be attributed to a return of customers foregoing
payments during the two May Bank Holidays which coincided with schools breaking up at the same time.

e IMPROVEMENTS
This period - ratio of incidents to transactions 1:1682 Last period showed 1: 1504.

e¢ CONCERNS

Lost Transactions form 70% of incidents received this month. Concerns therefore remain and Service Management
is specifically tasked towards resolving the underlying causes. An action group has been specially targeted at this
for resolution.
