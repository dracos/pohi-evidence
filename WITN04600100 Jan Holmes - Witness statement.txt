POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY

FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF JAN ROBERT HOLMES

|, JAN ROBERT HOLMES, will say as follows:

Professional Background
1. Following an early career in Information Technology in the Civil Service | left in
1985 and worked for a number of small IT companies until 1995 when | joined
ICL Financial Services division based in Wilmslow. In 1997 | transferred to ICL

Pathway in the role of Audit Manager. | am currently retired.

2. While in the Civil Service | attended a number of training events and study

resulting in passing a post-graduate diploma equivalent qualification offered by

Page 1 of 20
WITN04600100
WITN04600100

the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA). In 1983 | became a Member of this
organisation and in 1996 a Fellow. This qualification was to become important
factor in my role within Pathway and my relationship with the BA and Post Office

Auditor community.

Pathway/Horizon Role

3. During my time on the Programme my role changed. In 1999, following the
retirement of the then Quality Manager, the scope increased to include Quality
Assurance and process definition. In 2000 | left the Programme to join Propel, a
central ICL Improvement Project, but returned in 2001 with a broader
responsibility for Programme Assurance including development risk

management. | left the Programme in 2008.

4. The Audit Manager role acted as the user interface to the Horizon Audit Solution.
This was the part of the Pathway/Horizon system involved with generating,
gathering, providing secure storage and distributing audit data extracts to the
Benefits Agency (BA) and Post Office (PO) at their request. It was also the
organisational interface to the Internal Audit departments of BA and PO where
my IIA qualification linked into the professional qualification requirements of
those departments. Documents that describe each of these functions were
produced and are associated with this Statement. They are 1.) Post Office
Account Internal Audit Manual (WITN0460_01/1). and 2.) Horizon System Audit

Manual CSR+ (WITN0460_01/2).

WITN04600100

Reporting and Escalation

5. In 1997 the Audit Manager role was part of a broader Quality and Risk
Management (QRM) Group run by Martyn Bennett, who was on the Pathway
Senior Management Team and reported to the Managing Director, John Bennett
(no relative). The QRM held monthly group meetings where issues and concerns
were aired and shared. If matters raised at this forum required escalation Martyn
Bennett, as Head of QRM, would take them to the Senior Management Team as
part of their regular review. At a detailed audit level each Audit Report had an
associated Corrective Action Plan (CAP) which was updated periodically to show
progress towards closure of audit observations and recommendations.

WITN0460_01/3 is an example of a CAP.

6. Visibility of audit issues was achieved though Audit Reports and CAPs having a
Distribution List that included those people involved with the audit and the Senior

Management Team.

7. WITN0460_01/4 is an Assessment Report of the Pathway audit function by ICL
Group Quality and provides an external perspective of how the audit function was

operating — “ quis custodiet ipsos custodies”

Audits

8. The following paragraphs concern audits.

Page 3 of 20
WITN04600100
WITN04600100

. Section 5 of WITN0460_01/1 identifies the need for an annual audit plan
and how that plan is produced and authorised.

. Part of the plan production process is the identification of the potential
audits via an audit needs assessment.

. As the sole auditor in 1998 | was responsible for all aspects of the audits,
their identification, planning, execution and reporting.

. Paragraph 5.2.5 of WITN0460_01/5 actually refers to ‘ competing
assignments in Q3’ which was to do with my own competing assignments
in Q3, for example EPOSS PinlCL Task Force.

. | have been asked what the ‘ competing priorities’ referred to were, | have
addressed this in the paragraph above.

| have been asked whether | consider that POCL/POL were sufficiently
involved in providing requirements prior to the roll out of Horizon. | do not
fully understand the question. However, if the Inquiry is referring to
WITN0460_01/5 then | doubt that POCL/POL/BA had any input to the list.
The audit function was very immature, as was the relationship between it
and the corresponding functions in POCL/POL/BA. If you are referring to
the Horizon Audit System they would have been enshrined in the contract
and developed in the Audit Trail Functional Specification
(WITN0460_01/6) [Note that this is v6 of the document for the BI3
Release in 2002. | do not have access to earlier versions of this document

but | believe v4.0 would be the most appropriate for Release CSR+].

WITN04600100
WITN04600100

g. The responsibility for providing business requirements rested with the
customer who made specific demands for functionality or more general
demands with regards to performance, speed, turnaround, security etc.
which would be for the supplier to respond to through a proposed solution.
For example, you would not normally expect a customer to demand a
specific computer model on which to run their system. With regard to
Pathway much of this activity had taken place before | joined and it would

be wrong of me to speculate as to the adequacy or otherwise of that work.

9. Exhibits WITN0460_01/7, WITNO460 01/8 & WITNO460_ 01/3

a. WITN0460_01/8 and WITN0460_01/3 are the Audit Report and Corrective
Action Plan for an audit of the CSR+ Development activity conducted in 1999.
Document WITN0460_01/9, the Audit Plan and Resume for 1999 identified a
number of discrete Mid Stage Quality Audits across the development lifecycle
but these were combined into a single Report and CAP. Para 6.2.6 of
document WITN0460_01/9 explains the rationale. Document WITN0460_01/7
is the Audit Report produced following the completion of the EPOSS PinICL
Task Force.

b. As described in the Report, the PinlICL Task Force was a dedicated team
assembled to address the significant backlog of EPOSS PinlCLs that had
started to accumulate between June and August 1998. It also carried out

some additional tasks, again described in the Report.

Page 5 of 20
WITN04600100
WITN04600100

c. My role was to bring this team together, agree on a set of working
procedures, liaise with other non-Task Force teams on the Programme,
manage the workflow and attempt to achieve the objectives set in the original
Briefing Paper : ‘ That objective was to reduce the PinICL count to zero or low
tens by the cut-off date and the target set by dividing the current PinICL count
by the number of days available.’

d. The successes and failures are well documented in WITN0460_01/7 and in
truth there are more failures to report than successes. However, if you take a
step back from the negative detail it is fair to say that the Task Force was a
success insofar it vindicated the Programme’ s decision to address the
EPOSS PinlCL problem ‘ head-on’ and while the quantitative objective of zero
or low tens was not met the Report must have stimulated action on the
Programme as EPOSS was accepted by POCL/POL less than two years
later. Once the Task Force was complete | was released back to my normal
duties.

e. | had not previously worked on such a large or complex project so did not
have a view on this other than they existed, nor could | pass an opinion as to
whether the number of PinlCls or equivalent logs was excessive.

f. The concerns expressed fell into two categories: 1.) The technical accuracy
and structure of the code when written, 2.) The impact of continual change to
existing code to fix problems and/or insert new functionality. Of the two | felt

that the second carried the most risk as change can generate code instability

Page 6 of 20
WITN04600100
WITN04600100

and the potential for downstream problems when the impact of changing code

is not fully recognised.

. If you look at the Distribution Lists at the front of each Audit Report and
associated Corrective Action Plan you will see that, for the most part, the
entire Senior Management Team is identified. Other individuals are included if
they have a specific interest in the content or they are identified as actionees.
Table 4 of WITN0460_01/3 identifies, for each action, who is responsible for
addressing the action ‘ Owner and which Management Team Member MTM
has oversight. The degree of SMT direct involvement was dependent on the
nature of the observation. For example in para 9i below | have referenced a
CAP entry that has 2 members of the SMT directly responding.

. A later version of this document (WITN0460_01/10) dated May 2000 shows
all Corrective Actions Closed with the rationale for closure.

Action 015/04 of WITN0460_01/10 dated May 2000 contains the following
text generated between November 1999 and May 2000 [abbreviations

explained in text] :

17/11 : This action falls within Development but requires higher level drive.
Has links with CS and BD. MJBC to speak with TPA direct.

CS : Customer Services Department

BD : Business Development Department

MBJC : Mike Coombs (Programme Director)

TPA : Terry Austin (Development Director)

WITN04600100
WITN04600100

25/11 : Work on Al298 identified that majority of problems (~80%) were to
do with error and printer error handling. Daily meetings had been
instigated. TPA of view that while original code had not been good it would
be difficult to justify the case for re-writing now.

25/11 : Email issued by TPA :-

“ We have not formally closed down the recommendation that we re-
engineer the EPOSS application due to its inherent instability. Since this
recommendation was made, a number of events/actions have taken place.
We embarked upon a major maintenance exercise for LT2 which targeted
several known stability issues. In parallel, we carried out a defensive
testing activity which identified a number of faults which were addressed.
The intensive exercise designed to remove acceptance incident 298
resulted in many substantial improvements to the error handling,
messaging and printing aspects of the product. We finally introduced
improved unit and link testing and more disciplined configuration control.
Finally, the maintainability and enhanceability of the product has been
proven by the speed and quality of the SIP 16 and EPOSS Reconciliation
developments.

We will of course continue to monitor the PINICL stack for the next few
months and if necessary re-evaluate this decision. Would Jan please
close this issue formally using the rationale described.”

08/12 : JH requested statistics on fixes delivered to live from RM. Also

informed TPA that requires agreement of MJBC before this can be closed.

WITN04600100
WITN04600100

RM : Release Management

08/12 : MJBC confirmed that unless RM statistics contradicted reports
provided by PJ the recommendation could be closed.

PJ: Peter Jeram (CSR+ Project Manager)

07/04 : Email to MJBC, TPA & PJ providing details of RM EPOSS fixes to
live. Asked for confirmation that matched PJ reports. If does then will
close.

03/05 : Reminder email sent to above seeking early response. Chased on
same day.

10/05 : Following response received from MJBC : “ As discussed this
should be closed. Effectively as a management team we have accepted
the ongoing cost of maintenance rather than the cost of a rewrite.
Rewrites of the product will only be considered if we need to reopen the
code to introduce significant changes in functionality. We will continue to
monitor the code quality (based on product defects) as we progress
through the final passes of testing and the introduction of the modified Cl4
codeset into live usage in the network. PJ can we make sure this is

specifically covered in our reviews of the B&TC test cycles. Closed.

Under the circumstances, and given the senior management involvement with
the resolution, | considered this to have been adequately resolved at the time.
During the EPOSS Task Force activity | formed the opinion that developers

working on the EPOSS product were caught in a ‘ test error-identify bug-code

Page 9 of 20
WITN04600100
WITN04600100

fix-re test’ cycle and, because of the time and number of PinICLs, were not
able to pause and take a wider view of what was happening. For example, |
was not aware, nor made aware, of any Root Cause Analysis work being
undertaken. This could result in rushed defect analysis, not identifying all
defects to be fixed in a single pass, rushed coding resulting in poor quality
code even if it worked. One element of the EPOSS Task Force was to
address the effectiveness of the bug fixing activities and | was satisfied that
the Task Force achieved this.

. WITN0460_01/7 identified that 44 man weeks of effort was required and that
after absences, leave, inexperience with the EPOSS product and other
reasons only 25 man weeks was effectively delivered. However, it should be
remembered that while the Task Force was made up by ring-fencing existing
members of the Development team, overall progress and activities continued
on the Programme, and some staff had to be diverted to maintain this
progress. The Programme did not stop just because the EPOSS Task Force
was operating. Individuals of note include Dave McDonnell who was
instrumental in analysing to code quality and Steve Warwick who, if my
memory serves me well, was the EPOSS Product/Project Manager and who

provided a lot of historical context.

10. Testing : Exhibits WITN0460_01/4, WITN0460_01/8_& WITNO460_01/11

Schedule A15 para 1.14.4 :‘ The contractor shall provide proof of sufficient and

satisfactory preparation for the implementation of a Release. This shall include

testing the implementation, reversion and regression from the Release.”

a. The evidence offered in WITN0460_01/8 indicates that there were shortfalls
in compliance with development (including test) processes and standards.
The ‘ OLS’ referred to in WITN0460_01/8 are the Pathway Online Standards,
which were developed during 1997/8 and was an attempt to establish a
Quality Management System and present it to the project in a way that was
easy to access and use. WITN0460_01/8 identifies the patchy nature of the
take-up of the QMS by the Programme. However, testing was undertaken at a
number of levels and scrutiny of the relevant Project Plan will show what
actually took place.

b. WITN0460_01/8 also offers some insight into why this was happening. The
Management Summary at Section 3 is pertinent and | cannot add anything
further 24 years after the event.

c. Please see b.) above.

d. | was not made aware of any staffing issues at the time of the CSR+ Audit. If |
was they would have been presented in WITN0460_01/8.

e. WITN0460_01/8 resulted from an internal audit into CSR+ Development. As
such the report and its content would have been made know to ICL Pathway

management only. | cannot recall any requests for a broader circulation of the

Page 11 of 20
WITN04600100
WITN04600100

report being made. Internal Audit Reports were not usually made available to
the customer.

f. This was through the associated Corrective Action Plan WITN0460_01/3 and
was measured in two ways, 1.) Whether the recommendation was accepted
by management and 2.) How long it took to address it and bring it toa
conclusion. All Corrective Actions identified in WITN0460_01/3 were closed
by May 2000 some 6 months after the report was issued. This was not an
unusual timeframe to close a CAP bearing in mind that some actions may

have had significant work required to close.

11. Customer Services : Exhibits WITN0460_01/12, WITN0460_01/13

WITNO460_01/14 & WITNO460 01/15

a. WITN0460_01/12 is the Audit Report resulting from an audit of Pathway
Customer Services. It was identified in WITN0460_01/5 and completed in
January 1999.

WITN0460_01/13 is the Audit Report resulting from an audit of the Horizon
System Helpdesk. It was identified in the Internal Audit Plan 2000
(WITN0460_01/16) and completed in April of that year.

Document WITN0460_01/14 is the Audit Report resulting in a further audit of
Pathway Customer Services. It was identified in WITN0460_01/16 and
completed in April of that year. While the Terms of Reference identifies that |
would be conducting the second Customer Services audit it was in fact

conducted by a representative from Group Quality and Business

Page 12 of 20
WITN04600100
WITN04600100

Effectiveness. | cannot recall why this substitution was made. This audit was
a follow-up to the audit reported in WITN0460_01/12 but concentrated on the
key management processes :
i. Incident Management and Problem Management
ii. Business Incident Management
iii. Change Management — Release Management
iv. Change Management — Reference Data

v. Operational Test

WITN0460_01/15 is the ICL Pathway Monthly Progress Report for February
2000. | was not privy to this document, or other reports at this level within the

Programme.

. My view of the adequacy or otherwise of Customer Services and the Horizon
System Helpdesk are documented in WITN0460_01/12 and
WITN0460_01/13 in the reports and | can add nothing further here.

. All Audit Reports and their associated Corrective Action Plans were circulated
within the Pathway Programme and a level consistent with their content and
also widely across the Management Team.

. In keeping with other CAPs | was satisfied that my concerns were being
addressed. Occasionally the lack of urgency was frustrating but by-and-large
corrective actions were addressed and disposed of.

. As previously stated | was not privy to the ICL Pathway Monthly Report as

this was output from the Monthly Senior Management Team Meeting so had

not seen WITN0460_01/15 before, even though | am mentioned in it. | have

Page 13 of 20
WITN04600100
WITN04600100

no recollection of the meeting although the report says it went well. | suspect
my invitation was attributable to Pathway doing the right thing by inviting the

Audit Manager as an observer.

12. Various PinICL Documents

a. As the Pathway ‘ user interface’ of the Audit Solution, PinICLs (fault reports)
that were raised against the Audit Solution would be routed to me for initial
analysis and, at the end of the required work, to check on any proposed
closure. Generally speaking those of a technical nature were re-routed to the
relevant technical authorities. However, on occasion | would raise a PinlCL to
highlight an operational issue that required rectification. One such example is
WITN0460_01/17 where the absence of an Attribute Grammar Catalogue was
causing difficulties when constructing the R-Query statements to conduct
audit data extractions.

b. | was not aware of any pressures to close issues and attribute them to ‘ user
error . Indeed | cannot see what benefit this would bring since attributing a
fault to user error when it wasn’ t would likely generate more debate and
wasted time trying to resolve with the user.

However, there would be times when it was perfectly valid to close an issue
as user error. For example, in live running if it was brought about by
ignorance (lack of training, coaching or supervision) or a deliberate act by the
user to try and game or cause the system to fail, or because in a test situation

that was the purpose of the test — to simulate a user error.

General

13.The audits that were undertaken during 1998, 1999 and 2000 were planned and
took account of various risk factors relevant at that time. These are identified in
each of the Plans. Some audits were conducted because there were interest
over how an activity was being carried out, for example CSR+ Development
(WITN0460_01/8); some were conducted as a ‘ readiness review’ for key
activities that were soon to be undertaken, for example Implementation
(WITN0460_01/18); some were conducted to confirm that activities instigated by
Pathway Management were appropriate and would be likely to generate the
expected outcome, for example 11 Week Plan Review (WITN0460_01/19). Audit
Plans were subject to Pathway Management Scrutiny before being approved and
being used as a basis for work planning by Internal Audit (me).
In terms of importance and relevance to the Inquiry | would say that :
i. The CSR+ Development Audit (WITN0460_01/8) with its scope set
on the CSR+ development activities that would lead to acceptance
by the Post Office;
ii. EPOSS Task Force Report (WITN0460_01/7) with its focus on the
EPOSS product and management’ s attempt to identify and solve a
major product quality concern;
iii. The Implementation Audit (WITN0O460_01/18) with its focus on the

state of readiness for the major roll-out to the Post Office estate;

would be the three primary pieces of work.

Page 15 of 20
WITN04600100
WITN04600100

14.1 believe my work was valued at all levels, as evidenced by the acceptance of
Audit Reports and the willingness to contribute and respond to Corrective Action

Plans.

15. The number of audits conducted was, to some extent, resource limited to me.
However, extra resource was recruited as my personal workload expanded into
other areas. | was not aware of any other auditors elsewhere in ICL/Fujitsu
conducting audits that went much beyond the scope of ISO9000 compliance and
looking at the ‘ what’ and not just the ‘ how’ . In that context | consider that i

audits | conducted were sufficient, timely and relevant.

SPM Prosecutions

16.Requirement 829 in WITN0460_01/11, Page 54, para 1.133.2) establishes, inter
alia, that audit data shall be retained to support live investigations and
prosecutions and that it would be evidentially admissible. It did not present
specific requirements that the Post Office would need or request any further
support in investigations or prosecutions. However, the nature of the Horizon
System Audit solution (WITN0460_01/2) meant that direct support would be
required of Pathway to enable that access. Consequently Pathway implemented
an Audit Data Retrieval process that was used by the Post Office to request audit
data. | provided this service as part of my audit role until 2000 when | left the
Programme. On my return in 2001 this function had passed to Customer

Services under the Security banner.

Page 16 of 20
WITN04600100
WITN04600100

17. The use that the data was put to by the Post Office was of limited interest to
Pathway, unless it pointed to a deficiency in the overall solution. It was extracted

and delivered to Post Office for them to use at their discretion.

18. However, it was known that Post Office ‘ investigations’ were often into unusual
occurrences in a Branch that might point to, or prove, criminal activity and as

such | was aware that the Post Office were conducting prosecutions of SPMs.

19.Because of my role as Audit Manager | was involved in a number of them and
this involvement was from undertaking simple data extractions to producing
Witness Statements and, on one occasion, being invited to attend Court to give
testimony in support of a Witness Statement. In the end this case was, | believe,
settled out-of-court and | was not needed. This happened in 2004 although the
allegations against the Post Master dated back to 2000 and was documented in

the Audit Report on Cleveleys Post Office (WITN0460_01/20).

Balance Discrepancies

20.1 was not aware of the ‘ balance discrepancy’ issue, nor its potential link to

defects, so did not have a view or opinion.

Page 17 of 20
WITNO04600100
WITNO04600100

Other Matters

21. This was an extremely busy, complex and challenging Programme. One of the
largest non-military projects in the UK at the time, and working on it was a

pleasure and a privilege.

22.My role as Audit Manager gave me insight into how the Programme was
progressing, good or bad, and | was able to influence in a number of areas. Many
Audit Reports were produced between 1998 and 2000 and these reflect a
snapshot of what was found at that time and the opinions and conclusions drawn
in those reports were all valid at the time. Hindsight may show that some were
misguided or simply wrong but all were made with the interests of the

Programme at heart.

23. Completing this Witness Statement has caused me to open and read documents
from 20 to 24 years ago and | have tried hard not to influence my statements with
knowledge of how the Programme eventually secured acceptance from the Post
Office - | was directly involved in the acceptance of the audit solution — or of

what has been happening subsequently elsewhere.
