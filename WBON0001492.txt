Hi Johann & Lisa

Please can you advise Michelle on the absolute deadline? I am aware it is very urgent but not sure I have been told
a date.

Thank you,

Hi Rebecca,

Dear Michelle,

As discussed yesterday, we are looking for Royal Mail Group Audit Committee or Audit, Risk & Compliance
Committee (ARC) minutes for meetings that took place during 2010 & 2011. It appears the Post Office Limited
Audit, Risk & Compliance Committee was not formed until 2012 so we believe the relevant information must be in
the Royal Mail Group meeting minutes.

Within these minutes the relevant search terms will be:
* Credence
Credence IT Controls
e Credence change controls
e — IT Controls update

Many thanks in advance.
Best wishes,

Rebecca

Hi Michelle,

Ah, maybe I was given the wrong number.

Thank you for agreeing to look into this. I am sorry to be a pain but it is very urgent (it relates to ongoing litigation
which is currently before the High Court — you might have seen it in the news). Are you able to look into it sooner
or ask someone who might be able to do this sooner in your team? Again I apologise for the late notice — we are
working to strict deadlines set as part of the trial process and we have been struggling to track down these
documents as we believed they were at the Postal Museum, but it appears not.

Thank you in advance.

Best wishes,

Rebecca

Hi Rebecca,

I haven’t received a voicemail from you but I will need time to look into this and locate the records. I am
travelling between sites so will contact you in the next couple of days.

Kind Regards
Michelle

Dear Michelle,

Further to my voicemail, I work at Post Office Limited and we are looking to access the minutes from the Royal
Mail Group Audit, Risk & Compliance Committee meetings from before the split, namely 2010 & 2011. I was

Are you able to send me these documents?
Many thanks,
