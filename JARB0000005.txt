Subject: RE: Post Office threats!!

Dear Mr Bristow,

Thank you for your further email of 27 October and many sincere apologies for not having got back
to you sooner,

I have already written to David Jones MP expressing my concerns about this matter and offering
support and furthermore I have raised the matter with the Secretary of State for Business,
Innovations and Skills, Lord Mandelson, to ask him what can be done. As soon as those replies arrive,
I shall of course send them on.

I have pursued the matter of the Parliamentary Question raised by Mr Newmark and have obtained
a copy of the reply sent to the Business, Innovations and Skills Minister by the Managing Director of
Post Office Ltd. The reply is attached. I am afraid it doesn’t really shed any further light on the
matter.

Ihave also after a little further research come across a more in depth background note on this
particularly disturbing issue, raised with me by a local councillor in North East Hampshire. With his
permission, I shall share his understanding of the position with you, and ask for your comment,
before then forwarding these concerns again to Lord Mandelson for urgent attention.

In the meantime, if you have any further updates, please do let me know.

Yours sincerely

James Arbuthnot
