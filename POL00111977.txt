Q._— when they're in the branch and they're serving
customers?

AL Yes

Q. Now, a couple of quick points.
“Ist Stamp” in the F2 line, which is "Postal Services”,
yes, what happensis that it registers that a first
class stamp is going to be purchased.

AL Yes

Q. That's right
enter in the price of a first class stamp, do they?

A. No, they don't

When they press

And the SPM doesn’t need manually to

Q. And the reason for that is that there is a reference
data table from which that’s populated?
A. As far as the technical aspects of it, I’mnot familiar
with what goes on behind the scenes, what know is when
you press that button
When you press it
that's what comes up.
- the price of a first cla
Yes.

stamp pops up?

oProPre

So there are two aspects to what's happening: there’s
a button press, which is the actual physical input by

the subpostmaster or subpostmistress?

>

Yes

Q. And then there’s what the -- the value of that

transaction, which is coming from the system
Yes.

back onto the screen?
Yes.

oProP

So there are two elements of that interfacing together,

yes?

A. Mmhm.

‘MR JUSTICE FRASER: Exotic though your hand gestures are,
they're not going to come out on the transcript.

MR GREEN: My Lord,

Mr Johnson, those are acting together to produce

what's going into the basket: two components

A. As I understand it, yes.

Q. - a button press -- it’s practically what you would
see?

A. Yes

Q. So the SPM presses a button and the item that they have

pressed and its value should appear in the basket?

AL Yes.

Q. If it is all working well?

AL Yes.

Q. Now, just looking at the layout of that table, there is
quite a lot of white space there, isn't there?

AL Yes.

Q. And the actual buttons are very cosy, they're all stuck

right together, aren’t they, with no white space between
them: "Ist Stamp", "Ist Large Stamp", "Ist x 12 Stamps”,
they're all absolutely tight together, there’s no white
space separating them?

Yes, the items in the middle of the screen correspond to
the -- in most-- in the vast majority of cases to the
most commonly used products.

And the point I was just seeking to make to you is there
are a number of ways that screen could be laid out, and
on that screen we can see there would be plenty of room
to separate the buttons from each other more, wouldn't
there?

It would appear that way.

Yes. And you are aware that sometimes SPMs have
problems with miskeying, don’t they?

Yes.

Can we look please at {F/932} on page 7 please
(F/932/7}. We-can see here if we look at the -- sorry,
shall we start at the first page just to be fair to you,
so you can see what the documentis.

Okay.

This is a miskeying project feasibility study and you
can see that it is a document from May 2012, yes?

Yes.

And if we go back please to page 7 of the document

ul

{F/932/7}, there are a number of recommendations. I'm
Just going to follow through one particular one. If we
look at the penultimate bullet point there.
Yes.
“Look at the Buy and Sell icons on the travel home
screen are too close together and it becomes difficult
to isolate the correct icon. It would be useful to
clearly show which icon to press showing the Buy and
Sell icons more clearly”

Yes?
I can see that, yes
One of the features of the buyand sell icons, which
you, I think will know about, is that they are at the
end of the transaction, so if you press the wrong one,
the transaction has already gone?
No, that’s not right
Let’s havea look, if we may please, at page 14 of the
document (F/932/14}. Is what's said in the top line of
that correct? Let’s just look at it together, if we
can:

“The Buy and Sell icons on the travel screen are too
close together.”

And the second box says

“Having these two icons next to each other many of

the Counter Colleague hit the wrong icon, which means

1 my understanding — I don’t work in the cash management
2 team, but to my understanding, the cash management team
3 use that information to decide how much cash to send to
4 that branch on their next scheduled delivery, or if
5 they're holding extra then -- more than they need, how
6 much they need to return.
7 Q. Now, part of your witness statement has dealt with the
8 reports available to SPMs.
9 AL Yes.
10 Q Oneof the things they can’t do is export data to a CSV
1. file , can they?
12. A. I don't know what a CSV file is
13 Q Oran Excel spreadsheet?
14 A. No, they can’t export that from Horizon, as far as

15 I know, no.

16 Q. Andhas any thought been given, as far as you know, to
17 allowing that to happen?
18 A. I don't know.
19 Q. ThePost Office itself has Credence, doesn't it?
20 A. Yes.
21 Q. And that allows it to look at the transactions that have
22 happened in branch?
23 A. Yes, as far as I’maware, yes
24 Q. Doyou know why the Post Office just doesn’t use the
25 same reports as are available to the SPM? Why does it
7
1 need Credence?
2 A. I don’t know.
3 Q Because the Post Office could print-out the till rolls
4 and analyse it that way too, couldn't they?
5 A. As far as -- well, 1 don’t know whether the Post Office
6 could print-out a transaction log as you would print out
7 in branch. As far as I’m aware, that is only available
8 in branch.
9 Q Oh, I see.

it was settled, for example by cash, card or cheque. It
is therefore possible to see all the transactions where
customers have paid by debit or credit card.”

Yes?

>

Yes.

Q. Now, let's say you're in a situation faced by one of the
Jead claimants, Mr Bates, where he is worried that there
may be duplicate entries in his account, but he doesn’t
know what they are; how does he use the Horizon
reporting system to find them? What does he do?

A. To my knowledge, the transaction log will produce what
I have said there

Q. No, I understand. Mr Johnson, I'mnot trying to be

unfair to you.

this, you suspect there may be some duplicate entries,

Just practically , so we can look at

perhaps giving you a discrepancy that’s unexplained.
Just practically , whatdo you do if you are Mr Bates in
your sub-post office in Craig-y-Don in Wales and you
want to try and find out what's going on?

‘A. Are we saying that these are transactions which don’t
appear on the transaction log?

Q. Well, he doesn’t know whether they will -- we will come

to that in a minute

AL Okay.

19

Q. — but let's just say -- what do you suggest that person
in that situation does?

A. I would advise a postmaster in that instance to first ,
raise the issue with NBSC.

Q. Okay. But if they're told that it is their
responsibility to find discrepancies in the branch, what
can they do for themselves? Do they -- because we have
heard of SPMs printing out very long transaction
rolls --

AL Yes.

Q. - wehave actually got one, it’s quite long. Is that
what they do if they're looking for possible duplicates,
they print out -- because they don't know what the value
is

MR JUSTICE FRASER: You are rolling about two or three
questions into one again, Mr Green.

MR GREEN: Sorry.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: Why don’t you just give me
a walk through of the steps that you say hypothetically
someone in Mr Bates’ position should take.

A. So if a postmaster wants to check what transactions have
gone through, they would goto the transaction log. If
they wanted to look at a particular -- as I have

suggested, it could be filtered in a number of ways: by

date, by product, by value, by stock unit, by user,

1 there are a number of waysit can be filtered , and
2 obviously the more you can filter it, the shorter the
3 report will be, and then it would bea question of, as
4 you say, printing the transaction log out and manually
5 checking each item.
6 MRGREEN: Butif you're looking for duplicates, you would
7 have to try and remember the figures you have seen?
8 A. Yes, I meanif you're looking for a duplicate then
9 I'm-- I mean, I don't know, I’m-- I'm guessing here
10 that if there would be that there would already be
1. one transaction on the transaction log. I’m not quite
12 sure what you are getting at. Presumably we can see one
13 transaction on the transaction log and there's a thought
14 that that transaction may have been duplicated, is that
15 what we are .?
16 Q. Well, you get an unexplained discrepancy of a figure you
17 don't recognise
18 A. Right.
19 Q. Let's say £1,723.
20 A. Okay.
21 Q. Andyou don't understand how that can have happened
22 You think "Well, maybe there's a duplicate entry of some
23 sort”, just, you know, this is one example, or maybe
24 there’s a number of duplicate entries. You can see it's
25 not very easy, is it?
21
1 A. It’s not the most user-friendly way of investigating
2 Q. That's all I was really asking.
3 MR JUSTICE FRASER: Can I just ask youa question. When you
4 say the filtering that it can be done, that can be done
5 in branch, ean it?
6 A. Yes
7 MR JUSTICE FRASER: Am I right that would only be of any --
8 that would only be of any assistance if you knew what
9 you were looking for already, wouldn't it?
10 A. Not necessarily. A postmaster may have come to the
11 conclusion that a discrepancy occurred on a particular
12 day by virtue of looking at his cash declaration for the
13 previous day and the current day, and the previous day
14 had no discrepancy, the current day does, so he may want
15 to filter then to that particular day when the
16 discrepancy occurred on his cash declaration
17 MRJUSTICE FRASER: Mr Green.
18 MRGREEN: Could we look please at (F/1556} please. Now,
19 this it documentis titled the "Network Development
20 Programme Operation Simplification”, and if we go over
21 the page (F/1556/2}, you can see the sorts of things
22 that it is covering and can we go please to page 6,
23 which is the "Business Context” section (F/1556/6}, and
24 can I just invite you to look at this first paragraph:

especially around branch accounting and reconciliation ,
which operate using legacy processes. They are
unnecessarily complex and detract Post Office branch
resources from serving customers. Stock Unit Management
and accountability is very poorly controlled and is
operated on very complex business rules. The lack of
accountability and visibility of cash and stock

transfers between Stock Units can lead to errors, rework
and provides opportunities for fraud.”

Is that a statement that you disagree with, or agree
with?

A. I would agree with that
Q. And then if we look just below:

Similarly , Suspense Accounting is based upon legacy
cash accounting practices, ill-defined and out of date
processes. Inefficiencies lead to poor utilisation of
resources both in Post Office branches and Support
Services °

Is that somet

with? Is that fair?

A. Myexperience of the suspense accounts in branch is that
it works it does what it’s supposed to do.

Q. Can you see why that might be a reasonable view, or is
it a completely unreasonable view?

A. I don't think it’s completely unreasonable, no

MR GREEN: Okay, I'm very grateful. My Lord, I have no

MR JUSTICE FRASER: Can you just tell me what date this

MR JUSTICE FRASER: Mr De Garr Robinson?

Re examination by MR DE GARR ROBINSON

‘MR DE GARR ROBINSON: Mr Johnson, you were asked some

questions about buttons being close together, but there

are some questions you weren't asked that I would like
to ask you now.

As I understand it, you have experience of working
in branch?

Yes.

Do you have experience of working in a busy branch?

Yes.

How much experience of that sort do you have?

I have -- before I started my current role in 20121 had

worked in branches since 1984.

Q. So could you give the court some indication of how
much -- would you consider yourself very experienced,
not very experienced? I'm just trying to get a clear
answer from you.

A. I suppose you could say 1am very experienced at working

Day 7

1 Q. Thankyou. It was suggested to you that you were

2 shown one of the screenshots in your witness statement

3 and it was suggested to you that the buttons were close

4 together. What you weren't asked about is whether you

5 took the view that the buttons you saw, or the buttons

6 on the screen -- that their closeness together is.

7 a cause of any difficulty in using the system. Would

8 you like to comment on that question?

9 A. The fact that buttons are close together can mean that
10 one does occasionally press the wrong one. However,
1. that is easily rectified .

12 Q. Andwhenyousay it is easily reconciled, why is it

13 easily reconciled?

14 A. Rectified

15 Q. Rectified, 1’mso sorry.

16 A. If one would notice that the wrong button had been

17 pressed -- for example, you may goto sell a first class

18 stamp and you know yourself that the cost of that stamp

19 is 67p. If youwere to hit the first class large stamp,

20 which is next to it, in error, the amount on the stack

21 would bea different amount, so it would be easily

22 recognisable that you had then pressed the wrong button,

23 Q. Andanother question that you were asked is whether the

24 layout of the counter had been broadly consistent over

25 the period of operation of Horizon. Mr Johnson, you may
25

1 not be able to answer this question, but do you have

2 a view as to whether keeping the layout of the screen

3 consistent over time is a good thing or a bad thing?

4 A. That’s -- myopinionon that is it is a good thing

5 Q. Why do you say that?

6 A. Because one gets used to working on the system and the

7 buttons are where you would expect them to be.

8 MR DEGARR ROBINSON: My Lord, I have no further questions

9 ‘Thank you, Mr Johnson.

of data extractions?

Yes.

And over the course of that 17-year period, how many
extractions do you think you have carried out?

I couldn’t tell. you.
Hundreds?

Yes.

Hundreds.

You have probably seen every issue that possibly could
arise with extraction of data, haven't you?

I would say so, yes.

And how many others havea similar position to yours at
Fujitsu at any given time and carry out data
extractions?

Generally, there is a teamof three or four people.

And do they carry out a similar number of extractions
each year as you would?

Yes.

Would that number vary from year to year, or would it be
fairly consistent?

No, it varies. It varies week by week.
And you have experience of carrying out audit data
extractions both on Legacy Horizon and Horizon Online?
Yes.

If we could please go to {E2/1/10}. This is

Mr Godeseth’s witness statement, his first witness

29

statement, and he is a colleague of yours at Fujitsu,
correct?

Yes.

Now, at paragraph 31 there he says that he has been
informed by a colleague that the number of ARQs issued
since 2014/15 areas follows, and then he sets some out
there at 31.1 to 31.4, do you see?

Yes.

‘That suggests huge fluctuations over the years, doesn’t
ie?

Yes.

729 extractions in 2014/2015. Can you think of why that
would be?

I have no idea. It is what we would get supplied or
requests from the Post Office, so we don't control how
many we get.

Would it make sense to you if that was during the period
when the mediation scheme was taking place and so maybe
you had more requests at that time?

Yes, it could quite well be, yes.

And in 2016/2017 and 2017/2018, over 300 requests. Do
you think that these proceedings may have an impact on
that number and why itis a bit higher than for example
2015/2016?

It could well be, but I can’t guarantee that

Q. In 2015/2016, 103 without these two alternative events
going on. Is that perhaps more representative of what
you would get on a yearly basis, or do you not know?

A. I would be guessing if I said yes, without looking at
all the previous years and how it has incremented over
the years, I couldn't tell you

Q. Sure.
100 or so?

But in your experience that might be about right,

A. It could be, yes

Q. And for 11,000 branches in a year, it’s not a high
percentage of ARQs that were requested during that year?

A. I suppose so.

Q. Now, there are no figures there for pre-2014, and
the court has had had evidence from Mrs Mather -- and we

don't need to turn it up, but for his Lordship’s note it

is paragraph 19 of her first witness statement which is

(£2/8/4}. There Mrs Mather says that there is

a contractual limit on the amount of data requests that

Post Office can ask for of 720. Is this a limit that
you're aware of?

AL Yes.

Q. If there’s a contractual limit on the amount of ARQs
that can be requested, Fujitsu. must be keeping a record
of how many requests are made each year?

A. Yes, wedo.

31

Q. Why then are there no figures seemingly for prior to
2014?

A. [can’t answer that

MR JUSTICE FRASER: Have you been asked to get

A. No.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: You haven’?

A. No.

MR MILETIC: Butas far as you are aware, there would be
a record of those?

A. As far as I’maware, there is, yes.

Q. There should be really?

AL Yes.

Q. The purpose of your witness statement is essentially to
talk about the process of audit extraction, audit data
extraction, and the integrity of data and howit is
maintained during that process, is that fair?

AL Yes.

Q. If we could go back to paragraph 4 of your witness
statement {E2/10/1}, you say:

“During 2009/2010 the Horizon system was upgraded to
Horizon HNGX [Horizon Online] and the detail contained
in this witness statement refers to audited transaction

records generated by this upgraded ... system”

talking about transaction records generated from the
audit store; what you're not talking about
the case that those records are actually audited prior

it’s not

to going into the audit archive, correct?
No, it’s just the extraction data that I’m taking out.
Exactly. And so it’s an important distinction because
really the only time when those records are audited is
when they are extracted and then someone uses them to
compare against different records. Does that sound
correct?
I think so. I don’t think they are actually compared.
All the data that we extract is specific data from the
servers with all the transactions so it’s not -- I think
the word “audit data” -. it’s just we extract that data,
we don't then compare it. We then extract the data and
supply it to the Post Office.
Yes, so where it says “audited transaction records” it
might be slightly misleading because it is not that they
are audited prior to going into the audit store; that's
correct, isn’t it?
I don’t know how itis put onto the audit store
And the second sentence there:

“Unless I state otherwise in this statement when
I subsequently refer to the "Horizon System’ I am

referring to the ~... system as upgraded by Horizon

33

HNGX”

Looking at your statement I have not seen somewhere
where you have stated otherwise, and so actually your
evidence is limited to the extraction process under
Horizon Online, correct?

It is probably misleading. As I have been doing it that
jong, it is both Horizon and Horizon Online.

But the specific content of your witness statement from
that point onwards only addresses Horizon Online?

I would say it’s -- it’s the data that I have extracted
for these proceedings.

I see. And when you discuss controls, which we will get
onto in a little bit, is it your evidence that those
controls have always been the same and the same
processes have been followed both in Legacy and

Horizon Online?

I believe so. I don't knowall the controls -- the
technical controls which are used for the storage of the
data,

So when you provided your evidence here, you really were
talking about the controls as at effectively today’s
date when you were making extractions for this trial?
Yes.

And if we could go over the page please to paragraph 5
{E2/10/2}, the first sentence:

“When information relating to
individual transactions is requested, the data is
extracted from the audit archive media of the Horizon
System via the Audit Workstations”

And then this second sentence:

“Information is presented in exactly the same way as
the data held in the archive although it can be filtered
depending on the type of information requested.”

Pausing there, do you always provide data that’s
filtered , or do you sometimes provide data that’s
unfiltered?

We supply data that’s filtered

Are there any circumstances in which you provide
unfiltered data?

To the Post Office, I don't believe I have done.
And then you go on to say:

“The integrity of data retrieved for audit purposes
is guaranteed at all times from the point of gathering,
storage and retrieval to subsequent despatch to the
person making the request.”

Again, just in the interests of being precise, can
you explain exactly what you mean when you're saying
“data integrity"?

That's what I’m led to believe within the systems that

it is - that hasn't -- the integrity is complete, it

35

hasn't been touched in any other way.
So your definition of integrity of data is simply
whether it has been tampered with or not?

No, my definition of integrity is that the data I have
extracted and supplied to the Post Office my I'm
awareof is in - its integrity is complete.

And if I was to say the data integrity is the overall
completeness, accuracy and consistency of that data
which you can measure by comparing between sources,
would you agree with that as a definition of data
integrity?

Yes.

And if we could please go to (D3/1/67}, this is from

Dr Worden’s first expert report, and if we could look at
paragraph 238.6 and what he says there, which is:

“The audit system provides a highly secure and
tamper-proof record of what is entered into Horizon at
the counter, which can be used, in cases of any anomaly,
to provide a ‘gold standard’ for comparison with data
held in other parts of the Horizon estate, supporting
the diagnosis of software errors
kernel and redundant store of data (SEK and RDS)”

I’m not going to ask you about the second sentence

‘This acts as a secure

and those acronyms, but in terms of that first part, is
it your evidence as well that it is highly secure and

tamper proof?

The -- where the data is stored, I'm not involved in, so
I can’t answer that side of the question,

But in terms of whenit is extracted?

From my point of view, the processes that we follow and
extract them and supply them to the Post Office, that is
my belief

It is highly secure and tamper-proof?

Yes.

Andis it your evidence as well that it can be used in
cases of an anomaly asa gold standard for comparison?

‘They are -- they are words that I probably wouldn't us

but I’m happy with the integrity of the data that I give
to the Post Office.

But "gold standard” might be putting it a bit high for
your -- in your opinion?
Well, no, if you want to use "gold standard”, yes,

I will agree with that.

But in any event, you agree that the accuracy of that
audit data and maintaining the integrity upon extraction
is extremely important, particularly , if it is going to
be used in disputes with subpostmasters?

Yes.

And if we could go back to (E2/10/2}. Paragraph 6 where

you set out what you say the following controls are that

37

apply. Did you look at any specific Fujitsu documents
when listing what amount to 12 controls there?
Where am I looking at here, sorry?
So in paragraph 6 you say:

“During audit data extractions the following
controls apply
Yes.

And then you list out in subparagraphs, 12 specific
particular controls and 1 was just wondering whether you
looked at any specific Fujitsu documents when you set
out those controls?

No, this is the process -- there are security processes
and protocols in place within Fujitsu, but these are
basically the security controls that we have as a team
that we have to extract the data

‘My question might not have been entirely clear,

Mr Dunks, but when you set out these 12 controls, when
you were drafting this part of your statement, did you
look at any specific documents in order to think of

and write out these 12 controls?

No, this is my knowledge of the controls.

So this is purely from your memory thatyou draft the 12
controls?

Yes.

I see. And in terms of those 12 controls, have they

or have some potentially changed?
No, that’s basically as is the whole time I have been
there.
As far as you can recall those are ~
Yes.
Would you say that those are sort of the core controls,
or they just some that you thought of?
No, they are the core controls surrounding the audit
extraction
So at any point in time when we look we should probably
see the 12same controls listed at other points in time?
Yes.
And just over the page, please, {E2/10/3}, at
paragraph 7 you just describe the fact that you have
extracted data in relation to these proceedings. And
then paragraph 8, again, I just wantto be very precise
and I want to make sure that I understand exactly what
is being said in this statement. Paragraph 8 begins:
“There is no reason to believe that the information
in this statement is inaccurate
Pausing there, what is "this statement"? Do you
mean your witness statement?
Yes.
Okay:

39

“There is no reason to believe that the information
in this [witness] statement is inaccurate because of the
improper use of the system.”
Whatis the “system” there? Is that the system of
the process of extracting audit data, or is it something
else?
(Pause).
Good question. There's no
meaning by that, “There is no reason to believe
We will take this step-by-step, but just looking at that

I'mnotsure what I was

first sentence, you are not quite sure what you mean by
“system”?
I think I was meaning about the improper use of the
audit data extraction system.
So when you say “system”, you mean the process of
extracting audit data?
Yes, I do.
I see, so

“There is no reason to believe that the information
in this [witness] statement is inaccurate because of the
improper use of the system [in place for extracting
audit data ).”
Yes.

Pausing there, what are “all material times” in your
statement?

‘The whole time I had been using the workstations to
extract the data, as far as I’m concerned, there has
been no issues or faults with the workstations to
extract the data,

So “at all material times” is actually the 17 years you
have been at Fujitsu?

Yes.

I see, so:

“To the best of my knowledge and belief at all
material times the system ...”
Ie the process of extracting data:
~.. was operating properly, or if not, any respect
in which it was not operating properly ..”

Again, pausing there, it is slightly confusing. Are
you aware or not aware of any instances where that
system was not operating properly?
No, not really, no.

Okay. So you're not aware

‘There may have been a few faults -- software faults
I would say software faults -- where the system has
rebooted or whatever, but if that does, it interrupts
the data extraction which doesn’t complete, so we will

then re-run the data extraction. So it's not affecting

aL

any data that’s been extracted
I see. And is that the only example that you can
provide his Lordship as to occasions when that system
wasn't operating properly?

Yes.

So you say it was operating properly:

*. of if not, any respect in which it was not
operating properly, or was out of operation was not such
as to effect the information held within it”

What is "it"?
The data that I have extracted
I see, okay. So, Mr Dunks, how could you possibly say
that in any respect that the system wasn’t operating
properly, it wouldn't affect the data that you have
Surely if that process isn’t operating
properly, it musthave an effect on the data that it

extracted?

produces?

Well, no, because if it doesn't extract the data wholly,
or there is an issue with the PCat the time, it will --
it shows that there is an error, so we actually re-run
the data and there are some checksums within the data
which is a number for each day and if there's a gap
between ~ and we check that there’s no gaps between
those numbers, and on each report it states that there

are no gaps, which would show if it there were any

issues, but
And is it your case that there has never been
a circumstance where the data that's been produced

I see.

hasn’t[ sie] appeared inaccurate because of the process
used to extract it?

Not to the best of my knowledge, no.

So now that we have deconstructed that paragraph

a little bit, it is a very specific and slightly hard to
follow choice of wording. Has that come from you, or
has that come from somebody else, Mr Dunks?

It - I did produce the witness statement and then it
came back slightly altered to see if 1 was happy with
that and I read it and I was happy with it. Maybe
misunderstanding how it could be interpreted, but...
Yes, but paragraph 8, is that your choice of wording or
now?

1 can’t remember.

Is it more ofa Fujitsu party line whenit comes to
providing statements on extracting data?

There is - as far as witness statements, there are
no -- I’mnot aware of any party line, no,

‘Thank you. Can we please go to {E2/1/10} and we're back
in Mr Godeseth’s witness statement here. We looked at
the ARQ extraction rates over the years. At
paragraph 32, Mr Godeseth says:

43

“I am not aware of any instances where data
retrieved from the Audit Store differs from other
sources of data, nor am aware of any instances where
the integrity checks described in paragraph 30 have
revealed any issues.”

‘Those integrity checks are broadly similar to the
ones that you have outlined, but are you aware of any
instances where data retrieved from the audit store has
differed from other sources of data?

No, because I'm not aware of any other forms -- I'm not
involved in any areas of data storage.

So Fujitsu. wouldn't know that anyway?

Well, I can’t say that

Does Fujitsu keep list of any times when that might
happen?

I don't know.

It would be quite a useful thing to have though, for
Fujitsu's purposes, if they did have such a list,
wouldn't it?

Yes.

And I guess my second question is a bit overlapping with
the first, but are you aware of any instances where
integrity checks have revealed issues?

No, I’m not aware, no.

Not aware of any instances?

A. No.

Q. And again, Fujitsu don’t keepa list of any of these
times when it might have revealed issues?

A. Again, I don’t know.

Q. Can we please go to (F/1557}. Mr Dunks, this is
actually a Post Office document titled "Back Office
‘Transformation’, It is dated 22 October 2016. The

context -- there’s a little bit in that first part

there:
“This paper outlines the business case for the back
office transformation. An opportunity to_ significantly
improve our basic process and controls, whilst
simplifying the back office application landscape and
reducing our cost base.”
If we could please go to page 4 of that document
{F/1557/4}. Have you seen this document before,
Mr Dunks?
A. No.
Q. Now, there it says "Why do we need to transform?”
“Transformation in the back office is required due
to unsuitable processes and significant operational
risk
"The Post Office has been running the same
sub-optimal back office processes for many years”

If we go down a bit further

45

“Industry best processes exist that can, and will be
adopted”

And then 14:

“The back office is currently operating with a far
higher operational risk profile than is accepted by the
Post Office when making investment or project decisions
High proportion of manual accounting steps.”

And then the first arrow bullet point there:

“Lack of system audit trail between transactions”

What do you think that means?

A. I have no idea, 1 would be guessing

MR DE GARR ROBINSON: Is this a fair --

‘MR JUSTICE FRASER: Just - Mr De Garr Robinson.

I’mnot sure you can actually really pursue that
very much further with this witness given he has never
seen the document before.

MR MILETIC: I'm grateful, my Lord.

‘MR JUSTICE FRASER: Is it a phrase you have ever come across
before “lack of system audit trail"?

A. No.

‘MR MILETIC: I suppose the one question 1 would ask Mr Dunks
is: are you aware that Post Office had any concerns
regarding system audit trail as far back as 2016

A. No, because I’m notinvolved in that area at all

Q Tsee. I will move on.

If we could please go to {F/1716}. This is the
audit extraction client user manual, Presumably you are
very fai

with this document?
I haven't read it for a long time, but I’m aware of it,
yes.

So it’s not something that you really look to ona daily
basis?

No, it’s not.

When do you thinkis the last time you would have looked
at it?

A few years

A few years?

Yes.

The date of this document is 1 December 2017. It’s the
most recent version, as far as we're aware, but you're
hot sure either way probably whether it is or it isn’t,
is that fair?

No, not -- no.

If we could go please to page 9 of this document
{F/1716/9}, the introduction there:

“In addition to the historic data collected under
Horizon, the HNG-X system generates significant amounts
of data that is of interest to Post Office ~... Internal
Audit. and other groups.
“This document describes the Audit Extraction Client

47

application that is run on the Audit Workstations
the AE client provides functionality to manage [ARQs]
and to retrieve and process audit data from the
audit archive.”
It seems like an incredibly important document for
your job, doesn’t it, Mr Dunks?
Yes.
It is effectively a step-by-step guide on how to
contrary out data extraction?
I don't know. I can’t remember reading it but
You can’t remember reading. The definition there of
* filtering " under 3, do you see?
Mm-hm.
“Filtering is the process of searching the retrieved
audit files for specified FAD codes or strings in order
to select a subset of data for further processing.

e
user has the option of selecting the whole file in which
a match is found or of just selecting the matching
messages or records”

So filtering takes place obviously after you have
actually retrieved the files from the archive?
Yes, yes.
Under 4, "Audit Data Integrity", the second paragraph
there:

all times and controls have been established to provide
assurances to Post Office Internal Audit that this
integrity is maintained.”

That wording actually mirrors paragraph 5 of your
witness statement. Do you recognise that wording?
AL Yes
Q. And then it says:

“During audit data extractions the following
controls apply...”

Now, there are two there on that page which actually
mirror your 6.1 and 6.2 controls and then just over the
page please {F/1716/10}, the third one there matches

your paragraph 6.6

If we could please move forward to page 42 of this
manual (F/1716/42}, the section begins with "Validation
and Query”

“This tab will only be available if the following
conditions have been met:

"1. The retrieved data consists exclusively of TMS
and/or BRDB messages.

"2. Filtering has been performed.”

So this is now the data has been retrieved and now
we have been filtering , is that right?

A. Right, this is

retrieval , one is the fast and one is a slow one.

there would be two forms of data
This

49

is the historic one which I haven't used for quite
awhile, but yes, I believe so.

Q I see.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: Is this the slow one or the fast one?

‘A. It's the slower one.

‘MR JUSTICE FRASER: The slow one.

MR MILETIC: And if we could go over the page, please
{F/1716/43}, it says:

“TMS and BRDB messages are numbered in sequence for

each node. During filtering any retrieved audit message
data is analysed to determine what message sequences are
present in the data and whether there are any gaps or
duplicates in those sequences.

A gap in a message

sequence may indicate that a message is missing from the

audit data. Duplicates may indicate that an audit file
has been gathered twice.”

Taking those in turn, "a gap in a message sequence
may indicate that a message is missing from the audit
data”; that suggests that the underlying audit data is
incomplete, doesn't it, Mr Dunks?

A. I would say so, yes.
Q. But it uses the word "ma

so actually it might be the
case that it is the retrieval process that has caused
the gap?

A. I don't

~ no, I don't think -- I don’t know.

Q. So the use of the word "may", may just bea slip in
language there?

A. Quite possibly.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: Well, it could be any one of a number of
reasons.

MR MILETIC: Precisely, my Lord.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: But on the basis that the witness didn’t
draft it, I think he has agreed with your proposition to
the extent he can, but he also says he doesn’t know.

MR MILETIC: I'm grateful, my Lord.

And the second part there “duplicates may indicate
that an audit file has been gathered twice”, so that
would be an example of the processing
were describing before, potentially causing duplicates
to be gathered?

A. Yes, possibly

Q. And are you aware whether actually it might be the case
that duplicates were in the underlying data itself
rather than through the process?

the system you

A. I don't know, 1 can’t -- I don't know.

Q. Well, the diagram there shows what would happen in the
event that gaps and duplicates are found, and do you see
it says gaps found shown in red, duplicates found shown
in blue and in block capitals "Seek assistance from

audit support’, Now, on the face of that message

51

first of all, have you seen messages like this before
when you have retrieved data?

A. If I have it wasa long time ago. I"m not saying
T haven't, but it would have beena long time ago

Q. You may have done? Andon the face of it doesn't tell

you what the cause is of those gaps or duplicates, does

it?

No, I don't believe it does, no.

And you wouldn't know what the cause was?

No, I wouldn't know, no.

oPrer

And in block capitals it says "Seek assistance from
audit support”. Seek assistance from audit support, but
there’s no explanation as to what audit support might
do. What do audit support do in that circumstance?

A. I’massuming they would investigate the cause of the
gap.

Q. Doyou have any experience of when you have called audit
support and they have come back to you?

‘A. Possibly. I think I possibly -- yes, I think we have
raised PEAKs, whichis if this ‘we would raise an
issue via a PEAK for the audit team to investigate

Q. It’s. a problem, isn’t it, if gaps and duplicates are
found upon the retrieval process?

A. Yes, I think so

charges of false accounting and theft and you recall
that?

Yes.

Have you seen this witness statement of Gareth Jenkins
before?

No,

Could we please go to page 2 of this statement
(F/676/2},

“With Horizon counters, the mechanism by which data

In the first full paragraph it says:

is audited has always worked on the principle that it is

acceptable to audit the same data more than once

in
particular if in doubt as to whether or not it has been
previously audited successfully .
Horizon to retrieve the audit data took this into

The Mechanism used on

account and only presented one instance of such
duplicate data in the ARQextracts. The Audit Mechanism
cannot alter the base information and therefore
a re-running of the audit process will always produce
the same result.”

Does that accord with your understanding of how the
process of retrieving audit data worked in
Legacy Horizon?
Yes

Are you sure or is it

55

No, no, as far as I'mawareit extracts the data that’s
there and if I extract it again, it will bring out the
same data.

I see, so duplicates would not show up at that time?
When you say duplicates

Well, when it says:

*~.. only presented one instance of such duplicate
data in the ARQ extracts.”

As far as I’m concerned the data that -- it is very
process-driven, so we input the FAD code, the dates and
extract the data, and if I extracted it a second time,
it would bring back the same data, so I'm not aware, or
I don't know about duplicates it would bring back -- as
far as I’mconcerned, it brings back the same data.

I see. Mr Jenkins goes on to say:

“In January 2010 a new HNG-X application was
introduced to filter transaction records for
presentation to Post Office Limited. It has recently
been noticed that this HNG-X retrieval mechanism does
not remove such duplicates. An enhancement to the
extraction toolset will be developed, tested and
deployed and will remove such duplicate data in the
future. However until this enhancement is deployed,
there is a possibility that data is duplicated ”

Pausing there, do you recall this being an issue at

the time?
I vaguely remember it, yes
And he goes on to say

“The reliable way to identify a duplicate
transaction is to use the <Num> attribute that is used
to generate the unique sequence numbers. This will be
included in all future transaction record returns until
the retrieval mechanism is enhanced. A semi-automated
process to copy the returned data, and then to identify
and remove any duplicated records which may be present
from this copy by using the <NUM> attribute, has been
agreed with Post Office Limited for use in the interim
period.”

What that suggests is there was. period of time
when there was ~ it says semi-automated, a partly
manual process in removing duplicate records from ARQ
Does that accord with your memory?

It wasn’t in the process that we did when extracting the
data, I’m aware of that happening, whether it went

extracts .

on -- I don’t know the process of it, but it wasn't in
our daily process for extracting and removing any
duplicates

So where it says that there is a process agreed with
Post Office in the interim period for removing those

duplicate records, that’s not something that you were

87

involved in as the person extracting the data?
No.
And not anyone in the similar role to yours was involved
in that?
I don't believe so, no.
So there was effectively a separate department that was
taking care of that?
‘That was dealt with -- yes, not within our team.
I see. And it says there:

“A transaction log data dise has been produced as
exhibit PT/02 inthe trial of Seema Misra. The

transaction log data dise is made up of ARQs 436 to 448.

It should be noted that ARQ 447 which records the

transactions between 1 November 2007 to 30 November 2007

does contain some duplications of audited records.”

But then Mr Jenkins says:

“It is emphasised that [it doesn’t] ~...
[affect] actual physical transactions recorded on the
‘The duplication of records has...”

If we could turn the page:

oceurred during the auditing process when
records were in the process of being recorded purely for

to you?
Yes, it’s the sameas what's in my statement, yes
There's a slight difference in that it says improper use
of the computer rather than system, but the rest does
seem to match up?

Mm-hm.

But you hadn't seen this witness statement before?

No.

And you're not sure why it would largely replicate your
paragraph 8?

No, I mean, we do have a standard witness statement that
we produce for ARQs. When we supply ARQs we are
sometimes asked for a witness statement to go through
the process and verify as far as I’maware that the data
I supplied is accurate. Now, we use that quite a lot
and it may actually be in that statement.

I see. So when I asked you earlier whether it was
something of a Fujitsu party line you said you didn’t
think it was, but actually it looks as though it is on
the basis of what you have just told me and on this
document as well.

It could be. It may be part of our standard witness
statement that we supply.

And it’s not something you think about too much, that

specific section?

No.

It’s just template. You don't think about it, and you

Now, if we could please go to {F/573/1}. This is

‘a witness statement of Penelope Anne Thomas. Do you
know Mrs Thomas?

Yes, she used to be a colleague.

And have you seen this witness statement before?

No.

This is a witness statement also in Mrs Misra’s trial
and if you look at the first full paragraph, that
largely replicates your paragraph 3. She was
essentially performing the same role in terms of
providing evidence as you are here, is that fair?

Yes

And if we could turn to page 3 please {F/573/3}, and

final two sentences, in discussing the transaction
records, she says:

‘They therefore provide the ability to compare the
audit track record of the same transaction recorded in
two places to verify that systems were operating
correctly. Records of all transactions are written to
audit archive media.”

Nothing controversial there, do you agree?

Yes.
And just in passing, the two paragraphs below that where
it says:

“The Horizon system records time in GMT and takes no
account of Civil Time Displacements ...”
This is something we have actually heard some
evidence on earlier, but it’s correct, isn’t it, that
the audit data. six months of the year the time stamp

will be off by an hour?
Yes.
And at the bottom of that page, Penelope Thomas says:

“During audit data extraction the following controls
apply.”

And then over the page (F/573/4}, and she too lists
12 controls that aren’t entirely
match up to the controls that you have set out, for

they don’t entirely

example, one of the controls that I noted appears to be

61

sing is in your paragraph 6.9 where you said:

"Checks are made using the JSN that all audited
messages for each counter in the Branch ~..”

I will just let you find it if it would help?
Mm-hm.
“Checks are made using the JSN that all audited messages
for each counter in the Branch have been retrieved and
that no messages are missing.”

‘To your knowledge, was this an available control at
this time when Ms Thomas gave her statement?
I don’t know. I don't know.
So you don’t know when that control came into play?
No, I don't.
I see. Doyouthink if it was available it’s quite an
important check that Ms Thomas would have mentioned it?
Possibly
But it is quite difficult because she hasn't listed
where she derives those controls from either anda point
that we made earlier when looking at your witness
statement -- you said that you had listed 12 controls
effectively from recollection, or what you understand
them to be, but we can’t now verify that by looking at
any documents to see where those controls might appear
and when they were brought into force or not as the case
may be?

statement do actually apply as at today's date?

1 was trying to imply
that the data as far as I was concerned, when extracted,
was true and accurate to my best knowledge.

I -- on those checks -- those

Well, stopping just there, You're trying to imply the
result which is that the data is accurate, but the
question is very specific as to the content, the
existence of the controls that are in place. How did
you verify to yourself that those controls are actually
in place?
I was trying to imply that the data that I had extracted
hadn't -- from the date of -- from the time of being
extracted hadn't been manipulated or touched and when
you said before (inaudible) with the Post Office, and
controls to actually go in and log on and extract that
data, there were controls in place to do that

How did you know?

But can you actually be sure that the controls you
listed were in effect and were operating as at the time
you extracted the data?

To the best of my knowledge, yes. Yes.

I see

I had no reason to doubt it.

63

Even though you didn’t confirm it through any documents?
No.

I see. And over the page, please, {F/573/5}. Ms Thomas
there just describes that she wasin fact the one that
extracted the records in relation to Mrs Misra so we

see:

“ARQs 436 to 448 .... were received on
26 February 2010 ..”

It goes on to say:

“I produce a copy .. as exhibit PT/O1
extractions of data held on the Horizon system in
accordance with the requirements of ARQs 436 to 448
and followed the procedure outlined above. I produce
the resultant CD as Exhibit PT/02. This CD, Exhibit

PT/02, was sent to the Post Office Investigation section

I undertook

by Special Delivery on 4 March ~..”
Do you recall that PT/02 was the exhibit that

Gareth Jenkins in his witness statement was talking

about?

I'm-- with it being called the same, I’m assumingit is

the same.

Yes, and he, in that statement, referred to ARQ 447

containing duplicate records and then needing to be

removed. I can take you back if you would like to see

that section?

1 A. No, that’s fine.

2 Q. So then Ms Thomas sets out:

3 ‘This report is formatted with the following

4 headings.”

5 And then over the page, please (F/573/6}:

6 “The Event report is formatted with the following

7 headings.”

8 Now she doesn't mention anywhere there that ARQ 447

9 contained duplicate records, does she? I can give you
10 a moment to look at that section.
11 A. No.
12  Q. And then the paragraph immediately below it, that again
13 is your paragraph 8 although this time word-for-word is
14 the same as your paragraph 8, isn’t it?
15 A. Yes.
16 Q. Andit is consistent with your answer earlier that this
17 is a sort of template Fujitsu. witness statement document
18 that is provided and you sign
19 A. Yes.
20 Q. -- just to show that the extraction has been okay?
21 Ms Thomas not identifying duplicates in ARQ 447,
22 that's slightly problematic, isn’t it, to either
23 Post Office or an SPM that is trying to look at
24 anomalies and compare sources of data? That's not very
25 helpful, is it?
65
1 A. Thestatement again is to verify the integrity of the
2 data once extracted and given. We don’t control what's
3 in the data, Our process is about extracting it and
4 securely passing it over to the Post Office. It’s not
5 our concern of what's in the data
6 Q It’s not your concern what's in the data?
7A. No, it’s whatwe're -- we're process-driven to extract
8 certain types of data for certain requests
9 Q. And so whether or not that might match another record or
10 not, or replicate or duplicate or have gaps, that’s not
1. part of your remit, that’s not really part of your
12 concern?
13. A. No, it’s not.
14 Q. I see. So reading that and reading the paragraph 8 as,
15 it wasin your witness statement, it doesn’t give much
16 comfort to somebody that’s then trying to rely on ARQ
17 data as being a gold standard to compare and investigate
18 anomalies, does it?
19 A. Possibly not
20 Q. Are you aware, Mr Dunks, of any other specific issues
21 with the retrieval of audit data that may have impacted
22 disputes between Post Office and subpostmasters or
23 subpostmistresses?
24 A. Not that I can -- not that I can recall would cause
25 those issues, no.

Could we please look at (F/829}. This is a PEAK,
PCO211833, and do you see under "Summary" it says:
“Audit Retrieval for ARQ Returns Missing Reversal
Indicator ”
Do you see that field?
Yes.
And then under “Impact Statement” in capitals
"Service on stop .. ARQ returns for HNGX
transaction records must stop until resolution
Analysis must identify returns which may require
re- retrieval ”
Do you recall a particular issue in terms of
reversals and audit retrieval?
No. At that time, Penny managed the ARQ retrieval
process and she -- that washer main priority and her
main job, so I wasn’t -- I wouldn't have been
1 wouldn’t have seen this issue, or been made aware of
these issues
You would not have been made aware of this issue at all?
No.
Even though you are the person that’s extracting data?
No. With our team we had a number of different roles
and audit extraction is one of those roles, which is
process driven, so -- and Penny would have managed that

via this PEAK. I wasn't aware of -- and if I was,

67

I certainly don't remember.
And if we could go over to page 2 please {F/829/2}. Do
you see that bottom box there? If we look down at

“Impact on operations” -- well, if we start at the top

it say
“Specify the HNG-X platforms impacted”
Do you see that?

Yes.

And it says:

“The platform has been specified and it is the Audit
Server.

“Technical summary: the spreadsheets presented in
support of prosecution at court miss out an indication
as to whether or not a transaction is a reversal ””

And then further down do you see "Impact on
operations *

Yes.
‘There again it says:

“Spreadsheets supplied by the prosecution team miss
out an indication as to whether a transaction is
a reversal”

It says

“The prosecution team are well aware of the
problems; we hope to have a release out in a few days;

a KELis therefore not required.”

Day 7

1 Just over the page please (F/829/3}, and it says
2 "Risks (of releasing and of not releasing proposed
3 fix )
4 “There are few risks with this fix. It must be got
5 out or prosecution evidence is incomplete”
6 And then there is a description there of queries.
7 being changed in order to show reversals, and this is
8 taking place now this PEAK from -- August 2011 is when
9 this problem was identified, but you say you were never
10 made aware of it and presumably you weren't aware either
1. of queries being changed subsequently?
12. A. I don't recall this, no.
13  Q. Andonthe final page, please, of this document
14 (F/829/5}, there is a final message there saying:
15 “Fix deployed; all appears to be operating as
16 required. Closing call. Many thanks to all, Penny.”
17 So it is fair to say that up until August 2011, the
18 dara that you were retrieving did not have an indicator
19 as to whether or not reversals had taken place?
20 A. Correct, yes.
21 Q. Doyousee that as detracting somewhat from this being
22 a secure gold standard record to be compared with other
23 sources?
24 A. I honestly can’t say whether that has an implication on

25 that at all or -- that data missing has an implication

69
1 on that at all, I don’t know.
2 Q. It’s not in your remit, it’s not in your concern?
3A. No, no.
4 Q. Were you in court on Monday when Mrs van den Bogerd was
5 being cross-examined?
6 A. Yes
7 Q. Did youhear a reference to something that was referred
8 to as the Helen Rose report?
9 A. Tdon't recall it but
10 Q. It’s a very short point I was going to make, but
1. actually perhaps it is fair to take the witness to the
12 document very briefly

13. MRJUSTICE FRASER: It depends what the point is, I suppose.
14 MRMILETIC: Well, the short point is this but actually it

15 might be, Mr Dunks, that you simply don’t know the

16 answer to this either, so the point that I was going to

17 make is that it wasn’t until the summer of 2013, at the

18 time of the Helen Rose report, that in actual fact it

19 was identified to be a problem that the reversal

20 indicator didn’t show whether it was system or

21 user-generated, but is that something that is outside of

22 your knowledge?

23 A. Yes

24 Q. Very well. I won't go to that point then:

documents and looked at various problems that existed
with ARQ data when it was retrieved, can you just
explain to the court why those things, or a semblance of
those issues were not set out candidly in your witness
statement?

>

Sorry, I don't understand,

Q. So wehave just been through several documents and
several issues in terms of when audit data is retrieved
and the problems in relying on that data, but none of
that is set out in your witness statement, and is there
a particular reason as to why that might be?

A. Again, the -- what! was trying to convey with our

witness statements, as I believe

the data once we have extracted it, and then supplied it
to the Post Office, and the controls around the

is the integrity of

extraction, not the data itself

QI see, so whatyou are not saying in your witness
statement is that the data then is accurate and reliable
in terms of use for disputes between subpostmasters and
Post Office?

A. No, I can’t say that at all
MR MILETIC: You can't say that?
My Lord, I have no further questions.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: Mr De Garr Robinson?
Re examination by MR DE GARR ROBINSON

‘That's fair.

MR DE GARR ROBINSON: Mr Dunks, I would just like you to
look at your witness statement please, paragraph 8. You
were asked a question about this paragraph and you were
asked -- it was suggested to you that you didn’t really
think about that paragraph much and I would just like to
take you through it (E2/10/3}. In the first sentence
you say:

“There is no reason to believe that the information
in this statement is inaccurate because of the improper
use of the system.”

Mr Dunks, is that sentence true or is it not true?

A. It is —- well, it’s true. I don’t believe -- there's no
reason to believe that it is inaccurate at all

Q. And did you think about that sentence when you signed
the statement?

A. It wasn't in the forefront of my mind when I was signing
the statement, no.

Q. The next sentence:

“To the best of my knowledge and belief at all

material times the system was operating properly, or if

not, any respect in which it was not operating property,
or was out of operation was not such as to effect the
information held within it”
Is that sentence true?
AL Yes.

Questions by MR JUSTICE FRASER
MR JUSTICE FRASER: Ihave just got a question.
You started doing your current role in 2002, is that

right? I think it is in paragraph 3, you say.

A. I have worked within this team since then, but the roles
have changed within that over that period of time.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: What were you doing before 2002?

A. Iwas there were different roles again within then
ICL, from desktop support, et cetera

MR JUSTICE FRASER: And when did you start at ICL, do you
remember?

A. Good question. About 21 years ago.

‘MR JUSTICE FRASER: 1998?

AL Yes

‘MR JUSTICE FRASER: You are trying to catch me out with some
mental maths.

I don’t have any questions other than that.

I assume there's nothing arising out of that. Thank you

Q. Now, the later statements clarify and in some respects
correct matters that are set out in the earlier
statement. Subject to those clarifications and
corrections, and subject to the two corrections you saw
in the front sheet at tab 7, do you confirm that these
witness statements are true to the best of your
knowledge, recollection and belief?

AL Ido.

Q. Now, Mr Godeseth, I've got a question I would like to
ask you arising from evidence that’s just been given by
Mr Dunks, and with your Lordship’s permission ..?

MR JUSTICE FRASER: Yes.

MR DE GARR ROBINSON: If we could go to (F/1716} please and
could we go to page 43 of that document (F/1716/43).
‘This is a Fujitsu document. It’s the Audit Extraction
Client User Manual

AL Yes.

Do you see that?

Q. Now, just remind me, how long have you been working for
Fujitsu?

A. Since 2010.

Q. And since that time, have you had any familiarity with

the audit extraction process and its reliability and so

on, and is:

surrounding it?

A. [have clearly been aware that audit extracts have been
happening, but I have not been intimately involved in
that process until more recently.

Q I see.
the page it says:

I would like to ask you about -- at the top of
TMS and BRDB messages are numbered in sequence for

each node, During filtering any retrieved audit message

data is analysed to determine what message sequences are

present in the data and whether there are any gaps or

duplicates in those sequences. A gap in a message

sequence may indicate that a message is missing from the

audit data. Duplicates may indicate that an audit file

has been gathered twice.”
1 would just like to ask you a couple of questions

about that. If there had beena gap in a message
sequence during the extraction process that’s described
here, is that something that you would know about?

A. I believe so, yes, because it would bea highly serious
problem.

Q. Andean I ask you whether there have been any such gaps
during the time that you have been at Fujitsu?

A. I’mcertainly not aware of any, and I’m confident that

duplicates: what would have happened? Would you be
aware if there were any duplicates?

Could I ask you the same question about

Having seen Gareth’s statement, I would say that
duplicates are probably being misinterpreted here,
because if a record goes into the audit trail twice it’s
simply two copies of the same record. As long as that's

dealt with, I don't think that’s a problem,
9 MRJUSTICE FRASER: When you say duplicates are being

10 misinterpreted here, do you mean in this document, in
1. Mr Jenkins’ document, or in what you are being asked?
12. A. I think here the issue is -- I clearly understand that
13 the claimants are interested, my Lord, in whether
14 transactions got duplicated, and I think what goes into
15 the audit is a record which has come from a counter,
16 different mechanisms in Riposte and also in the newer
17 Horizon system. 1 think whatMr Jenkins is referring to
18 is that a record can be written to an audit trial twice
19 and as long as you spot that and you deal with it,
20 that’s fine, because it is simply saying, it is
21 simply: 1 wrote down the same thing twice. And the
22 circumstances in which I have some recollection of is
23 that the audit trail got written to Bootle and to Wigan,
24 our separate data centres in the days of Riposte, so
25 clearly I would havea copy of a record in both Bootle
7

1 and Wigan,

2 MRJUSTICE FRASER: I'm not sure that necessarily answers my

3 question.

4A. Sorry, my Lord.

5 MR JUSTICE FRASER: When you said duplicates are being

6 misinterpreted, do you mean misinterpreted in this

7 Fujitsu document, interpreted insofar as you understand

8 what Mr Jenkins is saying, or misinterpreted in the

9 question that Mr De Garr Robinson asked you?
10 A. I think here I'm saying that duplicates may indicate
11 that an audit file has been gathered twice is --

17 MR DE GARR ROBINSON: "The suggestion here that duplicates
18 may indicate that an audit file has been gathered

21 MR DEGARR ROBINSON: Yes, I have just read out the

In this Fujitsu document. I think that is entirely

A. I think it is important to go back to understand what
the audit trail is looking to do, and I think 1 would
like to start by describing the Horizon Online system
which I'm more familiar with, and the audit trail in my
book is I’m trying to write down, transaction by
transaction what is coming from a counter and I am
keeping a record of effectively the transaction as
entered at the counter as closely as I can possibly make
it

In the Horizon Online, the big protection there is

a thing called the JSN which is the Journal Sequence

Number, and we use this to indicate that -- or to prove
that I have not missed any records and I haven't got any
duplicates. So built into the system at the BOWL(?), we
get a sequence of messages coming up from the counter to
the BOWL, and these all have a JSN in them, and these
are checked to make sure that they just increment by
one.

In the Riposte system, there was a very similar
concept, but this was the message number on the messages
coming froma particular counter, and again, by checking
that I've got a -- whatwe call a dense list which says
I've got every number accounted for, and I -- if I have
duplicates, and they both say the same thing, that is

just the fact that I have written something down twice

79

and I imagine from what I have read in Gareth’s
statement that this obviously happened in Riposte days
when there were data centres in Wigan and Bootle and
I know that audit trails were written in both centres,
but I think by then saying "Okay, I have now written
some things down twice, but I can recognise those
because they have the same message number", they are
simply copies of the same thing.

MR DE GARR ROBINSON: My Lord, I'm at the margins of my own
understanding of the system and think I had better
stop now.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: Well, I'm actually just go to pursue
this on your behalf, because your question was quite
simple and it has led to an answer of about a page and
a quarter, so I’m just going to ask the same question.

What Mr De Garr Robinson asked you was if duplicates
were being produced in audited extractions, is that
something that Fujits would be interested in knowing?
And I’m unclear as to what the answer is

A. Yes. Sorry, yes, my Lord.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: The answer is yes?

AL Yes.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: Right.

If you want to ask a follow-up question,

We would be interested in knowing because we would

MR DE GARR ROBINSON: Are you aware of -- since your time at

but since your time at Fujitsu, are you aware of this
issue having arisen in relation to extracting audit
data, duplicates?

A. No, my Lord.

‘MR JUSTICE FRASER: Mr Green, your turn.

Cross-examination by MR GREEN

MR GREEN: Iwill start at the beginning of your statement,
if I may,MrGodeseth. If we canlook at (E2/1/1). You
explain in paragraph 1 that you are employed at Fujitsu
Services Limited as the chief architect on the
Post Office account.

A. 1 am, my Lord.

Q. And you say you are authorised to make this statement on
behalf of Post Office Limited in the proceedings
right, isn't it, that you were first employed by
Post Office?

It is

A. I was employed by Post Office from 1987 for a number of
years

Q. Let's have a look at paragraph 5 of your witness

‘Then if we go over the page:

“I joined the Post Office IT department
in November 1987 to work on a project to introduce
technology into Post Office branches.”
What project was that?

A. I know it as the Thames Valley pilot. It was a project
to introduce -- we supported three products in those
days, it was Girobank, DVLA and National Savings,

a pilot in the Thames Valley area which had about 250
offices .

Q. Then at paragraph 6 we see you worked as the technical
advisor to Post Office when they and the Benefits Agency
procured the Horizon system.

A. That's correct, my Lord.

Q. It was unusual asa project; it was being procured by
two different government bodies, wasn’t it?
the Department for Social Security, Benefits Agency, on
the one side and then there was Post Office at that time

I was working asa contractor for Post Office. My
contract came to an end, and I joined Fujitsu on
contract.
But when you say “as a contractor”, do you mean as an
independent contractor
Yes.

rather than employee?
I joined Fujitsu initially as a contractor and then
in November, laccepted a full -time role
And just so we havea vague idea, for what proportion of
your time with Post Office were you employed, and for
what proportion of the time were you an independent
contractor?
I became an independent contractor in 2005, just as
Impact Programme was going live.
Just as ..?
‘The Impact Programme was going live.

Can you explain to the court what the Impact Programme

83

was?
The impact -- the major change in the Impact Programme
delivered was to take out the old cash account and
replace it with branch trading statements, but there
were a few other changes implemented at the same time.
Now, you effectively have worked for both Post Office
and Fujitsu_and have been involved in pretty much the
entire history of the Horizon system in different ways,
haven't you?

1 was — pretty much, but I was not involved in the
early days of the roll-out of Horizon, so when

1 finished my stint on the procurement, I worked
elsewhere in the Post Office, then came back to

Post Office counters to deal with banking and since then
I think my time has been pretty much with Post Office
counters. I hada break in 2009 before coming back for
a short contract with Post Office counters and then
joining Fujitsu

Right
so forth in a minute, but just clarifying the
construction of your witness statement, your first
witness statement which we're looking at, which is the

We will come to the introduction of Horizon and

one of 27 September 2018, broadly covers the accuracy of
audit data and the issue of remote access for both

Legacy Horizon and Horizon Online, is that fair?

It is, yes.
And at paragraph 7 of that witness statement {E2/1/2},
if you just look at that for a moment, do you see at the
bottom of that paragraph it says:

“I therefore have consulted with colleagues who work
in the areas that are covered by this statement to
ensure that my understanding of them is correct.”

Which were the areas that you were referring to
there?
Basically any area that I wanted to just double check,
s0 I don’t see it as anything specific. I work with
a number of people and if I’m uncertain of anything, or
just want to check up, then I would talk to them,
So you were sufficiently uncertain about certain things
to have to go and speak to a number of your colleagues?
1 wouldn't say “uncertain
checking
Who were the colleagues you spoke to?
Off the top of my head, would say Steve Parker and

It is due diligence, double

a couple of guys in his area; Pete Jobson,
Gareth Seemungal, Alan Holmes, Jon Hulme.
Could you just help the court just in relation to each
of those, what were the aspects they were contributing
to your statement, could you just explain?

In Steve Parker's area, certainly there are people who

85

have longer
worked. Gareth Seemungal,I talked to about BRDB and

or recollections of how Riposte actually
how Oracle works. Pete Jobson I talked to about how
batch systems work. Alan Holmes knows a fair amount
about audit. Jon Hulme, knows the counter pretty well
Right, that’s helpful. Let's look at paragraph 34
please on page 11 (E2/1/11}. We see there “Audit data
Legacy Horizon”

You say:

“In Legacy Horizon Riposte, a messaging system, was
responsible for storing all data in Post Office branches
and replicating it to data centres

As I was on ‘the
other side of the fence”
Because you were working with Post Office at the

time:

when Riposte was in use I have consulted with
my former colleague, Gareth Jenkins, to prepare this
section of my statement.”

Yes?
Yes.
And in fact we see Mr Jenkins’ name ina number of other
paragraphs throughout your witness statement?
Yes.
And it is fair to say that really the source of that
information that you're giving is Mr Jenkins, isn’t it,

because you were working for Post Office at the time?
I feel I hada pretty good knowledge of how Riposte
works, since I needed it when I was working on Impact,
but it’s absolutely the case that I would get more
detailed information from Gareth.

Because in a number of paragraphs -- 1 mean, just give
us a couple of examples, At paragraph 38 you say:

“I understand from Gareth that each message included
three key pieces of information...”

And if we go to paragraph 39, over the page
{E2/1/12}

“I also understand from Gareth that messages also
had an associated "Expiry Date’ ..”

Paragraph 41:

“I understand from Gareth that due to the size of
the Post Office network [they] were split into four
separate clusters

Ando forth. Paragraph 43:

“I understand from Gareth that the audit application
read every record that was visible to the correspondence
server...”

Paragraph 44 {E2/1/13}

“I also understand from Gareth that once these files
had been written they became visible to the audit server

which would pick them up ..”

87

I'm obviously not going to keep going, but that's.
information you have obtained from Mr Jenkins, isn’t it?
It’s difficult to judge how much I knew beforehand, but
certainly talking to Gareth has freshened up my
understanding of it
I suggest to you it is mostly Mr Jenkins’ explanations
to you which you seem to think
1 would certainly regard Gareth as an expert on Riposte,
having far more knowledge aboutit at a practical level
than I have.
He is the most obvious person to talk about it in
a sense, isn’t he?
Yes.
And let's look, if we may please, at page 16 of your
first witness statement (E2/1/16}. This falls under
a heading called “Balancing Transactions” which has been
given an acronym of "BTSs",
Yes.
We will come back to that. But just for the moment,
just to orientate you where you are in the statement, if
you look -- I'msorry, Mr Godeseth, I didn’t spot you
didn’t have any water.

Horizons Issues - Alan Bates & Others v Post Office Limited Day 7

“A small group of Fujitsu users from the Software
SupportCentre .. (30 users) have the ability to inject
additional transactions into a branch's accounts in

called a Balancing Transaction”

Now, pausing there, we heard Mr Roll being
cross-examined and it was suggested to him that within
si

9 experience Mr De Garr Robinson went into with Mr Roll,

1
2
3
4 Horizon Online, using a designed piece of functionality
5

there were about 25 members who were -- whose

10 and then five sort of super elite members, as they were
1. described by Mr De Garr Robinson.

120 A. Mmhm.

13° Q. That's a total of 30. Is that about the same size as
14 the department is now? Is 30 users the whole of SSC?
15 A. I wouldn’tknow. Steve would be able to give a far

16 better — but I -- 1 think there was about that number

17 of people there, yes.
18 Q. So Mr Parker would be the person who knows, and you
19 think it's probably about the whole of SSC?
20 A. Yes.
21 Q. So when we just look at the words:
22 “A small group of Fujitsu users from the Software
23 Support Centre.”
24 It’s actually probably the whole or most of the
25 Software Support Centre?
89
1A. Mmhm.
2 Q. Everyone, it looks like?
3. AL Yes:
4 Q._ If wecome down to paragraph 589, just go over the page
5 (£2/1/17}, that’s -- that all seems to be dealing with
6 Horizon Online and then at 58.10 you say:
7 "In Legacy Horizon, any transactions injected by SSC
8 would have used the computer server address as the
9 counter position which would be a number greater than
10 32, so it would be clear that a transaction had been
1. injected in this way”
12 Yes? That's what you said in that first witness
13 statement.
14 A. That’s what I said in that statement, correct.
15 Q. Now, just pausing there, you don’t say who you got that
16 from, but did that come from Mr Jenkins?
17 A. Yes. The greater than 32 came from Mr Jenkins, correct
18 Q. So wecould write in there "I understand from Gareth"?
19 A. Yes.
20 Q. Andin fact if we go back to paragraph 36 on page 11
a1 {E2/1/11}, it is effectively mirroring the overall
22 description that the node ID associated with an injected
23 message would be that of the correspondence server at
24 which the message had been injected, and not a normal
25 counter node ID, and therefore would have been clearly

visible in any audit data.

Yes.

‘That's the same point but without using the number 32,
yes? It’s a broader point, but it captures the point
that you're making in 58.10 and is consistent with ic
‘There were a number of mechanisms for the-- I think the
preferred route for injecting any transactions would
always be to do it at the correspondence server. There
were occasions where it was necessary to inject messages
at the counter. I think that was the point that Mr Roll
was making in identifying that messages had to be
inserted to correct problems at the counter, and there
are a few instances where clearly that happened.

Yes. Ando can I just ask you, did you get this
section in 36 also from Mr Jenkins, broadly?

Yes.

And then just going forward in your third witness
statement at (E2/14/7], paragraph 25 -- I’m so sorry.

If you look at paragraph 25 you say:

“In paragraph 58.10 of my first statement I stated
that any transactions injected by SSC in Legacy Horizon
would have used the computer server address as the
counter position which would be a number greater than
32. I have read Parker 2 and I am now aware that it was

also possible for SSC to insert transactions with

91

a counter position with a number less than 32. I did
not discuss this in my first statement because I was not
aware of it”

That's correct.

So at what point did you realise that it was not
correct?

When it was brought to my attention at the time that
Steve was preparing his second statement.

Were you a bit shocked about that, to find it was wrong?
“Shocked” would be too strong a word. It was -- I was
finding out a detail that I didn’t know before.

You were finding out a detail that you didn’t know
before in quite a controversial area, weren't you?

It was clearly an area that was going to be of interest
because of the fact that we were inserting transactions
into Riposte. It wasan operational necessity and it
was done ina controlled way. I had believed that the
way that transactions were being injected would give
them a counter position greater than 32 because the
correspondence servers basically had nodes or addresses
which were above 32, there was a special address for the
gateway server, there wasa special address for the
extra dise in a single position branch andI had
basically expected messages to be introduced using

a different counter position and having read a whole

Q.
A

number of PEAKs,I can quite clearly see that the
standard practice in Fujitsu was to label something
which was being inserted into Riposte so as to make it
as clear as possible that it was not being done— it
was being done as something out of the ordinary, it was
being inserted because of a problem.

So we had techniques for doing that. You could put
in an attribute because this wouldn't be visible to
a subpostmaster, I fully understand that, but it would
be visible in the audit trail , when you ever come back
to pull out the audit trail, you could put in an
attribute to say “This was done under PEAK 75°
Subpostmasters would never see that. They would not see
it in their account in their branches and I’m fully
aware that that is the case. It wasa better audit than
Mr Roll was alluding to when he said that it was left in
a PINICL, because that would have been an audit which is
separate from the actual data that we would be looking
at should we ever need to pull stuff out of the audit
trail and the intention was always to makeit as clear
as possible that this had been done under exceptional
circumstances.

‘The techniques used to makeit as visible to the
subpostmaster as possible would be to put in references
which referred to a counter that didn’t exist in the

93

branch, such as -- I sawa technique described in

a number of cases which said put in a -- you know, if
you are correcting something for counter 1, call it
counter 11; if you're correcting something for counter
2, call it counter 12. These things would have been
visible to a subpostmaster and the reason that you had
to do it that way was to make sure that these
transactions also got picked up and dealt with because
these were legitimate counter numbers.

If I start to put in data with a number which is not
a legitimate counter number then it’s going to be
ignored by systems further down the track
So which were legitimate counter numbers?
Up to 32
Right, so you say less than 32 in your witness statement
at paragraph 25
Sorry, I may have got that
whether 32 was a legitimate

the boundary was at 32;

Don't worry about that. That's not -- that’s not

counter or not, I don't know.

‘MR JUSTICE FRASER: Please don’t talk over each other.
MR GREEN: I'm so sorry.

Don't worry about the boundary. So the short point
is that you learned, when Mr Parker was preparing his
second witness statement, that it wasin fact possible

Q

to inject transactions which a subpostmaster would not
know about at the counter rather than at the
correspondence server, you learned that for the first
time?

1 cannot see how a subpostmaster would not have been
aware of these transactions being injected, because
there's a technical rationale why the subpostmaster had
to be in his branch -- sorry, it didn’t necessarily have
to be the subpostmaster, it had to be somebody in the
branch who was logged on when these techniques were used
to inject transactions at the counter and the simple
reason is that if you didn’t have somebody logged on,
then Riposte would have generated a message with a blank
user ID. Riposte was responsible for actually wrapping
the message that we were looking fo insert at the
counter, and in doing that, Riposte will tell you the
counter ID, or technically it wasa stream, it would
pick up the user ID, it would pick up the time, so this
was effectively the envelope which wrapped the payload
that we were looking to inject .

If there was no user logged on at the counter then
Riposte would introduce a blank user ID and that would
be picked up in later processing.

But let's take it in stages, if we may.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: Just before you do.

A

95

Mr Green is going to be putting quite precise
questions to you. I knowit’s an understandable human
reaction to want to argue wider points, but I would like
you to listen to his questions and answer his questions
please.

Yes, my Lord.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: Right, Mr Green,
MR GREEN: Can we separate what you can do from what you

have inferred was done in many cases from PEAKs you have
looked at, and let's focus on what could be done.

You realised for the first time that it was possible
to inject or insert a transaction with a counter
position less than 32 when Mr Parker was preparing his
second statement?

Correct.

And you knew that that was a contentious issue in this
litigation , yes?

Yes.

And if we can go back please to paragraph 58.10 of
(£2/1/16}. Go over the page please to 10 {E2/1/17}
there it says:

“In Legacy Horizon, any transactions injected by SSC
would have used the computer server address as the
counter position which would bea number greater than
32, so it would be clear that a transaction had been

injected in this way”
Can we go back to the previous page just to get the

introduction to that {£2/1/16}. It's not immediately

clear from this part of your statement that you got that

information from Mr Jenkins, is it, 58.10?

Sorry, I'mlooking at 58.7 here?

Yes, I'm just showing you~

I agree, yes

So what had actually happened to you is that you had had

a conversation with Mr Jenkins, he had given you the

information on a contentious point in the litigation ,

and youhad repeated it in a way that could be read as

sounding as if you knew aboutit yourself?

That was certainly not deliberate.

No, but I’m just saying that is whathad happened?

I can accept that

And then you found out that was wrong. Did you go back

and talk to Mr Jenkins about it?

I don't think I have, no

Were you not interested to find out from him directly

whether they always used counter numbers other than

those in use by the SPM, rather than inferring matters

from PEAKs as you have suggested?

I have not discussed it further with Gareth.

So you are not in a position to comment on that beyond

97

what you have inferred from the PEAKs?
I think that’s fair, yes.

Now, it would be possible, would it not, to use

a counter number of 1, or 2, or 3?

It would,

And if that counter number was a counter number actually
in use by the SPM, it would appear to the SPM, from the
records they could see, that it wasa transaction which
had been done in their branch, by them or their
assistants?

Yes.

Now, you were at Post Office at the time that

Legacy Horizon wasn use, weren't you?

I was certainly at the Post Office when Legacy Horizon
was in use.

You hada break, I think you mentioned earlier. Was
that around 2009?

In 20091 finished my contract with Post Office counters
in roughly June, and went back to Post Office counters
in the following January, so I hada six-month gap.
And apart from that were you continuously working for
Post Office from 1987 to when you left and joined
Fujitsu?

No. I think it’s covered in my opening statement, that

I was - from Post Office I was outsourced to a company

called Xansa, and then after a couple of years
probably two and a half years at Xansa, I decided to go
independent.
So when you were outsourced to Xansa
1 continued in roughly the same role.

you continued
Royal Mail IT department outsourced, or were you

did you remain an employee of

outsourced so that you went and worked for someone else
with a direct relationship with them?

I was outsourced from Royal Mail to Kansa as part of

a rationalisation programme, so therefore I was employed
by Xansa, 1 was paid by Xansa.

I understand. So apart from that period and the short
break you had in 2009 that you have described, the
six-month break which began in 2009, you were at

Post Office effectively throughout the period from 19872
1 was at Post Office, 1 was working actively on the

Post Office account for most of that time, but, as

I say, once the procurement of Horizon with ICL Pathway
had come toa sensible juncture, I did spend some time
working with other parts of Post Office, Parcelforce,
the Television Licence Agency and such. So there was

a gap in my time alongside Post Office counters.

In the light of your time and position and role within
Post Office, would you have been regarded as

99

a knowledgeable person within Post Office about whether
remote access of the type we're talking about was
possible?
I believe I would have been regarded as a knowledgeable
person.
Very knowledgeable?
Yes, I would like to think so.
And it is your evidence to the court that you were
completely unaware that inserting transactions in this
way was possible throughout your time at Post Office?
‘To be honest, 1 wouldn't have actually thought about it.
If you are looking to supporta large system, then
I think the logical conclusion is it’s inevitable that
you have to do this sort of thing on occasion.
So if you had been asked whether it was likely that it
would be possible, you would have said
Yes.

it’s inevitable because it's a large system?
I think so, yes.
So were you a bit surprised when Mr Jenkins told you
when you were preparing your first witness statement
that it would not be possible to do it unless it was
done just to the correspondence server?
1 don't think he told methat. I think that is his --
his description to me was afar more generic one rather

than going into that level of detail

Q. But wasn't the key point that you were giving evidence
about whether or not it would be identifiable as not
having been done by the subpostmaster?

A. I think we were really talking about messages coming in
at the correspondence server which would therefore be
very different from the ones coming from the counter
which would have the lower counter numbers or node
numbers,

Q. The short point is, Mr Godeseth, that your original
witness statement was -- paragraph 58.10, if we can just
look at that finally {E2/1/17}
clearly designed to suggest that it would not be
possible to insert transactions as Mr Roll was
suggesting, wasn't it?

A. I don't see that as the intention at all

Paragraph 58.10 was

1 think there

I was looking to describe -- I think the intention was
to describe that transactions injected by the SSC would
be different from transactions done by the counter.

Q. Well, that’s not quite what you say. This is my last
question on this, I think. You say:
“In Legacy Horizon, any transactions injected by SSC

would have used the computer server address as the

counter position which would be a number greater than

32, so it would be clear that a transaction had been

101

injected in this way”

AL Yes.

Q. Youwere specifically ruling out injection of
transactions in a way that the subpostmaster could see,
weren't you?

‘A. Sorry, could you repeat the question?

Q. That form of words you have used was specifically ruling
out the injection of transactions in a way that
a subpostmaster could not see?

A. I think there are too many negatives in this

Q. The effect of what you were saying there was that any --
wecan read “all” -- transactions injected by SSC would
have hada number greater than 322

AL Yes

Q. And that would makeit clear that a transaction had been
injected?

AL Yes

Q. What you were trying to say by that was it was not
possible for transactions to be injected which would not
be clear that they had been injected?

‘A. I would still say that transactions that have been
injected are clearly identifiable , albeit there may bea
convoluted route to identifying them.

MR GREEN: My Lord, is that a convenient moment?

‘MR JUSTICE FRASER: I think it probably is. We will come

back at 2 o'clock.
Mr Godeseth, you are in the middle of giving your

evidence so you're not allowed to talk to anybody about
the case over the short adjournment. Come back at
2 o'clock.

(1.03 pm)

(The luncheon adjournment)

(2.01 pm)

MR GREEN: Mr Godeseth, can we look at the introduction of
Horizon itself , paragraph 6 of your witness statement at
{E2/1/2}

advisor in the procurement of the Horizon system and

We have mentioned already you were technical

touched on the fact that it was unusual because it was
two different government entities
It was not uncontroversial, this project, at the

time, was it?

A. Sorry, it was-- certainly it was an interesting project
to be working on, so I'mnot sure...

Q. Well, let's take it in stages. It encountered quite
a lot of difficulties as a project, didn’t it?

AL Yes.

Q. And its sort of birth as a system was not entirely easy,
is that fair?

A. I think that probably the relationship between Post

Office, Benefits Agency and the contractual situation is

fairly well-known, yes.
Q. And if you can very kindly look at {F/70} as an example.
This is a Computer Weekly article, 1 November 2000, and
you will see there it says:

“The infamous 1996-1999 Pathway project aimed to
computerise the nation’s post offices and tackle benefit
fraud, But 18 months later, after losing millions and
destroying reputations a credible IT project has
emerged?

So although, as we will see, the problems were
well-known, as you have fairly accepted, a credible IT
project did emerge from it?

Mm-hm.
Which was what we now know as Horizon?
Yes.

oPror

And the article then, in paragraph 2, notes:
“It was one of the largest roll outs in Europe-..
despite its complexities, it is now running smoothly, on

time and to budget”

‘That was the impression they had. And the NAO had
had some concerns about money wasted on the aborted
attempt for the swipe card system, yes?

A. I mustadmit! have no recollection of what the swipe
card system would have been, but

it went along? It was originally going to be very high
levels of security for the direct payment of Social
Security benefits through the system and then in the end
the DSS pulled out and
I certainly recall that the Benefits Agency pulled out
Anda deal was done with Fujitsu to carry on with just
the Post Office -
Yes

as a contracting party. If we look at the reason
that the Select Committee on Trade & Industry was
looking at it in July 1999, if we look halfway down the
page you will see

“Ata hearing of the Select Committee on Trade &
Industry in July 1999, two months after deciding to
cancel the swipe card, and causing massive monetary
loss, three cabinet ministers leaned heavily towards
blaming the supplier, ICL Pathway, for the disaster.”

Now, there was -- I think you have hinted at it,
that the relationships were not very easy, is that

a2

‘There were some very fascinating tensions going on, yes.
Yes. And there was some dispute over the terms on which
Fujitsu would carry on with a project that they had
anticipated and agreed would be both for two clients

essentially , with just one?

105

Yes.
And so the deal that was done with Fujitsu at that stage
‘was one which in some senses compensated Fujitsu for
losing the DSS?

I can’t comment on that. I didn’t know about the
contractual situation at that point

Now, in your paragraph 12 you say Fujitsu began a pilot
of the system in 1996 and it was rolled out across the
Post Office network between 1999 and 2000. Ar that
stage, the pilot was still for the Post Office and the
Benefits Agency, wasn't it?

I honestly don’t know. The objective of the original
Horizon system was very much to replace what was then
the mechanism for issuing pensions and such-like, which
was an order book, you would get 13 slips in it and

so my recollection is that this was what we were looking
to replace

And if we goto (F/3) please. That is the ICL Pathway
‘Technical Environment Description, do you see that?

Yes.

At that stage I think ICL -- Fujitsu hada majority
shareholding in ICL, but only became a 100% shareholder
in 1998, is that right?

I honestly don’t know.

You're not sure, no, If we look at page 9 of that

that there had been a number of problems with the old
legacy system that we have seen in many of the PEAKs.
HING-X was very much geared -- or HNG as it started
off -. was geared at refreshing the solution. I don't
remember it being seen as fixing a whole load of PEAKs,
it was simply seen as refreshing the system.

Yes, but pausing there, I -- my question is quite

specific .

Sorry.

Did you have any awareness of any problems that had been
encountered with Legacy Horizon by the time that you
were advising in relation to migration to

Horizon Online?

1 will have been aware of some at the time but

I honestly cannot remember any major issues that I was
dealing with, but because of the work I was doing,
because I was having to ensure that Post Office could
continue to deliver change and whatever, I would have
been aware of it, yes, certainly

Okay. So important PEAKs would have been drawn to your
attention under Legacy Horizon, you think?

I believe so, yes.

And when we look at the aims of the HNG-X plan, this is
dated 21 September 2005?

Yes.

109

Can we look at page 10 please {F/299/10}. This is
a document that you would have known about, isn’t it, in
all. likelihood?

I was certainly involved at this stage, yes.

And you will see that the
“While Post Office has considerably increased

under 1.4 you will se

expectations on cost reductions, the organisation has
also become substantially more open to operational
changes. Post Office has clearly indicated that
aspirations to a more retail -type IT spending are
matched with the acceptance of more retail -type
operational practices ”

And then:

“The original business case for HNG within
Post Office was based ona balance of cost reductions
and improved capabilities. The new business case is.
almost entirely based on cost reductions”,

Now, that was accurate at the time, wasn't it?
I didn’t write it, but I’m not going to argue the case.
And if we look at page 13, paragraph 3.1.1 (F/299/13} we
see under “Assumptions”:

“The fundamental assumes is that Post Office will
accept a solution based on the business capabilities
that the solution provides and will not insist on being
involved in the technical and technology aspects. This

will require Post Office to fully engage with suitable

empowered personnel in these initial stages and to have

in place assurance and decision-making processes that

align with the time/cost boxed programme milestones”
Now, just pausing there, effectively what is being

said is that Post Office was not insisting on being

involved in the technical and technology aspects, is

that correct?

Certainly it was looking for a more arm's length

relationship, sir, yes.

Amore .2

Arm’s length, 1 think.

Arm’s length?

Yes.

If we look at page 16 of this document please

(F/299/16}, do you see under 4.0 “Business

Applications ”

Mm-hm.

“In order to reduce the overall application development

costs within HING-X, substantial reuse of data centre

application components is proposed.”

Yes.

That's correct, isn’t it?

Yes.

That's what was proposed and what was done:

au

“The Legacy Host database applications (TPS, APS,
LFS, DRS and TES) are to remain largely intact ”

Can you remember what they were?
TPS is transaction processing system, AP is automatic
payment system, LFS is logistics feeder system or
service, DRSis data reconciliation service, TES is
transaction enquiry service.
‘Thank you. And they were remaining largely intact

“The online interfaces (~... Banking Streamline and
ETU)~.."

What was ETU?
ETUis electronic top-up. It's paying for your mobile
phone.

".. will be modified to provide a Web Service interface
in place of Riposte messaging together with

a simplification of the security mechanisms”

Yes.

That's a fair summary of the matters that it deals with
there?

Yes, 1 think so.

Now, that was recycling quite a lot of application
components, wasn’t it?

Yes.

And if we look at page 23 of this document {F/299/23}

you see in the second paragraph:

“There will be minimal change to legacy
applications. LFS, DRS and TPS will incorporate new
harvesters that will extract transactions from the
Branch database rather than the message store”

And that reflected the change that was going to be
made because the data would no longer be held in the
message store in branch, it would beheld in the branch
database, the BRDB?

That's right

“APS will be modified such that it extracts
transactional data directly from the TPS stream and this,
reduces the need for much of the AP-TP reconciliation .

Can you just tell the court what the AP-TP
reconciliation is?

AP is responsible for sending transactions off to
clients ; TP is responsible for sending transactions to
basically Post Office back-end systems. The
reconciliation was there to make sure that if you sent
something to the back -- to a client, it was also being
sent through to the Post Office back-end systems.
Okay. Then it says

“No other rationalisation is proposed to the data
centre applications as part of HING. A phase II
rationalisation programme is not deemed to be part of
the HING-X project and must be separately justified at

113

a later stage.”
What was phase I, do you know?

I don't think there ever has been a phase Il. We're

currently making changes which will probably get rid of

things like

and LES. TPSis still there, but pretty nearly

or certainly reengineer things like DRS

redundant, so nothing that I would recognise as

‘a phase II rationalisation process.

Okay. And if we look at (F/451} please, this is the
HING-X testing strategy. The documents dated

10 April 2008 and can we just go to page 10 please
{F/451/10}. Now, if you look at the third paragraph
down:

"It has been recognised for some time that this
architecture, whilst providing an extremely robust
operational solution, was not ideally suited to the very
different business and technology drivers that prevail
today”

Now, we see “robust” as a description of the
solution in lots of places in lots of documents, both at
PO and Fujitsu, and it’s a term that you're very
familiar with, isn’t it?

Yes.
‘The latter part of that sentence is saying it is not
ideally suited to the very different business and

technology drivers that prevail today and it goes on and
says:

“In addition, in common with many elderly systems
that have been subjected to a succession of major
changes, it has become increasingly difficult to make
those changes, and expensive to operate”

Now, that’s a fair description of how the system
originally was perhaps designed jointly with the DSS at
the beginning and launched and then over the years,
between then and 2008, there have been lots of sort of
bolt-ons and additional things that have been changed on
the system, haven't there?

Yes, I think that’s fair. The major one probably in my
mind would be banking.

And if we look at the fourth paragraph down, three lines
down please:

~The main drivers were to create a solution that was
more responsive to business change (faster time to
market), and more efficient to operate, maintain, and
enhance, thus providing lower Total Cost of Ownership
(TCO). However, HING was ambitious, projected costs were
high, and the benefit realisation profile was unclear.

In particular, HNG had been predicated on expecting
a high rate of future business change for the system.

Emerging business strategy in the Post Office indicated

115

that this was uncertain and could not be relied upon
sufficiently to support the proposed business case. As
a result HNG was suspended in the summer 2005.”

Yes? Can you remember that happening, the project
being suspended at that point?
Yes.
And if we now look at what is being proposed, the bottom
paragraph of section 1.1 on (F/451/10}:

~The HNG-X programme proposes a somewhat less.
ambitious re-engineering of Horizon, without the branch
network hardware refresh ..”
Yes.
*.. and with the focus squarely on reduction of the TCO
[total cost of ownership]. The principal drivers for
the HNG-X programme are to deliver a solution that
significantly reduces the TCO, whilst maintaining
"Business Equivalence’ (ie the HNG-X solution is to
provide effectively the same business capability as the
existing Horizon solution, but cost less to operate and
maintain)”

Now, is that a fair summary?
1 can’t argue with it, certainly

aimsare to:

give you all the information and skills that
you will need to successfully supporta branch from
Horizon to Horizon Online.”

So this is actually an internal Post Office
document, it appears, and if we look at page 10 please
{F/555/10}. This is Horizon’s current state

"13 year old design and technology to. satisfy
a different business.

“Slow and expensive to use.

“Evolved rather than designed - a consequence of
which is a robust service but complicated to change.”

Do yousee that?

Yes.

Now, the comment on it being a 13-year-old design and
technology is fair, isn’t it?

Yes.

‘The comment on it being slow and expensive to use is
fair, as at that date, or do you feel a bit conflicted
because you now work for Fujitsu?

1 know that Post Office regarded this as expensive and
they also regarded it as slow to change. I personally
didn’t necessarily go along with that because there was
a - there’s an AP-ADC product which since I was

involved in Post Office at this time, AP-ADC was my way

117

of being able to carry on making busines

changes whilst
we were going through this particular phase, so yes,

I feel slightly conflicted because I know that the

Post Office high-level vi

‘was that you couldn't make
changes to Horizon, whereas I was busy
do there were certainly changes you certainly could
not do, but my feeling was that we could continue to
support the business, they could continue to take on new
clients using this facility , AP-ADC.

Okay, well, havea look at the four lines at the bottom

you could

of the page if you would and see whether you think this
is fair

“Horizon is also a system that’s wrapped up in
“barbed wire’ -- making changes difficult and costly
test everything!”

Is that an understandable observation?
I think that I would see that from Post Office
perspective but, as I say, my personal view on this was
that I could still make changes by getting AP-ADC
seripts through, but there were certainly some things
that yes, if -- there were some things that would have
been very difficult to change at that time.
If welook at -- if we just go back if we may please to
{F/451} which is the HNG-X testing strategy of
10 April 2008. If welook at page 33 of that document

please (F/451/33}, paragraph 2.2.6, "Migration Complex
and Critical *

~The system and data migrations required for HNG-X,
both at the Data Centres, and at the branches (which
continues branch by branch throughout the roll -out
period), are absolutely fundamental to the success of
the deployment. It is a complex area requiring careful
and detailed planning. Thorough verification and
validation will be essential ”

Now, that’s fair, isn’t it? I mean, that’s what you
would expect to see, yes?
Yes.
And if we look at the bottom two paragraphs of that
section

"Migrated data should be introduced into the
mainstream tests as soon as practicable, interleaving
migration tests with functional test cycles”

And then:

“Full -blown rehearsals of the detailed migration
plans must be completed prior to Pilot

Yes?
Yes.
So what this envisages is that before the pilot is done,
there must be full blown rehearsals of detailed

migration plans to try and see if there are any problems

119

or difficulties
Yes.
Now, in fact, the pilot had to be stopped, didn’t it?
Do you remember that?
Yes.

"614 branches live on Horizon Online (plus 8 Model

Yes.
And then do you see:

“High Volume Pilot suspended”
Yes.
And:

“NESP raised concerns but remain supportive.”
Yes.
And can you remember that the NFSP had raised concerns
about the problems that people were having in the pilot?
No, I can’t, because at this stage -- this is early
2010
Post Office working ona different project and so this
was happening around me, but I was concentrating on
something which was called SMTS.
Okay, so you weren't in touch because you had only just
come back I think, hadn't you?
I had just come back into the Post Office to work on

No, sorry, I came back in January.

I came back to the Post Office in January to work on

small money transfer service.

Okay, at the bottom of that slide we see:

"Fujitsu initiated ‘red Alert’ and independent
reviews.”
Yes.

What did you
Fujitsu meantat the time?

I certainly would have done and when I moved across to
Fujitsu, we were in red alert.

So when you moved to Fujitsu they were in a state of red
alert on this project?

Yes.

did you know what a red alert from

And were there different codes for the colours of alert?
Were there other alerts, amber alert?

You have got me on that one, but I’m sure there were.
Can we infer from "red alert” that it is quite serious?
Oh, it was very serious

And can you tell_his Lordship why it was serious?

feet and trying to work on the big one.
Fair enough. Can we go back to {F/588} please. This is
the same PEAK I think I identified , PCO195380, and can
we go to page 4 of that PEAK please (F/588/4}. Now, can
you see in the box under 5 March 2010 at 08.03.08,
second box down?
Yes
Under -- it says:
“We have received notification from POL regarding
the problemsat this office. PSB ..”
Do you know who PSB was, or what it was?
No, I don’t think it’s a person. I don’t know what PSB
means.
Okay:
“On the Ist of March at the close of business we
found that on node the cash was short of £1,000. All
of the figures for that day match the figures presented
at the time of each transactions

It is possibly "Please see below” but ..

An instant saver
withdrawal of £1,000 was transacted that day, but I was
unable to find this transaction using the online report
facility
error has occurred at the time of this transaction.”

I feel very anxious as I believe a system

So this seems to be being relayed from what the SPM
has rung up about:
“On the 2nd of Marcha transaction for a cash

123

withdrawal was completed where the system commanded
a member of staff to issue the money to the customer on
screen but the receipt printed for that transaction
printed out a decline slip. The customer was honest
enough to bring back the decline receipt a day later
with the money”

Then:

“On the 2nd of March on node 5 a £220 cash deposit
was authorised on screen but twenty minutes later the
customer brought back receipt that stated the
We contacted the NBSC as and
when the customer produced the receipt. The NBSC stated
that the transaction approved on the system and had no

idea why the money was not deposited and why the decline
slip was printed.”

Now, pausing there, was this something that you
would have been aware of in March 2010 or not?
No, I wasin the Post Office at that time and so
I wasn't involved in this bit

2 A. Yes

3 Q. Did any of this come to your knowledge?

4 A. No.

5 Q. And if we see then:

6 “A rem was scanned in our system and all figures had

7 doubled up. The helpline team was notified at the time

8 to which they seemed more confused as to why it happened

9 than me!”

10 In your time prior to going off in 2009, had you
11 sort of encountered difficulties of this sort in other
12 PEAKs?
13. A. No, this is a problem with Horizon Online, so this is
14 a problem with the new system. I had at the time
15 that I finished my contract with Post Office, we were
16 gearing up for starting the migration process but the
17 big bit that concerned me most was the moving stuff
18 across from one data centre to another. This bit, the
19 counter migrations, was just kicking off in May 2010, so
20 okay, the figures there say that we had 600 branches,
21 I think you said there. So in May 2010 when I was back
22 on the scene but this time on the Fujitsu side, we were
23 in red alert, we did have a big problem with Oracle, we
24 were having to recover the situation so as to get ready
25 to carry on with the counter roll -out.

125

LQ. Nowif we look -- I apologise, I haven't got time to

2 take you to all of it, but there are quite a number of

3 apparent problems that they are wishing to raise, aren't

4 there?

5 A. I think this is the BT one, isn’t it? Does this one end

6 up with the branch transaction -- or the balancing

7 transaction, sorry? This looks to me as though the

8 dates are about right for the balancing transaction,

9 but -- yes, I think there were-- there certainly were
10 issues with the software in the early days of HING-X.
11 Q Yes. And that doesn’t come leaping out of your witness
12 statement, does it?

13. A. No.

14 Q. Andyou know thathis Lordship is trying to determine
15 how well the system worked over this period, don’t you?
16 A. Yes, that’s fair enough.

17 Q. Andis there a reason why there isn’t really any

18 reference to the problems with the system in your

19 witness statement?

20 A. I waslooking to give an overall explanation as to how
21 Horizon works. Obviously 1 was asked to pick up on
22 a number of specific problems that have been experienced
23 in the life of Horizon. There certainly were problems
24 to be dealt with in the early days of Horizon Online

{2/1/3}, but:

You mention those as well, yes?
Sorry, could you remind me where we are?

Sorry. If you look at paragraph 13 of your witness
statement, you talk about the migration to HNG-X--
Yes.
or Horizon Online, that's the same thing?
Yes.
And you say this

“This was the biggest overhaul in the Horizon
infrastructure that I can recall , although there have
been continuous and iterative updates to the system over
its life *

Now, pausing there, we have seen that quite a number
of the system components remained the same, didn't they,
from legacy days?
Yes.

Yes.

Now, isn’t HING-X, or Horizon Online, an end of life

version of the Horizon system rather than
a reinvigorated and rejuvenated version? Is that fair?
No. Horizon Online is the components that were
introduced by Horizon Online is the branch database, new
technology for communication between the branches and
data centres, so that was moving to an online system
which is a radical change to the
change to the architecture compared to Riposte and there
the communications technology change was pretty

dramatic in terms of moving from ISDN to what we have

it’s a radical

are -

now ~ or, sorry, to ADSL, whichis -- so it wasa big
overhaul

Can I pause there. The communications changes that you
mention are significant , aren't they, because there have
been quite a lot of communications problems with the
legacy version of Horizon?

Yes.

And

Sorry, the legacy version of Horizon was far more
susceptible to communication glitches.

Exactly. And so there were two improvements in that
respect: the susceptibility to communication glitches
was reduced, and also the quality of the communications
infrastructure was improved, is that fair?

Yes.

A. Indeed. The straight case is that the platform was

that was too old, but it continued to work surprisingly
well

A. Yes.

functional difference between the two: HNG-A refers to
an implementation of the same counter code as is used in
HNG-X to run ona Windows 10 device (whereas HNG-X

Yes? But there's not an explanation to anyone reading
this witmess statement of the sort of state of the

witness statement?

That's a fair point.

And in terms of the roll-out, did the first wave begin
in about February 2017, is that right?

For HNG-A?

Yes.

I can't really remember. The roll-out of HNG-A was not
really a Fujitsu problem.

Who was handling that?

icons on the touchscreen, keying in the transaction on

the keyboard, scanning a barcode, scanning a magnetic

card or some other manual interaction with the system.

These are referred to as “counter transactions “”
Yes?

Mm-hm.

‘Then transaction corrections, as you understand it:
*.. they are produced when Post Office compares the

data entered into Horizon by branches with data

generated from other sources in order to identify any

discrepancies.”

You say there “as I understand it”, that’s because
it’s not something that you knew that much about when
you were at Post Office?

1 know the general principles of it, but I certainly
wouldn't know the detail of how TCs are generated.
And it says:

“TCs are sent to the branch via Horizon”

And there is a footnote

“TCs are incepted in Post Office's POLSAP system
before being communicated to Horizon, via TPS to the
BRDB”

Was that something you knew yourself or something
somebody assisted you with?

Sorry, where are we now?

133

Footnote 2, explaining how they are generated.
I’monly seeing footnote 1

If we go over the page, sorry. {E2/1/5}.

I know that they come from POLSAP.

And how they are communicated via TPS to the BRDB, did
you pick that up from someone else or ..?

I could work that out for myself.

Did you, or did someone else tell you?

In this case 1 would have checked it, yes, so

With Gareth or ..2

No, this would be more a Pete Jobson one.

Okay. And you say “then accepted by a user in branch’.
You don’t know what's involved in that, do you?

I understand the principle because TCs were first
introduced in Impact, which I was involved with, and

I remember we had the conversations as to how TCs would
go into the branch and we were very clear that the
postmaster had to be aware, hence the mechanism that

I have seen described, which is they are presented with
the TC, they have to settle, they are given various
options on how to settle.

Yes. So why did
Yes.

you were involved in that design?

Why was there no dispute button?
That was a Post Office decision.

Can you remember what the pros and cons that they had in
mind were when they made the decision?

1 think the basic argument was that disputes -- we
wanted the flow of data through the system as quickly as
possible because that keeps our books tidy and it was an
inference that there was always the -- you had to press
a button to take things through, but then you would pick

up the phone to NBSC and say that wasn’t right

MR JUSTICE FRASER: Were you involved in the discussion

about that, or were you just told there wasn't going to
bea dispute button?

1 would say that I was aware. I wasn’t particularly
engaged in the conversation. I regarded that as
business processing, my Lord. There is a precedent to
this which is technically very similar, which is
auto-rems, which I wasalso involved in, where the whole
process changed so to save the subpostmaster having to
key in the amounts in each pouch, they were presented
with a screen which said “The amounts coming in are

this, press this button.” I would like to remember, but
I can’t be certain, that at that point there was

a message to say "If you disagree, phone up the help
desk", but again the principle was there to say “This is
the right figure, accept it and then argue the case

outside”

135

‘Then we look at "Equipment located in a branch other

than a Horizon terminal.” You say it

"... is required for some transactions, such as
a Camelot terminal for lottery products and a Paystation
terminal for some bill payments”

And the point you make there is that these bits of
‘equipment communicate information direct to a client or
other supplier, who relays that information to
Post Office, or Fujitsu on Post Office's behalf, who
then senda transaction acknowledgement to the branch
via Horizon.

So can we just pause there. Can we trace how
a piece of information gets froma scratchcard
activation into the various repositories of information,
so tracing it through in accordance with what you have
said there, there’s a piece of equipment, namely the
lottery terminal, and the SPM activates some cards on
the lottery terminal, yes?

Yes.

‘That information is then relayed directly to Camelot,

the client?

Yes.

And Camelot then in turn relay that to the Post Office ,
or Fujitsu on the Post Office's behalf, just following
your witness statement.

MR GREEN: That's my fault.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: Do you want to just clear it up?

MR GREEN: Yes. So the journey that immediately is seen by

No, that’s fine. Thank you.

It’s at that point that they enter the branch accounts?
Yes.

And that is the data that is then captured by the audit
system?

Yes.

And that’s true -- with minor differences but
substantially correct -- for the other items of
equipment that you have in mind in paragraph (c)?

Yes, the difference is that the Paystation data comes
from Ingenico to us. Weload it into the branch
database in separate tables and we generate the TA, but
then you are onto a common stream.

And then again, that is the data that then goes into the
audit store?

Yes, it’s the action at the counter which then contains
data which comes up into the branch database and that is
the bit that goes into the audit store

Whatis the action that you are talking about there at
the counter?

Pressing the “Accept” button

On the TA?

Yes.

And then at (d) you say:

139

“In Horizon Online it

is possible for Fujitsu to
insert a balancing transaction - see paragraph 58
below.”
Yes.
We will come back to that later. We have already dealt
with it, at least in part. Just focusing on (a), (b)
and (c) for a moment, when we look at the data that
‘we're concerned about in paragraph 17.2(a), you point
out, quite rightly, that:

“The vast majority of transactions are manually
entered by a user in branch at the counter ..”

And then importantly *.. by pressing icons on the

Yes.
So the significance of that is that the transaction data
comprises the fact of a press -- one press by an SPM on
a particular icon, yes, andthe significance of that in
the reference data table being put together so that
something pops up in the basket, as I mentioned to

arrangements between Escher and Fujitsu were if there
were problems with Riposte?

A. I certainly don’t know. I’m obviously conscious, having
looked at PEAKs, that there were issues, but I was not
aware of those at the time.

Q. I understand. You deal with Horizon Online from
paragraph 20 (E2/1/6} in relation to the accuracy of

Is it fair to say this is more within

your own knowledge, this bit of your statement?

I feel that 1 know this pretty well, yes.

So back on home turf in a sense?

transaction data.

In that sense, yes.
And in paragraph 26 (E2/1/7} you mention the controls

oPror

that were in place. Do you know whether those controls

ever failed? Take the first one, “A basket must balance
to zero”

A. We have checked this. If you do something ona test
system to cause a basket not to balance to zero, it
shows an error.

Q. And you mentioned the Journal Sequence Number. It’s
impossible, isn’t it, for the database to accept two
items with the same JSN number?

A. Correct.

Q. Can we look please at {F/590/7}. Just t0 orientate you
in this, perhaps we can goto the first page, I’m sorry

(F/590}. You will see that this is PEAK PCO195561. Do
you see that?
Yes.
And if we go to page 7 {F/590/7} and we look at
24 March 2010 at 14.45.49, which is the middle one, do
you see there:

“Time-outs were the underlying cause of the issue
and that there were long delays waiting on the DB ..”

That’s the database, yes?

to process the 4 requests.”

Mm-bhm.
“In this case two of the requests were committed and two
correctly detected that the transaction had already
succeeded. There is an issue with the 2 commits because
this shouldn't have happened. However the behaviour of
the OSR from CTR 25.07 onwards is to roll the
transaction back ona time-out. In this scenario all
the requests would have failed and no reconciliation is
required.

“We would like to find the root cause of the issue
as to how the duplicate entry was committed in the DB”

Now, I know you were working on other things
in March 2010, but were you aware of any problems with
items with a duplicate JSN number, Journal Sequence

Number, being committed to the database?

147

I'mnotsure this is saying we had duplicate JSNs, but
I would obviously have to check the detail and no,
1 wasn’t aware.
You weren't aware of that problem generally?
No.
Okay. And you were here! think for Mr Dunks’ evidence
this morning.
Mm-hm.
Paragraph 32 of your witness statement (E2/1/10} says:
“I am not aware of any instances where data
retrieved from the audit store differs from other
sources of data, nor am aware of any instances where
the integrity checks described in paragraph 30 have
revealed any issues.”
Yes?
Yes.
Were you aware that there had been duplication of data
identified in Seema Misra’s case?
Misra I believe was on the old system,
Yes, legacy.
Yes. So no, I was not aware of that
In terms of ARQ figures, can we look at paragraph 31 of
your witness statement please {E2/1/10}. You say there:

Team) that the number of ARQs issued since the 2014/15
financial year is as follows

And you then say one ARQ equals one month ofan
individual branch data so one Post Office request for
data could have multiple ARQs, yes?

A. Yes.

Q. Just to explain what the figures are. And you have
a footnote to that which says:

"These figures do not include the ARQs that Fujitsu
has issued in relation to these proceedings.”

So is it actually -. where did you get that
information from?

A. From Jason.

Q. So what did you ask him?

‘A. Personally I didn’t ask him anything, This was
information that was being requested to go into the
witness statement, so I'm confident that it is correct
I have no particular motive in providing that
information.

Q. I’mjust trying to -- I’mnot talking about motive, I’m
just trying to identify how it has ended up in your
witness statement.

A. I was effectively asked to put it in.

Q. So did Jason Muir actually inform you of this in

response to any requests from you?

149

AL No.
Q. Because that saves me asking the next question which was
why didn't you ask him for earlier years.

Now, can we just look at the years that we've got
there, 31.1 to 31.4, When you were shown the
information that you were to put into your witness
statement you must have noticed that it only went from
the 14/15 year to the 17/18 year.

A. I didn’t pay it any particular attention

Q. Bur you have been dealing with Legacy Horizon which
pre-dates 2010

A. That's true

Q. - in the same witness statement, so you must have had
in mind what the chronological sweep of this witness
statement was supposed to deal with, mustn't you?

A. ['mafraid I didn’t do my job in that case.

MR GREEN: Can we move now to

‘MR JUSTICE FRASER: Just before you move off that, can you
think of any reason why there should be a cut off at the
beginning of 2014, in terms of the system, or the way it
worked, or anything?

A. I can’t think of any reason why that information would
not be available further back.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: Mr Green.

now. Can we look please at (F/1692}
bea Fujitsu document. We see at the bottom "Fujitsu
restricted" and “Copyright Fujitsu Limited 2017. The
title of the document is "Post Office Account - Customer

This appears to

service problem management procedure” and can we please
go -- if younote the “abstract” there:

“To describe and document the customer service
problem management process.”

Now, you are the chief architect, aren't you, in
relation to the responsibility for changes being made to
the system being implemented without prejudicing the
continued operation of the system? That's what you say
in your witness statement?

Yes, that’s right.

And this is a recent document which relates specifically
to the Post Office account. Is this a document you have
seen before?

1 can’t honestly say. It’s certainly not one that I'm
particularly familiar with,

Okay. Let’s havea look, if we may please, at page 8
(F/1692/8}. You will see just under 1.1 "Process
objective and scope”:

“The objective of this documentis to define the
process for problem management in the POA environment to

support the contracted infrastructure and application

151

services described in the HNG-Xcontract. Other
infrastructure and services used by POA to provide and
support delivery of the HNG-Xcontract are also in scope
of the process.”

Now, just pausing there for a second, POA js the
Post Office account team at Fujitsu, isn’t it?

Correet.
Then it says:

“For the purpose of this documenta problem is
defined as the unknown underlying root cause of one or
more incidents”

Yes?

Yes.

“The problem management process covers both reactive and
proactive functions of problem management”

Yes.

Now, if one is to havea robust system it’s important,
isn’t it, to make informed assessments of where problems
lie based on the relevant information that was
available?

Yes

And it’s important to capture and track that in a way
that can readily be analysed, is that fair?

Yes.

And that seems to be at least consistent, if not the aim

of this procedure, yes?
Agreed, yes
Let's look please at the document history on page 4
please {F/1692/4}. Wecan see that the draft document
was updated in 2007 and we can see various changes going
in and out and various revisions going forward on that
basis. If we go over the page {F/1692/5}, we can see up
to a date in September 2017, yes?
Yes.
Now, can I just give you the context in which this
document has come to the fore, so that you can see it
clearly. The two experts both comment onit. If we go
please to {D2/1/96}, this is MrCoyne’s report. We get
to paragraph 5.156 there and it is clear from that
paragraph that Mr Coyne was working on the basis that
the problem management procedure had actually been acted
upon and you can see there, at 5.156, he says

“The Post Office account customer service problem
management procedure document ..”

Which he footnotes:

identifies the process metrics and key

performance indicators required for measuring the
effectiveness of the process and service specifically in
relation to problem management. The problem management

procedure is set out in more detail at appendix E ...

153

relevant to this section and issue 6 are the metrics and
KPIs to measure/control and reduce the risk of failure
to detect, correct and remedy Horizon errors and bugs.”

Yes?

Now, if we go please to page 97 over the page
{D2/1/97} and we look at 5.157, he says:

“From the above, it is my opinion that Post Office
should be aware of all recorded bugs/errors/defects in
addition to those previously acknowledged by them, from
the process metries compiled above.”

So what Mr Coyne seems to have inferred is that the
problem management process had been implemented and
there would be feedback from Fujitsu to Post Office
about what errors and bugs -- that seems to be the basis
he is proceeding on, doesn't it, onthe face of it?

On the face of it, certainly.

And if we go now to {D3/7/81} we can see Dr Worden

this is his second report and he appears to be working
on the basis also that the problem management procedure
had been brought in. If we look at the third column he
says -- so it is row 21, it relates to 5.156, which is

Mr Coyne'’s paragraph I just showed you, the extract of
Mr Coyne’s paragraph is there, and then if you look on
the right-hand side under “Commentary” you will see:

“This document isa rather high level and generic

description of the problem management process.

“It is difficult to extract a clear picture from
this document of how the process works in practice
For instance, there are listed about 20 types of process
input and 20 types of process output,
discern from these long lists which inputs and outputs
‘were most important.

It is hard to

“As another indication of its generic nature, the
words "bug’, “defect ’, ‘software’ and ‘reference da

a
never occur in the document. The word ‘error’ does
occur. Errors are discussed generically not as specific
types of error such as errors in Horizon”

So both experts appear to be approaching it on the
basis that it had been acted upon.

Now, if we look at (F/1692/10}, going back to the
problem management document at page 10, we can see what
the relevant metries are. Now, those are competent
professional metries that you would expect to see in
a policy of this sort, aren’t they?

Yes.
You can see that what's proposed there is

“The following metrics, to be reported monthly, will
be used to measure effectiveness of the process and
drive performance of the process and overall service in

general.”

155

‘That’s the way it is going to work?
Yes.

‘And were you aware, as you are one of the key people at
Fujitsu, that Mr Coyne had asked for documents to be
provided which he thought should exist based on the
problem management procedure? Did you know ~ did that
come to your attention at all?

It has not come to my attention.

Well, I will take it quite quickly. Let's havea look
at (D2/5/22}. This is a request for information and

a response and you can see that in relation to this

in the Post Office response to requests for information,
if we go down to page 26 (D2/5/26} you will see in the
left -hand column at the bottom:

“Please provide how many times (and over what
period) the ‘problem management process’ has recorded
the potential for a system or software error?”

And then in the column with Post Office ’s response:

"Post Office objects to this request. Fujitsw
believes that it does not record problems in such a way
that would allow this to be determined without
retrospectively carrying out detailed analyses.”

Andso forth. Over the page:

“This would require a disproportionate effort and
cost.”

You have addressed this issue at paragraph 63 of
your witness statement at {E2/7/16}, haven't you?
A. T have.
Q. And what you have explained there
witness statement this is. What you say there is
“I have spoken to my colleague Steve Bansal,
Fujitsu's senior service delivery manager, who has

in your second

informed me that the Post Office account customer
service problem management procedure document was
introduced by Saheed Salawu, Fujitsu's former Horizon
lead service delivery manager and that Saheed Salawu
left the Fujitsu Post Office account in
around February 2013, before the new procedure had been
implemented. I understand from Steve that
Saheed Salawu's replacement did not wish to implement
the changes and therefore the records referred to by
Mr Coyne in paragraphs 5.157 to 5.159 of his report do
not exist, as we continued to follow the previous
existing reporting methodology”
Now, can we just unpack that slowly. Who was
Saheed Salawu's replacement?
A. I don't know. As youcan tell I’ma bit vague on this
area, I remember Saheed, I don’t know whether it was
‘Tony Wicks who took over from him or somebody else.

Q. Because when we go back to the document itself, at

157

{F/1692/4], here is the "Summary of changes and reason

for issue”, The document's history goes back to 2007,
doesn't it?

AL Yes.

Q. And it looks like it wasissued for approval in 2014,
doesn't it?

‘A. Well, it was issued for approval on 9 December 2013,
yes.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: “Issued for approval” appears in
a number of places I think

A. Yes and the convention is that when you goto a "0"
version then that’s one that is being issued for
approval.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: Hence 2.0, April 2008;

3.0, December 2013; 4.0, July 2014?

A. Yes

‘MR JUSTICE FRASER: And that's why they are all "0" because
they are all issued for approval?

‘A. They should all be issued for approval, yes.

MR GREEN: And thatis after the date when you say Mr Salawu
left .

A. I think so because! think Saheed left in 2013, so it
looks as though it was Tony Wicks who came in to take
on -- take up from him,

Q. So can you explain to his Lordship what the procedure

for adopting a policy or procedure of this sort is?

It’s governance within the account
team, I am certainly no expert on that aspect of it.

Q. Okay, because when we go over the page {F/1692/5} in
2017 we see no comments from review cycle. It is still
being dealt with in 2017 and we can see the name of
‘Tony Wicks for review comments, can't we?

A. I'mafraid not.

>

Yes

Q. Requested by 14 December 2017. Is he the person we
would really have to ask about this?

‘A. If my suppositions are correct then it looks as though
Tony Wicks is the man who has driven this.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: He is the what, sorry?

‘A. He would be the man who has driven this

MR GREEN: And he is the person we would really have to ask
about what happened after February 2013?

A. Yes, if my suppositions are right that he took over from
Saheed

MR JUSTICE FRASER: Well, would you like to look at page 1
{F/1692}. What does "Approval authorities” mean?

A. Approval -- sorry, that would be Steve Bansal who would
sign it off

MR GREEN: Let's look at the Legacy Horizon reporting system

because in your paragraph 63-- if wecan just go back

to that (E2/7/16} - you say there in the last line of

159

that:
we continued to follow the previous existing

reporting methodology.”

Is that a reporting methodology with which you're
familiar?
No.
So that’s whathe -- you've got all of that from Steve?
I got -- basically I got this from Steve.
And you don't really know what the reporting methodology
is?

oPpoPr

A. Notin any detail at all.

Q. Doyou imagine it ought to be documentary, or would it
be oral, or ..2

A. I imagine it happening via the service review meetings
that Steve chairs. We have regular sessions with ATOS,

with other suppliers, but I have not -- I can’t remember

actually going to one. I’maware that there are
meetings with Post Office and ATOS to talk about service
issues.

Q. Okay. Let’s look in paragraph 64 where you are dealing
with the service review book. You say:

“When Legacy Horizon was in place problem management

was reported in a specific section within the service
review book (SRB).”

Is that something you also got from Steve or

Q,
A

something that you knew about yourself?

No, that is from Steve. I have probably seen service
review book outputs in the past but

That was a fairly high level review of problem
management and (inaudible) main problems, was it?
Very high level, yes.

If we look please at your paragraph 65 (E2/7/16}, is
this still Steve Bansal?

Yes.

So how far down does that go? Is this all -- just give
usa feel for how far down we go.

I think to the bottom of the page.

To the bottom of the page, I see.

In paragraph 65 you say that:

“From September 2010 these SRBs reported metrics
only against contractual service level agreements
ands there are no contractual SLAs for problem
management, itis not covered in the SRB reports
between ... 2010 and 2014”

That's right, is it? That's what you understand
from Steve?

That's certainly what! understand from Steve.
Okay. I mean wouldn't Post Office want to know the sort
of information that would be conveyed from that sort of

reporting procedure?

161

1 would imagine so and I did not attend the meetings
with Post Office and ATOSso
There's only so far wecan take it?
Yes.
And you say at paragraph 66 (E2/7/16} -- and
I appreciate this is also from Steve Bansal:
“For the years 2014 to 2017 there are annual problem
review reports
Yes?

Yes.
Is that system still in place in 2018?
I just do not know.

‘MR JUSTICE FRASER: I'm having grave difficulty with

following this at what might be called face value, which
is why I'm just interrupting. Is the import or the
summary of your paragraph 63 to 66 that these types of
metrics are only available between the years you have
identified in those paragraphs and that Fujitsu doesn’t
keep them, or hasn't kept them for years outside the
ones identified in those paragraphs?

1 don’t know the answer to that, my Lord. I don’t know
whether there were records available, I would have to
speak in far more detail to Steve and others to

ascertain that

Steve about this?

A. I waslooking for a high level response ona specific
issue that was being requested.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: And what specific issue was that?

‘A. I think it was raised by Mr Coyne.

MR JUSTICE FRASER: Insofar as you can remember, do you
remember what it was?

‘A. It was simply looking for -- my recollection of it was
that he was concerned that Saheed had suggested an
improvement to problem management and was looking for
the evidence that that had been implemented and when
1 spoke to Steve and said "Did we implement this?” he
said no.

MRJUSTICE FRASER: All right. Mr Green.

MR GREEN: If we look at [F/1420}, this is headed "2014 POA
problem management - problem review”, do you see that?

A. I do.

Q. It is called version 1.0, at the bottom right-hand side,
which suggests it has been issued for approval and we

see "Document statu:
AL Yes

Q. Again Mr Bansal’s name under "Approval authorities”.

Y approval’.

Was this one actually implemented, or do you not know?
A. I don't know.
Q. Have a quick look at page 6 {F/1420/6}. I'm going to

163

have to take this quite quickly, Mr Godeseth, because
it’s obviously not something you're familiar with, but
this appears to contemplate undertaking a trend analysis
and so forth to review the knowledge database, review
problems and so forth, and if we goto page 7
(F/1420/7}, on the face of it looks as if there are
considerations, for example, of specific problems that
have in fact occurred. Do you see that?

AL Yes.

Q. So onthe face of it it does look from this document as
if there is a problem management review document with
some actual problems in it, although it seems to be
issued for approval. Is this something you know
anything about?

A. No.

Q. Just quickly then, very briefly, if you look at page 13
please (F/1420/13). If welook in the middle stripe,
41939577. Do yout see that?

AL Yes.

Q. It mentions First Rate. Who are First Rate?

A. First Rate Exchange Services are, I believe, a joint
venture owned by Post Office and Bank of Ireland, but
they provide foreign -- they provide bureau services.

Q. And they say:

“First Rate has identified an anomaly over the way

Is this something that came to your attention at
all?
No.
Because it does seem to have been fixed in counter
release for R9.
Yes
Release 9?
I don't remember what date release 9 was. It would have
been on my watch, but
It’s not something you remember particularly?
No.
And you don’t remember having seen this document either?
No.
If we look at (F/1497}, this one is the "2015 POA
problem management - problem review” and if we look at
page 7 there (F/1497/7}, do you recognise this one at
all or not?
I think I do from the recent review, but I couldn't be
certain without checking it in more detail
Because it is in the same formatas the previous one,
isn’t it?
Yes.
And in the bottom stripe we see 410821106:

165

“Transaction discrepancies can occur during the
rem-in process especially when transferring cash from
one branch to another (eg between their main branch to
their outreach branch ).”

Can we go back up very kindly. And then under
“Description”:

“The underlying cause of this problemis that
a logout before a user has fully logged on, then
subsequently a pouch is rem-in manually, then after the
rem-in slip has been printed, the same screen is
redisplayed and if the user press enter again,

a duplicate will occur. A code fix has been developed
and is in release 12.88 hot fix.”
Does that ring any bells?
That sounds like Dalmellington is it Dalmellington?

Yes, it is the Dalmellington bug, isn’t it?
And it doesn’t capture how many branches were
affected, does it, that report?
That's true.
It doesn’t capture how long it took to find?
No.
It doesn't capture the financial amounts involved?
No.
So is it fair to say that that report is not
a particularly rigorous or robust treatment of recording

the problem, its extent and duration and effect?
I think that’s a fair comment.
Can we turn now please to understand a little bit better
the issues around balancing transactions that we touched
on earlier and can we first look please at {F/1692).
This is another Tony Wicks Post Office account customer
service problem management procedure document. Now ~
we will perhaps come back to that

Let me take you forward, if I may ~ or back in the
bundle to (F/425} and just show you this to get the
chronology. If yousee at the top, the title onthe top
is, "Host BRDB transaction correction tool low level
design.” Do yousee that?
Yes.
And this is the low level design document, isn’t it, for
the branch database transaction correction tool?
Yes.
And it says “Document status: draft” and the “Approval
authorities” is Graham Allen. Do you know Graham Allen?
I do.
Do you work with him?
Yes.
And the author and department it says Rajesh Shastri.
Do you work with him?

I don't recognise his name.

167

And if we just go forward to page § (F/425/5} we can see
that the document history shows the draft version being
produced in October 2007 and then, 29 September 2009,
“Add transaction correction journal auditing” Do you
know what transaction correction journal auditing is?
Sorry, where are we?

Sorry, bottom of the 0.2 table.

29 September 2009, yes.

Now, this was a tool that was being developed for
Horizon Online, wasn’t it?

Yes.

And if we go to page 8 (F/425/8}, under "Overview" it
explains that:

“This document provides the low level design for the
branch database transaction correction tool module. The
utility will allow SSC to correct transactions by:
inserting balancing records to
transactional /accounting/stock tables in the BRDB
system. It will also audit the changes made. There
will be no updating/deleting of records in the branch
database”

And then it says:

"Warning: the use of this powerful tool has inherent
risks. If the SQL statement is incorrect or badly
written, it is possible to cause unintended

period: 2,297 (H/218/2),

Now, just to give you the context of what's being
said, if you go back a page what's said in the middle of
that letter there is:

“Fujitsu have extracted the data from 2010 to 2019
and provided the following explanation for the
documents. It should be noted that Relativity is not
able to recognise OKB documents since these do not
contain any data and therefore disclosure can only be
provided of the 2,297 files which contain data. We
understand from Fujitsu that a OKB file is produced
where there was no logged activity . A disclosure list
is enclosed”

So that’s the explanation for the difference between
46,976 and 1, yes?

Yes.
‘And when we go over the page please (H/218/2), it says:

“Each document is associated with a single SQL
statement which made a database correction. There are
two different types of correction shown in the
files - the SQL statements for each are of the form:

“1. Update OPSSBRDB.brdb_rx_recovery_transactions
SET settlement_complete_time stamp = ..”
And then the “INSERT INTO” command.

It says

175

“Type 1 reflects the action taken to reset the
recovery flag on a transaction. This will have no
effect on branch accounts (see footnote 58 in our letter
of response ...)”

Which says:

“Several hundred other balancing transactions have
been used but not in a manner that would affect branch
accounting. These were generally used to ‘unlock’
a stock unit within a branch”

Do you see that?
Yes.
Were you asked about the explanations that are being
given here, or would it be someone else at Fujitsu who
would know about this?
‘This would have been written by others but I’m fully
aware of

And then it says:

“Type 2 reflects the action taken to insert
a Balancing Transaction.”

It has a big "B" anda big
“Transaction”:

‘Balancing

where it changes transaction data in the main
transactional tables. This will affect branch
accounts.”

‘Yes?

1 an accounting or operational error would typically be

3 A balancing transaction can add a transaction to the
4 branch's accounts but it cannot edit or delete other
5 data in those accounts. Balancing transactions only
6 exist within Horizon Online .... and so have only been in
7 use since around 2010. Their use is logged within the
8 system and is extremely rare. As far as Post Office is
9 currently aware a balancing transaction has only been
10 used once to correct a single branch's accounts (not
1. being a branch operated by one of the claimants ).”
12 Then 5.16.4:
13 "Database and server access and edit permission is
14 provided, within strict controls ... to a small,
15 controlled number of specialist Fujitsu

Now, just focusing on your time at Post Office,
1 think at this time you're not really working on.
Horizon any more, are you?
Correct.
Did you hear on the grapevine of anyone at Post Office
being asked for authorisation for this sort of thing to
be done?
No.
Once you arrived at Fujitsu did you have any involvement
in seeking approval, or discussions with Gareth Jenkins
about anything like this being done?
No.
Did you know that Post Office 's approval had been sought
for this particular transaction?
No,
If we go forward please to page 9 (F/590/9},
22 April 2010:

“I have gone through the counter logs, OSR logs and
the DB dumps provided in the PEAK. Let’s analyse this
from serateh *

Pausing here, you have acknowledged under legacy

183

there were sometimes problems with duplications within
the Riposte system, yes?

Yes.

But we're not dealing with that system here, we're
dealing with Horizon Online, aren't we?

Yes. If it mentions OSR, certainly.

Okay. The second paragraph of that says:

“PEAK has heen raised when a clerk attempted to
transfer out of 4,000.00 from stock unit BBto MS. Due
to a system problem the transfer out doubled up, so when
the transfer in was done on counter 1 at 16.15, it was
for 8,000.00. The branch now has alot of (£4,000]"

Do you see that?

Yes.
And there’s then some discussion and then if we come
down to:

“But, I have noticed that the retried request (with

check whether duplicate JSN entries exists in the table.
But from the DB dump I couldn't find any duplicates ”

Now, the whole point of JSN entries is that they
should not duplicate and if they are duplicates they
should not be committed to the database; that’s right,
isn't it?

Yes. AndI think you will see there that the retried
requests failed because there was already a journal
record in the database with that JSN.

Well, let's just follow this through, if we may. If we
look now please at (F/594}, you will see that this is
PEAK 0195962. Do yousee that? This is Cheryl Card
again,

Yes.

And if we just go down to the yellow bar it says:

“The transaction correction tool has now been used
in live. The templates for use with this tool need to
be updated to correct some details”

Yes?

Yes.

So the idea was to have templates so that the scripts
wouldn't have too many errors in them when they were
deployed.

Yes.

And that PEAK refers in turn, we can see -- if we look

185

at (F/1095} please. Wecan see this is the OCP 25882
Can you just tell his Lordship what an OCP is?
Operational Change Process I believe

And there's also an OCR, isn’t there?

Yes, that is Operational Change Request, as I understand
it

And one is for the change to the front end and one is to
change the back-end. The OCPis for the front end and
the OCRis

1 don't know.

You don’t know. If welook at this document at
{F/1095}, the branch 226542 transfer out doubled up. We
can see:

“Due to a system fault, the branch did
a transfer out of £4,000 and a corresponding transfer in
of £8,000.

” Justification : correct a loss of £4,000 at the
branch due to a system fault
transfer in details were incorrectly doubled up when
they were written to the BRDB. This needs to be
corrected using the transaction correction tool ”

Do you see that?

Yes.

extra detail: the

Now, on the face of it this appears to be consistent
with at least one use of the transaction correction tool

for one balancing transaction, yes?
Yes.
And are you aware of any reason why Post Office couldn't
have just used a transaction correction for £4,000 to
correct the SPM’s position?
If we-- the only reason that we would need to use the
branch transaction tool is if I got a one-sided
transaction
If you got a one-sided transaction?
Yes.
Let’s look, if we may please, at (F/485/1). This is
PEAK PCO175821. Do you see that?
Yes.
And the call status onthe right is “Closed - solicited
known error” Do you know when that code is used or
now?
No.
If you look down on 19 February 2009 at 17.39.40, can
you see:

“There are two sides to the problem relating to
these transactions. The first is where all five SC
transactions mi

ing core data as described in the
above-mentioned KEL”

Yes

That's one aspect of the problem in this PEAK:

187

“Second is absence of equal but opposite
(ie settlement) lines. See PCO152014 for a similar
problem and how problem was resolved.”
Yes.
“For the first problem, I have used the TRT to insert
the missing data ie Region, Margin, Margin Product and
EffectiveExRate ”

Now, pausing there, what does it look to you is
going on here?
It looks to meas though we are inserting into a totally
different database because it is TMS_RX so this is
the -- this is not the branch database.
No. Andalso they seem to be using the transaction
repair tool
Yes
Rather than the transaction correction tool
Which I think would be what I have referred to as the
TIP(2) repair tool.
Yes?
And TMSis -- yes, it's not part of the BRDB.
But what we do see -- and this is in February 2009, so
this is Horizon Online, isn’t it?
It could be .. 2009 was migration, so I don’t for
certain know without looking further at whether this was
old or new.
