I, Angela Van Den Bogerd, will say as follows:



 1    I make this statement in response to a Request for Information pursuant to

      Rule 9 of the Inquiry Rules 2006, regarding matters within Phases 5 and 6 of

      the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry, dated 29 January 2024.



 2.   As laid out below, I was closely involved with the Sub-Postmasters ("SPM")

      claims, including acting as a witness in the Common Issues Trial and Horizon

      Issues Trial. I have followed the Inquiry and what has come out of it has

      horrified me. Had I known that the Horizon IT system was flawed on

      implementation, my approach would have been different throughout my time

      with Post Office Limited ("POL"). I am in complete support of full

      compensation for all SPM's who were affected by Horizon IT issues and

                                                                                       WITNO9900100




     regret that it has not been paid out quicker and to an appropriate value which

     meets their claims.



3.   1 have set out to answer the Inquiry's questions to the best of my ability but I

     have at times been limited in my ability to do so due to issues with disclosure.

     Where I have knowledge that documents are in existence but have not been

     disclosed, I have requested these both direct from POL and the Inquiry and

     unfortunately some have been disclosed at the last minute or not at all. My

     intention is to assist the Inquiry in a full and frank way which provides them

     with meaningful answers, but I have felt impeded in my ability to do so and so

     I feel it necessary to highlight these difficulties that I have experienced. In

     addition to the Rule 9 documents disclosed by the Inquiry, I requested and

     received over 300 additional documents, numbering over 4,500 pages.



 4. During my time with POL I have always acted to the best of my ability and

     with the knowledge I had at the time, I was always reassured that Horizon

     was robust and that underlined the basis of my actions. I regret that it took so

     long for the true position on Horizon integrity and remote access to be

     acknowledged and the impact that this has had.



 5. To those that were wrongly prosecuted, whilst I wasn't personally involved in

     those prosecutions, I am truly sorry for the devastating impact that has had on

     them and their family and friends.



6.   1 have heard the term 'corporate amnesia' being referenced about some

     evidence already given to the Inquiry. I want to say from the outset that my

                                                                                     WITNO9900100




     intention is to fully cooperate with the Inquiry and help Sir Wyn Williams in his

     investigation. I will not try to hide anything and say that I cannot remember

     something when i can. In putting together this witness statement I have

     reviewed everything disclosed to me by the Inquiry and, as noted above, I

     also requested and reviewed over 300 additional documents to help me

     provide as full an answer as possible. If I am unable to recall a detail, i will do

     my best to direct the Inquiry to where they can obtain that information. I hope

     that my witness statement goes some way to assisting the SPM's with

     obtaining the truth.




7.   1 can confirm that I have had the legal assistance of Ashfords LLP in drafting

     this statement.




8.   1 left school in 1984 with 11 0 Levels and 2 A Levels. Whilst studying for my A

     Levels, I worked part-time as a retail assistant and as a lifeguard. I joined POL

     in 1985 at the age of 19.




9.   The Inquiry have been unable to locate a record of my employment from POL,

     but from memory, the roles I held whilst employed by POL are as follows:




        a. 1st April 1985: I joined the Post Office as a Post Office Counter

            Assistant within the directly managed network of post offices in the

            Swansea area.

                                                                             WITNO9900100

     and reach of the Post Office network, including determining whether

     branches in new locations should be opened.


i.   September 2012 ® August 2013: I was Head of Partnerships. I was

     responsible for the relationship between Post Office and the

     recognised representative bodies: the Communication Workers Union,

     Unite the Union and the National Federation of Subpostmasters.


j.   August 2013 — March 2015: I was Programme Director for the Branch

     Support Programme. I was responsible for reviewing the existing level

     of support that the Post Office provided to branch operators, identifying

            gaps and making recommendationslintroducing improvements to close

            those gaps.


       k. April 2015 — December 2016: was Director of Support Services

            where I was responsible for the Post Office helpline for

            Subpostmasters (NBSC), the customer helpline, the Financial Service

            Centre (FSC), the Human Resources Service Centre (HRSC), and also

            managing the Contract Advisors and Contract Administration teams.


       I.   January 2017 — January 2018: I was the People and Change Director,

            responsible for HRSC, Health and Safety and the Change Portfolio

            (business transformational projects) across the organisation.


       m. January 2018 — July 2018: was People Services Director responsible

            for HR services within the Finance and Operations business unit,

            Health, Safety & Well-being and the HR Service Centre.


       n. August 2018 — May 2020: I was Business Improvement Director and I

            worked closely with Counsel and Legal Advisors, to assist in preparing

            the Post Office case to defend a Group Litigation brought against it

            (Bates v Post Office (No 3) [2019] EWHC 606 (QB)) whilst

            simultaneously making improvements to the franchise support model.




10. In addition to my roles detailed above, from 2012 onwards, I was a member of

    the Working Group, the Initial Complaint Review and Mediation Scheme and

    the Postmaster Litigation Steering Group. I was also a witness for POL in the

    Common Issues and Horizon Issues trials (further details below).

11. Since leaving POL in May 2020, after a short period as Head of People with



    operated as a freelance HR Consultant.




12. In respect of the Horizon IT System, the Inquiry have provided me with the

    following documents, which I have reviewed and reflected on below:




        b. POL00041564 (Computer Weekly article dated 11 May 2009);




           on 5 December 2010); and

       e. POL0O294728 (email from Tracy Marshall to me on 5 January 2011).




    refers to a Mrs Pugh, who was a SPM at Chirbury Post Office from 21 April

    1999 to 3 September 2001, when her contract for services was suspended.

    The email requests assistance with obtaining information to assist the Legal

    Services Department with preparing statements for Mrs Pugh's Court case,

    relating to her final audit and the Post Office accounting system. I did not

    remember this email prior to the Inquiry providing it to me so I requested a

    copy of my response to this email and the subsequent email chain

    (POL00178200). From the email provided, I can see that I forwarded Clive

    Burton's email to Emlyn Hughes (Contract Manager within my team at the

    time) to deal with the request for information. Emlyn forwarded the email to

    contacts within the business (as that information was not within our team), to

    provide the information to Clive Burton. I can see that this was treated as a

    routine request for information. I am unable to add anything beyond what is

    contained in the email chains (POL00178200, POL00178201, POL00178208,

    P0L00178211, P0L00178219, POL00178223, P0L00178221 and

    POL00178225).




14. Document POL00041564 is a Computer Weekly article dated 11 May 2009

    entitled `Bankruptcy, prosecution and disrupted livelihoods — Postmasters tell

    their story'- I do not recall seeing this article at the time it was published, or at

    any time subsequently, prior to it being provided to me by the Inquiry.

    However, I am familiar with the SPM's cases which it discusses.




15. Document POL00026572 is the Rod Ismay Report dated 2 August 2010. I

    had no knowledge or involvement in the preparation of the report. I was not on

    the initial distribution list and so I did not receive this report when it was first

    produced on 2 August 2010. In terms of the content of the report, it reinforces

    POL's understanding and internal messaging at the time that Horizon was

    robust and that:



                                     Page 8 of 132
                                                                                      W ITN09900100
                                                                                   WITNO9900100




        a. Only "authorised" branch users could create or accept transactions in

           the system


        b. "all transactions and events are tagged and traceable to the user"


        c. "Sequential referencing of transactions, customer basket and

           associated IDS. Prevent gaps, duplications or anonymous

           transactions."


        d. "Audit file and read only control — transaction records securely sealed"




16. Whilst I cannot recall receiving the report, I assume that I would have been

    reassured by its content at the time. However, knowing what I know now (as a

    result of the Group Litigation Order trials and what has been presented to the

    Inquiry), the report in my view was/is inaccurate on a number of points.

    Importantly, it seems that full investigations were not carried out at the time as

    Horizon was not considered as a possible or potential factor to the losses and

    notably the report states that there is an "absence of 'backdoors"" whereas I

    now understand the Fujitsu Super Users did have access to branch accounts.




17. Documents POL00088956 and POL00088957 are two emails from John

    Breeden to me on 5 December 2010. I do not recall seeing these emails

    before and requested further disclosure on any response that I made to

    John's email, as well as any subsequent emails in this chain to help me

    understand what I did as a result of receiving these emails. However, POL

    has been unable to locate any response from me.

18. Document POL00088957 is an email forwarding me a copy of the Rod Ismay

    Report. Neither the email nor Rod Ismay's report stick out in my memory as

    something important that I received prior to the Inquiry. In hindsight, I

    appreciate the importance of this report in that it reinforced POL's position that

    Horizon was robust but I cannot recall it registering as something important at

    the time.




19. Document PL0008956 is another email from John Breeden to me on 5

    December 2010. Again, 1 cannot recall this email or the content of the pack

    he attaches. Having reviewed the email, I have noted that Lynn Hobbs

    (General Manager of Network Support) advised Mike Granville and Rod

    Ismay that she had "found out that Fujitsu can actually put an entry into a

    branch account remotely." In her email to John Breeden, she says she had

    discussed with Mike Granville and Andy McLean (POL's senior IT team) were

    looking into the "remote access to Horizon issues" but no update was given at

    that point. I have asked for any subsequent emails in this chain to help me

    understand what I did as a result of receiving these emails but POL have

    been unable to locate a response from me. I would have expected to see

    something further and my only explanation is that either IT did respond and

    provided a plausible explanation or else IT did not respond and it dropped off

    the radar because Lynn subsequently left the organisation and we were

    getting messaging from the business that disputed it i.e. remote access was

    not possible. Although 1 cannot recall, I assume that I satisfied myself that

    senior people within IT were aware and looking into it and that no further

                                   Page 10 of 132

                                                                                  WITNO9900100




    action was needed from myself unless told otherwise. Again, with the benefit

    of hindsight, I wholly appreciate the importance of this comment and I have

    questioned myself, knowing what I know now, as to why it did not register. I

    have, however, noted that Tracy Marshall's email a month later (document

    P0L00294728) also references the ability for Fujitsu to have remote access

    stating "Technically, Fujitsu could access an individual branch remotely and

    move money around however this has never happened yet. . _so although

    changes can be made remotely, they would be spotted and the person

    making the change would be identified." I assume that in the period, between

    December 2010 and January 2011, the issue of `remote access' was explored

    by POL with this being the outcome. I have discussed the content of this email

    in further detail below, in my response to questions about the Ferndown

    meeting.




20. The below deals with the nature and extent of my knowledge of the Horizon IT

    system when it was first introduced to the business.




21. As a Branch Manager in the late 90s, I worked with the forerunner to the

    Horizon IT system for around 1 — 2 years. This system was then replaced by

    the Horizon IT system which was the same system rolled out to the whole

    network of post offices from 2000 onwards. I distinctively remember the

    messaging from the Post Office, that the Horizon system was the largest and

    most secure system in Europe at that time.

                                                                                   WITNO9900100




22. In terms of what training I received on the Horizon IT System, I was working

    as a Retail Network Manager/Area Manager when Horizon was rolled out to

    sub -post offices. i believe that I received the same level of training as a

    Branch Manager/SPM, which from memory was around 1.512 days. This was

    at a local hotel where the trainers had set up Horizon equipment for the

    purposes of training and we were taught how to operate it. I also attended the

    training sessions that my SPMs and their staff attended (I believe that this

    was 1 day for counter assistants and an additional half day/day for SPMs and

    those assistants involved in the preparation and production of the branch cash

    account) to support them through the process. I do not recall any particular

    concern from SPMs about the training at the time other than it was going to be

    a new way of working in branch for them. As Retail Network Managers, we

    had planned to be in branch with SPMs for their first few cash accounts to

    offer our support in embedding the training they had received and also to help

    them with any misbalancing issues should there be any.




23. In terms of ARQ data, I believe that my first knowledge of ARQ data was

    when Helen Rose used it to look into what had happened at the Ferndown

    Post Office branch in preparation for the meeting with the SPM on 6 January

    2011 (discussed further below).




24. I cannot recall now exactly what detail the ARQ data gave us, however my

    understanding was that it provided insight into what had happened on the

    Horizon system at the branch level. It therefore gave the information we

    needed to piece together the picture of what had happened in a branch.

25. The next reference that I remember to ARQ data was when Helen Rose was

    looking into the issues experienced at Lepton as part of the Spot Review

    process with Second Sight in early 2013 (Jan/Feb 2013).




26. Following this, I recall that when the Initial Complaint and Mediation Scheme

    ("the Scheme") was established in August 2013, ARQ data was part of the

    data/information pack that the Case Review Advisors used to investigate the

    issues raised by the Scheme applications.




27. With the Scheme investigations concluded, the Support Services Resolution

    Team was created (April 2015) to investigate any issues raised by post office

    branches as part of 'Business As Usual'. They used the investigation

    approach developed for the Scheme and ARQ data continued to be part of

    the data/information pack (event and transaction logs, Helpline logs, branch

    trading reports, training records and others depending on the issue raised)

    used by the team.




29. The first time I recall becoming formally aware of any bugs, errors or defects

    in the Horizon IT system ("BEDS" — although this wasn't the term used at the

    time), was when POL disclosed to Second Sight two anomalies — `Receipts

    and Payments Mismatch Problem' and the `Local Suspense Account Problem'

    which were detailed in the Interim Report 8 July 2013 (POL00099063). From

                                  Page 13 of 132

                                                                                   WITNO9900100




    memory, Second Sight were putting together their report and the Legal team

    said that they had been made aware of a couple of anomalies which they

    needed to disclose. This was the first that I had heard of any bugs so it was a

    surprise but I remember being reassured by the IT experts that bugs of this

    sort were pretty routine and computer systems always have errors such as

    these. Although, looking back at the timeline, this was the first revelation that

    there were any bugs in the system at all, I do not recall that it set alarm bells

    ringing as the IT experts were not concerned. The line was that these weren't

    major, had been spotted and resolved and it was business as usual.




30. Prior to this, I was aware of general 'rumblings' of complaints and concerns

    about the integrity of Horizon and I believe that when I took over the

    responsibility for the Contract and Administration team, I became aware of

    claims that the Horizon system itself was generating the discrepancies in

    branches. These complaints were further formalised towards the end of 2011,

    upon receipt of letters of claim from Shoosmiths when we started to engage

    with Alan Bates/Justice For SPMs Alliance ("JFSA") and later with Second

    Sight in 2012. However, these complaints and concerns were all against the

    backdrop of the very strong POL message that the Horizon system was

    robust and the internally held view that all of these complaints were

    unsubstantiated claims from disgruntled former SPMs. As mentioned in the

    paragraph above, it was only when POL disclosed to Second Sight that there

    were two anomalies within Horizon in 2013, that there was any suggestion the

    system was not fool-proof but, even then, a rational explanation was provided

    by IT experts. The strong message from POL continued to be that remote

                                                                                    WITNO9900100




    access' by either Fujitsu or POL employees to alter data in branch accounts

    was not possible.




31. Pre-2011, 1 had no knowledge of the ability of Fujitsu employees to alter

    transaction data or data in branch accounts without the knowledge or consent

    of SPMs. In early 2011, I received an email from Tracy Marshall

    (POL00294728) (discussed in further detail below) which made me aware that

    Fujitsu employees could, in theory, have remote access but not without the

    knowledge of SPMs.




32. Below, I have detailed the key messages from POL on remote

    access/integrity of the Horizon system that shaped my understanding over the

    years. These extracts all show a strong message that Horizon was robust and

    altering data via remote access was not a plausible explanation for branch

    discrepancies. I highlight these extracts to try to help the Inquiry to understand

    what the internal messaging was within POL at the time in respect of remote

    access. Where concerns were raised, there always appeared to be a rational

    explanation that countered the initial allegation. I do not think that this was just

    from a PR perspective, but a genuine belief which appeared to be supported

    by IT experts. Despite clarification being sought over the years the message

    that Horizon was robust, never changed.

                 access potentially being used to change branch data/transaction is

                 simply: 'This is not and never has been possible'. There is no remote

k. 21 July 2016: Remote access wording presented by Bond Dickinson to

   Office) has the capability to inject a new °transaction"into a branch's

   accounts. This is called a balancing transaction.. .A balancing

   transaction can add a transaction to the branch's accounts but it cannot

   edit or delete other data in those accounts. Balancing transactions only

   exist within Horizon Online (not the old version of Horizon) and so have

   been in use since around 2010...Access to databases. There are a

   small number of persons at Fujitsu (not Post Office) who have special

   permissions to access and edit, within strict controls, the databases

   and servers that sit behind Horizon. Use of these permissions is logged

   and so there would be an audit trail of any activity undertaken using

   these permissions._.During the Scheme, it was alleged that Post Office

   had the ability to `remotely access Horizon in order to conduct

   transactions. This allegation is understood to mean that a Post Office

   (or Fujitsu) employee could log on to a terminal in a branch from a

   different location outside the branch and conduct (or edit or delete)

   customer transactions. To be clear: this is not possible."

33. When presented with this information, I took the experts at their word. To

    learn that this was incorrect shocked me deeply.




34. In the midst of this messaging, there were genuine cases where SPMs

    complained about Horizon IT system causing issues but, when investigated, it

    was proved that they (or their assistants) caused the error. I remember

    distinctively a SPM writing to Paula Vennells that an error had occurred in his

    branch. He was extremely diligent and experienced and was confident that he

    had not caused the error and that therefore it must be the Horizon system.

    Paula asked me to investigate and so my team went to the branch.

    Unusually, the SPM had CCTV positioned so perfectly, you could see the

    counter transactions. The team honed in on a Saturday morning transaction,

    which was a £1k deposit into a bank account. In the CCTV footage you can

    see the SPM serve the customer and process the £1 k deposit on Horizon,

    however rather than taking a £1 k from the customer he mistakenly gave the

    customer a £1 k as if the customer was making a withdrawal . This resulted in a

    £2k loss on balancing. It was instances such as this that leaned me more

    towards the thinking that discrepancies were more likely to be caused by user

    error rather than issues with Horizon, as even the best SPM could make

    mistakes.

          a. Provision of advice and assistance to SPMs in respect of disputed

             shortfalls


          b. Training on the Horizon IT system


          c. POL's audit of SPM's branch accounts and/or seeking the recovery of

Provision of advice and assistance to SPMs in respect of disputed shortfalls


 36. Prior to 2011 I had no involvement in the provision of advice and assistance to

      SPMs in respect of disputed shortfalls.




 37. In terms of how often SPMs would raise concerns about the Horizon IT

      system, I am not aware of this information or that it was specifically tracked

38. The immediate reporting route for Post Office branches for problems with

    Horizon was the Horizon Service Helpdesk (Fujitsu) and/or the Network

    Business Support Centre (NBSC         "the Helpline"). From what I recall, if a

    disputed shortfall was a result of a Transaction Correction, the SPM would

    contact the FSC. If they were unable to assist, they would refer to the Dispute

    Resolution Manager (Andrew Winn) for further investigation. If the disputed

    shortfall was due to an in- branch misbalance, the SPM would ring the Helpline

    for assistance in the first instance. If still disputed, they would again be

    referred to the FSC and/or Dispute Resolution Manager for investigation. This

    was both pre and post 2011.



39. When the Scheme was established in August 2013, I led POL's investigation

    into the issues raised in the 150 cases submitted to the scheme. Part of this

    investigation process was to look into the level of advice and assistance that

    had been provided to SPMs. On looking at the detail of the advice and

    support provided to some SPMs in the Scheme I was disappointed to see a

    lack of support from Area Managers/Retail Network Managers in some cases.

    These were roles that I had done previously, and I had gone out of my way to

    provide the best support I could to SPMs, on occasions working late into the

    evenings to do so and I was disappointed to see that some SPMs did not

    receive what I regard as an appropriate level of support.




40. The Helpline was the first port of call for SPMs who were having issues with

    Horizon and frorn April 2015 — December 2016, as Director of Support

    Services, part of my responsibilities included oversight of the Helpline, which

    included identifying its shortcoming and trying to fix them.



41. On 24 October 2016, 1 co-authored a paper with Marc Reardon that stated

    "Horizon Help (the in-branch support tool) has since its introduction over a

    decade ago fallen short of delivering the in-branch self-help functionality that

    was promised as part of Horizon roll-out and that postmasters and their

    assistants desperately need."This paper has not been disclosed but is

    referenced at paragraph 420 of Bates v Post Office Ltd [2019] EWHC 606

    (QB). The paper shone a spotlight on the weaknesses of the system as I

    wanted to land the point about its shortcomings to get a business case over

    the line for its improvements. Whilst the Helpline was adequate in terms of its

    content, it wasn't the easiest or quickest to navigate. I remember that i wanted

    to upgrade the system so that it operated like a google search, where SPMs

    could search for an issue and get a response quickly. Another issue, was that

    Helpline operators were relying on the SPM to describe the problem

    accurately so that they could assist, whereas often the SPM didn't know what

    had caused the problem. I can recall wanting to put in place a system

    whereby SPMs could share their screen with the Helpline operators to

    improve the assistance that Helpline could offer. Unfortunately, this was never

    implemented. I regret that I was not able to get either of these improvements

    implemented.




42. In considering whether the advice and assistance available to SPMs was

    adequate, my view is yes on the whole, however I think this depended very

    much on the person who was supporting the SPM. As mentioned above, the

    Scheme revealed that there were occasions when the Area Managers or

    Retail Network Managers did not provide what I regarded as adequate

    support.




43. Pre-2011, when the Horizon IT system was being rolled out to Post Office

    branches, I had been a recipient of that training in my role as Retail Network

    Manager. As detailed above, I also attended the training sessions that my

    SPMs and their staff attended, to support them through the process and on

    roll out, I along with my colleagues, supported SPMs in branch with their first

    few cash accounts.




44. In my view, the initial Horizon IT training in advance of roll-out in 1999/2000

    appeared to be adequate for the SPMs within my area. From memory, some

    SPMs adapted better than others and in my role as Retail Network Manager I

    was on hand to support where required but I don't recall any particular issues

    with the training. For new SPMs and staff appointed post the Horizon roll-out,

    using the Horizon system was embedded into the new entrant training. Again,

     I don't recall any specific issues.




45. From December 2010 — August 2012, as Head of Network Services, I had

    responsibility for the Audit and Training team. I believe at this time they were

    called Field Support Advisors. My oversight of this team was to ensure that

                                                                                   WITNO9900100




    training was appropriate and delivered to a good standard and that the team

    was appropriately resourced. The scheduling of training was done by the

    Scheduling & Admin team. Feedback on the quality of the training delivered

    was tracked through a customer satisfaction survey that those receiving the

    training were asked to complete at the end of their training.




46. In this role I initiated a review of the new entrant training approach which was

    led by the Network Support Projects and Standards Manager. Upon review,

    the training for new entrant SPMs needed to be reconfigured as it pretty much

    was a one size fits all and didn't reflect the new Post Office models e.g.

    Mains, Locals, outreaches and their specific training requirements (Mains did

    the full range of products and services whereas Locals had a limited

    range).This review resulted in a revised training approach that better

    recognised the different types of post offices in the network and therefore

    made the training more relevant.



47. In my role as Branch Support Programme Director from August 2013 — March

    2015, we looked into issues around training. Problems identified and rectified

    included: introducing an introductory call to new SPMs 2 weeks before they

    took up post; replacing a telephone call 1 month after they had taken up post

    with a branch visit from a trainer; refreshing training on balancing to help

    SPMs identify and resolve balancing problems earlier.

POL's audit of SPM's branch accounts and/or seeking the recovery of alleged

shortfalls in branch accounts


  48. As noted above, from December 2010 — August 2012, as Head of Network

      Services, I had responsibility for the Audit and Training team. This role

      including having general oversight of the auditing team to make sure that they

      did their jobs properly and were adequately resourced. Audits were scheduled

      by the Scheduling & Admin team. There were different types of audits: risk

      based audits were scheduled using a tool (Branch Performance Profile) that

      used a number of criteria the details of which I can't remember now, however

       I believe holding more cash in branch than it should was one; Special Audits,

      which were requested usually from P&BA (later known as FSC), the Fraud

       Forum or the Security team in response to concerns they had; and Transfer

      Audits, which were done when transferring a branch from the outgoing SPM

      to the incoming SPM. Audits were also requested to establish actual loss

      following a robbery or burglary at a branch. The Network Support Projects and

      Standards Manager (direct report to me) produced a report each month on the

      summary of the findings at audit which fed into a quarterly report I did for the

      Audit & Risk Committee that I attended (POL00141432 is the Q1 2012/2013

      report).




  49. Another area of focus for me was spending time with the Field Support

      Advisors and their Team Leaders to understand the mood within the team and

      importantly what was affecting that mood - what was working well, what




                                    Page 26 of 132
                                                                                       W ITN09900100
                                                                                      WITNO9900100




      wasn't, what were the improvement opportunities - so that we could constantly

      improve as a team in supporting SPMs better.




 50. Should an audit uncover a shortage, under the terms of the SPM contract,

      failure to make good a shortfall could be escalated to the Contract Manager

      as a potential breach of contract. Again, as Head of Network Services I was

      responsible for the Contract Managers. Their role was to investigate whether

      there was breach of contract and, depending on the seriousness of any

      breach, they would consider whether action was necessary, taking into

      account any mitigating circumstances usually discussed during an interview

      with the SPM.




POL's procedures for resolving disputes with SPMs in respect of discrepancies in

branch accounts


   51. Prior to 2011, 1 did not have any involvement in, or oversight of, resolving

      disputes with SPMs in respect of discrepancies with branch accounts.



   52. From August 2013 — March 2015 I was Branch Support Programme Director.

      The Branch Support Programme sought to make improvements for SPMs by

      addressing key issues raised in the Second Sight Interim Report and some

      issues raised in the Scheme, including helping improve procedures for

      resolving disputes with SPMs in respect of discrepancies in branch accounts.

      For example, there was criticism that the process for resolving disputes was

      slow. I used the programme to refine processes so POL reacted more


                                     Page 27 of 132
                                                                                    W ITNO9900100
                                                                                   WITNO9900100




    responsively to reports of unexplained losses by fast-tracking them to the

    Branch Support Team for resolution. If further investigation was needed, the

    case was referred to the Mediation Case Review team (later called the

    Support Services Resolution team) who had the benefit of real time data tool

    from Fujitsu, enabling analysis to be undertaken at the point it happened

    rather than waiting for historical data to be gathered.




53. 1 also looked into suspensions and in 2014 I introduced 'suspended

    termination', a new category of action in dealing with material breaches of

    contract. The usual process was, if a discrepancy was found which was over

    a certain amount (from memory I think £1,000), the SPM would be suspended

    immediately pending investigation. The new approach recognised that the

    previous policy of precautionary suspending the SPM whilst investigations

    were done, potentially damaged the reputation of the SPM in their community

    regardless of whether the SPM was reinstated or not. The essence of the new

    approach was that suspending a SPM was the last resort. The majority of the

    investigative work was to be done in advance of the audit (rather than after

    the audit had taken place, as per the previous approach) and the Contracts

    Manager was to work with the SPM to establish the facts and then take the

    appropriate action, keeping the SPM in post and the branch operational

    wherever possible. This reduced the number of SPM suspensions by around

    50% in the year of its introduction.

  54. From April 2015 — December 2016, my role as Director of Support Services

      included oversight of the FSC. Originally, it was part of the FSC role to help

      resolve disputes with SPMs in respect of discrepancies at branch accounts.

      This work was migrated to the Support Services Resolution Team from 2015

      onwards, part of my broader team who used the investigation approach

      developed for the Scheme.




POL's prosecutorial function


  55. I had no involvement with, or oversight of, POL's prosecutorial function.




POL's handling of complaints made by or litigation involving SPMs in which the

integrity or adequacy of the Horizon IT System was raised




  56. From memory, these were all handled by POL's Legal team, although

      requests for information were routinely made to the Contracts and

      Administration team, for example for training and audit records. When I

      became a member of the POL JFSA Steering Group, I believe that my role

      was to help coordinate any requests for information from my Network

      Services team, although I cannot recall the specifics.




  57. In addition, as part of the Second Sight Spot Review process, I coordinated

      information from within POL to assist Second Sight with their investigations. I

      was also a member of the Working Group, the purpose of which was to


                                    Page 29 of 132

                                                                                 WITNO9900100




    oversee/ensure a fair and transparent process for applicants to the Scheme.

    Further details on the Scheme and my involvement in it are below.




58. The below deals with my recollection of an interview undertaken in respect of

    the Ferndown Branch, Dorset on 6 January 2011. In answering the Inquiry's

    questions about the Interview, I have reviewed the interview notes




59. 1 first became aware of the Ferndown branch when Lynn Hobbs (General

    Manager Network Support) contacted me about providing a mobile Post

    Office service near to the Ferndown branch if it were to close/remain closed.

    The closure was as a result of an audit and subsequent suspension of the

    SPM. I advised Lynn that I could provide a mobile post office to be set up near

    the branch however I did not think that it would cope with the volume of

    business that Ferndown transacts (this was a sizeable post office).




60. Although I do not recall the precise date that I was contacted, it would have



    Network Services role. I can remember that this was a high -profile case, as it

    had attracted a lot of media attention and had been raised with Dave Smith

    (POL Managing Director at the time) and Paula Vennells, to whom Lynn

    Hobbs reported direct.

                                                                                 WITNO9900100




61. My next involvement was when Kevin Gilliland, Network Director, asked me to

    attend an interview with him due to my line manager (Sue Huggins — a direct

    report to Kevin) being away on holiday. The interview was to be with the SPM

    of the Ferndown branch, Mrs Rachpal Athwal and to take place on 6 January

    2011. From POL's perspective, I believe that the overarching purpose of the

    meeting was to reset the relationship with the SPM and her husband,

    following the suspension of the SPM due to a discrepancy at the branch. The

    SPM and her husband didn't believe that they were responsible for that

    discrepancy and so the focus of the meeting was to find out what had

    happened in the branch to generate the discrepancy.




62. Helen Rose, from the Security and Investigations team, was also asked to

    attend the interview, to provide an insight into what had happened in the

    branch using the relevant reports from the Horizon system. Helen's role at the

    interview was to walk through what the Horizon information was indicating had

    happened in respect of user activity on the Horizon system. My role in the

    meeting was to support Kevin (who led the meeting) in providing a more

    operational level of knowledge and experience. This was the first time I had

    ever attended an interview with a SPM and I think that I was asked because

    Kevin's operational experience was limited, whereas I had more extensive

    and recent operational experience from working closely with branches.



63. The transcript from the interview is at P0L00294743. During the interview I

    stated that nobody in POL could remotely access the in-branch Horizon

    system because it is all done from a user ID. I also said that nobody from

                                 Page 31 of 132
                                                                                     W ITNO9900100
                                                                                    WITNO9900100




    Fujitsu could go in and amend the accounts without having been seen to have

    done so. This information was based on an email received from Tracy

    Marshall the day before the meeting (5 January 2011) (POL00294728). In this

    email Tracy stated POL cannot remotely access systems and make changes

    to specific stock units etc."She also stated that Fujitsu can remotely access

    systems but "although changes can be made remotely, they would be spotted

    and the person making the change would be identified_" I understand that

    Tracy provided this information specifically for this meeting. I had not been

    involved in this previously and would not have had first-hand knowledge or

    experience of this level of detail on Horizon and from my comments in the

    transcript, I seem to have taken this information from Tracy at face value. I

    would not have had any reason to doubt its accuracy and whilst cannot

    remember my thought process at the time, I expect I was reassured by her

    experience and the fact she has stated "the authority process required and

    the audit process are robust enough to prevent this activity [changes made

    remotely] from being undertaken fraudulently_ "With hindsight and a better

    understanding of what access Fujitsu had into individual branch accounts, I

    know now that the information I provided in respect of Fujitsu was incomplete.

    At the time, I did not know that to be the case.




64. The below deals with the nature and extent of my involvement in POL's

    response to the litigation threatened by Shoosmiths / Access Legal who were

    acting for several former SPMs who had come together in the JFSA.




                                  Page 32 of 132

                                                                                    WITNO9900100




65. In answering the Inquiry's questions on this issue, I have reviewed the

    following:




        a. POL00046944 - This is a letter of claim in respect of Mr Wilson (former

           SPM), dated 23 August 2011. 1 do not recall having seen this letter

           before although I can see that it is referenced (but not attached) in

           document POL00176467.


        b. POL00294879 - The Inquiry have referred to this document as 'Terms

           of Reference for Steering Group'. As I understand it, this is an email

           from Rod Ismay to the proposed members of a JFSA Steering Group

           and whilst it sets out the purpose of the Group and the current situation

           in respect of Shoosmiths (Access 'Legal), it does not detail any terms of

           reference.


        c. POL00176467 — This is an email from me to my Network Services lead

           team, ensuring that they were aware of the advice from POL's legal

           team in respect of the JFSA cases.




66. From my recollection, POL's response to the litigation threatened by

    Shoosmiths / Access Legal was very much led by the Legal team. Having

    reviewed POL00294879, my involvement was predominately due to the

    Ferndown meeting (detailed above). However, as Head of Network Services,

    the Contracts and Admin team, trainers and auditors were part of my

    responsibility and so I would have been able to facilitate the provision of

    information/documents from my team that the Legal team required. My role


                                  Page 33 of 132
                                                                                    W ITN09900100
                                                                                 WITNO9900100




    meant that I was in a position to get information to lawyers as quickly as

    possible. I later became the 'go to' person for information (for the Spot Review

    with Second Sight and then the Scheme) as I knew my way around the

    business and if I didn't know the answer myself, it was highly likely that I knew

    the person who did.




67. In terms of POL's strategy in responding to the Shoosmiths litigation, this was

    prior to the 2012 separation and so would have been led by Royal Mail rather

    than POL. I don't recall seeing anything that set out any strategy however, as

    detailed in the email from Rod Ismay to proposed members of the JFSA

    Steering Group (POL00294879), the purpose of that group was "To define

    and manage a coordinated response plan which defends existing challenges

    and deters future challenges, in the most pragmatic and efficient manner". I

    can remember that this was the approach and tone of the discussions that

    took place, with the lead being taken by Royal Mail's Legal team.




68. In my email dated 21 October 2011 (POL00176467), I forward an email from

    Emily Springford of the Legal team, which gave instructions around three

    headings: document preservation; document creation; and information

    required to respond to letters before action. My email asks everyone to read

    Emily's email and lists three bullet points, which appear to be my

    interpretation of the key takeaway points from each of these headings:




                                  Page 34 of 132
                                                                                      W ITN09900100
                                                                                     WITNO9900100




        a. `preserve all documents which might potentially be relevant to these

               claims_.."

            b. "Mark communications in relation to these cases and as detailed below

               as `legally privileged and confidential"

        c. "Treat any request for information in relation to these cases as a

               priority"




69. The Inquiry have specifically asked me why I wrote the second bullet point —

    "Mark communications in relation to these cases and as detailed below as

    "legally privileged and confidential". I believe that this was my key takeaway

    point from Emily's instructions under the heading `Document Creation' and so

     I wanted to highlight it to the team, as I had highlighted my key takeaway

    points from the other two headings.




70. My email to the team was to ensure that they were sighted on the potential

    legal action in respect of these cases and that they were aware of, and

    complied with, the instructions set out in Emily's email. I was passing on the

    instructions from the Legal team and my email was intended to summarise

    Emily's email, with the overarching message that her email should be read in

    full.




71. The Inquiry have asked to what extent. if at all, legal professional privilege

    was used within POL to try to prevent the disclosure of documents that could


                                      Page 35 of 132

                                                                                 WITN09900100




    prejudice its position in relation to the Horizon IT System. During my time with

    POL, I do not believe that it was.




72. Preparing responses to MPs or journalists was the responsibility of the

    Communications Team. As I understand, when they received a question, they

    would reach out to the relevant contacts within POL to obtain information for

    any response and may ask for the content to be reviewed for accuracy before

    they responded.



73. In terms of the extent to which I was involved in preparing PG L's response to

    MPs who raised concerns about the integrity of Horizon in early 2012, my

    involvement was to provide information, when requested, to those within POL




           Perkins and Paula Vennells on 6 June 2012 which attaches the Terms

           of Reference for Second Sight. I was copied into this email but I was

           not involved in setting or agreeing the Terms of Reference for Second

           Sight.

          Arbuthnot and other MPs on 18 June 2012.




75. The Inquiry have asked about my involvement in briefing Paula Vennells,

    Alice Perkins and other senior managers or Board members on the integrity of

    the Horizon IT System (including remote access). I did not do the briefings on

    the integrity of the system (including remote access) and I did not have the

    technical knowledge to be able to do this. Any such information came directly

    from Fujitsu (Pete Newsome was the Fujitsu Account/Relationship Manager

    assigned to POL) and was passed on/briefed to senior managers by either/ a

    combination of: the POL IT team and / or the Project Sparrow team. I was

    very much in `receiving mode' in respect of any information/messages

    regarding the integrity of the Horizon system i.e. I did not brief any senior

    managers / Board members but was myself a recipient of the information.



76. Whilst I do remember going to the meeting with Lord Arbuthnot on 18 June

    2012, 1 do not remember much about the meeting itself. I do, however,

    remember the prior meeting with James Arbuthnot and Oliver Letwin, held at

    the Post Offices in Old Street on 10 May 2012 and I believe that the meeting

    on 18 June 2012 was a follow-on from this initial meeting. I believe that my

    involvement in the preparation for both meetings was to pull together the

    information on the two cases — Hamilton and Merritt — to be able to explain to

    the MPs from the information we had, what had happened in these cases and

    to provide any further information as per the action points in document

    P0L.00137248.

77. 1 cannot recall the specifics as to my involvement with POL's response to MPs

    and journalists who raised concerns as to the integrity of the Horizon IT

    System, however, typically my involvement related to issues that a SPM

    constituent had raised with their MP. I did meet (usually accompanied with

    Patrick Bourke) with some MPs at the request of their constituent to discuss

    their issues/Scheme case as appropriate). I also attended the meetings with

    MPs — 10 March 2012 and 18 June 2012. In respect of journalists, other than

    the Panorama meeting 9 June 2015, my involvement was usually to provide

    information to the Communication Team for them to respond to the journalists.




78. I had no involvement in POL's decision making process in respect of the

    appointment of Second Sight or the ambit of its investigation. I believe that

    these decisions were joint between Alice Perkins (POL Chair), Paula Vennells

    (CEO) and POL Board and that it was endorsed by the MPs (predominately

    Lord Arbuthnot) and JFSA. I recall some internal discussions about getting an

    external IT expert, such as Deloitte (or another appropriately qualified

    organisation), to do a deep dive into the Horizon system, but this was

    dismissed in favour of Second Sight.




79. In terms of the ambit of its investigation, I have reviewed POL00113791:

    Second Sight's Terms of Reference as is detailed in the email from Susan

    Crichton to Alice Perkins dated 6 June 2012 and POL00022378 POL's Initial

                                                                                 WITNO9900100




    Complaint Review and Mediation Scheme Report which states that "the Post

    Office commissioned Second Sight Support Services Limited to carry out an

    independent review of its Horizon computer system, which is Supplied to the

    Post Office by Fujitsu Services Limited, in response to allegations by a small

    number of former Postmasters about the integrity of that system. "




80. The document also states "The basis of Second Sight's initial engagement,

    was reflected in a document for Postmasters entitled "Raising Concerns with

    Horizon".. and included to_ "Consider and advise on whether there were any

    systemic issues and or concerns with the Horizon system including training

    and support processes, giving evidence and reasons for the conclusions

    reached. "




81. My working recollection of the ambit of Second Sight's investigation was that

    they were to investigate the issues regarding Horizon raised by SPMs via their

    MP and/or JFSA. Following the feedback from Second Sight that they couldn't

    look in isolation at the Horizon system but rather they also needed to consider

    associated elements, their scope broadened to include looking at: training and

    support provided to SPMs; operational processes including balancing; branch

    trading and transaction corrections; interfaces with other systems e.g. lottery

    machine, ATMs; power supply and telecoms equipment; and the effectiveness

    of POL's audit and investigative processes.

 82. As to who had responsibility for the extent of its access to relevant information

    and documents, the flow of information and documents was, in the main,

    through the Project Sparrow. When the Scheme was established, the Working

    Group (chaired by Sir Anthony F-looper) did, I believe, also have oversight of

    the provision of relevant information and documents. In terms of my role, due

    to my operational experience, I could effectively bridge the gap between Head

    Office and SPMs so I would often be asked to provide information.




83. l have laid out below my review of the following documents which the Inquiry

    have provided to me in respect of Second Sight:




              2013);




        C,    POL00115919 (draft briefing note to Paula Vennells dated 2 July

              2013);

        e. POL00065349 (my draft letter to Karen Lumley MP)




             Ht]iii i1 IM




    states that, to ensure that there is appropriate governance for the Horizon

    investigation, Simon is setting up a monthly project and governance board.

    The broad terms of the Board and how it relates to the overall project

    governance are attached (POLOO186111). This states that there will be three

    levels of governance: Sponsor Board; Project Board and Team Meeting.



85. Document POLOO296463 is an email from me to Simon Baker on 9 May

    2013. This emails relates to 4 Spot Review' responses that I was asked to

    comment on. This is an example of where I might be involved to provide

    information/comments due to my operational experience. My comments

    reflect my approach of working openly and transparently with Second Sight

    and in the spirit of what we agreed:




           "Intentionally not answering questions raised by 2nd Sight will in my

           view give rise to suspicion i.e. that we have something to hide and is

           not in the spirit of our interaction/engagement with Ron and ian. By

           trying to dodge answers that may riot present POL as positively as we

           would like will in the long term come back to bite us. I would much

           rather be upfront from the start. There is always a risk that our policies,

           procedures and processes would come under the spotlight and in

          some cases be deemed to not be as good as some would expect

           whether this expectation is reasonable or otherwise — this was a risk I

           believe we accepted from the start and whilst the integrity of the

           Horizon system may be intact we should not ignore any lessons that

           come out of these investigations.''

86. Document POL00115919 is a draft internal briefing note to Paula Vennells on

    `Second Sight review into Horizon — Implications of Interim Report'. This was

    a briefing note prepared for Paula in advance of her meeting with James

    Arbuthnot MP, to update her on the likely content of Second Sight's Interim

    Report and the potential risks associated with it.




87. Document POL00141432 is a Post Office Branch Audit Trend Analysis dated

    7 September 2012 written by me. Annexed to this is a flow chart to investigate

    Horizon claims from branches. At page 3 of this document I have stated

    "discrepancies in branch are typically as a result of a cash error over the

    counter..." Without seeing the information that sits behind the summary table,

    I am unable to say exactly why I concluded this to be the case, however what

    I have set out as examples reflected what I understood to be the most

    common causes of discrepancies within branches through my experience at

    that time.




88. Document POL00065349 is a draft letter from me to Karen Lumley MP

    responding to a letter sent from Karen to Paula Vennells on 11 June. Although

    undated, I assume that this was in 2015. The letter is in relation to Julian

    Wilson's case and it explains the Scheme and that mediation is a voluntary

    process for both parties. Having reviewed the letter, I take from my response

    that POL would not mediate this case due to a previous Court

    ruling/conviction. The Inquiry have asked me how I satisfied myself that the

    contents of this letter were accurate. I cannot recall from memory and as I

    have only had sight of this letter and no related correspondence, I can only

    say that any correspondence that I drafted/sent in relation to the Scheme had

    the input from the Project Sparrow team, POL's legal team and the Cornrns

    team. I am therefore confident that I would have satisfied myself of its content

    through discussions and verification with them.




89. As to how senior managers within POL viewed Second Sight and the purpose

    of its investigation, in my view there were two parts to Second Sight's

    investigation: the investigations as part of the Scheme and the investigations

    pre this scheme i.e. Spot Reviews. From my observations, the senior

    managers within POL (connected with Project Sparrow) who engaged with

    Alan Bates/JFSA and subsequently appointed Second Sight, did so with a

    genuine desire to get to the truth. That is, to find out if there was any

    substance in the claims from JFSA and other SPMs through their MPs, that

    the Horizon system was responsible for the losses in their branches that they

    had been held responsible for by POL. I think the view of Second Sight

    changed over time, when there became a frustration at the slow delivery of

    any output. I have provided further detail on Second Sight below.

90. The below sets out the nature and extent of my involvement in the creation of

    the Helen Rose Report' dated 12 June 2013 (FUJ00086811) and POL's

    response to the same. The report looked into a transaction that took place at

    Lepton SPSO 19130 on 4 October 2012 for £76.09. On the same day, the

    payment was reversed and the branch was issued with a Transaction

    Correction For £76.09. However, the SPM denied reversing the transaction.



91. Other than my correspondence with Helen Rose on the Lepton Spot Review



    involvement in the creation of the Helen Rose report. I am not aware of who

    Helen shared it with, or what POL's response was to the report at the time.



92. Looking at the background correspondence that the Inquiry have provided me

    with, document FUJ00229801 is an email chain in January 2013 with

    correspondence initially between Gareth Jenkins (Fujitsu IT engineer) and

    Helen Rose and then between Gareth Jenkins and myself. It concerns me

    requesting Gareth Jenkins to carry out a formal investigation into the Fujitsu

    transaction log for Lepton 191320.




    2013. Here, Helen is raising concerns about the transaction log for Lepton

    about information in ARQ not being visible in Credence. She is also raising

    concerns that "the recovery session is showing as a normal existing reversal

    rather than a system recovery reversal". I have not been provided with, and

    cannot recall, my response. After this length of time, I cannot recall who I

    discussed the detail of this with. However, in trying to establish what had

    happened in this situation, I do remember discussing the issue with Ron



    process. However, I cannot remember the exact detail of those discussions.

94. Document POL00134139 is an email from Helen to me on 13 February 2013,

    forwarding email correspondence between her and Gareth Jenkins flagging

    concerns that Horizon system based corrections and adjustment transactions

    are not clear on either Credence or ARC logs, as shown with the Lepton logs.

    I cannot recall my response and have requested a copy of my response to

    Helen's email but POL could not locate this which indicates that I did not reply

    to Helen via email. I may have had a conversation with her to discuss the

    email but, given the passage of time, I cannot remember.



95. 1 did not share the report with, or brief others in senior management, Board

    members, SPMs or MPs on the report. I cannot recall when I first became

    aware of the report. I have asked POL for a copy of the covering email from

    Helen Rose to recipients of the report but they are unable to locate this email.

    I seem to remember that it was brought to my attention by the Legal team as

    they were preparing for the Group Litigation Order.



96. The Inquiry have asked to what extent, if at all, did the matters concerning

    ARQ raised in the Helen Rose emails and / or the Helen Rose Report made

    me or anyone else at POL concerned that past convictions may be unsafe.

    Whilst I cannot speak for anyone else, personally I did not make any

    connection to the safety of past convictions from the emails from Helen Rose

    or the Helen Rose Report. Whilst I realise that this sounds naive,

    prosecutions were outside of my area of responsibility and indeed my

    knowledge scope. I took no view on how they were put together, other than to

    be assured that they were done in line with the Crown Code for Prosecutors,

    with oversight of both internal and external lawyers. Here, the focus was on

    the case in front of me. I wasn't aware of any practical procedures around

    disclosure and whilst I do not know if Helen discussed her findings with

    anyone else within POL, my assumption would have been that she would

    discuss anything important with her line manager and ultimately the Head of

    Security and Investigations.




97. The below deals with the nature and extent of my involvement with: a. POL's

    preparation for and response to Second Sight's reports; and b. the Scheme

    and the Working Group established to monitor the Scheme ("the Working

    Group").

    background. As can be seen in their presentation slides at POL00113791,

    they had good technical and stakeholder credentials. However, as time went

    by, we found their output to be very slow and minimal. They were engaged in

    around June/July 2012 to investigate 47 cases and by the time we received

    the interim report a year later (POL00099063), only 4 of these cases had

    been investigated and the investigations into these still weren't concluded.

    Progress felt very slow and disorganised, and POL was getting frustrated as

    we had MPs and JFSA criticising us for the length of time being taken for

    cases to progress. In response to this frustration, the Scheme was created, in


                                   Page 54 of 132
                                                                                     W ITN09900100
                                                                                    WITNO9900100




    an attempt to try and focus on getting a quicker output for SPMs (please see

    below for further details on the Scheme).



101. Paragraph 4 of POL00298004 states that there are two concerns around

    Second Sight: the first that they do not have the capacity to deal with all of the

    cases within an acceptable timetable and the second is in relation to their

    approach of "seeking to reconcile the conflicting evidence and views of the

    Post Office and sub-masters..." Given that this was a Board update, these

    were clearly concerns held within POL, although I am unable to remember

    who specifically held these views. In respect of the first point, as noted above,

    I was concerned about the lack of progress by Second Sight in producing the

    Spot Reviews. I cannot recall any detail in respect of the second point but I

    believe that the concern was that Second Sight was not concluding their

    investigation reviews as quickly as they should have been and this was

    perhaps due to them spending too much time going back and forth between

    the applicants and POL.



102. The Scheme was set up in August 2013 following this note. As such, Second

    Sight's focus changed from reviewing the cases put forward by MPs and

    JFSA, to those who applied to the Scheme (although I believe that many of

    the SPMs in the original cases for review subsequently became applicants to

    the Scheme). Consequently, Second Sight's initial Terms of Reference were, I

    believe, superseded by the Scheme Terms of Reference as agreed by the

    Working Group.

103. POL's strategy in preparing responses to applications and / or Second Sights

    Report was as follows:



       a. Preparing responses to Scheme Applications. On receipt of the

           Case Questionnaire Report (CQC) from the applicant to the Scheme,

           the CQC was assigned to a Mediation Case Review Advisor/Handler to

           investigate the issues raised by the applicant. The Case Review

           Advisor/Handler would then produce the Post Office Investigation

           Report ("POIR") with their findings. This was reviewed by the Mediation

           Case Review Manager and then passed to me for further review, which

           included ensuring the issues raised had been fully investigation, a full

           explanation of the findings set out in the report (with supporting

           evidence) and easy to understand language (rather than technical

           jargon). The final review step was with POL's Legal team. Once

           internal review checks were complete, the POIR and supporting

           evidence was passed to Second Sight for them to undertake their

           independent review of the issues raised by the applicant and produce

           the Case Review Report.

        b. Preparing responses to Second Sight Reports. I believe that this

           was a coordinated effort across POL with the Project Sparrow team

           holding the pen on the drafting of the responses, with others (the Legal

           team, the Communications team and myself for Scheme cases and

           operational matters) feeding into, reviewing and providing comments

           on the content of the responses.

                                                                                    WITNO9900100




104. In terms of POL's approach to disclosing documentation to Second Sight, for

    the Scheme cases, the approach was that the POIR (along with supporting

    documents), was disclosed as a pack to Second Sight. For those cases with a

    criminal conviction, the legally privileged material that POL would not make

    available to the defendant or Court would not be provided to Second Sight. I

    understood this to be in keeping with the standard practice for prosecutors.

    This approach was agreed by the Working Group. For any other

    documentation, requests from Second Sight were referred to the Project

    Sparrow team for consideration and coordination.




105. To enable the timely provision of information from Fujitsu, a project manager

    was assigned from within Fujitsu to facilitate the requests from POL. This was

    in the main, the provision of ARQ data and from memory, it worked well. If the

    Case Review Advisors/Mediation team had any queries on that data or

    required further information, I believe that the Fujitsu project manager

    facilitated the responses to those requests. Pete Newsome was the

    Relationship/Account Manager for the POL account and I believe that some

    requests/queries were progressed by him.




106. I was not involved in the review of past convictions obtained in reliance on

    data generated by Horizon. This was done by the Legal team.




107. I was aware that Second Sight had raised concerns in respect of POL's

    suspense account and that POL may have unexplained profits caused by

                                   Page 57 of 132

                                                                                 WITNO9900100




    SPMs settling illusory discrepancies. Al Cameron (Chief Financial Officer) was

    identified as the appropriate POL person (along with Rod Ismay) to have

    discussions with Second Sight. However, I was not involved in this

    investigation.




108. Within the email chain at POL00061368 I say to Andrew Parsons that the

    disclosure of officers' reports "needs to be addressed on a case by case basis

    as you suggest but with a presumption against disclosure". Here I was

    agreeing with his earlier advice and playing it back to him. The Inquiry have

    asked in what circumstances I thought the presumption against disclosure

    should be displaced — if the relevant information had not been provided in

    other documents then my view was that in some cases the officer's report

    should be disclosed as per my thoughts in respect of M054 (POL00061368)



109. Document POL00022296 is a meeting note from 9 January 2015. The

    purpose of this meeting was to discuss the responses that POL had provided

    to the 97 questions posed by Second Sight on 9 December 2014, with a view

    to enabling them to progress their Part Two Report.



110. 1 recall that POL was providing a huge amount of information (perhaps tens of

    thousands of documents) to Second Sight during their period of engagement.

    I remember that there were some ongoing discussions and disagreements

    about the provision of information in relation to: Suspense Accounts (the

    request was deemed too wide); Bracknell emails (I think this was genuinely a

    misunderstanding of dates although I was not involved in the provision of this


                                  Page 58 of 132

                                                                                  WITN09900100




      information or discussions around it); and legally privileged documents (POL

      had provided the same documentation it would to the defence in a

      prosecution case). This was agreed to be the appropriate approach (i.e. in line

      with standard procedure) at the October 2014 WG meeting.



 111 .The Branch Support Programme was a response to the issues raised (i.e.

      training and support could have been better) by Second Sight in their interim

      report.



The Scheme and -Working Group

 112.As noted above, the Scheme was born out of the fact there were ongoing

     concerns about Horizon potentially being the cause of losses, and Second

     Sight's lack of progress in producing outputs and conclusions from their Spot

      Reviews.




 113. Working Group was formally put in place slightly after the Scheme launched,

     to have independent oversight over the Scheme. The Working Group

     designed the format of the Scheme, such as setting out the application

      process and the approach to be adopted by POL Case Review

     Advisors/Investigators. The approach was to investigate each issue raised by

     the applicant and produce a POIR detailing the findings of that investigation

     with the supporting evidence. This report was then passed to Second Sight for

     them to undertake their investigative review, produce their report and make

     their recommendation to the Working Group on whether the case was suitable

     for mediation. POL would then also provide their view on the suitability of the

                                   Page 59 of 132

    case for mediation and, if deemed suitable, the Project team liaised with the

    applicant, POL and a mediator.




114. My role within the Scheme and the Working Group was to, on behalf of POL,

    lead the team of Case Review Advisors/Investigators who would be carrying

    out the investigation and drafting the POIR. I had a North and South team

    (with 10 case review advisors/investigators in each), each led by a manager

    with extensive Post Office operational experience. The managers sent each

    draft case POIR for my review and my review involved ensuring that each of

    the issues raised had been investigated, their findings explained (in an easy

    to understand language) and that the findings were supported by evidence.

    My involvement in the Scheme was prompted by my involvement in the

    Ferndown interview, but I wanted to take on this role as I had a genuine

    desire to understand if there was any substance in these complaints. I saw

    this as an opportunity to investigate the cases properly and reconcile the

    disconnect between POL and SPMs.




115.As a member of the Working Group I was involved in drawing up the Working

    Group's Terms of Reference and its scope. However, I cannot recall any

    detail around this.




116. In terms of direct involvement with the mediations, they were allocated among

    the senior team according to availability and experience. From memory, I

                                                                                 WITN09900100




    dealt with 3 mediation cases, although my memory around these is limited

    other than to recall that one settled, two did riot.




117.As a member of the Working Group, my role in attending its meetings was to

    provide an update on the progress of the Scheme cases and any issues and!

    or recommendations in relation to individual cases. I also provided information

    on / answers raised by the Working Group in relation to the POL operation,

    policies and procedures. Where I did not know the answer first-hand, I took

    the action to find out and report back. I also participated in the Working Group

    discussions where my experience, knowledge and skill sets enabled me to.



118.The Working Group became more structured and focused on the progress of

    the individual cases as time went on. In my view, all parties were committed to

    a thorough investigation and making the process as simple as possible for the

    applicants. However, there were periodic frustrations within the Group as to

    the time they were taking, compounded by the ongoing expectations of MPs,

    Applicants (and their advisors), JFSA and POL. Discussions at the meetings

    could be challenging however in my view, the Working Group process did, in

    the main, work relatively well .



119. From memory, any briefings on the Scheme were led by the General Counsel

    and/or the Project Sparrow team. Whilst I do not recall any specific briefings

    from memory, I would have provided Scheme cases information i.e. progress

    of the cases through the Scheme and anything that senior management

    needed to be aware of, such as the death of Martin Griffiths.

                                                                                  WITNO9900100




120. In document POL00107151 Alan Bates criticises the Scheme stating "JFSA is

    now of the opinion that the Scheme has strayed so far from the original

    purpose for which it was intended, that the few Applicants who have actually

    reached a mediation meeting through CEDR have expressed disappointment

    with the Scheme, that at least one Applicant has withdrawn. " From reviewing

    this letter and subsequent discussions at the next Working Group meeting, his

    view was that the role of Working Group was not in line with that of JFSA's

    and indeed, what had been agreed in the Working Terms of Reference. I

    disagree with Alan's view that POL had become more "entrenched and

    defensive" as the Scheme progressed "and the original concept of actually

    seeking the truth has long since been abandoned, replaced by denial and a

    culture of blaming the Applicant time after time." I genuinely wanted to get to

    the truth and to find out what had caused the issues for the applicants of the

    Scheme, and I invested a huge amount of time and effort in a full and

    thorough investigation into the issues raised, as far as the evidence enabled

    us to. The findings detailed in the POIR were the outputs of those

    investigations. Our approach in the mediations was also a genuine desire for

    both parties to have a better understanding of each other's position and

    hopefully move closer to closure for the applicant.



121. In terms of the extent that I was involved in POL's internal communication

    regarding challenges to the Horizon IT system, I would usually have been

    asked to comment on draft communications regarding content and tone. I do

    not believe that I saw a policy document, however from memory the approach


                                  Page 62 of 132
                                                                                       W ITN09900100
                                                                                   WITNO9900100




    was to keep the communications factual, proportionate and focused on key

    points/messages.




122. In the email at POL00303871 I state `please ignore the comment from SS that

    POL's investigations are inadequate — this was Ron having a pop in an

    attempt to cover his lack of output." Whilst I can't recall the discussions that

    took place, from the minutes of the Working Group meeting on 17 April 2014

    at POL00026652, I can see that Second Sight were behind on their agreed

    timeline for a number of cases. The POL team of case review

    advisors/investigators led by Kathryn Alexander (South team) and Shirley

    Hailstones (North team) had been working incredibly hard to conclude their

    POIRs to the agreed timeline whilst ensuring a thorough investigation into the

    issues raised by the applicant. I probably made this comment as I did not

    want Ron's comments to demoralise the team.




123.At the time, I did not have any concerns that either myself, or others

    responding to applications to the Scheme, were not receiving accurate andior

    complete information regarding BEDS, remote access or the integrity of

    Horizon as I believed that we had all of the relevant information from Fujitsu

    that enabled us to undertake a thorough investigation of each case.



124. The Inquiry have asked why I think that POL's investigation of allegations

    made by SPMs in the Scheme did not identify new BEDS that caused

    discrepancies in branch accounts, a lack of integrity in Horizon or the extent of

    remote access. I cannot answer other than to say that the information that the

                                   Page 63 of 132
                                                                                       W ITN09900100
                                                                                   WITNO9900100




    investigators received did not evidence or point to any of these issues. In the

    older cases that were reviewed, due to the passage of time, the information

    that would have pointed to these issues was not available.



125. The Inquiry have asked for my views on the reasons or motives for SPMs

    making applications to the Scheme and i or campaigning in respect of

    Horizon. Whilst every SPM had their own reason and motive, my experience

    was that many SPMs felt that they had unresolved issues that they wanted

    closure on, whilst others had issues that they did not understand and were

    looking for explanations. Some SPMs had suffered significant losses and felt

    that they deserved compensation and saw the mediation as the route to

    achieving this. For those that campaigned, they did so in my view as they felt

    that they had not been listened to or received satisfactory redress from POL.



126. 1 have reviewed document POL00109809. In general, I did not think SPMs

    who campaigned and/or spoke to journalists did so to avoid settling debts to

    POL for which they thought that they were liable, however, in this particular

    instance, as I said in the email, I did believe this to be the case. Seeing this

    SPM on the Panorama show was particularly disappointing as we had been

    working with him over a period of time to get to the bottom of what was

    causing the losses in his branch. In this case, there was evidence that the

    losses were caused by SPM error.

Project Sparrow



 127. From memory, as the Terms of Reference have not been disclosed, the

      purpose of Project Sparrow was to oversee the running of the Mediation

      scheme by effectively creating structure and making sure that the Working

      Group got what they needed. For example, providing secretariat support,

      providing updates to POL Board, coordinating messaging on remote access

      and setting up meetings in relation to suspense accounts. The project was

      headed up by Belinda Crowe and worked closely with the Communications

      team. I was not a member, but I occasionally sat in on meetings



 128. 1 do not recall being advised of the rationale as to why the Project Sparrow

      committee became a formal subcommittee of the Board.



 129. I do not recall any specific policies or strategies being discussed/formulated in

      response to complaints made about the Horizon IT System, other than the

      Scheme approach as agreed with the Working Group and those implemented

      by the Branch Support Programme.



 130. With the Post Office investigations completed into all the Scheme

      applications, POL took the decision to put forward the mediation of the

      remaining cases (other than those subject to a previous Court ruling). This

      decision removed the need for the Working Group to determine whether a

      case was suitable for mediation. Consequently, the Working Group was no

      longer required. The rationale is set out in my speaking note POL00151569.

                                                                                    WITN09900100




131. 1 had no involvement in the decision to close the Working Group. However, I

    did ring Alan Bates to advise him of that decision ahead of him receiving

    written confirmation.



132. The Inquiry have asked to what extent, if at all, do I think that the Scheme

    fulfilled POL's intended purpose. As I recall, the Scheme was established as a

    mechanism for applicants to set out their Horizon related (and other) issues

    for POL to investigate and provide a POUR and offer mediation where suitable.

    Where not suitable, the applicant was offered a direct discussion about the

    investigation findings. Therefore, in my view, the Scheme did in the main, fulfil

    its intended purpose. That said, I felt some disappointment that despite our

    best efforts, a number of applicants were not satisfied with the mediation

     process and/or the outcome of the mediation meeting with POL.



133. Project Zebra is not something I remember so I do not believe that I was

    involved in, or aware, of it.




134. The report from Second Sight and the Scheme raised key issues with the way

    things were being run and the Branch Support Programme was created to

    address these issues.



135. The programme was implemented through normal project management

     principles, with the establishment of a governance structure, including a

                                    Page 66 of 132
                                                                                    W ITNO9900100

    Programme Board and a project plan with key milestones and deliverables.

    The project plan has not been disclosed. However, I can recall that one of the

    core values was to stand in the SPM shoes. I felt that i had to work really hard

    to get people to understand the day-to-day job of an SPM and how difficult it

    could be for a SPM to get everything running properly. The art of a good SPM

    was making that look easy. In addition to the issues identified through Second

    Sight and the Scheme, I took the opportunity to see what other improvements

    we could make as an organisation through the programme. These

    improvements are set out in POL Board Report updated 20 February 2014 at

    POL00027454.



136. 1 led the Branch Support Programme as Programme Director from August

    2013 — March 2015 with Gayle Peacock being accountable for running the

    Programme on an operational level.



137. The Terms of Reference v.2 and v.3 disclosed (POL00002194 and

    POL00148920), detail the purpose of the Branch Support Programme as

    being "to understand the current business purposes, operational procedures

    and ways of working which are in place to support branches, identify gaps and

    produce recommendations to rectify the issues." I should flag that I am not

    sure whether this was the final Terms of Reference as the final version has

    not been disclosed. However, either way, I recall that the Terms of Reference

    was later reworded to reflect the extended scope of the programme as

    detailed in the POL Board update February 2014 on the Branch Support

    Programme (POL00002194): "The purpose of the Branch Support


                                  Page 67 of 132
                                                                                      W ITNO9900100
                                                                                    WITN09900100




    Programme is to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the support we

    provide to our sub postmasters and operators in the running of their Post

    Offices from an operational and engagement perspective." Th is is the purpose

    statement that I recognise and that aligns with my understanding of the

    Branch Support Programme at the time.



138. The programme had the backing of Paula Venneils to get changes made

    quickly and because of that, I felt that it was really effective as things could be

    acted upon fast without the usual bureaucracy for approval. For example, I

    recall that there was an issue that if a customer paid for foreign currency on a

    card, the usual process was that the SPM had to print an additional receipt

    and record the last 4 digits of the customer's card on that second receipt.

    Should fraudulent activity be discovered on the card, the SPM would need to

    produce that receipt or else be held liable for the funds. SPMs had been held

    liable for this before and so my view was for something that important, the

    system should automatically generate the second receipt with the necessary

    information. I therefore took steps through the programme to get this change

    put in place.



139.Another issue that came to the programme was with a MoneyGram scam.

    Individuals rang branches, saying that they were engineers and asking a SPM

    to do a test transaction. The individual on the phone would talk the SPM

    through the transaction and effectively steal the money via the MoneyGram

    transfer of money process. POL had clear instructions that MoneyGram

    transactions could only be done when the customer is in front of them so that


                                   Page 68 of 132
                                                                                       W ITN09900100
                                                                                   WITNO9900100




     they can take ID and the money. Therefore if an SPM fell victim to the scam,

     they would be held liable for not following the correct process. I seem to

     remember that one branch fell for the scam over 9 times, becoming liable for

     around £40k. To try to prevent this happening again, through the programme

     we put in place, a message notification would pop up at the beginning of the

     transaction saying 'we will never ask you to do a test transaction over the

     phone.'



Branch User Forum



 140. Paula Vennells asked me to set up the Branch User Forum as a mechanism

     for the voice of the SPM to be heard by senior managers at the heart of the

     organisation. It was an opportunity to bring them inside the organisation in a

     way that we had never done before.



 141.This purpose and objectives of the forum are set out in the Post Office Branch

     User Forum Terms of Reference document dated 18.10.2013

     (POL00196510):



            "Purpose

            The purpose of the Branch User Forum is to provide a way for sub-

            postmasters and others to raise issues and insights around business

            processes, training and support directly feeding into the organisation's

            thinking at the highest level. The forum is a forward looking mechanism

           to ensure the business processes and approaches are fit for purpose

           for users and are in keeping with Post Office behaviours and values. "




       a. To assess issues raised from with the Post Office network; identify

           appropriate solutions and recommend improvements to rectify the root

           cause and prevent recurrence of the issue_

       b. To assess issues raised from Post Office support/central functions;

           identify appropriate solutions and recommend improvements to rectify

           the root cause and prevent recurrence of the issue.

        c_ To input into the design of the end to end process for new products and

           services before launch to the Post Office Network.

        d. To assess improvement suggestions from the Post Office network and

           support/central function i.e. `would this work?"



142. In terms of membership, ! put out a memo to the network saying that we

    wanted to give SPMs an opportunity to feed into the thinking of POL at the

    highest level and asked them to apply with a paragraph to tell me why they

    should be selected. I remember that I wanted full representation with SPMs

    from branches of all shapes and sizes, from smaller traditional post offices to

    large city post offices. I then brought in a number of senior people within POL

    to represent different functions, for example Network, IT and Commercial .

    The Subgroup members were also senior managers who took responsibility



    User Forum meetings. Depending on the issue/topic they may have attended

    some of the Branch User Meetings to provide an overview of their respective

    function/work area and/or update on any actions they had responsibility for.



143. The forum was very much positioned as a confidential , safe place to have a

    conversation with 'Chatham House Rules' applying, which was really

    important to the functioning of the forum. From memory, there were around 6

    SPMs and 6 POL representatives, with me chairing. I remember that we also

    had a federation representative and a union representative but both were on

    the basis that they were wearing their SPM hat whilst in the forum. I didn't

    want to shy away from any conversation.



144.As Chair, it was my duty to give SPMs their voice and making sure that the

    business understood what they were saying and equally, to make sure the

    SPMs understood the implications of the actions they wanted. There were

    some very challenging conversations but some really successful results and it

    was something that I was very passionate about. At times the forum was

    about educating and at other times it was about making changes. There was

    a session on Second Sight and the Branch Support Programme so there were

    some conversations around the Horizon system but the main focus of the

    forum was looking forward and making improvements. I remember that we

    took the forum to Chesterfield so that they could see how FSC worked and

    Paula Vennells attended another meeting so questions could be put to her.



145. 1 also wanted to use the forum as a test bed for new products so if POL was

    proposing a change it would come to the forum first so SPMs could share


                                  Page 71 of 132

    their feedback. I felt that this was invaluable as we were taking out the niggles

    in processes and preventing errors upfront.



146. 1 requested copies of the agenda and minutes for the Branch User Forum

    meetings that I chaired. POL has provided the dates of 22 meetings held

    during the period that I was Chair, from November 2013 — January 2017

    inclusive, and have provided agendas with minutes for approximately half of

    those. From these, the range of discussion areas can be seen to cover

    predominately (especially in the earlier meetings) feedback on issues with

    some products (e.g. Drop & Go); communications to branches via Memoview

    and Branch Focus; improvements to processes on Horizon (e.g. cheque rem

    out, Bureau second receipt).




147.The last meeting I attended was January 2017. I handed the Chair role over at

    this meeting to Mark Ellis the Network Operations Director. Unfortunately I

    received anecdotal feedback from a couple of the SPMs that the forum lost its

    momentum and impact as senior manager support and attendance dwindled

    at the sessions. I'm not aware if the Branch User Forum is still in place today.




148. In terms of the nature and content of any briefings that I gave to those working

    on the Branch Support Programme or the Branch User Forum in relation to

    Second Sight's Interim Report or the Helen Rose report, my recollection is as

    follows:




                                   Page 72 of 132
                                                                                      W ITN09900100
                                                                                     WITNO9900100




        a. Branch Support Programme — a key focus of the programme was the

           key issues raised by Second Sight in their Interim Report (July 2013)

           and the themes of the Scheme. Whilst I can't recall exactly whether the

            Interim Report was shared in its entirety (although I would normally

           have done this and so my working assumption is that I did), the key

           issues would certainly have been briefed to the Branch Support

            Programme Board and the core Branch Support Programme team for

           the same subsequent improvements to support and processes to be

           made. I do not believe that I shared the Helen Rose report with the

           Branch Support Programme members.

        b. Branch User Forum — I cannot remember whether I provided the

           Second Sight Interim Report or the Helen Rose report to the Branch

            User Forum. However, POL00294615 is a slide deck about the Branch

           Support Programme (dated 17 July 2014), which was established to

           review the lifecycle of the SPMs` experience with Post Office; to "fix"

           the issues identified in the Second Sight report and the subsequent

           mediation cases and to ensure that any lessons learnt are factored into

           future ways of working.




149. The below deals with my recollection of the death of Mr Martin Griffiths.



150. In answering the Inquiry's questions, I have reviewed the following

    documents:




                                   Page 73 of 132
                                                                            W ITN09900100
                                                                           WITNO9900100




a. POLO0027757 — This was the email chain of October 2013, notifying

   up the line the tragic news that Martin Griffiths had passed away.

b. POL00027757 - email to Andrew Parsons on 1 September 2014.

   Please note that the Inquiry have provided the same reference in

   respect of the above document.

c. POL00306234 — This is an email from Lauren Griffiths to me on 2

   September 2014, expressing her disgust at the treatment of POL to her

   family following the death of her father and asking me to escalate the

   matter. My response to Lauren and the internal emails leading up to

   that is at POL001 16698. l say how sorry I am that she feels that her

   and her family have been let down by the POL and for what they have

   been through, as well as outlining the steps that POL have taken to

   support them. In a letter of 5 September 2014 I offer a discretionary

   payment of £140,452 to Gina Griffiths, Martin's wife, which is

   equivalent to the sum offered to SPMs who chose to leave POL as part

   of the Network Transformation ("NT") programme, for which Martin was

   not formally eligible for as he had been served 3 months' notice of

   contract termination by POL.

d. POL00306171 — This is an email from me to Andrew Parsons on 4

   September 2014. POL00306172 is the attachment to the email . These

   emails are about putting in writing the NT payment equivalent offer to

   Gina in respect of Martin's prior request to exit POL via NT programme.

   This was following the meeting I had with Gina Griffiths and her brother

   in Chester on 1st September 2014.

                                                                                      WITNO9900100




        e. POLO0219796 — This is an email from Rodric Williams to me on 22

           January 2015, sharing a copy of the Settlement Agreement with Gina

           and asking us to confirm a few points around the intention of the

           agreement.



151. 1 also requested and received additional disclosure in respect of this case,

    which is listed in the annex below.



152. In terms of my involvement in POL's response to the tragic news that Mr

    Griffiths had taken his own life, to the best of my recollection I believe that

    Kevin Gilliand (Director of Network and Sales) rang Gina Griffiths, Martin's

    wife, to offer his condolences and I think that he suggested to her that I would

    be in touch to offer whatever support I could. After making initial contact with

    Gina (by telephone I believe) I became the contact within POL for Gina. As

    stated in my response to her daughter, Lauren Griffiths (POL00116698), I

    tried to assist operationally and financially by arranging for a temporary SPM

    to run the Post Office branch, agreeing the rental amount to help with the

    overheads of the business and making an exceptional payment to Gina in

    October 2013.



153. 1 met with Gina and Martin Griffith's mother in November 2013 at their request

    at a local pub (a few weeks after his death) to discuss their preference for the

    future of his Post Office branch. I then met with Lauren in London (November

    2013) to answer whatever questions she had at the time. I later met with Gina

    and her brother in September 2014 in the lounge area of a hotel and


                                   Page 75 of 132
                                                                                       W ITNO9900100
                                                                                   WITNO9900100




    discussed exceptionally progressing the NT exit payment that Martin had

    previously expressed an interest in but for which he wasn't formally eligible. I

    also recall having telephone conversations with Gina over this period as well.

    The further disclosure shows a degree of regular contact between myself,

    Gina and Lauren Griffiths.




154. My involvement in POL's decision making in relation to offering Gina Griffiths

    a discretionary payment was as follows: Martin Griffiths had previously

    expressed an interest in leaving the Post Office with a NT payment. The

    payment was a 'loss of office' payment made to SPMs where their existing

    post office could be transferred to a new SPM. However, when Martin was

    given 3 months' notice to terminate his contract, he was no longer eligible for

    the NT payment. I made a case to the business that, in light of the exceptional

    and tragic situation, we should exceptionally include Hope Farm Road Post

    Office in the NT Programme and facilitate the transfer of this Post Office to a

    new SPM, therefore triggering the NT payment to Gina Griffiths. The business

    agreed, however the payment was to be made within the NT Scheme rules in

    terms of the approach to a settlement agreement as laid out in the letter at

    POL00306172.




155. Document POL00027757 contains an email dated 11 October 2013 from

    Paula Vennells to myself, with others copied in and states the following: "...we

    need to look at the business: to help me brief this properly to the Board, can

    you let me know what background we have on Martin and how/why this might

    have happened. I had heard but have yet to see a formal report, that there

                                                                                   WITNO9900100




    were previous mental health issues and potential family issues     " The Inquiry

    have asked what response I gave to this request and whether I conducted

    investigatory work to aim to respond to this request. I can see in the email

    chain that on the same day, Kevin Gilliland has advised Paula that I was to

    pull together a brief. From the further disclosure 7th March 2024 1 can see that

    I did liaise with Glenn Chester to provide a brief to Paula on the relevant

    information on Martin Griffiths' case.




156.The below sets out my involvement with responding to David Hill's

    correspondence regarding the Horizon IT System and any investigation into

    his concerns. In answering the Inquiry's questions on this subject matter, I

    have reviewed the following documents:


       a. POL00116957 (email chain between 10 December 2014 and 2

           January 2015). This contains the original email from David Hill, giving

           details of an overpayment he received after depositing a cheque and

           subsequent correspondence within POL about how to respond.


       b. P L00101966 (email chain between Tom Wechsler and me on 2

           January 2015). This contains a re-draft of my proposed response to

           David Hill. Whilst I can't remember the discussion I had with Tom, I can

           see that the final paragraph has been amended from the first draft as in

           POL00116957, with the outcome appearing that I wanted to investigate

           the issue further, rather than send a response which assumes the error

           is due to a manual inputting error.

                                                                                        W ITNO9900100
                                                                                   WITNO9900100




        c, POL00116960 (my letter to David Hill on 2 January 2015). This is the

           final letter that was sent to David Hill, based on the drafts in the email

           correspondence. In the letter I apologise for the error and

           inconvenience and request further information so that I can investigate

           what had happened.


        d. POL00102078 (email from David Hill to me on 28 January 2015). Mr

           Hill declines my request for further information. I do not remember

           these emails/letters and cannot recall if any further action was taken.


        C. POL00319590 (email exchange between Melanie Corfield and Mark

           Underwood). This is an email from David Hill with Mel's suggested

           response. I am not a recipient of the email .




157. 1 do not remember dealing with this before the letters were provided to me by

    the Inquiry and therefore cannot recall if any further action was taken in

    respect of them. Looking at my request to Mr Hill for details about the

    transaction, I obviously wanted to investigate this further to establish what had

    happened. The working assumption appeared to be that the transaction had

    been correctly processed in the branch and it was in the processing centre

    where they entered the deposit value and payment value, that the error had

    occurred. This is what I wanted to investigate, but wouldn't have been able to

    without the details of the transaction requested from Mr Hill, which he declined

    to provide.

                                                                                      WITNO9900100




158.As noted above, I did not remember this correspondence prior to it being

     provided to me by the Inquiry and cannot remember exactly what I thought at

    the time. However, as this transaction was not done during the time of the

    suspended SPM and was thought to be a processing centre error rather than

    a branch error, I probably would not have considered this relevant to any

    criminal convictions.




159. In addressing the Inquiry's questions on this topic, I can confirm that I have

     reviewed the following documents:




          copied to me, on 14 June 2015);

     d. POL00317725 (entry for a meeting on 24 June 2015);




    f.    POL00152439 (email from Mark Davies on 25 June 2015);

          2015) and POL00318511 (attachment);

          copied to me, on 5 August 2015);

    j.    POL00319556 (email from Mark Davies to me on 20 August 2015). Mark

          is asking me to review his letter of complaint to the BBC and

          POL00319557 (attachment). I don't recall this letter, however if l did

          review it there should be a response from me but this has not been

          disclosed.

     k. POL00029912 (email from Mark Underwood to me on 21 August 2015);

     I.   POL00139183 (email chain between Melanie Corfield and me on 21

          August 2015); and

     m. POL00091401 (email from Rodric Williams to me on 22 August 2015).




160. I cannot recall the exact detail as to the extent to which I was involved in

     POL's response to concerns raised by SPMs, MPs and journalists about the

     Horizon IT system. However, I have detailed below a general overview of my

     involvement, to the best of my recollection.



161. In respect of concerns raised by SPMs, from 2012 onwards, I would have

     normally been the person to engage with SPMS, for example investigating

     issues raised as part of the Scheme, dealing with Business As Usual' queries

    (those raised outside the Scheme and after the Scheme had closed) and

    dealing with general queries within POL that related to SPMs. Where

    concerns related to remote access issues, POL had pre-approved wording for

    what we were to say. For example, see POL00022659 and POL00022665

    which confirms the approved wording as at July 2016.




                                    Page 80 of 132
                                                                                         W ITNO9900100
                                                                                    WITNO9900100




162. Following the closure of the Scheme, I embedded the investigation approach

    that we had developed for the Scheme into business as usual via the Support

    Services Resolution Team. This is the team that I would refer any issues from

    SPMs to in relation to discrepancies in branch. Depending on the issues

     raised and/or if the branch was high profile and there was MP or journalist

     involvement, I may have engaged directly with the SPM or I may have left it to

    the Support Service Resolution Manager to do so.




163. In respect of concerns raised by MPs, responses to MPs were usually

    coordinated through the Communications team (including the Executive

    Correspondence Team) and/or the Project Sparrow team whilst it existed. As

     noted above, I met with MPs on 10 May 2012 and 18 June 2012.. prior to the

    closure of the Working Group. Whilst I recall that I did also meet with some

    other MPs and their SPM constituent at their request to discuss particular

     issues/concerns, I do not remember the dates or precise details. However,

    typically the discussions were around Horizon or contract termination.




164. In respect of concerns raised by journalists, I can recall that I was part of the

     meeting with journalists on 9 June 2015 in respect of the BBC Panorama.

     Prior to seeing the transcript, I did not recall the content of this meeting

    (POL00140211). I do not feel able to add anything beyond what is contained

     in the transcript. I do not recall attending any other meetings with journalists

     between March 2015 and April 2016. Nor do I recall being involved in any

    other responses to journalists during this time, but without access to my

    calendar, I am unable to be absolutely certain. As noted above, it was the

                                    Page 81 of 132

                                                                                                              WITNO9900100




    responsibility of the Communications team to respond to journalists and if they

    required any information from me, I would respond to their request.




165. 1 never did any briefings to the POL Board and I or senior managers on the

    integrity of the Horizon IT System. It was, however, usual for me to do

    briefings/provide updates on the Branch Support Programme and the

    improvements made as part of this programme. This programme ended in

    March 2015 and later briefings that I delivered would have been on the

    outputs of the Business Improvement Programme/Support Services

    Transformation programme, again relating to improvements linked to the

    issues raised in the Scheme.




166. Whilst I have seen that there was a meeting on 24 June 2014 (POL00317725)

    at which the Communications Director, Mark Davies, was due to brief us on

    media questions in respect of the Horizon system, due to the passage of time,

    I cannot remember what was said during this meeting.




167. In document POL00029912, there is an email from me to Mark Underwood

    (21 August 2015) asking for POL's                                       to what Richard Rolls said
                                                                                                         on

    knowledge) what he was actually saying and the associated implications so

    that I was able to discuss it as part of the mediation. It was very typical for us

    to request IT's input on technical issues when dealing with a mediation as we

    did not have the requisite knowledge.




168. 1 did not consider making contact with Richard Rolls and I am not aware of

    any others at POL making any consideration to interview or make contact with

    Richard Rolls.




169. The below deals with the nature and extent of my involvement with POL's

    instruction of Sir Jonathan Swift and its response to his review. The Swift

    Review is provided at POL00006355 and is "a review on behalf of the

    Chairman of POL concerning the steps taken in response to various

    complaints made by SPMs" dated 8 February 2016. At the outset I should say

    that I was not involved in POL's instruction of Sir Jonathan Swift and I do not

    recall seeing a response from POL to his review. I did, however, meet with Sir

    Jonathan Swift to provide information for his review.



170. 1 have reviewed the following documents in relation to The Swift Review:

        b. POL00153578 (Kendra Dickinson's email to me on 11 November

           2015). This is an email request for information from NBSC via me and

           Kendra for the Chairman's review;

        c. POL00153691 (Kendra Dickinson's email to Steve Allchorn, copied to

           me, on 19 November 2015). This is an email from Kendra, providing

           updated information to the original request from NBSC;



           on 20 November 2015). Although i was copied into this email chain,

           these were legal points that I did not participate in; and

        e. POL00323294 (Mark Underwood's email to me and others on 16

           December 2015). This is an email from Mark requesting information

           following a meeting with Jonathan Swift and Christopher Knight in

           relation to the Chairman's review.



171. I was aware of the compilation of the Chairman's Review/Report (as it was

    referred to within POL at the time) and I did act as a conduit for gathering

    information for the NBSC. However, I don't recall receiving a copy to read or a

    briefing on the contents whilst at POL. I can recall that at some point I was

    told (and this is paraphrasing), that everything is fine with the Chairman's

    Report and we can continue as we are.



172. In August 2023, I became aware that the report was in the public domain in

    redacted format and at that point, I downloaded a copy to read. This was the

    first time that I read it. On reading the report, I remember thinking that the

    suggested approach of a top down approach to the Scheme investigations in

    addition to the bottom up approach that we had adopted was something that I

    wished we had implemented as it would have been a more complete

    approach and would have enabled more conclusive findings.




173. 1 have been asked to consider document POL00153527 which is an email

    from Melanie Corfield me and others on 10 November 2015. Whilst this

    document does not reference the `Dalmellington Bug' specifically, my

    knowledge of the detail of this 'bug' is limited due to the passage of time and I

    have therefore assumed that 'the issue' referenced in the email is the

    Dalmellington bug. I believe that this was a bug that impacted Outreaches

    only (an outreach is not a Post Office in its own right but is attached to a `core'

    Post Office and treated as one Post Office branch for the purpose of branch

    accounts). The issue occurred when the Core Post Office was remming

    (transferring /remitting money) money out to the Outreach. I think that they

    were able to press the button again and transfer of money doubled up. I don't

    recall what POL's response was at the time.

175. The below deals with my role and responsibilities in relation to the group

    litigation and the nature and extent of my involvement in POL's work and

    decision-making process in that case.



176. 1 was not involved with and cannot recall any specifics around POL's general

    litigation strategy. From memory (and without seeing anything disclosed

    around this), my understanding was that any strategy was ultimately a Board

    decision following a recommendation from POL's Group Executive/Legal.



177. I can recall that I sat in on a number of meetings at the early stage as Jane

    MacLeod (General Counsel and Company Secretary) would keep me in the



    been previously.




178. The Postmaster Litigation Steering Group ('PLSG'), of which I was a member,

    was established with a `Business As Usual' focus as set out in the Terms of

Reference (POL00025509), which had been agreed by the Post Office Group

Executive as set out below:




       "Terms of Reference. The objectives of the PLSG are to ensure that

       Post Office's defence of the Claim:



   •   does not place unplanned constraints or resource burdens on Post



   •   is consistent with business as usual (BAU) practices, processes and

       procedures.



       In order to deliver these objectives, the Post Office Group Executive

       has agreed that PLSG will undertake the following responsibilities:



          a. providing a forum for cross-business discussion of Claim-related

             BAU issues so that all relevant matters are considered when

                i1III,lk.i11E1L.JIJI

             activity, and monitoring the resources required to deliver

             against that plan;

          d. signing of key Claim-related documents;

          e. monitoring and approving Claim-related expenditure;

                   f.    reviewing, challenging and signing of any Communications

                        plans developed as a consequence of the Claim',

                   g_ reporting matters to the Group Executive as appropriate."



179. In terms of general litigation, my team (those previously involved in the

      Scheme investigations) were investigating the lead cases and making sure

      that the Legal team had the right information. I was heavily involved in

      conversations with Womble Bond Dickinson from an operational standpoint as

      they would use me a sounding board to ask questions and explain to Counsel

      how things worked on the ground'. My role was very much as a provider of

      facts, rather than any decision-making.

181. I do not recall being part of either the decision-making process for disclosure

      of documents or the decision making process for lay and expert advice. This

      was led by the Legal team.




182. It was not within my responsibilities to keep the Board or Government

      informed of any of the above matters.




183. My understanding was that ultimately the POL Board — or the sub-Board if

      they had delegated authority to do so — took all of the strategic decisions in

    relation to the group litigation. I recall that Womble Bond Dickinson would

    often product an 'Option Report' with a recommendation when required, off

    the back of conversations with POL lawyers. I cannot recall any time when

    POL Board did not go with the recommendation.



184. I do not know and therefore cannot comment on how POL satisfied itself that

    the substantive position it took in letters and Court documents were correct.

    However, on a personal level both for the legal arguments and the technical

    position, I took at face value the advice and technical explanations as

    provided by the Legal team, Fujitsu and Deloitte. I had no reason to doubt

    what experts in this field were telling me.



185. Whilst the draft/proposed letter of response was shared with the PLSG, my

    involvement in drafting it was limited. This was very much a legally crafted

    response.



186. My involvement in POL's position on remote access was limited to being

    briefed on the approved wording/messaging from those with the technical

    expertise as referenced in the email chain (POL00025167) i.e. Rob Houghton,

    POL's CIO, Fujitsu and Deloitte.




187. The below deals with my involvement with / oversight of the drafting of POL's

    Generic Defence and Counterclaim. At the outset, I should say that this

    responsibility primarily lay with the Legal team and my involvement was




188. 1 can confirm that I have reviewed the following:




           (decision paper on counterclaims and recommendation from Bond

            Dickinson to bring counterclaim for outstanding losses).



        b. POL00003340 (letter from Bond Dickinson to Freeths dated 18 July

           2017 enclosing POL's Generic Defence and Counterclaim).



189. Whilst I cannot recall exactly what happened at the time, the usual approach

    taken was that each section of the Generic Defence and Counterclaim had

    input from the respective business owner/subject matter expert and/or verified

    by them as being accurate. For example, Branch Trading Statements and

    making good and disputing shortfalls fell within the FSC area of responsibility

    and so they would verify the section relating to these issues. It was the Legal




190. 1 have reviewed paragraphs 43(1) to (3) of the Defence (PL00003340). At

     paragraph 4(3) it states "The blocked value is not (and is not treated as) a

    debt due to Post Office." Whilst I can't remember exactly, the usual approach

    was that FSC would verify that this was correct.

191. Paragraph 48(3)(b) of the Defence states that it is denied that Fujitsu edited

    or deleted specific items of transaction data"_ As above, i cannot recall having

    a specific discussion about the Defence, however I believe the approach

    would have been to seek input from the business expert/subject matter expert

    and/or have them verify that the wording was accurate. In this instance, the

    expert was Fujitsu with the oversight/assurance also sought from Rob

    Houghton, POL's CIO and Deloitte as referenced in POL00024801 and

    POL00025167.




192. Paragraph 57(4) of the Defence states "To have abused those rights so as to

    alter branch transaction data and conceal that this has happened would be an

    extraordinarily difficult thing to do, involving complex steps. which would

    require months of planning and an exceptional level of technical expertise.

    Post Office has never consented to the use of privilege user rights to alter

    branch data and, to the best of its information and belief, these rights have

    never been used for this purpose." Whilst I am unable to answer from memory

    the basis on which POL pleaded this, my understanding is that the same

    approach would have been adopted in that POL would have requested

    input/assurance from Fujitsu in the first instance and then possibly requested

    an assessment from Rob Houghton and/or Deloitte of the statement from

    Fujitsu.




193. 1 do not recall from memory why POL decided to bring counterclaims against

    the SPMs in the group litigation, however having read POL00024653, it was

    recommended by Womble Bond Dickinson that "Post Office should bring a

    Generic Counterclaim for the outstanding shortfalls only_ "

           been disclosed whether I received a copy of this report and on

           reviewing this version, I don't recall ever having read it before.




        c. POLO0006764 (minutes of the Postmaster Litigation Subcommittee of




195.Although I was not involved in the oversight of the conduct of the litigation, my

    understanding is that there were three layers of oversight: the POL Board, the

    Post Office Litigation Subcommittee and the Post Office Group executive. As

    described in POL00006764. the Post Office Litigation Subcommittee was

    established to receive advice relating to Postmaster Litigation. However, as I

    was not involved in any oversight, I am unable to add anything beyond what is

    contained in the documents.



196. 1 do not recall receiving a copy of the Bramble report and I do not remember

    hearing the Deloitte work referred to as Bramble'. However, I do remember

    being aware that Deloitte had been engaged to do some work as set out in

       and any associated discussions at the PLSG meetings of which I cannot recall

       any specific detail.



  197.As part of the litigation preparation, I was asked to do a Risk Assessment of

       the Common Issues, that looked at the likelihood of losing a Common Issue

       planning (Deloitte supported with this) to mitigate the impact of an adverse

       judgment on the Post Office operation - this was referred to as our Response

       Plan'. I prepared briefings for each of these activities.

       f.   POL00003363 (Womble Bond Dickinson's letter of 28 November

            2018). This letter pushes back on Freeths claims of late disclosure of

            PEAKs.



199. From memory, my knowledge of the Known Error Log (`KEL') and the

    PinIGL/PEAK database was limited to the extent of that which was shared at

    the PLSG meetings. I had never heard of them until we got into the Group

    Litigation Order ('GLO') process. Fujitsu only disclosed ARQ data for the

    Scheme and so this terminology had never come up before and was not part

    of what I did on a daily basis. I was cross-examined extensively on them and

    whilst it might seem remarkable that I had not seen them before, I genuinely

    had not. I do not feel that I am able to add anything substantive beyond what

    is contained in the trial transcripts.



200.Although I was in attendance in the PLSG meetings when

    KELs/PinIGLs/PEAK were discussed, my involvement was limited and I had

    no involvement with disclosure. From my perspective, disclosure was a

    requirement of the GLO and managed by the Legal team as they had the

    experience of, and expertise in, disclosure. The discussions that I can recall

    on disclosure were pretty much 'lawyer to lawyer'.

201. I do not know the basis on which POL pleaded paragraph 50(4) of the

     Defence. I do not recall any discussions on this, although I presume that

     Fujitsu provided this information to POL.




202. My recollection is that decisions on redacting documents were taken by the

    witnesses to help them draft their witness statements.




204. 1 do not recall specifically how the Post Office's case on the effect of the

    "settle centrally" button was prepared, but as set out above, the general

    approach adopted when answering specific issues was to seek input from the

     business area owner/subject matter expert and/or request that they verify the

    wording for accuracy. in this case, for 'settle centrally' button, this was FSC

    and so I assume that they were heavily involved.




205. 1 was not involved in the decision-making for the approach to the cross-

    examination of claimants. If I recall correctly, this was a Legal team decision

    with, I expect, the approval of POL Board.

207. I have been asked to explain the background and purpose to creating a formal

    subcommittee of the POL Board to deal with the group litigation. I do not recall

    ever being briefed on the reasoning. I was not a member of this

    subcommittee.



208. The Terms of Reference for the subcommittee have not been disclosed but

    POL00006764 states "it was noted that at the meeting of the Post Office

    Limited Board on 29 January 2018, the Board established a committee to

    receive advice relating to the Postmaster litigation. The Company Secretary

    tabled draft terms of reference for the Committee which were noted and

    approved for recommendation to the Board at the next Board meeting on 27

    March 2018. It was explained that day-to-day decisions on the litigation were

    taken by the executive but that the Board was consulted in advance of any

    significant decisions being taken."Similarly, POL00024270 states `A

    subcommittee of the Post Office Limited Board is established to receive legal

    advice on the Post Office's Defence in the Group Litigation as it proceeds to

    final resolution_ "As i was not involved, I do not feel that I am able to expand

    on anything beyond what is contained in the documents.



209. 1 do not recall having any discussions with POL senior managers or directors,

    or representatives of UKGI or government, on litigation strategy following

    Fraser J's comments on POL's approach in his decision on the application to

    strike out aspects of the claimant's witness evidence.



2.10. As a witness, I understood that my role was to assist the Court/judge by

    providing factual evidence to the best of my knowledge, by way of the witness

    statement and also through oral evidence. I undertook °familiarisation training'

    where it was drummed into us that witnesses could not be coached and that

    we were there to assist the judge and to go in and tell the truth in the most



    not change throughout the course of the GLO.



211. 1 was, however, highly criticised by Justice Fraser at the Common Issues trial

    who stated `'there are two particular matters in which I find that she [me] did

    not give me frank evidence, and sought to obfuscate matters, and mislead

    me..."This was not my intention and I deeply regret inadvertently giving him

    cause to form that view.

212.As to the process of taking and drafting my witness statement, I remember

    that I had a meeting with a couple of the Wornble Bond Dickinson lawyers and

    I talked through my roles and experience in POL over the 33 years that I had

    been with POL. I believe that they asked me questions about a number of

    points and the meeting lasted several hours. From this discussion, they

    drafted an initial document that went through several iterations before I signed

    the final version.



213.As I recall, Melanie Corfield (Communication Team) and Kathryn Alexander

    (Support Services Resolution at the time, previously Mediation Case Review

    Manager) kindly helped me by locating the documents that I wanted to read to

    refresh my memory and to ensure that I had the correct dates and appropriate

    wording. Melanie Corfield provided the source links for the documents in the

    footnotes.



214. 1 have reviewed each paragraph of my Common Issues final statement signed

    24 August 2018 and can confirm that, for the most part, this was derived from

    my own knowledge at the time (although I no longer have this level of

    knowledge), some of which will have been drawn from documents that I had

    read over the years. I have referenced some sources in the footnotes within

    my statement:



       a. My own knowledge: 5-18 inclusive; 20-27 inc; 29-94 inc; 96-105 inc;

           112-145 inc.

        b. Documents I read: for the ones I've referenced in the footnotes,

            Melanie Corfield provided the source links for these for me

        c. Information from others: 28; 95; 106 -111 inc.



215. 1 do not feel that the lawyers at any point influenced what I said or told me

    what to say in my witness statement. However, they did guide me on the

    areas/topics to cover.



216. 1 do not recall now why paragraphs 139 and 140 of my draft statement

    (POL00253924) were removed and from the documents disclosed to me,

    there is nothing that gives me any insight into the reason for this. I vaguely

     remember broad discussions about putting more emphasis on certain things

    or keeping things more brief but there was no conscious decision from me to

     put POL in a good light and I cannot recall details beyond a general memory

    of these sorts of discussions. It was a very long process, which I was doing

    alongside my day job.




    include in my witness statement. Beyond this, I cannot recall why I did not

    describe the detail of the settle centrally button and its consequences in my

    witness statement.



218. 1 do not recall considering what was helpful or unhelpful content to POL when

     I was drafting my statement. POL is a complex organisation and in drafting my

    witness statement for the Common Issues Trial I was trying to set out POL's

                                                                                    WITN09900100




    background, the environment it operated in and how it operated on a day to

    day basis, in a factual (as to what I believed to be correct at the time) and as

    straightforward way as I could. The Legal team guided me on the areas/topics

    to cover and I followed their guidance.




219. 1 was criticised by Justice Fraser in his judgement (Alan Bates and Others v

    Post Office Limited [2019] EQHC 606 (QB)) for having left out certain details,

    and for having stated at the time that my reasoning for leaving out certain

    detail was because I thought that the statement was already too lengthy. To

    be clear, I was not told that the length of my witness statement had to be a

    certain length but I do recall general discussions about trimming it back and

    what to keep in and take out. I distinctly recall that when cross-examined, I

    said that I thought Horizon was "clunky" and I was criticised for not having

    said this in my statement. I remember being surprised as I thought that I had

    but when I went back and reviewed my statement, I realised that I had

    forgotten that this reference was removed in one of the draft amendments.

    Please see paragraph 115 of draft statement POL002 53924 where I have

    said "the biggest weakness in Horizon is that it is a bit `clunky" to use." For the

    avoidance of doubt, it is my view that the Horizon system was clunky. I wholly

    accept that I signed that statement and only I am responsible for anything that

    was or was not in that statement. I was guided by legal advice and it was an

    error to have removed references such as this.



220. The witness familiarisation sessions were designed to give witnesses an

    insight into the Court process and what to expect on the day. As I remember,


                                  Page 103 of 132
                                                                                        W ITNO9900100
                                                                                   WITN09900100




      the overriding message from the session was that as a witness, you are there

      to provide factual, honest information to the judge to assist him in his

      understanding of how POL operated/operates and the matters to which we

      were providing witness statements on. Whilst it did not change my approach

      to my evidence (as our evidence was not discussed in the sessions), it helped

      me to be better prepared for my Court appearance.



 221.As noted above, the areas that I covered in my witness statement were

      guided by the Legal team. I did not feel pressured by this approach, I found it

      helpful as I was not experienced in the Court legal process and without their

      guidance I would not have known what areas to have covered in my

      statement.



 222. The first I heard of the recusal application was when Fraser J returned from

      recess during the live trial and announced that he had received a recusal

      application from the Post Office. I remember having to ask my lawyer what

      recusal meant and finding the whole situation embarrassing.



Horizon issues


 223. In preparing for the Horizon issues trial, I can confirm the following:




             documents. This was done by the Legal team.


         b. My involvement in the preparation of witness evidence was only in

             relation to my own witness statement.

           involved in these discussions and so I am unable to answer to what

           extent they provided assistance in preparing the case.




224. 1 can confirm that I have reviewed the following documents:

     email with anyone at the time. While Andy was making us

     (Rodric Williams and me) aware of the 'off process' approach

     that Robert Worden was taking, he says in this email that there

     is nothing POL or the Legal team can do (other than

     acknowledge the risk) as this is his expert witness evidence.

                   Whilst I was aware of Robert Warden's work, I had not been

225. My role in relation to the training of witnesses for the Horizon issues trial was

    to act as a conduit between Womble Bond Dickinson (who had arranged the

    witness familiarisation training with Bond Solomon) and the POL employees

    who had been identified as witnesses for the GLO trials. Being a witness in a

     High Court trial was not a routine part of their role and potentially a daunting

    experience. My role was to oversee the witness familiarisation training, to

    ensure that the witnesses felt as comfortable and prepared as they could be.

     Following the experience of the Common Issues and Horizon Trials, I drafted

    the Witness Support Framework' (this document has not been disclosed)

    setting out my recommended approach for POL to adopt as minimum support

    for any future witnesses required to give evidence.



226. I do not remember when I was asked to be a witness, however I understand

    that I was asked because the timeline of the GLO meant that it spanned 20

    years. I had been in the Post Office for 33 years by this point and I was the

     most senior individual who had good operational experience as well as

     knowledge of the investigations because of the Mediation Scheme.

     Importantly, POL was approaching the GLO by looking at in--branch

    transactions and operational evidence and that was where I had the most

     knowledge. However, Patrick Green KC for 'Alan Bates and Others'

    approached the case from a `remote access' and `bugs' issue for which I did

     not have the requisite knowledge. I think that there was a genuine blind spot

    in POL that Horizon was the issue, which meant that IT were not as involved

    as I now, with the benefit of hindsight, believe they should have been. Instead

    this was looked at from an operational point of view.



227. I cannot recall the exact process by which my witness statement was drafted

    in the Horizon issues trial, but as previously, I was guided by the Legal team

    as to what areas to include in my statement. Much of the content of this

    statement was responding to certain claims made by Lead Claimants in their

    Common Issues witness statements; responding to certain claims by Mr

    Coyne, the Claimant's IT expert, and responding to Mr Henderson's analysis.

    For the SPM evidence, the issues raised/claims made were investigated by

    my team of investigators, with a report produced of their findings. Having

    reviewed these reports, I then used that content in my witness statement.

    Having reflected on the types of questions that were put to me during cross-

    examination, I think that my witness statement tried to cover too many areas

    as my role as a witness should have been limited to operational matters, with

    the Chief Information Officer being brought in to speak to technical IT matters.




228. At 208 of Justice Fraser's judgment (Alan Bates and Others v Post Office

    Limited) [2019] EWHC 3408 (QB), he states the following:



           "she [Angela] also explained that in relation to Mrs Burke "I have

           looked at other evidence in relation to Mrs Burke and what was very

           clear to me is that Mrs Burke had done absolutely nothing wrong in that

           situation" This is not at all how Mrs Burke had been cross-examined.

                                 Page 108 of 132
                                                                                       W ITNO9900100
                                                                                     WITN09900100




             Mrs VDB said that the corrects she had made to her statement had

             been communicated to the PO solicitor's before the Horizon Issues trial

             had started. If this is true, I do not see how counsel for the PO would

             have cross-examined her on the basis of her un-corrected statement."



229. 1 was deeply upset by this as I had been constantly ringing Jonny Gribben

    (senior lawyer) prior to the Court case telling him that I needed to change my

    statement because further evidence had come up that showed what had

    happened behind the scenes and that Mrs Burke had done a transaction but it

    had disappeared in branch. In parallel, Fujitsu had picked up on the issue but

    POL had not been made aware. I knew this weeks before we got to Court and

    I got in touch with my legal team to tell them this. I was really disappointed

    that it had not been picked up and I have requested further disclosure from

    the Inquiry for any correspondence with the legal team around this date. I

    have expanded on this below in respect of the Inquiry's questions around this

    point.



230. The Inquiry have asked about why I sought to make changes to my statement

    after it was signed and served and in particular, why the proposed

    amendments of paragraph 110 of my second witness statement

    (POL00000679) were not included in the list of amendments (POL00000688).

    I first sought to make changes to my statement in mid-February as can be

    seen by the correspondence between Womble Bond Dickinson lawyers and

    myself in POL00111660. This is an email chain between Katie Simmons and

    me on 13 and 14 February 2019. The email is in respect of Angela Burke and

                                                                                   WITNO9900100




    me requesting to amend information in my witness statement more than a

    week before the trial.



231. POL00111877 (my amended Second Witness Statement, disclosed by the

    Inquiry 7 March 2024) shows tracked changes to paragraph 110 that were not

    reflected in the list of amendments (POL00000688). I don't know why that

    was the case as the other changes (with the exception of a minor change to

    add c before £9000 at para 127) tracked in this version of my statement have

    been included in the list of amendments.



232. The Inquiry have asked me to explain the background and purpose of my

    email at POL001 55095. I am unable to answer this question fully as I cannot

    recall from memory and have asked for further disclosure in respect of this

    question but not received any. At the time, I obviously felt strongly enough

    about this issue to put it in an email to Ben. I seem to recall that other Group

    members were mentioning to me that they felt the PLSG was not operating as

    it had been previously in that it seemed that decisions were being taken by

    Board/Board sub-group without any input from them and therefore they were

    concerned about the potential impact of those decisions on their areas. I think

    this is what prompted my email to Ben.




233. With the settlement being reached on the GLO in December 2019, my role

    came to an end. As a result, I was made redundant.

234. Based on my knowledge at the time, my view is that POL responded

    appropriately by appointing Second Sight, setting up the Scheme and making

    every effort to fully investigate the issues put forward by SPMs.



235. However, having seen what has come out of the Inquiry and having had the

    opportunity to take a step back and evaluate things with the benefit of

    hindsight, my biggest regret is that we did not get an external IT expert, such

    as Deloitte (or another appropriately qualified organisation), to do a deep dive

    into the Horizon system to assess whether what the claimants were claiming

    was possible and if so, whether there was any evidence of their claims

    happening. The idea that Fujitsu could be going into branch accounts, altering

    figures and generating losses in those accounts seemed so fictitious that I do

    not think anyone in POL properly contemplated it as a possibility. I think this is

    why POL approached the cases from an operational and not a technical point

    of view.



236. In my view, Fujitsu were being insufficiently transparent about the bugs in the

    system meaning that even people of my seniority were not aware of the full

    extent of them. Whilst making recommendations to POL during 2018/2019 I

    suggested that POL established a portal for SPMs to access so that they

    could see the characteristics of known bugs. Should a discrepancy arise, they

    would be able to go to the portal to see whether the problem at their branch

    was likely to have been caused by a bug. I wanted a more open way of

                                                                                      W ITNO9900100
                                                                                  WITN09900100




    working to help SPMs identify and address the cause of any losses they may

    have.



237. 1 felt that the intentions of those I worked with were genuine and they wanted

    to get under the skin of whether there was any substance to these claims,

    including myself. However, on reflection I do think that at some point during

    the GLO preparation/trials there became less emphasis on addressing SPM's

    issues, by making improvements to policies, procedures and ways of

    workings, and the focus from a legal perspective, shifted to a more defensive

    approach. I do not think that my approach changed throughout (and if it did

    that wasn't my intention) as I continued to use the process to identify issues

    and make recommendations to the business on policy and process

    improvements. I recall presenting a slide deck at a senior meeting (I can't

    remember the forum but General Executive members were in the room) on

    my reflections on the GLO and subsequent recommendations quite soon after

    the Common Issues trial (probably in December 2018).



238. In respect of POL's approach to prosecutions, I do not feel able to comment

    as I had no experience in this area and a limited knowledge of what was

    involved. However, I was assured by the business that the strict process they

    followed adhered with the Crown Code of Prosecutors. Similarly, I do not feel

    able to comment on POL's conduct of the GLO proceedings as I was not

    involved in the decisions on how POL should engage in the process. I

    believed at the time that the process being followed by the lawyers was the

    norm and in keeping with how those processes typically worked.

239.Although the Inquiry has not asked me to review Human Impact Statements, I

    felt it important to respond to two where I am referenced.



240. In respect of the Human Impact Statement of Jennifer O'Dell:



           a. Page 26 line 16: ... "she became extremely intimidating, extremely

               bullying towards me, demanding that I...I sign a piece of paper that I

               had stolen the money and if! didn't they were going to take my

               home away"




241. I suggest that Mrs O'Dell is mistaken in her recollection. I have never, and

    would never, behave in such a way. This was a mediation meeting and there

    were five of us in the room - Mrs O'Dell and her representative from Howe &

    Co, POL's legal representative, the independent mediator from CEDR and

    myself. If I had behaved as Mrs O'Dell claims and said what she said I did (all

    of which I strongly deny) the other parties in the room would have said

    something and/or challenged such behaviour. They did not, as what Mrs

    O'Dell alleges did not happen.




242. In respect of Chirag Sidhpura oral evidence 17th March 2022, page 43, line 13


            "Angela Van Den Bogerd was appointed to conduct an independent

           review of my case but because the trend was already set by Paul

                                                                                     WITNO9900100




                South/n. she could not go back and change that, even if she wanted to,

                as this was months before the GLO was to start"




      fresh investigation into the issues that led to his suspension and contract

         termination. However, on the findings of that investigation and the content of

         his interview with me, the evidence was such that I was unable to reinstate Mr

         Sidhpura. My decision was based on the facts of my review, the pending GLO

         had no bearing on my decision. I have previously reinstated other SPMs

         where that decision was justified.




 244. There are no further matters that I consider are of relevance to the Inquiry that

         I would like to draw to the attention of the Chair.
                 •




I believe the content of this statement to be true.
