Subject: Panorama

Simon, James.

As you will know Panorama is planning a programme on the Post Office and the Horizon computer system on August 17. We have
issued a very strong rebuttal and statement.

I understand that Fujitsu has issued a short line to the programme and I understand why. But as you will know the programme plans
to feature a whistleblower who will make allegations which we are unsighted on except in broad terms.

I wanted to get a sense from you as to how you plan to respond: will you put someone up to deal with media generated off the back of
a Panorama? I am concerned that however far fetched the allegations they could be regarded as "new" and a detailed rebuttal will be
necessary.

Can you let me know your thoughts? We might also look to have a call today or next week?

Best wishes
Mark
