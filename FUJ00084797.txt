Hi Gareth

Some additions made.

Is it possible that other branches were impacted but their balances not affected? For example if a branch operated with one stock
unit which declared and cleared a discrepancy and subsequently deleted the stock unit within the requisite timeframe would equal

and opposite values still have impacted the branch in the next two years — albeit with no cash impact?

Simon,
Here it is so far.

It may be worth passing it on to Andy Winn to see if he can fill in any of the gaps from an FSC perspective.

Regards

Simon,

You asked on Friday for a more detailed worked example for Lesley. I've attempted to do this, but it is missing a few key dates and detail as I
don't have the underlying logs yet. I have asked for them to be retrieved, but that will take a few days.

Do you want what I have so far or would you rather wait until I can add in the detail from the logs at the end of the week?

lam concerned that this paper is getting very long (estimate around 6 pages) and technical rather than being a simple management summary
as you originally requested.

Regards

Gareth
