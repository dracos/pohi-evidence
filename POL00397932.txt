1 Introduction

1.1 Document Description and Function

This document defines an Operational Level Agreement (OLA) between Post Office Ltd and Fujitsu
Services. It gives an overview of the processes used to order and deliver the OBC - Branch service,
which governs physical change within the Post Office branches; it details agreed targets for
performance against those processes, and the methods used to review and assess that performance.

1.2 Document Contractual Status

The OBC - Branch service is not directly subject to any Service Level Agreement (SLA). This OLA
does not supersede or override any existing Service Level Agreements between Post Office Ltd and
Fujitsu Services, or any contractual agreements between Fujitsu Services and external OBC - Branch
service suppliers, and is therefore a non-contractual joint working document.

1.3 Document Change

This document should be subjected to regular joint reviews by Post Office Ltd and Fujitsu Services.
It should be reviewed at least annually, and following any major change to the OBC - Branch
processes.

2 Scope and Purpose

Planned physical changes to the Post Office Ltd estate that involve Horizon Online equipment
configuration and movement are managed within the OBC Branch Service jointly by Fujitsu Services
and Post Office Ltd, supported by sub-contractors to each party. SVM/SDM/STD/0001 (Fujitsu
Services/Post Office Ltd Operational Business Change — Branch, Interface Agreement) defines the customer
and supplier responsibilities necessary to support the delivery of the OBC Branch Service.

In general, Fujitsu Services manages:-

. the supply of refurbished Horizon Online equipment

. the provision of data communications network

. amendments to the Horizon Online System central infrastructure

. the configuration/commissioning of Horizon Online equipment within branches

. the physical and technical access to the hardware whilst stored with a sub-contractor

before allocation to a scheduled install activity
Post Office Ltd manages:-

. the carriage of new Horizon Online equipment to branches and recovery of redundant
Horizon Online equipment from branches which are closing

. any survey, preparation, electrical installation and LAN works necessary to support the
Horizon Online installation

. the layout of Horizon Online equipment within branches to agreed ergonomic standards

However, there are certain types of OBC — Branch planned change where these responsibilities are
altered. These include ‘Event’ Offices, Unplanned Closures, and changes to BRANCH CODE codes;
in each of these cases some or all of the Post Office Ltd responsibilities listed above are undertaken
by Fujitsu Services on behalf of Post Office Ltd.

This OLA defines the normal delivery of OBC Branch Service, supported by the associated
documents in section 0.4. The supporting documentation details the description of each service
offered, the price charged from Fujitsu Services to Post Office Ltd for the supply of the Fujitsu
Services elements of those services, the interface between the businesses for the ordering of those
services, and the description of a compliant counter. This document details the roles and
responsibilities of each party, communications processes, service targets, performance measures,
and processes that have been deployed and are continuing to be deployed to support the effective
delivery of the OBC Branch service.

2.1 Objectives
The Objectives of this OLA are:

. To clarify the respective roles and responsibilities of all relevant groups involved in
delivering the OBC - Branch services across the organisation boundaries.

. To facilitate the development of comprehensive and consistent working level procedures
for the consistent and improved delivery of OBC - Branch services.

. To set and agree service performance targets

. To detail the methods by which the service performance targets will be monitored and
reported

. To document the processes by which the OBC - Branch service is deployed effectively.

3 Contractual Obligations

The following documents state the contractual obligations between Fujitsu Services and Post Office
Ltd for the Operational Business Change — Branch Service: -

. Fujitsu Services/Post Office Ltd Operational Business Change — Branch, Interface
Agreement [SVM/SDM/STD/0001]

. Operational Business Change — Branch, Service Descriptions and Schedule of Service
Prices [SVM/SDM/SD/0014]

. The Agreement between Fujitsu Services and Post Office Ltd dated 31% August 2006 as
amended, in particular by CCN1200 [on 31/08/06']

. Requirements for Compliance/Audit Standards ISO 27001 and possible audits from
FSA/CNI/PCI

3.1. Assumptions

This OLA is based on the assumption that the services referred to are defined in the contractual
documents listed in Section 3.0. It is a requirement of this OLA that the contractual obligations are
understood and adhered to by Fujitsu Services and Post Office Ltd

It is also assumed that Post Office Ltd will request new variants of OBC Branch Services in the
future, and that Fujitsu Services may wish to offer new OBC Branch Services to Post Office Ltd. The
requirement for new OBC Branch services will be determined by Post Office Ltd and developed by
Fujitsu Services on request from the originator. Any such change to the services provided will be
implemented via the “soft change” process; this process requires the amendment
of.SVM/SDM/SD/0014 OBC Branch Service Description, and SVM/SDM/STD/0001 OBC Branch
Interface Agreement.

Fujitsu Services will also review the OBC Branch documents annually in order to comply with the
OSI/BSI requirement and to incorporate changes such as changes in document references, services
provided or the processes supporting their delivery, or agreed service price revisions.

4 Service Description

Post Office Ltd has an ongoing requirement for physical changes to their branch network; the
Operational Business Change (OBC) service is provided to deliver that change, where amendments
are required to the Horizon Online system and/or its configuration. Post Office Ltd expresses their
requirements through the submission of a form OBC20. This is translated into a set of services
comprising of physical supply and configuration of hardware, software, network and data
components, together with the administration and management tasks necessary for Fujitsu Services
or associated third parties to deliver them to the post office branch. This OLA applies to the delivery
of OBC Branch services described in the Operational Business Change — Branch, Service
Descriptions and Schedule of Service Prices document SVM/SDM/SD/0014.

The information supplied on the OBC20 request by Post Office Ltd must be clear and unambiguous,
and the service must be requested with due notice as defined in the Branch Interface Agreement
(SVM/SDM/STD/0001). If the OBC20 request is unclear, ambiguous, or requests a service that is not
covered within the Branch Service Description (SVM/SDM/SD/0014), Fujitsu Services will contact
Post Office Ltd PPCAT and attempt to resolve the query. In the event that the query cannot be
resolved, or the notice period is not observed, Fujitsu Services may reject the OBC20 request.

Exceptionally, Fujitsu Services, for ‘special’ projects would not require an OBC20/21, but it would
need to have all of the details provided in a version controlled spreadsheet. This spreadsheet would
be published and validated on a weekly basis and the integrity of the data would remain the
responsibility of both parties in providing confirming and agreeing the details on a regular basis.

4.1 Service Delivery Hours

OBC Branch Service Delivery hours are detailed fully within the Branch Service Description
(SVM/SDM/SD/0014).

The Fujitsu Services OBC Branch team provide service during the hours of 09:00 to 17:30 Monday to
Thursday, and 09:00 to 17:00 on Fridays. There is an OOH servi ilable for Conversions at the
weekend and a member of the OBC team can be contacted on The Fujitsu Services
Engineer team provide service during the hours of 08:00 to 18:30 Monday to Friday. In both these
cases, all public and bank holidays, as applicable on a regional basis within the United Kingdom are
excluded.

Engineer support for OBC Branch Changes may be provided outside of the hours stated above, by
prior arrangement. When service is provided outside these hours, the “out of hours” or “public
holiday” rates detailed in the Branch Service Description (SVM/SDM/SD/0014) will be chargeable.

British Telecom engineers attend site on behalf of Fujitsu Services for the purpose of installation or
relocation of Branch data communications lines. British Telecom will indicate an appointment to be
“am”, “pm” or “all day”. In this context, “am” represents any time between 08:00 and 13:00, and “pm”
represents any time between 13:00 and 17:00.

In all cases, escalation is available using the escalation matrix, as will be detailed in the latest
version of the Fujitsu Services/Post Office Limited OBC — Branch Interface
Agreement.(SVM/SDM/STD/0001)

4.2 Service Delivery Days

On receipt of the OBC20 request, Fujitsu Services will identify the necessary services required, and
schedule and manage the delivery of those services to the post office branch in support of the
requested target date. Where Post Office Ltd have indicated specific delivery days for individual
service elements, Fujitsu Services guarantee that a Fujitsu engineer will attend site on the OBC
Branch change scheduled date and will inform PPCAT where variance is unavoidable. Fujitsu

FUJITSU FUJITSU RESTRICTED (COMMERCIAL IN
CONFIDENCE)

Services will provide to Post Office Ltd a work schedule showing clearly the dates on which each of
those services will be delivered to the branch within 48 hours of receipt of the OBC20.

4.3 Service Delivery Times

The Fujitsu Services OBC service is designed to operate primarily during the hours of 09:00 to 17:30
Monday to Thursday, and 09:00 to 17:00 on Fridays, as these are the hours supported by the Fujitsu
Services OBC Team. However, the Fujitsu Engineers, the Fujitsu Services SMC and BT engineers’
standard hours of cover extend outside of these hours. Service may also be provided outside of
standard hours of cover by prior arrangement. Further details on hours of cover are contained within
the Branch Service Description (SVM/SDM/SD/0014), and escalation routes at all times are detailed
within the Branch Service Description (SVM/SDM/SD/0014).

From 01/12/04, Fujitsu Services introduced as a service improvement, a guaranteed scheduled OBC
20 Fujitsu Services Engineer appointment service, at no additional cost to Post Office Ltd. The
default attendance time is 09:00, to allow several hours for the downloading of data and the
configuration/commissioning of Horizon Online kit. Exceptionally, Fujitsu will meet specific Fujitsu
Engineer appointment times requested by Post Office Ltd at any time in the day to help Post Office
Ltd deliver the complex area of Branch OBC works in association with numerous other sub-
contractors. However for configuration/ commissioning works, only specific times between 08:00 and
12:00 are considered suitable by Fujitsu Services as beyond this time, there is the risk that the Fujitsu
Engineer will not be able to complete all the work at the branch in the time available and will need to
return the following day. (Note 09:00 - 12:00 for Counter Increases although it's important for
engineers to be on site at 08:00 to be able to do any pre-work required).

Appointments will be kept by dedicated Fujitsu Services Engineers, who will not leave site (for
example for break fix work) until the branch is operational.

From January 2007 Fujitsu Services introduced as a service improvement a guaranteed scheduled
OBC engineering attendance on the “Open to Public” day for all “High Profile” openings and for those
openings where this additional attendance has been specifically requested. This service will be
referred to as the Horizon Online “Go-Live Support Service (GLSS)"

4.4 Service Delivery Duration

Within the Branch Service Description (SVM/SDM/SD/0014) and the Branch Interface Agreement
(SVM/SDM/STD/0001), Fujitsu Services has provided indicative timings for software download and
configuration of Horizon Online equipment. Fujitsu Services will work to complete all activities as
efficiently as possible, taking into account local conditions.

4.5 Service Delivery Volumes

In the interests of delivering branch change as cost effectively to Post Office Ltd as possible, the
Fujitsu Services OBC team has been sized to deliver a consistent rate of change on a regular basis.
It is in the interests of both parties to predict changes to this demand rate and to work together to
smooth out peaks and troughs in demand, in order to ensure that sufficient resource is available to
meet increases in the demand for OBC service delivery, or that resource is not being retained
needlessly.

Furthermore, the Fujitsu Services OBC controller role is a specialised task within Fujitsu Services,
and makes use of a range of bespoke tools and systems that are not deployed elsewhere within the
company; as such, additional staff need extensive training before becoming fully operational. Hence,
both parties will work together to anticipate changes to the demand rate of OBC services.

5 Service Structure for OBC Branch

The service requirements of Post Office Ltd are composed of a set of discrete services, provided by
a combination of Fujitsu Services and other sub-contractors to Post Office Ltd. At a lower level,
Fujitsu Services delivers its own responsibilities by a combination of internal suppliers and external
contractors (primarily BT via Cable & Wireless and Fujitsu Core Services).

This OLA details the relationship between Post Office Ltd and Fujitsu Services for the delivery of
OBC Branch change activities; the diagram below is therefore limited to those activities where there
is an interaction between these two parties.

In this OLA we consider the OBC Branch service to have a life cycle of four phases:

. Requirement Phase — Post Office Ltd is responsible for this phase

. Scheduling Phase — Fujitsu Services and Post Office Ltd are responsible for this phase
. Delivery Phase — Fujitsu Services suppliers are responsible for this phase

. Completion Phase — Fujitsu Services is responsible for this phase

5.1 Requirement Phase — Requesting an OBC Branch
Change

Post Office Ltd must request a business change by submitting an OBC20 request to Fujitsu Services.
The OBC20 request must be completed in full, contain all relevant information, and describe the
change required in a clear and unambiguous way. The date requested for the business change must
conform to the minimum notification period for the type of change requested. Fujitsu Services will
accept or refuse the OBC20 request (see paragraph 5.4 below).

Exceptionally, Fujitsu Services, for ‘special’ projects would not require an OBC20/21, but it would
need to have all of the details provided in a version controlled spreadsheet. This spreadsheet would
be published and validated on a weekly basis and the integrity of the data would remain the
responsibility of both parties in providing confirming and agreeing the details on a regular basis

5.2 Requirement Phase — Changing an Existing OBC
Branch Request

Post Office Ltd may make a change to an existing OBC20 request by submitting an OBC21 request
to Fujitsu Services. The OBC21 must conform to the same standards detailed in section 5.1, as well
as showing clearly the amendment required. If the OBC21 requests a service delivery date that is
earlier than previously stated on the OBC20, Fujitsu Services reserves the right to reject the OBC21
if it presents an unacceptable service risk due to a breach of the minimum notification period for the
type of change requested, but will, nevertheless, continuously work closely and positively with Post
Office Ltd to achieve the target date.

Post Office Ltd Change or Project Managers will monitor branch progress to ensure that OBC20
orders can be delivered on the dates requested. Every effort will be made to keep subsequent
changes to orders to a minimum. Where an OBC21 is necessary, it should be submitted as soon as
the requirement is known.

5.3 Requesting a New OBC Branch Requirement

The OBC Branch services that have been agreed are detailed within the Branch Service Description

appended to the Branch Interface Agreement (SVM/SDM/STD/0001) . This document also details
the processes to be followed in the delivery of those services. One of these services is for an “Ad
Hoc” branch change — that is to say an exceptional requirement for a new service or for a variant on
an existing service.

Where Post Office Ltd require the regular delivery of a new type of Branch Change, or envisage that
usage of an existing type of Branch Change will cease, this can be introduced via the “soft change”
process. That is to say, the amended requirement can be introduced via an update to the Branch
Interface Agreement (SVM/SDM/STD/0001).

5.4 Scheduling Phase — Validating the OBC Branch
Requirement

Fujitsu Services will acknowledge receipt of the OBC20 to Post Office Ltd. The OBC20 will be
validated for conformity and checked for clarity and completeness by Fujitsu Services.

The OBC20 will be checked by Fujitsu Services to ensure that it complies with the requirements in
paragraph 5.1 above. If the OBC20 passes this check, Fujitsu Services will accept the requirement;
where the OBC20 is incomplete, unclear or ambiguous, Fujitsu Services will contact PPCAT to
resolve any query. Where the change requested cannot be delivered; (due to reduced timescales or
other reasons), Fujitsu Services reserve the option to reject the OBC20.

5.5 Scheduling Phase - Scheduling the Service
Components

Following the acceptance of the OBC20 request, Fujitsu Services will translate the change
requirement into the selected service components. A formally approved excel spreadsheet template
will be completed and sent to the appropriate service delivery units and Post Office Ltd PPCAT for
information within 48 hours, these spreadsheets will be version controlled and stored by Fujitsu for
auditing purposes. Post Office Ltd PPCAT will inform the post office branch, and the Post Office Ltd
Change or Project Managers, of the service delivery date(s). It is important to the overall success of
the service that service components are ordered with the mandatory lead-time and delivered in the
correct sequence. It is the responsibility of Post Office Ltd to inform the post office branch of the
activities to be carried out in the branch, and to provide project management to assist the postmaster
or branch manager.

Where appropriate (depending on the Branch Change type), Fujitsu Services will schedule:

eThe provision of packaging material for collection by Post Office Ltd

. The supply of refurbished Horizon Online equipment (as detailed in Document
Reference 2) commensurate with the planned Branch configuration

. The attendance of a BT engineer to install a communications solution, or to reposition an
existing solution (ISDN line, VSAT kit, ADSL service)

. The attendance of a Fujitsu Services Engineer to configure/commission Horizon Online
equipment

The amendments to the Branch system configuration
eThe receipt and checking of Horizon Online equipment returned to Fujitsu Services.

. The disposal of surplus Horizon Online equipment currently in storage, as requested by
Post Office Ltd from time-to-time, at no cost to Post Office Ltd.

Where appropriate (depending on the Branch Change type), Post Office Ltd will schedule:

The attendance of a Post Office Ltd Change or Project Manager, Branch Manager,
Migration officer and any other personnel detailed in the agreed processes

The attendance of a BT engineer and any other works to install a communications
solution, or to reposition an existing solution (PSTN line)

The completion of any other works at the Branch upon which the planned Branch change
is dependant (this would include survey and preparation activities undertaken by Romec
NPG, counter supply and build, and any electrical installation or alteration works
required).

The collection of packaging material or Horizon Online equipment from Fujitsu Services
and its delivery to the Post Office branch

The collection of redundant Horizon Online equipment from branches and its return to
Triage (for Fujitsu Services)

The collection of surplus Horizon Online equipment from branches and its delivery to
Fujitsu Services’ nominated contractor, for the disposal of the Horizon Online equipment
at no cost to Post Office Ltd.

5.6 Scheduling Phase — Re-scheduling the Service
Components

Fujitsu Services recognises that, despite best intentions, circumstances may change which require
Post Office Ltd to amend their original Branch Change requirement. In raising an OBC21 request (as
detailed in section 5.2), Post Office Ltd must ensure that sufficient notice is given to Fujitsu Services
to allow the service delivery to be rescheduled. Post Office Ltd has the responsibility of informing the
affected post office branch of any changes to the service delivery date(s).

5.7 Delivery Phase — Supplying Physical Changes on Site

Physical changes delivered at the post office branch are vulnerable to unpredictable local
circumstances that can be beyond the control of Fujitsu Services or its subcontractors. Fujitsu
Services and their subcontractors will make reasonable endeavours to overcome any problems that
arise on site when delivering service.

Fujitsu Services advises Post Office Ltd not to request a change in service delivery dates after the
point at which service components have begun to be delivered (as shown on the work schedule), due
to the service inter-dependencies. For example, the second site meeting during a Branch Opening
includes placing a sticker to indicate the position for the ISDN terminal; if the second site meeting is
rescheduled, the ISDN location sticker may not be in place when BT visits the site to install the ISDN
line.

5.8 Delivery Phase — Applying System Build Changes

Some OBC Branch requirements depend on complex changes being applied to the Horizon Online
software configuration. This activity is vulnerable to errors if date changes are applied to previously
scheduled dates. BCMS is a complex database, which initiates action to amend system builds to a
pre-determined schedule based on the expected change delivery date. It has been introduced to
automate the system build and to reduce human error by restricting the opportunity for manual
intervention. It is therefore not always possible to intervene manually and amend the BCMS
timescales without extending the service delivery date by the minimum notification period.

Fujitsu Services OBC will work with Post Office Ltd PPCAT to accommodate any late change to
requirements wherever possible, or to advise an alternative approach where necessary.

5.9 Completion Phase - Completing the Requested
Change

This phase is achieved when all of the individual service components comprising the OBC Branch
requirement have been successfully delivered, and the change at the branch is in live operation.
Fujitsu OBC will inform Post Office Ltd on a weekly basis of all completed changes, Branches listed
on this report will be deemed ‘Signed Off as complete. OBC20 requests that have been cancelled
during the scheduling or delivery phases enter the completion phase for assessment of costs incurred
prior to cancellation.

The output from this phase is used to produce a monthly spreadsheet of supporting charge

information for Post Office Ltd to approve. Subsequently, this is used to calculate a quarterly invoice
to Post Office Ltd.

6 Service Management

6.1 Service Management Framework

Fujitsu Services and Post Office Ltd have jointly developed a Service Management Framework to
support the end-to-end Horizon Online service. The framework defines the Service Management
process and disciplines that both Post Office Ltd and Fujitsu Services have agreed.

6.2 Incident Management

Within the OBC Branch service, incidents are defined as day-to-day events that could affect a
satisfactory completion of the service. Fujitsu Services will manage the relationship with its OBC
Branch service suppliers and all OBC Branch service technical incidents; incidents will be recorded
within an OBC Team database. Post Office Ltd will manage the relationship with its other service
suppliers, and all issues with the post office branch; these incidents will be recorded within the Post
Office Ltd PPCAT Issues Management Database on Remedy.

6.2.1 Forced Closure Incidents

Once notified by the NBSC of a Forced Closure incident (please also see Document Reference 2),
Fujitsu Services will, if the Horizon Online equipment is at risk, remove (or replace, as applicable) the
hardware in order to safeguard their asset. This will incur no cost to Post Office Ltd. If the Horizon
Online equipment is reinstalled within 28 calendar days then the hardware will be provided free of
charge. However, beyond this time period the normal OBC charges for the reopen will apply.

6.3 Problem Management

Problems are defined in OBC Branch terms as the underlying cause of one or more incidents with
significant business impact. The Fujitsu Services problem management process will be used to
resolve OBC Branch problems and if appropriate the joint Fujitsu Services and Post Office Ltd cross-
domain problem management process will be invoked. This includes the maintenance of a record of
action in resolution of the problem on a joint database, and regular review at a joint Problem
Management meeting.

OBC Branch related problems will also be reviewed during the regular OBC BORF meeting.

6.4 Relationship Management
Post Office Ltd owns the business relationship with the post office branch and Fujitsu Services.

Post Office Ltd owns the business relationship with BT for the supply of suitable communications
lines for which ADSL communications can be utilised

Fujitsu Services own the business relationship with their internal and external service suppliers. The
external service suppliers include:

° BT, via Cable & Wireless, for providing ISDN lines
. BT, via Fujitsu Core Services for the provision of the ADSL service
. BT, via Fujitsu Core Services, for providing VSAT links
. Triage for the provision of Horizon Online packaging material

. Various suppliers (including Triage) for the logistical supply, repair and refurbishment of

the Horizon Online equipment

6.5 Risk management

On the submission of Change Requests, Post Office Ltd accepts there are certain pre-defined risks
which may influence the outcome of change implementation.

Should any of the pre-defined risks to “Change” manifest then Post Office Ltd accepts the
requirement to submit authorisation for the “Change” to continue. Authorisation to proceed will be
received by Fujitsu OBC in the form of an authorisation e-mail to the Fujitsu OBC Team mailbox.

Assessment of Security risks will be carried out jointly between Post Office Ltd and Fujitsu Services
Security teams.

Risk assessments will be performed periodically by both Post Office Ltd and Fujitsu Services to
assess changes in requirements and in risk situations. These risk assessments will be undertaken in
a methodical manner capable of producing comparable and reproducible results.

Either party may transfer risks to themselves and any associated third parties as deemed
appropriate.

6.6 Service Review Procedures

Post Office Ltd and Fujitsu Services hold a regular OBC Branch Operational Review Forum at which
Post Office Ltd management and Fujitsu Services management meet to discuss the effectiveness of

6.9 Finance Management

Fujitsu Services will levy charges for the delivery of OBC Branch services in accordance with the
Document Reference 2.

Fujitsu Services will provide a monthly spreadsheet showing the OBC Branch activity and charges
associated with each Change order. This spreadsheet will include sufficient detail to enable Post
Office Ltd PPCAT to check the charges indicated. This will act as supporting information for an
invoice for OBC Branch activity. Where queries arise, these will be answered within two weeks.

The spreadsheet will be version controlled and will be checked against the months activity and
approved before being sent to the client.

Invoices for OBC Branch activities will be submitted to Post Office Ltd quarterly, covering the
preceding calendar quarter. The invoice will include sufficient detail to enable Post Office Ltd to
check the sums charged. Invoices are to be payable 30 days from receipt by Post Office Ltd

OBC20 forms are considered firm orders for work. Upon receipt, orders are placed with Fujitsu
Services suppliers, and a number of administration functions performed. Accordingly, if the order is
subsequently cancelled, a charge will be made for this administrative work. Where an OBC21 form
is submitted, Fujitsu Services will make a charge for the administrative work associated with
processing those amended requirements with the exception of some orders deemed to be for
Information only. If an order is cancelled during the service delivery period, Fujitsu Services will seek
to recover from Post Office Ltd any costs that have been incurred prior to cancellation. Typically,
this would encompass:

. Data and System Management charges after Day —-20 (Day -7 for closures)
. ISDN line installation when installed (typically after Day -8)

. Total costs for any cancellations on the target day itself.

. Total costs for VSAT equipment as a result of termination of the project.

Post Office Ltd may request, and Fujitsu Services may meet, reimbursement of reasonable additional
costs (typically staff, travel, and subsistence costs) on a case-by-case basis, in circumstances where
severe operational disruption has been caused solely by a Fujitsu Services service delivery failure.
Such claims are to be submitted to the Fujitsu Services Head of Service Delivery for individual
consideration.

Where Fujitsu Services fail to install the ISDN line on the requested date and this results in the Post
Office not opening to the public on the scheduled date (excluding line plant issues) then Fujitsu
Services will waiver the ISDN installation charge.

Further details on the charging principles associated with OBC Branch may be found in the Branch
Service Description (SVM/SDM/SD/0014)

6.10 Security

The Post Office Account is dependent on computer systems for the majority of its business activities.
A high level of computer security must be maintained to ensure business continuity and minimise
damage by preventing and reducing likelihood of security breaches. Information Security provides
an enabling mechanism for information sharing and ensures the protection of information and
computer assets.

Information assets are valuable and must be protected to ensure that their value is retained. Where
information is held in computer systems, the information technology must also be protected for the
security and integrity of the information to be maintained. An asset of the group includes buildings,
computer hardware and software, communications equipment, personnel, data and documentation.

9 OBC Branch Process for Horizon Online
Installation

The following diagram illustrates the OBC Branch Process followed during Horizon Online
installation.

The OBC Branch Change process starts in the top right box. Each descriptive box includes a code,
for example “a1”. This relates to the workflow table that follows the diagram, where a fuller
description of the process step can be found.

The diagram is arranged in columns, showing the team responsible for delivering the process step,
and in horizontal rows following a chronological timeline from top to bottom. Hence, the diagram
flows from the top row to the bottom row, with the arrows showing the direction of process dependant
on the circumstances affecting the change as it progresses to completion.
