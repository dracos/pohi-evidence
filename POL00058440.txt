Further to my statement of 6° January 2009, I would now like to add the following.

On the 20" May 2009, I made enquiries with Surrey Police Headquarters to see whether there
was any record of Mr or Mrs Misra reporting any incidents to the local police whilst running
West Byfleet Post Office ®. Only one crime related reference number was found and this was
D/067865. I applied to Surrey Police for the full details of this incident and produce this report
as exhibit JL/01. The report was instigated by Javed Bidiwala, an ex-employee of Mr and Mrs
Misra’s. His report alleged that Mr Misra accused him of stealing £2,000 and that Mr Misra

spread these rumours around the community.

On the 9" April 2009, a letter was received from Castle Partnership Solicitors supplying the
names of three previous employees of West Byfleet Post Office ®. I was asked to make the
necessary enquiries in trying to trace these individuals. The following information was
ascertained, ne

I have been employed by Fujitsu Services, Post Office Account, formally ICL Pathway Ltd
since 20 January 2004 as an Information Technology (IT) Security Analyst responsible for audit
data extractions and IT Security. I have working knowledge of the computer system known as
Horizon, which is a computerised accounting system used by Post Office Ltd. I am authorised
by Fujitsu Services to undertake extractions of audit archived data and to obtain information

Signature

regarding system transactions recorded on the Horizon system.

Horizon’s documented procedures stipulate how the Horizon System operates, and while I am
not involved with any of the technical aspects of the Horizon System, these documented

processes allow me to provide a general overview.

At each Post Office there are counter positions that have a computer terminal, a visual display
unit and a keyboard and printer. This individual system records all completed transactions input
by the counter clerk working at that counter position. Clerks log on to the system by using their
own unique password. The transactions performed by each clerk, and the associated cash
and stock level information, are recorded by the computer system in a stock unit. Once logged
on, all completed transactions performed by the clerk must be recorded and entered on the

computer and are accounted for within the user's allocated stock unit.

The Horizon system provides a number of daily and weekly records of all completed

Version 7. 22.

transactions input into it. It enables Post Office users to obtain computer summeri:s for
individual clients of Post Office Limited e.g. Alliance & Leicester. The Horizon syst:m also
enables the clerk to produce a periodic balance of cash and stock on hand combined with the
other transactions performed in that accounting period, known as a trading period.

Where local reports are required these are accessed from a button on the desktop menu. The
user is presented with a parameter driven menu, which enables the report to be customised to
requirements. The report is then populated from transaction data that is held in the local
database and is printed out on the printer. The system also allows for information to be

transferred to the main accounting department at Chesterfield.

The Post Office counter processing functions are provided through a series of counter
applications: the Electronic Point of Sale Service (EPOSS) that enables Postmasters to
conduct general retail trade at the counter and sell products on behalf of their clients; the
Automated Payments Service (APS) which provides support for utility companies and others
who provide incremental in and out payment mechanisms based on the use of cards and other
tokens and the Logistics Feeder Service (LFS) which supports the management of cash and
value stock movements to and from the outlet, principally to minimise cash held overnight in
outlets. The counter desktop service and the office platform service on which it runs provides
various common functions for transaction recording and settlement as well as user access

control and session management.

Information from counter transactions is written into a local database and then replicated
automatically to databases on ail other counters within a Post Office outlet. The information is
then forwarded over ADSL (Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line) or other communication
service, to databases on a set of central Correspondence Servers at the Fujitsu Services data
centres. This is undertaken by a messaging transport system within the Transaction
Management Service (TMS). Various systems then transfer information to Central Servers that
control the flow of information to various support services. Details of outlet transactions are
normally sent at least daily via the system. Details are then forwarded daily via a file transfer

service to the Post Office accounting department at Chesterfield and also, where appropriates,

to other Post Office Clients.

An audit of all information handled by the TMS is taken daily by copying all new messages to
archive media. This creates a record of all completed outlet transaction details including its
origin - outlet and counter, when it happened, who caused it to happen and the outcome. The
TMS journal is maintained at each of the Fujitsu Services Data Centre sites and is created by
securely replicating all completed transaction records that occurred in every Outlet. They
therefore provide the ability to compare the audit track record of the same transaction recorded
in two places to verify that systems were operating correctly. Records of all transactions are

written to audit archive media.

The system clock incorporated into the desktop application on the counter visual display units
is configured to indicate local time. This has been the situation at West Byfleet Post Office,

Branch Code 126023 since 13 July 2000 when the Horizon system was introduced at that

particular Post Office.

The Horizon system records time in GMT and takes no account of Civil Time Displacements,
thus during British Summer Time (BST) (generally the last Sunday in March to the last Sunday
in October), system record timings are shown in GMT — one hour earlier than local time (BST).

When information relating to individual transactions is requested, the data is extracted from the
audit archive media via the Audit Workstations (AWs). Information is presented in exactly the
same way as the data held in the archive although it can be filtered depending upon the type of
information requested. The integrity of data retrieved for audit purposes is guaranteed at all
times from the point of gathering, storage and retrieval to subsequent despatch to the
requester. Controls have been established that provide assurances to Post Office Internal

Audit (POIA) that this integrity is maintained.

During audit data extractions the following controls apply :

Continuation of statement of Penelope Anne Thomas

Extractions can only be made through the AWs which exist at Fujitsu Services,
Lovelace Lane, Bracknell, Berkshire and Fujitsu Services, Sackville House, Brooks
Close, Lewes, East Sussex. These sites are both subject to rigorous physical security
controls appropriate to each location. All AWs are located in a secure room subject to
proximity pass access within a secured Fujitsu Services site.

Logical access to the AW and its functionality is managed in accordance with the

Fujitsu Services, Post Office Account Security Policy and the principles of ISO 17799.
This includes dedicated Logins, password control and the use of Microsoft Windows NT
security features.

3. All extractions are logged on the AW and supported by documented Audit Record
Queries (ARQs), authorised by nominated persons within Post Office Ltd. This log can
be scrutinised on the AW.

4. Extractions are only made by authorised individuals.

Upon receipt of an ARQ from Post Office Ltd they are interpreted by CS Security. The
details are checked and the printed request filed.

The required files are identified and marked using the dedicated audit tools.
Checksum seals are calculated for audit data files when they are written to audit
archive media and re-calculated when the files are retrieved.

8. To assure the integrity of the audit data while on the audit archive media the checksum
seal for the file is re-calculated by the Audit Track Sealer and compared to the original
value calculated when the file was originally written to the audit archive media. The
result is maintained in a Check Seal Table.

9. The specific ARQ details are used to obtain the specific data.

10. The files are copied to the AW where they are checked and converted into the file type
required by Post Office Ltd.

11. Windows Events generated by the counters within the branch/timeframe in question are
checked to ensure the counters were functioning correctly.

modification and virus checked using the latest software. It is then despatched to the

Further to my statements of 2nd February and 8th February 2010 I would like to add the

following.

I have examined the 5th Interim Technical expert's report to the Court prepared by Charles
Alastair McLachlan, a Director of Amsphere Consulting Ltd and have discussed some of the

points raised directly with Mr McLachlan in telephone conversations of 12th February 2010
and 5th March 2010.

At paragraph 1.1 of this report Mr McLachlan has produced a table of his hypotheses and
details of the conversation that we held. However, I have now had time to further assess this
report and would like to add the following comments to some of Mr McLachlan’s “hypotheses”

/mplications of most recent information -Gareth Jenkins, in a telephone interview on 12th
February 2010 confirmed the evidence in his witness statement dated 2nd February 2010
that use of the Fast Cash button could result in rejected card payment being treated as over
the counter cash. Further, he said that there was a possibility that when the touch screen
needed recalibrating a user could believe they had pressed one button while the system
recorded the pressing of a different button (the call logs to Fujistu identify that recalibration

was necessary on more than one occasion).

I have now checked all cases of Rejected Card payments and they don’t explain the

discrepancies so this hypothesis is irrelevant.

experience testing can give rise to poor data entry quality.

whether other similar issues were identified during user experience testing.

there is no evidence to indicate any system faults that result in missing transactions. The
back end systems are relevant to Post Office Ltd’s overall accounting, but not to what is

the defendant is being accused of. I am not clear exactly what test scenarios are

recovery of logs from the archive in a routine batch process which, he said, has been

be identified in the Fujitsu systems alone.

This is not relevant. The Branch accounts are based purely on whether the Branch thinks

the Debit Card was authorized or not. Any subsequent failures are irrelevant to the

branch accounts.

Hypothesis - Complex systems rarely have sufficient capability built in to deal with all
possible failure points and discrepancies are very likely to arise which require manual
intervention based on the reconciliation of paper and electronic logs at different points in the
system.

/mplications of most recent information - Gareth Jenkins, in a telephone interview on 12th
February 2010 explained that the Horizon system managed by Fujitsu is only part of a much
larger set of integrated systems used hy the Post Office to manage their counters business.
/n particular, SAP, a data warehouse and technology connecting to a merchant service

provider for card payment services is involved. The scope of the technical documentation

will need to cover all of these systems.

This is not relevant. The Branch accounts are based purely on whether the Branch thinks
the Debit Card was authorized or not. Any subsequent failures are irrelevant to the

branch accounts.

In addition to responding to this report I have also obtained the transaction logs from 1st
December 2006 to 31st December 2007 which amount to nearly half a million transactions

(431,490 to be precise).

I have searched through the logs looking for all examples of Debit Card transactions which

have not been successful, since this seems to be one of the defence’s main attacks on the

system.

There are 92 such failed transactions for a total value of £117,149.98. I've analysed all
those with an individual value of more than £1,000 (leaving £6,113.55 worth that I've not

analysed).
In all the cases I've analysed one of 3 things has happened:

1. The Customer session was then settled by a Cheque (and so the failure must have

been noticed by the clerk)

2. The Customer session was abandoned (ie any goods were returned and the

transactions cancelled and the only item from the session is the failed Debit Card payment).

3. The Customer session was settled to Cash (which could have been accidental).
However, in all such cases the transaction was subsequently reversed resulting in the cash

also being reversed.

There are business rules that control whether transactions can be cancelled or if they have
to be committed and then reversed (which is the main difference between cases 2 and 3
above). I suspect (but cannot necessarily prove) that in case 2 the sessions were for

purchase of Foreign Currency. In case 3 the sessions were all for purchase of Premium

Bonds.

I think this refutes the assertion that failed Debit Card Payments are the cause of the losses,

Without a clear directive from the defence as to what specific transactions they say have

caused errors on Horizon, I am unsure what further analysis to carry out. However, I have

identified some possible areas to pursue:

I have looked at Pouch Reversals (where cash or currency is packed for despatch to Post
Office® Ltd's Cash Centre) and the Pouch is subsequently Cancelled. This is a method by
which cash losses can be partially hidden and was mentioned in the defendant's interviews.

For December 2006 there were no such examples.

Each night there should be a Cash Declaration made for each Stock Unit in the Branch
indicating the current cash in the till. It is also possible to look at all the cash movements for
each Stock Unit by looking at the Cash transactions. I’ve tried to compare the Cash
movements in terms of the Transactions and also in terms of differences in Declarations and
there seems to be very little correlation indicating that the cash declarations are probably

inaccurate

As part of the monthly Balancing process, special transactions are recorded to reflect Stock
Adjustments and Discrepancies detected by the system as part of this process. These all
result in the system assuming that Cash it put into (or removed) from the Till to reflect

these Adjustments / Discrepancies.

I have been requested to comment on the issue raised by the defence in relation to a Post
Office® called Callender Square, Falkirk that was mentioned at the Castleton Trial. I have

examined our records and can confirm the following;

The problem occurred when transferring Cash or Stock between Stock Units. Note that
West Byfleet Post Office® does operate multiple Stock Units so the issue could have
occurred. It manifests itself by the Receiving Stock Unit not being able to “see” the Transfer

made by the “sending” Stock Unit and is compounded by attempting to make a further

transfer. Please note that such transactions usually reappear the next day. It is clearly
visible to the User as a “Receipts and Payments mismatch” at the time that one of the Stock
Units is Balanced. This usually results in the Branch raising a call. There are no such calls
in Andy Dunks’ Witness Statement of 29th January 2010 which summarises the calls raised
by West Byfleet. Also this can be checked on any Balance Reports / or Branch Trading
Statements that are available from the Branch which should show that Receipts and
Payments do match and that the Trading Position is zero. The problem is also visible when
looking at system events associated with the Branch. The System events from 30/06/2005
to 31/12/2009 for West Byfleet have been checked and no such events have been found.
The problem was fixed in the S90 Release which went live in March 2006 and so would not
have been relevant at the time of the detailed Transaction Logs obtained for West Byfleet

between December 2006 and December 2007.

Therefore I can conclude that the problems identified in Calendar Square, Falkirk are not

relevant to West Byfleet Post Office.

On 2nd October 2009 I produced a report about Horizon Data integrity. Within this report
are details about transactions (sometimes known as EPOSS transactions) and various
scenarios that could occur following system failures. In rare circumstances it is possible for
transactions to not be recorded on the local system but in all such cases the user would be

aware of this. I produce this report as exhibit GJ/01.

As with any large system there will be occasional faults such as the one found in Callender

Square, Falkirk. Any such faults, whether found during testing or from live user feedback

would be investigated and resolved appropriately. I am not aware of any such faults that
have been raised by West Byfleet Post Office®. If specific transactions can be identified

where the user feels the system has caused losses then further investigation can be made.
