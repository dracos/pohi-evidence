Subject: GLO - Mediation Update - confidential and legally privileged

All

The parties have made little progress today. The mediators have spent the majority of the day with the claimants
again.

The claimants are at 60m + 5.5m CU costs. Post Office remains at 45m + 5.5m.

We have made it clear that the mediation will end COB Monday (as we need to put pressure on the claimants to

respond and these proceedings do in fact need to end at some point particularly with the election and authority issues
which that may cause).

Next Steps
1. We will respond to their amended settlement deed over the weekend and we have requested the other side
to have their finalised position in relation to the settlement deed by Monday morning. I will make sure that the
joint statement is provided to Patrick as soon as they have provided it us. They are yet to do so.
2. The parties will provide what they say are their proposed final offers (which are not necessarily the final offer
in reality) to the mediators on a confidential basis. We are likely to go to £50 +5.5m CU costs such that if the
other side does the same ie £55m +5.5m Cl costs then ultimately the parties could spilt the difference at £52.5
+5.5m ClJ costs. Consequently, I will need authority from Tom, Tim and Nick over the weekend or first thing on
Monday to make the offer of £50m. You will note that these amounts are within the authority provided by the
Board Sub-Committee. I will also need Tom, Tim and Nick to be available to make any subsequent offers
throughout the day on Monday.

Do let me know if you have any further queries in the meantime. Happy to discuss later this evening or over the
weekend if you need.

Kind regards
Ben
