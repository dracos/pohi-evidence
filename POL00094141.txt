Witness Statements

21/01/2014

When to Take the Statement

* The passage of time often results in witnesses
forgetting crucial details.

Statements should therefore be obtained from
key witnesses at the earliest opportunity.

This ensures the evidential integrity and
content of the statement.

Considerations

A written statement is the “shop window” of
an officers work and so their professionalism
is on display.

Witnesses, magistrates, judges, solicitors and
supervisors form their opinion of an officer’s
credibility and that of Post Office Ltd on the
quality of such statements.

The Rules

* Aseparate statement will be required for each
witness.

* Statements from one witness should not be
taken in the presence of another.

+ If a witness asks to write his/her own
statement, this should be allowed but should
not generally be encouraged.

21/01/2014

* Avoid using leading questions.

* Record statements in an active style, for
example ‘I posted the letter’ rather than ‘The
letter was posted.’

* Consider using how, what, when, why and
who questions.

+ If further statements are taken from a witness,
these should be separate documents and not
additions to existing statements.

* Such additional statements should begin
“Further to my previous statement(s)...’

* All statements should be retained as either
used or unused material.

POL00094141

POL00094141

POL00094141

* Investigating Officers need to consider the
offence or the incident and the elements that
will be required to establish or prove the
offence.

21/01/2014

Find a suitable place to talk to the witness.

Put them at ease and fully discuss the incident
before embarking on the statement.

Officers should be satisfied the witness has
told them all they know, before a statement is
commenced.

Utilise cognitive interviewing skills.

If a witness has any special needs in relation
to the giving of evidence in court, such as
requiring an interpreter or they have learning
difficulties, make a separate record.

Do not detail the requirement in the
statement.

A statement should be in chronological order,
it should make sense and should be accurate.

In general terms the statement should provide
a word picture of the events as they occurred,

21/01/2014

Any notes made in the process of compiling a
statement must be retained.

They may be used to negate or confirm
subsequent statements by the same witness.
You must seek the whole truth and not just
those parts that support your case.

Never encourage a witness to make a
statement on the pretext that they will not be
called to give evidence in criminal proceedings
Do not allow the witness to exaggerate,

If it is suspected a witness is exaggerating,
remind them of their obligation and that what
they say in their statement is what they will be
expected to say at court whilst under oath.

Content.

* A statement should identify the witness and

provide details of status, occupation, position

held, relationships etc,

The statement should be in the first person

and the speech should be direct.

* Do not reveal the home address of the
witness in the body of the statement unless it
is relevant to the offence.

21/01/2014

If possible, each separate event in the
statement should be enclosed in a separate
paragraph.

It is advisable that the content of each
paragraph is checked with the witness as it is
written.

* It is important that the witness views the
statement as his, and not the officers version
of the events.

Jargon or slang should be avoided.

Abusive language should not be used unless it
is in direct speech,

{t is important that the witnesses words or
phrases are used,

SURNAMES and PLACENAMES should be in

+ Whenever practicable each item should be
given a separate reference number.

21/01/2014

Concluding the Statement

* When the full text has been written, the
witness should be asked to read it and initial
any alterations.

* Any words to be ignored should be struck
through with single line.

* Any insertions should not be written between
the lines or in the margins.

* Place a letter at the point of the insertion e.g.
‘a’ at the point of the first insertion and so on.

* Add the text of the insertion to the end of the
statement, before the signature. The text
should be marked with the letter of the
insertion.

When the content and accuracy of the
statement have been agreed, the witness
should sign each page and under the last line
of writing on the final page.

The CJA certificate on the first page should be
read and if necessary explained to the
witness.

The witness should then be invited to read
and sign the CJA declaration.

Any blank space at the end of the statement
should be struck through and initialled by the
Officer taking the statement.

21/01/2014

If the statement is made by a witness who
cannot read it, the officer taking it must read
it over to the witness before it is signed and
then add at the end of the statement:

‘The witness being unable to read the above

@ Commencing Proceedings.
@ Criminal Proceedings can be commenced in one

of three ways;
@ * 1. Charge

* 2, Requisition
@ * 3, Summons
e The vast majority of cases brought by POLtd
Q involve Defendants who are co-operating with

the process and where there is no fear of flight.
@ Invariably suspects are reported for summons
e to enable legal advice.
@ The Requisition [under s29 Criminal Justice Act

2003] is available to the police only and in effect

POL00094141
POL00094141

+ In our case if the advice is to proceed we will
draft proposed charges which are then laid
before the appropriate Magistrates Court with
a request that a summons issues.

* The request or “information” for the issue of a
summons has to be considered by an
authorised officer of the court. A summons
when issued will set out the date time and
place of the first hearing which the Defendant
is required to attend.

21/01/2014

Service

* The Summons must then be served. The
Criminal Procedure Rules 2013 control the
methods of service.

4)

* There are many ways in which documents can
be served, but in the case of a summons
alleging an offence the method of service is
limited in the case of an individual to either;

+ Handing it to him or her

* By addressing it to him or her and leaving it at
the appropriate address for service, or by
sending it to that address by first class post or
the equivalent of first class post.

POL00094141

POL00094141

POL00094141
POL00094141

* The “appropriate address for service” for an
individual is an address where it is reasonably
believed that he or she will receive it.

Note: The same provisions apply to the service
of a witness summons.

21/01/2014

Date of Service

The effective date of service is;
Personal service — the day of service

Leaving at the address — the next business day
after leaving

First Class Posting - the second business day
after the day on which the summons was
posted,

Service Overseas

This is unlikely to be an issue, but statutory
provision means that summonses can be
served from England into Scotland and
Northern Ireland. In respect of other countries
service is possible but means involving the
Home Office and would require separate
advice.

POL00094141

POL00094141

POL00094141
POL00094141

Proof of Service

* Usually by a brief certificate endorsed on a
copy of the summons confirming how and
when the summons was served and signed
and dated by the person who dealt with it.
Certified proof will enable the advocate to
request a warrant of arrest if the Defendant
fails to appear.

21/01/2014

Magistrates cannot require service by one of
the available methods when issuing a
summons, but if service by post fails the
Magistrates can direct service by another
means, usually personally.

It is vital that the legal team are aware of the
return date of the summons as soon as
possible after issue to enable us to make
arrangements to cover the first hearing and
provide disclosure documents.

[If the suspect has been represented it is very
useful to get the details of the firm concerned
to enable early action.]

THE POCKET NOTEBOOK

21/01/2014

* Only have one pocket notebook in use at any
time.

* Make entries every working day in indelible
ink.

* Make entries in chronological order at the
time of the occurrence or as soon as possible
thereafter.

* The reason for any delay in making an entry
should be recorded.

* Do not erase mistakes; They should be crossed
through with a single line and initialled.

* Entries should be made on the next available
line

* There should be no blank lines between the
entries.

Pocket Notebook Usage.

* The amount of information recorded in a PNB
will vary according to the circumstances.

+ As a minimum the record should contain
sufficient information to recall the
circumstances of the event at a later date, in
particular when giving evidence in court.

You should include:

* All relevant times e.g. of the incident, arrival
and departure.

+ The exact location.

* Type of occurrence or offence

* Name, date of birth, occupation, address,
telephone numbers/contact details of all
persons involved or suspected,

agencies present at the scene.

Direct speech used, unsolicited comments,
admissions, denials etc.

Vehicle details (if relevant)
Property recovered.
This list is not exhaustive.

21/01/2014

The PNB should be the primary record in the
following circumstances:-

* Details of tape-recorded interviews;

* Significant statements which must be put to
the suspect at the start of the interview
Unsolicited comments made by a suspect
outside the context of a formal interview
which may be relevant to an offence.

Recording of Evidence
or Significant Occurrence,

The primary purpose of the PNB is to record
evidence and also as an aid to memory.

The PNB should always be the first record of
evidence.

Investigating Officers should not use their own
statement of evidence as the first record of
evidence unless their PNB was not available at
the time and the record was made on the day
of and as soon as practicable after the incident.

POL00094141

POL00094141

POL00094141
POL00094141

* Investigating officers must record the full
details of any incident and any other details
they feel may assist them to recall the
circumstances of the event at a later date, in
particular when they are giving evidence in
court.

21/01/2014

* Investigating Officers should ensure that

verbal evidence recorded from suspects in
their PNB is shown to the suspect and the
suspect given the opportunity to read and sign
the PNB,

* A refusal to read or sign should be noted by

the officer in his/her PNB.

If this process is not undertaken the evidence
may be deemed inadmissible in court.

The longer the delay in completing the entry
the greater is the chance of the investigating
officer's memory becoming unreliable and
evidence being compromised and/or
challenged in court.

if operational considerations mean that an
entry cannot be made at the time of the event
it should where possible be made before
moving to another case.

Subsequent Contact

+ The CPIA 1997 places a statutory responsibility
on all Investigators involved in the conduct of
a criminal investigation to record and retain
relevant material.

Any contact, either in person or by other
media e.g. text, voicemail, e-mail etc must be
regarded as potentially relevant and therefore
should be recorded and retained in a durable
and readable form.

+ The use of the power must be fully justified.
Officers exercising the power should consider
if the necessary objectives could be met by
other, less intrusive, means.

+ The absence of justification could lead to
challenges should the case proceed to court,
and civil claims against the police for unlawful
arrest and false imprisonment

The power to arrest should be exercised in a
non-discriminatory and proportionate
manner.

21/01/2014

* Section 24 of PACE (as substituted by Section
110 of the Serious Organised Crime and Police
Act 2005) provides the statutory power for a
constable to arrest without warrant for all
offences

* Ifthe provisions of the Act and Code G are not
observed, both the arrest and the conduct of
any subsequent investigation may be open to
question.

Elements of Arrest under Section 24.

A lawful request requires two elements:-

* A person’s involvement or suspected
involvement or attempted involvement in the
commission of a criminal offence;

AND

* Reasonable grounds for believing that the
person's arrest is necessary.

Necessity Criteria

sb

ea

21/01/2014

* The power of arrest is only exercisable if the
constable has reasonable grounds for
believing that it is necessary to arrest the
person.

+ The statutory criteria for what may constitute
necessity are set out in paragraph 2.9 of the
Code.

It remains an operational decision at the

discretion of the constable to decide:

* Which one or more of the necessity criteria (if
any) applies to the individual;

And

* If any of the criteria do apply, whether to
arrest, grant street bail after arrest, report for
summons or for charging by post, issue a
penalty notice or take any other action open
to the officer.

-

The necessity criteria requires the constable to
examine and justify the reason(s) for an arrest.

In applying the criteria, the arresting officer has
to be satisfied that at least one of the reasons
supporting the need for arrest is satisfied.

&

21/01/2014

+ The criteria in para 2.9 (which are also set out
in $24 PACE as substituted by S110 Serious
Organised Crime and Police Act 2005) are
exhaustive.

However the circumstances that may satisfy
those criteria remain a matter for the
operational discretion of individual officers.
The constable must take into account the
situation of the victim, the nature of the
offence, the circumstances of the suspect and
the needs of the investigative process.

When it is practicable to tell a person why their
arrest is necessary, the constable should outline
the facts, information and other circumstances
which provide the grounds for believing that
their arrest is necessary and which the officer
considers satisfy one or more of the statutory

criteria in sub-paragraphs (a) to (f); ©

a) To enable the name of the person in question
to be ascertained (in the case where the
constable does not know, and cannot readily
ascertain, the person’s name, or has reasonable
grounds for doubting whether a name given by
a person is his real name).

21/01/2014

b) To enable the address of the person to be
ascertained.

An officer might decide that an address cannot
be readily ascertained if the person refuses to
provide it, particularly following a warning that a
failure to provide it may lead to arrest, or if the
person appears reluctant or hesitant or is unable
to provide verifiable details of the locality in
which he/she claims to reside.

c) to prevent the person in question:

{i) Causing physical injury to himself or others;

{ii) Suffering physical injury;

(iii) Causing loss or damage to property;

(iv)Committing an offence against public
decency;

(v) Causing an unlawful obstruction of the
highway.

from the person in question.

21/01/2014

e) To allow the prompt and effective
investigation of the offence or of the conduct of
the person in question. See Note 2E.

* This may arise when it is thought likely that
unless the person is arrested and then either
taken into custody or street bailed to attend
the station later, further action considered
necessary to properly investigate their
involvement in the offence would be
frustrated, unreasonably delayed or otherwise
hindered and therefore be impracticable.

Note 2E: The meaning of ‘prompt’ should be
considered on a case by case basis taking
account of all the circumstances. It indicates
that the progress of the investigation should not
be delayed to the extent that it would adversely
affect the effectiveness of the investigation. The
arresting officer also has discretion to release
the arrested person on street bail as an
alternative to taking the person directly to the
station. See Note 2J.

Note 2): Having determined that the necessity
criteria have been met and having made the
arrest, the officer can then consider the use of
street bail on the basis of the effective and
efficient progress of the investigation of the
offence in question. It gives the officer discretion
to compel the person to attend a police station
at a date/time that best suits the overall needs
of the particular investigation...

21/01/2014

Examples:

i) Interviewing the suspect on occasions when
the person’s voluntary attendance is not
considered to be a practicable alternative to
arrest, because for example;

It is thought unlikely that the person will

attend the station voluntarily to be

interviewed.

It is necessary to interview the suspect about

the outcome of other investigative action (see

(ii) to (v))

Arrest would enable the special warning to be
given...when the suspect is found:

In possession of incriminating objects, or at a
place where such objects are found;

At or near the scene of the crime at or about
the time it was committed.

The person has made false statements and/or
presented false evidence.

* Itis thought likely that the person:
- May steal or destroy evidence;

- May collude or make contact with, co-
suspects or conspirators;

~ May intimidate or threaten or make contact
with witnesses.

See Notes 2F and 2G

21/01/2014

Note 2F: An officer who believes that it is necessary
to interview the person suspected of committing the
offence must then consider whether their arrest is
necessary in order to carry out the interview. The
Officer is not required to interrogate the suspect to
determine whether they will attend the police
station voluntarily to be interviewed but they must
consider whether the suspect’s voluntary
attendance is a practicable alternative for carrying
out the interview. If it is, then arrest would not be
necessary...Without such considerations, the officer
would not be able to establish that arrest was
necessary in order to interview.

Circumstances which suggest that a person’s arrest
‘on the street’ would not be necessary to interview
them might be where the officer:

* Is satisfied as to their identity and address and
that they will attend the police station voluntarily
to be interviewed, either immediately or by
arrangement at a future date and time; and

* Is not aware of any other circumstances which
indicate that voluntary attendance would not be
a practicable alternative. See para 2.9 (e)(i) to (v).

Note 2G:When the person attends the police station
voluntarily for interview by arrangement as in Note 2F,
their arrest on arrival at the station prior to the interview
would only be justified if:

New information coming to light after the
‘arrangements were made indicates that from that
time, voluntary attendance ceased to be a practicable
alternative and the persons arrest became necessary;
an

It was not reasonably practicable for the person to be
arrested before they attended...

if a person who attends...voluntarily..decides to leave
before the interview is complete, the police would at that
point be entitled to consider whether their arrest was
necessary to carry out the interview...
