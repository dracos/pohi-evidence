Hi Alice — just a quick follow up to the case of the sub-postmaster (Martin Griffiths) which Paula briefed you on in the
reception yesterday. You asked whether anyone had been in touch with James Arbuthnot’s office, given that he was
copied into Alan Bate’s email. Just to confirm, Susan spoke to Janet (JA’s assistant) early last week to explain the
situation and what we’re doing. We'll provide a further update probably later this week once we have further news

We’re keeping in close touch with Martin’s wife and providing all the support we can — including putting in place a
temporary sub-postmaster in his branch and continuing to pay Martin.

We’ve also been keeping BIS in the loop, given that AB copied in Jo Swinson.

Thanks, Martin

Martin Edwards I Chief of Staff to the Chief Executive
