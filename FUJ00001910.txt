incorrect and both parties will attempt to resolve any dispute at the operational
level.

to the Service Management Forum for discussion and resolution.

If a dispute cannot be resolved at the Service Management Forum, the issue will be
referred to the Commercial Forum where it will be resolved using the established
“Case Law’ procedure.

Once both parties have agreed on the value of the financial payment, Fujitsu
