CALL PC0027581:Priority C:CallType L - Target 16/07/99 11:40:38

lkeffering to call from Mr Lui, is concerned that when Mr Lui (FAD 261511) had
suggested that he had logged onto 2 counters (7/7/99 not sure what time) at
the same time. NBSC are concerned that this has happened as it is not
supposed to.07/07/99 20:08 wk059150 Information: Reassigning for

Jadditional information. Did the PM log into both counters or transfer the
session. Or did he qo onthe other counter under someone elses logon. Please
ldvise as this is unclearin the call he did. 07/07/99 20:23
vk066121 Information: PM Mr Lui -{ spoke to PM, was

printing final cash account (19:02°7/7799 Gall refs 9907070014/ 205/ 239/
263/ 272) which hung for an hour on counter 2, was asked to log onto gateway
to try to also print out final CA which printed off. The slave was still
showing ‘printing report’ while he was logged onto gateway and printing the
same report. Gateway started to show no entry signs on logout and other
icons but was unclear when. Office seemed to roll over alright and calls were
jclosed. NBSC were concerned that the PM had logged on to 2 counters but we
lhad done nothing about it. 07/07/99 20:45 uk066121 Information: It

is unclear as to wether the user was logged on to 2 counters, an explanation
is that he had just transferred sessions while one was apparently ‘hanging’.
BSC are more concerned that he had suggested he had and that HSH had not
taken him seriously. When I spoke Mr Lui was vague in what he had actually d
lone. 09/07/99 11:30 uk061353 Information: I an currently getting the
leventlogs for both counters so that SSC can look at them and confirm weather
the PMwas actuly logged onto both counters at the same time rather than the
sessiontransfer over to the other counter. 09/07/99 11:34 uk061353

It understand from the limited info above, that a user, may log himself on to
the system at a gateway and slave counter at the same time. Assuming there
lare no more subtle issues here, riposte 19 has made no change to this fault.
It simply entered a user's name and password at both counters and selected
lenter. I was logged on at the gateway and slave.

hat appears to have happened is that Escher took this on board to fix,
failed to make any real difference, and are now saying it is working as
lesigned. Surely it can not be by design that a user can log on
simultaneously on two counters. I do not believe that controlling logging on
land off of users at this level is an application function. This needs to go
to Escher as a definite deficiency.

lalters analysis isn't far out. He wasn’t present at the meeting of the 14th
here I think it was agreed that the EPOSS guys would try to create a
jorkround for what in my opinion is an Escher bug. (Simultaneous logon should
ideally be allowed if the lan is disconnected only.) I am returning this to
FP for visability, but would be happy to have it back for my "Parked" pinicl
stack. If any manager wants to argue the case with Escher I would be
kielighted. Brian

Brian, I have now discussed this with both you and Mark Scardifield. This is
clearly a bug in the Supplier's code and as you say, management pressure must
Ibe brought to bear as necessary to make the Supplier accept and respond to
[that fact. Firstly to that end, can you demonstrate that the problem still
exists in the latest Riposte release and record your findings in this PinICL,
together with a description of how you reproduced it (at a keystroke level if
necessary) .

in the mean time, our Customer continues to suffer from the problem, and we
must seek to ameliorate this as best we may. I have therefore asked Mark to
reconsider the possibility of an EPOSS work around targetted at late S10R if
jpossible else BI 3. When I have his response I will update this call again.
