Dear both, your help please in answers and in phrasing those answers, in prep for the
SC:

1) "is it possible to access the system remotely? We are told it is."

What is the true answer? I hope it is that we know this is not possible and that we are
able to explain why that is. I need to say no it is not possible and that we are sure of
this because of xxx and that we know this because we have had the system assured.
2) "you have said this is such a vital system to the Post Office, what testing do you
POL00162287
POL00162287

do and how often? When was the last time?

Lesley, I need the facts on these - I know we have discussed before but I haven't got
the answer front of mind - too many facts to hold in my head! But this is an important
one and I want to be sure I do have it. And then Mark, to phrase the facts into
answers, plus a line to take the conversation back up a level - ie., to one of our
narrative boxes/rocks.

Thanks, Paula
