53 The SGEI Payment for each of the Financial Years 2012/13, 2013/14 and 2014/15

54 The Secretary of State agrees:

(a) to submit for approval of both Houses of Parliament as soon as reasonably practicable
any order amending or replacing the Order to increase the maximum amount payable

(d) to notify Mails and POL in writing as

soon as reasonably practicable afier such

5.5 If and to the extent that the Secretary of State determines to make any part of any
SGEI Payment by way of paying such amount to Holdings or Mails for the purpose of its
being applied in subscription for shares in POL, any such payment to Mails or Holdings shall
be held by Mails or Holdings, as applicable, upon trust to apply it immediately for the purpose
for which it was paid.

5.6 The amount of the SGEI Payment payable in each of the Financial Years 2012/13,
2013/14 and 2014/15 shall be calculated in accordance with Schedule 3 (Calculation of SGEI
Payment), but subject always to the aggregate amount of all SGEI Payments during the
Funding Period not exceeding one billion one hundred and fifty-five million pounds
(£1,155,000,000). Each SGEI Payment shall be made by way of payment on I April (or the
first Business Day thereafter) of the relevant Financial Year of the amount specified in clause
5.7 (subject to adjustment in accordance with clause 5.11).

5.7 The amount payable on account of the SGEI Payment (subject to reconciliation in
accordance with clause 5.10) in:

(a) the Financial Year 2012/13 shall be four hundred and ten million pounds
(£410,000,000);

(£415,000,000); and

(c) the Financial Year 2014/15 shall be three hundred and thirty million pounds
(£330,000,000).

In ascertaining for any purpose of this clause 5 the amount or maximum amount of any SGEI

5.8 The Secretary of State acknowledges that, without prejudicing his discretion to
determine the method of payment of the SGEI Payment referred to in clause 5.3 above, it is
his current expectation that:

(a) two hundred and ten million pounds (£210,000,000) of the SGEI Payment for
Financial Year 2012/13;

(b) two hundred million pounds (£200,000,000) of the SGEI Payment for Financial Year
2013/14; and

(c) one hundred and sixty million pounds (£160,000,000) of the SGEI Payment for
Financial Year 2014/15

will be made by way of a payment under a network subsidy scheme introduced under the
Order provided that: (i) the necessary statutory instrument to permit such payment has been
approved by an affirmative resolution of each House of Parliament; and (ii) any necessary
consent to the making of such statutory instrument has been given by the Lords
Commissioners of Her Majesty’s Treasury.

5.9 It is acknowledged by the Parties that any part of the SGEI Payments received by
POL under a network subsidy scheme pursuant to section 103 of the Act (currently expected
to be the amounts specified in clause 5.8 above) would be treated as revenue in POL’s
accounts, which has an impact on POL’s operating profit. Should any SGEI Payment (or part
thereof) be made in any Financial Year in any manner which would result in it not being
treated as revenue in POL’s accounts then any target operating profit applicable for any
purpose to POL or, prior to a Separation Event, the Royal Mail Group as a whole in such
Financial Year shall be reduced by the amount of any SGEI Payment (or part thereof)
received in any such manner in that Financial Year.

5.10 I Within three months following the signature of POL’s accounts in respect of each of
the Financial Years 2012/13, 2013/14 and 2014/15, POL shall provide to the Secretary of
State a statement (the SGEI Statement) setting out in writing the actual amount of the SGEI
Payment for that Financial Year and a cumulative statement (the Cumulative SGEI
Statement) setting out the cumulative amount of the SGEI Payments from the commencement
of the Funding Period, together with supporting calculations and a clear explanation of how
the actual amount of the SGEI Payment has been calculated. Each SGEI Statement shall be
accompanied by a statement (the SGEI Supporting Statement) from an independent firm of
financial advisers confirming:

(a) that the SGEI Statement has been properly prepared in accordance with the
requirements of Schedule 3 (Calculation of SGEI Payment) and any additional
conditions imposed by any relevant State Aid Clearance; and

(b) that while carrying out its financial analysis for the purposes of providing the
statement referred to in paragraph (a) above, they did not discover any inconsistency
of POL’s use of the SGEI Payments as against the terms of this Agreement or of any
applicable State Aid Clearance.

For the avoidance of doubt, the independent firm of financial advisers will not be responsible
for determining whether the allocation of costs in paragraph 3 of Schedule 3 (Calculation of
SGEI Payment) is appropriate or whether the profit in paragraph 4 of Schedule 3 (Calculation
of SGEI Payment) is reasonable. POL agrees to use reasonable endeavours to engage such
independent firm of financial advisers on the basis that, if requested by the Secretary of State
and on such terms as the financial advisers may agree:

1ON13373033 Page 8

POL00362107
POL00362107

POL-BSFF-0190617_0009
CONFORMED COPY

(c) an accountancy firm nominated by the Secretary of State shall be entitled to discuss
directly with the financial advisers the manner in which the SGEI Supporting
Statement has been prepared; and

(d) the financial advisers shall provide to the Secretary of State all notes and other work
products produced by them in the preparation of the SGEI Supporting Statement.

5.11 If following the end of the Funding Period the Cumulative SGEI Statement in respect
of Financial Years 2012/13, 2013/14 and 2014/15 shows that the aggregate actual amount of
the SGEI Payments over the Funding Period is less than one billion one hundred and fifty-five
million pounds (£1,155,000,000) POL shall, within ten (10) Business Days of receipt by the
Secretary of State of the Cumulative SGEI Statement referred to in clause 5.10, reimburse to
the Secretary of State, without deduction, an amount equal to the difference.

5.12 POL shall use each SGEI Payment only to meet the direct and indirect costs
associated with: (i) maintaining a network of post offices in accordance with clause 12
(Access Criteria); and (ii) ensuring the provision of services of general economic interest over
that network (as entrusted to it pursuant to the Entrustment Letter), as described in Schedule 3
(Calculation of SGEI Payment) (or to make any reimbursement required to be made by POL
pursuant to clause 5.11) and only for purposes permitted by any State Aid Clearance
applicable to it.

5.13 It is the mutual opinion of the Parties that the SGEI Payments received by POL will
not (and POL agrees not to take any steps with the intention of procuring that they will)
constitute, for VAT purposes, the consideration for any taxable supply and that, accordingly,
the receipt by POL of such SGEI Payments should not give rise to any liability of POL (or
any other member of the Royal Mail Group) to account for VAT in respect of any such
receipt. Notwithstanding the foregoing opinion, if it should, at any time (whether or not a time
falling within the duration of this Agreement), be determined by Her Majesty’s Revenue and
Customs that such SGEI Payments (or any of them) must be treated as the consideration for
taxable supplies made by POL (or, as the case may be, by any other member of the Royal
Mail Group) and that in consequence POL (or such other member of the Royal Mail Group) is
liable to account for VAT in respect of the receipt of any of such SGEI Payments (the VAT
Amount), POL shall notify the Secretary of State of that determination within five (5)
Business Days of being so advised by Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs and the Secretary
of State shall, as soon as reasonably practicable following notification of such determination,
make a payment to POL, in addition to all amounts otherwise payable by the Secretary of
State to POL under this Agreement, of a sum equal to the VAT Amount, against production of
a valid VAT invoice.

5.14 If Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs issues a determination as referred to in clause
5.13, the Parties shall (acting reasonably) consult as to what action to take regarding such
determination. If the Secretary of State disagrees with the determination he may, within ten
(10) Business Days of being notified by POL of such determination, give written notice to
POL that he requires POL (or any other Party) to obtain a review by Her Majesty’s Revenue
and Customs of that determination; and POL (or such other Party, as the case may be) shall
promptly request (the form of that request being subject to reasonable review by the Secretary
of State) Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs to undertake such review. In the event that the
review results in POL obtaining a refund of any VAT Amount, or not being required to pay a
VAT Amount, in each case in respect of which the Secretary of State shall have made a
corresponding payment under clause 5.13, POL shall promptly refund to the Secretary of
State the amount of such corresponding payment.

5.15. The Secretary of State acknowledges the expectation of the Parties that ongoing SGEI
Payments will be required to be made to POL following the end of the Funding Period to the
extent that POL may be requested to continue to provide services of general economic interest
following the Funding Period.

6. POL STRATEGIC PLAN

6.1 POL shall from 1 April 2011 use its best endeavours to procure the delivery of the
Strategic Plan within the financial parameters of the SGEI Payments provided pursuant to this
Agreement and (unless otherwise agreed by the Secretary of State or required by the terms of
any State Aid Clearance) POL shall not apply any SGEI Payment for a purpose inconsistent
with the Strategic Plan or make any material deviation from the Strategic Plan.

6.2 Until the occurrence of a Separation Event, unless POL and the Secretary of State
agree otherwise, POL undertakes in favour of the Secretary of State to apply in the normal
course any funds representing an aggregate out-performance of POL’s net cashflow over the
Funding Period relative to the net cashflow envisaged in POL’s financial forecasts within the
Strategic Plan to reduce POL's borrowings under the POL Working Capital Facility, subject
only to the fiduciary duties of the directors of POL. The Parties acknowledge that following
any Separation Event the method of reimbursement will need to be reviewed and potentially
amended.

7. MAILS’ ACKNOWLEDGMENT

71 For so long as POL remains a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mails and Mails remains
wholly-owned by the Crown, Mails agrees that it shall (insofar as is lawful and consistent
with the fiduciary duties of the directors of Mails in the context of Mails’ insolvency and
appropriate for a parent company in its position) take all necessary steps, including
minimising any downside for POL, and take responsibility for requiring that POL takes all
necessary steps, to execute the strategy agreed upon for POL wholly within the financial
resources made available to POL by this Agreement.

7.2 For so long as POL remains a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mails and Mails remains

in good faith any request to make available to POL inter-company debt facilities, where such
request is received from POL or the Secretary of State during the Funding Period.

8. HOLDINGS’ ACKNOWLEDGMENT

For so long as POL and Mails remain wholly-owned subsidiaries of Holdings, Holdings
acknowledges the steps required to be taken by Mails under clause 7 (Mails’

procure that Mails takes those steps.

10. EMPLOYEE INCENTIVE ARRANGEMENTS

wide arrangements which are related to the performance of POL) are designed to
incentivise and reward the performance of POL;

(b) the terms of such bonus arrangements are robust, subject to annual review and
designed not to provide rewards where POL’s business has not performed
satisfactorily against the relevant target; and

(c) accordingly, no such bonus arrangements will pay out in respect of any Financial
Year during the Funding Period in which POL seeks and obtains new funding from
the Secretary of State, over and above that anticipated in this Agreement, as a result
of a failure by POL to perform in accordance with the requirements of the Strategic
Plan (other than as a result of a change in Government policy or other reasons beyond
POL's control). Any future bonus arrangements following any such Financial Year
will be discussed with the Secretary of State at the time.

right to receive: (i) fixed pay; or (ii) any compensation payment for termination of such
agency contract (other than in respect of a breach by POL of the terms of such agency
contract or applicable law).

11.3. POL shall ensure that (save as required by law or contractual requirements) following
1 April 2012, no compensation payments may be paid to any sub-postmaster upon

as not to impose undue hardship when considering the appropriate Branch network.

20. GENERAL

Secretary of State

20.1 Nothing in this Agreement fetters the powers conferred on the Sceretary of State by
the Act.

Costs

20.2 Save as expressly provided for elsewhere in this Agreement, each of the Parties shall
at its own expense do all such things as shall be necessary to give full effect to the obligations
imposed on it under this Agreement.

Third parties

20.3. For the purposes of the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999, no person other
than a Party shall have any rights in respect of this Agreement.

Counterparts
20.4 This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by the Parties on

separate counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be an original, but
all the counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.

Partial invalidity
20.5 If any term or provision in this Agreement is held to be illegal or unenforceable in
whole or in part under any enactment or rule of law, such term or provision or part shall to
that extent be deemed not to form part of this Agreement but the enforceability of the
remainder of this Agreement shall not be affected.

Rights, variations and waivers

20.6 The rights and remedies of the Parties shall not be affected by any failure to exercise
or delay in exercising any right or remedy or by the giving of any indulgence by any other
Party or by anything whatsoever except a specific waiver or release in writing and any such
waiver or release shall not prejudice or affect any other rights or remedies of the Parties. No
single or partial exercise of any right or remedy prevents any further or other exercise thereof

and may be given subject to any conditions thought fit by the grantor. The person seeking the

effective only in the instance and only for the purpose for which it is given.

Remedies

acknowledges and agrees that damages alone would not be an adequate remedy for any
breach by a Party of the provisions of this Agreement, and that the remedies of injunction and
specific performance as well as any other equitable relief for any threatened or actual breach
of the provisions of this Agreement by a Party may be more appropriate remedies and that no
proof of special damages shall be necessary for the enforcement of this Agreement.

Governing law and jurisdiction

20.10 This Agreement and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in relation to
this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with English law.

20.11 Each Party hereby submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England.
