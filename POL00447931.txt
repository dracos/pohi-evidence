IMPROVING OUR POSTMASTERS’ EXPERIENCE

Our aim from our recent restructure is to create a better, more consistent experience for our Postmasters and improving
support for them by providing clearly defined teams to help with their needs and requests — in one interaction, rather than several.

We are increasing our support resource with additional Support Advisor roles being recruited to further strengthen our frontline
provision for our Postmasters. We're also building capability for teams to be multi-skilled to support their own development as
well as enabling us to offer better service levels for our Postmasters.
