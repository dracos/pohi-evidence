You may notice that I have put you down in the list of attendees. I know you will be away and there will be a locum, but
was not sure whether the locum would attend or another PS. Grateful if you could change that in the briefing. Hope
that’s okay!

Let me know if anything is unclear or you need us to make some tweaks.
Thanks a million.

Cecilia
