Subject: Re: Draft Scottish Prosecution process

Jarnail, Martin and John

I am happy with Jarnail's suggestion as long as Martin is happy to look at the case first with one eye on the need for
corroboration in Scotland and the necessity for an increased reliance on Horizon. Martin - I am happy to discuss
further but that is now set out in yesterday's paper. As we have discussed before, our disclosure obligation is a bit
more extensive because of corroboration and the other issues.

Kind regards
Laura
