Subject: Gaerwen
Hi Brian

I have received your voice mails concerning Gaerwen, you were obviously trying to call we while I was travelling
home.

No Brian, I cannot reproduce the data and add it to my statement. As I have already explained, I was unable to
produce these nil transactions in the form requested by the customer, they required an analysis of the data refuting the
Post Master's allegation that Nil transactions were responsible for the loss of funds. I do not have enough knowledge
of the data held on the system to explain the Nil transactions away, ie what the messages actually mean. And if I were
to produce the data I would be unable to support them in the witness box. And the whole exercise here is to support
integrity of data.

As far as I can see our only way forward is for Gareth to review the spreadsheets, and the process used to retrieve
them, and for him to then re-submit the data and confirm that it was retrieved in the correct manner, correctly. Or, it
may be easier for him to reproduce the data himself and submit it into evidence. Failing that, we need to ask Mik
Peach if his guys can help. But how many witness statements can we provide for one case and still seem credible.

Kind regards
Penny
