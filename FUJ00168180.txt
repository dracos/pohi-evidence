Key Points / Overall Progress

More Letters screens are active and some fixes have been identified — but
we have not yet get the Letters estate up and running (thus still failing first
demand from 1/6 call)

Circa. 120 unknown problems remain

Database remains unreliable — configuration mgmt ‘going back to grass
roots’ (reported on joint Red Alert call of 13/6)

FJS team working hard, but in 5 weeks we have achieved relatively little

RMG has concern of FUJS true attention to ‘RED’ status :

Key FJS resources shifting off to other things

Tasks agreed on daily call not being performed e.g. daily dashboard
Insufficient resourcing e.g. engineers for problem site visits

Early draft of Recovery Plan has unrealistic timescales

RMG consider we only move out of RED when the Recovery Plan is
delivered, not when it is agreed (FJS have failed to deliver to plan on
numerous occasions already)
