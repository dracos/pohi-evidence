The Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry 8 December 2022

Thursday, 8 December 2022

(10.00 am)

THE USHER: Good morning everyone. This is just to
let you know that unfortunately we need to pause
for about ten minutes. The hearing will be
starting probably about 10.10, I would think,
Thank you very much, Ill come and do another
announcement shortly.

(10.02 am)

(Proceedings delayed)
(10.15 am)

THE USHER: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your

patience. We are trying to resolve an important
technical glitch, so now the hearing has been
deferred until 10.30. Thank you. I shall
announce again when we're ready to start

(10.16 am)

(A short break)

(10.33 am)

THE USHER: Ladies and gentlemen, a quick update:
the Chair would like to make a brief
announcement so he'll be coming in shortly.
Thank you.

SIR WYN WILLIAMS: This not what I had in mind, but

I've come in because I want to know from those

waiting to do so.
SIR WYN WILLIAMS: No, no, I follow all that.

MR STEIN: So we may need, even a few minutes right

now, just to discuss this particular issue.

SIR WYN WILLIAMS: Well, on the basis of your
estimates, we can reasonably delay for at least
another 30 minutes, which is what I'm prepared
to do. We resume it at that point. But, of
course, I'l be holding you all to your
estimates much more strictly, even than usual.

(10.35 am)

(A short break)

(11.00 am)

SIR WYN WILLIAMS: Give us a factual update,
Mr Beer.

MR BEER: Yes, of course. I'm afraid it’s not been
possible to resolve the technical issue that is
preventing the Inquiry from presently streaming
the proceedings. That is an issue to do with
this building's connectivity. However, if you
do decide to proceed, sir, I have been told that
a transcript of today's proceedings will be made
as we go along and, in fact, will be displayed

for people in this room in the usual way. But,

they want because, although there is a great
Public interest in having a live feed, in my
view, there's a greater public interest in
dealing with this expeditiously today and also
giving people a reasonable amount of time.
So there's a limit on how long I'm prepared
to wait for a live feed -- that's what it boils
down to -- but it would obviously assist me if
people could explain how long they intend to
take.
So let’s go by the batting order, I think
Mr Chapman was first up.
Oh, sorry, Ms Gallafent. There we are, I'm
completely disoriented, I'm sorry.
MS GALLAFENT: I will be definitely 45 minutes,
possibly a litle bit longer.
SIR WYN WILLIAMS: Right.
MR CHAPMAN: Ten minutes.
SIR WYN WILLIAMS: So that's an hour-ish.
MR MOLONEY: 25, sir.
SIR WYN WILLIAMS: Mr Henry?
MRHENRY: 40, sir.
SIR WYN WILLIAMS: Mr Stein?

MR STEIN: 45. We have clients who are wishing to

more importantly, that will be uploaded to the
Inquiry’s website at the conclusion of
proceedings today.

An audio and visual recording of today's
proceedings will also be made and that will also
be uploaded to the Inquiry's website in the
normal way, So people who missed the proceedings
unfolding today can watch them back after they
have concluded.

So, essentially, what is missing is the live
YouTube feed, which means that members of the
public who are not in this room, and those Core
Participants who are not in this room, will be
unable to see and hear the proceedings, as they
unfold.

SIR WYN WILLIAMS: My inclination is that, in those
circumstances, although it's not ideal, it's
better than adjourning, which is the option, in
effect.

Mr Stein?

MR STEIN: We have clients that have been emailing
my instructing solicitors asking for when the
live stream is going to be available and hoping
that they will be able to take part in this

remotely. On the other side of the coin, there

is offered three dates on which to attend.
Delays can occur where other parties, such as
legal representatives or medical practitioners,

information is requested as a prerequisite to

Post Office continues to look at ways to
streamline the dispute resolution process,
including the good faith meetings, to reduce the
time taken, whilst continuing to ensure that it
enables applicants and applications to be
resolved fairly and in good faith.
Can I turn to late applicants, dealt with at

paragraph 7.3.

SIR WYN WILLIAMS: Before you do, just so I can keep
track of what you say, have I got this right:
there have been 100 good faith meetings?

MS GALLAFENT: Yes.

SIR WYN WILLIAMS: In 29 of them, there's been
an increase in the offer where people are
unrepresented, yes?

MS GALLAFENT: No, the increases in the offer where

people are unrepresented, that may have been

that date, it had extended its financial support
to Post Office so that it could accept eligible
late applications as part of the scheme.

Post Office has now written to all but one
of the 230 postmasters who previously told it
that they wished to join the HSS, after the
November 2020 deadline, inviting them to join
the scheme, providing them with an application
form and the Consequential Loss Principles and
Guidance. On 12 October Post Office also put
a notice on the Historical Shortfall Scheme.
website, inviting further such applications,
linking to a late applicant specific question
and answer document and the application form.
Sir, we provided copies of those documents to go
with our written submissions for your note.

As at yesterday, Post Office has received
93 late applications, of which 66 contain
a complete set of information. At this stage,
Post Office has assessed 68 claims for
eligibility under the scheme. I note that some
applications contain more than one claim, for
example, if there was more than one Post Office
under that particular postmaster.

There should be confirmation of eligibility

before a good faith meeting, at a good faith
meeting or afterwards.

SIR WYN WILLIAMS: So have you got any information
about what has happened after a good faith
meeting in terms of increase or acceptance?

MS GALLAFENT: Yes, and I'll ~ those are set out in
our written submissions. I can take you to them
at paragraph ~ yes, we have set those out.

Yes.

SIR WYN WILLIAMS: Thank you. Right.

MS GALLAFENT: So I was just picking up on the
‘ongoing consideration of ways we can streamline
the process.

Moving then to late applications,
paragraph 7.3, these are obviously applications
that are made or will be made after the
27 November 2020 deadline for the scheme. For
the purposes of today, I'm not going to focus on
the reasons for delay in determining whether
those applications should have been accepted or
rejected into the scheme. I obviously recognise
that’s a matter to which the Inquiry may wish to
return to in Phase 5, but I intend instead today
to provide an update on developments since

BEIS's announcement on 6 October that, as of
14

sent to applicants in the next week or so, once
identification and verification checks are also
complete. 27 of the late applications, are
partially complete and we are contacting
applicants for missing information.

Sir, one of the other key conclusions in the
progress update was that any applicant whose
claim is rejected by reason of having been made
after 27 November 2020, should have the right to
have that decision reviewed by the Independent
Advisory Panel, and the scheme amended to make
that clear.

Now, the website for the scheme confirms
that applicants are asked to explain why they
were unable to submit an application by the
November 2020 date, provides, by way of example,
they didn't know about the scheme, were poorly,
overseas, caring for a relative.

Post Office has recently updated the
question and answers on the website to clarify
the approach to be taken in circumstances where
a late applicant has provisionally been declined
by Post Office, on the basis that they've not
provided a sufficient reason for missing the

original deadline. Such applicants will be

presented with a further opportunity to provide
one, and Post Office will suggest a list of the
reasons that might apply, in their cases.

If an applicant still cannot provide
a reason or their reason isn't, for whatever
reason, accepted by Post Office, it will let
them know and the matter will be referred to
an independent third party for a final decision.

Post Office considers that this will provide
the requisite independence for determining the
issue, but without adding to the workload of the
Independent Advisory Panel and, therefore,
risking slowing down its consideration of other
substantive claims.

To date, no applications have been
provisionally declined by Post Office, on the
basis that the applicant hasn't provided
a sufficient reason.

In the light of the revised Q&A document,
the Post Office expects there will be very few,
if any, applications deemed to be ineligible on
the grounds of absence of a reason for lateness
alone.

SIR WYN WILLIAMS: If that is the case — and

obviously I accept what you tell me,

current approach under the scheme to processing
applications that were made by late applicants,
and it was suggested that would be subject to
ensuring any such variations but not result in

any less fair a process.

Having considered the issue further, I can
confirm that Post Office has no intention to
introduce any variations in this respect. Late
applications which are accepted as eligible will
be processed in exactly the same way as those
received prior to the November 2020 deadline.

Can I turn to the subject of legal advice
and assistance? Again, in line with your
recommendation, sir, as I explained in our
opening statement, with effect from 10 October
of this year, Post Office has been offering to
pay the reasonable legal costs of the remaining
applicants in the scheme, whose claims are of
a higher value and more complex than those which
were previously settled.

Since that date, Post Office has invited
applicants, who consider they may require
additional support, to discuss and ultimately,
we hope, agree the position with them.

We hope that this ensures that applicants

Ms Gallafent -- doesn't this seem a great
rigmarole to go through, going back and forth
about reasons as to why they haven't applied in
time, when the reality is going to be that

they'll be accepted?

MS GALLAFENT: Sir, I wouldn't anticipate it as
a great rigmarole; it may be a sentence added to
the application form.

SIR WYN WILLIAMS: The time is important in this
‘case and I am anxious to avoid unnecessary
bureaucracy. Anyway, there we are.

MS GALLAFENT: Of course, sir. Your recommendation
or, as it were, key conclusion was that there
should be an independent person to review, if
required. That we have accepted or put in

SIR WYN WILLIAMS: But that was on the basis there

there's nothing to be a fight over it then -

may obtain the assistance they require in
confidence that Post Office will pay those
reasonable legal costs

But since 10 October of this year, there
have been 29 requests received for legal fees.
Post Office has endeavoured to work through
those fee requests as quickly as it can, to
avoid delay in processing applications and with
a view to establishing a more standardised, and
therefore quicker and easier, basis for cost
claims going forward.

As of yesterday, agreement has been reached
with Hudgell Solicitors on initial sample cases,
as well as a general process for assessing the
reasonableness of the costs. It is hoped that
agreement can similarly be reached quickly on
the applications received from other
representatives.

The next key conclusion I propose to address
is interim payments. I indicated in our opening
submissions in October that Post Office would be
keeping under review the issue of whether it
should reconsider its policy on interim payments
and it has now done so.

As recently announced on its website, to

claims, and the total value of those offers --
and these, of course, figures exclude the ten
ENE claimants ~- is approximately £4.23 million
Again, that excludes the value of the offers of

interim payments already made in the same cases.

Of those 33, offers have been accepted in
26 of those claims.

Payments have already been made in 19 of
those claims, within the agreed payment terms of
28 days from receipt of signed acceptance
letters. I'd emphasise, in practice, Post
Office endeavours to pay much quicker than this
timescale, usually around ten days if possible.

Of the other seven, four are scheduled for
payment today and payment for the other three,
and those acceptances were only received on 5 or
6 December; payment will be made as soon as
practicable.

Post Office has now made a total value of
approximately £3.1 million, by way of final
compensation, again excluding offers of interim
payments made in those same cases.

The remaining ten claims, in which offers
had not yet been made, were only received at the

end of last month, they are under assessment by
29

historical matters section of its website to
make it clear that it will seek to finalise
compensation that is over and above the interim
payments of up to £163,000, for personal or
non-pecuniary damages at the earliest possible
opportunity, whilst awaiting claims or

finalising settlements in relation to pecuniary
aspects of a claim. This to ensure that payment
of compensation is not unnecessarily delayed.

Can I pause here to return to the issue of
bankruptcy, which has been raised by several of
the postmaster representatives. The
difficulties that that issue gave rise to in the
overtumed historical convictions context, has
been considered at a high level within Post
Office, discussed with BEIS, discussed with His
Majesty's Treasury. It is hoped a position will
be reached early in the New Year.

Those representing postmasters in these
cases will know that Post Office’s position is
that there is no justification for delaying the
settlement of non-pecuniary losses in order to
consider estates’ potential claims. We will
obviously, sir, update the Inquiry, as soon as

we have any developments in this respect.

Post Office with the intention of issuing offers
before Christmas.

Post Office expects to receive three further
potential non-pecuniary claims by the end of
this year; assuming that is the case, is on
track to have made offers in those by the end of
the year or, if claims arrive later than
expected, early January of next year.

Together with UKGI and BEIS, it is working
hard to see that this is accomplished and,
again, we would like to take this opportunity to
reiterate Post Office's encouragement to all
potential claimants to come forward with their
claims as soon as possible.

As we explained in our opening statement,
Post Office will of more help and support to any
claimants with overtumed convictions who do not
currently have the benefit of legal
representation, to ensure they're aware of the
opportunity to take their non-pecuniary claims
forward on an expedited basis and are aware of
what they need to do so.

In addition, I'd like to flag up one further
development in relation to non-pecuniary

damages. Post Office recently updated the

SIR WYN WILLIAMS: As far as you were aware, are
there points of legal principle, in respect of
persons who have been made bankrupt, who are
either discharged or undischarged, which are
standing in the way, so to speak, of progress,

proving difficult?

MS GALLAFENT: Opinions differ, and there is one, as.
I understand it, estate which takes a different
view to the views taken by others. So we hope
to make some progress in respect of coming to
an agreed position. So there is a legal
dispute, not with Post Office — we've made our
position clear -- but there is a legal dispute.

SIR WYN WILLIAMS: There is a legal dispute?

MS GALLAFENT: Yes, there is. But, as I've
indicated, we hope to make progress relatively
rapidly in that respect.

SIR WYN WILLIAMS: Well, I'm only musing aloud but
I might take my own legal advice about this.

could be challenged, that process, including the
Post Office working together with the CCRC, has
already been underway for many months and will
now be firmly supported by the role to be played
by Citizens Advice.

In conclusion, having regard to the progress
set out in our written submissions and I hope
highlighted in my oral submissions today,
against the key conclusions in your progress
update, insofar as Post Office has
responsibility for those matters, it is our
respectful submission that such progress could
not reasonably be characterised as too slow in
all the circumstances, such as to justify
delivering an interim report to the Minister

containing specific recommendations.
Post Office does, of course, though, welcome
any further views or guidance you may have and,
of course, we stand ready to provide search
updates on compensation issues as the Inquiry
may find of assistance as the hearings progress.
Can I just make two further points. The
first is
SIR WYN WILLIAMS: Before you do that, while it's in

my mind, going back to people who have been
37

straight to the Court of Appeal is the quickest
way.

SIR WYN WILLIAMS: Right. Well, if I found
difficulty in getting that squarely in my head,
it may not be surprising that many other people
find the same difficulty.

MR MOLONEY: Including me, sir.

MS GALLAFENT: The first was I was going to pick
up ~ very helpfully my solicitor has indicated,
you asked, sir, about the number of applications
in which insolvency or bankruptcy issues have
arisen. As of 6 December, there are 72
applications in the Historical Shortfall Scheme,
in which either the Post Office understands the
course of action rests in the insolvency
bankruptcy or practitioner, or it's currently
unclear whether or not it does. Work is ongoing
to establish where it sits. That includes the
19 applications in which offers have been made.

In addition, there are approximately ten of
the 30 dissolved company applications which may
be impacted by insolvency or bankruptcy issues.
Again, the processing of those applications is
ongoing.

Sir, I sense a keen interest on behalf of

convicted but who haven't yet engaged with
trying to get their conviction overtumed, am
I right in thinking that the Criminal Cases
Review Commission may not be the quickest and
suggest route, especially for those who have
never appealed before? In other words, if you
were convicted in, shall we say, 2010, for the
sake of argument, you didn't appeal, presumably
the quickest route now is simply to apply out of
time for the leave to appeal to the Court of
Appeal, without involving the Criminal Cases
Review Commission, provided, of course, you can
bring yourself within the terms of the Hamilton
judgment.

MS GALLAFENT: I'l defer to Mr Moloney but
I understand that to be the case.

SIR WYN WILLIAMS: Is that right, Mr Moloney, or
have I set a hare running?

MR MOLONEY: No, sir, you're absolutely right. It's
the involvement of the Criminal Cases Review
Commission in alerting people to the possibility
of appeal, whether by way of the CCRC, if
they've had a previous appeal, or they were
convicted in the Magistrates Court, which the

CCRC are were dealing with. Otherwise then
38

all postmasters and, sir, you as well we will
certainly seek to update I think on perhaps
a proactive basis without waiting to be invited,
how things go in relation to insolvency and
bankruptcy issues, in both the OHC and the HSS
context.

SIR WYN WILLIAMS: It’s just the feeling I've got
that this seems to be quite a difficult
problem —

MS GALLAFENT: Yes.

SIR WYN WILLIAMS: — and we want to solve it.

MS GALLAFENT: We also share that.

SIR WYN WILLIAMS: I was using "we" in every sense
of the word "we".

MS GALLAFENT: Absolutely, I'm very grateful.

Sir, just one further matter, if I may, on

the subject of restorative justice. Post Office
notes the points made by Howe+Co on restorative
justice in their written submissions. They

rightly recognise this is not a compensation

issue and, as such, we say it doesn't properly

fall within the scope of today's hearing but,
nevertheless, we'd wish to make two points in

this context.

The first is that Post Office does not

consider that its offer, which I made, sir, you
may remember, in my oral opening submissions,
for senior members of Post Office to meet
directly with affected postmasters in order to
listen to them and make suitable apologies,
requires the establishment of a formal scheme or
process, necessitating the involvement of
solicitors on either side.

It's approach to arranging meetings will be
flexible and sympathetic to those affected and
supported by the existing dispute resolution
team, who already support applicants to the HSS,
many of whom are former post masters themselves.

The second point is that Post Office's offer
reflected exactly what was requested on behalf
of the Core Participants represented by Howe+Co
in their opening oral submissions. What we
understand now to be proposed in their written
submissions is that, in the absence of Post
Office and BEIS agreeing to establish what they
would describe as a restorative justice fund,
you, sure, should make a formal recommendation
of the establishment of such a process and
funding.

Sir, of course, that goes well beyond the

The Department wishes to begin by
reiterating its commitment to ensuring
subpostmasters receive full and fair
compensation as quickly as possible, and this
remains a key ministerial priority. As the
Department said it would at the July hearings,

it has listened to the concerns about
compensation arrangements, engaged with them,
and taken action where necessary.

Whilst there will always be room for
improvement and much work remains to be done,
the Department believes that the general
trajectory is now broadly positive but, as
always, it would welcome your views. ll
address each of the three compensation schemes
in turn, starting with the Post Office
administered schemes, the Historical Shortfall
Scheme and the Overtumed Historical Conviction
scheme before turning to the BEIS scheme, the
Group Litigation Scheme.

previous indication of what was sought in this
context, and I venture to say it's equally
a matter that would appear to go beyond the
scope of the terms of reference of this Inquiry.
Can I just look to my left and right to
confirm if there's anything further that I need
to-
Thank you very much indeed, sir, for that
opportunity. I may have strayed a few minutes
past my time but I'm very grateful.
SIR WYN WILLIAMS: I think you are well within
a margin of appreciation, to use a phrase we're
no longer allowed to use.

Department has some levers of influence, and it
has not shied away from using them where
necessary. As you know, the Department has
encouraged POL to speed up the HSS process, and
set POL the target of issuing offers to all HSS
claimants by the end of this year.

As you noted in your progress update, that
was an ambitious target, intentionally so, and
with some regret, the Department recognises that
POL will not meet it.

Even so, POL has been making relatively good
progress and the Department's clear expectation
is that offers will have been made in most of
the remaining cases by the end of January.

Once a formal proposal concerning late
applications was made by POL, the Department
worked diligently to arrange and confirm the
substantial additional public funding required.

It welcomes POL's confirmation that applications
following the scheme’s closure will be accepted,
provided that a sufficient reason for the

failure to make the application within the

window is given, and it also welcomes the
confirmation of the role of an independent

review in case of disagreement.

The Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry 8 December 2022

SIR WYN WILLIAMS: Mr Chapman, I'm a bit it confused
now, because I think Ms Gallafent was more or
less agreeing with me that they were going to be
accepted. You put it in a much more guarded way
and I'd hate there to be any divergence between
BEIS and POL over this.

MR CHAPMAN: I don't think that there's any
divergence at all

SIR WYN WILLIAMS: So I shall carefully note what
Ms Gallafent said and proceed on that basis,
shall I?

MR CHAPMAN: I think that’s fair.

SIR WYN WILLIAMS: Good.

MR CHAPMAN: The Department is very pleased to note
that the previous cap on reasonable legal
expenses has been removed, with POL reimbursing
all reasonable legal costs, both at the offer
stage and for claimants going into the dispute
resolution process.

Finally, on the HSS, the Department welcomes
the development that POL has made provision for
interim payments, irrespective of personal
circumstances and in addition to hardship
payments.

Turning to the Overturned Historical
45

made a statement in Parliament yesterday to
announce the shape of the scheme, following, as
promised, consultation with the GLO claimants
and their representatives.

In line with the views of the substantial
majority of those who responded, the scheme will
follow an ADR model, and will be administered
directly by BEIS, not POL.

The scheme will be overseen by
an independent advisory board, which will be
chaired by Professor Christopher Hodges,
an academic who is an expert in ADR matters, and
its membership will include Lord Arbuthnot and
the Right Honourable Kevan Jones MP, both of
whom have long and distinguished records as
campaigners for the postmasters.

The claims themselves will be considered and
assessed by an independent panel. The
expectation is that the full compensation awards
will begin before the summer, with most cases
being resolved by the end of next year. The
Department has now invited claimants and their
legal representatives to begin preparation of
claims and has announced support for claimants’

initial legal costs: the costs of first
47

ONOneRwON a

Convictions compensation, the Department is
reasonably pleased at the progress being made,
as just described by Ms Gallafent, though

clearly there remains some way to go. It

welcomes the positive progress being made on the
non-pecuniary damages claims and it welcomes the
increase to the ceiling for interim payments,
including the top-ups for those who received

interim payments previously.

Can I just add this: the Department is very
conscious of the practical hurdles facing
subpostmasters in making pecuniary damages
claims and, in order to help facilitate the
process, the Department has worked with HMRC to
enable easier access to historic tax return
data, so that claimants can particularise their
claims with confidence. The Department
encourages postmasters and their representatives
to bring forward their claims as soon as they
are able to.

Tuming to the Group Litigation Scheme,
unlike the other two schemes, the Group
Litigation Scheme is being set up by BEIS and,
as one would hope, reasonably good progress is

being made. As you know, the Chief Secretary

‘engagement with lawyers.

SIR WYN WILLIAMS: That hasn't been met with
universal approval that, has it?

MR CHAPMAN: It hasn't. The amount is specifically
for initial engagement with lawyers and
arrangements of payments of reasonable legal
costs, beyond initial engagement and the costs,
indeed, of acquiring expert evidence, where
necessary, are being finalised

SIR WYN WILLIAMS: I appreciate that there will be
a need to work out rates of pay, putting it
loosely, but the phrase that had been used
consistently was "reasonable legal expenses’, in
previous announcements.

MR CHAPMAN: Can I be clear, sir, that it remains
the Department's position that postmasters
engaging in this scheme will be entitled to
recover reasonable legal expenses.

in the meantime, the Department has made
interim payments totalling over £16 million so
far, and covering 85 or over 85 per cent of
claimants.

It, of course, understands that interim
payments are really important, and especially so

for some GLO claimants. It continues its
48

(12) Pages 45 - 48

The Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry

concerted work to resolve issues concerning
interim payments where they haven't already been
made. In relation to the 16 bankrupt GLO
claimants, who have not yet received an interim
payment, you've heard about the issues with one
insolvency practitioner in particular, which the
Department is seeking to resolve as soon as
possible.

We would encourage you, sir, to follow up on
your suggestion that you might take your own
legal advice on that issue, and we would be very
happy to set out in a little more particular
detail what precisely that issue is, in writing,
if that would be helpful.

SIR WYN WILLIAMS: Well, I think if I do decide that
it's appropriate for me to take legal advice,
I would probably ask my legal team to engage
with all the relevant lawyers as to the
appropriate questions to ask.
MR CHAPMAN: Yes, we'd certainly be happy to engage
in that process.

It may prove to be the case — it is hoped
that itll prove to be the case -- that it's
possible to resolve that issue, and to resolve

it shortly.
49

MR CHAPMAN: Yeah. I hope that addresses it.

SIR WYN WILLIAMS: Yes.

MR CHAPMAN: Can I briefly turn to a couple of other
related matters.

First, the Department is very pleased to
note that POL is committed to setting up
a compensation scheme to cover lost remuneration
caused by suspension and, indeed, any
consequential losses. The Government has
committed to providing the funding to the Post
Office to cover those payments and the
Department will oversee the process to ensure
it's delivered promptly.

The second point: the Government has
committed to legislating, at the earliest
opportunity, to exclude all Post Office and
Horizon related compensation payments from the
calculation of capital limits for means-tested
benefits and pension credits.

That is in addition to the announcement made
in September that no tax will be payable on
compensation payments made under the OHC scheme.

So to conclude, the Department believes that
compensation issues are now generally

progressing fairly well, but it would of course

SIR WYN WILLIAMS: The quicker you do it, the less

SIR WYN WILLIAMS: Yes.

MR CHAPMAN: {fit isn’t looking likely to resolve
it very quickly, then the Department will make
partial interim payments, which will not cause
the potential problems which full payments, full
interim payments might cause within the next
week.

Finally, most GLO members who were acquitted
of Horizon offences have already received more
in compensation than the £100,000 interim
payments which have been made to those who were
convicted. However, the Department has
recognised the force of the concer that you
raised in relation to the handful of GLO members
who are not in that position. They will receive
additional interim payments under the GLO
scheme, rather than being transferred to the

£8,000 is intended to compensate him for his
distress, the rest is for the Official Receiver
because of property related matters. That's the
division that's being made, so far as damages

are concerned: personal damages, as it were, for
the claimant; property damages for the Official
Receiver.

Then the second case, Case 5, we've referred
to it as, out of an award of £24,999.32, the
applicant has been offered £4,500 whilst the
Official Receiver is to receive £20,400.32. The
Official Receiver has no authority, other than
to settle the debts of the bankruptcy in full,
and with the compensatory interest applying, the
likelihood is that any award for financial
losses will very often be completely swallowed
up when those debts are paid, and the issues
surrounding bankruptcy are often complex and
frequently require specialist legal assistance.

As currently appears to Hudgell Solicitors,
the HSS takes no account of whether the root
cause of bankruptcy was or may have been
shortfalls generated by Horizon software and
compensation is intended to put the claimant in

the position they would have been in, if they'd
61

correct me when I inevitably get this wrong but,
essentially, those offers would not have been
accepted but they are merely illustrative of the
division of the award, as it were, and —

SIR WYN WILLIAMS: So it's designed to persuade me,
if I needed persuasion, that there could be
a very significant amount of money at stake for
the individual involved on this bankruptcy
issue?

MR MOLONEY: That's it, sir.

SIR WYN WILLIAMS: Right, okay.

MR MOLONEY: Also, sir, just to elaborate upon that
point very briefly if I may, that, of course,
the purpose ~ and underlying that submission,
is, of course, that the purpose of compensation
is to attempt to put the person back in the
position that they would have been but for the
unreliable operation of Horizon software. So
many of the debts which were accrued by this
person, in the first place, which led to
bankruptcy, were caused by the shortfalls before
that and then the way their business then
collapsed and then, of course, people have
mortgage payments.

It's that litany, sir, that you've heard so

not been adversely affected by the unreliable of
Horizon.
So, sorry, sir —

SIR WYN WILLIAMS: I was just, as you were speaking,

80 I'll ask you now ~ and if it's embarrassing

in any way to answer, then please say so ~ but
are these figures that you've mentioned, in
terms of the offer under the HSS, would they
have been acceptable as figures, if I can put it
in that way? Forget the split between the
Official Receiver —

MR MOLONEY: I've not had conduct of the cases, sir,

but ~

‘SIR WYN WILLIAMS: No, but what I'm trying to

establish, essentially, is whether these
figures -- if you remove the trustee for the
moment — would have been acceptable. That's
point number 1. If they're not, then there's

an ongoing issue under the HSS. If they would
have been acceptable, I imagine there's now
an ongoing dispute as to whether all this money
should be paid over to the Official Receiver.

So there are two aspects to it. That's what I'm
trying to get at.

MR MOLONEY: Indeed, sir, and Dr Hudgell will

62

many times during the course of the impact
hearings. With this outcome, what happens is
that all of the debts that they accrued, all of

the debts that led to the bankruptcy, whilst
essentially there's a compensation award given

to them, that gets swallowed up by the debtors,
rather than them, so they're not being put back
into the position that they would have been but

for the unreliable operation of the Horizon
software.

They're being left with, in Case 4, £8,000,
when, even on the assessment of the HSS, they
should have got £259,000.

Sir, we did make a point about the agreement
of reasonable costs but there's been progress in
relation to that, and we say nothing further
about that.

Then, finally, we've made a point about the
provision of medical assistance, assistance for
the commission of medical reports, and about how
that has not really been available in the
experience of Hudgell Solicitors, and Hudgell
Solicitors understand there is a need to deal
with claims expeditiously. The commissioning of

a medical report may delay the making of a first

and still no substantive response to any of the
claims.

We hope that there will be a response to the
claims very soon and the reason for the delay in
Post Office making proposals for settlement is
not known to Hudgell Solicitors.

We had hoped and expected that the initial
six claims would provide an adequate and
appropriate framework for the process of the
remaining claims, in essence, a sort of parallel
to the early neutral evaluation process. But
the delay of months has meant that that
expectation hasn't materialised but there is
will on both sides for that to happen with these
cases and we hope that we will be able to
resolve that very soon.

In addition to difficulties encountered by
some bankrupt claimants under the HSS scheme
that we've referred to, problems have also
recently arisen in the Overturned Historical
Conviction cases in which bankruptcy is
a feature.

It's fine with those cases which fall under
the auspices of the Official Receiver; we've

managed to resolve that, with the Official
69

details if I were to say now, but we would be
happy to assist in any way we can, sir.

But it is the same principle in this way,
sir, that this compensation is designed to put
people in the place they would have been if they
hadn't suffered and, in particular, in these
cases, they hadn't been prosecuted and
convicted.

So that's what this compensation should try
and achieve and, plainly, if a large portion of
the damages is being taken from them, in the
same way that it is with the HSS, then that is
obviously significant injustice, we'd say, and
that, essentially, Post Office — if the
bankruptcies were caused by the actions in the
first place, it's incumbent on them to do all it
can to ensure that these people are put in the
position they would have been in but for the
unreliability of the Horizon software.

SIR WYN WILLIAMS: I'm not sure to what extent
I can, in truth, delve into these matters, but
since I'm having a bit of a go this morning, it
seems to me there's almost two different issues.
One is your assertion based on what BEIS and

Post Office have said, that there should be full

1 Receiver indicating that they've no further
2 interest. But, as you've heard from Mr Chapman,
3 there are three other cases where they are being
4 dealt with by a different insolvency

5 practitioner.

6 Two of those people are Noel Thomas and

7 David Blakey, and the insolvency practitioner

8 initially relinquished any interest but then,

9 following advice from King's Counsel, they've
10 now claimed an interest in part of the damages,
"1 and this has held up payment of damages for
12 non-pecuniary losses.

1 and fair compensation. Which is another way of
2 saying you should be put back into the position
3 if this had never happened to you.
4 On the other hand, there's the legal
5 position of a person who has been made bankrupt
6 to his trustee in bankruptcy, or her trustee in
7 bankruptcy. It's that latter point, I think,
8 that BEIS and POL were inviting me to dip my oar
9 in, so to speak, not the former point, if I can
10 put it in that way. What do you think about
"1 those issues, Mr Moloney?
12 MRMOLONEY: Sir, one solution, which might not be
13 attractive to BEIS and POL, is that the actual
14 level of compensation paid is increased so that
15 the debtors that are required to be satisfied by
16 the Official Receiver or the insolvency
17 practitioners can be paid, and the postmasters
18 can be put in the position that they would have
19 been in, but for the unreliability. That seems
20 to us to be the most straightforward way: that
21 both are taken care of.

a reopening of those awards, given the
penetrating analysis on behalf of Hudgells by

Mr Moloney about how the unrepresented can be,

again, taken advantage of.

So it is shameful, embarrassing and beyond
comprehension that those exemplars put before
you by Mr Moloney actually happened before
lawyers came in to resolve the matter. One asks
“Why is it so difficult? Why does it take so
ong to act with integrity?"

Why does it take so long to do the right
thing, particularly since these people were
subjugated, they were victims of effectively
state power, an agency or public corporation
that oppressed them, criminalised them, when
they'd served that institution with loyalty,
with kindness to their customers and with
integrity, and yet they were degraded in that
way and deprived of the means to clear their
names.

Itall started, even before the very
beginning. First, they were sloppy, they were
slow, they were incompetent. It was all their
fault. Then, of course, for that 1 per cent or

less who were subject to those latent bugs,
93

of this malignant culture of secrecy and
non-disclosure.

Those two questions, unanswered, will
continue to hang over the head of those who
represent the Post Office but, more importantly,
those who are the directing mind of the Post
Office. It is a profound shame to this country,
that, even after all that has been done wrong,
that silence, even today, persists

Those are our submissions, sir.

SIR WYN WILLIAMS: Can I just be clear that I've got

Mr Parekh fall to be compensated under the

errors and defects, and the remote tampering
with the system, they were lying, dishonest
thieves, and yet year on year, as this
irrefutable evidence built up, it was covered
up, it was buried and, with it, the Post Office
realised that they were burying them.

In conclusion, sir, if that is not taken
into account, and if that is not amply and
properly recognised and factored in to the
awards that are to be made, then this whole
compensation scheme or schemes will not be fit
for purpose.

This not benevolence, this not Lady

people to the position that they would have been
and might have been, what they would have
achieved -- a bright 19-year old, Tracy
Felstead, who lost her entire adult life through
the Post Office's malevolence.

So you can't just give them a sort of
mechanical or merely functional sum, based on
a box-ticking exercise. There has to be

potential, the assets that they lost and the

opportunities that they were denied, all because

throughout this Inquiry.

As you know, I represent, briefed by Howe+Co
solicitors, 156 Core Participants, as well as
supporting applications being made by other
subpostmasters, mistresses and managers within
the scheme.

Sir, one of the advantages, perhaps, of
going last today, not that I can just therefore
take the entire afternoon that's left, but —

SIR WYN WILLIAMS: You certainly cannot!

MR STEIN: -- one of the advantages is this: it's,
allowed us time to consider the various emails
and contacts that we've had from clients that we
represent, because they have been listening, now
that the live feed has been restored, and they
have been taking account of what has been said
by all of the parties who have made submissions
before you.

‘The summary answer from our client group as
to what they have heard, rather sadly, is they
hear that next week or in the New Year that
things are going to happen, that schemes will
change, that there will be something being done
about funding, there will be something being

done about individual compensation claims.
97

members, the litigation group members. What we
see as lacking in relation to the compensation
schemes variously being discussed today is

a lack of controlling mind, lack of cohesion,

lack of intelligence, being placed into these
schemes across the board

We shouldn't be in a situation whereby,
essentially, there are different choices and
different types of systems being put forward in
relation to people that have essentially the
same issues as subpostmasters, mistresses and
managers.

Of course we represent people who are right
now hurting. These are people who are finding
it very difficult and it’s irresistible to say
that we are looking towards a Christmas break or
holiday break, whereby people are thinking about
how they can finance that and how they can
manage through that period.

Now, the truth here is that the Post Office
has fought and fought and fought to prevent the
truth coming out, and against the fair provision
of compensation, to those that have been harmed
by this most public of IT scandals. My

instructing solicitors, Howe+Co, have worked
99

1 So, as an example, Sinead Rainey, who has
2 been mentioned today by Ms Gallafent, her

3 particular position is one that is very

4 difficult. She wasn't in fact, if you like, the

5 subpostmaster but she acted as in the position

6 of the subpostmaster, and that was recognised at
7 the time because the Post Office pursued a debt
8

against her.
9 Now, we hear today that her position will be
10 addressed in the next few weeks.
"1 So the difficulty that our client group has,
12 in the responses that we've had so far today, is
13 that they only hear "Delay, sometime later,
14 something will happen". They don't hear that,
15 work is ongoing. They don't hear about what has
16 happened in the background.
7 So, sadly, sir, we suggest that the product
18 of what we have had today, through the
19 compensation hearing that you arranged as part
20 of this Inquiry, has been, of course, useful but
21 not enough.
22 Yesterday, we saw a product arising out of
23 a lack of controlling mind across these
24 compensation schemes. We had served upon us in
25 the afternoon the proposed scheme for GLO.

98
1 tirelessly with campaigners to shame the Post
2 Office into recognise something that they must
3 compensate subpostmasters.
4 Regarding compensation, the standout issue
5 that has bedevilled the provision of timely
6 ‘compensation for those that have suffered so
7 much at the hands of the Post Office and BEIS
8 has been the failure to make provision for
9 reasonable financial costs of claimants, so that
10 they can have legal advice and representation.
"1 Sir, we're not just talking about a couple
12 of people who need help. These are hundreds of
13 subpostmasters with complex, compound claims
14 that can only be assessed and presented with the
15 support of expert solicitors with experience in
16 difficult compensation cases.
17 It seems to us and those we represent that
18 the Post Office and BEIS seek to wind back the
19 clock and pretend, like Bobby Ewing returning
20 from the dead in Dallas, from one episode to the
21 next, that it was all a bad dream.
22 Sir, 'm sure you remember Dallas very well
23 The Horizon System was defective.

our written submissions, how restorative justice
might look, including such an idea as

an entrepreneur's fund and bursaries for the
families of subpostmasters. Our clients’ lives
have been torn apart. They started businesses
that they expected to see them through into

their retirement, looking after their families,
children that would have been brought up within
subpostmaster branches and offices, where they'd
been learning the value of small businesses,
often torn apart by the actions of the Post

Office.

Restorative justice is also about making
sure that, in this particular matter, that the
Post Office has actually learned lessons, and so
far, rather sadly, it seems that the Post Office
has not even started at school.

So enough is enough, sir. We suggest that
there is a need for an interim report under
Section 24.3 of the Inquiry Act and, sir, we ask
you to carry through the suggestion you made
that you made that you may do.

Sir, two last points. We ask that the
process of compensation hearings in this Inquiry

continues. We know it seems that it's the only
133

So there is a process and it doesn't involve
the CCRC.

Sir, forgive me for one moment. (Pause)
Sir, nothing else. Thank you, sir.

SIR WYN WILLIAMS: Thank you. Right. Well, I think
that concludes the oral submissions to
supplement the written submissions that I've
received. I will go away and think about them,
and decide what to do about them. So there we
are.

way to make sure that anything is done and
I join with Mr Moloney in his submissions, which

is to ask the Inquiry to ensure that it is able

to continue oversight, in these individual

hearings, of the compensation process as we move
forward.

Second point: you've dealt with this largely
by discussing matters with Mr Moloney regarding
convictions and the progress of matters being
dealt with at the Court of Appeal and I agree
entirely with what he said. ll just add one
small point.

The way the Court of Appeal is dealing with
matters, sir, for your information, is that when
subpostmasters or individuals come to them who
are caught within this particular scandal, the
Court of Appeal registrars’ office is contacting
solicitors that have acted on behalf of those
individuals in the past and are ensuring that
they have representation, and we then go through
the process -- either Mr Moloney or myself or
our teams -- of considering the information,
advising as to whether there is, in fact,

a potential for the appeal to go further, and
then putting forward grounds.
