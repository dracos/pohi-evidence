Attachments: Draft respponse to CRR - M081 (RW 30.06.15).docx

Martin,

It is clear following our con last week with Brian Altman that week are not going to have bottomed out the possible
disclosure around the “Balancing Transaction” function in the immediate future given the questions we need Fujitsu to
answer. However, we cannot delay the progress of the M081 case (or indeed any other case) in the interim.

i have therefore attempted to blend our existing Remote Access/Balancing Transaction statements (principally taken
from our Part Two Response) with Simon’s Disclosure Note in POL’s comments on Second Sight’s CRR for MO81
{attached}, in a way which strives to be consistent with what has previously been said and what might be disclosed
{based on our current knowledge) in the criminal law context.

Can you please therefore look at the attached draft response and let me know if you and/or Simon are happy with the
drafting. if not, please provide your amendments.

l repeat we cannot delay releasing this response to Second Sight any longer. Please therefore come back to me during
the course of tomorrow.

I have copied Andy Parsons in so that he can progress the rest of the clearance once we have received your views.

Kind regards, Rodric

Rodric,

I have had an opportunity to discuss this with Simon today.

POL-0061913
POL00065434
POL00065434

Whilst the collation of this data will of course be of assistance, the Disclosure Note which Simon will
prepare will contain the information necessary for POL to discharge its disclosure obligations post-
conviction.

It seems to me that the starting point should be Simon’s Disclosure Note and once that has been
settled, it should be easier to plan the route ahead.

Kind regards,

Martin.

Martin —I need a reply to this please. It will certainly inform the approach we take to the BBC’s questions on remote
access and disclosure in prosecution cases.

To assist, I attach a document containing the language we have used on remote access, Please forward this to Simon if
necessary.

Thanks

All — here’s my proposal for stopping the “drift”:

The current block to progressing claims through the Scheme is ensuring consistency in our statements on balancing
transactions between what we:

have already said publicly (POL’s Part Two Response);

have already said in individual cases (the CRR responses);

are going to say in individual cases {in particular the pending CRR responses for M137 and M081); and
are going to say so as to comply with our continuing duty of disclosure in criminal cases.

The most sensitive point is (4). I understand Simon is pulling together a list of cases where disclosure is required, looking
at what we have already said publicly (1), then draft a suitable disclosure note (4) which ideally ties into the public
disclosures.

However, that might take some time during which we need to keep moving cases through the Scheme (3).

To keep the individual Scheme cases moving, I suggest Simon looks at what we have already said (1 and 2) to confirm
whether or not that is sufficient for criminal disclosure purposes. If so, we will be able to provide a consistent position
going forward in both the CRRs (3) and criminal disclosure (4), because both will simply be referring to the same public
statement (1). In that regard, I note Dan Fawcett has advised that our CRR response for M137 as currently drafted is
consistent with POL’s Part Two Response.

It should be relatively easy to provide 1 and 2 to Simon, as as far as I am aware (but please correct me if i’m wrong} we

have only publicly discussed balancing transactions in our Part Two Response, and used stock language when
commenting on individual CRRs (which language has already been the subject of a discussion between BD, CK and POL).

Andy — can you have someone pull together the balancing transaction language we have used to date asap?
Simon/Martin — can you let me know whether you are happy with this approach?

Kind regards, Rodric

Martin, Rod, Andy

Could I ask for an update please ?

This is one of those cases which is drifting and I would very much like to close it down before it drifts any further.
Many thanks

Rodric,
Following our meeting it occurred to me that there were two options here:-
1. Given the wider PR issues which will be of concern to POL and BD, it may be best for BD to
redraft the CRR Response before resubmitting it to us;
2. Await the Disclosure Note which Simon Clarke will draft to ensure that anything said ina
CRR response is consistent;

There may be a third option, namely a combination of the two.

Kind regards,

I regret that it will not be possible for us to respond to this prior to the end of the day. As in the case
of Misra M012, there are a number of issues which will require very careful consideration, and
possibly a conference call next week.

Kind regards,

Martin.

Martin,
Please find attached the CRR for M081 and the draft response. In addition to providing your usual review, can you have a
look at paragraphs 1.9 and 2.2 in particular where they SS refer to the theft charge being "dropped" — I seem to recall

from other matters this was not the correct wording.

The response is due to go by close today so can you let me know if it will not be possible for someone to look at this
before the end of the day?

Best regards
