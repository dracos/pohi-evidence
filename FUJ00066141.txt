It now think I see the problem.
Ithe original MiECCO unpaid cheque is in mode RISD. This is not a defined mode
for EPOSS and the Cash Account mappings for product 5 do not have a place
defined for RISD and hence the action is undefined; but ( and I will confirm
this later ) probably use SC serve customer as default which maps it to

stock. If it had been mapped as a ROOP instead then the cash account would
nave balanced.

Following my last analysis I have found some more.

there is a default for transactions defined in the Cash Account; and in this
case it is as stated SC server customer. My statement that ROOP would have
corrected the problem was not correct - I meant RIOP. At CI4 only there is a
collection ProductModes that gives the allowed modes for a given product - we

Ihe cause of this mis balance is down to a migration issue.
the ECCO transaction was for product 5.

ithe mode for this migrated transaction was RISD.

here is no corresponding Horizon RISD. The closest is RIOP.
lwhat Horizon does in these cases is migrate the transaction a:
customer transaction by default

serve

his meant the transaction was migrated correctly as a stock increase (Table
5), but incorrectly migrated as a sale of product 5.

fhe net effect of this is that the transaction was reported twice to the
payments table in table 1085, and as a “sale” of 5 which increased cash.

this caused the Cash account to misbalance by 2 * £200.00 = £400.00
