Anne,

If you OK with being mentioned so prominently in the email, then I am happy with it in principle.

I am not comfortable with the wording of the last paragraph, which reads

"We do have a possible mitigation for the timing problem as identified in the 2 cases of an accounting problem being
generated. However given the fact that the accounting problem has only occurred twice in two years we were of the
opinion that the risk of attempting to fix the problem may well outweigh the benefit of such a fix. This decision is being
reviewed again in light of this action following the normal Fujitsu processes for deciding which problems are worth fixing."

I would recommend that this be changed to.

"We have a possible mitigation for the timing problem which has been identified. However, since there had only been 2
occurrences of the accounting problem in two years, it had been the decision of the Release Management Forum that the
cost of implementing the mitigation would outweigh the potential benefit. This decision will be reviewed in the light of
recent evidence as part of the normal process".

Regards
Mik
