As you will remember JA is hosting a meeting on 8" July where SS are going to present their interim findings to MPs and
JFSA, on 3 MP cases.

We had a call with Second Sight today and have now put in place calls every day from next Tuesday to take us through to
their report being ready.

There are still risks with what the report will say. Not around the System but around the wider issues eg training and
support ( which SS are counting as part of the Horizon operating model)

lam sure there will be enough in the report for JFSA to cause mischief if they want to with the Media , and Ruth is
involved in updating the comms plan.

SS have a call with James on the 2" July and you have a call with him on the 3% and we should know in advance what
the report will say and therefore what they are likely to say to James.

Things will get clearer next week. But my biggest concern at the moment is if the review focuses on training etc. how
JFSA will respond. I think you can make some positive noises to JA on the 3“ including improvements in training and
support and also our idea of a horizon user group made up of existing subpostmaster who use the system.

I will get an update in the diary for us and Lesley on Wednesday next week

Thanks
