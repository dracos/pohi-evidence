WITNESS STATEMENT OF GREGORY JOHN BOOTH

I, GREGORY JOHN BOOTH, o! I WILL SAY AS FOLLOWS:

1. Iam currently the Manager of the Newby Post Office branch, 401 Scalby Road Scarborough. I have
worked at Newby branch for 1 year (the first 6 months as assistant Manager, the last 6 months as
permanent Manager). I have worked in Post Office branches for the past 8 years. I was
subpostmaster of Edgehill branch from October 1998 to September 2003. I was temporary
subpostmaster for Southcliff branch from September 2003 to February 2004. Before working in Post
Office branches, I was an accountant which included working in audit for Coopers and Lybrand (as
PriceWaterhouseCoopers was then known).

2. I make this Witness Statement from facts within my own knowledge unless otherwise stated.
References to page numbers in this Witness statement are to page numbers of Exhibit “GB1” to this

Witness Statement.

3. From 21 April 2004 to 28 May 2004 (just over 5 weeks) I was the temporary subpostmaster at 14
South Marine Drive, Bridlington YO15 3DB (the Marine Drive branch). I was asked by Catherine
Oglesby, then the Retail Line Manager, to be the new temporary subpostmaster because Ruth
Simpson, who was the temporary subpostmaster before me, could not continue in the position any
longer due to other commitments she had.

Assistant

4. Subposmasters decide whether they need to employ an assistant. I employed Joan Train as my part
time assistant whilst I was the temporary subpostmaster at the Marine Drive branch. Joan Train
worked 2 or 3 days per week. As far as I was aware, she had not previously worked at the Marine
drive branch, but had just left another branch in Bridlington on Quay Road.

5. Joan Train was coincidentally the mother in law of Mr Castleton’s assistant Christine Train. Christine

Train had been employed by Mr Castleton to work behind the counter whilst he was subpostmaster,
1A_1207764_3 1 -

41
POL00074091
POL00074091

but whilst I was there, she worked in the shop rather than behind the Post Office counter. Mr
Castleton also worked in the shop.

6. Whilst Joan Train was working and serving customers we would each use a separate computer
terminal. The Marine Drive branch operates as a shared stock unit so all the transactions done on the
two computers are pooled into one shared stock and cash account. During Joan Train‘s days off, if
necessary I would log on to both computer terminals and serve customers from both of them. This
enabled me to deal with large quantities of packages from e-bay customers between serving other

customers.
Cash accounts

7. The Cash Accounts for the period when I worked as a subpostmaster are at pages 1 to 51. In
summary, they show that:

suf
(a) Cash Account week 5, week ended Wednesday 28 April 2004 surplus of £14.26 (page 1);
(b) Cash Account week 6, week ended Wednesday 5 May 2004, surplus £463.11" (bage 7) (1 will
explain the reason for this below); MZ 9 3B2
(c) Cash Account week 7, week ended Wednesday 12 May 2004, £101.21 shortage (page 17) (I will
explain the reason for this below); 3. ps7s
(d) Cash Account week 8, week ended Wednesday 13 May 2004, £1.92 shortage (page 30); and
(e) Cash Account week 9, week ended Wednesday 26 May 2004, £6.63 shortage (page 40).
8, At the time I handed over to Dorothy Day (the relief subpostmaster who followed me) on Friday 28
May 2004, part way through Cash Account week 10, there was a shortage of £1.24.

Suspense account

9. On a number of occasions whilst I was the temporary subpostmaster at the Marine Drive branch, Mr
Castleton, who continued to work in the shop, informed me that he thought that whilst he was
subpostmaster, the suspense account had been “doubling up” the losses. He said that although he
had transferred the shortfall from his Cash Account into the Suspense Account, the system was
showing increasing deficits.

10. Catherine Oglesby contacted me around 5 May 2004 and told me that Mr Castleton had also spoken
to her about the suspense account and she wanted to test whether it was in fact doubling up the
losses. I told her that I was a few pounds over so far that week. Ms Oglesby asked me to print an
office snapshot (pages 53 to 53) which shows that the cash was £41,777.87. She then asked me to
transfer £100 into the shortages line on the suspense account which I did and then to print a second

1939 594 Go? NSS pbal- COE
snapshot (pages 54 to 55) and a suspense account report (pages 56 to 5%). The £100 was in the
correct place and the cash figure had reduced by £100 to £41,665.53 (in fact, it had reduced slightly
more than this due to an unrelated transaction(s) performed before the snapshot was printed). This
appeared to show that the system was working correctly.

11. Ms Oglesby asked me to balance with those amounts still in the account as I should balance £100

over. She said she would then call me a few days later and ask me to transfer the £100 out off the
14 12077643 2 542
POL00074091
POL00074091

suspense account, to see if the opposite occurred. I balanced later that day and left Ms Oglesby a
message on her telephone to confirm that I had balanced £100 over, as expected.

isited me at the Marine Drive branch. She asked me to firstly print an
}), then to remove the £100 from the suspense account which I did,

12. On 7 May 2004 Ms Oglesby
office snapshot (pages 58 te
then to print a second snapshot ' (pages 60 to 61) and a suspense account Fepbrt I (pages 62 to 63).
Again the cash figure in the snapshot had changed by £100 which suggested that the system worked

correctly.

13. The, reason that there was a £103.11 surplus in the Cash Account for week 6 (the week ended 5 May
2004) (page 7) and a shortage of £101.21 in the Cash Account for week 7 (the week ended 12 May
2004) (page, 17) is almost entirely due to the transfer of £100 into the shortages line on the
suspense’ account on 5 May 2004 and its subsequent removal on 7 May 2004.

The two computers

14. I have been asked to confirm whether I experienced certain problems with the Horizon computer
terminals whilst I was the temporary subpostmaster at the Marine Drive branch. Each day, I checked
that the branch paperwork (such as cheques, counterfoils and giro slips) agreed with the reports that
were printed from the computer and sent to the processing centre. I remember there were no
problems other than the usual minor run of the mill problems you tend to experience with computers
from time to time. In particular:

(a) I did not come across instances where the 2 computer terminals did not appear to

communicate with each other.

(b) 1 cannot recall whether the touch sensitive computer screen ever froze. This is not an
uncommon problem, but if it occurs, you can still use the keyboard to input information. 1

have never known it to cause any balancing problems.
(c) I cannot remember there being any occasions when the screen went blank.

(d) I cannot recall the card swipe device being particularly defective, although this can be a fairly
common occurrence in any branch. It can happen if the magnetic strip on the customer's
credit or debit card was old, dirty or scratched. If the card swipe device failed to read the
card, it would not misread and record erroneous information, rather it would simply not read
any information at all. If this happens, you can re-swipe the card or just type in the card

number instead.
(e) There were no instances of the Overnight Cash Holding (ONCH) figures doubling up.
(f) There were no instances of transactions being entered on the system and being lost.

15. I have been asked whether any of the computer equipment was changed whilst I was at the Marine
Drive branch. I certainly do not remember any being changed at the time and do not believe that it

was. — 543

POL00074091
POL00074091

Car auction deposits

16. There was one thing at the Marine Drive branch that struck me as being highly irregular at the time.
A car auction in Bridlington would usually deposit around £15,000 to £20,000 in cash each week in
one or two tranches. It was by far the largest amount that the Marine Drive branch would receive in
cash deposits each week. The cash would usually be left with Mr Castleton in the shop early in the
morning before the Post Office counter opened. It was left in a bag or boxes and there was no
covering note stating how much cash there was: it was simply left to the Marine Drive branch to count
and to pay into the customer’s girobank account. I never met this customer. The paying in book was
kept permanently behind the Post Office counter whereas it should have been retained by the
customer. Not wanting to upset the relationship with the customer, I did not raise my concerns about

this with them or with Mr Castleton.

29 May 2004 onwards

17. I was unable to continue as temporary subpostmaster at the Marine Drive branch beyond 28 May
2004 because I had prior relief work booked. After I left, Dorothy Day took over as subpostmaster
and worked at the branch with her husband.

18. In around late September 2004, Ms Oglesby contacted me to ask me if I would act as relief
subpostmaster at the Marine Drive branch again presumably because at the time, it was thought that
Dorothy Day was not going to continue in the role. She sent to me the contract papers. After
speaking to Ms Oglesby I received 2 or 3 telephone calls from Mr Castleton. He explained that he did
not want me to go back to the Marine Drive branch because he wanted to keep Dorothy Day as the
customers had become used to her. He said he would make it difficult and very expensive for me if I

went back.

19, The barrister of Mr Castleton’s father in law Allan then telephoned me to say that the business was
being purchased by Allan’s pension fund and it was therefore his duty to ensure a proper rate of
return which in his opinion would require rent for the Marine Drive branch of £1,250 per month. I
had paid Mr Castleton £255 total rent for the period of just over 5 weeks (which worked out at just
under £51 per week) whilst I was a subpostmaster at the Marine Drive branch, so rent of £1,250 per
month would make it uneconomic to run. Given that and the problems Mr Castleton said would crop
up if I returned, I decided to decline Ms Oglesby’s offer. She asked me to confirm this in writing to
her which I did on 3 October 2004 (page 64). I do not know what rent Dorothy Day is paying.
