[Start of Response]

Usage Violation: This is a reponse from the autorising Bank CAPO in this case
lwherby the expected (daily or maybe weekly) amount of monies withdrawn would
lexceed the contracted limit.

Timeout for response 23 is where our Authorisation agent- has not had a reply
from the banking authority within 18 seconds.

You may note that the response 23's have duplicated in the spreadsheet as there
lare infact 2 Confirmations in this scenario. So there are actually 80 zero value
transactions and not 83.

Ce: Pinder Brian; Sewell Peter (FELO1); Lowther Neneh
Subject: RE: Gaerwen Fad code 160604

Oddette,

the original email makes reference to an audit. To answer your question definitively I'd need to know what data they are FS
auditing that defines a “nil transaction". Is it zero transaction values in the R or A messages? Or are they auditing data in

some host database or log? This matters because for example, the counter doesn't send up an amount value in the R-

message for "Withdraw to limit", but that may be represented as a zero value in a log or database field. The same might

be true for Change PIN and Balance Enquiry.

All banking transactions are approved on-line with the acquirer. The-acquirer may decline for reasons other than
incorrect PIN entry (for example a stolen/cancelled card was used). These other reasons might also cause a nil
transaction.

Nil transactions could also be caused by errors in PIN Pad, counter, agents.or host code depending on what constitutes a
“nil transaction". This cannot be determined without access to the appropriate system logs. I understand that it is not felt
to be appropriate at this stage for those logs to be examined by development staff. I'd recommend however that counter
logs are harvested now before potential evidence is lost.

Regards,
Ric.

Hi Ric,
Can you have a look at this?
They really need to know if there is anything else that could have caused the nil transactions.

Many Thanks,

Graham,

Just to clarify, the Subpostmaster has not made any calls to HSH or NBSC prior to yesterdays audit, and is now voicing,

his concerns over the nil transactions on card account/on line banking transactions.

I believe there are at least 2 scenarios where a nil value will be recorded. These are.
If a customer places a card into the pinpad and enters an incorrect pin
number, the system will decline the transaction and request the customer
to remove their card. This transaction was undertaken at the branch
using a Post Office card account operated by the auditor. The report was
printed with a nil value showing
If a customer places a POCA card into the pinpad, enters a correct PIN
and asks to withdraw cash, if there are no funds in the-account, the
transaction will be declined and the customer requested to remover their
card. The summary would again show a nil value against the transaction

Please can you check any other possibilities of nil values.on these types of transactions with Fujitsu.

Also as the Subpostmaster is blaming the system on his losses, please could we check there are no problems with the
Horizon kit at the branch.

To confirm, the branch will remain closed until we are happy that the Horizon system is fully operational.
Thanks
Diane

Hi

Here's a copy of Grahams request concerning Gaerwen outlet.

The ‘thorough analysis’ | have agreed with Graham is the analysis of all nil transactions on card account/on line

banking transactions.

We need to identify now how we request the analysis from SSC. Presumably we have to use audit data for this
analysis: If | down load the messagestore can we do a peak request? - if so, could we do this together so | know for

future how to do it?

As you can see, | have also suggested that PO log a helpdesk call and request that the system is checked for error.

Kind regards
Penny

I've spoken with the Fujitsu security team and have agreed the following
course of action.

Fujitsu will instigate a thorough analysis of the system at the office

going back one month from the date of the audit (if we need to go back
further we will do). | do not see a need to remove hardware at this point
to conduct any specialist examination of the processors, particularly given
the Postmaster did not report any faults with the system to the HSH. I
would suggest that a call is logged with the HSH (by you or the CS&M)
outlining the "alleged" fault and asking them to send an engineer to the
site to conduct a test of the equipment prior to the office being

re-opened. I'm sure they can also perform a few test transactions.

Any queries please shout.

thanks....but you've confused me +!

what is an R&A message ? .

what is a host database ? .......... (I believe the nil transactions.

were identified on a transaction log)
| think it best that the system logs are examined in the first instance (do
you need an ARQ for this ?), going back to the 1 April 2005. Is it possible
for you to run a report to show 'nil' values for the transaction examples
described below, so we can see how often it has happened ?

Hi Graham.
As you know, nothing is ever straightforward! Here's some feedback -

‘The original email makes reference to an audit. To answer your question
~vefinitively I'd need to know what data they are auditing that defines a

nil transaction”. Is it zero transaction values in the R or A messages? Or
are they auditing data in some host database or log? This matters because
for example, the counter doesn't send up an amount value in the R message
for "Withdraw to limit", but that may be represented as a zero value ina

log or database field. The same might be true for Change PIN and Balance
Enquiry.

All banking transactions are approved on-line with the acquirer. The
acquirer may decline for reasons other than incorrect PIN entry (for
example

a stolen/cancelled card was used). These other reasons might also cause a
nil transaction.

Nil transactions could also be caused by errors in PIN Pad, counter, agents
or host code depending on what constitutes a "nil transaction". This cannot
be determined without access to the appropriate system logs."

In other words, we need to check the system logs. How would you like to
proceed?

Kind regards
Penny
