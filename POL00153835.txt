Subject: Sparrow Related Board Minutes

Hi Alwen,
POL00153835
POL00153835

Thank you for providing Patrick with the minutes for the Sparrow Sub Committee meetings and the extracts from other
Board Meetings relevant to Sparrow. I will forward these on to Jonathan Swift QC this afternoon. As one would expect,
numerous papers and reports are cross referenced within these minutes.

In the attached Schedule, I have highlighted the reports / papers I think Jonathan may subsequently request. Is there a
central repository somewhere which contains these outputs and I could access if Jonathan does indeed request copies?
Further, would you be happy / best placed to provide some contextualisation on the matters discussed — if it is
requested?

Many thanks Alwen
