FUJITSU SERVICES BUSINESS OWNER: James Guy

POST OFFICE BUSINESS OWNER: Matthew Langley
SUBMISSION TO POST OFFICE DATE: 28" February 2023

SUMMARY OF WORK:

The audit system stores data, depending on its type, for a default period of 7 years or 18
months. Post Office previously asked Fujitsu Services to retain audit data beyond the default
periods until 30th April 2023. The original purge date was 12th October 2014.

Post Office now require Fujitsu Services to further extend the data retention periods until
30th April 2024. Audit systems can be configured to delay restart of purging until after this
revised date; however, the data retention period is reliant on the extension of the Data
Centre Operations Services being agreed and signed by the Parties by 31* March 2023. The
Data Centre Operations Service shall cease on 31* March 2024 and this obligation shall cease
at that time. Additionally, it is the Parties intention to move the audit data to the Post Office
Cloud. If completion of this is prior to 31* March 2024 then upon completion of this activity
the retention of data shall then become a Post Office responsibility

The Eternus storage deletion prevention date is not being changed. This means that any
audit data older than 7 years or 18 months is not protected by the Eternus deletion

prevention

CHANGE WORK ORDER DELIVERABLES:

A configuration file exists which defines how long data should be kept beyond the standard
defined by Eternus. The configuration will be changed so that purging does not start until the
1 May 2024. The NumExtraHoursToKeepTracks parameter will be increased from 74,976
(8.56 years) to 83,760 (9.56 years). This change will be tested in development, SV&d, and in
LST because although the configuration file has been modified several times before it is
always possible that some system limit will be hit.

Development have VMs representing all the machines in the audit solution that can be
snapshot and advanced forward in time. With the changed configuration file in place, the
VMs will be advanced forward in time and the purger will be run to confirm that data is not
purged until it is expected to be. After the tests are finished, the VMs will be set back to their
normal working snapshot.

The machines cannot be moved forward in time in the SV&I or LST test environments.
However, test can alter the “Until date” and “Until time” of a few tracks in the sealer
database and confirm that an attempt is only made to purge the tracks if the date is
sufficiently in the past. An attempt to purge them will be logged in the daily purger log.

Note: Post Office will indemnify Fujitsu Services for any claim made or fine imposed on
Fujitsu Services by a data subject or any other party in relation to the extended retention of
personal data as required under this CWO.

IMPLEMENTATION TIMEFRAME:

Exact dates for progression of this change to be agreed between Post Office and Fujitsu
Services upon approval of this CWO and supply of a valid Purchase Order.

Changes and/or re-prioritisations of entries in this schedule may be required as a result of
potential impacts/conflicts relating to resource and infrastructure caused by this CWO.

In the event that changes to delivery timescales are identified by Fujitsu Services or Post
Office, such changes shall be discussed and agreed at the Demand Planning Forum and
managed via change control.

which is currently contracted until 31 March 2023
(though the parties are working towards

extending).

Acceptance Criteria Fujitsu Services will configure the audit system to delay the
lrestart of purging until 30" April 2024

(Acceptance Method Solution Test

Dependencies (e.g. Third Party or Technical):
The CCN to extends the Data Centre Operations Service must be signed by 31* March 2023 to
enable Fujitsu Services to deliver this Project

Post Office Responsibilities:
Post Offfice shall ensure that the CCN to extends the Data Centre Operations Service is signed
by 31% March 2023

Other:

There is a risk that the extension fails in development because of some unforeseen system
limit, and so it will be necessary to modify the audit purger to overcome the system limit.

The Eternus disks are end of service life, and so become increasingly likely to fail as time
goes on.
