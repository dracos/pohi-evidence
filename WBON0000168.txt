Hi Jonny,

Sorry, but you didn’t send me the actual question until I’d gone off line around 4ish yesterday, so other than
the phone call I had from Pete, I didn’t see the emails until late last night.

A further clarification:

The Giro Bank Transactions are not AP, but standard EPOSS Transactions. I don’t know how info on them
got to Giro Bank — it may well be that Giro Bank worked off the paper trail and then sent summaries to POL
which they then reconciled with the Horizon feed. POL would need to provide the details.

Prior to online banking (introduced in 2003), POL did support some (but not all) other banks with deposit
and cheque cashing facilities. Again these were EPOSS (not AP) transactions. I assume that there was also a
paper trail here and it would work in a similar way to Giro Bank. Again it is POL that need to define the
process. All Horizon did was provide the buttons to record the electronic part of the transaction.

Is there any point in me re-reading Steve’s statement? I’m out this morning, but could do so this afternoon.

Hope this helps.

Best wishes

Gareth

Thanks. When you say you have had to interpret, do you mean interpret my email and/or what Gareth has said, or
do you mean you passed on my email and Gareth confirmed that it is correct?

ossible examples to use - effective software fixes [WBDUK-

Yes it has been sent to Gareth, but it is:

How is it possible for SSC to inject a GIRO bank transfer into a set of branch accounts but it isn't possible to inject
another bank deposit? Gareth’s answer Giro Bank paying in was possible into accounts by AP as it was introduced
before on line banking so you needed was the account number and detailed knowledge of the system so theoretically
it was possible. But there was a paper work trail to back this up that the sub-postmaster had to send in to POL which
should then reconcile to the AP transaction file from Horizon. (Post Office would understand how it worked). A report
was produced daily to reconcile against the Horizon feed, any discrepancy Post Office may find where the paper work
was not present would be discussed with the branch at the time. Post Office can describe what would happen if the
paperwork was not available.

Steve thinks the answer is:

I think the answer is that Giro bank is also an AP transaction (like bill payments). It is the only type of bank account
that is. All other banking deposits go through a totally different path. There may have been other banks who had
similar facilities before on line banking was introduced in 2004? but you would have to ask Post Office as they were
AP transactions.

Thanks

Steve,

Thank you for this. Updated version attached. We are down to one point to bottom out, which is the GIRO bank
theory in para. 35. The bit we are struggling with is that it if it is possible to deposit money in a Giro bank account,
how is it not possible to deposit money in a normal account. Why is a paper slip necessary for this type of account?

It might be worth having a quick call on this. Are you free?

Kind regards

Jonny, we’ve been looking at some potential examples to use within the witness statement. Suggest WBD
have a look and decide if it is useful to add them as examples?

Effective Software Fixes

pcooss9is: PSteed2847N - reverse a rem, but when this has been
reversed it is doubling up on a balance

+ve: Already mentioned in statement but still shows a quick software error turn round

28/04/03: SSC (Paul Steed) identified error

28/04/03: Paul Steed updated and sent to MSU to handle discrepancy with FAD & POL

30/04/03: Development identify error

01/05/03: Work Package generated: PWY_WP_16353 B3S30R

07/05/03: Tested on LST. Fix released.

09/05/03: I have spoken to the PM to say that the software fix was sent down and became active on 07-May-
2003 and so there should be no recurrences of the original problem.

pco123699: 28/07/05 ...payments and receipts are mismatched...PM
states he was balancing on node 2 but there was discrepancies...

-ve: Initial SSC response was erroneous, to send back to Helpdesk.

+ve: Fast fix to live for financial issue

+ve: Demonstrates passing to MSU to tie up financial impact with POL

+ve: Example of looking at more than one site, diligence identifying other sites with issue

+ve: Shows how an initial R&P error is seen by PM and support are subsequently able to identify other events
that tie it in to other sites

28/07/05: Incorrectly sent back by SSC ...Balancing problems should be dealt with initially by NBSC...

28/07/05: ...Have spoken with the PM and advised...All that remains now is for us to try and identify the root
cause of the discrepancy which may take a while. As per usual we will forward our findings on to the MSU who
will advise POL accordingly...

29/07/05 With development. Work Package PWY_WP_22602 generated

01/08/05: BI3S80R_WP22602 is now ready for test

02/08/05: Release PinICL PCO123865

08/08/05: This has passed testing in LST and is being returned to RM for live pilot.

09/08/05: sent out to the Pilot 100 successfully

05/09/05: Applied to all live outlets and now in the live Generic Prodlists roll-outs using both $70 and $80 spares

When the PM went to produce a trail balance a discrepancy was shown but at the bottom the receipts and
payment totals did not match.

The £170 discrepancy was down to an APS txn message that had no product number and no primary or
secondary mappings. There was a critical event raised on 21st Jul on counter 9 which helped to identify this
(Event Id:4 with the text "Error Message: Failed to generate EPOSSCore transaction grammar").

As the txn message was incomplete it was omitted from the rollover 'calculations' and thus caused the
discrepancy reported.

When I checked the tivoli event archives yesterday I found that 216 of these events had been logged in the past 7
days at different offices/counters

WBD_000038.000012
WBONO0000168
WBON0000168

Looks like whenever the event is raised it is either down to a cancelled quantum txn
Have checked out a sample of 40 to 50 sites and they're all at S80 so its probably safe to assume its an S80
problem.
