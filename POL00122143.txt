A need to Retain exhibits securely as per Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996
Part Il Retention of Material

5.7 All material which may be relevant to the investigation must be retained until a
decision is taken to institute proceedings against a person for an offence.

5.8 If a criminal investigation results in proceedings being instituted, all material
which may be relevant must be retained at least until the accused is acquitted or
convicted or the prosecutor decides not to proceed with the case.

5.9 Where the accused is convicted, all material which may be relevant must be
retained at least until;

- the convicted person is released from custody, or discharged from hospital,
in cases where the Court imposes a custodial sentence or a hospital order.

- six months from the date of conviction, in all other cases.

If the Court imposes a custodial sentence or hospital order and the convicted
person is released from custody or discharged from hospital earlier than six months
from the date of conviction, all material which may be relevant must be retained at
least until six months from the date of conviction.

5.10 If an appeal against conviction or hospital is in progress when the release or
discharge occurs, or at the end of the period of six months specified in paragraph
5.9, all material which may be relevant must be retained until the appeal is
determined. Similarly, if Criminal Cases Review Commission is considering an
application at that point in time, all material may be relevant must be retained at
least until the Commission decides not to refer the case to the Court of Appeal or
the Crown Court, or until the Court determines the appeal resulting from the
reference by the Commission.

The secure room is to be located at Future Walk, Chesterfield S49 1PF and to be managed
by Mr Christopher Knight, Security Manager.

To provide the Post Office Ltd Security Team with the facility to securely store exhibits prior
to a trial and following a Prosecution.

Exhibit items will be stored in a secure room with Room G07, Future Walk, Chesterfield,
S49 1PF under the control of Mr Knight. Access to the room is via a key controlled by Mr
Knight.

The Police use a computerised logging system which manages their exhibits. Post Office
Ltd does not have access to this but it is in essence only a database. Any referenced filing
system would be adequate for this purpose.

Where a number of Exhibit items in a case are held and wish to be sent to the secure
storage they should be placed within a plastic sack and sealed with a numbered seal.

The bag will then transferred by way of a notebook entry to the secure store. When the
sack is received it will be booked in on the Excel database.

The sack will not be opened so the onus will be on the OIC to ensure all items are included.
A review date will be set which will be either the Court date or destroy date.
Process

1) Temporary exhibit storage: For the Security Manager he / she will decide if they wish
to submit exhibits to be stored prior to a Court trial. It is suggested that this would
realistically have to be at least two months in advance of a Court date.

The OIC would place all the exhibits in to a clear plastic sack or sacks and seal each
one with a numbered plastic one trip seal. The sealed bag(s) are to be listed in the
OIC’s pocket book as being handed to either the transporting person, the postage
details (Special Delivery to be used) or the Exhibit Store manager; signature(s) of
transfer to be recorded in pocket book.

2) Exhibit storage: On the conclusion of the case the OIC will manage the exhibits using
the following process;

Exhibits

i) Exhibit items that were not used as a part of the prosecution in Court to be
destroyed’

ii) Exhibit items that can be returned to owner / witness’
iii) Exhibit items that are to be securely stored.

Items destined for the exhibit store will be transported as per the process described
previously in this paper.

It is envisaged there will a review of Exhibit items stored so that it does not become a
dumping ground. Reviews to occur twice a year.
