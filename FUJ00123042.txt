Attachments: 2nd draft staement with comments.doc

Dear Gareth,

Thank you very much for your 2nd draft. You are quite right to rebuff me when I have been asking
too much! I have added a few more comments, this time in green. There are naturally enough some
typos, some of which I have pointed out. Obviously please do a careful typo check before completing
the document. Is it possible within the framework of the statement to put in paragraph numbers? It
will help when you give your evidence.

I received the Professor's final version last night. I have not yet had a chance to read it in detail. I
will try to speak to you late morning. I anticipate that it should be possible to serve your completed
statement by 4pm today.

As ever, many thanks.
