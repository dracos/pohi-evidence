Hi Martin

I wonder if you could help me please. I currently doing some work as part of the second sight review with Carole
Butler Case Review Handler. We are looking at Rugeley branch and Mr Carl Adrian Page who was Subpostmaster
between Feb 1997 and Jan 2003.

In July 2005 at Dudley Crown Court Mr Page pleaded not guilty to charges of conspiracy to defraud the Post Office
along with a co- defendant Mr Whitehouse (a customer) and a charge of theft. The case involved huge volumes of
currency, initially Irish Punts and then Euros and US Dollars which were sold at preferential rates. Both men were

found not guilty of the conspiracy charge but the jury failed to reach a verdict on the theft charge.

Mr Page at a later hearing pleaded guilty to theft of £94,000.00 and was given a custodial sentence.

Ihave spoken to Post Office security but apart from a debarment notice due to the time scales they could not supply
anything to assist us with our enquiries.

My first question is to ask if you have anything on this case but given the age everything may of course have been
destroyed.

Could you also advise me on the following please, if you are able. Mr Page states that at the second trial there was
one single charge of theft of £282,000.00 and just before the trial commenced the Prosecuting counsel made an
offer to the defence to change the amount that was allegedly stolen from £282,000.00 to £94,000.00 as it was.
known that if the alleged amount was less than £100.000.00 the likely custodial sentence would be 2 years or
under. Mr Page was allegedly also advised that he would be a candidate or open prison. He did change his plea to
guilty and received a custodial sentence of which he served 6 months in prison 3 months on a tag. Is this
plausible?

I look forward to hearing from you and thank you for your help
