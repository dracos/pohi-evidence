Litigation Monitoring Protocol — Guidance

This document is intended to provide a framework for the drafting of a protocol to monitor ongoing
litigation, suitable for insertion into a submission to the Permanent Secretary. Note that this is a generic
framework only and different cases will require these provisions to be amended. Matters to be considered
in respect of certain of these amendments are included in [NOTE]s below.

As and if the case continues, we consider it appropriate to agree a protocol with you and with [the
organisation] to ensure that the Department is sighted on the progress and risks associated with this
case in a manner that is clear and to the satisfaction of all concerned.

We would be grateful for your views on the following proposal:
UKGI [, alongside [Department] Legal,] will revert to you with further submissions providing an update

on the progress of the case and any salient points arising out of it by reference to [three] specific
touchpoints, mostly derived from the litigation process (set out in the table below):

Counsel. At no point will UKGI or Department Legal form a view on any of these matters.]

At each of these touchpoints, the progress of the case will be set out and, if necessary, the position and
views of the [relevant bodies / individuals] (and their relevant legal advisors), as required. [[Department]
Legal comment and input will be obtained, and they will be present at all key meetings which UKGI have
in relation to the litigation, however, they and UKGI will not provide an independent evaluation of the
litigation and its risks.
