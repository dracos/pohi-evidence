Understood.

The purpose of my email was simply to ensure that Royal Mail is joined up and is aware that we are being asked to
comment in two cases by the same expert who is involved in multiple cases.

Best wishes

PLEADE DO NOT FORWARD THIS ' E'MAIL' ON

Dear Mr Jones

Your ‘e-mail in respect of Jerry Hosi -Porters Avenue has been forwarded to
me.

Please note that I am the Solicitor dealing with the case of Hosi which is
being dealt with separately. As such information regarding the case of Hosi
should not be supplied to Mr Misra's (West Byfleet) Expert. Indeed Hosi's
case should not be discussed with Misra's Expert in any way without
reference to me.

The proper course is for Misra's Solicitors to make representations to the
relevant Solicitor at Legal Services who w consider any request.

I reiterate that information supplied to the Defence experts should be
specific to the case referred.

Yours sincerely
Juliet McFarlane
