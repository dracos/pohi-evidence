Audit Review - Background

+ Early 2008 the Network Support Field Team (NSFT) took over the responsibility
for Financial and Compliance auditing from the National Audit Team

+ Initially the processes and tools used by the NAT were maintained but in Jan
2009 we undertook a revision of all the Audit Process Chapters as a basic starting
point for the new ways of working using a multi-skilled team of Field Support
Advisors (FSA)

+ At this time the revision was simply to align the old p to the new team
structure and to create robust working tools to deliver the information gathered.

« During 2009 ‘SharePoint’ was added as a means of reporting, to improve the
speed of availability of reports

«April 2010, the Scheduling & Admin Team at Salford became part of the NSFT
and at the same time took on the role of scheduling all audit activity and processing
the admin arising from audits.

+ Currently all of the Audit Process Chapters are reviewed against an annual rolling
timetable and are the responsibility of the Network Services Team Leaders.

The need for a review

* Since the initial revision of all audit chapters in Jan 2009, as
business as usual we have made small operational changes
either as a result of changes to operational practices within
the business, or and less frequently, requests hi-lighted by
stakeholders such as the Contract Team, Security, Product &
Branch Accounting (P&BA), Bank of Ireland (Bol), Compliance
Team, Risk & Compliance Committee (R&CC), and others.

« However, we have not undertaken a complete review or
engaged pro-actively with and identified all stakeholders, to
ascertain that our processes and outputs are fit for purpose
and what we would want to deliver.

Identify and engage with all stakeholders:

Looking first at our own team in NST, the stakeholders identified within each chapter then approaching other teams within POL
and the wider working relationship we have such as the Banks of Ireland & England.

Seek feedback on each chapter:

We will supply a copy of each of the process chapters and ask for feedback on the effectiveness from the stakeholder point of
view, identification of anything they see as a gap, and any suggested improvements.

Review the current process and tools and working papers considering the feedback:

Revise according to agreements made:

I will engage with each of the chapter owners to review the feedback alongside the current process and revise as required, all
materials, tools, reports and processes to deliver an improved output. Initial timetable embedded here.

Review Chapter ownership:

The current ownership responsibilities will be reviewed to ensure that Chapters that have significant cross-over will be owned
by the same person going forward.

Cascade revised material to all - NST, Stakeholders:

The final outputs will be cascaded first to the NST team including Head of Network Services, Regional Network Managers, Field
Team leaders and FSA's, Scheduling & Admin & Change Team Contracts Team, and the Network Performance Team. This will be
communicated at face to face events at the end of Q2 .Secondly via written communication to all other stakeholders.

Train the FSA's, and Team Leaders in deployment of new tools, processes and standards:

There will be a number of training events late Q2/early Q3 to roll out the process to the Field Team who will be delivering the
audit activity. GO live of the process is anticipated to commence in Q3 in advance of the next 5 year plan in 2012.

The Requests

KEEP
Stakeholder — John Breeden

Section 3.12 - A pian of activity for the week ahead should also be forwarded to the Contracts
Advisors, Network Support Projects & Standards Manager and the Regional Network
Managers.

Currently do this on a weekly basis for the week ahead and is sent te ail the above and Security.
This is make all aware of potential audit activity that may lead to suspension and so that
they can be prepared.

LOSE
FIL/FSA

Section 3.8 bullet point “Attendance by a Team Leader to be focused on Crowns or high risk
branches likely to lead to a suspension (e.g. investigation audits or speciaily requested
audits)

We will not lose this as we currently have a list of Field Team Members that can conduct these
Audits which is continually growing through development of the teams. This focuses the
team Leaders limited time on high risk activity where additional support is needed by Field
Team Members and allows time for all other performance management activity to be
completed.

CHANGE
Stakeholder — John Breeden
Section4.3 — does the FTL complete compliance audit at 3 month PTV?

Now done on the 6-9month audit but the FTL will lock at the New Agent Self Audit that the new agent
should have completed before the PTV.

Stakeholder — FSA/FTL
Keep e-mails listing staff on P356, but also include outstanding debt figure on e-mail.

When audit admin send out the office employee HR register for each audit they could include the
outstanding debt figure as well (I would prefer to see or hear that there is no debt than just not get a phone
cal

Receive cash management & agent debt prior to audit as often no phone reception in remote areas. As
above

All the above are asking for the same request. This would be of benefit to everyone but unfortunately this
cannot be done due to the data on SAP being updated daily. This data would then be out of date when the
audit is conducted.

The requests continued

Stakeholder — Scheduling and Admin team.

38 “Declaration of interests, detailing any auditor's conflict of interests with the branches due to be
audited” add “e.g. FSA relatives working at a branch”

Add a builet point for: “The distance FSAs have to travel, plus the cost per mile”

The above relates to what the admin team consider when scheduling activity. We do look at conflicts of
interest and are shortly due to again ask the team. We also believe that the last point should be added
as it is one of the many factors we consider when scheduling.

Change the current attachment for stating resource at a post office and replace with an up to date
version. Ensure the version used for this years audit plan is the one on Ease, any updates can be used
to form next years plan.

Resource is reviewed yearly and we have added current resource spreadsheet which formed the plan for
this year.

ADD - Stakeholder ~ Scheduling and Admin Team.

Add details of some of the Audit Admin duties relevant to the daily audit procedures e.g. acquiring and
disclosing / emailing debt, REMS and staff details, P32 electronic filing, Compliance Certificate returns
and reminders as follows: all added to Chapter 3 feedback for consideration

Request

Lose the need to complete
an ECF where there is an
audit surplus in excess of
£1000 or if the outstanding
debt figure has caused the
audit discrepancy to
exceed £1000

A suggestion to improve
the way we work
(Lose/change/keep) & cut
down errors; we do use
too many acronyms on
EASE {itself another
acronym!), maybe that
could be looked at under
‘change’

Action Taken

No Action — reason this is
included on FAA P32 is due to
the fact that CA's are not
always aware (or may need
reminding) that there is
outstanding debt at the
branch. This in tum could
have a bearing on their
decisions.

All abbreviations on Event
Capture Form (ECF) changed
to full unless already
explained. Also on ECF area
covered now added to John
and Lin’s names, Cathy's
name spelt correctly & “p”
changed to Capital on
Security Programme Manager.

Benefit

Benefit in completing
ECF on FAA P32 if
outstanding debt takes
amount over £1k is that
it highlights other
possible issues apart
from those found on
audit which may need to
be taken into
consideration by the CA.

Changes Made

Instructions have been added to the Chapter and the Work aid for the completion
of a FAA P32 for all transfers and to complete SharePoint

Completion of the FAA P32 should not have any impact on the time taken to
complete a Transfer Audit .

Audit Codes have been added to the FAA P32:
5 — BAU Transfers
10 ~Transfer to Temporary Agent
15 — Transfer to re-instated Agent
Benefit

This will provide an adequate record of the cash and high value stock transferred in
the event of any issues arising following the Transfer.

Section 4.12 in the Chapter ‘Complete the P32 for an FAA audit (code 5, 10 or 15 as appropriate) using all information gathered
from verifications. Complete SharePoint as usual following the transfer’.

POL00085658

POL00085658

P32 and Audit Report

It was felt that a report for the Transfer to be sent to the
outgoing Agent would not be of interest to someone leaving
the business and therefore not necessary.

Historically, when full audits were completed for transfers, no
report was completed or sent to the outgoing agent.

The current report would not be appropriate as it does not fit
the purpose of the transfer audit so would require quite a lot
of altering, or a new template would have to be produced.

Altering the report or using a new template would add to the
FSA’s time for a transfer audit.

Feedback Changes Ge)

Notes added to the Cash Centre Control Tests to Highlight
variations in:

Opening procedures due to varying locale
H&S regulations for each site
Security procedures in different sites

Clarification of the opportunity to check any discrepancies

- OPENING PROCEDURES

The meeting points will be different at each Cash Centre as agreed with Security.

Minimum three Cash Centre personnel meet away from site, not in view of centre, and by questioning determine whether the
meeting location is changed periodically. The meeting points will be different at each Cash Centre as agreed with Security.

Some sites park away from the unit but in sight of the front door. Some sites will drive around the site to view the perimeter, as
itis safer.

Two Cash Centre personnel must inspect the perimeter fence and windows to ensure they haven't been breached. Third
person waits with mobile phone at the entrance, with a car parked at front gates to reduce threat of unauthorised access. Some
sites park away from the unit but in sight of the front door.

- H&S

Depending on the risk the designated area for protective footwear will be different across the sites

Cash Centre staff to ensure Field Support Team have protective footwear before access to Banking floor by asking the Lead
Auditor to verify. Protective footwear is not required in all areas at every centre- the H&S guide for the centre should be
checked at each site whilst completing the Control Test for site agreement.

- SECURITY

In some sites overnight trunkers will have deposited Rems into R&D. A conscious decision is taken to leave the vaults shut all
night to protect the majority of the cash.

Field Support Team to walk around Banking floor and despatch area to ensure that no items have been left unsecured
overnight. In some sites overnight trunkers will have deposited Rems into R&D. A conscious decision is taken to leave the vaults
shut all night to protect the majority of the cash.

In some sites route coin will be outside the vault - either because it is worked on overnight or because it means the vaults can
remain closed for longer.

Confirm if any cash or pouches were left outside the vault overnight, unsecured and/or unattended. (Bronze can be left outside
secure area/cage if cash holdings are high)
POL00085658
POL00085658

Site have different arrangements that do not necessarily involve codes. I.E. Automated sites have remote unsetting of the
vaults.
Confirm that two personnel each hold part of the vault code and not the full code where applicable i.e. non automated sites.

We don’t have vault logs in all sites. Not part of our processes.
Confirm that the Access Log has been maintained for all personnel accessing the vault. (Only applicable for Midway CC, not
applicable for all other CC’s).

- CHECKING SHORTAGES

The processing clerk or Manager should be given the opportunity of checking the cash themselves if a discrepancy is identify by
auditor.

If significant, discuss with the Field Team Leader and agree when the Shift/Unit Manager should be made aware of the
discrepancy. The processing clerk or Manager should be given the opportunity of checking the cash themselves if a discrepancy
is identified by auditor.

Chapter 8 Feedback and
Answers

Only received feedback from 4 people ( Judy Balderson,
Linda & John Breeden and unidentified)

Too much time is being wasted on copying and pasting
reports on to templates. We can print a copy direct from the
tool to send a hard copy to the agent. Why can we not just
send the completed tool to all other relevant parties and they
can print off the report if they feel it necessary and also have
access to any other information they want. This would save
time, ink and paper.

Look at renaming the audit reports to reflect type of branch for
consistency and clarity? BEGIN WITH CODE?

Section 8.2.5 —Horizon User Report details recorded on a
spreadsheet with User Names and all anomalies reported
including non registered staff — This report sent to Contracts

Advisor if with Appendices A & B. Add CA to matrix for audit

Answers

Received feedback from 3 people (Shirley Hailstone, Judy Balderson,
& Dave Patrick)

Retention of papers. Recommendation: to lose the chapter but include
reference to retention of papers in the appropriate chapter e.g. Quality
Assurance, Performing a branch audit, Robbery & Burglary Audits, etc.
Declined on the basis we would have to add to all other chapters.

“I note on the robbery/burglary work aid that the retention period for the
papers is 60 days unless there is a suspicion of negligence. Obviously
there are people with much more knowledge than me but in all my years in
audit up until I have always retained the papers and submitted these for
retention. Could I just enquire is 60 days enough?” Yes this is the
business standard based on , need, storage availability and cost .

Introduction — states that if the Security Manager has not requested

paperwork, following an inegularity, then you must shred the papers after

60 days (investigators and Contracts Managers can request these

documents after the 60 days or even just ask questions concerning the

paperwork. This is a rare but can happen — there is no mention of where

we can archive papers for retention). We can’t go beyond 60 days as per
e

Summary

4. In all both chapters have been reduced significantly, the need to
complete so many different templates has now been removed and
this has now made it a lot user friendly for all, we don’t have the
issues of copying and pasting any more which should reduce the
amount of errors significantly.

2. Time spent on copying and pasting and pulling all the different
reports together has gone.

3. The Matrix is now user friendly with only three reports to send.

4. The guide to sending reports is a lot clearer and with only three
reports the naming of reports should not be an issue anymore.

5. The ability to save a copy of the ECF should heip in getting the
report of in the agreed timescales.

Feedback received from —

John Breeden - Section 1- if a code 200 Audit is cancelled at
short notice due to unforeseen circumstances the Contract
Advisor should be informed

Shirley Hailstones - Recommendation: Requires to be
more condensed i.e. too much additional information
present e.g. section on Computer Security; there are
currently policies in place which cover this. Also is there any
need for succession planning & exiting planning to be
included within this chapter?
