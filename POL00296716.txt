Subject: Horizon investigation

Hi Mike — Will mentioned that you had heard some rumours around the Second Sight investigation yesterday. Would
be good to have a quick word when you’re back at your desk.

As discussed with Will, we’d like to schedule a meeting with you, Will and Peter next week to update you on the
investigation. We’ll be in touch with some suggested times.

Thanks,
Martin
