‘onferences:

With Defence CsI: tries to persuade me that previous trial csl had agreed that this was not a
Breach of High Degree of Trust case. I said our position is that it was: whatever previous cs]
had said was for him and I was not bound by his comments.

With OIC: he informs me that previous csl had suggested to him that it was not a Breach of
Trust case and that OIC had argued the point with him. This reinforces my view that we will
present it as such.

AFTER HRG: Brief con with OIC; FI; expert and otrs after hrg to discuss sentence. All very
happy with outcome.

Hearing: (note time jury retired)
Opened in full. Re-iterated point that Horizon not at fault and D’s plea confirms that his
attack was nothing more than opportunism.

Burger King operative.
