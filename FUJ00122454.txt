Hi Dave

It's been a long time since we've spoken - hope all is well with you.

Ihave recieved a request for a witness statement, please see e-mail string, below. It was always normal procedure for WS requests to
come via Graham or his nominated stand in, and I would prefer it if all requests were to come through your office. Could you please

let me know if this causes you any problems.

Kind regards
Penny
