shown to be unauthorised, Fujitsu Services will not be liable for giving information or advice to

caller and the Incident itself. The Incident record will assign a unique reference number to the
call, unless the caller already has a unique reference number in relation to the Incident, in
which case that unique reference number will be used.

3.1.2.5 The Incident record will contain the information as described within the Working Document
entitled: “Service Desk Joint Working Document” (SVM/SDM/PRO/0021).

3.1.2.6 The Service Desk first line agent will take the details of the reported fault and then may refer to
a knowledge base and undertake diagnosis. The diagnosis may resolve the Incident in which
case the Service Desk first line agent will close the Incident with the agreement of the caller.

3.1.2.7 The Service Desk first line agent shall then update the Incident Management System as
described within the Working Document entitled: “Service Desk Joint Working Document”
(SVM/SDM/PRO/0021).

3.1.2.8 On concluding the call, the Service Desk first line agent will provide the caller with the unique
reference number associated with the Incident management record.

described within the Working Document entitled: “Service Desk Joint Working Document”

(SVM/SDM/PRO/0021).

3.4.2 Flexible Charging

3.4.2.1 Following each Service Level Measurement Period, Post Office and Fujitsu Services will
assess whether on average, in the relevant Service Level Measurement Period, the actual
number of calls is more than 110% or less than 90% of the limit. In making that
assessment, Post Office and Fujitsu Services shall consider the cause of any monthly peaks
in excess of the monthly averages during the period and disregard the measurements in
respect of those months where the peaks have arisen as a result of a Fujitsu Services
Default. If, having made this assessment, Post Office and Fujitsu Services agree (acting
reasonably), that the actual number of calls is more than 110% or less than 90% of the limit
applicable within any three (3) consecutive months, Post Office and Fujitsu Services shall
meet to discuss, (acting reasonably), any appropriate action, which shall include
consideration of the amount of the Charges for the Service Desk Service which may be
increased or decreased to reflect any increase or decrease in Fujitsu Services’ costs as
assessed on an Open Book basis. Any such adjustment to the Charges for the Service Desk
Service shall be agreed under the Change Control Procedure.

3.4.2.2 It is expected that 10% (ten per cent) of Incidents will be logged by Branches via the
Counter Interface.

3.4.2.3 Any increase in the percentage of Incidents logged via the Counter Interface will
instigate a review of the price of the Service Desk Service quoted in Schedule D1 of this
Agreement and a revised price per Counter Position assessed on an Open Book basis and
agreed between Post Office and Fujitsu Services. Any such adjustment to the Charges for
the Service Desk Service shall be agreed under the Change Control Procedure.

3.4.2.4 If circumstances arise such that Post Office requires urgent changes to the level of
service for the Service Desk Service, Fujitsu Services shall use reasonable endeavours to
extend the level of service as soon as reasonably practicable to whatever is required by Post
Office for a price to be assessed on an Open Book basis and agreed between the Parties.
Any such adjustment to the Charges for the Service Desk Service shall be agreed under the
Change Control Procedure. In these circumstances, any appropriate SLTs in force will be
suspended.

3.5 Assets and Licences

3.5.1. Assets

There are no assets associated with the Service Desk Service.

3.5.2 Licences

The Service Desk Service will ensure that all third party software licences from time to time required by
Fujitsu Services to provide the Service Desk Service are maintained to ensure they are current and valid
for the version of third party software being used at the time. Where a licence or its associated support
and maintenance is due to expire, and Fujitsu Services determine that renewal is required, the Service
Desk Service will ensure that the appropriate renewal process, as defined by the appropriate software
vendor or licensor, is completed and a new licence is concluded prior to the expiry date to ensure
continuity of the service.

of medium used by the caller to log the Incident using the Service Desk Service.

3.9.2 Infrastructure

3.9.2.1.1 All calls into the Service Desk are routed via a single number operated by British
Telecom (BT). This service has been stated to provide 100% resilience for call delivery into
the Service Desk, and therefore Fujitsu Services has not provided any additional resilience

in order to operate using this service.

3.9.2.1.2 In the event that the primary Service Desk site is rendered inoperable (e.g.
building evacuation), then calls are either re-directed to a Service Desk Voicemail Service,
or will automatically be redistributed to the Service Desk DR site.

3.9.2.1.3 Remote diverts can be activated, by approved managers, via Post Office's
suppliers. This may need to be used in conjunction with the temporary transference of
reinforcement staff from the primary Service Desk site to a DR site.

In the event that the back end server hosting the counter Interface becomes inoperable, Branches will
resort to telephone logging of Incidents until the Counter Interface is fully restored.

3.9.2.3 Incident Management System

In the event that the primary Incident Management System becomes unavailable, Manual call logging of
incidents will be envoked until the Incident Management system is restored. Once the system has been
restored all manually logged incidents will be logged onto the restored Incident Management system.

3.9.2.4 Power

To provide contingency against mains power failure, the Service Desk Incident Management System,
the Counter servers, and the Service Desk telephone communications equipment at the Service Desk

Fujitsu Services shall ensure Service Desk access to the Incident Management System at the DR site is
available to the Service Desk Service within three (3) hours of the initial failure.

with Post Office, such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld as defined within the Working
Document entitled: “HNG-X Operational Test Plan — Joint Working Document” (SVM/SDM/TP/0001).

3.9.3 Service Level Relief

3.9.3.1 If for any reason other than a Default by Fujitsu Services the Service Desk becomes
unavailable for use, the SLTs as set out within this Service Desk Service, Service Description
