All

| have arranged for Diane to meet with Gareth at 1100 hrs on Thursday (4th floor Rm 2) to record the statement.

She has already had sight of the statement and comments which Gareth can provide so it shouldnt take too long.

Once she has done this | thought it would be nice to introduce her to the security team, show her around the audit room to see
how we do things and then perhaps have a few minutes open forum to discuss all aspects of the prosecution service.

She may also bring another member of the investigation team along which will all help to oil the wheels when requests come in.

Regards Brian
