Thank you for your response, John.

Please note that I have just received a communication from the POL investigator stating that POL legal are resisting
the request from the Defence. This means that the Defence will need to get an order from the Court before we/POL
are obliged to provide this information. I will let you know if this happens.

Thank you again for your help.

Having spoken wit Gareth on this matter I believe the requirement is to identify every counter release applied to live in
the last 7 years and provide a spreadsheet that details the Tivoli Product name, the date live rollout commenced and a
list of PEAKs and or CPs that the change addressed.

This will be dependant on access to PEAK archives with the use of current and historic RM databases.

At this point in time we are seeking a cost. To provide a cost we need to evaluate the time it will take to produce such
a spreadsheet, assuming all relevant information is still available.

There is then the question of who will do the work. I believe that whilst Sarah Payne or I could supervise this activity
we may have to bring in additional resource.

As such I do not feel I can readily provide a cost without input from other people.

Sarah and Sarah, I believe we need to discuss this further prior to making any commitment to Gareth.

John,

Please can you pick this up and see how far you can get with it. Penny will also need to know how long this takes as it
has cost implications. I’ve attached another mail from MSS giving counter inventories.

Penny,
I don't think so.

What they are after is a detailed list of every fix we have ever applied giving details of the problems that the fix was
addressing and when it was applied. I think this is a huge task and will not be of any use whatsoever, but that is what
they are asking for.

Clearly having a list of what is on the counters now is a starting point, but what they also need is a list of all historical
updates. NB looking at the boxes is no use as they may have been swapped!

An alternative approach is to provide details of all fixes that have been distributed over the years. Exactly when they
were applied to the counters in question is less relevant so there may be records of every counter package, its content
and the reason for the package being applied.

Regards

Gareth

Neil/Wayne,

Please can you take a look at the email trail below — we have done this in the past (in CS with assistance from
your area). However, in this instance I would like to know how long this will take/took. Basically we need to
provide details for each counter (fortunately only 3) of everything that has ever been applied, I've attached a
couple of example mails e.g. from the E&Y audit (commit directories and a spreadsheet (which is
unfortunately in alpha order so commit directories better to give an audit) of what I think we're looking for.

Penny/Gareth,
The information returned by MSS and then RM could be used in future for CP purposes.
Many thanks.

Gareth,

Ok so can I have details of the Branch Code and from when the data would be required and I'll look into it
tomorrow. The last time I did anything in this area was a good few years ago and if I remember correctly I
discussed % man day for cost purposes for each Branch with Brian Pinder.

Many thanks.

Sarah,
Yes it is changes made to the counters in one Branch.

I'm not sure if they want details of data Centre changes as well, but it is probably reasonable to initially
consider just counter changes
FUJ00156216
FUJ00156216

The background is that a Defence Expert is attempting to prove that financial losses in one or more branches.
are due to system problems and not due to fraud by Postmasters. I've tried to point out that looking at all fixes
is unlikely to help, but he seems to be persisting with this.

I'm out of the office today — but back in tomorrow. It would be useful to know what you require to be
provided e.g. is it for one Branch in Counter terms?

This request has come as a result of Gareth meeting with the defence expert and the defence expert
requesting this information from POL legal; they then requested via their investigator/Salford, as
FUJ00156216
FUJ00156216

process.

POL legal would not be aware POL has this info (1 doubt whether the investigator would, either).
Suggest we get a rough estimate, send through to Salford, give them the choice of raising a CP,
requesting via a RFI (which they then charge out to the Court or defence) or identifying their own
records.

I must admit, I didn’t consider POL being in possession of this information!

I'd be grateful for the chat.

Kind regards
Penny

If they want all info since Horizon started, that’s a lot. POL have this information — any reason they
aren't providing this directly? Has this come direct to us or via POL?

I agree we need to get a rough estimate as Penny asks as this will probably be the first thing POL asks
for — let's get the estimate together and then have a chat.

POL is currently dealing with a couple of high profile prosecution cases and as per contract we are
assisting them. One of the defence teams has requested detail on all system changes; which is a

totally new request for us.

Could you please let me know (a) what you could provide and to what level of detail? And (b) how long
do you think it would take in man hours/man days?

I'm not sure whether this would be chargeable; I guess that depends on your response, but have
copied Guy in for guidance.

Would you have some time to discuss?
