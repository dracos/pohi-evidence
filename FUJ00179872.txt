Jason, Farzin,
There are some questions for the Sec Ops team in Torstein’s draft witness statement to which WBD are seeking

answers today, please.

Please see questions at the following sections:

1. 7.13

2. 7.13.4

3. 7,.14—not sure it is quite clear what is being looked for here, but see Alan Holmes’s comment on the same
section. Are you able to provide examples of other queries that are resolved using ARQs, i.e. other than
transaction data?

4. 11.3.2—do you have the records in terms of numbers of such users as described in 11.3.1 (as that is what is
being asked, rather than who they were)

5. 11.3.8—do you know the reason for this change of policy in July 2015? Is this process documented ina
Dimensions document so that we can just quote the reference?

Jonny,
I have now completed my pass through the document and attach a marked up version. There are clearly a number of
questions for others to address.

I have a concern that whilst we talk about the use of BTs in Horizon Online I don’t see any equivalent statement
about Legacy Horizon; on this I would have to rely on others in any case as I was not working within Fujitsu at that
time.

I will now go through the document yet again checking, but I think it makes sense to share it in its current state.

Regards etc
Torstein

Ibbett, Dave ; Andrew

Torstein,
Thank you for this. Re section 9, the Court will be determining the distinct issues set out below which means that I
don't think we can change the definition of access from read only to ability to change (as they are distinct issues):-
FUJ00179872
FUJ00179872

v Were Post Office and/or Fujitsu able to access transaction data recorded by Horizon remotely (i.e. not from
within a branch)?

vv Did Post Office and/or Fujitsu have the ability/facility to: (i) insert, inject, edit or delete transaction data or data
in branch accounts; (ii) implement fixes in Horizon that had the potential to affect transaction data or data in
branch accounts; or (iii) rebuild branch transaction data:

o atall;
© without the knowledge of the Subpostmaster in question; and
o without the consent of the Subpostmaster in question?

Let me know if you'd like a call to discuss.
Kind regards

Jonny,
Please find attached where I have got to. I have been through sections 1-8 and I don’t see any major problems in
there. I have suggested changes in a few places — as much to fit my style as anything else.

I have another session now and so whilst I may get more done today I thought I would let you have this as a WIP. In
any case I have most of tomorrow earmarked for this.

Could you agree this asa hope I have given you enough clues as to

why.

Regards etc
Torstein

Torstein,

Further to our exchange of emails earlier today please find attached an updated version of your statement. You'll see
that it contains some comments and questions for you in bold square brackets and some of the comments added by
your colleagues.

I'd be grateful if you'd review the draft in full and fill in the gaps as soon as possible. Will you be able to get it back to
me today please?

Kind regards
