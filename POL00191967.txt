e Fujitsu and Gareth Jenkins have for some time been providing POL with
expert witness statements and expert evidence for criminal prosecutions;

e A full report which considers Fujitsu and Gareth Jenkins’ provision of
expert evidence is being prepared;

e The initial view seems to be that statements and evidence provided by
Gareth Jenkins did not contain all that they should have done;

e In particular there seems to have been a reluctance to deal with known
Horizon issues in the statements/evidence;

e As aconsequence it has been necessary to conduct a review of cases so as

to determine whether or not any particular defendant has been prejudiced
by that absence of information.
