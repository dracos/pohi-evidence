Penny, did we ever raise an ARQ for these requests some time ago, if not I need to raise them
Officially for evidence for this case and I shall ask Maureen to raise them for me.

Further to my earlier note, can we make sure that we send the disks addressed to his wife, not him,
as he is the subpostmaster.

Thanks,

Kevin

Thanks for your help yesterday Helen.

Val Athwell has already been in touch asking for the records. We will have to give him the disks with

a covering note as you suggest.
I'll copy you both in to my reply.

Regards,

Kevin

Angela,

I have spoken to Mark Dinsdale this morning and he was only sent electronic copies of Ferndale Data
due to the urgency of the request. I have the original data in electronic form but as they are
questioning the data so much would it be best that we received the discs direct from Fujitsu probably
along with a confirmation that the data is accurate and not tampered with.

If they still want copies of all these discs or just the months in question could you please contact Mark
Dinsdale via Post Office Security inbox and he or one of his team in casework will hopefully be able
to obtain these. There is a cost with Fujitsu discs and each disc contains one month's data for both
transaction and events. I am not sure if we would incur extra costs with asking for hard copies of data
already received.

I hope the remainder of the meeting went well for you both and the outcome was what you were
looking for.

It was nice to meet you both and please let me know should you require anything else.

Regards,
