With many thanks for your assistance. Please find attached what eventually went.

However, we now understand that the Chair wants Second Sight to finalise their response with no more representations
from the Working Group.

Therefore would it be possible to draft me a further letter to Second Sight which deals not with the detail of Report
itself but:

- quality of work

- What we expect from professional accountancy firm

- what we have paid them and over what period

- why we have a right to expect a high quality product

- Terms of engagement and reserving our legal rights should the report issue as is (Rod said you would understand
exactly what that looks like)

Some of this is already in the letter you prepared before but this needs to be as strong as we can make it — we can also
water it down.

Would you be able to do that as a matter of urgency? Or so that we have something to go very early next week.

I understand that you are working from home but I can be reached on should you wish to discuss
