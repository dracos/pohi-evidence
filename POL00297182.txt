What we had initially believed to be perhaps one of the more difficult cases in fact turns out to be one of the
easiest. This defendant is awaiting his trial and accordingly has not been convicted and sentenced. Because
we are not the prosecutor our duty extends to the following:

1. Identify the name of the defendant;
2. Identify the prosecuting CPS area (Martin will do this);

3. Inform that CPS area of the existence of B14; that it has affected the Merthyr Dyfan branch; and
that a report is due soon;

4. Disclose the Second Sight report to the CPS once we have it.

If we follow this route the disclosure ‘ball’ will then be in the CPS court and our duty is satisfied. They will
know the defence being run and, if that defence is based on the proposition that Horizon may be
responsible, or if that is implicit in the defence (per Samra) then they will disclose. If not then they will not!

I think contact with the CPS should be made by us at this end so as to maintain a firewall between POL and
this overall problem; so that you are seen to be acting independently and transparently through lawyers;
and because we are in any event dealing with the other reviews.
