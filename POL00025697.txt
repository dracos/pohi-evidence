Dear Mrs Mc Alerney

I refer to my letter dated 19" January 2007 confirming the
suspension of your contract for services as subpostmaster of
Leitrim Post Office®.

After careful consideration I have decided to summarily
terminate your contract for services as Subpostmaster of
Leitrim Post Office® from the date of your suspension, on the
grounds that you failed to discharge the obligations placed
on you by your contract for services; Section 12 paragraphs
4 & 12 refers.

You may, if you wish, appeal against my decision. If it is
your intention to appeal, you should notify me, in writing
within ten working days (Monday to Friday) of receipt of this
letter. The format of the appeal can be either a personal
interview or written submission. Should you wish to progress
this avenue, I will arrange for the appeal to be heard by a
member of Post Office Ltd Appeals Authority.
