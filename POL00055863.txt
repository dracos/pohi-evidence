Preparation

With Counsel, discussing basis of plea and figure for costs. I had sight of the basis of
plea but counsel has it on his brief. Basically, accepting false accounting but not
theft. I saying that even if she brings a cheque today, we should ask for a
compensation order in case the cheque bounces! Saying if money repaid we would
not pursue POCA

Hearing.

Identified.

Defence explain that in the basis of plea it indicates the money has been repaid, but in

fact it hasn’t yet. It is in 2 bank account ready to be repaid. Asking for a Goodyear
indication.

Judge suggests that paying all the money back would be a main plank of mitigation,
but at this stage it hasn’t been done.

Defence — it will be.

T will adjourn this case until it has —‘many a slip twixt cup and lip’ The Post Office, I
imagine, want their money back. I will say that if it is paid back in full I will look
upon this defendant favourably. I will reserve the case to myself and adjourn until

15" December to give time for the cheque to clear so we know where we stand.
Better to have payment cut and dried. You can then mitigate on the basis of plea.

Defence — request Goodyear indication regardless of whether the money is paid back,
then we could perhaps assume a litle less if it was?

Defence — will Your Honour order a pre-sentence report.
Judge — I cannot order a PSR until a guilty plea has been entered

Defence ~ I know Your Honour is in Ipswich on 15™ December, would you consider a
date when you are next in Norwich.

Judge ~ No, you can come to Ipswich. I imagine you want the case reserved to me for
continuity.

Defence — well I don’t know about that, there won’t be any continuity if it’s in
Ipswich because I won’t be going there. I don’t do Ipswich.

Judge — aren't there trains?
Defence — Apparently so. I have a lot of commitments here.

Judge ~ Case adjourned for 14 days for the money to be repaid, to 15" December
2010. If money is repaid, that will be cause for optimism.

Unconditional bail.
