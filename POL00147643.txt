Belinda

Aside from including specific wording along the lines you have asked in the cover note, I assume you would want a brief
high level outline of what the main issue is (to the extent not covered in the specific wording) and what we intend to do by
way of end work product with reference to the more detailed outline sitting behind. Is that correct and is there anything
else you would want in the cover note?

Happy to discuss first thing tomorrow morning if easier.

A copy of the outline is attached.

Kind regards

Jonathan

Hi Jonathan
Apologies for the delay. We were at a meeting of the Working Group all day Friday.

It is our intention to provide comments on the ‘outline document' you and Christa gave us on Thursday. We hope to do
that on Monday.

l agree that the cover document setting out the nature of the commission should sit above the 'outline'document'. Both
may change slightly after the CEO has considered it.

I suggest you make a start of the cover sheet as that sets the context for what sits behind it. We will get back to you
tomorrow with some initial comments on the outline document.

We have a meeting with the CEO tomorrow so could we have a draft document to discuss with her for pm
tomorrow? We will give you any comments on the outline document in the mean time and we can give youa
consolidated set of feedback after the meeting with the CEO.

Does that make sense? Otherwise happy to have a chat first thing tomorrow(or later today if you would prefer).
One further point -do you have a soft copy of the ‘outline document’?

Thanks

Best wishes

I was wondering if you still envisage sending us comments on the outline document and having it ready for CEO approval
this evening?

One point I thought I should I clarify from your email below in case we (or I) have misunderstood. The outline document
we gave you yesterday was not intended to be a set of questions for you as such, but rather an outline of what we
envisage the report will cover. Apologies if that wasn’t clear. While we are obviously happy to include a cover note
setting out the commission based on the wording you provided below, we had envisaged that the document the CEO
would receive would be the cover note with the outline document sitting behind it, subject to any comments you had on
that document. In other words, we had understood that the outline document does set out at a high level what we will be
doing, subject to ensuring it is under cover of wording to reflect the commission. Is that what you are anticipating?

Many thanks

Jonathan

Many thanks. We will incorporate wording into a cover note to reflect the commission and await your comments on the
outline document before finalising it and getting it back to you for CEO approval tomorrow.

Kind regards

As discussed this morning, I have set out below the commission as set out in the Board minutes:

‘...., in respect of each individual application, the project team were taking extensive advice about Post Office’s
legal potential exposure. However, it was acknowledged that, in light of the facts now available, and the projected
level of claims and costs, it would be sensible to commission more generic legal advice on the overall level of
legal and financial exposure (taking into account the possibility of class actions) and steps that could be taken
to mitigate any exposure including considerations of alternative structures that might be available to deal with

POL-BSFF-0006766_0001
POL00147643
POL00147643

the mediation cases. Such advice should have regard to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, such as the
Financial Ombudsman Service.’

This needs to be reflected in the documentation you send us. I suggest a cover sheet to sit above the set of
questions you gave us this morning which sets out at a high level what you will do.

We will get back to you with any comments on the document you gave us. It would be helpful if you could let us
have something by close tomorrow which we could pass to our CEO for approval.

Best wishes
