POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY

FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF JAN DAVID TRUNDELL

I, lan David Trundell will say as follows:
Background

1. I went to Huddersfield polytechnic to complete an HND in

computer studies.

2. I've undertaken the standard professional background rising
through programmer, analyst, team leader, project manager then
architect and enterprise architect. I lost my CV so this is from my
poor memory.
a. From 1984- 1987 I worked as a programmer / analyst at
Sheffield insulations Ltd.
b. From 1987 - 2003 I was a Programmer / analyst at

Royal Mail.

c. I recollect that in 2003 IT staff were Outsourced to
business systems which was then split into developers
going to Xansa (operations staff went to CSC). Xansa
was taken over by Steria.

d. From 2005 to 2018 I worked at Post Office Ltd.

e. From 2005 to 2010 I worked as a solution
architect there.

f. In 2010 I worked as an enterprise architect.

g. In 2018 I took medical retirement following my stroke in

2017.

3. Since joining the Post Office I've completed a number of qualifications
including ISEB in project management, ToGAF, Prince2 and others but !

have no material to confirm the courses.

Background to your involvement with the Horizon IT Project.

4. I was working in Xansa on a number of projects when I was aware of
an opportunity to join the Horizon S90 project in 2005 as an architect. The
project was just about to start and I took the lead in the solution
assurance and design. This involved working closely with the Fujitsu
Design team of Allan Hodgkinson and Duncan Macdonald as well as the

Post Office team.

Horizon S90
5. The Horizon system consisted of capabilities that allowed Post Office to

introduce new products with minimal input from Fujitsu. This was a series
Page 2 of 15
WITN03890100
WITN03890100

of constructs that were called datatypes (APADC - Automated payments
advanced data capture) and kept costs of introducing transactions to a

minimum and the speed was relatively quick.

6. The one shortfall in APADC was that there was no capability to interact
with internal or external databases; S90 introduced a new datatype to
allow this called Generic online. Also introduced was a data store and
framework called APOP - Automated Payments Outpayments. This

allowed positive and negative payments.

7. The first product that was introduced was Postal Orders. The Postal
Order automation would treat the postal orders like cheques and move
away from the legacy solution. POs allowed a product to be purchased,

money given to clerk, and then cashed, money given to customer.

8. APOP had two tables called Primary and History. All interactions with
APOP could be configured to record history. This would be useful for each
product introduced as the history could be queried using the APOP Admin

enquiry function used by the APOP Admin team in Chesterfield.

9. At the heart of APOP was a data table, schema, that could be
configured for each product. There were 15 Alpha fields, 3 date fields, 3
numeric fields as well as a unique identifier called a Voucher id. For
postal orders alpha’ was used for payee name. The APOP solution was

configurable and gave PO transaction designers the capability to

Page 3 of 15
WITN03890100
WITN03890100

introduce products with minimal costs from Fujitsu (testing and

implementation were two costs).

10. The APOP solution was secure and only key support staff could
interrogate the database. Postal Orders could be up to £250 and the
database recorded the unique number from the MICR line and barcode on
the cheque. The solution had a secure method to interact in batch with the
clearing bank, COOP. This allowed people to deposit postal orders into
their bank. The Administration team would interact with the secure
printers (Smith and Ouzman) to bulk print postal orders. The printed
Postal Orders were worthless until activated on APOP via secure bulk

load or branch sale.

11. APOPs rules-based engine allowed the lifecycle to be defined e.g. not
existing, sold, cashed, archived. Where there are scenarios that are
exceptions, these can be defined and reported on e.g. sell to sell. Where

someone tries to cash twice this can raise an exception and reported on.

12. Once introduced APOP supported the products such as Stock

Ordering, bureau pre order, etc with minimal input from Fujitsu.

13. As the S90 solution allowed interaction with third party and post office
data stores there needed to be a capability that ensured the elements

were kept in sync.

14. The generic online datatype allowed external databases to be

referenced, an example of which was MoneyGram. Money could be sent

bege eae
WITNO03890100
WITNO3890100

from Post Office to receiving locations around the world. Without
documenting the whole solution, a new datatype recorded each planned
interaction with a third party. In the event of a break in communications,
for example, it would be possible to enter a recovery process to determine
how to proceed. This may have required a sub postmaster to call NBSC
and liaise with MoneyGram to determine if their database was updated.

The transaction may then be completed or cancelled etc.

15. The process was used for all transactions that had two data stores

that needed to be kept in sync.

16. I was engaged in the role of solution architect to assist in the review of
Fujitsu solutions e.g. APOP and to design Post Office solutions e.g.

APOP integration with COOP bank etc.

17. I worked closely with the POL security architect to ensure any solution
was robust. For example, the separation of concerns (duties) in the bulk
file Postal Order loads to ensure one person was not able to load postal
orders and encash them. A secure file delivery mechanism was
introduced with Smith and Ouzman. For Horizon S90 I was the solution
architect. I assured the Fujitsu solution and helped design capability in
Horizon. As the solution required a secure file delivery mechanism to
enliven bulk postal orders I worked with Smith and Ouzman to propose
and implement a secure client. The banking solution to clear the PO
cheques required a secure batch file process to extract and transform
MICR line details and validate against APOP.

18. I became an enterprise architect to look at the wider POL solutions
and ensure there were robust solutions that were used across the
Enterprise and avoiding point solutions. I was responsible for assuring the
Fujitsu solution as well as designing Post Office capability, e.g. COOP

bank interface.
Impact

19. I joined the Post Office projects at S90 and had no engagement in the
S80 Impact programme. EPOSS was a solution that existed and I had no

engagement in the capability.
Horizon Online

20. During HNGx I was not a tester but due to my solution and transaction
knowledge I was seconded to the testing team to help with transactions. I
helped the testing team to understand the new capability and supported
them during the test planning. I helped the pilot phase by representing the
programme in the north east as a project/testing interface. I recall a series
of meetings where the testing team demonstrated HNGx to

subpostmasters. My memory of the trip to the north east is limited.

21. A group session was held by the training team to share some news
about the changes coming in HNGx. I don't recall exact dates but the
training team should know. The local branches were invited to attend. The
training team will know who was invited. Some transactions were shown.

The emulator helped to run the transactions.

Page 6 of 15
22. I was engaged as a solution architect in the Horizon Online project. I
worked on the project to review technical solutions proposed by Fujitsu

and providing formal feedback on documents.

23. I have been asked to explain what the purpose of the RAG reports /
meetings were. They were to review the severity of incidents and allocate
a Red, Amber, Green status. Red was high priory, amber medium priority,

green was low, minor or cosmetic.

24. I have been asked a number of questions regarding the pilot and
rollout of Horizon Online. My memories of pilot and rollout is poor. I

cannot recall any specific issues.

25. I have been asked to consider a document titled OCP 25316

[POL00001568]. I have no recollection of this incident.

26. I cannot comment on what the pilot branches were told about (a) the
cause of the mismatch and (b) the proposed rectification as I have no

memory.

27. I have been asked to consider the Minutes of a Joint Tactical and
Strategic Meeting dated 14 March 2013 [POL00029471]. I have no
recollection of this incident and the meeting on 14 March 2012. I have
been asked to explain what “resilience” means in the context of these
minutes. Resilience models include multiple datacentres which could be

active-active, or active-passive. I recall the model used on HNGx was

Page 7 of 15

WITNO03890100
WITNO3890100
active-passive. In the event that the primary datacentre had an outage the

second data centre would be activated. I do not recall other detail.

28. I’ve reviewed POL00039120 but was not engaged in the definition of
any procedures for testing Horizon Online.
a. I recognise the principle of testing approach but cannot recall
any detail for the programme and how they evolved over time.
b. In my view, the project was run very well by Mark Burley, but I
cannot comment on how effective the system was for
monitoring and testing Horizon.
c. Ihave no view on how Fujitsu complied with its contractual

requirements in respect of testing.

29. I've reviewed POL00029487 but have no concrete memories of why in
April 2012, the Post Office sought to engage KPMG to complete an
architecture review of its IT systems. I don’t recall the trigger for the
review, but it made sense to have an independent view of the Horizon

Online solution.

30. Fujitsu designed the Horizon solution and Post Office assured it. The
review was to undertake an assessment that could consider the overall
solution and compare to best practices.
I think kit looked at :-

a. Scaleability - will the solution accommodate 30,000 concurrent

terminals?

Page 8 of 15

WITNO03890100
WITNO3890100

b. Resilience n+1 arch - if the major components require 4 elements,
then 4+1 are required;

c. Security - does the solution offer a high level of security?

d. Single points of failure - are there minimal points of failure that
have contingency measures?

e. Architecture - is the solution modern and in line with best/good
practice?

f. Data centre and servers active / passive - are the data centre
elements able to fail over entirely to the other data centre?

g. Constraints - differing connection methods, adsl, vsat, dial up,

mobile backup.

31. I cannot recall any detail about the utility of the proposed architecture

review by KPMG.
Training

32. I don’t recall being involved in training, but I did help to specify the
emulated responses for certain transactions where I had the expertise,
e.g. MoneyGram, APOP.
a. I wasn’t close to the training to describe the subpostmaster
engagement. I did represent the HNGx programme when the
training team visited the north east. The trainers were giving a
high-level overview of HNGx and I was on site to ensure it went
smoothly and provide and liaison with the project team if

needed.

Page 9 of 15
WITNO03890100
WITNO3890100

b. I was not engaged in the training scripts with subpostmasters
and I'm not aware of how this may have figured in the system
design

c. Iwas not directly involved in the definition of the training but
was engaged in the specification of some emulated responses.
This was taken into account by the training team when defining
training scenario.

d. Ihave been asked whether, looking back, there is anything I
think ought to have been done differently in the provision of
training to Horizon users. I’m not sure if there were expert users
that were engaged in training, but if not this may have been
useful. I've come across Users who know all transactions inside
out. They recognise which transactions are required to be run
during the different balance periods, and more importantly know
where to look when there are discrepancies.

e. Having such an expert that can represent the challenges faced
by a branch as well as understanding what HNGx has to offer

would be of benefit to both parties.

Stock adjustments project

33. I have been asked questions about the Stock Adjustments Project. I
have no memory of the project scope. I have read the Back Office
Efficiency Programme — Stock Adjustments Project Definition Document

dated 19 March 2010 [POL00001697] but cannot recall any detail.

Page 10 of 15
WITNO03890100
WITNO3890100

34. I have been asked what my involvement in this project was and
whether it was implemented. I do not recall. The document is only version
0.1 which suggests a draft. Baseline documents are whole numbers e.g.

1.0.

Design and function of receipts, print-outs and other reports from Horizon

35. This is not something I was close to. The documents explain what a
sub postmaster could report on. I have no view as my knowledge and

memory is limited/ unreliable.

Bugs, errors and defects

36. I have been asked what role I had in identifying, rectifying or
monitoring bugs, errors or defects in the Horizon IT System. Bugs were
identified and logged by the Horizon/ Fujitsu testing teams (I think). My
recollection is that the joint team would review the issue and allocate a
RAG status. The bugs would be monitored and reviewed regularly to
ensure they were being progressed and had the correct priority. I was
engaged as part of the review team working alongside the testers,

security architect.

37. I have considered POL00022840. I was not aware of any issues or

problems with the Horizon system, in particular bugs, errors or defects.

Page 11 of 15
WITNO03890100
WITNO3890100

38. I’m unaware who received information about issues or problems with

the Horizon system, e.g. bugs, errors or defects.

39. I do not recall how the knowledge about issues and problems with the
Horizon system was dealt with subpostmasters or Post Office managers

or assistants working in Post Office branches.

40. The document POL00001935 is regarding a recovery incident. The
terminal had frozen prompting a call to the helpdesk. I do not recall any

specifics, but Postal Order values cannot be less than zero.

41. I have considered the document POL00001935, I do not recall this

incident or the reason/resolution.

Receipts and Payments Mismatch Bug

42. I have considered FUJ00081584: I have no recollection of this incident

or meetings.

Clock time synchronisation

43. I have been asked about clock time synchronisation, and I have
considered POL00002192 and POL00002159. I have no memory of the
clock issue. Peter Laycock may have knowledge: but I do not recall any

detail.
