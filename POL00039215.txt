Branch Support Programme - CS
Background

To address the concerns of some subpostmasters over recent years about

Horizon, the Post Office commissioned forensic accountants, Second Sight in 2012
to undertake an independent review of the cases.

The interim report was published in July 2013 and whilst the report identified
that there were no systemic issues with the Horizon system, it suggested that

Post Office should examine the training and support offered to it subpostmasters.

As a result the Branch Support Programme was established to review
the lifecycle of the subpostmaster’s experience with Post Office; to “fix” the issues
identified in the Second Sight report and the subsequent mediation cases and

to ensure any lessons learnt are factored into future ways of working.

Branch Support Programme - CS
Background

¢ One of the issues the report highlighted the following:

¢ Lack of timely, accurate and complete information provided to
subpostmasters to support them in resolving issues

¢ Lack of centralised data or files specific to each branch which hinders a
quality investigation from taking place.

The investigation undertaken by the Programme highlighted/confirmed the following
issues:

¢ Inconsistent record keeping by internal teams or contact made with branches
¢ Inconsistent quality of information retained by teams

e Lack of consistent processes or workflows between different teams within a
process

¢ Lack of timescales to resolve branch issue, coupled with lack of monitoring of

issues (>

Slide 7 Notes

The branch is required to go to the supplier direct. No visibility is given to the types of branches who are experiencing equipment issues.

Escalation points will also be Area Sales Managers, Post Office personnel, Senior Stakeholders, NBSC, Crown Management and Paula etc. Once
it gets escalated, the issue resolution usually ends up in Dave Hulbert's area.

Branches going through the Network Transformation Programme and Crown Transformation are project managed. The main people who get
involved here are the FCA, the NCA and RLB. If there are multiple partner branches going through the process then there is also an
implementation manager involved in the process.

How can we resolve this? >

The role of the Programme will be to embed the guiding principles into all teams
supporting the network, which are:

eStand in the subpostmaster’s shoes
*Treated with dignity and respect
*Right first time

The Programme will be looking at a number of improvement activities across the
organisation. However, underpinning this is the need for a common IT platform to
be used across all teams supporting or having interactions with our branches, to

create one branch view.

Purpose of today is to capture the requirements or the relevant teams across the
business to ensure the business can make an informed decision about the options
available and a fit for purpose tool is implemented.

Structure of the 1° session >

Each group to spend 45 minutes focusing on two of the following 6 “functional
requirement” categories which will then be fed back to the wider group

¢ Workflow — processing requests — how would we want the system to manage
processes, especially between different teams?

¢ Access rights- who would we want to use the system, and how?

¢ System/data integration — which other systems and data would it need to talk
to?

e Management Information — what types of things would we need to report on?

¢ Records/audit — what would the system need to do in terms of keeping records
and accessing information?

¢ Evolution/design — what would our requirements be if our internal processes
changed?
