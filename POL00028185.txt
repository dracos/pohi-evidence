1 INTRODUCTION

The PDA and Pathway have jointly reviewed the Programme Master Plan for the
delivery of Release 1 of the Pathway Services and the Authorities Service
Environment. The re-plan has aimed to minimise risks to the Programme objectives
by phasing the implementation of the Release 1 Services through four intermediate
releases. These are respectively:

Release A - Continuation of the IGL Service for CAPS 2.0 & CAPS 2.1
Release 1B- Roll-out of an OBCS Service

Release 1C-  Roll-out of a BPS Service

Release 1D - Conversion of the BPS Service to CAPS version 2.2
Release IE- The planning name for Release I functionality.

The phases have been designed to intercept the phased availability of the Service
Environment including CAPS, DSS OBCS, TIP, ABED, Reference Data and HAPS.

Attached in Appendix A is the agreed High Level rollout plan, which details Post
Office Rollout of Stream A, Stream B, and Stream C. These are detailed in the
following sections.

2 PURPOSE

This document together with its attachments proposes the plan which is intended to
reflect the recent discussions between the PDA and Pathway. It describes the contents
of the four intermediate releases and the relationships between the releases. It also
describes the Authorities’ Responsibilities and the time scales that must be achieved
in order that the overall time scale can be met.

4 RELEASE 1A

4.1 OBJECTIVE OF RELEASE

The objective of Release 1A is to enable the continuation of the IGL service at the 10
existing IGL Outlets while utilising payment authorisation data delivered first from
the CAPS release 2.0 system and later from the CAPS release 2.1 system.

4.2 RELEASE OVERVIEW

The IGL Service is unchanged with respect to the functions and services provided to
Users at Outlets.

The Services are provided only at the existing IGL outlets.
Payment authorisation data is provided by CAPS release 2.0.

The Pathway CAS service is modified to provide an interface which is compatible
with CAPS release 2.0. The IGL business functionality is retained is retained without
changes.

Service Level statistics continue to be provided from PAS & CMS to the POCL
ABED system.

Pathway will undertake Technical Tests of the release with the support of the PDA.
The release is not subject to Model Office testing or Live Trial testing.

The CAPS 2.1 interface is unchanged from CAPS 2.0 and so the Pathway Services do
not any require modification. With Pathway’s assistance the Authorities will
undertake regression testing of the CAPS Release 2.1 release before it is used for the
live IGL service.

The Data Centre will be located at Feltham.

5 RELEASE 1B

5.1 OBJECTIVE OF RELEASE 1B

The objective of Release 1b is to provide improved control of the fraudulent use of
Order Books service based upon a subset of the OBCS Service provided at 200
Outlets.

5.2 RELEASE OVERVIEW

The full OBCS Service is closely integrated with EPOSS, however the EPOSS
functionality is not required within Release 1b. A software “shell” is developed
which enables OBCS to operate independently from EPOSS.

Given the absence of EPOSS, the Outlets continue to use manual accounting
techniques.

The DSS OBCS system delivers Control Notice data to the Pathway OBCS Access
Service.

OBCS Reference data is provided to Pathway on magnetic disc and is processed
manually by Pathway.

The ten IGL Outlets which are installed with the Release la based Service remain
operational on Release la and are not migrated to Release 1b.

The Data Centre will be located at Feltham.

7 RELEASE 1D

7.1 OBJECTIVE OF RELEASE 1D

The objective of Release Id is to regression test the Card based benefit payment
Services provided in Release Ic so that it works together with CAPS release 2.2. This
service, after upgrading the Ic outlets, will be implemented at an additional 450
outlets, Stream B (Appendix A), as agreed in the High Level Rollout Plan. These
additional outlets will only use OBCS functionality, whilst the original 200 outlets use
full OBCS/BPS functionality.

7.2 RELEASE OVERVIEW

The Benefit Payment Service consisting of CMS, PAS and BES is regression tested
using CAPS Release 2.2.
The Release 1c Services and business functionality are retained.

The Data Centre will be located at Wigan.

Release Id is a simple extension of Release 1b it is proposed that the same Project
Managers manage both releases.

7.5 ROLL-OUT

Release Id is rolled out to the Outlets that are currently operating on Release lc and
then to an additional 450 new non-automated outlets, as agreed in the High Level
Rollout plan. These outlets are referred to as Stream B (Appendix A).

8 RELEASE 1E

8.1 OBJECTIVE OF RELEASE 1E

During the re-plan discussions between Pathway and the Authorities the designation
Release le has been used to mean the functionality of Release I as delivered to the
Live Trial stage of Operational Trial. When Release le has been Accepted by the
Authorities then that release is designated Release 1 and starts National Roll-out.

The objective of Release le is to integrate the PAS, CMS, BES, OBCS Services that
were delivered in Release Id together with the EPOSS, APS and enhanced MIS
Services.

Release le is rolled out to a maximum of 1750 Outlets by the end of Live Trial.

8.2 RELEASE OVERVIEW

The Benefit Payment Service (BPS) continues to operate with CAPS 2.2.
The BPS Service is re-integrated with the EPOSS service.

The OBCS Service is integrated with the EPOSS Service.

The automated Reference Data System is integrated with the EPOSS Service.
The Service Level Statistics reports are now provided by MIS.

APS is introduced to operational use for the first time utilising the POCL HAPS
system.

EPOSS is introduced to operational use for the first time and is integrated with the
APS, BPS and OBCS Services.

Release le is implemented at the Outlets which are operational on Release 1d. A
subset of 200 of these Outlets, together with an additional 100 automated Outlets (i.e.
an outlet equipped with ECCO or AP equipment) will be selected for monitoring
within the Live Trial stage of the Operational Trial.

The Stream B outlets are upgraded to release le, but will only operate OBCS
functionality.

The Stream B outlets will require their functionality restriction to be removed and
undergo a full training upgrade prior to the implementation of Release 2 in 1998.

An additional 1000 outlets, Stream C, will have full Release le functionality
implemented before completion of Live Trial.

Upon Acceptance of the Release 1 Services National Roll-out of the Services
commence.

The Data Centre will be located at both Wigan & Bootle.
