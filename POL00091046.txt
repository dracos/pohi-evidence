Audit of Post Office® Hightown, Branch Code 512323.

On the 3™ September 2010, accompanied by my colleague Richard Cross, I conducted
an audit of the above named branch. The audit had been arranged as Tracey Bedford,
Migration Support Officer, had found the cash to be short by £13624.41 the previous
day and had therefore closed the office pending our visit.

The purpose of this audit was therefore to verify financial assets due to the Post
Office®.

The audit revealed a shortage in the branch of £14842.37. A breakdown of the audit
result and details of the audit findings are as follows:

1357734 (-

We arrived at the branch at 13.00 pm and introduced ourselves to the Postrnaster
Miss Alison Hall and advised that we were to perform an audit on behalf of Post Office
Ltd®.

Miss Hall allowed us access to the secure area, and was present in the secure area
whilst the audit was carried out.

Miss Hall said the loss had occurred due to Lottery accounting problems and produced

a report from Lottery Accounting Chesterfield detailing errors ( mainly activations on
the Lottery terminal not ali being rernitted in on the Horizon system ) going back 18

months. She had been accepting the Transaction Corrections, adjusting the instants on
hand back down to the correct figure but not putting any money in to compensate. The
Trading Statement copies printed (originals unreadable) all show a clear balance and
Miss Hall stated these were adjusted to show clear before rolling over. Cash
declarations together with snapshots produced indicate ONCH falsely declared for
some considerable time. {A selection of these I have retained for forwarding as
advised.) A call to Chesterfield revealed further Transaction Corrections due for -
£819.00 mainly for Instants not remitted in. Three of these were found with no
remittance advice attached to prove to Miss Hall the information supplied was correct.

The audit was completed revealing numerous discrepancies to stock and starnps on
the Horizon snapshot in addition to the cash discrepancy. The audit loss on the day
was £14842.37 which together with the amount of £819.00 for Transaction
Corrections pending brings the Trading Position deficit to £14842.37

Miss Hall was then advised that she should satisfy herself that the figures of the audit
team were correct. Therefore, we asked Miss Hall if she would do her own independent
count of all the cash on hand again. She said she had watched me count the cash and
was happy the figure was correct. I double checked the stock recorded by my colleague.

Miss Hall then confirmed that the figures of the audit team were correct.
I then telephoned you at 16.30pm to report the shortage.

I also notified Andrew Daley, Fraud Team Manager on 3 September 2010 to relay
these findings.

The decision taken was to precautionary suspend Miss Hall and the assets were
secured in safe until a relief could be found and the keys taken by myself along with
the alarm code that had been changed.

No Compliance Tests were carried out at this audit.
