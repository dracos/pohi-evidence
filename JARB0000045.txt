Phone call — Ian Henderson

20 March 2013

Follow-up to Ian’s meeting with the Post Office (Susan Layton (?), head of legal, and Alwen
Lyons, company secretary) following JNA meeting with Alice Perkins yesterday, Tuesday 19
March.

Lead-up to meeting, Monday 25 March, 5pm, Room N, PCH.
Issues to discuss:

1. Is there any clear evidence available yet that would make any prior
conviction unsafe?

e Post Office reaction to preliminary findings — they don’t believe anything is
wrong with Horizon (they are ready if processes (training, helpdesk, etc.) will
need refinement)

e Need to clarify in JNA’s mind what it is in thematic terms that Second
Sight says is happening

2. Need to be clear what ought / ought not be reported in the meeting on
Monday
« Post Office very concerned that any opinion being formed by Second
Sight at this stage is being communicated
« PO stance — Second Sight should not be expressing an opinion, not least
as PO hasn't had right of reply

3. Proposal to focus on 2 cases and produce a result that could then drive
process forward
e Longevity of investigations — concern coming from MPs and Post Office
« (Mike Wood MP‘s comment on when is this going to end, Alice Perkins’
comment on limit of Post Office willingness to continue funding
investigations)

4. Deadline for cases
a. Alice mentioned end of February. This is news to JNA and will be news to
MPs
