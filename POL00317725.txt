THIS CALL IS FOR NETWORK TEAMS

The conference call is on Wednesday 24 June at 9.30am.

We expect further media coverage in the next few days about allegations relating to the
Horizon system and unsubstantiated claims about it causing losses to a small number of
former postmasters. Our Communications Director, Mark Davies, would like to brief you on
the issue so that you are able to answer questions if the issue is raised.
