Subject: JFSA - Delegated Authority for Key Decisions - Proposal - Legally Privileged and In Confidence
Attachment: 13 140ct11 POL IC DelegAuthRequest.doc

I have spoken with Stephen Hirst in terms of the delegated authority approach given the potential costs that could
arise.

Following that conversation I have drafted the attached note in anticipation of submitting such a paper to POL IC. We
will need clear delegated authority from the Exec and most likely an explicit Exec Sponsor who would be the decision
maker or would be part of a group like ours making the decision.

I have a call out to Kevin Gilliland to discuss his thoughts on his sponsorship of this.

I would appreciate your thoughts on the current estimate and worst case estimates of legal costs in this matter. I know
that is hard to indicate, however, POL IC will require figures with narratable assumptions around them in order to
enable a governance process which delegates authority around expenditure. It would not be within POL expenditure
processes for us to believe we had cast in stone the authority to spend during this afternoons meeting.

I have left a message with you Paul as I believe this paper needs to be led by POL (and so with mine, Kevins, your
input in submitting it) but with input on cost ranges from Emily and Rebekah.

Hope that makes sense
Thanks, Rod
