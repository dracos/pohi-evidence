Janet

Thanks for your help with this

Our current thinking is that we will issue a single report that deals with all the thematic issues that are
identified. In addition, each sub-postmaster and MP will be issued with an appendix dealing with the specific

issues they have raised.

We expect that the thematic report will address the high level issues being raised by sub-postmasters and it
will then be up to POL and possibly the Courts to decide how to respond.

No guarantees, but that’s our current thinking!
Happy to consider other ideas from you and James.
With best wishes
