‘un ul dul, = Aug Aug Sep Sept,

Whilst these graphs show a far higher incidence of non-polling on Monday , it is pleasing to

note that the number of non-polled outlets has not grown in relation to rollout

Server problems : w/c 24" July & 21* August (See Graph above)

ICL believe the issues around correspondence servers will not recur now that the Data Centres
are running the new version of Riposte, but have provided nothing concrete to back this up.

Stephen Muchow (ICL) has been asked to provide a written statement. In the meantime, ICLP
have been made aware that we are not satisfied with the content of the report and that we will

therefore be sending them a formal response.

Non Polled Offices (Problem No. 10000073)

The final version of ICL's call script for contacting offices has been agreed and is being,
implemented 03/10/00.

The volume and duration of incidents is causing, major concerns within PON; this has been
communicated to ICL, who are escalating their weekly "war-room" with suppliers. The rate of
non-polling among CSR+ offices is alarming (7% as opposed to 1% in the rest of the live
estate).

Work is still ongoing in ICL to provide a way of harvesting marooned transactions from non-
polling offices; the original proposal to replace the gateway PC with a “replica” is deemed not
to be operationally practical.

ICL Pathway has decided that the temporary satellite connection is the most suitable option
for the recovery of “marooned” transactions , they are looking towards progressing this action
quickly. It is intended to use this option only in exceptional circumstances to recover
transactions that become marooned at outlets. Agreement still has to be reached with PON
regarding the activation of this process.

Family tax credit introduction to OBCS : (Problem 100000286)

Offices were unable to input Inland Revenue Working Families Tax Credit dockets into the
Horizon system. This caused a considerable increase in the number of calls to both helplines
during the week commencing 18' September. (NBSC received an extra 1,700 calls over a three
day period while HSH received an extra 2,700 dealing, with the same incident).

Root cause of the problem

. Offices had not read the Counter News article (Week 25, article 10).

Offices had read the Counter News article, but rang the Network Business Support Centre
rather than refer to the Horizon System User Guides as instructed.
Initial analysis of the problem had shown that the root cause was not the primary problem.
i.e. : Software download failure.
Failure to receive the software download by offices. 2 via the NBSC and 15 via the ICL
Pathway Non-polling report.
The Counter News article that communicated this change excluded the detailed procedures
on how to handle OBCS transactions as it was felt that offices were already performing
these transactions for the Benefits Agency and would be fully conversant with them.
An Interactive Voice Response Message was left on the NBSC phone line to refer offices to
the HSH for navigational advice. A number of calls were bounced back from HSH to the
NBSC.

Effect of the problem

OBCS Stop list not being utilised

Increased workload for NBSC / Horizon System Helpdesk (resulting in possible
degradation of service to agents)

ICL Pathway offered no system solution to input the transactions where the software
download had failed, necessitating an ATP. The only suggested ATP from ICL Pathway
was to utilise the Suspense Account, which impacts on the client, reconciliation and
Transaction Processing. The ATP had to be implemented at 14 offices.

Next Steps

The issues around the communication of this change (1, 2 and 5 above) in Counter News.
will be addressed by the work done by Mark Burley in the Outlet Documentation Review.

Work surrounding the non-polling issue (number 4 above) is currently being progressed
with ICL Pathway. This is an existing problem and is receiving urgent attention.

The helpdesks issues (number 3 and 6 above) will be taken forward by the NBSC manager
to address with his opposite number at ICL Pathway.

BSM Business Continuity Management

There are concerns within 2 areas of BSM regarding the progress of the CSR+ Pilot. BSM
Problem and BSM Change Management have been on Amber for 3 weeks of the pilot
because they continue to be under pressure in terms of resource to manage it due to
increasing numbers of Problems and ATPs respectively. If the current trends continues
they would not be ready to leave pilot.

There are now 21 problems open in relation to CSR+.
© 6 of these are in relation to LFS

* 7 of these are AP related problems

Problems managed by ICL Pathway

Seven relate to APS ( P10000269, 287, 293, 294, 296, 297 & 298 ). These are either new
problems or the incidents have become more frequent since CSR+ was introduced. Pathway
had recognised the problems and started to investigate them before TP formally raised the
incidents as Problems.

The problems cover data integrity ( reconciliation errors ), corrupt validation files, delayed
transactions and missing files ( repaired files causing normal files to be rejected because of
duplication). They impact on our ability to reconcile payments to Clients, provide product
breakdowns and meet SLA timescales.

Problems opened since the end of the month may call into question the stability of the system

* the number of critical NT error messages

Comments,

1, First tranche of staff up to May 2000 appointed from an internal panel. These staff were allocated to individual teams for clearing the increased number of
errors from Horizon offices. Additional staff being picked in June 2000 onwards from the external recruitment exercise.

2. Although the length of the learning curve used has increased to week 30 after conversion, the latest forecast of extra staff required this year are stil in line
with the original forecast. This is due to applying the improved average error clearance rates achieved in TP.

3. The latest forecast is based on the error rate for Horizon offices returning to the manual baseline by 30 weeks after conversion. 2nd forecasts for extra
staff required if learning curve extended to 40 weeks before retuming to the baseline removed.

4, More staff will be required at the end of the roll out timetable for extra on-going work on Horizon offices ( e.g. completing table 12 parcel income figures,
clearing manual amendments and fomer subposmasters accounts).

= This is a revised learning curve based on errors produced in the last 15 weeks at Horizon offices. The height of this curve is not as severe during the early stages after
conversion as that originally used in Janary 2000. Errors produced per office in the 1st weeks after conversion, based on the last offices to go live, are shown in the table
below.

- The length of the current learning curve is 20 to 30 weeks. The mid period figures for weeks 7 to 15 remain well above the baseline. Figures for weeks 15 to 30 at the tail of
the learning curve, now increasingly based on the results of offices rolled out since Christmas, show an improvement on earlier offices.

- From the latest information available for converted offices, the learning curve is assumed to return to the manual baseline after 30 weeks.

The main cause of the problem is that many tables on the Cash Account are not mandatory for completion and some postmasters are

realising this once the account has been printed, thus the information has not been captured.

Impact

™ Extra resource needed to input data into the system.
™ Client Information distorted if not completed.

The chart above shows the following curves:

¢ NRO- national rollout before Christmas 1999

© NRO1 - national rollout in January and February
* NRO2- national rollout in March and April

The coping curve only has 5 weeks of data due to the delay in getting reliable
data on errors.

The curve for NRO2 is higher than for NRO1. This is mainly due to the
number of calls made to HSH and the time to balance.

The time to balance is a small sample size due to the expense of calling offices
and the inconvenience caused by calling in when they've first migrated.

The charts overleaf show the individual attributes which make up the outlet

know the correct helpline to call with system failures. The figures regarding,
help on Post Office business however show that 31.8% of people either
consult their documentation and phone HSH or just phone HSH first rather
than the NBSC, Alarmingly only 4.2% of people actually said they would
phone the NBSC first with PO business , compared to 23.4% who would

The graph above shows that the level of Sub Postmaster resignations has
remained relatively stable despite the continuing rollout of Horizon. At the
beginning of September 1999 there were only 323 offices on Horizon by
September 2000 this figure had risen to 12,000 offices yet there does not
appear to be any sharp increases in the levels of Sub Postmaster resignations.
While some Sub Postmasters have stated the introduction of Horizon as
reason for their resignation ; it appears that overall levels of resignations are
not out of the ordinary. In fact when a line of best fit is drawn through the

points the levels of SPMR resignations actually seem to be reducing, over time.

In September 2000 there was an increase in complaints logged at the Network

Business Support Centre (NBSC), about the service provided at the NBSC,

local cash distribution centres and Swindon Parcelforce Worldwide Logistics.

The fuel crisis and CSR+ upgrade remittance pouch problems have generated

an increase in local cash distribution centre and stores complaints

There has also been a growth in complaints regarding incorrect advice being
given at the NBSC. 58 complaints were logged by NBSC customers stating
they were given incorrect advice and 60% of these were investigated by the
Customer Relations Team. Changes to the knowledge base (system used by

advisors to find solutions to customer queries) have been implemented where

nect

It is interesting to note the number of ICL Pathway and Horizon System
Helpdesk (HSH) complaints have decreased slightly. A total of 94 HSH
complaints and 53 ICL Pathway complaints were logged in September.

ary and reminders are issued to all staff about the importance of using
the knowledge base and not relying on their own knowledge.

The HSH have recently introduced a Service Control Team, who are
dedicated to identifying areas where their level of service is falling below the

standards they expect to provide.

The graph above shows the performance of POCM for the month of September. In this graph the effect of the Family Tax

problem (P10000286) can clearly be seen. The problem originated on the 18" September , resulting in SLA failures for 3 days.

From the 18 - 20% September an ACD voice message was added to the NBSC telephone number in an attempt to advise
customers of the situation and actions to take, As a result customers heard the message and rang off thereby increasing the
abandoned rate. Accordingly due to the length of the message , the number of calls answered in 15/60 seconds reduced
significantly. (see graph above).

Operational Performance

The three main ACD type SLA measures were not achieved in September (calls abandoned & percentage abandoned in
15/60 seconds). This was mainly due to the increased calls received for Inland Revenue changes and enquiries relating, to

the fuel crisis. The first quarterly Customer Satisfaction results were presented during September and the overall
satisfaction rate was above 85%. Whilst this is a tremendous achievement work is continuing on an improvement plan to
further improve the level of service.

Progress is being made on “efficiency measures” and the key elements of these measures are already being tracked with

improvements to be made by December. Running parallel! to efficiency measures is the drive to ensure the quality of
responses is tracked and measured across the NBSC. A workshop is to be held in October to determine the way forward

This problem caused average calls to rise above their linear average for the first time since May. The graph also
shows how call levels returned to normal during the following week. (The troughs in the graph 17-23 April & 29
May - 4 June are caused by Bank Holidays when a lower number of calls were received).

The level of calls to Regional helplines has continued to fall as offices become automated and therefore phone the
NBSC instead of their regional helplines. Average calls rose steeply during, the w/c 18t* September , this can be put
down to the familiy tax credit problem and people phoning their regional helplines due to problems getting
through to the NBSC. Average calls fell back in line with expectations the following week 25/09/00.

With effect from week ending 30‘ September the regional helpdesk at Tunbridge Wells has now closed.

The piechart shows that there has been an 6% increase in calls relating to “client counter
procedures” since the start of the year. Horizon calls have recently been split to include

Horizon Balancing as a separate call category. This helps to explain the fall in Horizon calls

and the rise in Horizon Balancing calls.

Note : That in September 1% of calls concerned CSR+ Outlets which did not migrate onto

the CSR+ system until 4 September 2000. This will be monitored again October to see if the

percentage of calls has remained constant in relation to CSR+ rollout.

DATE

The graph shows that during the w/c 18/09/00 the average number of calls rose above the linear average to date for the first time
since June 2000. This can be explained by the Family Tax problem (P0000286) which caused a surge in calls during the week
The drops in call volumes at the beginning/end of May and last week of August are caused by Bank Holidays.

The charts show that the categories have remained fairly stable this month when
compared to year to date figures. Exceptions occur in categories “other” and
“Operational” , this is because new categories such as “inappropriate” and “training”

have been set up since the start of the year . These are calls which used to be classed as
“other” .

The graph shows that the main area for concern is the rising number of people who had
increasing difficulty during April and May. The reason for the increase in people failing to
get through to HSH was due to the surge in calls at the end of April and beginning of May
regarding revaluation. This issue had been resolved by June hence the fall in complaints in
this category. The introduction of IVR (Interactive Voice Recognition) by HSH at the
beginning of June may also have helped to reduce complaints in this category.

Business Impact
Sue Siowart and Adele Kileoyne: Business Service Management

Background
The business impact model is a tool which will enable the ICL Pathway Service
Level Agreements (SLA’s) to be assessed from a business wide perspective by
PON. The business impact scores will show how any SLA failures are affecting
the Network and where the most pain is felt.

The model is derived from matrices which contain scores based on the
percentage failure of the SLA against the number of offices affected. The model
will allow comparison between the SLA results on an even scale rather than
identifying which SLA’s have failed by the biggest margin. The matrices are
divided into four key areas of the business which are impacted by ICL
Pathway’s performance (customer, support, client and outlet) and from these an
overall score is produced for each SLA.

Scores
The scores are as follows:

100 shows that the SLA was achieved to the agreed minimum acceptance
threshold.

Scores above 100 shows that the SLA target has been exceeded by ICL
Pathway therefore having a positive impact on the business

Scores below 100 show the extent to which the SLA has failed based on the
impact on the business. The historical data will enable decisions to be taken
based on sustained failure rather than reacting to ‘blips’.

A score of 0% show that the failure of the SLA is totally unacceptable to PON
and should be the focus for immediate action to improve the SLA results.
N/A means that ICL Pathway are not currently reporting on these SLA’s.

.

Although the matrices scores have been agreed across the business it should be
noted that this is currently a learning model. As such the scores may be subject
to change if the impact is considered to have a greater or lesser impact than the
results suggest.

Results

© The table below shows the business impact for the past 6 months. The key
impacts on the business are the Service Level Agreement failures for file and
data deliveries by Day D and Business Incidents which have had a
consistently unacceptable score for the past 7 months.

This month the performance against a number of other SLA’s has worsened,
calls answered within 20 and 40 seconds have been impacted by the surge of
calls relating, to Family Tax Credit.

Traffic Light System

Each CSF has at least one measure attached to it. These are shown in
blocks and each block of measures are weighted at 100%. If all are
equally important in the block the 100% is divided across the block of
measures. This system works well in areas like OSG where there are
distinct differences in the importance of each measure. The traffic lights
are then used to show the total of the weighting. For example if a CSF
has a number of low graded measures on red but the higher ones are all
on green this suggests that there are no major issues affecting the CSF
and therefore the overall traffic light for that CSF would be green.
However in Transaction Processing, all the CSF’s are equally important
which means that if any of the measures are adversely affected the
impact is high on TP.
