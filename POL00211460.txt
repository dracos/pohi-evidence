Agree with all that has been said.

My only point would be around a UQ. This would only be good if we were absolutely sure where the minister would end up. Part of
the problem we have is the way in which SS were held up as key to process in the parly statement last year.

also agree with Jane that we should avoid appeasing or giving the impression of appeasing JA. We have nothing to apologise for, we
are trying hard to play the game fairly and have gone considerably further than any other large corporate might in similar
circumstances (with the benefit of hindsight, far, far too far). He, on the other hand, is being less than reasonable - even in his
absurd chasing of Paula and the rudeness of his office.

and fair, demonstrably reasonable (so as to guard against potential legal challenge), with an independent element and which costs
considerably less (what wouldn't?).

>On I. I think the letter as drafted does the trick but, in view of Alice's comments whether Paula offers him a call in the first
instance as since his letter his office has emailed twice, Ron has asked for a meeting which he claims to be doing at James’
instigation and he has emailed Alice. A call will allow Paula to get some matters on the record without the possibility of turning up
to a meeting with Second Sight and JFSA and some hostile MPs and know opportunity to have a frank discussion with JA. The call
could be quite robust. We have lines.

>On 2. I suggest Alice simply responds to say she is sorry that he felt the need to email her in those terms knowing that PV is on
holiday and stating a view to her without having heard what Paula has to say. She knows that Paula will pick this up on her return
and she would hope he would give her an opportunity to do so before taking any action.

>

> On 3. I really don't think Paula should meet Ron. I think that I should go back to Ron and say that Paula has asked Chris to deal
with this matter as he is the Senior responsible director. He will keep her appraised accordingly. Chris will remind Ron of the ToRs
and his engagement letter and ask that he raises his concerns in the first instance at the Working Group and also informs the
Working Group of his conversations with JA.

investigations and mediations and it is not appropriate at this stage any more than it would be to debate cases going through the
Courts.

discussion on the cases we did not reach last week. If they decline to participate in the Working Group then we would need to
consider that in light off the terms of their engagement. I plan to chase Ron about dates tonight.
