London EC1V 9HQ

A rather belated note — I am sorry — of thanks for agreeing to meet earlier this month to
talk about the problems subpostmasters and mistresses appear to have been having over
the last few years with the Horizon system. I feel rather bad coming to you about this so
early in your tenure, but it is a matter that is affecting a large number of people throughout
the country.

I shall wait to hear from you about your thoughts on how best to proceed. I am grateful to
you for lending a willing ear.
