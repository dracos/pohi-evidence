Key Risks & Issues Summary

® Key Risks

Key fixes for Business Ref Data
distribution do not get through
testing in time and compromise our
ability to support rollout (in test
currently, due for sign-off 02/07/10)

Rapid pace of introduction and
volume of fixes could regress the
solution

Further significant live issues may
result in the rollout being delayed
again and/or Post Office requesting
HNG-X is regressed

Post Office will not be able to
achieve the beat rate of 265
branches per night, leading to
delays in the rollout completion
(under review — may transfer to
issue w/c 05/07/10)

w Key Issues

% High Volume of Hot fixes in addition
to maintenance fixes leading to
testing bottleneck & delays in
implementation.
