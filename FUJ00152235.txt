1 Introduction

This document is intended to assistin the management and delivery of the service required to support
Post Office Limited (ROL) in respect of criminal and/or civil litigation for the Horizon and Horizon Online
solutions. This service was introduced in response to Network Banking Requirements 260 and 315 and
this document is derived fromthe Horizon document NB/PRO/003

The defined detail of the Service is outlined in SVM/SDM/SD/0017.

This document is without prejudice to any of the parties and nothing contained herein shall be deemed or
construed as affecting contractual obligations or creating new contractual obligations between any of the
parties.

2 Scope

Audit Record Query (ARQ) requests are received, documented, interpreted and transaction data is
extracted from the Audit Archive and progressed to resolution.

Accomprehensive set of standard data information requests has been created and agreed with POL. In
the majority of cases these returns satisfy POL requests for transaction data and exceptions are dealt
with on a case by case basis. These procedures can therefore provide a flexible approach to the
provision of litigation support.

ARQ requests in support of potential litigation will be obtained solely from the Audit Archive / Server.
The method by which the integrity of this data is protected is described in the Audit Trail Functional
Specification, CRFSP6.

Requests for evidence and witness statements in support of litigation activity are received and provided.

3 Audit Record Queries (ARQs)

An AR@Q is a request to the Post Office Account (POA) for transaction data required to support a POL
investigation or litigation activity. This transaction data is held on the Audit Archive. The request is
received from the POL Casework Manager, or his nominated representative, and contains specific
search criteria. The stipulated criteria and the format of the returned data are as referenced in the
document Security Management Service - Service Description, SVM/SDM/SD/0017.

The agreed annual quotas and return timeframes for ARQ requests are as referenced in the document
Security Management Service - Service Description, SVM/SDM/SD/0017.

3.1 Format for ARQ Requests

ARQ requests in connection with litigation activity are made via an ARQ Form; the agreed detail of the
request is as referenced in the document Security Management Service - Service Description,
SVM/SDM/SD/0017.

POL will allocate a unique identifier to each request. This number will be retained by POA and will form
the basis of an audit trail for each request.

The detail of all requests will be recorded in the Litigation Support database. This database will be used

of requests issued and returned.

dealt with in accordance with Change Control Procedures.

7.2 Expert Witness Statement

Expert, in depth, analysis and detailed “expert” witness statements (as opposed to witness statements of
fact) are rarely required.

However, in the event of such a request POA will endeavour to provide “expert” witnesses who are able
to give more detailed and specific evidence to support POL’s litigation activity. This “expert” activity
shall be provided on a case by case basis and shall be dealt with in accordance with the Change Control
Procedure.
