Hi Steve
Good news, then.
Attached, please find proposed response to Dave Posnett.

I have been unable to provide status of the CP to automate the event checking process - has this been
approved/progressed? .

Please also let me know if you have any other comments and confirm when it is appropriate to send.

Kind regards
Penny

Penny,

I've checked the messagestores you provided, for the branches where I couldn't confirm by other
methods that the locking was caused by contention between the EOD process and a Riposte
checkpoint being written.

Nobody was logged on to the counters at the time the events were generated, in any of the 7
instances. So the contention was almost certainly between the two processes mentioned above,
and had no effect on any transactions or balancing carried out at the branches.

The attached spreadsheet shows the branches checked etc.

{ think this task is now complete, unless anyone knows otherwise?

Good morning,

I'm working from home today, but I did complete most of the event checks on Friday.
There are 6 or possibly 7 events which I cannot immediately rule out and so we will
need the messages for the day to see if anyone was logged on and what they were
doing (unless you still have the Riposte event/transaction logs available in which case
I'll look at them first).

This doesn't mean that the 4/5 branches are likely to have had the problem, just that I
can't rule it out yet.

It should only take about half a day to check all the message extracts, once available, so
I think actually getting the extracts is the bit that will take time now (especially as you
aren't in the office!)

There's no point progressing with the two ringers (E i think) although

my check did trap them.

Hi Anne
Hope all is well with you.

I've received an e-mail from POL on Friday chasing for status on this exercise. Can you
give me an estimate for completion?

That said, I have been unable to get into the office today because of the weather
conditions and that may also be the case for you. Forecasts are that tomorrow may be
just as bad.

Kind regards
Penny

Mik, Steve,

Most if not all of these will be caused by Riposte checkpoints failing to be written
(a benign failure), which I should be able to confirm in most cases from the SSC
event archives. This is a quick check - a few minutes per event/day. If I can't
confirm it, then Penny will have to get the messagestore back for the day or
possibly longer, and I'll have to look in more detail - but I hope there won't be
many instances for which this is necessary. I'll reassess the scale of the job once
I've done the first step.

Where the cause is the checkpoint failing to write, there are two background
processes colliding, and nothing to do with what the clerk is (or isn't) doing at the
time.

Anne,

I don't know how long each of these takes.

If you could give me some idea of the timescales, then, if necessary, I will allocate
some help for you. *

Hi Anne, hope you are well
Just following up the audit issue from a couple of weeks past.

There are 27 instants on the list, 2 of which were the original ones,
interestingly only 10 sites.

I've had a chat with Mik, to get authorisation for you to do this and he is ok,
albeit a little concerned around the amount of time it will take.

Whilst it is urgent, I appreciate that you have a tonne of other stuff to, so as
and when you can fit these in.

Would also be interested in understanding, is there a conversation that we
need to have with the PO’S?, since there are a number that have frequent
occurrences.

Thanks

Steve

I have compared your ARQs with the event data constrained as follows:

Only the specific Riposte timeout event

Events between 1st May 07 and 30th Nov 08 inclusive
Events logged between 19:00 and 19:10

Events logged by Counter 1

1 have added a worksheet into your original spreadsheet with the results -
27 matches. Can you confirm that your ringers are in there.
