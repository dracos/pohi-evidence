Combined Risk, Compliance and Audit Update

Risk

3.1

MB presented the risk report.

Focus since the last meeting had been on embedding the three lines of defence model into POL. Archer
had been populated with 453 clearly identified risks and owners (15 overarching enterprise risks, 70 linked
intermediate risks and 350 subsidiary local risks) and work has also been completed to assimilate the POL
Covid-19 risk identification and management activity into the wider enterprise risk.

a2

as

Approval has been received from GE to refresh the corporate risk appetite statements (last reviewed in
2015) and to establish a supporting set of key risk indicators using existing KPI data. A pilot is underway to
plot a set of KRIs for with Operations/Legal, IT and Finance.

The Committee noted the following key enterprise risks remain:

© Commercial —POL not an attractive business proposition due to complex/confusing products, new
products considered cost ineffective and difficult to scale.

© Covid-19 — the risk to business employees/postmasters and the business remain, particularly in
light of reduced footfall/trading on the high street.

* Financial — concern that funding is insufficient and costs uncontrolled in the short/medium/long
term leading to the inability to deliver strategic objectives.

* Legal - POL unable to comply with legislative and regulatory changes, resulting in fines, lost
revenue, reputational and customer damage. It was noted that legal and regulatory updates
would be provided to RCC to avoid this.

* Technology ~ POL is heavily reliant on key 3% IT parties that is difficult to influence and has an
ageing IT infrastructure. There is concern that the disaster recovery regime is ineffective.

* Operational — low quality branch network locations and remuneration package for agents may
impact revenue for POL and PostMasters.

Change Portfolio remains at Amber.

Compliance

34

JH presented the compliance report with the following points noted.

Telecoms: JH noted that POL continues to prioritise fault repairs for vulnerable customers and to honour
the commitments made to DCMS. Weekly updates continue to be requested by Ofcom who have now
resumed their monitoring and enforcement programme.

The Committee raised concern with POL’s inability to effectively deal with $136 and 137 information
requests, in terms of the accuracy of information provided to the regulator and the reliance on 3 party
providers for information without carrying out sufficient checks.

The Chair requested that a comprehensive response programme be developed to reduce the possibility of
being penalised.

To do:
TL/BF/JH

35

Fairness: JH reported (Ofcom) would be reporting on fairness in early 2021 and that POL is considered (by
the regulator) to have a high number of customers considered ‘vulnerable’ i.e. those who have been paying
higher prices than customers in contract for more than 2-3 years.

The Telco team was asked to consider ways to reduce the number of ‘vulnerable customers’ and to revert
to the Committee with a statement/plan for November.

Action
Ms

GLO/Freedom of Information Requests: JH remarked resource has been stretched responding to Historic
Shortfall Scheme, related/linked FOI requests (55 as at 24.06.2020) and CCRC requests. The

Tab 2 Previous Meetings

sensitivity/complex nature of the FOI requests has required external legal support, as well as approval from
the GLO Steerco and notification to UKGI before release.

3.5 Belfast Data Centre Exist and move to the Cloud: JH noted that data migration from the Belfast Data Centre
is planned for eight weeks’ time, and that an approach has been agreed between IT, Legal and Compliance.

This approach enables POL to deploy a contractual and operational solution that eradicates the need for
approval from upstream clients where personal data may be processed outside of the EEA. A compliant
solution inside POL’s Risk Appetite has been identified and is under development.

JS noted that the talks with upstream clients and the short time from for data migration would be
challenging.

3.6 I Cookies: JH advised a solution has been built and deployed to meet the Directive 2009/136/EC, (known as
the Cookie Law), however the solution does not fully satisfy all regulator (ICO) consents.

The Data Protection and legal teams are reviewing the implications to POL following a recent case in
Germany where a company used a similar solution to POL's but was deemed to be non-compliant with EU
legislation.

3.7. I Financial Crime: there has been a large increase in suspicious activities reports during lockdown, with 930
SARs and 159 investigations in April & May (cf 598 and 84 in April & May 2019). The team is working closely
with the banks to understand the reasons for the spike.

Internal Audit

3.8 I JApresented the IA report. To do: JA

‘A summary of findings from last year’s IA programme (2019/20) noted 171 audit actions across 25 audits
in total (cf 271 actions across 24 audits in 2018/19). JA advised the lower number of actions could be
attributed to a general improvement in the control environment.

Some improvements are required in core controls following system and organisational changes during the
year, risk management and governance oversight has slightly decreased, but information, communication
and report turnaround has improved.

JAwas asked to consider ways of improving core controls.
3.9 I The Committee noted the following audits have been completed since the last ARC meeting (6/5/20):

FS Branch Sales (FY20 1A Plan) (Final Report)

CV-19 Programme Assurance - Phi Set-up & Governance

Minimum Control Standards — Phi Cash Controls

Minimum Control Standards ~ Ph2 Minimum Control Standards ~ Ph2
Cyber Security Maturity Assessment

¢ — Effectiveness of Second Line during CV-19 - Ph1.

The combined Risk, Compliance and Audit paper was NOTED for onward submission to the ARC.
4. _I PCI-DSS and Cyber Security Update

PCI-DSS Programme Update

4.1 I JS presented the PCI-DSS update.

He reported further funding has been agreed by the Board (26 May 2020 Board meeting) to progress the
programme until completion, and that NR and JS had met with Paula Felstead, Ingenico Group CTO.
Ingenico had provided a renewed commitment to achieve Vocalink Accreditation by the end of December
2020.

The Banking forum has also been updated with a plan/timetable of key dates for 2021, indicating Pilot and
Branch rollout commencing in February 2021. He expects formal PCI DSS accreditation to be achieved by
June 2021.

4.2_I The following PCI key risks were discussed:

POL00401629

* Any additional essential changes required to the Fujitsu /Ingenico software would impact the
planned timeline. Fujitsu and Ingenico have given a commitment to meeting the current
timescales on the basis there are no further changes.

* Concern that POCa payments cannot be routed through Vocalink within the timescales. The team
is working to identify a solution.

* Concern that Santander cannot migrate payments to route through Vocalink within the timescales.
The team is working closely with Santander.

43 I The Chair noted the progress made, but requested the report should clearly identify what progress has
been made, the areas completed, those on track or not, and those that remain outstanding. Technical
jargon should be avoided.

‘The PCI-DSS Programme Update was NOTED for onward submission to the ARC.
Cyber Security

44 I TJ presented the Cyber Security update.

Cyber Security Maturity: good progress has been made with the Deloitte cyber security maturity
assessment and a report from Deloitte is expected in July detailing detailed actions for further mature Cyber
controls. In the interim, Internal Audit has worked with Deloitte to provide an overarching report giving
key recommendations and maturity assessments.

Compared to last year, TI believes maturity is more secure, and that focus should be on developing a cyber
security strategy as the business and IT strategies unfold.

45 I Covid-19: TJ noted that during the pandemic, phishing traffic had increased but that SPAM-based mail
attacks now appear to have returned to normal levels. The team has completed a targeted phishing
simulation to raise awareness within POL.

Joiners Movers Leavers (JML)

4.6 I TJ presented the JML report.

JML remains a key focus for the team. A draft reference model has been developed identifying the role
and accountability of each department in the JML process, helping to reduce single points of failure.

Good progress has been made enhancing the integrity of the links between Success Factors, Microsoft
Identity Manager and Active Directory which controls access administration and the project is expected to
be completed in August 2020.

4.7 I Regarding third party access to JMIL, although the team conducts audits, POL remains reliant upon suppliers
being honest. A move toa cloud (such as Belfast Exit project) presents an opportunity for greater oversight
and control.

48 I The Chair noted the progress made, but remarked ARC would question why the project had not been
completed, as well as the lack of control over 3" party access.

The Cyber Security Update and JML report was NOTED for onward submission to the ARC.

5. _ I Business Continuity Update and Business Continuity Policy

5.1 I TApresented the Business Continuity update.

‘A complete failure of Horizon (no strategy has been developed for large scale failure) remains POL’s key
risk, but the current approach to resilience remains effective.

5.2. I Covidi9 has demonstrated that POL can run effectively via home working for an unlimited period of time,
and the ability to maintain call centres with home working including supporting a third party POCA call
centre, means a solution is now being considered and explored. The ‘Post Office on Wheels’ (deployed for
contingency purposes) has proved effective during the pandemic, however plans should be developed to
mitigate against a second Covid wave.

Business Continuity Policy

5.3 I TA advised there have been no material changes to the policy since last year and that it remains suitable
for purpose.

5.4 I The Business Continuity update and Policy were NOTED for onward submission to the ARC.

6.__I GDPR Update

6.1 _I JH presented the GDPR update.

Tab 2 Previous Meetings

The team has now completed a review of contracts not previously remediated or de-scoped during the
original GDPR remediation programme, identifying 7 key contracts as high risk including:

+ cwu

. Unite

+ Fujitsu Telecoms

+ Global Payments

* OHAssist
+ RAPP
+ Selenity.

6.2 I Work is underway to support the contract owners, however the Committee remains concerned that other
high risk contracts may be identified following programme completion.

‘The GDPR Update paper was NOTED for onward submission to the ARC.
._ I Suspense Accounts
7.1 I BF and TP presented the Suspense Accounts report.

BF explained that KPMG had been commissioned to review whether POL has profited from money held in
suspense accounts, following longstanding allegations pre and post GLO.
7.2 I Areview of current practices has now been completed and identified four suspense accounts currently in
operation. These suspense accounts contain money that is:

(1) Either not taken to a profit and loss account; or

(2) Relates to unmatched transactions due to customers (not Postmasters); or

(3)_Relates to surpluses rather than shortfalls.
7.3. I TP remarked that no money has been identified as being taken for profit, and that the team would be I Action:

did not cover the historical operation of the suspense accounts, which the Chair requested be investigated.

EN ‘An internal audit has also been commissioned to

understand why this has not been previously identified, and to ensure that any lessons are learnt.

8.3 I BF highlighted to the Committee that the POL’s directors may wish to make a report to the regulator, and
that they would be entitled to obtain their own independent legal advice which could be arranged through

the legal team.

The Committee discussed and recognised the potential for future litigation and regulatory fines (which
should not be underestimated), and noted that the legal advice received had strongly indicated that no
report should be made at this stage, until the scale of issue was known.

MC was reminded that the potential for litigation should not be underestimated.
8.4 _I The paper was NOTED for onward submission to the ARC.
9. __ I Law and Trends Update
9.1 _I SIG presented the Law and Trends update paper.
9.2 I She explained the purpose of the paper was to highlight any future legislation and or regulation that may
impact POL, bringing the following to the Committee’s attention:
*  Covid 19 Employment Legislation Updates.
* ATM Additional Business Rates Update.
* Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No.2) Accessibility Regulations.

POL00401629
POL00401629

9.3 I Covid-19 Employment Legislation Updates: there has been a recent flurry of legislative changes to
react/mitigate against Covid-19. The Coronavirus Act 2020 (effective 25 March 2020) introduces
emergency powers to handle the COVID-19 pandemic. Working groups continue to review and monitor
guidance to ensure POL is compliant.

9.4 I ATM Additional Business Rates Update: a recent UK Supreme Court case has ruled that ATM facilities do
not need to be assessed separately for business rates. POL has approximately 53 ATMS where claims can
be made via an online system, however, only the occupier of the site can make the claim. In this instance,
801 would have to make the claim for POL backdated to 31 March 2018.

9.5 I Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No.2) Accessibility Regulations: public sector
websites have a legal duty to make sure their websites meet accessibility requirements by 23 September
2020. Mobile apps are expected to be compliant by 23 June 2021. The digital innovation team believed
POL’s website was compliant and work was ongoing to meet the mobile applications compliance by the
June 2021 deadline.

9.6 _I The paper was NOTED for onward submission to the ARC.

10. I Policies for Approval:

The following policies were NOTED for onward submission to the ARC:

* Modern Slavery Statement: AK provided a more robust training regime had been implemented
and that there was a greater understanding in the network about slavery/exploitation. JT
highlighted the positive impact the branch support guide had provided to branches to highlight
any issues of modern slavery and where to report these.

© Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy

*  Whistleblowing Policy

* Financial Crime Policy

* Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Terrorist Financing Policy

* Document Retention Policy

* Procurement Policy.

gy Central Risk Review

Central Risk seeing increasing levels of engagement from individual business units in managing
the risks for which they are accountable (in their 1* line role).
Some areas of relative weakness that are being addressed include;

+ Risk articulation: ongoing need to be clear on the cause, event and impact of the risk

+ Alignment: Ensuring risks articulated elsewhere (such as in ARC and Board papers) are
reflected and managed through RSA Archer

+ Mitigations: sometimes need strengthening i.e. no mitigations at all, or not SMART (what, by
who, by when)

+ RAG ratings: need to ensure in some instances that risks have been rated in line with
corporate standards

Summary

The Post Office has 15 active enterprise which provide the overall, thematic framework within
which linked subsidiary intermediate and local risks sit.

Given their strategic nature enterprise risks do not see significant change in ratings month on
month albeit 7 of these (i.e. Operational and Change) has seen a slight increase over the period.
This is in part because Central Risk are providing increasing challenge around understanding
how movement and churn at the lower levels have a material impact at the enterprise level

Central Risk have commenced work in the period of ensuring that enterprise risk mitigation
activity is shaped by the work and priorities of the linked intermediate and local risk rather than
seen as standalone.

Legal, Operational and IT target ratings will be shaped followed by the planned approval of
updated risk appetite statements and Key Risk Indicators expected imminently.

Summary

The Post Office has 72 intermediate risks of which 4 are rated as Critical, 24 Very High and 42
high.

42% of these risks has seen an increase in their current risk rating in the last reporting period
with 31% remaining unchanged. This level of relative volatility is primarily the result of
increasing Central Risk scrutiny and challenge along with the business re-articulating and
refocusing some risks as accountability becomes clearer.

15 intermediate risks have been categorised as Commercial. These include risks associated with
Banking Services dependency, existing product simplicity and the relevance of new products. 8
intermediate risks are Operational which including risks around the fragility of multiple partners,
postmaster remuneration and maintenance of Network numbers.

Key risks include;

+ Government Services: Risk the Post Office's revenue from the provision of Government
Services (i.e. Digital Check & Send, IDPs) may reduce over the short-, medium- and long-
term.

+ Digital Income: Risk the on-line products and services generate a reduced income level

+ Telco Dependency: Risk Post Office has limited influence on Fujitsu's T&C's (or ability to exit )
therefore undermining performance and change affordability.

+ Customer Demand: Risk existing and emerging requirements of Post Office (new and
existing) customers across the various sectors are not met such that customer demand
declines rapidly in a 3-10 year timescale and the Post Office is unable to change cost base

Summary

The Post Office has undertaken significant work in recent months to ensure all local risks are
uploaded onto the GRC tool and linked directly to higher level enterprise and intermediate risk
levels to provide an overall, risk profile across specific themes.

This work is ongoing but current data shows (as at end of 8/2020) we have 386 open Local
Level risks. This is a -10 net reduction since 7/2020 (10 new risks raised and 20 closed in
monthly reporting period). The bulk of these low level risks have been categorised as
Commercial (64), Operational (55) and Legal (70). The latter cover risks around potential non-
compliance across various regulations (AML, ABC, vehicle safety, environment etc). There has
also been (28) IT local risks articulated around specific IT components reaching ‘end of life’. IT
have an emerging risk: Fujitsu datacentre failed over the Bank Holiday weekend, the complete
environment was failed over and brought up on DR and restored again onto production with only
minimal interruption to BAU, so there's confidence now on the shutdown / restore activities.

Central Risk are proactively liaising with Business Risk Leads to ensure local risks are correctly
articulated, rated and categorised, This may see some movement in numbers and the shape of
the profile at this local level in coming weeks. Target ratings in many cases await the outcome
of the risk appetite and KRI work.

Key Risks

There are 3 Local Level risks whose current rating is Critical (20) namely
+ Industrial Action: Risk the Post Office Commercial proposition is unattractive because existing
products are too complex or confusing, new product are cost ineffective, unattractive to the

market and/or unable to be scaled.
Key mitigation include refreshed IR Framework, direct comms to Field teams and employees,
and regular review of IA contingency plans
+ Health & Safety: Risk Post Office business employees and postmasters are adversely
impacted by the spread of the COVID-19 virus and wider associated socio-economic activity.
Ongoing mitigation include provision of PPE equipment, maintenance and monitoring of
Government guidelines of maintaining safe distance between customers/staff and monitor
existing workplace H&S hygiene measures
: Risk there is insufficient change funding available
to deliver planned change activity. Key mitigations include re-prioritisation of the change
portfolio (and a recalibration following the launch of a refreshed Strategy) and discussion with
UKGI re LT funding as part of the Government's comprehensive spending review.

Executive Summary

Background

In 6/2020 GE commissioned Central Risk to update the Post Office’s corporate risk appetite statements, develop
supporting Key Risk Indicators (KRIs) and pilot the approach in Operational, Technology & Security and Legal
Compliance & Governance (LCG).

Central Risk have focused initially on LCG through a desk-based risk review, the completion of a simple
questionnaire and a series of detailed 121 meetings. We have pulled together a suite of draft LCG appetite
statements, supporting KRI’s and indicative thresholds. These are still in draft as they will still be subject to GE,
Board, ARC approval. They have been included in this pack to give an illustration of our emerging approach and how
the individual GE member, supported by their Risk Lead and Central Risk, can use it to regular monitor performance
against their risk appetite and keep within approved tolerances.

Illustrative Findings

Central Risk’s findings are that LCG has 1 enterprise and 7 linked intermediate risks split into 5 groups. Each group
has a defined risk appetite (which applies to all the risks within that group) and a range of supporting associated
KRIs. The groupings and indicative appetites are

A supporting Dashboard is being developed which links the (then) current ratings of individual risks, the KRI trends
and how these relate to the associated risk appetite. This consolidated analysis will inform the action (if any) that
should be taken in the next reporting period to manage the risks.

Tolerance for uncertainty: How willing is the Post Office to accept uncertain outcomes? This illustrates the Board's appetite to trade off certainty to achieve a given
objective. A low rating demonstrates the Board's need for certain outcomes, while a high rating shows the Board will pursue an objective even with an uncertain outcome.

? Decision choice: When faced with multiple decision options, how is the Post Office willing to select a decision that puts a strategic objective at risk? This question
assesses the Board’s acceptance that a given choice may lead to failure to meet a strategic objective. A Board who are averse will only choose options that pose a minimal
threat to the strategic objective’s achievement. A Board open to this risk are willing to trade off the possibility of failure for a high-risk, high-reward decision.

: Prioritisation of strategic objective: How willing is the Post Office willing to trade off this specific objective against achievement of other objectives? This demonstrates
the Board’s willingness to pursue achievement of a given strategic objective over achievement of another. A Board who are averse to this would never trade off completing
the objective in question for failure of other objectives. A Board which is open would be willing to accept this trade-off.

Telecoms Providers’ response to Coronavirus

1 Given our strong call centre performance during the pandemic and that Ofcom have
resumed normal duties, Ofcom has agreed to our request to stop the fortnightly reporting.
We have agreed with Ofcom to extend our commitments in line with the major operators
and have also agreed with the NHS that we will run our offer until September. DCMS has
also reached out to us and asked us to commit to not having any broadband usage caps.

Fairness

2 In early August, Ofcom wrote to Nick Read requesting a meeting in September/October
to discuss Post Office performance against the Fairness Commitments. Ahead of this
meeting it has asked Post Office to supply information on the progress we have made
since signing up to the commitments, as well information on our plans for the year ahead.
Work is underway preparing the response.

3. At our last meeting with Ofcom it said that it considers customers as “vulnerable” when
they have been out of contract for a long time e.g., 2-3 years. Ofcom thought Post Office
would be near the top of providers with a high percentage of out of contract customers
(paying higher prices than in contract customers) and wanted to see progress on this. The
introduction of Annual Best Tariffs will go some way to address this (see below). However,
given timings of the RFP and budget constraints Post Office has not been able to go beyond
the regulation.

Annual Best Tariff Notifications

4 Following on from the introduction of End of Contract Notifications, Post Office is required
to send Annual Best Tariff Notifications (ABT) to customers who have been out of contract
for more than a year and not received an End of Contract Notification. The ABT must be

centre and drive complaints as people will query why their current price is higher than the
new offers in their communications.

Voice only customers

5 The Telecoms Team is reviewing the impact of Project Galaxy on its customers. Galaxy
was Post Office’s response to Ofcom's 2017 intervention in the voice only market, which
saw BT reach a voluntary commitment with Ofcom to reduce its pricing by £5. Ofcom has
been requesting information to help it understand the impact the voluntary price cap has
had on the market and customer engagement. It is not clear at this stage what action
they will take.

6 Through Galaxy, customers who had a vulnerability flag on their account were
automatically moved to the cheaper voice only plan but could take the combined
broadband and voice offer. All other customers were automatically opted into the
combined broadband and voice plan but could opt out and take the cheaper voice only
plan. Not all customers that were opted into the combined plan requested the router,
which is necessary for them to take advantage of Post Office broadband. Compliance has
recommended that action needs to be taken with these customers.

7 The Telecoms Team is reviewing its options and as a first initiative is planning on issuing
a reminder to customers on their bills to request a router, which can be done relatively
quickly.

10 The new European Electronic Communications Code (EECC) will impose new regulatory
obligations on all providers. These obligations will include changes to the switching
process, additional information about contracts, provision of pre-contract information and
accessibility obligations.

GLO and Historic Shortfall Scheme

12 Compliance has been working with the GLO project to identify, locate and provide all data
required to support the various ongoing initiatives, in particular;

« — Working with the Historic Shortfall Scheme to manage and answer all requests for
information and data to support applications, this work is complex and likely to run
into Q4. As at 26'" August 2020, there are currently 174 live requests, this number
may rise as a result of the upcoming Stamps scheme.

«Provide information to support those cases that have been referred by the CCRC.
These searches are complex, and Compliance is working with external law firms to
identify, locate and extrapolate all information that may be required by the Court

13 In addition, there has been a significant rise in complex Freedom of Information
Requests relating to GLO matters which are being managed with support from external
Counsel.

14 We have received 40 FOI requests from one individual that has been actively blogging and
reporting throughout the GLO process. Working with external Counsel these requests will
be rejected on the grounds that they are Vexatious (Section 14 FOI Act).

15 In response to specific requests for information the team have identified 31k boxes of files
currently with Oasis contain hardcopy documents returned by branches that are
closed. We do not know exactly what documents are inside these boxes as there are no
external indexing outside the boxes.

16 They are likely to contain branch balancing data, trading statements, daily and weekly
reports. They may also contain HR files such as P250 assistant verification and contractual
information on the agent/postmaster

significance of this information on the CCRC and HSS projects. set

Implications of Schrems II case and Privacy Shield:

22 Acase was brought before the CJEU challenging the use of Privacy Shield for International
Transfers of Personal Data from the EU to the US.

23 The CJEU recently found in favour of Schrems stating that organisations could no longer
rely on the use of Privacy Shield to legitimise transfers to the US. The exposure to Post
Office to this part of the ruling is minimal and will cause no significant issues.

24 The CJEU went further in its findings casting doubt over the validity and use of Standard
Contractual Clauses (SCCs) to legitimise transfers not only to the US but to anywhere
outside of the EU.

25 The European Data Protection Board will be producing new SCCs considering this ruling.
If Schremsis successful in his challenge to the SCCs, or significant
changes are introduced, then this will have a significant impact on Post Office contracts
where personal data is stored outside of the EEA.

26 The extent of Post Office exposure is being considered with a report being produced for
future RCC meetings.

GDPR Contract Remediation;

27 The Contract Remediation project was formally closed at the end of July as reported to
the previous RCC. Work is ongoing on the 8 outstanding contracts which, due to their
complexity, are likely to continue for some time.

28 Monthly CRG meetings continue to monitor progress and support negotiations. This will
continue until all outstanding contracts are finalised.

Compliance with Money Laundering Regulations

29 Between 20" June and 19" August, 153 Bureau de Change cases were identified, up 53%
on the same period 2019. There has been an increase in branches splitting transactions
and customers visiting multiple locations, although some of these are genuine and linked
to low stock levels in branch in June/July. Some branches have split transactions to
amounts under the ID threshold following the initial amount failing eKYC. These have
been escalated to the relevant area and contract managers to remedy.

30 The data fix for Sanction screening has been implemented and two potential Sanction
declines were reported in early August, although on review, neither were exact matches.
The customer data for these transactions was present in AML Credence. However, not all
transaction information flowed through. This has been escalated to DCoE, which is
investigating with Accenture.

2019). SARs for July 2020 reached the highest level seen since 2015, when records
started. Of those received from the Network and CViT, the majority relate to MoneyGram

32 Due to increased workloads, approval has been obtained for an additional Fixed Term
Contract PO grade in Chesterfield until the end of March 2021. If volumes continue at
current levels, this will need to be a permanent role for 2021/22.

33 Post Office has been advised that we have been assigned a new HMRC regulatory
supervisor, as the individual who took over when Lee Simpson retired in May has moved
to a new role. An introductory meeting is scheduled for 30'* September.

34 A further meeting was held with HMRC on the forthcoming fees consultation. It has
considered the options and points we have previously raised and advised that some
suggestions relating to turnover and tiered approaches will be in the fee consultation.
There are currently no agreed timescales for when this will be published.

35 In response to the 2019 Government’s Economic Crime plan, HMT has published a
consultation on an Economic Crime Levy, which it plans to introduce for the AML-regulated
sector to fund measures to combat economic crime and money laundering. The
consultation is currently being reviewed by Legal and Compliance and responses are
required by 13'" October 2020. There is a risk that this could increase Post Office costs
by over £1m per annum.

36 Financial crime risk assessments have been hampered by lack of engagement by some
product managers. Compliance re-scheduled assessments to support business critical
priorities during the Covid lockdown, but recently the MLRO has had to send chasers via
some Product Directors.

37 To address these issues, activity is planned during Q3 to raise awareness with Commercial
teams about their responsibilities under Post Office policies and the importance and
benefits of these risk assessments. Updated content is planned for the Financial Crime
intranet page to aid Product Information Pack and post-assessment action plan
completion.

38 Compliance approved a trial to remove in-branch ID verification for online Drop & Go
applications at the start of Covid. The product team also included in-branch applications,
although this was not part of the proposal approved by Compliance. Data has been
reviewed and shows that the pilot has been commercially successful, and there have been
no issues to date. We have approved this as a permanent change, subject to the risks
being called out on the Commercial team’s RACM and that action is taken to address and
remove duplicate accounts.

Anti-Bribery and Corruption (“ABC”) update

39 The IT issues relating to the new gifts and hospitality tool have now been resolved.
Reporting has remained low during lockdown.

40 Annual ABC training is due to be launched 5 September, and a number of
communications and reminders are planned during August and September.

Whistleblowing Update

compared to 4 in the same period last year. Most relate to reports from agent assistants
about activity in branches.

42 The two cases which were previously on hold due to Covid-19 are now being investigated
by Area Managers and should be concluded in September. There have been no other
impacts caused by Covid-19 or working from home, and there have been no changes to 3
the report types and categories received.

Fit & Proper update

43 The agent F&P data solution went live in July, and the first cohort of 500 agents was put
through the re-declaration process, with all agents responding by the due date. The
second cohort commenced 17" August and includes all Commercial Partners.

44 Circa 1K temporarily ‘paused’ branches have been re-instated, and HMRC has agreed that
the premises fees for these will be deferred to 1% December in line with our annual
registration fees.

45 The monthly agent data for July was c.1 week late due to issues manually appending
agent data as the change request to annotate the ‘paused’ branches in the new system
has not yet been delivered. HMRC were contacted and approved the delay. The next
monthly data is due 28" August and will be delivered on time.

46 A previously identified issue relating to registration and missing agent data for branches
in a ‘Short Term Temporary Closed’ status for extended periods (in some cases over 18
months) is being investigated by the Network Development Team to ensure that a policy
and process is in place to manage branches in this status and where there is no longer a
postmaster contracted to run the branch.

47 Anew flag has been added as a mandatory field in Success Factors for all job requisition
approvals which will drive weekly reporting to ensure that all employees in relevant Post
Office roles undertake the HMRC F&P test, and that when individuals move to different
roles/leave Post Office, they are removed from the HMRC register.

External Threats

48 We continue to support the Covid Fusion Cell, and the sub-group looking at cash-based
money laundering. Criminals continue to exploit COVID-19 and concerns remain about
the effect that the downturn on the economy will have on the recruitment of mules to
launder the proceeds of crime. Compliance has continued to deliver branch
communications on scams and COVID-19 related fraud.

49 There continues to be concern about high value banking cash deposits relating to Money
Service Businesses in East London, and liaison with the National Economic Crime Agency
is ongoing. We are working with the Supply Chain, Network, Security and Banking teams
to address the AML and people safety risks. A workshop to find solutions that remediate
these risks is being held w/c 7" September. In order to continue to accept these deposits
it is essential that these risks are addressed.

50 We have been advised by an HMRC investigator that information we provided concerning
high value cash deposits being made early on in the Covid lockdown at a branch in
Manchester, has led to a £78K seizure and multiple arrests.

Supply Chain Compliance

51 The Health & Safety team approved travel and on-site compliance assurance work from
July - a risk assessment is completed ahead of all compliance assurance activity. 3
compliance assurance visits have been completed including Note Circulation Scheme
(Bank of England) at Midway House and Bristol & Swansea ahead of the external audit
scheduled for September.

52 Additionally, a trial remote compliance assurance of the licence management team was

completed - learnings from this will be used to enhance future assurance activity and
reduce time spent on site.

Compliance Monitoring

56 Compliance is currently supporting the business with support and communications on
preparing for business re-invigoration in the post lockdown environment.

57 The key resumption of activity will be Travel Insurance (TI) sold in branch on September
14th. The branch-based policy has not been sold since March and it is significantly different
from that previous version sold with 3 layers of cover and new Covid 19 conditions that
will need to be disclosed clearly at point of sale.

58 The interim training solution produced by POI (Microsoft Sway) relies on Postmasters using
personal devices to access an online training and test. Compliance has supported the
training solution provided that
e¢ It is clear that only the individual that has taken and passed the training is the
individual that gets given access to TI sales on Horizon. This is consistent with our
Smart ID Principles for regulated sales including mails, savings, telecoms and other
insurance sales.

59 From August a small number of mystery shops for POI protection business has resumed,
a wider mystery shopping (Bol, Telecoms, Insurance) will resume in Q3, including for the
re-launched travel insurance business.

their branch Network or close ATMs had to report their plans to them including how they
will ensure access to cash is maintained. This demonstrates the regulatory concern related
to ‘access to cash’ and the cost pressures Banks are under to try and slim down their

programme is in fact two mutually dependent sets of activities with
some conflicting priorities - the fast migration and decommission of
applications and data; and the setup of a Post Office Cloud Centre of

RRC REPORT

Title: PCI DSS Compliance Meeting Date: I 10'* September 2020

Joseph Moussalli, PCI DSS Jeff Smyth, Interim Group
Programme Manager Chief Information Officer

Author:

Sponsor:

Input Sought: For Noting

RRC is requested to note:
What programme progress has been made during the last reporting period?
What are the key risks?

Previous Governance Oversight
ARC has requested a rolling update on PCI-DSS programme progress.

Executive Summary
The programme consists of 2 core delivery streams:

1. The Point-to-Point Encryption (P2PE) workstream, which encrypts retail and banking
transactions from the Pin Entry Device (PED) to a PCI compliant zone in Ingenico before
onward processing to Global Payments (retail transactions) or VocaLink (banking
transactions).

2. The Target Operating Model (TOM) workstream which addresses use of PCI data by POL
in processes outside of the transactions occurring at the PED.

The P2PE workstream is on track to deliver per plan the Vocalink accreditation of the retail &
banking software. This activity is followed by a final round of testing and branch piloting activity
which is on track to complete by March 2021. After the pilot activity is completed, the solution
will be progressively rolled out across all branches with a full rollout and formal independent
QSA accreditation being completed by June 2021. The team is continuing to investigate options
to improve the velocity of the roll-out phase timelines.

The TOM workstream has identified seven areas where changes to products and processes are
required to achieve PCI compliance. The activity required to address each of these areas has
been planned and we are working with suppliers to achieve the required remediation.

Key updates in the last period:

e Fujitsu and Ingenico completed the 2" banking key milestone, a balance enquiry, and
the banking solution is on track to complete to plan.

e Delivery of the payment solution has slipped 3 weeks due to issues with the Global
Payments test environment. Accreditation of the retail payment solution is now
scheduled to complete in October (versus September). As this is not on the critical
path there is no impact to the end to end plan.

e Additional changes have been identified and the project team is working with the
business to understand criticality and potential workarounds. Fujitsu and Ingenico are
also impact assessing the changes in order that these can be delivered in future
releases of the software.

Report
1. What has been the progress since the programme last presented in May 2020?

IT workstream

e The Fujitsu / Ingencio software development is tracking to our overall IT workstream
plan and CWO.

e Payments Release - there are two interim milestone delays that are being managed.

o Payments release accreditation - Ingenico has started Global Payments
accreditation and it was due for completion in 20‘ August 2020. It is now due
for completion on 18'" September 2020 with the certificate to follow in October.

o The Fujitsu Payments release is tracking 3 weeks late on the contracted interim
milestone 23 October 2020 due to the complexity of the solution and key
Fujitsu staff being affected by Covid-19. This is now due to complete on 16"
November 2020. Neither of these changes affects the overall delivery critical
path.

« Banking Release- Ingenico have delivered the 1° key milestone and 2" key milestone in
July (a demo of a Balance Enquiry). This milestone validates a significant proportion of
the messaging protocols, transaction logic and connectivity paths between Ingenico and
Vocalink.

e The upgrade of the Pin Entry Device (PED) to branches restarted on 1% July and we have
now completed 95% of the branch upgrades (22,296 of 23,483 PEDs). This work is now
due to complete in September 2020 with no impact to the critical path.

e POca - JPMorgan have started the design work to migrate to the banking framework.

e Good progress has been made with the Service contract with no major issues
outstanding. This is activity is on track to work through formal governance and sign off
is expected in September 2020.

e A standing executive meeting now occurs every 6 weeks with Executives from both POL
(Nick Read & Jeff Smyth) and Ingenico (Dan Martensson, VP Global Enterprise Sales &
Regional Marketing, and Paula Felstead, Global CTO). Ingenico continue to provide
commitment to achieve full accreditation with Vocalink by the end of December 2020

Target Operating Model (TOM) Workstream Update

The focus of the Target Operating Model workstream is to review the Products and
Processes that use Card Holder Data and to remediate and remove them from the scope
of the PCI DSS audit where possible. If removal is not possible then PCI DSS controls will
be put in place. A plan has been prepared to remediate the products and processes.

« The TOM workstream is progressing to plan. A dashboard illustrating the status of
the seven releases can be found in the Appendix 2. Key achievements this period are
listed below:

e High Level Solution Design HLD v2.4 has been approved by EAG. It includes
solutions Card Data Handing Environment (CDHE), Office 365 and Mimecast
functionality received EAG approval, TES, PODG.

e Release A: Obfuscation of PCI data on screens and receipts. The solution for this has
been developed been deployed.

« Release B: Telephone payments. The build has been completed ahead of schedule
and the system is being tested.

« Release F (Quatrix): 14-day retention policy implemented on Quatrix. First Quatrix
scan completed (14/08). Results currently being reviewed. Mimecast (risk raised last
month) a way forward has been agreed on how to implement alerting rules.

« Release G: PCI DSS compliant solution agreed with EAG for providing full PAN for the
Financial Crime and Banking enquiries team.

« Success Factors: Support and Support Plus training modules were released onto
Success Factors for Information Security and Data Protection to incorporate PCI DSS
training requirements.

e Change Giving: Change giving has been confirmed as out of scope as Change Giving
cards are not on card schemes.

e HLSD: HLD v2.4 including Card Data Handing Environment (CDHE), Office 365 and
Mimecast functionality received EAG approval (13/08)

2. What are the key risks on the programme?
The following are identified as key risks:

Risk: There is a risk that any changes needed to the Fujitsu/Ingenico software will impact
the plan. Fujitsu and Ingenico have given a commitment to meeting the current timescales
on the basis of no further changes.

Mitigation: Post Office continue to review design documentation and interim software
releases to validate requirements traceability. A number of items have been identified and
these are currently under review and under impact assessment with the suppliers. Where
new requirements are identified an impact assessment will be completed to include any
impact to time and cost. We are also seeking to manage business processes ie.e adjust
operational processes to avoid any further critical path software development where
applicable.

Risk: There is a risk that due to the complexity of the solution further funds may be
needed. Fujitsu are forecasting an overspend of 10% - £504k.

Mitigation: Post Office are reviewing (and challenging) the forecast with Fujitsu and will
continue to track and manage this risk with Fujitsu.

Risk: There is a risk that Santander cannot migrate services to route through Vocalink
within the timescales.

Mitigation: Post Office team is working closely with Santander to produce proposals
including costs and timescales. However, Santander have failed to provide a technical
resource to scope out their changes. This has been escalated to the Director of Banking
Services. A contingency technical arrangement is also being investigated.

Risk: There is a risk that Coronavirus may impact the delivery timescales for any supplier
across the entire PCI programme. The outbreak of Coronavirus is a global risk event and
the overall impact for the programme is not fully evaluated. Consequently, there may be
a delay to the some or all of the agreed deliverables which could affect the build or
deployment programme stages. Our risk assessment activity has been expanded to
include the potential impact of any remediation work that has a high dependency on Indian
offshore resources and in parallel, evaluation of how any second spikes could influence
our delivery or implementation timetable.

Mitigation: Post Office is working with all engaged suppliers to better understand their
contingency plans to ensure that delivery momentum is maintained. This includes the
examination of options to minimise delivery impact by understanding key delivery person
risks, supply chain risks and other indirect or latent dependency factors.

Executive Summary

The COVID-19 period has required us to keep a close watch on cyber issues. As we enter the
period beyond the initial COVID19 lockdown the cyber threat is changing and therefore
continues to be a major focus for the IT team. This paper describes:

- How we plan to increase the maturity of our cyber capability in response to future
threats and the emerging business and IT strategies;

- How effective we are at detecting and stopping current threats by understanding
(through a dashboard) the nature of the threats we face and the value delivered by
our SOC through a recent exercise;

- How we are dealing with the rising and changing threat from Ransomware.

Questions addressed

1. How are we planning to increase the maturity of our cyber capability?
2. How are we detecting and stopping current threats?
3. How have we focusing on and dealing with Ransomware-related threats?

Report _- How are we planning to increase the maturity of our cyber

capability in 2020/1

4. At the last meeting we presented the results of the Deloitte maturity re-assessment which
showed
a. We had made significant improvements in most areas;
b. That there are additional maturity improvement activities that we need to take
to meet our agreed target maturity in 17 areas.

This assessment considered our stated crown jewel systems and the external and internal
cyber threats against them.

5. Since then the POL business and IT strategies have been developing at pace. These
contain major strategic initiatives requiring enhanced Cyber attention, namely:

a. End User Computing (EUC) delivering key cyber capabilities out of the box
into our back-office environment;

b. Belfast Exit, requiring the development of cyber capability into the Amazon
Web Services cloud;

c. Strategic Platform Modernisation (SPM) developing the next generation
retail systems for POL all requiring security input

d. Joiners, Movers, Leavers (JML) - securing the digital identity and access
rights of POL staff

e. IT Controls - increasing the coverage, effectiveness, and ownerships of
controls across IT in Post Office Group and its third parties

f. Development of a GLO IT forensics team within Cyber/IT

6. Item d is the subject of a separate paper from the CISO. Items e and f are being led by
the CISO initially whilst permanent resources are recruited and will be reported elsewhere.
Items a to c are covered in the programme for Cyber Maturity in 2020/1.

7. In common with many businesses POL is under significant cost pressure. Taking all of the
above into account we have therefore adopted the following principles for our 2020/1
cyber programme:

a. Deliver maturity increases where there is greatest value for lowest cost - this
will include Cyber Strategy and Policy developments plus other areas where we
are making process-related changes.

b. Align as much as possible of the major cost items with delivery from other IT
projects such as EUC, Belfast Exit where we will gain the capability as part of
these projects.

c. Defer the remainder of the higher cost items for maturity increase.

d. Focus on security activities to enable the business such as those around SPM
and Belfast Exit.

8. Our 2020/1 cyber programme therefore consists of

a. Cyber Capability maturity enhancements
i. Deployment of Vulnerability Management automation within the SOC
using Archer
Integration of SOC and IT Service ticketing through Service Now
. Enhancements to SOC automation platform
iv. Other Deloitte maturity review remediations
v. Red team remediation activity
vi. Enhanced Cyber Risk Management
b. EUC-programme dependent deployment
i. DLP phase 2 blocking capability
ii. Office 365 event logging plat form through Microsoft Sentinel
iii. Licence Cost avoidance by incorporation of built in Microsoft security
tooling
c. SOC enhancements, cost coverage and cost reduction
i. Coverage of Belfast exit
ii. Insource of Verizon capability
iii. Rightsizing and organisation development
d. SPM security requirements and delivery

9. From our original plans we have deferred several capabilities until beyond the end of

a.

IRRELEVANT

10. Additionally, on target maturity levels, our Central risk team is presently revisiting cyber
risk appetite statements considering COVID working practices, the relaxation of certain
controls for extensive remote work practices and the reduction in capex. Changes in risk
appetite will necessarily result in changes to target maturity of cyber capabilities as they
are linked. Any necessary changes will be reported at the next meeting.

Report - How are we detecting and stopping current threats?

11. Fora 1-month period (15'" July - 15'* August) the Security Operations Centre (SOC) have
completed a tabletop exercise of how we would cope without them - i.e. assume that the
SOC is not there - what would we have missed.

12. The impact would have been
a. No proactive monitoring of several threat management systems that maintain
our enforcements through 100+ digital polices that are outside tower
agreements — we would miss all threat alerts
b. A varied range of security events, on average 30 events per day, 600 events
over the period
i. 150 Phishing attempts
ii. 20 Malware attempts
50 Vulnerabilities
iv. 30 Firewall rules improved
v. 60 investigations for policy breach (insider threat)
vi. 40 Network attack attempts
vii. 240 Threat intelligence assessments to brand and banking

13. Major investigations - high severity incidents include;

a. (DLP) Detected Asset with sensitive data with minimal access controls

b. (DLP) Employee Mass File delete detected, subsequent disciplinary proceedings
followed

c. (DLP) Detected user sending to personal mail, Data Breach recorded with DPO

d. (Phishing) Care Home phishing campaign, POL user compromised, Device
isolated and threat remediated

e. (Malware) User downloaded compromised file containing Malware, Device and
user account treated and threat remediated

f. (Threat Intelligence) 250 + events of detection and remediation, reports to
brands and banking provided, including details passed by to Capita

14. Lessons learned from this tabletop exercise:

a. EUC provider will only process Malware events under contract SLA (this has been
4 days in previous cases), POL SOC to take immediate action to resolve.

b. DLP is a major element of the daily incident count and requires constant
monitoring with POL business teams frequently operating outside information
security policy (DLP Phase 2 “analysis and pre enforcement activities” will
provide the analysis to the business to conduct an operations policy review in
Q4)

c. Attacks to our brand are constant and increasing, SOC provides this service as
this is outside any tower contract

d. POL SOC is operationally maxed out with current threat and incident volumes

e. More Security Integration Event Management (SIEM) data ingestion is required
to widen the threat intelligence capability

15. Appendix A shows the statistics that the SOC gathers on a regular basis and the dashboard
that we are using to drive the operational aspects of our work. At each of our following
meetings we will publish a dashboard for this forum covering key cyber metrics of interest
and the trends we are seeing.

Report - Ransomware

16. Ransomware attacks through the COVID period continued to increase in number and
sophistication. The recent issues faced by Travelex and their inability to rapidly recover
operations and reputation from a serious ransomware attack are a good example. Other
attacks continue on an almost daily basis.

17. Against that backdrop we asked Deloitte to help us by assessing our readiness for a
ransomware attack and to develop a playbook so that in the instance that we had such an
attack then we would be able to respond accurately and quickly.

18. The incident playbook has now been fully integrated into the incident process and this is
now fully aligned to the IT Major Incident Management process.

19. Further enhancements later this year will see the SOC move its incident ticket
management system to “ServiceNow” with full resolver group integration with the rest of
the IT service organisation. This will further increase our speed of response to ransomware

20. This change also supports the security operations integration with the “Cloud Centre of
Excellence” for AWS onboarding of Horizon architecture.

21. Our next steps in this area will be to share and compare with our key 3" parties.

(RCC) meetings.

Executive Summary

In our continued focus on Joiners, Movers, and Leavers we have performed a deep dive on
the Leavers process, as it is likely to present the most risk to the business. Our analysis
covers the period for which COVID-19 has been active as this has immediate relevance to the
operating model and challenges facing the business in the next few months. Short term and
longer-term actions are included. Subsequent papers will continue this analysis but will also
expand the focus to cover Joiners and Movers and other areas within Post Office Group.

Questions addressed

1. What are the complexities we need to address associated with the leavers process?

2. How well have we managed these complexities during the COVID-19 period from March
to July 2020?

3. What is the action plan?

4. What are the additional activities from a control's perspective around leavers?

Figure 1 Leavers Process

7. The process is made more complicated by the following factors:

a. There are different types of leaver that the process must take account of which
have implications for the risks and mitigations needed:

e Standard leavers initiated by an individual moving role outside of Post
Office or for example through retirement.

e Extraordinary leavers - For example, those who leave through a
compromise agreement or redundancy arrangements.

e Rapid leavers - such as those who exit in response to a disciplinary
issue.

e Health-related leavers - for those who have been long term sick for
over 2 years or in extreme circumstances through death.

b. There are different ways it can be triggered
i. Individuals trigger the process by resigning via a resignation letter to their
line manager. It is the line managers responsibility to lodge this on
Success Factors which initiates the leaving process through the HR
Service Centre.
ii. Alternatively, the organisation can trigger the leaving process directly on
Success Factors which is handled by HR.

c. Actual leave dates can vary - The contractual and final working dates for
individuals vary as many people leave and take holiday within their notice
period. Others are exited rapidly with gardening leave. Therefore, the date at
which access gets turned off for someone will vary from the actual contractual
leaving date.

8. These complications introduce extra risk into the process and are therefore a necessary
part of handling it.

How well have we managed the Leavers process during the COVID-19 period from
March to July 2020?

9. To gain insight into how well the Leavers process has worked during lockdown we have:

a. Logged all staff and contractor leavers during the COVID-19 virus from March to
July 2020 - there were 184 in total;

b. Cross-matched the leavers data with that held for IT access, returned laptops,
building access and payroll;

c. Interviewed those who are responsible for running the various elements of the
process to understand their experience with it;

d. Drawn conclusions from this activity which highlights how well we have
performed and where we need to do better.

10. What went well:

a. IT access for all leavers was removed on time. There were 6 people who
had in theory left but still had access available. On closer inspection those 6
were contractors who had been converted to permanent roles - explaining why
they were simultaneously in the leaver list but also still active. The
synchronisation between Success Factors and IT access systems therefore
appears to be working well. We propose to perform a deeper dive on data across
the whole of JML to further back this up.

b. The HR leaving process was in all cases started on time. HR confirmed
that all leavers were made known to HR in a timely fashion. This is critical to
the success of the process. The message is getting through to Line Managers
that they have a significant role to play. This will be reinforced ahead of the
September OE review through further training for all Line Managers.

c. Physical access and payroll were also terminated correctly for these
leavers.

11. What needs improvement:

a. The process for return of laptops and other kit. The leavers checklist
makes no mention of the need to contact someone about IT kit collection which
could result in line managers and leavers not returning kit. There is also no
formal process for informing IT operations that someone is leaving under current
working arrangements. This was easier when we all worked in a physical office
as people had a physical reminder of where to send kit. Now we are working
remotely then a newly initiated pickup by courier process is starting to have a
good effect. As IT have no formal notification the need to pick up kit then a
closer join up between IT and HR would help. This could be achieved through
linking the HR and IT service desks together.

b. Some leavers have deleted and downloaded confidential data. During
this period, our DLP platform noticed some above threshold patterns around
document access for certain leavers. In all cases accounts were locked pending
investigation of the severity of each case. For three of these there was a need
for further coordinated action by Cyber, HR and DPO. There needs to be clearer
guidance on the leavers checklist to cover what to do (and what not to do) with
data when leaving, even though this is already covered in policy documentation.

c. Core data issues seen. During this initial analysis there were glimpses of
issues surrounding cleanliness of data in HR and IT systems. The systems
appear to be working but the question remains are their further issues lurking
due to the state of the data. We will perform a deeper dive and clean up of this
data if needed.

d. Gaining access to data on JML for analysis. This has been surprisingly
difficult as POL do not have ready access to data - we need to raise requests to
go to 3™ parties which has an associated time delay with it and in some cases
cost implications.

What is the leavers action plan?

12. In summary our action plan is as follows

a. Update the Leavers Checklist and Line Managers guidance to include IT kit return
and data guidance for leavers [September 2020];

b. Implement a join up of HR and IT service desks [October 2020]

c. Explore ways to speed up data access [October 2020]

d. Perform a full analysis of all data across Success Factors and IT to ensure they
are in sync and accurate - [September to December 2020]

e. Expand analysis to Joiners and Movers - [November 2020]

f. Recruit a JML analyst for IT to further investigate data [September - October
2020]

What are the further actions we are taking around JML?

13. We are going to designate two new responsibilities for JML: IT System Platform Owner
(SPO) responsible for the IT elements of a platform and a Business Data Owner (BDO)
from the owning business who are accountable for the data in each system. Each of
these roles will have a lock-step role in managing JML as described below.

14. We will produce a monthly dashboard for the GE which will show all leavers by function.
There will be a three way sign off on this dashboard for each leaver from IT, HR and Line
Manager to assert that all necessary leave-related activities have been completed.

15. For movers we will perform a quarterly sweep by SPO and BDO to positively confirm:

a. What access people have had
b. What access people should have going forward

This will be prioritised for the top platforms initially

16. All privileged access for IT systems will be approved by SPO, CISO and CIO in addition
to the current process.

17. For key third parties, including Fujitsu, Verizon, Accenture and Computacenter we
already receive attestation of JML and Privileged Access Management on either a monthly
or quarterly basis. We will move this to monthly in all cases bearing in mind that this
may require contract adjustments. We will also add Ingenico to this list. As a next step
we will introduce spot auditing alongside attestation to increase the assurance level of
this activity.

18. On movers we are going to focus on our top 5 systems and for each we will validate the
movers process has the ability to tear down and build up access for movers, thereby
ensuring that access is not carried from one role to another.

19. The Deloitte Maturity assessment reported at the last meeting has made specific
recommendations about identity specifically focusing on the need for automation. We
will add these to our Cyber programme subject to funding approval.

20. Our COBIT 5- based controls framework covers JML. These controls are under review as
part of the enterprise-wide controls review under Legal and Compliance.

21. There is an internal audit review scheduled for Q3/4 of 2020. Terms of reference are
being developed now.

enewals we followed a fully OJEU-compliant procurement process.
The insurance market traditionally doesn’t use an OJEU-type process. Hence we saw
some success on certain lines and were able to ft. but on other more
specialised lines, for example :

3. In June 2020 we worked with Procurement (Antony Ray) and Legal (Ravi
Mudundi) to decide whether an OJEU process was required for the 2020 renewal.
Legal have concluded that, provided the broker (Lockton) was compliantly procured,
which it was, then we do not need to go through another procurement exercise and
we can simply instruct Lockton to secure the best policies for us. This is therefore the
approach that we are taking for the 2020 renewal.

4. Wewill provide an update to the ARC in September and, given the timeline for
renewal and company meeting dates, ask that authority to approve the final
programme is delegated to the Chairperson and Group Chief Finance Officer.

Input Sought:

Noting:

The Board is asked to note the new or proposed material changes to laws and regulations this month.

Previous Governance Oversight

Reported at each RCC & ARC

Executive Summary

There are 5 matters for the Committee to note (details of which are set out in the Appendix):

Le

Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) - Schrems II Decision - the CJEU is tightening rules
relating to transferring personal data to non-EEA countries using the Privacy Shield and
contractual arrangements (so called model clauses). For the moment the risks to Post Office group
is not significant because Post Office does not have many agreements containing model clauses.
However, Post Office must ensure that its IT strategy takes into account how personal data is
going to be transferred outside of the EEA and what counties Post Office will be comfortable with
sending the data to.

Ofcom Consultation - Implementing the new European Electronic Communications Code - Ofcom
is reviewing approach of the telephony providers to their customer, including fair outcomes, which
may result in need for material changes to the way the telecoms firms will be allowed to provide
their services. There is a risk to Post Office having to make changes that will impact its proposition
significantly. The full extent of the code will be clear once Ofcom issues revised statements.

Online Platform Regulations - This B2B regulation forces providers of platforms such as
aggregators websites (for example Confised.com) to provide its clients with information and tools
allowing more balanced distribution of bargaining power between the provider and the client. Post
Office and Post Office Insurance will be benefiting from these regulations as clients of aggregators
websites.

Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act - The enactment of the Act has been triggered by
Covid and the potential insolvency cases of suppliers of goods and services. The measures aim
to: (i) afford companies some breathing space (moratorium) from creditor action; (ii) provide a
space for restructuring compromise or arrangement without deepening financial difficulties; and
(iii) restriction on suppliers from terminating contracts or supply, or insisting on payment of sums
due where the client has entered into a relevant restructuring or insolvency process. Point (iii)
applies to Post Office’s contractual relationships with its clients and suppliers.

Online Platform
Regulations

The European Commission has
taken steps to redress a perceived
imbalance between online platforms
and the businesses which provide
goods and services on them by
introducing the Online Platforms
Regulation ("OPR”) that has been in
force since 12 July 2020.

OPR regulates business to business
practices and POL (and POMS) as
the clients are the beneficiaries of
the OPR.

The OPR is applicable to online
platforms, marketplaces, apps stores
and social media platforms, such as
MoneySupermarket or Confused.com
(OP Providers).

The OPR introduces a ban for the OP
Providers on carrying out certain
unfair practices for example,
suspension or termination of an
account without clear reasons, failure
to provide contracts in plain and
intelligible language, and failure to
give adequate notice for changes to
contracts.

Other measures include:
-Transparency requirements _ in
relation to the parameters used to
rank goods and services on their
site;
- Disclosing any advantage given to
their own products over others;

Post Office and POMS will be benefiting from the
changes because they are the users of aggregator
websites for some products, such as insurance or
loans.

Post Office and POMS will gain greater transparency
and rights within its agreements with OP Providers.

Post Office has already seen some
aggregators making contact with
amended terms to ensure
compliance with the OPRs and will
continue to engage.

In addition, Post Office has been
proactively asking aggregators
whether their terms reflect the
provisions of the OPR and is
ensuring this is captured in
negotiations regarding —_ future
contracts.

Legal are also to reach out to the
Telecoms team who are using OP
Providers to ensure alignment and
support is provided.

Executive Summary

1. The project implementing the CMF for the most material contracts across the PO Group
‘completed’ on 30 June 2020. All bar two of the 134 contracts identified by GE and GE-1
were located and uploaded onto Web3, with their obligations mapped?.

2. Given Covid-19 and other commercial challenges, the Audit & Risk Committee (“ARC”) in
May approved all other non-material legacy contracts being ‘remediated’ (e.g. located,
uploaded, mapped, contract manager assigned etc) via their respective natural ‘lifecycles’
as they are renewed, terminated and new contracts executed.

3. Against the original target of identifying, uploading and mapping obligations for 50 Material
Contracts with funding of c£300k - the project spent c£100k, uploaded and mapped the

1 Post Office Limited, Post Office Management Service, & Payzone Bill Payments Limited.
? We are working with the contract managers to obtain a signed version of the Kindred contract and locate the MediaZest contract
(which is said to be in hard copy only).

obligations for 132 Material Contracts?, 43 Non Material Legacy Contracts*, and identified
(and received) benefits of c£440,000°. c£200k of 19/20 approved funding and c£600k of
funding provisioned for in 20/21 (e.g. c£800k in total) has also been ‘released back’ to the
business.

Resource and processes are agreed with CoSec, Legal and Procurement to ensure new
contracts, as entered into across the PO Group, are compliant with the CMF.

Questions addressed

1. Did the project implementing the CMF for the most material contracts across the PO Group
result in all Material Contracts being uploaded onto Web 3 with their obligations mapped?
2. What further steps have been taken to ensure compliance with the CMF going forward?

Report

1. At the meeting on 19 May 2020, the ARC approved the recommended approach whereby

the project would:

e seek to complete the upload and mapping of all remaining contracts identified by the GE
and GE-1s as being material in terms of strategic and financial value by the end of June
2020 (“Material Contracts”); but

e for those contracts not identified as being material by the GE or GE-1s (“Non Material
Legacy Contracts”) - compliance with the CMF would be achieved through their
respective contractual ‘lifecycles’ e.g. as they are renewed, cease or new agreements
are entered into.

2. It was noted that new contracts, as executed, were not yet under the CMF and that there

would be ongoing annual costs of c£110k for licenses and resource costs in order to ensure
the CMF is adhered to going forward. These costs will be funded by the project for 9 months,
until July 2021, after which it will need to be funded as BAU.

Contracts:

4. In addition to the numbers set out above, the project team also uploaded onto Web 3 and
mapped the obligations for 43 Non Material Legacy Contracts.

5. There are two categories of contract which, post project, the PO Group needs to ensure
there are processes, resource and funding in place for ongoing compliance with the CMF to
be achieved:

a. The remaining Non Material Legacy Contracts which were not identified by the GE and
GE-1s as being material (in terms of financial or strategic value); of which there are
estimated to be c1,500.

b. New contracts the PO Group enters into (“New Contracts”), estimated at c30 per
calendar month.

6. Although the ARC approved the c1,500 remaining Non Material Legacy Contracts being
remediated over their natural lifecycle, the Source to Settle Programme (“S2SP”) has a
dependency on these contracts being uploaded onto Web3 in order to be able to realise its
benefits®. As such, the S2SP project is onboarding temporary resource out of limited
residual funds to identify, locate and upload the header level detail of as many as possible
of these contracts (but not map the obligations). This approach will allow the S2SP to realise
its benefits, with these contracts becoming fully compliant with the CMF as they expire or
are renewed i.e. in line with the ARC’s prior approval.

7. In respect of New Contracts:

a. The final version of the CMF, including Supplier Relationship Management, has been
agreed with Procurement and CoSec’. Processes are also being finalised with
Procurement and CoSec to ensure these contracts are uploaded onto the Web3
platform, as they are executed.

b. The Project will remain open for 9 months to fund the necessary resource to ensure:
- Contract Owners and Contract Managers are identified, appointed and complete the
internal CMF training delivered by the LCG Academy;
- The Contract Manager is given a user license and completes training on Web 3;

© Timely, automated advance notification of expiring contracts, and access to the contract documentation will allow the
Procurement team to effect compliant renewals and retendering processes particularly for small value contracts. More effective
demand management processes prior to contract notice periods commencing will also reduce cost over time.

7 Input has also been received from various other teams including IT, Post Office Insurance and Payzone Bill Payments Limited.

- The new contract is uploaded onto Web 3; and
- The obligation mapping is completed by the Contract Manager for the contract.

At the end of this period, funding or headcount will need to be provided in order to ensure
ongoing compliance with the CMF.

c. Templates: The Legal team is populating Web3 with the updated template agreements
from across all PO Group members. Contract Managers will be able to use these
templates to negotiate contracts on the PO Group’s standard terms and conditions.
Supplier contracts will continue to be negotiated by the Procurement team with the
support of the Contract Manager and other SME’s.

d. Contract Managers ‘Community of Practice’: There is a ‘Teams’ site for all Contract
Managers, which hosts key artefacts and training resources. IT vendor managers have
created a community on Yammer that Contract Managers will be able to use to learn
from each other, share their experiences, ask questions and support each other.

e. Success Factors Training: Every employee across the PO Group should be:
° aware of the CMF;
. directed to the right resources;
. aware of the procedures and controls implemented.

To ensure ongoing compliance and awareness the ARC is asked to give approval for the
development and deployment of short annual mandatory training on the CMF and Public
Contract Regulations for all Contract Owners and Contract Managers, across the PO
Group, via Success Factors. The Learning and Development Team has been engaged
and are supportive, pending approval from the RCC and ARC.

POST OFFICE LIMITED RCC REPORT

Title: Update on Postmaster Accounts pani 10 September 2020
Author: Tim Perkins Sponsor: Alisdair Cameron

Input Sought:
The RCC is asked to note:

e The update on Postmaster customer accounts following a request at ARC in July 2020.
The RCC is asked to approve the recommended approach:

e Whereby, following the review of Stamps processes, KPMG are instructed to explore
whether there are other identified product processes that could give rise to similar issues
as those identified with Stamps.

Previous Governance Oversight
« None

Executive Summary

1. The Audit and Risk Committee asked, following KPMG'‘s reviews of the current operation of
suspense accounts and stamps processes, for an overview of the processes deployed to
inform Postmasters of balances on their customer accounts and for consideration to be given
to reviewing other product processes in line with the review on stamps.

2. Postmasters with a balance on their account are sent a letter (or letters) on a trading period
basis encouraging them to make contact with Post Office to discuss the balance. The letters
sent by Post Office changed significantly following the Common Issues Judgment and Post
Office also stopped automatically deducting balances from remuneration when no contact
was made by a Postmaster. The revised processes and letters have been independently
reviewed and approved by Norton Rose Fulbright as reflecting the requirements of the
Common Issues Judgment.

3. Post Office has seen balances posted to Postmaster customer accounts fall over the last 20
months, with decreases in both the volume and value of balances posted. This reduction in
balances posted to customer accounts is in line with a reduction in the level of losses in
branches.

4. However, the overall balance on Postmaster customer accounts has risen over the same time
period, primarily as a result of reduced recovery after stopping automatic deduction from
remuneration for Postmasters after the Common Issues Judgment.

5. Post Office is currently reviewing its Loss Recovery policies and processes and completing a
review of its aged debt and these reviews will conclude in Q3 2020.

6. Following the review of stamp related processes, it is recommended that the RCC approve
instructing KPMG, at a cost of c£106k, to perform a similar piece of assurance work across
Post Office's wider product portfolio, in respect of both current and historic processes.

Questions addressed

1. What processes are in place to inform Postmasters of balances on their customer account?

2. What trends are prevalent or emerging in Postmaster customer accounts?

3. What further work could KPMG perform to assess whether any other product processes
could have given rise to similar issues to those identified with stamps? How much would
this cost? What are the limitations and risks?

Report
Informing Postmasters of balances on Postmaster customer accounts

1. Every Postmaster has a customer account for each branch that they operate. These are the
accounts used to hold balances that are settled centrally at the end of a trading period.

2. Branches are expected to complete trading period accounting 12 times a year on a 5 week,
4 week, 4 week schedule at the end of each trading period. Branches are organised into 4
balancing groups (A-D) - this means that in 12 of any 13 weeks, there will be a group of
branches scheduled to complete their trading period accounting and balances will be posted
to Postmaster customer accounts.

3. On the Monday following the scheduled branch balancing date, a letter is sent to the
Postmaster by the Loss Recovery team informing them of any balance on their account.
This letter is appended to this paper as Appendix A. If, by the following Tuesday, the
Postmaster has not contacted the Loss Recovery team to discuss the balance on their
account, a second letter is sent by way of follow up. This letter is appended to this paper
as Appendix B. A copy of a statement of their customer account is enclosed with both
letters sent to the Postmaster. A redacted version is appended to this paper as Appendix
c.

4. The letters sent to Postmasters regarding balances on their accounts have been changed
significantly since the Common Issues Judgment. It is also worth noting that Post Office
used to automatically deduct monies owed by a Postmaster from their remuneration when
there was no response to letters. This practice stopped immediately after the Common
Issues Judgement.

5. The revised processes and letters have been independently reviewed and approved by
Norton Rose Fulbright as reflecting the requirements of the Common Issues Judgment.

6. Post Office is currently completing a thorough review of its Loss Recovery policies and
processes and is considering other opportunities, such as the use of Branch Hub, to allow
Postmasters to monitor the balances on their customer account(s). The review will conclude
in Q3 2020-21.

Postmaster current accounts - analysis and trends

7. The balances settled centrally by branches at the end of each trading period have been
falling in the last 20 months. Apart from in TP04 2020, the year on year balances settled
centrally by branches have fallen year on year in each trading period of the last 20.

8. The reduction in balances settled centrally is driven by a reduction in both the volume of
branches settling balances centrally and the average value being settled centrally.

9. This pattern aligns with the reduction in the total level of declared losses across the
network. Appendix D shows the reduction in both declared losses and balances settled
centrally over the past 20 months.

10.The reduction in declared losses is driven by an increase in the monitoring of branches, an

increase in the support provided to branches and through more frequent earlier intervention

for branches that are having operational issues. The focus of the Loss Prevention team has
been on ensuring that network trading compliance has improved (completion of cash
declarations, trading period accounting and stock remittances), increasing contact levels
with branches to offer enhanced support (through SPEAR visits and calls) and offering
enhanced reactive support for balancing issues through Tier 2 Branch Support.

11.The table below shows the average number of branches settling balances centrally per week
and the average value of the balances settled centrally:

Trading Period Average number of branches settling a balance ‘Average value of balances settled

centrally per week centrally

TPO4 2020 41 £144,284
TPOS 2020 58 £106,577

12.Whilst the value being settled to Postmaster customer accounts on an ongoing basis has
fallen, the total value held in Postmaster customer accounts has increased over the same
period. This is due to lower levels of recovery primarily as a result of Post Office no longer
automatically deducting balances held in Postmaster customer accounts from remuneration
payments.

13.There is currently £4.1m of debt held on Postmaster customer accounts for current
Postmasters and there is £13.3m of debt held on Postmaster customer accounts for former
Postmasters.

14.The £13.3m debt for former Postmasters has been fully provided for in Post Office’s
accounts and has a number of aged cases within it. The £4.1m of debt for current
Postmasters also contains a number of aged cases with all debt over 60 days in age fully
provided for in Post Office’s accounts.

15.The review of Post Office’s Loss Recovery processes will also consider, in conjunction with
the Historical Matters programme, how to manage and resolve aged debt in the Postmaster
customer accounts.

Assessment of further product processes following the Stamps review

16.A recent review of Post Office’s stamps processes found limited evidence of detriment
suffered by Postmasters as a result of weaknesses in Post Office’s stamps processes and
controls. These findings have been reported to the ARC and Board and Post Office is now
establishing a Scheme to provide redress to Postmasters who may have suffered detriment.

17.Stamps are one product set from a wide portfolio of products sold by Post Office and
transacted through the Horizon system.

18.The stamps review commenced as a result of internal identification of potential risk in the
processes.

19.Whilst there have been no further products or product sets identified internally that are
deemed to have similar risks to stamps, Post Office is looking to adopt a holistic approach
by undertaking a high level review of its product portfolio in order to identify key risk areas
and any products with specific process issues that may have the potential to cause product-
related branch discrepancies and where Postmasters may have suffered detriment as a
result of these or as a result of the monthly discrepancy settlement process.

20.This review will include, as a minimum, processes for ATMs, Camelot (lottery and
scratchcards), Paystation, Moneygram, Postal Orders, Foreign Exchange and Traveller’s
Cheques. The review will consider current and historical processes, where historical
processes are known.

21.It is recommended that the RCC approve instructing KPMG to complete this review. KPMG
has provided a cost estimate of c£106k to complete this work.

22.The RCC should note that any documentation which is produced and findings made, may
be disclosable as part of Post Office’s ongoing disclosure obligations to those it has
prosecuted historically and as part of any future claims made against Post Office as a result
of historical practices, in both a civil and criminal context and in the context of any future
investigation or inquiry.

Background & Context 5
3
+ Success Factors is currently one of the leading HRIS platforms used by over 6850 organisations and over 125m users worldwide. It offers m
modules to support the management of people data and the processing of employee activity throughout the employee journey providing
automation and mobile access to key HR services. Like most comparable products on the market, Success Factors can be heavily
g customised, however, it operates at an optimal level, when it supports consistent data sets and common, simple processes
9
3 + Success Factors HR suite was first purchased by POL as part of a settlement of a SAP Audit in 2016, which found POL to be significantly
5 under licensed on SAP products. The agreement removed the liabilities on the licence issue and offered a full Cloud solution to deliver key

HR services via the Success Factors platform (including payroll and HR data) - this formed a key pillar of the 2016 HR Transformation
Programme. The agreement meant that the Success Factors (SF) purchase was not subject to the full procurement process

+ The original implementation of ‘Success Factors’ at POL was not without challenge. The design was not fully scoped and the project failed
to address the complex processes that are in play across POL HR, attempting instead to build workarounds for the anomalies and lack of
consistency in the contractual agreements with our people. In short, the project tried to overlay complex and inconsistent ways of working
onto a new technology platform that offered the greatest benefits when paired with simplicity and commonality. This resulted in a mix of an
underutilised system and manual workarounds that eliminated efficiency gains

+ Following delays and a substantial increase in budget, an external audit (by PWC) recommended a positive go-live decision and SF payroll
was launched in January 2018. Following the payroll launch an internal audit revealed further issues with the implementation. Other
modules introduced included Recruitment, Onboarding, Performance & Goals and Learning. Whilst these modules have introduced benefits
and value to the organisation, it is recognised that the configuration of these modules at the time was also not optimal

S
8

+ Changes in HR Leadership, organisation strategy and the Covid 19 situation have interrupted and slowed progression to resolve the issues
raised with Success Factors. However, since the start of 2020, concrete actions have been taken to identify and prioritise activity that will
drive and maximise the value we obtain from the system. This includes addressing the complexity of HR as we develop the HR TOM

Success Factors IS already adding value at the Post Office

PERFORMANCE & PENSIONS

PAYROLL %

Ability to run frequent ‘test’ payruns has reduced errors and
eliminated system downtime during investigations

Exceptions reporting is more advanced and efficient. For example,
the test run highlights risks with employees who are outside
regulatory requirements (eg. Minimum wage)

Payslip and P60 production are automated and available online,
reducing costs and requests for duplicates

Other processes such as payment for court orders, tax code
changes and student loan deductions are now automated and
have removed manual processes - prone to input error

Performance process is run online for all grade 2b and above
employees. Success Factors has improved transparency and
consistency in the process and created more accurate reporting.
Nearly 90% of eligible employees have objectives recorded in the
system

The online performance process has eliminated a number of
manual spreadsheet conciliation processes

The first round of Pensions Auto-Enrolment has been completed
using SF

RECRUITMENT

LEARNING

The Learning Module is available to over 3400 ‘learners’

98% of learners find the online learning ‘easy to navigate’

Moving compliance training onto Success Factors has improved
compliance reporting and has reduced the average time window
taken in which to complete the training from 23 days to just 4 days
Aside from online learning, the system also manages
administration for 432 facilitated sessions — over the last 12
months it has managed over 2800 course bookings

EEE <
Process now sits in one system rather than two — improving the
user experience

All user data now sits on one page rather than across multiple

The BIG Questions

siojoRJssacong :aniqdeaq

Is Success Factors fit for purpose — What are the current risks we face with the product?

Success Factors is without doubt, one of the leading HRIS platforms used globally. It may not be perfect, but it should be noted that, on average, at
POL it has over 500 log ins per day and delivers many essential HR services including Payroll, Onboarding, Recruitment, Performance and
Learning. It has also introduced employee ‘self serve’ processes which will be key to future HRSC development.

The success of any HRIS is wholly dependent on the quality of the design and build and it is clear that the original configuration was not optimal and
whilst the required functionality sits within the system it is often not being fully utilised. The complexities of the business operations have resulted in a
complicated build that is difficult to maintain and update and is supported by many manual workarounds.

The main risks that the organisation faces with SF is that we continue to try and configure and ‘fix’ the system issues without addressing the business
processes that are driving them. Simplifying processes, aligning policy where possible and removing complexity will address the risk and reduce,
rework, duplication of activity, maintenance and development costs. In some areas of the business, SF has also lost credibility, which could be
regained through delivery of improved ‘user focussed’, simplified processes.

Are there alternative products or upgrades to be considered?

There are many alternative products available providing a connected suite of HR service modules (Workday being the main competitor - but this also
has limitations). Another option is sourcing independent systems to meet specific service requirements (eg. learning, payroll, performance
management). These would require significant investment and integration to implement, run and connect and usually result in a more complex system
landscape.

It should be noted that any new implementation would likely end in the same result unless processes and ways of working are significantly
simplified and there is an acknowledgement that the system and accompanying processes have to be built for the majority / future state -
not to support small legacy populations with specific needs who may not play a part in the longer term strategy.

The BIG Questions

siojoeJssacong :aniqdeag LL qe

If Success Factors is retained, how can we maximise the return on investment? (for example, in staff training, capability building to reduce
errors and adopting and embedding new ways of working)

+ Simplification of core processes, simplification of org structures through POM and ongoing work to align T&Cs and employment contracts is
underway. Quick wins from a Deloitte review from March 2020 are being applied as a part of the process improvement stream that is inflight.
Together, these will deliver efficiencies and system improvements that will add real value by removing complexity, duplication, rework, manual work
arounds etc.

+ Asa part of the continued development of the HRSC we will naturally look to harness the Success Factors technology, where possible to provide
increased automation, self service and mobile access. This will reduce the business reliance on outdated, laborious HRSC processes and will lead
to a more efficient, leaner HR function

+ Weill also looking to update Role Based Permissions (RPB) to ensure that HR administrators have wider access to complete HR activity
workflows in the system rather than pass small activities from team to team (with different permissions) to administer. This creates further process
efficiencies, increases process control and reduces risk from handoffs

+ — Internal PR and training around system functionality will be improved to create new excitement and demonstrate clear benefits

Simple system efficiencies adding value:

Poor user experience.
Complex system build
with greater risk of failure

Unaligned data and Complex organisation
Complex processes 7 policies structure
and increased costs to run

Currently 1FTE spends several hours each day
running reports and contacting managers to
inform them that they need to follow up ongoing
absence.

Improved user
experience, system
simplicity, reduced risk,
lower cost base

Better aligned data and ‘Simpler organisation
Simplified processes =a policies” structure

An automated flag is being added to the system
that will send a reminder to Managers
automatically — saving significant effort every day

@.

* There will never be complete alignment and will always be exceptions, but systems should be built around the
majority and not overly customised to meet niche needs and anomalies — which drive complexity, cost and risk

Summary of Activity Findings

ejssaoong :aniqdeeq 11 qeL

+ The Deloitte high level review revealed 51 opportunities that would improve the integrity of the system and improve functionality, connectivity,
governance and reporting (See appendix for full list)

+ Of the 51 opportunities, 21 ‘quick wins’ were identified which could be delivered relatively easily with minimal cost.

+ 22 opportunities were identified as ‘Priority’ based on value add. These have been ‘combined’ and worked up into 14 ‘prioritised opportunities’

+ The Process Improvement workstream is developing these opportunities at a more detailed level and is looking more broadly at processes
across the HRSC.

+ — Including the Deloitte activity, 176 process improvement opportunities have been identified that could result in an estimated 32% time
saving (currently at Prove Plan)

+ — Initial focus on developing 2 key processes is estimated to save 1FTE

+ Asa part of the work all processes are being fully documented

+ Support, Training and a control forum are being worked into the new HRSC development work

+ An additional opportunity for a HRSC service management tool integrated with SF has been identified as another way to streamline
HRSC ways of working and improve the customer experience but would require additional funding

Of the 51 opportunities identified by Deloitte, 21 were ‘quick wins’ which could be delivered relatively easily with minimal cost. Each of these ‘quick wins’
has been factored in to the Process Improvement workstream and have been worked into the timeline — Some actions — like, improving data
configuration, RBP and notification changes will be adopted alongside the review and development of each process and therefore will be actioned over
the lifespan of the wider project. ‘Go live’ of each element may also be dependent on the Accenture roadmap, resource availability and other changes

Considerations and Risks Regarding the Future of Success Factors 5
+ Post Office has invested significant money, time and effort to date in Success Factors — and the system is delivering benefits. Any suggested a
alternative HRIS would require significant investment without there being any guarantee that the service delivery or efficiency would be improved
2 * Bringing in any alternative system before addressing the issues that created the problems within Success Factors will set us up to fail and sink

more funding. The complexity of the existing set up (data and processes) makes moving to another system or outsource provider extremely risky
at a time when the business is focussed on other priorities

* There may be other opportunities to reduce running costs. Existing contracts should be challenged around licences and the support model — we
may be able to leverage more value from the existing set up with less effort and need to reduce the reliance on a 3 party for small enhancements

+ If we want to maximise returns from the system, further funding may be required in the short term to speed up delivery of changes that will ensure
regulatory or legal compliance or enhancements and changes that could deliver greater value / ROI in the longer term. Ongoing development is
included in the current overall tech enablement budget for OE covering small developments. Any significant additional development will be costed
and assessed against value add — before work commences (which may change the delivery plan)

Fi

a

+ Whilst SF is primarily an HR system, other functions, such as IT and Finance will need to be actively involved in the decisions around it’s
development and future role.

* The TOM for the HRSC should be outlined before any long term decisions are made on the future of SF. The SF development plan will need to run
alongside the development of the HRSC TOM

+ In April ‘20 the current SF contract was extended by 2 years to April 22. Time did not allow for a full procurement review and activity around Covid
19 took priority in both HR and IT

* The procurement process for sourcing any alternative is likely to take 12 months — which would result in the existing issues being ‘lived with’. It
would delay the full implementation of the HR TOM until the new system was developed to support — otherwise we risk a new structure and ways
of working being hampered by existing technology we are not able to invest in

J
Recommendation 3

The ARC are requested to agree to the following recommendation relating to the future of SF @ POL:

Short / Medium Term (1-2 years)

2
9 At the current time it is recommended that in the short/medium term, Success Factors remains the central HR tool around which process
8 improvements and the future HR TOM is built. It is delivering core HR services and, work underway now to simplify HR operations will
5 provide a solid base on which to enhance and obtain more value from the system — although this may require some additional funding in
g the short term — which could determine / alter the delivery timeline. The introduction of a dedicated HRIT Governance & Innovation Forum
a alongside the existing HRSC governance processes will add increased rigour and control to the development and BAU operations of the
a system.

Long Term

8
a
g

It is recommended that we carry out regular ‘Heath Checks’ on Success Factors and that it is reviewed again in one year — allowing the
current organisation change and efficiency projects (POM) to begin to take effect. At this point, we will have started to implement a
simplified organisation with a reduced headcount and increased alignment across HR T&Cs and ways of working. The HRSC will be

$ operating more efficiently and will have a clear view on whether the technology is meeting requirements or not.
8 This ‘Health Check’ will be an early indicator to show if Success Factors can continue to meet the needs of the business in the longer
term. If a decision is taken to look at alternatives, we can do so, knowing that many of the complexities that have resulted in the issues
experienced in the initial implementation will have been resolved — making further development of SF OR implementation of an
alternative HRIS much more likely to succeed.

Key Lessons Learned From Initial SF Implementation

In March 2018, the Change Assurance Report carried out a ‘Lessons Learnt Review’ which fed into the FY17-18 Annual Audit Plan (approved by

POL00401629
POL00401629

siojoeJssacong :aniqdeag LL qe

ARC). The aim was to understand the issues that occurred and the reasons for the delays and overspend. The key themes of the issues highlighted

were:

Design — There was a lack of overarching governance in relation to the solution design — There was no Design Authority in place and no formal
review of the high level design and detailed requirements. Certain functionality requirements were missed as an impact analysis was not carried out.

Testing — Poor test approach identified and a lack of compliance with the test strategy. Test scripts were not detailed enough

Data — The process for loading data into SF continually changed — migration was hindered by poor data quality

Specific areas of concern identified - regarding the management of the project included:

Project Planning
1) Lack of in-depth planning prior to project initiation
2) Absence of a resource management strategy

Project Performance
3) Ineffective test governance

Project Governance
4) Non compliance with project governance requirements
5) Lack of alignment between contractual documentation and project deliverables

Raid Management
6) Inconsistent RAID management and lack of third party risk strategy

It has since been noted that some of the SF1 Gating Go/No Go documentation has gone missing.

This appears to have happened during a transfer of the documentation.

=
=

2020 Response:

Since the original implementation, there
have been changes in leadership and
delivery teams within both HR and SPO.
New processes have been implemented
to prevent a repeat of the issues raised
and ensure strong governance across all
aspects of programme management.
An update to the ARC, detailing the
processes and controls which have
been implemented across Change is

planned for November ’20.

1. Overview

1.1. Introduction by the Policy Owner

The Procurement Director has overall accountability to the Board of Directors for the
governance and implementation of controls applied to procurement activities for goods
and services. The Procurement Policy and its associated processes and controls are an
agenda item for the Audit and Risk Committee and the Post Office Board is updated as
required.

Post Office spends approximately £500m per annum on goods and services from third
parties. From an operational and commercial perspective, the management of this
expenditure is critical in achieving commercial sustainability within the legal framework
set out for public procurement with which Post Office Ltd must comply.

The Policy sets out the manner in which the Post Office will govern the procurement

I activities for goods and services. It covers processes in which the Procurement teams with
cross functional stakeholders identify, qualify and engage a strong supplier base, ensuring
compliance and reliable supply.

This Policy should be read in conjunction with related policies setting out the processes in
which the organisation sources and selects and contracts with its suppliers, executes the
purchasing processes through defined and controlled purchasing channels, and
commercially and operationally manages the services on an ongoing basis (see links to
associated policies and processes in Appendix C)

1.2. Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to set out the way in which the Post Office will govern the
procurement activities for goods and services including the selection of suppliers and the
sourcing and procurement exercises.

It is one of a set of policies which provide a clear risk and governance framework and an
effective system of internal control for the management of risk across the Post Office,
Compliance with these policies supports the Post Office in meeting its business objectives
and to balance the needs of shareholders, employees and other stakeholders.

For definitions please see section 3.1.

1.3. Core Principles

Procurement is the act of obtaining goods or services, typically for business purposes.
‘Sourcing is the process of defining the required goods and services, the execution of tender
or bid process and, the evaluation of responses, selection and appointment process for the
preferred bidder.

The over-riding procurement policy requirement is that all public procurement must be
based on value for money, defined as “the best mix of quality and effectiveness for the
least outlay over the period of use of the goods or services bought”. This should be
achieved through competition There are limited exemptions to when a competition is
not required, these set out within the legal framework. Public authorities can award on
the basis of: (i) price or cost alone (taking into account cost effectiveness); (i) fix the price
and just evaluate on quality; or (ii) a combination of these two options. Provided the basis on

which a commercial response shall be evaluated is communicated clearly, in advance of bid
submissions and fully adhered to, this is compliant.

Public sector procurement is subject to a legal framework which encourages free and open
competition and value for money, in line with EU and domestic law and EU and UK
Government guidance. There is also law and guidance to support growth by improving
SME access to public contracts, particularly for low value contracts. This may require the
advertisement of public contract opportunities and the publication of contract awards.

Procurement at Post Office shall be driven by the following Guiding Principles in all
procurement activities:

Cost

+ Achieve sustained value by progressively managing POL's expenditure, maximising
value and seeking continuous improvement and innovation for the Post Office.

Contract
+ Reduce operational, commercial, reputational and legal risk to the Post Office by
ensuring contracts which are fit for purpose are in place to ensure the delivery of
goods and services to the agreed requirements, to seek continuous improvement
from the commercial relationship agreements, and with appropriate levels of control
and oversight as relevant to the goods and service supplied

Compliance

+ To ensure that procurement activity carried out within the Post Office complies with
the relevant regulations in respect of public sector procurement, EU and UK
guidance,and in accordance with Post Office governance and risk management.

+ Compliance to internal Post office Group policy on consultation with key stakeholders
ensuring they have been advised of, consulted and approved where appropriate in
line in advance of and during a procurement process. Key Stakeholders may include
Compliance [Data Protection, Regulatory, Financial Crime], Information Security,
Legal, Business Continuity, Corporate Responsibility, HR and Finance;

Consolidation
+ Deliver efficiencies to Post Office by managing the supply base to consolidate spend
with onboarded strategic suppliers, and to optimise the total number of suppliers
and contracts requiring direct management.

1

.4. Applicatio
This Policy is applicable to Post Office Ltd and defines the minimum standards to control
financial loss, customer impact, regulatory breaches and reputational damage in line with
the Post Office’s Risk Appetite.

The risk to the Group from Procurement is reviewed by the board annually.

In exceptional circumstances, where the procurement activity sits outside of the Post
Office’s accepted Risk Appetite a Procurement Risk Exception can be submitted for Board
review and approval. For further information in relation to the risk exception process
please contact the Risk & Assurance team.

2. Risk Appetite and Minimum Control
Standards
2.1. Risk Appetite
Risk Appetite is the extent to which the Post Office will accept that a risk might happen
in pursuit of day to day businesses transactions. It therefore defines the boundaries of
activity and levels of exposure that the Post Office is willing and able to tolerate.
The Post Office takes its legal and regulatory responsibilities seriously and consequently
has:
* Tolerant risk appetite for Legal and Regulatory risk in those limited circumstances
where there are significant conflicting imperatives between conformance and
commercial practicality
*  Averse risk appetite for litigation in relation to high profile cases/issues
+ Averse risk appetite for litigation in relation to Financial Services matters
+ Averse risk appetite for not complying with law and regulations or deviation from

2.2. Policy Framework

Post Office has established a suite of Procurement policies and procedures, on a risk
sensitive approach which are subject to'an annual review. The Policy suite is designed to
assist with Supplier Management, Contractual Processes, and Procurement exercises these
have been developed to comply with applicable legislation and regulation.

2.3. Who must comply?

This policy applies to all employees who procure goods and service from external
suppliers. Compliance with this policy is mandatory for all business units within Post Office
Ltd [POL]. Other Group entities [Post Office Insurance and Payzone] operate under
separate Procurement Policies as they are not subject to Public Contract Regulations.
Supporting processes must be complied with by these Group entities where clearly stated.

In the case of agencies and consultancies, all contracted personnel working on behalf of
POL shall be made aware of this policy and shall comply with all procurement procedures
listed within the Procurement department guidance.

All employees who procure from suppliers should work to our values Care, Challenge and
‘Commit and our standards set out in the Code of Business Standards and the other POL

of POL; mitigate the risks faced by POL; and support the quality of service we provide to
our customers, our policies and other legal requirements (including finance, health and
safety, human rights and labour standards, and employment laws);

Where non-compliance is identified the matter must be referred to the Procurement
Director, Director of Risk, Compliance Director and the Group Legal Director. Any
investigations will be carried out in accordance with the Investigations Policy. Where is it
identified that that an instance of non-compliance is caused through wilful disregard or
negligence, this will be treated as a disciplinary offence.

2.5. Minimum Control Standards

A minimum control standard is an activity which must be in place in order to manage the risks so they remain within the defined Risk
Appetite statements. There must be mechanisms in place within each business unit to demonstrate compliance. The minimum control
standards can cover a range of control types, i.e. directive, detective, corrective and preventive which are required to ensure risks are
managed to an acceptable level and within the defined Risk Appetite.

1. Overview

1.1. Purpose of this guidance

This guidance has been established to set the minimum operating standards relating to
the risk management of procurement activity under PCR threshold values. These
thresholds are updated every two years to account for exchange rate variations between
the UK and the Eurozone. throughout the Post Office Ltd.It forms an appendix to the Post
Office Ltd Procurement Policy 2020.

1.2.C

Since the 1970s, the EU has adopted legislation to ensure that the EU public procurement
market is open and competitive and that suppliers are treated equally and fairly. The rules
cover aspects such as advertising of contracts, procedures for assessing company
credentials, awarding the contracts and remedies (penalties) when these rules are
breached.

Principles

The EU rules are contained in a series of directives that are updated from time to time
Member states have to make national legislation (regulations) to implement the EU rules
in domestic law by certain deadlines. The most recent update of the EU procurement
directives was in April 2014

EU Public Contracts Directive 2014;

+ Public Contracts Regulations 2015;

+ The EC treaty principles underpin the EU law,

‘+ There is also a substantial body of EU and UK case law on the application of the
directive and regulations;

+ EU and UK government guidance (including PPNs from Cabinet Office),

This policy identifies the key practical issues that feature in below threshold procurements
including the need to advertise, the impact of the Treaty on the Functioning of the
European Union [TFEU] on the award of contracts and the risks of not observing the rules.

1.3. Applicati

This guidance is applicable to all areas within the Post Office Ltd and defines the minimum
standards to control financial loss, customer impact, regulatory breaches and reputational
damage in line with the Post Office Ltd’s’s Risk Appetite. This guidance will be reviewed
annually in line with the Procurement Policy it forms part of.

In exceptional circumstances, where risk sits outside of the Post Office Ltd’s accepted Risk
Appetite a Procurement Risk Exception can be raised and submitted to Board for review
and approval.

For the avoidance of doubt, all Procurement Risk Exceptions of any value will be referred
to Board.

For further information in relation to the risk exception process please contact Procurement
and the Risk & Assurance team

1.4. The Risk

The principles set out in the TFEU (Treaty Principles) will generally apply to all actions of
a contracting authority except where there is no cross border interest.

This appendix sets out the key controls and guidance in relation to Sub-threshold
procurements for Supply and Services contracts only. Please consult with Procurement if
contemplating any other contract set out within 1.6 “OJEU Thresholds”.

1.5. Post Office policy on Sub Threshold Procurement
Detailed legal guidance on Sub Threshold Procurement is set out within 1.6 of this
document.
1.5.4. Awards under £25k
a) Awards under £25k may be made without a competitive process subject to

Procurement view that Cross Border interest does not apply. Such awards must be
one off in nature and not be for recurring goods and services.

b) "Slicing and dicing” of awards for the purposes of staying under this threshold is
against the law.

) Where the ongoing requirement is unknown at the point of award, it should be
assumed that a competitive process will be required for any subsequent extensions
or contracts, where the cumulative value will breach £25k.

d) Business units should therefore consider whether it is more expedient to run a
competitive process from the outset to reduce the risk of business or project
disruption.

e) Business units should consult with Procurement as to whether the use of a

Corporate Purchasing Card is a more efficient route to market.

f) Contracts must be executed on Post Office terms and conditions and payment terms
may not'be varied without written approval from a Finance Director.

g) No financial or contractual commitment may be made to the supplier until a
contract has been executed in line with Post Office Contract Execution Policy.

h) Where the opportunity is deemed to be of cross border interest, the opportunity
must be advertised on Contracts Finder and a transparent procurement process
must be run,

1.5.2. Awards between £25k and the PCR threshold

Please note:

Breaches of this policy will be investigated and may result in referral to HR.

All breaches will be treated as a Procurement Risk Exception and will be reviewed
by Board

In making a sub threshold award to a third party between £25k and £189,330 the following
Post Office policy applies: ‘Commented [8B3}: This is the proposed policy. For ]

b) The opportunity must be publicly advertised on Contracts Finder.

) A competitive process must be run.
d) Notice of the award must be published in a timely way.
Where it is argued that there is no cross border interest:

a) Procurement, with business unit support will examine and prepare a briefing note
for Legal in respect of any LRN,

b) [The business unit must bear the cost of preparing the Legal Risk Note. _— (Commented (883): Placeholder for discussion }

c) IA competitive process should be run, [but is not mandatory]where time permits in
order to facilitate better value for money, enhanced service offerings and better

terms and conditions, ‘Commented [B84]: Note that this is proposed internal
policy but is nota legal requirement.

Awards which do not comply with these principles will be treated as a Procurement Risk
Exception and will be subject to Board oversight.

Please also note the same principles apply for awards > £25k:

a) “Slicing and dicing” of awards for the purposes of staying under this threshold is
against the law.

b) Where the ongoing requirement is unknown at the point of award, it should be
assumed that a competitive process will be required for any subsequent extensions
or contracts, where the cumulative value will breach the upper threshold over the
term of the contract.

¢)

Business units should therefore consider whether it is more expedient to run a
compliant above threshold process from the outset to

reduce the risk of business or project disruption where a change in provider
may result in a requirement to transfer knowledge, skills and loss of
acquired knowledge.

b. Build in financial contingency for delays, additional requirement and

Tab 12 Policies for Approval

Below threshold contracts are those contracts which are valued below the OJEU
thresholds. The OJEU thresholds are currently:

(a) Works £4,733,252

(b) Supply and Service Contracts (sub-central authorities) £189,330
(©) Light Touch Regime £663,540

(d) Concession Contracts £4,733,252

2. Is procurement law concerned with below threshold contracts?

Yes. When placing below threshold public works, services, supplies or concessions
contracts POL must comply with:

(a) Treaty Principles? where contracts attract Cross Border interest.

(b) the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 (the Regulations) which
impose obligations on POL when awarding contracts which are
2£25k.*

(©) any internal guidance, to the extent applicable.®

FN2 - Rules on accumulation

When assessing whether an OJEU threshold has been met, POL should have regard to the
rules on accumulation of contracts. These are contained in regulation 6 of the Regulations.
These can require POL to accumulate the value of multiple contracts when assessing
whether the OJEU threshold has been met. For example, the value of regular purchases
made over a period of 12 month should be accumulated for the purposes of calculating
whether the values of such contracts meet the OJEU threshold.

A contract can in isolation appear to be below threshold, however, when the rules on
accumulation are applied, it and related contracts may need to be treated as above OJEU
threshold contracts,

FN3 - Does a contract have cross border interest?
1 What is cross border interest?

A contract will have cross border interest if it is of interest to suppliers located in
other EU Member States (this includes suppliers which are UK subsidiaries of EU
companies).

2 How do we know if a contract has cross border interest?
This is an objective test. The key question is

Would the realistic hypothetical European bidder have bid for the contract
had the opportunity arisen?

POL00401629
POL00401629

Tab 12 Policies for Approval

There is no definitive list of factors to be taken into account when considering
whether there is cross border interest. However POL should at least consider the
following

(a) value of the contract;
(b) _ location of the works/services/supplies;

(c) the technical nature of the contract and the specific
characteristics including whether ~—the_—sparrticular.
services/works/supplies are being provided in other Member
States or are UK specific? 7;

(a) whether the opportunity is strategic such that a new entrant from
another Member State would pursue the opportunity for strategic
business purposes (e.g. to “establish itself on the market of that
State and to make itself known there with a view to preparing its
future expansion"®); and

(2) whether any interest has been expressed by suppliers from other
Member States (including UK subsidiaries of European
companies) and (in retrospect) whether any complaints have
been made by operators situated in other Member States.°

3. What about low value contracts?

There is a presumption that very low value contracts are unlikely to attract cross
border interest.!° However, it remains possible that cross border interest could
be found in contracts of low value (<£25k), where the other factors support EU
interest.‘ Therefore when placing low value contracts POL must still conduct an
assessment as to whether cross border interest is present. If cross border interest
is present, a procurement process which complies with the Treaty Principles is
required. This will include suitable advertisement of both the contract opportunity
and the contract award.!® Regardless of whether cross border interest is present,
POL must adhere to any internal rules, to the extent applicable.

4 What about light touch regime contracts?

The light-touch regime is a specific set of rules for certain service contracts that
tend to be of lower interest to cross-border competition (e.g. postal services).
There is a presumption that below threshold light touch contracts will not have
cross border interest. Therefore cross border interest would likely only be present
in below threshold light touch regime contracts in exceptional circumstances."

Tab 12 Policies for Approval

If, having assessed the relevant factors, POL remains unsure as to whether there is cross
border interest in a particular opportunity, the "no procurement law risk" option would be
to assume that there is cross border interest.!*

However, the need to rely on the assumption could potentially be reduced where POL is
able to gather additional information from the market. There are various methods to test
the market. The greatest level of certainty could be gained by POL issuing a PIN on the
Official Journal, seeking very general expressions of interest. However, softer testing, for
example by contacting non UK suppliers or hosting an advertised Suppliers’ Day may also
generate some relevant intelligence. POL would of course need to determine whether such
market engagement was otherwise considered appropriate.

FNS - Requirement to adhere to any POL procurement policy (to the extent
applicable)

As at the date on which this guide has been produced, we are advised that POL does not
operate a formal procurement policy. However, to the extent that this is developed in the
future, this should be adhered to for contracts of all values.

FN6 - How to procure in compliance with the Treaty Principles

As above, POL will be required to comply with Treaty Principles if placing below threshold
public services, works, supplies or concessions contract which attract cross border interest.

5 What are the relevant Treaty Principles?

Of particular importance are the principles of equal treatment, proportionality,
non-discrimination on grounds of nationality and transparency."

6. What are the implications for POL's below threshold procurements?

Where the Treaty Principles apply, there must be some form of open competition
for below threshold contracts which complies with the following:

(2) a degree of advertising sufficient to ensure opening-up to
competition; and
(b) impartiality within the procurement procedure.'®

Therefore POL will need to run a fair and open competition. This would include
setting out clear rules and criteria for assessment of responses which are then
subsequently applied and ensuring that bidders are afforded a proportionate time
to respond to any opportunity.”

Below threshold procurements which attract cross border interest cannot lawfully
be made by way of direct awards or by way of closed competitions (i.e. with a pre
identified pool of bidders).

* However, in the event of a challenge, itis forthe challenger to show that cross border interests present, rater than to simply
demonstrate that ts presence cannot be discounted Tecnoedi CostruzioniC-318/15

The Regulations impose certain obligations in respect of below threshold contracts >£25k.
These obligations do not apply where, had the procurement been at or above OJEU
threshold, it would have benefitted from an exemption from the Regulations.1®

1 Requirements to publish contract opportunities on Contracts Finder

POL must publish contract opportunities on Contracts Finder in relation to
opportunities >£25k whenever it advertises the contract opportunity elsewhere
(for example on the POL website or in trade press). "Advertisement" for these
purposes is broadly interpreted but will not apply where POL simply obtains quotes
from one or two selected contractors.!?

The information must be published on Contracts Finder within 24 hrs of publication
elsewhere.

Contracts Finder information must include:

(a) The date and time by which any interested supplier must respond
if it wishes to be considered (which must be a sufficient but not
disproportionate period of time within which to respond).

(b)_ How and to whom a supplier must respond.
(c) Any other requirements for participating in the procurement.

POL must also offer unrestricted and full direct internet access free of charge to
any relevant contract documents?* (unless a relevant reason for not doing so
applies)**.

2. Requirement to publish contract award details

POL is required to publish contract award details in Contracts Finder for contracts
> £25k within a reasonable time of awarding the contract.?2

Contracts Finder information must include:??

(a)__ the name of the contractor;
(b) the date on which the contract was entered into;
(c) the value of the contract;

(a) whether the contractor is a SME”; and

"© Regulation 109(2). See exemptions contained in Regulations 7-17. Importantly, exemption does not appear to include
Regulation 32 situations.

(2) whether the contractor is a VCSE®*.
POL can withhold information where one of the grounds in Regulation 112(2)
applies.
3 Prohibition on separate prequalification stage

POL is prohibited from using a separate prequalification stage for contracts of
£25,000 to £189,329. POL may ask relevant and proportionate "suitability
assessment” questions as part of a one stage process.?”

Potential consequences of a failure to conduct a process:

Scenario 1: No cross border interest, no POL procurement policy, <£25k contract
therefore no Regulations

No procurement law consequences - POL has freedom to award as it considers appropriate
including to make a direct award.

Scenario 2: No cross border interest and no POL procurement policy, 2£25k
contract therefore Regulations apply

Regulations require publication of opportunity and award on Contracts Finder and prohibit
use of separate prequalification stage.

Failure to comply with Regulations - potential judicial review challenge e.g. on the basis
of a breach of a statutory duty (subject to the challenger having sufficient "standing").

Scenario 3: N
procurement pol

cross border interest, but the award is contrary to POL
y (if applicable)

Potential judicial review challenge e.g. based on a breach of a legitimate expectation
(subject to the challenger having sufficient standing)

(Compliance with the Regulations is required for contracts 2£25k - for a failure to comply
see scenario 2.)

Scenario 4: Where there is cross border interest.

A breach of the general treaty principles of non-discrimination, equal treatment,
transparency and proportionality may currently be brought by way of a damages action
on a basis of a breach of a statutory duty or could potentially be pursued by way of judicial
review, subject to the necessary standing

(Compliance with the Regulations is required for contracts 2£25k - for a failure to comply
see scenario 2.)

(Compliance with internal policy is also required - for a failure to comply see scenario 3.)

* For these purposes, "CSE" means a non-governmental organisation that is value-driven and which principally reinvests its
surpluses to further social, environmental orcuttural objectives.

2 This is based on the current threshold for suppliesiservices contracts for sub-central contracting authorties

Consequences of Brexit

Under the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, at the end of the Transition Period on
31 December 2020, breaches of the general treaty principles will no longer give rise to
such a claim,

There is a transitional provision (which has not yet been commenced) within the 2018 Act
to the effect that any actions for a breach that took place prior to the 31 December 2020
may still be brought until 31 December 2023. As such, if a cause of action for a breach of
a general treaty principle arises during the Transition Period, it is likely that there will
remain a period within which a challenger could raise an action.

approval commences

1.1. Identifying the need for an exception

If a business unit wants to extend a contract, or enter into a new contract, and Procurement advise
that doing this will create a compliance breach of any value over £25k, then the contract owner or
prospective contract-owner must complete the Procurement Risk Exception Form [PREN]. This, along
with any supporting documentation requires Board level approval.

1.2. Complete the Procurement Risk Exception Note

The contract owner (or prospective contract owner) should complete all three sections of the PREN.

1.3. Review & Approval of the Procurement Risk Exception Note

On completion submit the form to Procurement for review, they will assure whether the form has
sufficient detail included. The PREN should then be passed to the accountable GE Member (or delegate
GE-1) for the area raising the risk and the Legal team for review and preparation of a Legal Risk Note.

On completion of all reviews, Procurement will submit the PREN alongside any additional information
to GE and then the Board for approval.

Where delegated authority requires additional approvals, an accountable owner must be identified for
on-going monitoring & closure of the exception. This must be noted on the PREN form.

1.4. Recording & Monitoring of PREN

The approved PREN must be recorded on the Procurement PCR Risk Register (PCRRR) and where
material [>£189k over term of agreement], the local Business Risk Register in the form of an Open
Risk to ensure the business area and the Risk Business Partner has full visibility of the exposure faced.

Based on the level of risk exposure the frequency of review will be assigned by Enterprise Risk. At the
frequency defined, the Business Owner of the PREN should schedule review sessions with the
accountable owner (GE Member), Procurement, Risk Business Partner and action owners of the PREN.
This ensure progress is reviewed and any material changes which may affect the duration or actions
in flight are given appropriate oversight and approval. Based on this review the local risk register and
central exception tracker will be updated. Five working days prior to the Risk Exception End Date, a
final review session should be held. This review will determine whether the PREN can be closed or
whether an extension is required. If extending the PREN it will require re-approval by all original
approvers including Board. A report of all outstanding exceptions is provided to the Risk & Compliance
Committee at a 2 monthly frequency. Accountable GE/RCC members may be required to provide an
update.

1.5. PREN & REN Closure

When the risk has been remediated either by corrective action or expiry of a statutory period, the
exception can be closed. The closure rationale & supporting evidence including any updated
documents (e.g. contracts etc.) must be agreed with the accountable owner and provided to the
relevant Business Risk Partner within the Enterprise risk team (with evidence of owner agreement
supplied). On receipt they will review all evidence, raise any queries as necessary and once satisfied
close the risk. On closure they will notify all relevant parties.

1. Overview

1.1. Introduction by the Process Owner

This Purchasing Process sets out the processes through which, the organisation acquires
the goods and services it needs, using contracted suppliers and agreements, with defined
and controlled purchasing channels from request through to payment.

1.2. Purpose

The purpose of this process is to ensure that the purchasing process for goods and services
required for Post Office daily operations is done in a compliant, timely and efficient manner
once an approved contract has been entered into with a third party, and the supplier
successfully onboarded onto the Post Office purchasing system. The process provides
guidelines and principles that Post Office employees will follow in the end to end purchasing
process. At the same time it is an essential framework for the current and future business
relationship with our suppliers.

It is one of a set of processes and policies which provide a clear risk and governance
framework and an effective system of internal control for the management of risk across
the Post Office. Compliance with these policies supports the Post Office in meeting its
business objectives and to balance the needs of shareholders, employees and other
stakeholders.

This Process will provide:

« Guidance on how goods and services must be purchased by Post Office employees.

« Overview of the purchasing channels, processes, when to use them, and what are
acceptable and unacceptable purchases

« Corporate card maintenance and security

e Clarity on the roles and responsibilities for purchasing

« Misuse and abuse of corporate purchase cards

« Clarity in our approach to compliance by linking the Post Office Purchasing Process
into the Procurement Policy

This process does not cover corporate policy on Travel and Subsistence, Procurement,
Supplier Onboarding or Contract Management.

1.3. Core Principles
Purchasing shall be driven by the following Guiding Principles in all Purchasing activities:

Purchasing Principles

. Achieve sustained value by progressively managing Post Office expenditure,
maximising value and seeking continuous improvement and innovation for the Post
Office.

. Ensure the risk to Post Office is minimised by having contracts and commercial
arrangements in place to ensure delivery of goods and services to agreed
requirements

. Enable continuous improvement and compliance from our the relationships with
suppliers.

. To ensure that only goods and services that are receipted are paid for and that
waste and unnecessary expenditure is reduced; and to

. Ensure suppliers are paid within 30 days on undisputed invoices in accordance with

Purchase Order Core Principles

Post Office operates a 3 Way Match policy to auto release payment:
© Purchase Order [PO] + Goods Received Note + Invoice

« Correct sequence needs to be followed for Manual PR:

to fixed
thresholds
and approved
by Delegated
Authority

o Requisition - Purchase Order - Goods - Received - Invoice Payment
« A Supplier must have been through the onboarding due diligence system process
to be set up on the Purchasing tool for use. This includes separate authorisations
from the Procurement and Master Data teams and an independent verification of

bank details from Treasury.

«Only the OTV and Corporate card channels allow for the use of suppliers who have

not been through due diligence.

« No PO, No Pay policy enlists suppliers in compliance with the Post Office Policy by

requesting a PO before goods or services are ordered.

Exceptions to No PO No Pay are made for utilities, rates and other taxes were the
PO is raised retrospectively and are listed in section 1.7.2.1.

For NPIR and OTV channels a 2 Way match process applies to release payment:
Authorisation + Invoice

The Sarbanes-Oxley segregation of duties principle applies to separate the
Requisitioner, Approver and Payer, thus protecting Post Office against errors,
malicious intent and fraud.

Procurement Operations are accountable for all Catalogue content

Procurement Category Manager approval is required to ensure that the correct
supplier is used and a Contract and CAF is in place for each purchase order to
ensure PCR compliance.

Financial approval is required to ensure that budget is available to make an
expenditure commitment.

Corporate Card Spend Core Principles

eee eee

Cards must be used for Business purposes only.

Goods and Services should be delivered to a Post Office business office address.
The card is non-transferable.

The card and PIN must be kept safe at all times.

The card shall not be used for cash withdrawals.

Employees must be authorised by their Finance Business Partner and Budget Holder
before becoming a card holder.

Transaction and monthly credit limits shall be established for each card issued.
Budget holders may change the card limit by applying for an increase or decrease
via the CPC Coordinator.

The Card may not be used for travel related expenses (except for exceptions listed
in 1.7.3.5) where Post Office mandates the use of the Travel Management Company
for hotels, flights, rail travel and events booking. This is set out in further detail in
1.7.3.6.

Use of the Card for any purpose which is not in accordance with company policy
will result in disciplinary action.

Accounts Payable Principles

Invoice should be sent directly by the supplier to Accounts Payable and not via an
internal colleague - internal colleagues can be cc’d in if required

Invoices must be sent containing a relevant Purchase Order number and relevant
line number - as stated on the Purchase order

Invoices should be submitted in a PDF format and in a consistent layout to enable
data capture to be performed

LBD [leaving the business with dignity] and compensation invoice payments must
be fully approved, containing GL and cost centre prior to submission to Accounts
Payable

Invoices can be blocked for payment if in dispute

Invoices in dispute must be reported to Accounts Payable and the Contract
Manager, giving reason for dispute, supplier contact name and estimated date for
resolution.

Only fully authorised invoices will be paid, and will be paid in line with agreed
payment terms - any terms other than 30 days need Finance Director

Suppliers will be paid within 30 days of receipt of undisputed invoice,

Suppliers will be paid by Bacs transfer. Any exception to this requires justification
by means of business benefit.

« Any exceptional requests for payment via CHAPS will require a business benefit
along with a 24 hours’ notice to meet treasury timescales

« Payment runs are completed daily Monday to Friday, with exception of UK bank
holidays

1.4. Application

This Process is applicable to all areas within the Post Office and defines the minimum
standards to control financial loss, customer impact, regulatory breaches and reputational
damage in line with the Post Office’s Risk Appetite which is periodically reviewed by the
Board.

In exceptional circumstances, where the purchasing activity sits outside of the Post Office’s
accepted Risk Appetite, a Risk Exception can be granted. For further information in relation
to the risk exception process please contact the Risk & Assurance team -
https://poluk.sharepoint.com/sites/Risks

For definitions please see section 3.1.

1.5. The Risk

The Purchasing Process is designed to establish best practice and mitigate the risk . All
purchasing activities shall adhere to the Post Office Purchasing Process. Procurement shall
ensure that risk management is appropriately applied at all stages of procurement
activities. Guidance shall be made available to enable the Procurement team to employ
Post Offices risk management principles.

Purchasing activities following best practise shall be carried out in a manner that will
enhance Post Offices capability to avoid waste and inefficiency, prevent fraud and
unauthorised expensiture, and facilitiate the processing of supplier invoices in accordance
with our payment terms.

1.6. Legislation

The Post Office seeks to comply with all relevant UK legal and regulatory requirements
including (but not limited to):

Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982

The Reporting on Payment Practices and Performance Regulations 2017
Public Contract Regulation 2015

Competition Act 1998

Concession Contracts Regulation 2016

1.7. Purchasing Channels Guidance

1.7.1 Catalogue Summary

A Catalogue is pre-agreed list of prices for goods or services with our preferred suppliers.
The use of a catalogue to create a requisition is therefore automatically compliant under
contract. Where the catalogue is hosted on the supplier website (Punch-Out), an additional
check is used by Procurement to ensure that the products selected are part of the agreed
list and the pricing is accurate. In all other respects the process is the same as 1.7.2.

183 of 323

POL-BSFF-0228299 0182
1.7.2 Manual Purchase Order Summary

A manual order is created by first raising a Purchase Requisition containing all the
information required for the order including the name of the supplier and the accounting
codes for the budget, nominal codes and tax. Pre-configured Web3 forms are available to
guide the addition of essential information. Notes and attachments can be added.

The Requisition is sent for approval through the following routes:

«Buyer approval: the requisition will be routed to a buyer in Procurement if it is an
incomplete non-category item, or the Requisitioner has included a buyer note.

e¢ Budget approval: Web3 will then automatically check if there is enough budget
against a code to proceed.

« User spend approval: Web3 will then check if there is any additional approval
steps required specifically created for the user that has raised it.

« Product category approval: to verify if the chosen supplier is correct and a valid
Contract is in place.

« Project spend/BAU spend approval: the relevant financial approver in projects or
BAU teams (POL and POI) depending on the budget or cost centre concerned.

Once a Purchase Requisition is approved, it is automatically converted to a Purchase order.
This creates a financial commitment in the CFS system and the order is sent to the
supplier.

A Goods Receipt must be created once the goods or services have been delivered, to
confirm acceptance and create an accrual in the CFS system.

The Web3 purchasing process works on the principle of a 3 way match of Purchase Order,
Receipt and Invoice. The only exceptions to this would be those listed in 1.7.2.1, and in
1.7.4 and 1.7.5.

1.7.2.1 Exception to No PO No Pay

We have a “No purchase order, no payment” Policy with suppliers to ensure that we have
an efficient and controlled payment process. A supplier should be provided with a valid
purchase order (PO) number which must be quoted on all supplier invoices.

Suppliers are told to consider any request for goods or services without a PO as invalid as
it may have been requested without company authorisation. Suppliers are also informed
that any invoice that is submitted without a valid PO number will be returned, or held
pending investigation and coding, which could delay processing and payment.

The only permissible exceptions to this rule are:

«Charitable donations

« General leases, which are subject to Direct Debits or standing orders (e.g.
vehicle, and machinery)

« LBD Payments on behalf of individuals, made under the Leaving the Business with
Dignity programme (e.g. legal fees and training grants)

« Non-procurement related payments to (or on behalf of) Public Bodies, made
under legislative (or similar) obligations

« Utilities - electricity, gas, water, rates etc.

« Compensation payments

1.7.2.2 Approval and Delegation

Financial approval rules, levels and thresholds are set by the Financial Leadership Team
and have been designed in such a way to prevent self-approval.

INTERNAL Page 7 of 20 @BCL@6C10BE51.1

POL00401629
POL00401629

POL-BSFF-0228299_ 0183
Only users allocated the licenced role of an approver can approve, in addition they must
also be added to an approval table or be nominated as a delegate to actually approve a
requisition.

Approvers can delegate their approval by using an out of office functionality to set
delegation over a defined period, however they may only delegate to another Web3 user
who has been given a system role as an approval.

Web3 also has the functionality to add an additional approver to the workflow if there are
specific requirements against an individual, i.e. if the Requisitioner is a non-Post Office
employee/ contractor.

1.7.3 Corporate Card Process Summary

The card process does not require competitive quotations but there is an expectation that
the cardholder will seek the best price and value for the Post Office. Since all purchases
must be under the relevant monthly limit set for the card, where the requirements change
to regular use the requirement shall be referred to Procurement to review alternative
supply options. For the avoidance of doubt regular use would be a recurring annual cost
of more than £5,000 either as a one off payment or a series of small recurring payments
from one or more card holder.

1.7.3.1 Card Maintenance

Name changes, card replacements, cancellations or reinstatements, are maintained by the
CPC Coordinator with approvals and verification from the relevant Financial Director. Cost
centre and department changes are made in coordination with Accounts Payable to enable the
automated invoicing of card statements.

1.7.3.2 Card Security

Cards, PINs and accounts shall be issued to individual employees on the basis that they
take adequate responsibility for the security of the cards, never display or give their card
number or PIN to anyone for the purpose of allowing anyone else to place an order with
the card. Sharing card details represents a fraudulent breach of contract with our card
provider and a breach of GDPR. The Post Office does not tolerate fraud under any
circumstances. The cardholder may be subject to investigation under the formal HR
disciplinary procedure.

If a card is lost or stolen the cardholder is responsible for informing the card provider
immediately and updating the CPC Coordinator at the first available opportunity.

1.7.3.3 Card Spending Limits

The cardholder transaction limit for monthly expenditure is set at £1000 on issue. Any
increase to these limits shall be considered separately from the card holder application,
except where this is a temporarily increased limit for an ad-hoc purchase. Transaction
limits over £1000 must be approved by the Procurement Director and the accountable GE
Member.

All transactions made on the card are retrospectively entered into the Selenity expenses
system to enable the cardholder to attach receipts or other supporting evidence.
Transactions are reviewed and approved retrospectively within Selenity by the
cardholder's line manager.

1.7.3.4 Card Control

s for Approval

Cards will be assigned to one cost centre only and all purchases will be against that cost
centre. The number of cards per cost centre will be at the discretion of the Finance Director.
Cards shall not be used for the purposes of withdrawing cash and purchases shall not be
split resulting in a number of transactions below the threshold; such transactions will be
identifiable via the monthly MI reports.

The exception to this will be a card held centrally by Procurement to facilitate ad hoc
purchases for departments without a CPC card, or for occasional purchases where payment
can only be made via a credit card. An example of this is Software where company policy
ordinarily precludes purchasing software outside of the CFS system. The CPC Procurement
cardholder must hold email authorisation from both the Procurement Director, the Budget
Holder and the IT Software Vendor Manager for the purchase and ensure that the costs
are cross-charged appropriately.

1.7.3.5) Card Acceptable Purchases

Acceptable purchases are linked to the specific business role of the cardholder and are
those purchases that cannot be managed by any other method, these could include:

e Emergency Vehicle Spares

« Emergency Burglary and Damage purchases

« Emergency Hostages Costs

Toll Charges

Ferry costs for Supply Chain

SIA costs e.g. licences

Hire fees (e.g. costumes etc. for Public Relations purposes)

«Ad hoc Courier services

e External Hospitality / Entertainment (In line with the gifts and hospitality process
published on the Post Office Intranet)

* Conference/Meeting less than <£500

Also acceptable are non IT related subscriptions, non-operational licences (such as TV
licenses for our buildings) and corporate memberships (like CIPS, CIPD etc.), as opposed
to individual memberships (one per person) that should be reclaimed via the expenses
system.

L736 Card Unacceptable Purchases

Corporate Purchasing Cards must not be used for Goods and Services where a Post Office
Contract exists, for Travel & Subsistence i.e. Train Tickets, Flights, Meals, Snacks, Petrol
or Overnight Accommodation, and any of the following:

« Items exceeding the limit agreed by Budget Holder,
« Capital equipment

1.7.3.7 Misuse or Abuse of Cards

Where Cards have been used for purposes which are not in accordance with company
policy, the cardholder will be subject to investigation under the formal disciplinary
procedure.

Post Office may investigate any fraudulent use of the Purchasing Card and where
investigations uphold fraudulent use; Post Office will treat this as a serious disciplinary
offence, and proceed under the conduct code. Where fraudulent use of the card by the
cardholder, or someone the cardholder has knowingly allowed to fraudulently use the card
is detected, the card will be cancelled immediately and necessary measures will be taken.
Fraudulent use will be treated as gross misconduct and may result in summary dismissal.

Where a cardholder is found responsible for, or is party to the fraudulent use of the CPC,
they will be required to repay the Business for any expenditure incurred. Post Office shall
be entitled to recover the principle sum by way of a single deduction or a series of
deductions from the cardholder's pay, including pay in lieu of notice or any other payment
due on the termination of the employment.

Post Office may withdraw the cardholder’s permission to use a card, at any time, whereby
the card must be destroyed immediately.

1.7.4 Automated Invoicing Summary

The Automated invoicing process enables the bulk loading of consolidated invoicing from
suppliers where either the purchasing activity and authorisation for expenditure takes
place on a separate supplier hosted system (such as Travel, Fleet Repairs and Temporary
Labour) or as part of another mechanism (Corporate purchase Card) and where the
quantity and frequency of transactions is not suitable for a 3 way match.

The list of suppliers eligible for NPIR is restricted and any changes must be approved with
Accounts Payable. Supplier list currently comprises of Intelligent Resource, Manpower,
Brook Street, Capita, Caulders, Kinto (Inchape), Barclays, Leaseplan, and Rivus.

NPIR involves loading of a pre-approved multi line invoice into the CFS system which then
automatically creates a matching PO to enable payment.

1.7.5 OTV Summary

One Time Vendor is used for exceptional payments as per 1.7.2.1 and is an exception to
No PO NO PAY. All Leaving the Business with Dignity related invoices must be received
following relevant checks in HR, and are coded to the correct GL and budget code. This
process is subject to manual financial controls with the Accounts Payable team.

2. Risk Appetite and Minimum Control
Standards

2,1. Risk Appetite

Risk Appetite is the extent to which the Post Office will accept that a risk might happen
in pursuit of day to day businesses transactions. It therefore defines the boundaries of
activity and levels of exposure that the Post Office is willing and able to tolerate.

The Post Office takes its legal and regulatory responsibilities seriously and consequently
has:

« Tolerant risk appetite for Legal and Regulatory risk in those limited circumstances
where there are significant conflicting imperatives between conformance and
commercial practicality

e  Averse risk appetite for litigation in relation to high profile cases/issues
«  Averse risk appetite for ligation in relation to Financial Services matters

e  Averse risk appetite for not complying with law and regulations or deviation from
business’ conduct standards for financial crime to occur within any part of the Group

« Averse Risk Appetite in relation to unethical behaviour by our staff.

The Post Office acknowledges however that in certain scenarios even after extensive
controls have been implemented a product or transaction may still sit outside the agreed
Risk Appetite. In this situation, a risk exception waiver will be required.

2.2. Policy Framework

Post Office has established a Procurement Policy and set of supporting processes which
are subject to annual review. These are designed to ensure compliance with best practise
while achieving value for money,combating waste and inefficiency, and complying with
regulations.

The Purchasing Process is a key process under the Procurement Policy framework and
should be considered and read in conjunction with the overarching Finance Policies,
Delegation of Authority Policy and the Code of Conduct where relevant.

2.3. Who must comply?

This process applies to all employees who purchase from suppliers, this includes the
approval of transactions and the processing of payments to suppliers. Compliance with
this process is mandatory for all business units within POL and POMS.

In the case of agencies and consultancies, all contracted personnel working on behalf of
POL shall be made aware of this process and shall comply with all procurement procedures
listed within the Procurement department guidance.

All employees who procure from suppliers should work to our values Care, Challenge and

Commit and our standards set out in the Code of Business Standards and the other POL
policies listed in 4.1. All staff working on behalf of POL should not enter into supplier

selection, discussions with 3rd party, commitment to spend, material contractual changes
or any procurement exercise without the involvement of the procurement team.

This process does not apply directly to outsourced service providers or to suppliers;
however, by making sure that suppliers comply with our Supplier Code of Conduct it does
seek to ensure our outsourced service providers and suppliers must: support the
governance of POL; mitigate the risks faced by POL; and support the quality of service we
provide to our customers, our policies and other legal requirements (including finance,
health and safety, human rights and labour standards, and employment laws);

Where non-compliance is identified the matter must be referred to the Director of Risk,
Compliance Director and the Procurement and Finance Directors. Any investigations will
be carried out in accordance with the Investigations Policy. Where is it identified that that
an instance of non-compliance is caused through wilful disregard or negligence, this will
be treated as a disciplinary offence.

2.5. Minimum Control Standards

POL00401629
POL00401629

A minimum control standard is an activity which must be in place in order to manage the risks so they remain within the defined Risk
Appetite statements. There must be mechanisms in place within each business unit to demonstrate compliance. The minimum control
standards can cover a range of control types, i.e. directive, detective, corrective and preventive which are required to ensure risks are
managed to an acceptable level and within the defined Risk Appetite.

The table below sets out the relationships between identified risk and the required minimum control standards in consideration of the stated
risk appetite. The subsequent pages define the terms used in greater detail:

2. Asummary that identifies the changes and updates to the policies and statements have
been added below:

Contract Execution Policy: Amendments made to the following Paragraphs -
o Para 1.5:

Amended to streamline and clarify acceptable methods of execution in table format which
is more user friendly.

Amended to include process for urgent execution using scanned signatures if permitted by
the Company Secretariat to enable swift execution when required and must be permitted
by the Company Secretary (control advised by Risk). This situation has arisen when
executing contracts and the change makes it easier for the Company Secretariat and the
business to ensure commercial transactions can be done quickly. Legal (Nick Baldock)
have confirmed that this process is acceptable as set out in the policy.

o Para 1.5.3:

Amended to permit execution of deeds via electronic signature. During COVID-19, it was
difficult and cumbersome to execute under seal or by wet signature and a risk exception
had to be agreed. Update guidance from the Law Society confirms deeds may be signed
electronically and this has therefore been reflected in the policy. Legal (Nick Baldock) have
reviewed this change and approved.

o Para 1.6&1.7:

Amended to be clearer on the Exceptions and Breaches process for all Group Companies.
The previous policy did not address the subsidiary risk exception process. This has been
rectified. Having had the policy in operation for a year, it became apparent that
operationally the process for recording breaches was not optimal (when discussed with
Risk (Sukh Giller)). This has therefore been updated to ensure it is clear to ensure
adherence.

o Para 2.2:

Amended the Policy Framework to reflect the current policies applicable to the Group,
following consultation with Reena Chohan (People and Policy Compliance Manager) and
other relevant policies which had not previously been mentioned (Procurement Policy,
Contract Management Framework and the Risk Management Framework).

o Para 2.4:

Minor amendments to the language used to ensure that it is truly applicable to the Group*
and its new Governance Framework (for example, eCAF is only applicable to Post Office
Limited, not its subsidiaries and the new Governance Framework uses the term “spend
approval limits” instead of “delegated authorities”). Other amendments reflect the change
in the team structure (Retail — Retail & Franchise Network) and Franchise agreements
should instead be Network agreements as per para 6.2.1.

o Para 5.1:

Minor amendments to job titles and language to reflect changes in organisational
structure and revised language of the Governance Framework.

Tab 12 s for Approval
o Para 7.2:
Amendment to show the ARC as the oversight committee for the policy. It was not initially
intended that this policy be approved by the ARC as it is an operational policy, however it
was included in the Key Policy List and therefore approval is now required (the ARC
approved the policy in September 2019). The ARC Chair has confirmed this policy should
be approved by the ARC on this occasion.
o Para 5/6:
Moving of section 6 (Appendix referring to the Contract Approval Process) into section 5
(Governance) at the request of the ARC Chair.
e  *This policy is intended to be adopted by all Group Companies, including Payzone Bill Payments
Limited. The policy has been discussed with their Risk team.
Policy Compliance View
The Annual Review of the Policy conducted by the Policy Owner suggests that the Policy demonstrates conformance
for each Minimum Control Standard through the appropriate governance structure in place for the execution of
contracts within the Group. There are clear procedures and guidance in place to ensure risk is mitigated and that the
group does not enter contracts without proper scrutiny which could lead the Group to potential financial losses. The
Policy Owner has demonstrated how the minimum control standards stated within the Policy are being met in pursuit
of day to day business.
Vulnerable Customer Policy: The annual update includes minor tidying up and some updates
to the legislative references. The external accessibility experts Kate Nash Associates/Purple
Space have reviewed the latest policy and confirmed that it is up to date and appropriate.
Policy Compliance view
It is useful to have endorsement from third party experts on the policy content, we have also had overall positive
inspections from Citizen’s Advice Bureau teams on branch accessibility. However, we could face challenges on digital
accessibility and from recent FCA and Ofcom rules that continually ‘raise the bar’ on expectations. So continued focus
is required in this area
Physical Security Policy: The annual review update includes minor changes such as updates to
the How to Raise a Concern Section and minor tidying up of the Policy.
The Physical Security Policy Suite is one of a set of sub-policies set out below, this being the
overarching policy:
CCTV Deployment Policy and Code of Practice
Lone Worker Policy
Tiger Kidnap or Hostage Policy

day to day business and weather the risks around Physical Security are in line with the appropriate governance

structure of the Group.

Compliance will look to conduct a more in-depth assurance review and sample test the Physical Security Policy Suite
on a risk basis to review the policy standard and policy compliance in Q3.

The Policy is one of a set of security policies for the Group and therefore the minimum control standards stated within
the policy form a part of wider key policies. The assurance will test how the Physical Security Policy is performing
against the other subset of policies it belongs to and how effective the minimum operating standards relating to the
management of our physical security risks are in pursuit of managing our business.

HMRC Fit and Proper Standards Policy: Amended following business structure changes, role
titles and changes to process/ownership following completion of agent F&P project:

e Agent definition updated to reflect currently approved definition in AML/CTF policy

« Amendments for direct employees to reflect that Success Factors now includes a
mandatory field to show whether a role is subject to HMRC F&P

e Removed requirement for direct employees transferring to a F&P role to be re-vetted
as all individuals are vetted on employment and undertake annual re-declaration as
there is on-going performance management and Business Code of Conduct, plus HMRC
undertake some checks as part of the F&P process

e Updated references to Declarations Oversight Committee as this only covers agent F&P.

e Updated whistleblowing contact details

¢ All role titles amended to reflect current structure and added roles of Head of Risk &
Branch Standards and SmartID Product Owner as this area is now responsible for the
Agent F&P Team (agent F&P declarations and reporting)

e Complete re-write of training matrix with input from impacted teams

Policy Compliance View

The project to deliver the system and processes for agent F&P declarations, reporting and governance was delivered
in July 2020, and the minimum control standards in the policy standard have operated sub-optimally up to this point.
For direct employees, records had not always been up to date, but in the last 6 months work has been undertaken
with the Head of HR Organisation Effectiveness and Success Factors to bring all records up to date and implement
controls to prevent issues.

Given the gaps previously identified assurance will take form over the next 12 months to ensure the minimum control
standards in the revised policy standard will be brought into scope for quarterly checking by the Financial Crime team
and the People & Policy Compliance Manager.

Assurance

Compliance have now introduced an assurance process for future policy submissions and re-
review by requiring policy owners to attest that the minimum control standards stated within
the policy are being met and can be demonstrated. (refer to appendix A). The Policy Approval
Form asks Policy Owners to complete a section on Policy Performance where they have to
confirm that each minimum control standard stated within the policy is being met and can be
evidenced. Compliance will give an initial view on this attestation within the template.

As this process now moves towards BAU from Q3 we would propose to do a more in-depth

We are currently in the process of updating the Key Policies Intranet Page which we propose
to go live in Q3. The page will reflect the following:

« A policy summary of each key policy;

e Policy cycle document to show when policies were last reviewed and are due for their
next review;

« Policy Approval Form;

e All Group Key Policies.

Progress

Good progress has been made in working with Company Secretariat in re-establishing the key
policy list for appropriate review and regular sign off as well as identifying any gaps, however,
there needs to be increased focus on ensuring policies are reviewed in accordance with the
policy review cycle as we still have some gaps where policies are still out of date and do not
reflect current working practices. (refer to appendix C which highlights red flags on the policies
which have been out of scope for some time now).

Conclusion

We continue to work with Policy Owners and Company Secretariat to ensure we maintain our
policy governance responsibilities. This is a key part of the wider Post Office controls work
that is covered in the main paper.

Minimum control standards and evidencing compliance

Below is an example of how a control standard can be operated as working.
Policy AML CTF
Risk area

Through inadequate training, staff allow money laundering or terrorist financing to take
place, resulting in reputation damage and regulatory fines.

Preventative Control:

Post Office has a Group wide training programme to ensure that all customer facing staff,
back office staff and contractors receive adequate training tailored to business risk areas.

Comment on the control

This control can be evidenced as working. An annual AML training and test is conducted. We
can evidence both through Success Factors and Smart ID controls in the Network that this
training and test is undertaken. There are also a wide variety of communications on this area
that can be evidenced to raise awareness. This does raise AML awareness as evidenced
through widespread knowledge of grapevine and the SAR process/submissions we receive.

The purpose of the Policy Monitoring Report is to understand, test and gain assurance that
the Policies and Procedures Post Office Limited have in place are working and are fit for
purpose.

Each Policy has been established to set the minimum operating standards, which provides a
clear risk and governance framework and an effective system of internal controls for the
management of risks across the Group.

Compliance with all policies supports the Group in meeting its business objectives and to
balance the needs of shareholders, employees and other stakeholders.

The below table sets out the Residual Risk Score and Rating that will apply upon review of
each key policy to determine how effective the policy is, any control weaknesses or gaps
and whether the policy needs enhancements/improvements.

Post Office Limited - Risk and Compliance Committee-10/09/20 209 of 323

POL-BSFF-0228299 0208
POL00401629
POL00401629

To establish whether the customer communications and financial promotions Policy and the
processes held within the policy are being adhered to by all employees and the
effectiveness of the policy is being implemented across the group.

The customer communications policy and financial promotions policy requires appropriate
care to be taken when communicating with customers, complying with the FCA principles
for Business, particularly Principle 7 which outlines communications with customers — “firms
must pay due regard to the information needs of their customers, and communicate
information to them in a way which is clear, fair and not misleading.”

All communications must be:

- Balanced;

- Balanced between risks and benefits;

- Accurate;

- Consistent;

- Not make untrue or misleading claims;

- Use appropriate language;

- Not seek to exclude, or restrict any duty or liability the Group may have to the
customer;

- Not disguise, omit, diminish or obscure important information, statements or
warnings;

There are two subsets from the FCA Handbook that are applicable and subjected to the
customer communications and financial promotions policy:

a. Customer Lending — which is subject to the FCA’s conduct of Business
Source Book “COBS” and the Consumer Credit Sourcebook “CONC” being
applied to customer communications and financial promotions.

b. Customer Savings — which is subject to the FCA’s Banking Conduct of
Business Sourcebook “BCOBS”

An initial review of the customer communications and financial promotions policy will be
conducted in July 2020 with a view to review annually, depending on the outcome of this
review.

3. Methodology

The review consisted of the following:

POL-BSFF-0228299_ 0209
POL00401629
POL00401629

- Review of the customer communications and financial promotions Policy

- Asample check of two pieces of customer communications

- Asample check of two pieces of financial promotions which have been signed off

- Asample check of two areas of the policy to see if they are working in practice and
that the processes written within them are being followed and adhered to within the
business and applied to everyday work ethics.

4. Source of Information/References

The source of the information will come from:

- Marketing of our products and services
- Website or communications gone out to customers
- Customer communications and financial promotions policy

5. . Findings

The review compromised of monitoring two signed off customer communications, two
signed of marketing campaigns and two areas of the customer communications and
financial promotions policy. In particular paying focus to weather employees were following
current guidelines set out in the policy when writing or communicating with customers,
following regulation and legislation when creating marketing material around our products
and services and two areas of the minimum control standards which are in place to ensure
and manage the risks so they remain within the defined Risk Appetite statements.

Whilst the above were followed and compliant as per the policy guidelines and standards
there were other gaps identified within the policy such as, no documented process on how
financial promotions are currently being approved and logged. At present a financial
promotion has to go through several stages between the compliance team and other areas
of the business before it gets approved, the policy itself needs enhancements in terms of
adding in a structure of the approval process, ownership and record keeping of all
approvals and declines to demonstrate a clear audit trail and to ensure all approved
customer communications and marketing campaigns are within the defined risk appetite
and are in line with current FCA and advertising standard agency regulations.

The approval log that is currently in place is not being utilised fully and needs enhancing to
demonstrate that the appropriate level of checks are being done before final sign off and
approval.

6. Recommendations

Whist the policy is effective and fit for purpose, it is recommended that the policy is
enhanced and improved to demonstrate a clear sign off and ownership process is defined
within the policy and sets out a structure on keeping a record of all approved and declined

241 of 323

POL-BSFF-0228299_ 0210
POL00401629
POL00401629

customer communications and financial promotions to ensure that there is a clear audit trail
of how they are being approved by the business.

7. Rating / Residual Risk Score

- Rating — Satisfactory, room for improvement
- Residual Risk Score - Low

Managers Response

It is clear that there is no sufficient process defined within the policy for documenting sign
off for customer communications and financial promotions as well as where the ownership
of this lies. The policy also does not demonstrate a process flow or guidance notes on how
to manage and keep records/logs of approved of declined communications and financial
promotions for audit purposes and to ensure our risk appetite is being met in accordance
with regulation and our defined minimum control standards.

The current log is not being fully utilised and needs improvements to demonstrate the
appropriate level of checks are being carried out before final sign off and approval.

It is evident that improvements/enhancements need to be made to the policy to ensure
Post Office can demonstrate that they are being compliant on customer communications
and financial promotions in accordance with regulation and meeting the FCA objective of
“clear, fair and not misleading”

We will review what tools are available to make the relevant changes and enhancements to
the policy and report back by September 2020.

9. Agreed actions to be taken

1. Contract Execution Policy

Ben Foat Rebecca September
Whibley 2019

1.1Purpose and Content of the Policy

The Policy has been established to set out the requirements for execution of contracts in
the Group. Such documents should not be executed without the appropriate governance
procedures being followed (where applicable), the Policy outlines that in most instances
this will be by the completion of the Contract Approval Process and stipulates that no
individual should sign a contract who is not an authorised signatory, the Company
Secretariat retain a list of authorised signatories.

The Board of each Group Company has authorised specified individuals and/or roles
(known as “authorised signatories”) to sign contracts on behalf of the respective
company. Only these individuals are permitted to sign contracts on behalf of the
company. If an unauthorised signatory signs a contract, this must be recorded as a
breach of process on the respective company’s risk register.

The Policy sets out the following appropriate methods of execution of contracts by
authorised signatories within the Group and the requirements and controls for each
method.

e Wet Signatures - A wet signature is a handwritten signature by the individual on
a hard copy contract

« Electronic Signatures - An electronic signature is “data in electronic form which is
attached to or logically associated with other data in electronic form and which is
used by the signatory to sign”

« Execution of Deeds - Deeds require a particular method of execution in order to
be valid. The Company Secretariat is responsible for the execution of deeds and
no deeds should be signed without first consulting the Company Secretariat.

1.2Key definition

An executed contract is a legal document that has been signed off by the people
necessary for it to become effective and therefore the “Contract Execution” is the
process of signing an agreed contract, after which its terms become binding on the
parties to the contract”.

1.3Who Must Comply

All Post Office employees and applies wherever in the world the Group’s business is
undertaken. All external parties who do business with the Group, including consultants,
suppliers and business and franchise partners, will be required to agree contractually to
this policy or with their own equivalent policy.

1.4Key Laws and Regulations

The Group seeks to comply with all relevant UK legislation and regulatory requirements,
including but not limited to:

I, Common law
IL. Companies Act 2006, specifically ss. 43 - 44

1.5Risk Appetite and Minimum Control Standards

The Group is exposed to a number of risks relating to Contract Execution and the Risk
Appetite is the extent to which the Group will accept that a risk might happen in pursuit
of day to day business transactions. It therefore defines the boundaries of activity and
levels of exposure that the Group are willing and able to tolerate.

The Group have an Averse risk appetite towards Contract Execution.

The policy outlines minimum control standards across 4 areas of risk. Below is an example of the
relationships between the risk area and the required minimum control standards to meet the
stated risk appetite:

2° If the counterparty cannot execute in this way, execution may be by a director and witness. The witness must
be physically present when the director signs the deed.

4 Director for the purposes of this policy means statutory director and does not include colleagues whose job
title is director.

* This method of signature is only acceptable where all other methods of signature are not possible.

1.6. Exceptions

In the ordinary course of events standard business procedures should be followed to
ensure that Post Office stays within its defined risk appetite. However, there are situations
where business requirements make it necessary to depart from approved policy and take
an informed decision to operate outside risk appetite. In these exceptional circumstances,
a ‘risk exception’ can be granted subject to the risk exception process. For more
information please contact the Enterprise Risk team for Post Office Limited or the relevant
Risk Team for Payzone Bill Payments LimitedPost Office Insurance does not permit
exceptions to its approved policies.

1.7. Breaches

A breach of this policy would include:

- where a contract has been signed by an unauthorised signatory from the relevant
Group Company;

- where a contract has been signed without first completing the Contract Approval
Process (where required); or

- where a contract is signed using the incorrect method of execution as detailed in
this policy.

In the event there is a breach of this policy, the incident must be recorded on the
respective company’s breach register. Where possible, the breach must be remediated
and the remediation recorded (for example, the contract is signed again by an authorised
signatory and/or by the correct execution method and the previous copy is disregarded).
Where the breach cannot be remediated (usually due to the passage of time), the breach
must be recorded on the respective company’s risk register. Where a breach cannot be
remediated, the business must ask Legal to review the contract and the exposure to the
Group Company.!>

The Company Secretariat will advise when such a breach must be reported and to whom
it must be reported in conjunction with the relevant company’s Risk Team.

1.8. The Risk

All contracts must be signed by an authorised signatory following the completion of the
relevant governance process. If this is not followed, there is a risk that the company enters
into contracts without proper scrutiny which could open the company up to significant
financial loss.

? Director for the purposes of this policy means statutory director and does not include colleagues whose job
title is director.

“ This method of signature is only acceptable where all other methods of signature are not possible.

*S Legal may propose an amendment to limit exposure. Such an amendment must be executed in
accordance with this policy and would constitute remediation of the initial breach.

An electronic signature must be executed in accordance with paragraph 1.5 to ensure the
risk of repudiation is minimal. In the event this cannot be proved, the validity of the
signature could be questioned and could prove inadmissible if challenged before a court.

Information within agreements may contain sensitive competitive commercial data or
personal information from individuals, such as our customers, colleagues postmasters and
business partners, and we need to use this in accordance with relevant legislation
(paragraph 1.9), the Policy Framework (paragraph 2.2) and minimum controls standards
(paragraph 2.4).

1.9. Legislation

The Group seeks to comply with all relevant UK legislation and regulatory requirements,
including but not limited to:

Common law

Companies Act 2006, specifically ss. 43 - 44

General Data Protection Regulation (2016/679 EU) and UK Data Protection Act 2018

2. Risk Appetite and Minimum Control
Standards

2.1. Risk Appetite

Risk appetite is the extent to which the Group will accept that a risk might happen in
pursuit of day to day businesses transactions. It therefore defines the boundaries of
activity and levels of exposure that the Group is willing and able to tolerate. The Group
takes its legal and regulatory responsibilities seriously and consequently has:

* Tolerant risk appetite for Legal and Regulatory risk in those limited
circumstances where there are significant conflicting imperatives between
conformance and commercial practicality.

« Averse risk appetite for not complying with law and regulations or deviation from
business’ conduct standards.

« Averse risk appetite for inefficient or ineffective processes that result in: lost
time, duplicated effort, and increased risk of financial losses or errors in any part
of its business or core processes.

« Averse risk appetite for inefficient or ineffective or prolonged failure of,
governance and control processes, critical financial reporting processes, critical
supply chain and business continuity processes.

The Group acknowledges however that in certain scenarios even after extensive controls
have been implemented a product or transaction may still sit outside the agreed risk
appetite. In this situation, a risk exception waiver will be required.

2.2. Policy Framework

Post Office has established a suite of key policies on a risk sensitive approach which are
subject to an annual review. The policy suite has been developed to comply with applicable
legislation and regulation, The suite of documents pertinent to this policy include:

« Cyber and Security Information Policy: A set of high level business principles
and activities to protect and assure Post Office’s information assets, including
critical business information systems, against compromise, unauthorised change,
unavailability, loss, damage and destruction.

« Acceptable Use Standard: Supports the Cyber and Security Information Policy
and governs the fair and acceptable use of Post Office’s information assets.

« Protecting Personal Data Policy: Requirements of Post Office employees and
third parties in relation to the collection, use, retention, transfer, disclosure and
destruction of personal data.

* Code of Business Standards: Our Business Standards set out Post Office’s vision
when dealing with customers, clients and colleagues. The Code explains our key
individual responsibilities and how to behave to make Post Office a success.

« Contract Management Framework: A clear and standardised management, risk
and governance framework that must be complied with in order to achieve effective
management of contracts and suppliers and clients.

POL00401629
POL00401629

POL-BSFF-0228299_ 0228
« Procurement Policy: Requirements that must be adhered to when procuring
goods and/or services from external suppliers (each Group company must adhere
to its own Policy as appropriate).

« Risk Management Framework: Comprising (i) the Risk Architecture (i.e. roles,
responsibilities, communication and risk reporting arrangements), (ii) the Risk
Protocols (i.e. rules and procedures, methodologies, tools and techniques) and (iii)
the Risk Strategy (i.e. appetite and attitude to Risk) (as applicable to each Group
company).

2.3. Who must comply?

Compliance with this policy is mandatory for all Post Office employees and applies
wherever in the world the Group’s business is undertaken. All external parties who do
business with the Group, including consultants, suppliers and business and franchise
partners, will be required to agree contractually to this policy or with their own equivalent

policy.

Where non-compliance is identified the matter must be referred to the policy owner. Any
investigations will be carried out in accordance with the Investigations Policy. Where it is
identified that that an instance of non-compliance is caused through wilful disregard or
negligence, this will be treated as a disciplinary offence.

The next page sets out the minimum control standards that the Group has implemented
to control these risks.

2.4. Minimum Control Standards

A minimum control standard is an activity which must be in place in order to manage the risks so they remain within the defined risk
appetite statements. There must be mechanisms in place within each business unit to demonstrate compliance. The minimum control
standards can cover a range of control types, i.e. directive, detective, corrective and preventive which are required to ensure risks are
managed to an acceptable level and within the defined Risk Appetite.

The table below sets out the relationships between identified risk and the required minimum control standards in consideration of the stated
risk appetite. The subsequent pages define the terms used in greater detail:

Tools & Definitions

3.1. Tools

3i2n

The Group has procured an approved e-signature solution.

Group authorised signatories are trained to understand the contract execution
process, only recognise requests from the Company Secretariat and to require
evidence of explicit consent (e.g. the CAF) to do business before engaging in the
signature process. Consent to electronically sign documents is built into the
workflow of the approved e-signature solution.

Definitions

Wet signature: Handwritten signature by an individual on an original hard copy
document.

. Seal: Company seal of the Company recognised under the company’s Articles of

Association.

Deed: A written document which is executed with the necessary formality (more
than a simple signature), and by which an interest, right or property passes or is
confirmed, or an obligation binding on some person is created or confirmed.

Electronic signature or e-signature: “Data in electronic form which is attached
to or logically associated with other data in electronic form and which is used by
the signatory to sign”.1® For the purposes of this policy, the Group position is that
this does not include the situations listed in section 1.4 (a-d).

Contract Approval Process: Internal governance process that must be
completed prior to the execution of an agreement with an external party (excluding
employment and agency contracts managed by HR). Guidance on the contract
approval process is available via the intranet. If you are unsure whether an eCAF
is required ior to contract execution, please email your query to

Contract Approval Form (CAF) or eCAF: The form used to complete the
Contract Approval Process. This form requires sign offs from the relevant
stakeholders within the business. This form!” can be found on the Company
Secretariat intranet page.

Virtual si ig: This refers to when a document is signed without all the parties
being physically present at the same meeting.

enter into contracts with external parties to various colleagues within the Group,

*© Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 (“eIDAS Regulation”) Article 3(10)

greater than normal risks (ii) accept some negative impact in order to pursue
objective (iii) accept some residual risk.

. Averse Risk: Risk appetite approach where Post Office (i) actively discourages risk
taking (ii) is not willing to accept any negative impact (iii) will mitigate or treat
risks in order to minimise residual risk.

12. Standard Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA): This is used when parties wish to
share and exchange confidential information. The Post Office Legal Team has
drafted and approved a Post Office House Position for NDAs. Where the House
Position template is used, no changes should be made to the contract (outside of
the guidance to the template). This type of NDA does not require a CAF.

13. Non-standard Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA): This is either a standard NDA
which has been amended outside the House Position detailed above or a NDA which
is entirely different to the standard template, such as an NDA provided by an
external party. This type of NDA requires a CAF.

first consulting the Company Secretariat.

Deeds may be signed by electronic signature, provided the other counterparty/ies agree(s)
to such a method of execution. The following must be adhered to:

- the business should obtain agreement by email from the other counterparty/ies to
sign electronically, as well as lay out the process, and this email should be provided
to the Company Secretariat?; and

- signature should be by two directors or a director and the company secretary.!°

The acceptable method of signature varies in accordance to the company:

1.6. Exceptions

In the ordinary course of events standard business procedures should be followed to
ensure that Post Office stays within its defined risk appetite. However, there are situations
where business requirements make it necessary to depart from approved policy and take
an informed decision to operate outside risk appetite. In these exceptional circumstances,
a ‘risk exception’ can be granted subject to the risk exception process. For more
information please contact the Enterprise Risk team for Post Office Limited or the relevant
Risk Team for Payzone Bill Payments LimitedPost Office Insurance does not permit
exceptions to its approved policies.

1.7. Breaches

A breach of this policy would include:

- where a contract has been signed by an unauthorised signatory from the relevant
Group Company;

- where a contract has been signed without first completing the Contract Approval
Process (where required); or

- where a contract is signed using the incorrect method of execution as detailed in
this policy.

In the event there is a breach of this policy, the incident must be recorded on the
respective company’s breach register. Where possible, the breach must be remediated
and the remediation recorded (for example, the contract is signed again by an authorised
signatory and/or by the correct execution method and the previous copy is disregarded).
Where the breach cannot be remediated (usually due to the passage of time), the breach
must be recorded on the respective company’s risk register. Where a breach cannot be
remediated, the business must ask Legal to review the contract and the exposure to the
Group Company.!>

The Company Secretariat will advise when such a breach must be reported and to whom
it must be reported in conjunction with the relevant company’s Risk Team.

1.8. The Risk

All contracts must be signed by an authorised signatory following the completion of the
relevant governance process. If this is not followed, there is a risk that the company enters
into contracts without proper scrutiny which could open the company up to significant
financial loss.

? Director for the purposes of this policy means statutory director and does not include colleagues whose job
title is director.

“ This method of signature is only acceptable where all other methods of signature are not possible.

*S Legal may propose an amendment to limit exposure. Such an amendment must be executed in
accordance with this policy and would constitute remediation of the initial breach.

An electronic signature must be executed in accordance with paragraph 1.5 to ensure the
risk of repudiation is minimal. In the event this cannot be proved, the validity of the
signature could be questioned and could prove inadmissible if challenged before a court.

Information within agreements may contain sensitive competitive commercial data or
personal information from individuals, such as our customers, colleagues postmasters and
business partners, and we need to use this in accordance with relevant legislation
(paragraph 1.9), the Policy Framework (paragraph 2.2) and minimum controls standards
(paragraph 2.4).

1.9. Legislation

The Group seeks to comply with all relevant UK legislation and regulatory requirements,
including but not limited to:

Common law

Companies Act 2006, specifically ss. 43 - 44

General Data Protection Regulation (2016/679 EU) and UK Data Protection Act 2018

2. Risk Appetite and Minimum Control
Standards

2.1. Risk Appetite

Risk appetite is the extent to which the Group will accept that a risk might happen in
pursuit of day to day businesses transactions. It therefore defines the boundaries of
activity and levels of exposure that the Group is willing and able to tolerate. The Group
takes its legal and regulatory responsibilities seriously and consequently has:

* Tolerant risk appetite for Legal and Regulatory risk in those limited
circumstances where there are significant conflicting imperatives between
conformance and commercial practicality.

« Averse risk appetite for not complying with law and regulations or deviation from
business’ conduct standards.

« Averse risk appetite for inefficient or ineffective processes that result in: lost
time, duplicated effort, and increased risk of financial losses or errors in any part
of its business or core processes.

« Averse risk appetite for inefficient or ineffective or prolonged failure of,
governance and control processes, critical financial reporting processes, critical
supply chain and business continuity processes.

The Group acknowledges however that in certain scenarios even after extensive controls
have been implemented a product or transaction may still sit outside the agreed risk
appetite. In this situation, a risk exception waiver will be required.

2.2. Policy Framework

Post Office has established a suite of key policies on a risk sensitive approach which are
subject to an annual review. The policy suite has been developed to comply with applicable
legislation and regulation, The suite of documents pertinent to this policy include:

« Cyber and Security Information Policy: A set of high level business principles
and activities to protect and assure Post Office’s information assets, including
critical business information systems, against compromise, unauthorised change,
unavailability, loss, damage and destruction.

« Acceptable Use Standard: Supports the Cyber and Security Information Policy
and governs the fair and acceptable use of Post Office’s information assets.

« Protecting Personal Data Policy: Requirements of Post Office employees and
third parties in relation to the collection, use, retention, transfer, disclosure and
destruction of personal data.

* Code of Business Standards: Our Business Standards set out Post Office’s vision
when dealing with customers, clients and colleagues. The Code explains our key
individual responsibilities and how to behave to make Post Office a success.

« Contract Management Framework: A clear and standardised management, risk
and governance framework that must be complied with in order to achieve effective
management of contracts and suppliers and clients.

INTERNAL Page 8 of 19 @BCL@380F15FO

POL00401629
POL00401629

POL-BSFF-0228299 0247
« Procurement Policy: Requirements that must be adhered to when procuring
goods and/or services from external suppliers (each Group company must adhere
to its own Policy as appropriate).

« Risk Management Framework: Comprising (i) the Risk Architecture (i.e. roles,
responsibilities, communication and risk reporting arrangements), (ii) the Risk
Protocols (i.e. rules and procedures, methodologies, tools and techniques) and (iii)
the Risk Strategy (i.e. appetite and attitude to Risk) (as applicable to each Group
company).

2.3. Who must comply?

Compliance with this policy is mandatory for all Post Office employees and applies
wherever in the world the Group’s business is undertaken. All external parties who do
business with the Group, including consultants, suppliers and business and franchise
partners, will be required to agree contractually to this policy or with their own equivalent

policy.

Where non-compliance is identified the matter must be referred to the policy owner. Any
investigations will be carried out in accordance with the Investigations Policy. Where it is
identified that that an instance of non-compliance is caused through wilful disregard or
negligence, this will be treated as a disciplinary offence.

The next page sets out the minimum control standards that the Group has implemented
to control these risks.

2.4. Minimum Control Standards

A minimum control standard is an activity which must be in place in order to manage the risks so they remain within the defined risk
appetite statements. There must be mechanisms in place within each business unit to demonstrate compliance. The minimum control
standards can cover a range of control types, i.e. directive, detective, corrective and preventive which are required to ensure risks are
managed to an acceptable level and within the defined Risk Appetite.

The table below sets out the relationships between identified risk and the required minimum control standards in consideration of the stated
risk appetite. The subsequent pages define the terms used in greater detail:

Tools & Definitions

3.1. Tools

3i2n

The Group has procured an approved e-signature solution.

Group authorised signatories are trained to understand the contract execution
process, only recognise requests from the Company Secretariat and to require
evidence of explicit consent (e.g. the CAF) to do business before engaging in the
signature process. Consent to electronically sign documents is built into the
workflow of the approved e-signature solution.

Definitions

Wet signature: Handwritten signature by an individual on an original hard copy
document.

. Seal: Company seal of the Company recognised under the company’s Articles of

Association.

Deed: A written document which is executed with the necessary formality (more
than a simple signature), and by which an interest, right or property passes or is
confirmed, or an obligation binding on some person is created or confirmed.

Electronic signature or e-signature: “Data in electronic form which is attached
to or logically associated with other data in electronic form and which is used by
the signatory to sign”.1® For the purposes of this policy, the Group position is that
this does not include the situations listed in section 1.4 (a-d).

Contract Approval Process: Internal governance process that must be
completed prior to the execution of an agreement with an external party (excluding
employment and agency contracts managed by HR). Guidance on the contract
approval process is available via the intranet. If you are unsure whether an eCAF
is required ior to contract execution, please email your query to

Contract Approval Form (CAF) or eCAF: The form used to complete the
Contract Approval Process. This form requires sign offs from the relevant

share and exchange confidential information. The Post Office Legal Team has
drafted and approved a Post Office House Position for NDAs. Where the House
Position template is used, no changes should be made to the contract (outside of
the guidance to the template). This type of NDA does not require a CAF.

13. Non-standard Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA): This is either a standard NDA
which has been amended outside the House Position detailed above or a NDA which
is entirely different to the standard template, such as an NDA provided by an
external party. This type of NDA requires a CAF.

1, Vulnerable Customer Policy

Ben Foat Paul Beaumont se September
2019

1.1 Purpose and Content of the Policy

The Vulnerable Customer Policy articulates Post Office’s expectations as to how we
support vulnerable customers across all our channels and that the operations of Post
Office do not have any negative impact upon vulnerable customers.

The policy aims to address that all members of staff who have any customer contact
have a duty to help ensure that vulnerable customers are treated fairly and when
vulnerability is identified adaptations are made to fully assist.

Addressing the needs of vulnerable customers is core to Post Office’s social purpose and
is aligned to our objectives to be ‘Better for Customers’ and a ‘Great Place to Work’.

The Policy outlines the core principles of customer vulnerability and emphasis that
vulnerability can impact in many ways and can be permanent or temporary.

The Post Office recognises that these customers may have additional needs and may be
described as ‘vulnerable’ although it is important to note that these customers may not
regard themselves as such. It is core to Post Office’s rationale and purpose to ensure
that appropriate respect and care is taken of all types of customer, including vulnerable
customers.

The Vulnerable Customer Policy sets out;

« The outcomes employees must achieve for customers;

« A framework for delivering these outcomes, including key controls and putting
things right when they go wrong;

« Key examples to think about when assessing what fair treatment means for
customers who may be deemed vulnerable

1.2 Key Definition

The FCA define a “vulnerable consumer” as: ‘Someone who, due to their personal
circumstances, is especially susceptible to detriment, particularly when a firm is not

acting with appropriate levels of care’.

1.3 Who Must Comply

all Post Office employees. Post Office will work with Agency network, Principals and key
commercial partners to ensure that where possible the spirit of our approach to
vulnerable customers is applied.

1.4 Key Laws and Regulations

There are a number of relevant UK legal and regulatory requirements which are
applicable including (but not limited to):

I. Ofcom duties under the Communications Act

Il. Equality Act 2010
Ill. Mental Capacity Act 2005 and guidance

V. Disability Discrimination Act (Northern Ireland) 2005.

VI. Adults with Incapacity (Scotland) Act 2000. ( Consumer vulnerability regulation

Ut. Money Advice Service
IV. Pensions Advisory Service
V. Alzheimer’s Society guidance on Mental Capacity Act provisions Gov.uk
VI. Citizen's Advice Bureau
Vi. Ofcom's Fairness Principles
VIII. Ofcom guidelines on Vulnerability

The Department of Business Energy and Industrial Strategy Green paper has the
protection of vulnerable customers as a key strategic priority for government. Under
both Ofcom and FCA rules there could be regulatory interventions for not treating
vulnerable customers fairly.

1.5 Risk Appetite and Minimum Control Standards

Regulators are attaching increasing importance to customer vulnerability, therefore
current regulation and legislation regarding customer vulnerability means that the Group
needs to have a robust risk approach to vulnerability, including implementing effective
policies and procedures to ensure a consistent approach is being taken across the group
and operations are clear to mitigate such risks when they arise.

The Group has an Averse Risk Appetite and zero tolerance for:

« Regulatory breaches; or
e unfair customer outcomes arising from product design, sales or after sales
processes.

The policy outlines minimum control standards across 2 areas of risk. Below is an
example of the relationships between the risk area and the required minimum control
standards to meet the stated risk appetite:

1. Overview

1.1. Introduction by the Policy Owner

Significant groups in our communities are impacted either temporarily or
permanently by vulnerability. For example;

. There are 850 thousand people in the UK with dementia and this is expected
to rise to a million over the next three years ( Alzheimer’s Society 2018)

. In any given year one in four of the adult population suffers a mental illness
(NHS 2017)

. Over 2 million people in the UK are coping with sight loss (RNIB 2019)
° 8.8 million people in the UK have caring responsibilities. (Carers UK 2019)

. There were 2.5 million people living with cancer in 2015. This will rise to 4
million by 2030 (Macmillan 2019)

. One in 6 adults have very poor literacy skills: (National Literacy Trust 2019)

° Just under a half of the population has numeracy attainment skills of a child

at primary school (National Numeracy 2017)

At the Post Office we are committed to providing quality products and services for
all our customers. We work in an open and responsible way that builds the trust
and respect of all our customers. Post Office seeks to ensure that all customers
can make good buying decisions and have a positive experience when dealing with
us.

Addressing the needs of vulnerable customers is core to Post Office’s social
purpose and is aligned to our objectives to be ‘Better for Customers’ and a ‘Great
Place to Work’. There are countless examples of how we assist customers when
they need us most. This policy outlines the policy approach so that we continue to
ensure that we are able to look after the needs of vulnerable customers.

1.2, Purpose

To articulate Post Office’s expectations as to how we support vulnerable customers
across all our channels.

This will also be an important document and source of information on Post Office’s
policy approach to vulnerable customers for many of our stakeholders.

1.3 Definition

A vulnerable customer is someone who, due to their personal circumstances, is
more likely to require additional support to access the services provided by Post
Office.

INTERNAL Page 4 of 16 @BCL@780BF2AF 1.1

POL00401629
POL00401629

POL-BSFF-0228299_ 0267
Customers may be vulnerable due to circumstances such as age, physical or
learning disability, physical or mental illness, low literacy, communications
difficulties or changes in circumstances such as bereavement.

1.4 Core Principles

Vulnerability can impact in many ways and can be permanent or temporary, these
categories are examples. The Post Office recognises that these customers may
have additional needs and may be described as ‘vulnerable’ although it is
important to note that these customers may not regard themselves as such. It is
core to Post Office’s rationale and purpose to ensure that appropriate respect and
care is taken of all types of customer, including vulnerable customers.

Categories include:

A. Restricted Mobility E. Mental Capacity
B. Communications needs including sight and F. Age Related Vulnerability
hearing loss G. Life Event Vulnerability
C. Low Basic Skills e.g., bereavement, critical illness,
D. Low Financial Capability redundancy

H. Financial Difficulties

1.5 Examples

There are already many examples of how Post Office assists vulnerable customers
these include:

e POca serves to meet the needs of the most vulnerable in society including
the ‘unbanked’ and ‘financially excluded’ through facilitating government
payments into a cash account with proprietary card access

e During Covid 19 we have developed alternative ways for vulnerable
customers to access cash

e Bill payments operates as a key service for vulnerable customers. In
particular the unbanked and those financially excluded. Ability to pay bills
via the SSK gives vulnerable customers additional support through trained
people on hand.

e Numerous examples of community outreach and partnerships with local
charities/vulnerable customers made through Agency branches.

« The Banking Framework is a key demonstration of how Post Office is
supporting elderly and vulnerable customers. We are increasingly the last
‘bank’ in town as bank branches close supporting those who prefer to do
their banking in branch with the additional support that Post Offices can
offer at the counter.

« A Banking process currently exists for vulnerable customers when they are
unable to use the chip & Pin functionality.

« Updating our branch accessibility guidance using specialist accessibility
consultants

« Working with partners such as Bol who have given forbearance measures
under Covid 19 but who also give case by case exceptions to the ‘terms of
conditions’ for vulnerable customers recognising their condition, for

INTERNAL Page 5 of 16 @BCL@780BF2AF 1.1

example customers in hospital unable to read banking correspondence and
statements, or those that have suffered a bout of mental illness.

e Vulnerable customer training module on Success Factors and further
development planned to enhance the Customer Experience Academy.

e In telecoms those who are struggling to pay, can have a new COVID 19 flag
added to their account and there are measures in place to help

« In telecoms we have also set up a triage desk to deal with escalated issues.
This has involved sending out temporary mobile phones for customers who
have a fault on their line which will take a while to fix (e.g. Openreach need
to fix a cable that a digger cut through at the exchange) and yet their
landline is their lifeline.

e In telecoms we have committed to Ofcom's fairness commitments, which
give significant undertakings to support vulnerable customers

1.7 Application
Accessibility Guidance.

The Post Office Health and Safety team provide network accessibility guidance
with the help of outside experts. Much of this is based on the current legal
requirements particularly the Equality Act. It is the responsibility of staff and
Postmasters to ensure that they comply with and observe these requirements,
and where there is any uncertainty, to seek clarification from relevant Post Office
subject matter experts to ensure compliance. This guidance also provides useful
advice on how to support vulnerable customers in branch.

Customer facing individuals and their managers

We do not expect these people to be able to diagnose vulnerabilities. But we would
expect these individuals to, listen to our customers, empathise and ask how we
can help meet their needs, preparing to be flexible in meeting their needs where
this is possible. In certain, circumstances (Telco call centres) we do also ask that
where appropriate they suggest the customer informs us of their vulnerability so
we can discuss how we can best meet their needs.

Those involved in the design of products and services and the processes that
support their distribution and sale.

Design and processes for customer related projects and processes should consider
how a vulnerable customer could take that journey. Gating requirements for
customer facing projects should consider customer vulnerability requirements as
part of the assessment process.

The Compliance team will provide guidance regarding the legal requirements,
regulatory guidance and relevant industry body recommendations, as well as Post
Office recommended best practice.

Publication of a telecoms vulnerable customer policy

POL-BSFF-0228299_ 0269
In accordance with Ofcom’s General Conditions regulation, Post Office have a
specific telecoms vulnerability policy which is published on our website and
reviewed annually. Customer who are vulnerable have vulnerability flags on the
system and the call centre is trained accordingly.

1.8 Risk

By not addressing the needs of vulnerable customers, the impact could be
significant for those customers that depend on us to deliver our products and
services. These risks are included in the minimum control standards section below
but could include customers not being able to access our branches, products or
services, inappropriate purchases and not being able to understand the features
or terms and conditions of a product or service.

It could also cause reputational damage undermining Post Office’s achievement of
its social purpose. The Department of Business Energy and Industrial Strategy has
the protection of vulnerable customers as a key strategic priority for government.
Under both Ofcom and FCA rules there could be regulatory interventions for not
treating vulnerable customers fairly or having the correct policies in place.

2 Risk Appetite and Minimum Control Standards

2.1. Risk Appetite

A Risk Appetite is the extent to which the Group will accept that a risk might
happen in pursuit of day to day businesses transactions. It therefore defines the
boundaries of activity and levels of exposure that the Group are willing and able
to tolerate.

Post Office's risk appetite is averse for:

* non-compliance with law and regulations or deviation from its business conduct
standards, and

e for taking risks which might result in failure to maintain the service
commitment in respect of customers in line with our social purpose and
Government’s policy on subsidy.

The Group acknowledges however that in certain scenarios even after extensive
controls have been implemented a product or transaction may still sits outside the
agreed Risk Appetite. In exceptional circumstances a Risk Exemption waiver may
be granted.

2.2 Policy Framework

Post Office’s Board has overall responsibility for ensuring that Post Office has a
framework to ensure compliance with legal, regulatory and contractual
requirements. The Board is kept abreast of relevant matters relating to the
management of vulnerable customer matters by reports from its committees
including its Audit and Risk Committee.

It is the responsibility of the policy owners to review this policy at least once a
year and on an ad hoc basis as necessary to ensure the policy remains effective
and up to date.

This policy will be reviewed by The Post Office Risk and Compliance Committee at
least once each year from the last date this policy was determined effective.

2.3. Who must comply?

Compliance with this policy is mandatory for all Post Office employees. We will
work with our Agency network, Principals and key commercial partners to ensure
that where we can the spirit of our approach to vulnerable customers is applied.

2.4 Minimum Control Standards

A minimum control standard is an activity which must be in place in order to
manage the risks within the defined Risk Appetite statements contained within the
table below. To comply with this, mechanisms must be in place within each

INTERNAL Page 9 of 16 @BCL@780BF2AF 1.1

business unit or product to demonstrate compliance. The minimum control
standards can cover a range of control types, i.e. directive, detective, corrective
and preventive which are required to ensure risks are managed to an acceptable
level and within the defined Risk Appetite.

The minimum control standard for the vulnerable customer policy is ‘directive’ and
will be communicated to staff through staff communications and intranet.

The table below sets out some of the key relationships between identified risk, the considered Risk Appetite, and the required minimum

control standards:

Risk Area

Description of Risk

Minimum Control Standards

Who is responsible

Physical access to the
branch network is
difficult

A) Restricted Mobility

A customer may be particularly vulnerable
because they have mobility restrictions;
this means that it might be difficult for
them to gain physical access to our
premises. Or to use our facilities in branch
(eg Pin Pads)

« Articulated in Accessibility Guidance. We
will follow the requirements of the
Equality Act and seek where it is possible
to do so to make ‘reasonable
adjustments’ to our business premises to
allow customers with mobility restrictions
to access our business premises.

« Where we are not able to make such
adjustments we will seek, where it is
reasonable to do so, to provide the
customer with an equivalent service
through other means. For example a
Banking process currently exists for
DDA/vulnerable customers when they are
unable to use the chip & Pin functionality.

Head of Health and
Safety

Customer engagement
with products and
services is not possible
or limited because of a
vulnerability

B) Communications Needs

A customer may be particularly vulnerable
because they have a hearing or sight
impairment, which means they require
specially adapted methods of
communication.

« We will look to make ‘reasonable
adjustments’ to the way in which we are
able to communicate with our customers.
For instance for sight impairment, we will
seek to ensure that our customer
documentation is available in a range of
formats to help them understand our
product material and product-life cycle
communications.

requirements for Public Sector websites
and Apps

C) Low Basic Skills

A customer may be particularly vulnerable
because they have a low level of basic
skills and therefore require additional or
specialised assistance to effectively make
use of our products and services or, during
the course of the product life-cycle,
interact with us and manage their financial
position effectively.

We will seek to work positively and
constructively with customers that have,
or appear to have, a low level of basic
skills.

We will seek to ensure that the use of
jargon is minimised within our
documentation. Where it is used we aim
to ensure that there is an easy to
understand explanation of the term.

We will look to provide sign-posting to
free independent sources of information
and support that the customer can access
in relevant documentation and sections of
our websites.

We will seek to explore how to simplify
the information that we provide to
customers, for example, through the
standardised terms and conditions to
highlight parts that matter. If
appropriate we will engage with
government and industry initiatives

D) Low Financial Capability

A customer may be particularly vulnerable
because they have a low level of financial
capability (e.g. a specific lack of the maths
skills and knowledge of financial products or
matters) and therefore may require more
straight-forward explanations.

Page 12 of 16

We aim to be clear and fair and not
misleading in communications with
customers, and wherever possible we will
seek to avoid ‘jargon’. We will strive to
explain our products and services,
including associated risks to customers,
in a manner which is easily
understandable.

ensure there is sufficient ‘sign-posting’

proposition to charities and other not-for-
profit organisations that provide

E) Mental Capacity

A customer may be particularly vulnerable
because they have a mental capacity
limitation (for instanced dementia, a
learning disability, a development disorder,
a neurological disability) that may restrict
their ability to appropriately engage with us
or make an informed and_ responsible
borrowing decision.

Horizon Help)

We aim in our dealings with a customer
who we know, or reasonably suspect has
a mental capacity limitation, to act
sympathetically and positively.

We seek to allow a customer sufficient
time to weigh-up the information and
explanations we have provided and defer
a decision to a later date. We will seek to
provide all the information required to
enable a customer to do this. Where
possible we should ask if the individual
would like to consider this decision with a
family member or trusted person.

F) Age Related Vulnerability

A customer may be particularly vulnerable
as a consequence of the effects aging can
have on an_ individual; this includes
potential memory loss, dementia or the
potential for the customer to be
‘overwhelmed’ by a particular situation.

assume that a customer is vulnerable by

is appropriate in some circumstances to
explain clearly risks which relate to
ageing customers e.g., for end of life
planning products.

decision with a family member or trusted
person.

G) Life Event Vulnerability

A customer that has or is experiencing a
specific adverse ‘life event’ (for example,
redundancy, a bereavement, critical or
terminal illness, or a marriage breakdown)
could be particularly susceptible to making
poor judgements. (Although these triggers
may not always have a negative impact on
the individual)

We should aim to treat these customers
fairly and with a level of sympathy and
positivity. We aim to ensure, throughout
our businesses, that when we become
aware of these life events we have the
ability to respond flexibly and deliver an
outcome that is appropriate.

H) Financial Difficulties

Customers that are in financial difficulties
(for instance high levels of debt or low
levels of income) may be particularly
vulnerable to financial detriment.

difficulties when designing or introducing

It also makes reference to Cognisance being made from a terrorism perspective in light
that it currently presents a major threat to businesses. Terrorist groups may seek to
cause harm to the economy as a whole by attacking business premises or they may seek
to attack specific businesses to advance their political agendas. Whilst there are no

POL00401629
POL00401629

specific threats to Post Office Ltd, considerations should be made of a potential terrorist
threat (explosive, hostile vehicle, lone wolf etc).

Through this approach, the Group will maintain customer confidence, protect the Group's
customers, colleagues, commercial interests and reputation

1.2Key definition

Physical Security is the protection of people, property and physical assets from actions
and events that could cause damage or loss. It describes security measures that are

the design and implementation of controls for the physical protection of Post Office people
and assets, and physical security is an agenda item for the Audit and Risk Committee and
the Post Office board is updated as required.

1.2. Purpose

This Policy has been established to set the minimum operating standards relating to the
management of our physical security risks throughout the group!. It is one of a set of
policies which provide a clear risk and governance framework and an effective system of
internal control for the management of risk across the group.

This policy sits over a number of Security Sub-Policies including:
* CCTV Deployment Policy and Code of Practice
* Lone Worker Policy
* Tiger Kidnap or Hostage Policy
* Incident Management Policy
* Overseas Travel Policy

Compliance with these policies supports the Group in meeting its business objectives and
to balance the needs of shareholders, employees and other stakeholders.

1.3. Core Principles

The core principles covered by this policy are to aid in ensuring:

«the protection of personnel, Post Office assets and data from physical circumstances and
events that could harm our people or cause serious losses or damage.

* protection from crime and terrorism
* the physical security vision and framework

By implementation of mitigating controls as defined in the minimum control standards of this
document, PO can lower the risks against the above threats.

1.4. Application

This Policy is applicable to all areas within the Group and defines the minimum standards

The risk to the Group in relation to physical security is reviewed by the board annually.

1.5. Legislation

All employers have a responsibility, as far as reasonably practicable, to provide a
workplace that is safe and secure. In Great Britain, the general duty set out in the Health
and Safety at Work Act 1974 to protect the health and safety of employees applies to risks
from violence, just as it does to other risks at work

1.6. Industry Guidance

Effective physical security is achieved by multi-layering the different measures. The
concept is based on the principle that the security is not significantly reduced with the loss
of any single layer. Each layer of security may be comprised of different elements,
including for example:

e Measures to assist in the detection of threat weapons, including for example
explosives, knives, firearms etc.

« Measures to assist in the detection, tracking and monitoring of intruders and other
threats

« Access control and locking systems

«Physical and active barriers to deny or delay the progress of adversaries

« Measures to protect people or assets from the effect of blast or ballistic attack
« Measures to protect sensitive (e.g. classified) material or assets

* Command and control

«The response to an incident

«Security personnel

The above measures are interdependent and their effectiveness will be dictated by their
ability to support one another.

Cognisance must also be made from a terrorism perspective in light that it currently
presents a major threat to businesses. Terrorist groups may seek to cause harm to the
economy as a whole by attacking business premises or they may seek to attack specific
businesses to advance their political agendas. Whilst there are no specific threats to Post
Office Ltd, consideration when completing this report should be made of a potential
terrorist threat (explosive, hostile vehicle, lone wolf etc).

2. Risk Appetite and Minimum Control
Standards

2.1. Risk Appetite

Risk Appetite is the extent to which the Group will accept that a risk might happen in
pursuit of day to day businesses transactions. It therefore defines the boundaries of
activity and levels of exposure that the Group are willing and able to tolerate.

The Group takes its legal and regulatory responsibilities seriously and consequently has:
*  Averse appetite to any physical harm to our people or Post Office assets

« Tolerant risk appetite for Legal and Regulatory risk in those limited circumstances
where there are significant conflicting imperatives between conformance and
commercial practicality

«  Averse risk appetite for litigation in relation to high profile cases/issues
«  Averse risk appetite for ligation in relation to Financial Services matters

«  Averse risk appetite for not complying with law and regulations or deviation from
business’ conduct standards for financial crime to occur within any part of the Group

e  Averse Risk Appetite in relation to unethical behaviour by our staff.

The Group acknowledges however that in certain scenarios even after extensive controls
have been implemented a product or transaction may still sit outside the agreed Risk
Appetite. In this situation, a risk exception waiver will be required.

2.2. Policy Framework

Post Office has established an overarching policy, the Physical Security Policy and a suite
of key policies on a risk sensitive approach which are subject to an annual review. Clear
policies and procedures support effective decision making and delegation because they
provide guidance on what people can and cannot do, what decisions they can make and
what activities are appropriate. Having up-to-date and appropriate policies is an important
part of our general control environment and supports us in achieving our objectives and
protecting our reputation, in an efficient manner.

2.3. Who must comply?

Compliance with this Policy is mandatory for all Post Office employees and applies
wherever in the world the Group’s business is undertaken. All third parties who do business
with the Group, including consultants, suppliers and business and franchise partners, will
be required to agree contractually to this Policy with their own equivalent Policy.

Where non-compliance is identified the matter must be referred to the Directors of Risk
and Compliance and the Group Legal Director. Any investigations will be carried out in
accordance with the Investigations Policy. Where is it identified that that an instance of
non-compliance is caused through wilful disregard or negligence, this will be treated as a
disciplinary offence.

2.4. Minimum Control Standards

POL00401629

POL00401629

A minimum control standard is an activity which must be in place in order to manage the risks so they remain within the defined Risk
Appetite statements. There must be mechanisms in place within each business unit to demonstrate compliance. The minimum control
standards can cover a range of control types, i.e. directive, detective, corrective and preventive which are required to ensure risks are
managed to an acceptable level and within the defined Risk Appetite.

The table below sets out the relationships between identified risk and the required minimum control standards in consideration of the stated
risk appetite. The subsequent pages define the terms used in greater detail:

1. HMRC Fit and Proper Standards Policy

iE Hic

Ben Foat Sally Smith ‘GRO {I September 2020

1.1 Purpose and Content of the Policy Standard

Sets the minimum operating standards relating to the design and implementation of controls to
ensure that the Fit & Proper Requirements under the Money Laundering Regulations 2017 (MLRs)
are complied with throughout the Group. It is sub-ordinate to the Anti-Money Laundering and
Counter Terrorist Financing Policy (AML/CTF) which provides a clear risk and governance
framework and an effective system of internal control for the mitigation of risk across the Group.

Post Office is supervised by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) for anti-money laundering
purposes in relation to its Money Service Business (currently Branch on-demand and pre-order
Bureau de Change) and is therefore subject to the regulatory fit and proper requirements.

The requirements are designed to ensure that those individuals and agents that are responsible for
overseeing relevant activity are suitable to undertake those roles. Post Office has devised a robust
policy standard and associated procedures which are proportionate to the risks and complexity of
the Group.

The governance arrangements described in the policy standard are based on the following taking
place:

* The Group ensures that its policies reflect the principles of the AML and CTF regulations and
legislation;

* The Group’s overall and ongoing risk management process includes a risk based assessment of
the risks to which the Group and its business are exposed, and the quality of its AML and CTF
controls and monitoring;

* The Group undertakes a training and awareness program to ensure employees and agents
are aware of the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing, what they should do if they
are suspicious, and the consequences should they fail to comply with the law;

* The Group promotes ethical and professional standards to prevent it from being used,
intentionally or unintentionally by criminals;

* Decisions taken by management are consistent with the Board’s approved strategic objectives
and Risk Appetite;

* Every member of staff is responsible for understanding and managing the risks they take on
behalf of the Group;

* Clear accountabilities are delegated by management to staff who have the right level of skill,
competency and experience;

e All employees are required to comply with Group Policies.
1.2 Key definition

Money laundering is the process whereby criminals retain, disguise and conceal the proceeds of
their crimes, or raise, consolidate or retain funds for use in financing terrorism. In UK law
money laundering is defined in the Proceeds of Crimes Act 2002 (POCA) and includes all forms of
handling or possessing criminal property, including possessing the proceeds of one's own crime,
and facilitating any handling or possession of criminal property.

Failure to manage AML/CTF risks can result in financial loss, customer impact, terrorism,
regulatory breaches, fines, prosecution, prevention from selling a particular product, loss of
existing or future contracts/relationships and damage to reputation.

HMRC Fit and Proper - HMRC requires that all those designated as responsible persons in
businesses regulated by them under the MLRs apply for and undertake the HMRC Fit & Proper test,
or that they have (and can demonstrate that they have) controls in place to ensure the responsible
persons of their agents are fit and proper.

1.3 Who Must Comply

All Post Office employees, agents and Commercial Partners and applies wherever in the world the
Group's business is undertaken.

1.4 Key Laws and Regulations

The Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer)
Regulations 2017 (“Money Laundering Regulations") apply to the Post Office as an MSB registered
with HMRC, and along with HMRC guidance, sets out the requirements for Fit & Proper tests to
include all relevant senior managers, agents and beneficial owners.

1.5 Risk Appetite and Minimum Control Standards

The policy standard defines the minimum standards to control financial loss, customer impact,
regulatory breaches and reputational damage in line with the Group’s Risk Appetite. It also
outlines the Post Office’s definition of responsible persons and incorporates a list of impacted
Direct Employee roles.

Post Office has an Averse risk appetite for financial crime to occur within any part of the
organization. Non-compliance with the Policy Standard could result in suspension or cancellation
by HMRC of Post Office's MSB registration, prohibition of an individual from holding a managerial
role, reputational damage, court orders and regulatory inspections, prosecution of individuals
within Post Office and financial penalties, which are publicly notified.

The policy outlines minimum control standards across 7 areas of risk. Below is an example of the
relationships between the risk area and the required minimum control standards to meet the
stated risk appetite:

Tab 12 Policies for Approval

1. Overview

1.1. Introduction by the Standard Owner

The General Counsel has overall accountability to the Board of Directors for the design and
implementation of controls to prevent and deter Financial Crime, which includes Anti
Money Laundering (AML) and Counter Terrorist Financing (CTF). ComplianceFinanciat
Grime is an agenda item for the Audit and Risk Committee and the Post Office Board is
updated as required

1.2. Purpose

This policy standard has been established to set the minimum operating standards relating
to the design and implementation of controls to ensure that the Fit & Proper Requirements
under the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on
the Payer) Regulations 2017- are complied with throughout the Group. It is sub-ordinant
to the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Terrorist Financing Policy which provides a clear
risk and governance framework and an effective system of internal control for the
mitigation of risk across the Group. Compliance with these policies supports the Group in
meeting its business objectives and to balance the needs of shareholders, employees and
other stakeholders.

1.3. Core Principles

Money Laundering and Terrorist Finanacing are criminal offences and everyone working in
the business has a personal obligation to prevent them taking place. Post Office is
supervised by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) for anti-money laundering purposes in
relation to its Money Service Business (MSB) (currently Branch on-demand and pre-order
Bureau de Change) and is therefore subject to the regulatory fit and proper requirements.
These requirements are designed to ensure that those individuals and agents that are
responsible for overseeing relevant- activity within the regulated parts of the business are
suitable people to undertake those roles.

Post Office! has devised a robust policy standard and associated procedures (set out in
this document) which are proportionate to the risks and complexity of the Group. The
governance arrangements described in this policy standard are based on the following
taking place:

* The Group ensures that its policies reflect the principles of the AML and CTF regulations
and legislation;

* The Group’s overall and ongoing risk management process includes a risk based
assessment of the risks to which the Group and its business are exposed, and the quality
of its AML and CTF controls and monitoring;

activity in the branch network), and individuals Post Office employs to oversee or

manage the screening,-and propriety and training of our agents, but not managers _

who are not routinely involved in the AML and CTF policies and procedure of the
business.

= does not have any unspent convictions for offences set out in Schedule 3 to
the Money Laundering Regulations;

= has disclosed to us cértain other criminal convictions or regulatory, supervisory
or disciplinary actions that may be relevant to an assessment of honesty and
integrity;

+ has the requisite competence and capabilities (including any necessary
training) See Appendix B forTraining Matrix;

+ remains financially sound (including tax affairs).

The criteria for the assessment of financial soundness for fit & proper purposes is set out

in the Fit & Proper Team's processes. These processes are subject to annual review and
approval by the Declarations Oversight Commi __—-{ Commented [S52]: Amended to reflect practice )

While Post Office does not tolerate events that are criminal in nature and which may give
rise to unacceptable and illegal behaviour, it recognises that despite its many endeavours,
it is not possible to eliminate all risk of Post Office being used to facilitate Money
Laundering or Terrorist Financing activities, and therefore takes a risk based approach.

Failure to comply with the requirements of this policy standard by any employee will be
regarded as a significant breach impacting on the Group’s risk and control environment.
and may lead to disciplinary action up to and including dismissal and possible prosecution

Where an instance of non-compliance is caused through wilful disregard or negligence,
this will be treated as a disciplinary offence (for direct employees) or as a contractual
breach (for agents).

In exceptional circumstances, where risk sits outside of the Group's accepted Risk Appetite
a Risk Exception can be granted. Further information in relation to the risk exception
process, together with a template can be found on the Intranet (link)

The risk to the Group in relation to Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing is reviewed
by the Board as part of its wider commitment to Financial Crime on a regular basis.

1.5. Legislation

The Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the
Payer) Regulations 2017 ("Money Laundering Regulations") apply to the Post Office as a
MSB registered with HMRC, and set out the requirements for Fit & Proper tests to include
all relevant senior managers, agents and beneficial owners,

1.6. Consequences of Post Office not complying with the Fit and
Proper requirements

If Post Office does not comply with the fit and proper requirements it could be subject to:

* Suspension or cancellation by HMRC of Post Office's MSB registration, resulting in the
suspension or withdrawal of our Bureau de Change product, and subsequent damage to
Post Office Brand and/or loss of other business (e.g. acting as an agent for MoneyGram)

* Prohibition of an individual from holding a managerial role

* A public statement naming and censuring the business or a person, which can cause
serious branch impact and reputational damage

2. Risk Appetite and Minimum Control
Standards

2.1. Risk Appetite

Risk Appetite is the extent to which the Group will accept that a risk might happen in
pursuit of day to day business transactions. It therefore defines the boundaries of activity
and levels of exposure that the Group are willing and able to tolerate.

The Group takes its legal and regulatory responsibilities seriously and consequently has:

* Tolerant risk appetite for Legal and Regulatory risk in those limited circumstances
where there are significant conflicting imperatives between conformance and commercial
practicality

* Averse risk appetite for litigation in relation to high profile cases/issues
* Averse risk appetite for litigation in relation to Financial Services matters

* Averse risk appetite for not complying with law and regulations or for deviation from
business’ conduct standards for financial crime prevention within any part of the Group

* Averse Risk Appetite in relation to unethical behaviour by our staff.

The Group acknowledges however that in certain scenarios even after extensive controls
have been implemented a product or transaction may still sit outside the agreed Risk
Appetite. In this situation, a risk exception waiver will be required.

2.2. Standard Framework

Post Office has established a suite of financial crime prevention policies and procedures,
on a risk sensitive approach, which are subject to annual review. The policy suite is
designed to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, bribery and corruption,
facilitation of tax evasion, fraud and ensure adherence to relevant sanctions regimes.

The HMRC Fit & Proper Policy is a policy standard relating to the Anti-Money Laundering
and Counter Terrorist Policy and should be considered and read in conjunction with the
‘overarching Financial Crime Policy where relevant.

2.3. Who must comply?

Compliance with this policy standard is mandatory for all Post Office employees?, agents,
and Commercial Partners and applies wherever in the world the Group’s business is
undertaken
