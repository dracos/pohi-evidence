Reference: - Losses and Gains
Dear Alan,

Further to our conversation, you confirmed that you have been rolling over losses and
gains for the past two years or more. I was unaware of this Practice taking place at Craig
Y Don and acknowledge your comment that you wrote to the Post Office regarding
Horizon, losses and gains over two years ago and that to date you have not received any
reply or acknowledgment.

I am now instructing you, that with immediate effect, your are required to make good the
outstanding loss and to cease with this current Practice of rolling over any losses and
gains.

Please be advised that Subpostmasters are responsible for all losses caused through

their own negligence, carelessness or error and also for losses of all kinds caused by their

assistants. Deficiencies due to such losses must be made good without delay. With regard

to gains, surpluses may be withdrawn Provided that any subsequent charge up to the

amount withdrawn is made good immediately. I

Thank you

Yours sincerely

Mike Wakiey
