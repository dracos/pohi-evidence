Janet

Thanks totally understand on the dates ~ and will try and resolve quickly at this end.

On the letter there is a need for a follow up to the email with the date as you suggest and also setting out what we were
hoping to get out of the meeting etc. and the latter bit is the bit we need to agree before writing.

A call would be good — how about 12 today?
Thanks

David

Hi David
Thanks for your message.

Two things if I may. Can we nail the date for the proposed meeting down swiftly please? I will need to do this
before next Tuesday if we are to get anything into MPs’ diaries for March. I am afraid that they get booked up
months in advance.

Secondly, the email to MPs from James that I forwarded to you has already been sent out to them. Perhaps
we can have a chat about the letter you mention ~ this might be something we can send out to MPs with an
announcement and date of the meeting in March. Anyway, might it be a geod idea to talk it through? If so, let
me know a time and I'll give you a call.

Kind regards,
Janet

Janet,

Thanks for this and the other email and apologies for not getting back to you sooner. I am checking on dates with Alice
and Paula’s offices now.

In terms of next steps I agree it was a very positive meeting and it would be good to get an agreed note of the

meeting. I have one drafted that I will aim to get over to you today for your views and comments to make sure I have
covered everything.

With regard to the letter to MPs I think it is key that that goes soon but also that it sets out clearly the ground rules that
James, Paula and Alice discussed in the meeting . To that extent I think it would be helpful to work on the draft jointly as
was agreed in the meeting. I am happy to have a first go at the draft and get it over to you to have a look at.

Regards

David

Dear David,

Further to my message earlier, please find the following, which James sent to all relevant MPs, Second Sight,
Alan Bates and Kay Linnell, this morning.

Dear Colleague,

I know that some of you are very keen to meet soon to discuss how the matter of SubPostmaster
investigations is progressing. I had originally envisaged calling a meeting in January but this has not been
possible. The reason for the delay is because the mediation process by which accepted cases are now being
investigated has taken a while to get up and running formally. I sent you a message last year describing this
process, with its formal working party, chairman, and procedures.

Last week, I had discussions with Second Sight, the independent investigators, with the JFSA, and with senior
management at the Post Office to establish how things were going. I am now in a position to advise that a
meeting will be called near the beginning of March. I am trying to confirm possible dates, something not made
easy by the fact that I would like all those mentioned above to attend.

Iam sorry to have to ask you to be patient a little while longer. The mediation process remains, to my mind,
the very best chance our constituents have for redressing their situation. I believe it is working, I understand it
is necessarily taking longer than we would all like, but I would be sorry if haste were to ruin its chances of
success.

I will be in touch within the next week with a suggested date.

Yours ever,
James
