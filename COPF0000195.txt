Mrs Rosemary Stewart was employed by Mr Ahmed El Kasaby, Subpostmaster to manage Post Office
services at Gorbals Post Office (PO), 12-16 Ninian Terrace, Glasgow, G5 ORJ from 02nd February 2006
to 29th November 2012. A Thirty Four Thousand One Hundred and Seventy Nine pounds Fifty Four
(£34,179.54) net shortage was discovered during an audit at Gorbals PO on 29th November 2012. Mrs
Stewart made admissions during audit that she had been covering up shortages in the branch. In her
role as Manager of Hamilton PO Mrs Stewart was in a position of trust.
Mrs Jacqueline El Kasaby resides at
“GRO. Hr Ahmed El Kasaby, Subpostmaster Gorbals Post Office.

Mrs Jacqueline El Kasaby was employed as an Assistant to provide Post Office services at Gorbals Post
Office (PO), 12-16 Ninian Terrace, Glasgow, G5 ORJ from 2009 to 29th November 2012. Her role in the
branch was to deal with sales while working on the retail side of the business. In her role as an Assistant
in Gorbals PO Mrs El Kasaby was in a position of trust.

4.2 Summary of Evidence
4.2.1 Description of locus

The locus of the offence is Gorbals PO, G5 ORJ. The Post Office has six counter positions and a retail
area. The Post Office is situated down from a shopping area and has housing above it.

4.2.2 Description of event

Mrs Rosemary Stewart, Manager has embezzled Thirty Two Thousand Three Hundred and Seventy
Nine pounds Fifty Four (£32,379.54) of Post Office money. Stewart has disguised the embezzlement of
Post Office monies by firstly inflating the unusable notes in the office. After claiming to receive a phone
call to return the unusable notes she hid the embezzlement by transferring monies from Stock Units 04
to ZZ and vice versa. By doing so she was removing the cash figure from the accounts and placing it in
the ether. That amount of cash would then not be accounted for in the branch by the Horizon system.
She also inflated the Lottery Scratchcards figures to disguise a further shortage in the branch.

On Thursday 29th November 2012 Lindsay Young, Alicia Hassam, Margaret McConnell and lan Duncan
and Charles McCormick Field Support Advisors (Auditors) attended Gorbals Post Office to conduct an
audit. They arrived at approximately 08.30 hours and introduced themselves to Rosemary Stewart,
Manager. Ms Stewart was informed they were there to perform an audit on behalf of Post Office Ltd.
Ms Stewart allowed them access to the secure area and was present while the audit was carried out. It
was noted one of the two safes was unlocked and Ms Stewart informed the Auditors it was faulty and
that no cash was kept in it. Stock Units were taken from the second safe one at a time and checked.
Once checked they were placed in a special delivery envelope and sealed. At approximately 10.00
hours Ms Hassam, Auditor noticed One Thousand pounds (£1,000) of £50 notes being placed in the safe
with the faulty lock by Mrs Jacqueline El Kasaby wife of the Subpostmaster who was now in attendance.
Ms El Kasaby was informed it would not be counted until after the audit. Ms Stewart then informed the
Auditors she had been covering up shortages caused by errors but could not tell them by how much.

Ms El Kasaby said was completely unaware that it had been happening. Mr El Kasaby, Subpostmaster
arrived at the branch at approximately 10.20 hours.

Cash and stock are held in a Stock Unit and allocated an identification letter/number i.e. AA or 1 etc.
Each Post Office Branch is unique in it’s make up off stock units. Whereas one office may have staff
sharing one Stock Unit, another may have each member of staff assigned to an individual Stock Unit.

Regardless of whether a member of staff serves from a shared or individual stock unit, each one will
have an individual User ID and password for the Horizon computer system.

All remaining Stock Units in the branch were checked resulting in an overall net shortage of Thirty Four
Thousand One Hundred and Seventy Nine pounds Fifty Four (£34,179.54) shortage. A breakdown of
the audit result and details of the audit findings are as follows:

Total Shortage

All losses and gains discrepancies have to be resolved at balance, or alternatively when a Transaction
Correction is received. The Subpostmaster has three options to resolve it. Make Good - Cash, Make
Good — Cheque or Settle Centrally. The Settle Centrally option is only available if the discrepancy is
£150 or over. If the Subpostmaster uses the cash or cheque option to make good a shortage they then
must put the value of the shortage in the drawer. By settling centrally the Subpostmaster is accepting
the error. They will then be contacted by a member of the Current Debt team within the Product &
Branch Accounting (PBA) Section. If they are unable to make full payment, a payment plan is put in
place where 25% is deducted each month from the Subpostmaster’s remuneration until the debt is
repaid. Alternatively if there is an overage the Subpostmaster is entitled to remove the value of the
overage.

The One Thousand Eight Hundred pounds (£1,800) outstanding debt had been previously been settled
centrally reducing the loss on the day of the audit to Thirty Two Thousand Three Hundred and Seventy
Nine pounds Fifty Four (£32,379.54). However it had not been repaid resulting in the money owed

to Post Office Ltd being Thirty Four Thousand One Hundred and Seventy Nine pounds Fifty Four
(£34,179.54).

Production Gorbals Audit Report 29th November 2012
Case papers were raised and passed to Robert Daily, Security Manager for enquiry.

Subpostmasters are contracted to provide services relating to Post Office business to customers. As
such they receive a monthly remuneration commensurate with the level of business conducted at the
branch. They are provided with a balance of cash and stock to allow them to provide these services. It
is their responsibility to ensure that this cash and stock is accounted for and is held securely at all times.
Subpostmasters are expressly forbidden by a clause in their contract to use Post Office money for their
own use.

All branches are required to balance and complete a Branch Trading Statement at the end of each
Branch Trading Period. It is a signed declaration of the cash and stock held at the branch at the end of
the Branch Trading Period, and is also is a summary of the volume and value of the receipt and payment
transactions, which have been carried out in the branch during the period on behalf of Post Office Ltd
and its clients. There are twelve Branch Trading Periods in a year, produced on a 4/5 week cycle and
running from April through to March. Each Period is identified by a number (TP 01, TP 02 etc) and starts
ona Thursday and ends on a Wednesday in each instance, unless either the Wednesday or Thursday
clashes with a public holiday, in which case, the Branch Trading Period is adjusted to take account of
this.

Within each Post Office there are counter position(s) which link into a computer system called Horizon.
Each Post Office is recognised by a unique code under which all their individual transactions are
recorded. The code for Gorbals Post Office is 224 844. This system records all transactions input by

a counter clerk working at a counter position against their individual office code. Each clerk will log

on to the system using his or her own User ID and unique password. The transactions performed by
each clerk, and the associated cash and stock level information are recorded by the Horizon system in

a stock unit. Once logged on, any transactions performed by the clerk must be recorded and entered
onto Horizon and are accounted for within the user's allocated stock unit. The Horizon system provides
a number of daily and weekly records of all transactions input into it. It enables Post Office users to
obtain computer summaries for individual clients of Post Office Ltd e.g. National Savings Bank, Girobank
(Alliance & Leicester), Department of Vehicle Licensing Association (DVLA) and the Department of Work
& Pensions (DWP). The Horizon system also enables the clerk to produce a weekly balance of cash
and stock on hand combined with the other transactions performed in that accounting period.

A Horizon User Id is compiled using the first letter of the first name and the first two letters of the
surname. Then a number is added, which will always be 001, unless there is, or has been, an identical

., For example: The first Elvis Presley to be a user in your office would take the user name

3 If there is a second Elvis Presley or an Ella Presley, the last number must be incremented

i n the Horizon system. If a user conducts management tasks such as
balancing the office and printing reports they would normally require at least 2 User Id’s. Therefore they
would use the same letter format and then accumulate the numbers e.g. 001, 002, 003, etc.

Mr Daily contacted Jacqueline El Kasaby and Rosemary Stewart and invited them to attend an audio
recorded interview under caution on Monday 28th January 2013 and Tuesday 29th January 2013
respectively. Mr Daily explained to Ms El Kasaby and Ms Stewart their legal rights and the concession
to have a friend present during the interview in accordance with Post Office rules. This was followed
up in writing to both with POLOO1 (Scotland) — Legal Rights and POL003 — Rights to a Friend at an
Interview or Search forms enclosed.

to bring the bill in the day before and left the money in the office overnight. Ms El Kasaby said it was Ms
Stewart who put the One Thousand pounds (£1,000) in the safe.

Ms El Kasaby stated she was unaware of the shortages in the office. She denied the theft of Post Office

Stewart confirmed her role as Manager and that she produced the Branch Trading Statement herself
with no assistance. Stewart confirmed Horizon passwords were not shared. Stewart said she received
quite a few Transaction Corrections but could recall any amounts.

A Transaction Correction (TC) is an electronic Error Notice that is issued through the Horizon system
to a branch when errors have been identified in the accounts for the office. The TC can be of both

a positive and negative nature, namely claim or charge respectively. If it is a claim the TC is in the
Subpostmaster’s favour and he is entitled to remove the amount from the Post Office funds. Ifitis a
charge then contractually he has to make good the amount by putting the money in to the Post Office
funds. When a charge TC is received the Subpostmaster has three options to resolve it. Make Good -
Cash, Make Good — Cheque or Settle Centrally.

Stewart was questioned about the day of the audit. She confirmed she phoned her sister and that when
she arrived she told her they would have a shortage but not how much. She stated when her sister told
her about the One Thousand pounds (£1,000) she thought she meant she could use it. Stewart admitted
reintroducing it and added that she didn’t know why she did because she knew it wouldn't cover what
was missing. Stewart added that she thought the shortage would be about Twenty Thousand pounds
(£20,000). She said the shortage was down to shortages at balance and Transaction Corrections.

Stewart was questioned about the Transaction Corrections. Stewart said when she received one she
would check it was for her office. She would then make it good to cash but not physically put the money
in. Stewart couldn't recall any amounts but they had received them for about 3 or 4 years. She added
that she wouldn't get any for a while then they'd get a number at the same time. Stewart said the largest
Transaction Correction she received was for a couple of thousand pounds in relation to cheques. She
said she couldn’t remember who cashed them. Stewart said if the Transaction Correction was for a
member of staff she would ask them if they knew anything about it and that was it. Stewart said she
made good the Transaction Corrections through her stock unit 4. She said when she declared her cash
in her stock unit she added the amount she was short to the unusable notes.

Stewart admitted she was being dishonest. She admitted when she did the Branch Trading Statement
she made the cash fit whatever the system was expecting.

Stewart denied using Post Office money for anything else

Stewart was shown Production Gorbals Audit Report 29th November 2012. She was questioned about
the Twenty Nine Thousand Nine Hundred and Forty Seven pounds Nine pence (£29,947.09) shortage
in the cash. Stewart said she received a phone call telling her she had a lot of money in unusable notes
and to send it back. She said she sent back some unusable notes but transferred the bulk of the notes
from stock unit 4 to stock unit ZZ. She initially said she completed the transfer on the day but later said
she transferred the money and wouldn't accept it till trading period end and then transfer it back.

In branches that have more than one stock unit, there is the facility on the Horizon System to record the
transfer of cash and items of stock that have physically been exchanged from one stock unit to another.
To do this you have to transfer out of one stock unit on Horizon and transfer in to another. The amount
of cash is then physically transferred between stock units. If the cash is not physically transferred
neither stock unit will balance with one being over and the other short. Stock units cannot balance and
rollover into the next trading period until all transfers out have been received by the “accepting” stock
unit. Cash cannot be transferred in until the supplying stock unit has transferred out. The amounts
must also agree. If cash is transferred out of a stock unit the cash is not accounted for in the branch

by Horizon until it is transferred in. The Office Snapshot shows will show the total cash in the branch.
However if a branch is holding Sixty Thousand pounds (£60,000) and a transfer of Thirty Thousand

~9-

pounds (£30,000) is done between stock units, if the transfer is not accepted the Office Snapshot will
only show Thirty Thousand pounds (£30,000) as being on hand.

Stewart denied stealing the money.

Stewart was shown Cash Declaration Stock Unit 04 printed 09.02 hours date 29/11/12 and the Balance
Snapshot Stock Unit 04 printed 09.01 hours date 29/11/12. The cash on both differed by approximately
Four Hundred pounds (£400). Stewart was asked if Horizon showed a variance when she did the cash
declaration. Stewart said she didn’t remember.

The branch is required to declare the cash on hand at the end of each day. When the cash is declared
Horizon will match it to what should be in the stock unit. If it differs a variance will show on the Horizon
screen. The Cash Declaration taken showed details the last declaration of cash that was made in Stock
Unit 04 prior to the audit.

Production Cash Declaration Stock Unit 04 printed 09.02 hours date 29/11/12

The Balance Snapshot details the cash and stock on hand that should be present in a stock unit at the
time it is printed, in addition to the business transacted through the branch during a 'said period’.

Production Balance Snapshot Stock Unit 04 printed 09.01 hours date 29/11/12

Stewart was shown the Tier 2 Audit - Cash Sheet for Stock Unit 04. She gave no explanation why the
cash was One Thousand Six Hundred and Eighteen pounds Seventeen pence short (£1,870.17)

A Tier 2 Audit - Cash Sheet is a hand written sheet that the Auditors complete as they check the cash

figures are corroborated.

Stewart was then shown the Cash Declaration for Stock Unit 04 taken on 29th November 2012 at 18.59
hours. This showed the actual physical cash Nine Thousand Five Hundred and Fifty Eight Ninety Eight
pence (£9,558.98) for Stock Unit 04. Stewart again gave no explanation why the cash was short.

Production Cash Declaration Stock Unit 04 printed 18.59 hours date 29/11/12

Stewart was again shown Balance Snapshot Stock Unit 04 printed 09.01 hours date 29/11/12. Stewart
was question about the Lottery Scratchcards, 634 x £1, 240 x £2 and 72 x £5, totalling approximately
One Thousand Four Hundred and Seventy Four pounds (£1,474.00). Stewart confirmed they didn’t exist.
She said she received a number of Transaction Corrections for Scratchcards and instead of removing
them from the system she left them on. Stewart added she knew if she removed them she would have
increased the cash resulting in a further cash shortage. She agreed by declaring the Scratchcards she
was disguising a further One Thousand Four Hundred and Seventy Four pounds (£1,474.00) shortage in
the cash.

Stewart was shown the Tier 2 Audit — Stock on Hand sheet for Stock Unit 04. Stewart agreed that no
Scratchcards were annotated on it.

about to disguise the shortage.

Stewart was informed that to do the balance the Auditors need to ensure all transfers are reconciled.
Stewart was shown pages 3 and 8 of the Transfer Reconciliation report printed 12.22 hours date
29/11/12. Page 8 showed Twenty Eight Thousand Six Hundred and Fifty Nine pounds Thirty Four
pence (£28,659.34) being transferred out and back in to Stock Unit ZZ on 15th November 2012. Page
3 showed two Transfers Out of Stock Unit 04 Twenty Eight Thousand Six Hundred and Sixty pounds
(£28,660.00) and Seven Hundred pounds (£700.00) on 15th November 2012 and the same amounts
being Transferred In to Stock Unit ZZ ON 29th November 2012. The Transfers In was accepted by the
Auditor. Stewart agreed the Seven Hundred pounds (£700.00) were probably unusable notes.

Stewart said when she received the phone call to return the unusable notes she was claiming around
Twenty Thousand pounds (£20,000) of them. Stewart said she sent what was unusable back and out
the rest of the amount she started switching between Stock Units 04 and ZZ.

The Transfer Reconciliation report details all transfers in the branch between stock units. It also details
if Transfers have been reconciled. The transfers in and out are also detailed on the Office Snapshot.

If they do not match the Auditor may reconcile all transfers prior to running the Transfer Reconciliation
report as was the case at the Gorbals audit.

Transfers. Stewart said there was never any physical cash in Stock Unit ZZ. She agreed the figures
were fictitious.

Stewart was shown the Office Snapshot Gorbals printed 08.59 hours date 29/11/12. The cash figure
was Fifty Nine Thousand One Hundred and Ninety Six pounds Eight pence (£59,196.08) and the

Nett discrepancy was a shortage of Fifteen pounds Twenty Two pence (£15.22). Stewart was then
shown the Office Snapshot Gorbals printed 08.59 hours date 29/11/12. The cash figure was Fifty Eight
Thousand Six Hundred and Sixteen pounds Forty Nine pence (£58,616.49) and the Nett discrepancy
was a shortage of Thirty Two Thousand Three Hundred and Seventy Nine pounds Fifty Four pence
(£32,379.54). Stewart agreed that the amounts of both snapshots were similar and that when the
transfers were accepted the cash should have been greater. Due to it not being there it produced a
shortage.

The last audit conducted at Gorbals Post Office was May 2009. Stewart said the shortages and
Transaction Corrections started right after the audit in May 2009. She said the phone call regarding the
unusable notes was a few months prior to the audit.

Stewart again denied stealing the money

Stewart said she never took any staff down the discipline route in relation to the shortages.

Ali made no admissions to the embezzlement of Thirty Two Thousand Three Hundred and Seventy Nine
pounds Fifty Four (£32,379.54) of Post Office monies.

A notebook entry of the master tape seal numbers was made.

Rosemary Stewart has neither denied embezzling Thirty Two Thousand Three Hundred and Seventy
Nine pounds Fifty Four (£32,379.54) of Post Office monies from Gorbals Post Office.

In her role as Manager Stewart was in a position of trust.

Stewart has disguised the embezzlement of Post Office monies by firstly inflating the unusable notes in
the office. After claiming to receive a phone call to return the unusable notes she hid the embezzlement
by transferring monies from Stock Units 04 to ZZ and vice versa. By doing so she was removing the
cash figure from the accounts and placing it in the ether. That amount of cash would then not be
accounted for in the branch by Horizon. At the trading period end all transfers had to be accepted
before the branch could balance. Stewart would accept the transfer into a Stock Unit and after rolling
the branch into the next trading period would transfer the cash back out of the stock unit. She further
inflated the Lottery Scratchcards figures to disguise a further shortage in the branch.
