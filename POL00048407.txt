HULL CROWN COURT - AWAITING SENTENCE

We write to confirm the outcome of the recent Plea and Case Management Hearing of the case
against Janet Skinner when the Royal Mail were represented by Ms Docherty of Counsel.
Also present at Court was our Legal Assistant, Mr D Warren.

Following discussions between your Head Office directly with Ms Docherty on the morning
of the Hearing, and indeed further discussions in conference at Court between Post Office
Investigator, Diane Matthews, Ms Docherty and our Mr Warren, it was agreed that an offer of
a Guilty plea to Count 2 on the Indictment would be an acceptable way of concluding this case

as it was unlikely that Count 1 (Theft) could be proved.

The Defendant went on to enter a Guilty plea to Count 2 and the case was adjourned in order
that a Pre Sentence Report can be provided within the next 3 to 4 weeks.

You instructed that an application under the Provisions of Section 18 of the Proceeds of Crime

Act 2002 be su

ited to the Court with a view to instigating confiscation proceedings.

The application was submitted to His Honour Judge Thorn QC who gave the following

Directions:-

1. Initial Defence response by 01/02/07
2. Prosecution statement by 30/03/07
3. Defence response by 28/04/07

The Court further directed that a confiscation Hearing date is to be fixed on the date of

sentence,

The Defendant was granted bail in the same terms as previously but with a postal residence
condition.

Unfortunately, the Court has not yet supplied us with a copy of the Section 18 Order but it is
anticipated that this document will be formally issued by the Court within the next few days.

Finally, you should be aware that Counsel for the Defendant, Skinner, Mr Richard Woolfall
stated in open Court that the Defendant Skinner has “no money”.

We trust this assists and should you require our attendance in this case upon sentence, no
doubt you will instruct us accordingly.

._We trust. this assists,

GRO I
