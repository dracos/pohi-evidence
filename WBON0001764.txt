Sorry I missed your call. I was watching West Ham and we were just on a impossible comeback.
I have dropped Tony a line about the calls and will get back to you.

I know that he is read in and has spoken To DC.

I will be in touch.

Apologies for my long VM on your mobile...essentially the Qs are:

WBONO0001763_0001

WBON0001764

1) Can Lord Grabiner QC be on a Post Office Board call at 5.15pm on Monday about the recusal issue ? Is
he read in enough ? Post Office are very wary of such an application and want a full discussion on it.

2) If LGQC can make the call on Monday then Lord Neuberger can be stood down from the possibility of
attendance on that call as Post Office have his views already via his helpful note. LGQC would be a fresh
perspective.

3) If LGQC can make the Monday call can he also me make a pre call with the GC of Post Office and me at
some point after lpm on Monday ?

4) Lastly, it may be that we send to you tomorrow a short draft note on the recusal issue so LGQC can
review and comment.

Tam aware that I still need to come back to you to press "go" on the longer LNQC work re appeal merits
generally. As soon as I have a "go" from the client I'll let you know. I don’t have that yet.

Many thanks
T
