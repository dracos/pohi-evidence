Hi Both,

This branch has been mentioned on the Wednesday morning call and as the history appears to date back a few months and
is before the ATOS change over I might need help.

It seems the original contact related to the keyboard attached to the AEI kit and may have predated the current Postmaster
whose FDOS was 12.12.13. The branch has since converted to Mains in March 2014.

I’ve attached the calls logged to NBSC for the past year and the investigation form following the call from branch on
04.07.14 along with the response(s) from Fujitsu in the further information document.

In Feb 2014 I had asked Phil Ashley and Sharon Brearley (now with ATOS formerly with Service Management) to look
into the problem with AEI and the keyboard as NBSC had escalated branch contact themselves and asked for some
support. I received the following response from Phil Ashley dated 20.02.14 & 21.02.14 respectively:-

“With reference to Wembley — the branch appears to be experiencing a known fault with the AEI equipment which is
being worked on by Fujitsu and 3M Cogent. The issue is around the KVM switch used to switch the keyboard between
the AEI and Horizon Terminal whereby the I key stops working/only works intermittently. This is being worked on by
both Fujitsu and 3M Cogent (who are organising for an engineer to visit to replace the switch again this week). We will
coring this branch to ensure the issue is resolved.”
“3M Cogent are currently dealing with this (engineer due today to swap out KVM Switch) and will advise branch on
progress regarding this incident. I will be contacting the branch next week to see if issue resolved and organise further
action if appropriate. As previously mentioned this is a known fault for which there is no current permanent solution
available but for which we can normal resolve via work around of replacing appropriate Horizon and 3M Cogent parts and
resitting cabling until fixed (this can however take some time to resolve).”

Could I suggest the following approach and let me know what you think please?

e An intervention visit to provide some assurance to the postmaster, check the any information on site and listen to
and gather the postmasters feedback? I expect this postmaster will be receiving support as post transfer and
conversion via the same FSA so have they any information on this please?

e Check with FSC to see if there are any TCs pending or anything that they may be able to help with from an
accounting point of view?

e Can Fujitsu provide any further information specifically around the fault and the engineers comments (25.02.14)
that in “His opinion the keyboards hadn’t been swapped”. It’s my understanding that this technical fault would
not cause losses so can Fujitsu confirm that this is the case?

e As Phil Ashley stated that 3m Cogent were also dealing with the fault in Feb 2014 would this have been logged
back anywhere into Fujitsu or will this now be back to IT supplier management and ATOS to see if they have any
saved information? (Shirley I’m not sure whether you have a route post ATOS change over if not just let me
know that?)

If either of you have any ideas yourselves please let me know? Otherwise once I hear form everyone Ill see how to take
this fwd.

Thanks
Anne
