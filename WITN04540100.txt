POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY

FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF JULIE WELSH

I, MRS JULIE WELSH, will say as follows:

INTRODUCTION

1. lam currently retired and have been since May 2020. I am not involved in the Horizon
project at present, and have had no involvement in it since around April 2007 when I
stopped working for Fujitsu Services Limited (“Fujitsu”).

2. This witness statement is made to assist the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry (the
“Inquiry”) with the questions put to me in a Rule 9 Request dated 4 January 2023 (the
“Request’). It is based on my direct knowledge of relevant matters. I was assisted in
preparing this statement by Morrison Foerster, who represent Fujitsu in the Inquiry.

3. The topics in the Request relate to events that took place at least 15 years ago. In
many cases, they relate to incidents that I had limited or only partial involvement with.
I have tried to remember these events as best I can but have not always been able to
do so.

4. Where I have seen documents relevant to the Inquiry’s Request for the purpose of

preparing this statement or where I have referred to documents, these documents are

Page 1 of 17

WITN04540100

referred to using references WITN0454_01/1 — WITN0454_01/17 and are listed in the
index accompanying this statement. To the extent that these documents have not
already been provided to the Inquiry, they are exhibited to this statement.

BACKGROUND

5. I joined Fujitsu (or, as it was then known, “ICL”) around September 1998.

6. Most of my professional experience before joining ICL was as a civil servant. I worked
in various roles in the civil service from 1972 to March 1998.

7. From around May 1995 to March 1998, I worked for the Department of Social Security
on what we called the “benefit card project”. I was asked to join the “benefit card
project” team as I had previously worked at a local benefits office processing benefits
claims. My role on the project was to provide input on the existing processes used at
those local offices. After ICL was awarded the bid to deliver the “benefit card project”,
I was seconded to ICL for about six months, where my role remained to provide input
on how existing local benefit office processes worked. I do not recall the precise dates
of my secondment. I left the civil service in March 1998.

8. Immediately prior to joining ICL, I worked at an orphanage for about 6 months in a
volunteer role, assisting the permanent staff with the daily care of the children.

9. My initial role when joining ICL was secretarial. I supported two sales managers who

worked on Girobank related matters.

10.Around March 2000, I was promoted and became a “service manager” on the Horizon
Service Helpdesk (“HSH”). I continued in this role until around April 2006. My role
involved:

a. Monitoring the HSH and the Service Management Centre for conformance to
service level targets (“SLTs”), ensuring the incident management process was
smooth, and completing monthly finance forecasts in conjunction with the
relevant service desk managers for each service to meet agreed budgets.

b. Acting as the primary point of contact for the Post Office (“POL”) NBSC on the
quality of the service, including, at times, updating them on open issues that
were being investigated as a result of HSH calls and responding to any
concerns they had. I recall my primary point of contact at the NBSC being
Richard Benton.

c. Investigating and responding to complaints about the HSH or Horizon, including
those raised by individual sub-postmasters (“SPMs”) and POL.

11.As a service manager, I initially reported to Reg Barton, and subsequently to Dave
Law.

12.My role was not a technical one. I have no technical training or background. While
my title was “service manager’, I did not have any overall management responsibility
for the service desk. My role was a support function for the HSH.

13.As part of my role, I reviewed entries on the Peak and PowerHelp systems. As a
result, I could sometimes observe certain trends in the calls coming into the HSH (for
example, a high volume of calls at the same time about a particular issue or persistent

calls from the same SPM). However, the identification of trends in calls coming into

Page 3 of 17
WITN04540100
WITN04540100

the HSH was not a part of my role, and I would not have been able to effectively do
that given my lack of technical experience or training. There was a separate team
within the HSH, called the service control team, that identified recurring themes and
trends that may require escalation.

14.1 left my permanent position at Fujitsu in April 2006, but returned in October or
November 2006 on a temporary contract. While I was working on the Post Office
account when I returned, it was not in my previous role as a service manager. Instead,
I worked in an administrative support role. I left this role in around April 2007 and
have not worked for Fujitsu since.

HORIZON SYSTEM HELPDESK — INCIDENT REPORTING AND MANAGEMENT OF

COMPLAINTS
HSH Effectiveness
15.1 have been asked how effective the HSH was at:
a. assisting Horizon users;
b. escalating issues to Fujitsu (which I understand to mean the more senior
technical team at third line support, as the HSH was part of Fujitsu); and
c. escalating incidents as problems.
16.As noted at paragraph 12 above, my role was not a technical one and I had no
technical training or background. As a result, I am unable to evaluate the quality of
the advice given by the HSH or to assess whether the HSH was effective at assisting
users in the sense of providing correct technical advice. I am also unable to say

whether the HSH operators were well-trained for their roles.

Page 4 of 17
WITN04540100
WITN04540100

17.However, from my perspective as a service manager, I believed the desk was effective
at meeting the service standards required by POL. This is based on my recollection
that the HSH picked up calls in a timely manner and had a high resolution rate. As
part of my role, I would obtain HSH performance statistics from the service desk
manager and check if they met the desk’s SLTs. I would share these figures with
Richard Brunskill, who was involved in preparing the Service Review Books (“SRBs”),
and occasionally would explain or discuss the desk’s performance with him. Having
reviewed the SRB for April 2003 (WITN0454_01/1), I recall that it would have been my
role to collate the data for the types of statistics at sections 3.2 and 6, and I would
have worked in conjunction with Richard Brunskill to prepare those sections in the
SRBs.

18.While it was not a formal part of my role, I would also look out for repeat calls from the
same branch or individual, so as to ensure that the person calling got the right support.
In most cases, that would involve additional training for the SPM, which I would raise
with POL as they administered that training. An example where I identified a repeat
caller and escalated the case for a field visit is PCO062561 (WITN0454_01/2).

19.In relation to the escalation of issues up the support hierarchy, I am unable to comment
as I was not involved in such escalation decisions. These decisions were made by
the technical staff operating the HSH and answering calls. It was also not my role to
monitor escalated cases, unless a complaint was raised. This was monitored by
others on the HSH.

20.1 reviewed WITN0454_01/3, WITN0454_01/4, and WITN0454_01/5 to further

understand and refresh my memory of the problem identification and management

Page 5 of 17
WITN04540100
WITN04540100

process. Having done so, I can recall that I was not involved in identifying or
escalating problems. I therefore cannot say whether the relevant processes were
effective. I believe it would ordinarily have been the HSH duty manager who did this.
My understanding is that if a trend was observed by HSH operators, they would
escalate that to the duty manager who would decide whether it was a problem that
required further management.

21.1 would usually be informed of any incident. However, I would not be involved in
evaluating, escalating or managing the incident, as that would be done by individuals
who had the relevant technical skills.

Complaints

22.1 had responsibility for managing any complaints about the HSH service or about
Horizon that originated from Horizon users. While this is something I had primary
responsibility for, it was not the focus of my role. My primary task, and on which I
spent the most amount of my time, was on monitoring the service levels of the HSH.

23.1 reviewed WITN0454_01/6 and WITN0454_01/3 to refresh my memory of the
complaints process. I can recall that there were a number of sources of complaints
from Horizon users. These included the NBSC, the HSH itself, feedback cards
following engineer visits, as well as complaints that were sent to Fujitsu directly. In
most cases, I recall that complaints were received by me in writing.

24.From reviewing section 3.1 of WITN0454_01/6, I recall that the first step followed after
receiving a complaint was to determine if it was a complaint that was proper for Fujitsu
to deal with. While I do not have a clear memory of this process, I recall that I would

usually treat as proper any complaint that related to an area that Fujitsu managed or

Page 6 of 17
WITN04540100
WITN04540100

had responsibility for. If a complaint had to do with a process that was owned by POL,
I would acknowledge the complaint and forward it to the NBSC.

25.As stated in WITN0454_01/6 and WITN0454_ 01/3, if a complaint was related to Fujitsu,
an acknowledgement letter would be sent to the person who had complained within
24 hours of receipt. It was my responsibility to prepare and send the
acknowledgement letters.

26.1 would then also log the complaint. I do not remember exactly how complaints were
logged or tracked. WITN0454_01/6 states that there was a complaints database on
PowerHelp, and I recall that I may have forwarded details of complaints to the service
control team, who would add these to PowerHelp. I think I may also have used
PowerHelp to pull any required statistics about complaints (such as the number of
open complaints or the complaint type).

27.1 would then proceed to look into the complaint. Complaints could be about a myriad
of issues. These included allegations of rudeness by field engineers or HSH staff,
unhappiness with the layout of particular screens on the Horizon terminal, or very
general statements that the system simply “wasn’t working properly”.

28.1 usually started by reviewing the call history of the individual who made the complaint
(on PowerHelp or Peak), so as to understand the issues they had raised before and
how they were dealt with. The approach I then took to manage and close the
complaint would depend on the nature of the complaint. For example:

a. Ifa complaint was about a Fujitsu employee’s conduct (on the phone or at the
branch), I would identify the relevant logs or reports about the incident and

forward those to the relevant person’s manager for review and feedback. When

Page 7 of 17
WITN04540100
WITN04540100

a decision was taken by the manager on the steps that would be taken as a
result of the complaint, I would report that back to the person who had
complained.

b. If a complaint related to a technical issue, I would consider the call history and
the conclusion reached by the technical teams previously. I would also usually
discuss the case with the third line support team to confirm if it should be further
escalated or if there was technical advice to be given. If it was decided there
was no technical issue, I would inform the individual who complained and,
depending on the case, may refer them for further training with POL.

29.1 would not generally respond to a complaint without first checking the relevant issues
with someone who had responsibility for the subject matter of the complaint, and my
manager would generally supervise my responses to complaints.

30.Complaints were monitored and discussed at regular meetings between the HSH and
the NBSC. Having reviewed Section 9 of WITN0454_ 01/7, I recall that these meetings
were the NBSC/HSH Review Forum. I would usually attend these meetings with my
manager. I have a clear recollection of attending with Dave Law, but expect Reg
Barton would have attended when he was my manager as well. They would usually
take the lead in the discussions, and I would support them where needed (e.g. by
preparing figures for the number of open complaints). While I do not recall all of the
POL attendees at these meetings in detail, I have a clear recollection that the meetings
usually included Sandra Evans from the NBSC. My recollection is that the agenda for

the meetings would usually follow the template at Section 9.2 of WITN0454_01/7.

WITN04540100
WITN04540100

31.1 had primary responsibility within the HSH for managing complaints and, in my view,
I did so effectively. I did my best to resolve each complaint as best I could for the
individual who was complaining. In particular, I made it a point not to simply write off
complaints as an error by the user, but to try to understand the full issue.

32.1 am not able to comment on POL’s internal complaint process, as I was not involved
with it. However, when I worked with them on complaints that had originated on the
HSH, I formed the impression (based on my own observations and conversations with
SPMs) that POL’s staff took a less sympathetic approach towards the SPMs than I did
and did not always take SPM complaints seriously.

5 JANUARY 2004 NETWORK BANKING OUTAGE AND 16 FEBRUARY 2004

HORIZON ONLINE OUTAGE

33. The Inquiry has asked me various questions regarding a network banking outage on
5 January 2004 and a Horizon Online outage on 16 February 2004. I have no
recollection of either of these incidents.

34.1 have reviewed WITN0454_01/8 and WITN0454_ 01/9, but these have not assisted me
with improving my recollection of the incidents. I note I am listed as a contributor on
WITN0454_01/8 regarding the 5 January 2004 incident. However, looking at the report
now, I do not understand why that would have been the case and I also cannot identify
any aspects of the report I might have contributed to.

35.1 do not recall what SPMs were told about these incidents or if I was involved in
communicating with SPMs about any aspect of these incidents.

36.In general, during major outages, a script would have been prepared for HSH

operators to use when they received calls from SPMs regarding the incident. I recall

Page 9 of 17
WITN04540100
WITN04540100

being asked to prepare scripts on some occasions. The scripts I prepared would
usually just be a simple response telling SPMs that Fujitsu was aware of the issue and
the relevant technical teams were working on a solution. If any technical content was
required, the script would have been written by someone with a technical background
working on the issue, usually someone in third line support or the duty manager.

37.As a result of my limited recollection and my non-technical background, I am not able
to comment on the effect of these failures on the service provided by Fujitsu to POL,
as the Inquiry has asked me to do.

38.The Inquiry has specifically asked me to consider how effectively Fujitsu
communicated to POL about the 5 January 2004 incident. I do not recall any aspects
of Fujitsu’s communication with POL about this incident, and so am unable to
comment. I have reviewed WITN0454_01/8, and note that there was some criticism
about the delay in informing POL of the incident on page 12 of the document.
However, that has not assisted me in recalling any details.

39.Given the seriousness of the 5 January 2004 incident (as suggested by
WITN0454_01/8), I would not expect to have been personally involved in
communicating with POL about it. In such cases, communication with POL would
have been the responsibility of more senior members of the team, and those with
technical knowledge. I would have expected Mike Woolgar (who is listed as one of
the originators of WITN0454_01/8) to have been the primary point of contact for POL.
I also note that Dave Hulbert (who worked at POL and was listed as being on the
external distribution of WITN0454_01/8) was usually a point of contact for duty

managers. I did not have any regular contact with him.

WITN04540100
WITN04540100

PEAKS

40.1 have considered each of the Peaks the Inquiry has referred me to. In one case, the
Inquiry has referred me to a PowerHelp record rather than a Peak. Generally, I do not
recall the specific issues or incidents raised by these documents.

41.Due to my role as a service manager, I had access to the Peak system to review
escalated calls and follow up on any actions assigned to me in relation to a Peak.
However, I did not use the Peak system regularly as part of my job. Instead, I mainly
used the PowerHelp system to review calls.

42.\n addition, my recollection is that I had “read-only” access to the Peak system, and
that I could not create or modify Peaks. I acknowledge that the Inquiry has provided
me with three Peaks where I am listed as a “user” making entries (WITN0454_01/10,
WITN0454_01/11, WITN0454_01/2). I expect that I would have provided the
information contained in those entries, but I do not recall those specific Peaks or
directly making any entries into the Peak system. My recollection is that if it was
necessary for me to update a Peak, I would inform someone on the service control
team, and they would make any updates for me.

43.1 would also like to make some observations about some of the specific Peaks the
Inquiry has referred me to:

a. In Peaks PC0098230, PC0130275, and PowerHelp Call E-0402251077
(WITN0454_ 01/12, WITN0454_01/13, WITN0454_01/14), I was asked to contact
or follow up with POL about the issues raised in the Peaks. If I was asked to
communicate a matter to POL, I would do so. I would usually have done that

by informing Richard Benton, who was my main point of contact at POL.

Page 11 of 17
WITN04540100
WITN04540100

b. In PC0093382 WITN0454_01/10, I noted that a Peak should be closed. While
I do not recall this Peak or the incident it relates to, I would not generally have
asked for a Peak to be closed independently. I expect I would have done so
on the instruction of someone else in the HSH or third line support.

44.Most of the Peaks the Inquiry has referred me to relate to balancing issues or
accounting discrepancies. I was aware, at a very general level, that SPMs often
experienced difficulties with balancing. The HSH would get a high number of
balancing related calls on the days when SPMs had to balance their accounts.
However, I was not usually kept updated if there were any trends identified which
might show a problem with Horizon. When balancing issues were escalated to third
line support, I would not usually be kept informed about the details of the resolution
and I would not have been part of the support team’s discussions.

45.1 did not, at any point while employed at Fujitsu, regard the complaints made by SPMs
as indicative of system-wide issues with Horizon. I had this view because:

a. The complaints received from SPMs and that I handled were very wide ranging.
As I explain above, while some of them related to discrepancies or potential
technical issues with Horizon, many others were about issues such as
allegations of rudeness by field engineers or HSH staff, or unhappiness with
the layout of particular screens on the Horizon terminal.

46.1 believed at the time that if there really were system wide issues, all SPMs would have
been affected. However, the volume of calls/complaints we were receiving did not

suggest that. Instead, it suggested that only a subset of SPMs was having difficulties.

Page 12 of 17
WITN04540100
WITN04540100

My impression was that Horizon was a complex system, operating at thousands of
Post Office branches, and that it was working well for the majority of SPMs.

47.I continued to hold this view about the system at the point I left Fujitsu. On hindsight,
my view above may have been naive and based on my own lack of technical
understanding about how problems could affect the Horizon system.

48.1 believe the confidence I had in Horizon was shared by my colleagues on the HSH
and those I dealt with at POL, and I do not recall anyone raising concerns of system-
wide problems. However, I cannot comment on others’ beliefs and why they may have
held them.

49.On a number of occasions, calls would be closed on the basis that the relevant SPM
required further training. I recall that it was a commonly held view on the HSH that, in
most cases when SPMs called in, they were usually facing difficulties because they
were not using the system correctly. From my perspective at the time, this was a
reasonable view to have. A full investigation would often be done by third line support
where a call could not be resolved at earlier stages, and if they determined there was
no technical problem, the natural conclusion would be that the SPM was making a
mistake.

50.In retrospect, it’s clear that some SPMs were facing issues because of technical
problems with Horizon, and it would have been wrong to say that the issues they faced
were due to insufficient training.

51.1 have been asked to comment on whether there is anything Fujitsu could have done
differently in respect of complaints raised by Horizon users. From my perspective,

and in relation to my role, I believe I managed each complaint thoroughly with the aim

Page 13 of 17
WITN04540100
WITN04540100

of resolving them satisfactorily. I would not now approach my role differently. In doing
my job, I often had to rely on the expertise of others, including technical experts. Given
my lack of technical knowledge, I am not in a position to say whether they should have
approached their roles differently.

EMAIL OF 5 MAY 2004 AND CASTLETON LITIGATION

52. The Inquiry has drawn my attention to:

a. WITN0454_01/15, which is an email I sent to Richard Benton at POL dated 5
May 2004 (the “5 May 2004 Email”); and

b. the fact that the email was of importance to POL in the litigation between Mr
Lee Castleton and POL and that it was referred to in two witness statements
made on behalf of POL by Ms Catherine Oglesby (WITN0454_01/16 and
WITN0454_01/17).

53.1 do not remember sending the 5 May 2004 Email. The 5 May 2004 Email contains
some analysis by Anne Chambers regarding financial discrepancies at a particular
Post Office branch. My role in sending the 5 May 2004 Email would have been simply
to forward Anne’s conclusions to POL, and I did so by quoting her words directly from
the relevant PowerHelp record (E-0402251077, which is at page 21 of
WITN0454_01/14). 1 did not make my own enquiries of the relevant discrepancies
independent of Anne’s analysis.

54.1 also do not recall ever being tasked with investigating financial discrepancies on the
Horizon system. I would not have had the technical ability or understanding of the
system to undertake such tasks. I may, on occasion, have received a complaint about

financial discrepancies from POL or an SPM. In those cases, I would have reviewed

Page 14 of 17
WITN04540100
WITN04540100

the relevant PowerHelp or Peak records to understand previous investigations into the
issue and would have discussed the case with the relevant technical teams, so as to
prepare a response. I would not have been directly involved in investigating the
underlying technical reason for the discrepancy.

55. Until I received the Request on 4 January 2023, I was not aware that my role at Fujitsu
and the 5 May 2004 Email were of importance to POL in the High Court claim brought
against them by Mr Castleton. To the best of my knowledge, I was never contacted
by POL or any lawyers working on their behalf about Mr Castleton’s case.

56. In both Ms Oglesby’s witness statements, the following statement from the 5 May 2004

email is extracted:
“There is no evidence whatsoever of any system problem ... please tell the PM
that we have investigated and the discrepancies are caused by the difference
between the transactions they have recorded on the system and the cash they
have declared, and are not being caused by the software or hardware.”

57.Those reading Ms Oglesby’s statements may have had the impression that that
statement was made by me. That impression is not correct. The statement is Anne
Chambers’, and I was merely quoting from her in the 5 May 2004 Email.

Statement of Truth

I believe the content of this statement to be true.
