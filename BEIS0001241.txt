E: Fixed Term Interim Payments - Minister Response

HiJack,

Thank you for the readout below.

Here are the stats requested on interim payments on the HSS:

325 individuals have received interim payments (IPs)

520 IPs have been made in total (some individuals have received more than one interim payment)
83 IPs have been issued prior to an offer being made

437 IPs have been made following an offer

£37.12m has been paid out in interim payments (£1.47m pre-offer and £35.65m post offer)

We will follow up separately on the Chris Head point.

Many thanks,
Harry

Dear Carl, and all,

Just to confirm in writing following the meeting yesterday on fixed term interim payments,

Minister Thomas is happy not to proceed with offering the interim £50k to postmasters unwilling to accept the £75k
fixed sum, given that the Post Office are already paying out to some on a hardship basis, in order to speed up
getting compensation payments out to those affected.

However, the Minister is keen to see numbers on the PO's hardship payemnts and any cases that could be shared

The Minister is also keen for a better understanding of what Chris Head raised with him about those requiring legal
assistance to get their evidence in order, and whether they need assistance to complete the claim.

Could you get me an answer to these points?
Best wishes,

Jack
