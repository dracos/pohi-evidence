Dear Jonny,

Do you have a simple list of the issues on which we are proposing to prepare evidence — which identifies all
the issues on which Rob has requested evidence? Your table of 27/10 does not seem to do that. Incidentally,
does it definitely cover all the paras from Coyne that anyone has suggested that we need to deal with?

Best wishes,

Tony

Dear Tony,

Thank you for your comments — I have passed them on to Robert.

The process for deleting KELs is set out in “SVM/SDM/PRO/0875 End to End Application Support Strategy” section
11.2.5 “KEL deletion” and “SVM/SDM/STP/3289 Terms of Reference for POA KEL Approval Forum” which includes in
its remit, section 1.1: “That issue, time or service expired KEL’s are retired or archived (deactivated)”. Those
documents have been disclosed, but we don't know if Coyne has read them. We are exploring whether FJ can
retrieve the deleted KELs.

I've attached the current version of our witness evidence plan. We will update it on Monday to catch anything in the
documents you refer to below that isn't already covered.

Dear Jonny,

Further to my email of last night with my and Simon’s comments on Rob’s updated summary of opinions, I
enclose our comments on the following documents:

1. Rob’s alternative formulation of the main analysis.
2. Rob’s analysis of KELs in the Coyne report.
3. Rob’s financial impact of all bugs v3.

I am troubled to discover that all records for some KELs have been destroyed (and I see that Rob is, too).
Not only does it suggest a distressingly casual approach to maintaining the system, it also seems to
undermine at least some of Rob’s quantitative analyses. It is far from ideal that those analysis already
depend on some important assumptions that could be said to be arbitrary. If the destroyed KELs problem
requires further such assumptions to be made, these analyses will be even easier to attack. On top of these
difficulties, I worry that we are only discovering that KELs have been destroyed now and that, even now,
Coyne may not know about this. Is that the position?

We will no doubt be discussing this next week.

WBD_000499.000002
WBON0000629

A further important question that arises from Rob’s documents is whether Rob has properly considered
whether and to what extent the points that he derives from the documents he has seen in fact require witness
or other evidence to substantiate them. This is not an easy thing for an expert to do: it is usually what
litigators are for.

If we had time, we would wait and see what Rob’s final report is going to look like, we would identify the
various factual inferences and assumptions on which it is based and we would then work out whether the
existing documents bearing on those assumptions and inferences are sufficient to demonstrate their veracity
or whether further evidence is needed to substantiate them (whether in the form of witness evidence or
further disclosure). However, we do not have time to do this. This makes us more dependent on Rob’s
judgments on these questions than we would like to be.

These judgments are hard for Rob to make and, given the relatively small amount of Coyne paras which Rob
has identified as requiring evidence (in his further evidence required document), I think it would be helpful
for someone to draw up a table briefly identifying the issues on which anyone thinks that evidence may be
required. That table could then be used as the basis for a discussion with Rob early next week.

Could someone at WBD produce the first draft? In the first instance, that person could produce a table
which organises in a coherent way and briefly describes the issues covered by the following references or
paras:

1. all references to “evidence” in the documents attached to this email and to my email of yesterday
(including in particular the references in the comments Simon and I have added to those documents);

2. all the Coyne paras referred to in Rob’s document entitled “further evidence required”; and

3. the following additional Coyne paras: 3.6 last sentence, 3.16 last sentence, 3.21 last sentence, 3.23 last
sentence, 3.24 first sentence, 5.11, 5.27, 5.30 last sentence, 5.40, 5.75, 5.76, 5.113, 5.176, 5.180,
5.183, 5.185, 6.3-4, 6.47, 6.64 second sentence, 6.65 first sentence, 6.66 last sentence, 6.68, 6.69, 6.71
first sentence, 7.1, 7.28, 7.31, 7.36-7, 7.41 first and second sentences, 7.42, 8.21, 9.10, 9.17, 9.22,
9.25, 9.44, 9.61, 9.67, 9.70 last sentence, 9.71, 9.72 and 9.73

This will be a laborious job but if done with intelligence and concision it could save the whole team a great
deal of time and considerably improve the quality of the decisions ultimately made as to the evidence we
should serve. Needless to say, the table would not address the quandary we face in relation to the lead
claimants’ evidence for the common issues trial (other than Stubbs’ evidence of kiosk operations problems
referred to in Coyne para 5.27). In relation to that evidence, I share Simon’s view that it would be difficult to
make any decision until we know what we have seen all the evidence that Post Office can call on all the
difficulties the lead claimants say they faced when operating their branches.

Best wishes,

Tony

Dear Jonny,

T enclose Rob’s updated summary of opinions, with comments both from Simon and from me. Simon’s
comments are all short, to the point and well made. Mine are more discursive, less narrow and some of them
probably proceed on the basis of some misconceptions on my part. The idea is to make Rob aware of
possible lines of attack and to get him thinking about how to deal with them — perhaps with more
documentary or witness evidence.

The points on which I would most welcome Rob’s thoughts are those I raises in AdGR4, 9, 17, 26, 29, 50
and 69. I'd also be very interested to know his answers to the questions I pose in AdGR 25, 38, 40 and 41.

I will let you have comments on Rob’s other documents tomorrow.

I wonder whether it would be helpful for Rob and us to have a telecon about our comments early next week,
before Rob finalises and releases his sections 7 and 8?

Best wishes,

Tony

Please find attached:-

. further evidence that Robert has requested following on from JC's report
2. an updated summary of opinions (will be section 2 of his report), which contains this new material (you were
requested with an earlier version of this under cover of my email below):
a. In 1.2.5, a first answer to your request for the impact of Horizon bugs on an individual claimant; and
b. In 1.6, Robert's initial response to Coyne's report, and his approach to writing this report or deferring to
the supplemental report;
3. an alternative way to present the main analysis, which is planned to be section 8.4 - after the presentation you
already have — and a request for additional evidence in relation to that analysis; and
4. Robert's preliminary analysis of the KELs cited by Coyne.

Robert is keen to receive feedback on the attached, either by email or on a call. Please would you let me know which
you'd prefer and when you're free.

Kind regards

Tony, Simon,

Please find attached:-

1. a paper clarifying Robert's previous analysis of the financial impact of Horizon bugs that he has produced
following our call on 21 September;

WBD_000499.000005

2. Robert's current summary of opinions section 2 , to provide context to assess the note on the main analysis of
bugs; and

3. an updated version of our table about the references to Horizon issues in the Claimants’ witness evidence with
a new column noting references to those issues in Coyne's report.

While the focus of today's call is Coyne's report it would be useful to cover the impact of bugs analysis if we have time.

Kind regards

Jonny
