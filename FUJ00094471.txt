1. Tracking Summary

Measurable Comments

TIME The Horizon Online continues to run operationally in 144 branches.

Further to the incidents experienced at the beginning of March, a
decision was made to halt further pilot migrations while the issues
are investigated, fixed and a period of stability observed.

Fujitsu are now providing evidence to POL which indicates an
improvement in stability, and therefore the pilot has been scheduled
to re-start this week (as agreed by the POL Internal Release
Authorisation Board on 17th March).

A further decision will be made next week as to whether to enter
High Volume pilot; the key current concern being the ability of the
HSD to cope with the projected volume of calls. The average
number of calls per Horizon Online Branch remains significantly
higher than that of the Horizon branches and the concern remains
that the HSD will fail to cope with a significant increase in migrated
branches.

The end date of rollout has already gone back into June. However;
although opportunities do exist to bring this earlier the current level
of ongoing problems suggests this may be an optimistic position.

The final rollout profile continues to be assessed by the Programme
and Service teams and remains subject to approval by the Internal
and Joint Release Authorisation Boards.

COST

Reverted to Amber (from Green) due to likely over-run of
programme and additional costs incurred.

QUALITY 1. Screen Freezes, Re-boots and Recoveries. The rate of

screen freezes and recoveries has been greater than expected
and needs to reduce rapidly in order to extend rollout.
Improvements have occurred since a number of fixes were
applied over the last 2 weekends, but this continues to be
monitored and further improvements sought.

2. User opinion [no change]. Some goodwill has been lost
following the outages experienced at the beginning of March
and also due to continued changes to migration dates. We have
not yet “lost” the frontline, but are continuing to meet with
stakeholders to proactively manage the situation.

3. Number of calls to, and Level of support from HSD. The rate
of calls from Horizon Online branches is significantly higher than
from Horizon branches, and level of support received has been
poor in some cases. If the rate of calls does not significantly
reduce the HSD will not be able to cope when full rollout
commences.

4. Live System Test (LST): Work is now focused on testing

5. issues arising from Pilot to enable Medium Volume Pilot and
HVP to progress further. 2 Factor has now been signed-off.
Quality of products into LST is not as it should be which is
leading to more hot fixes than expected.

6. HNG Volume Testing. Phase 2 of Volume testing is under
increasing pressure to maintain the target completion date of
22/03. There are still a number of significant issues that require
urgent resolution.

Key

¢ Over 70% of the network now has Branch Router installed

Achievements I e POL-FS successfully migrated over the weekend of 6/7 March

« Data Centre Upgrades (RO1.08 and Red Hat) have improved the stability of
the system.

2.1 Issues and risks / Items for Discussion

NEW ITEMS FOR DISCUSSION :

Release 01.08 deployment.

Future Maintenance Releases — Timing, content and options to re-open the counter
migration package

SECURITY - position against Acceptance Incidents notably Patch Management
SECURITY — progress of PCI audit (repeat)

Management information to assess pilot issues and progress.

EXISTING ITEMS FOR DISCUSSION:

Progress on assessment of high incidence of Screen Freezes, Recoveries and Re-
boots

Progress against other areas of “action plan” to re-start pilot
Management of live issues; responsiveness and reporting.

Position on Volume Testing ahead of Rollout : Target exit date of Cycle 2 under
pressure.

Progress on erroneous “zeros” in client files: Including the maintenance of “manual
checks”

Contention for SV+I rig between HNG release 1 and release 2. LST has become a
bottleneck: update on position

Validation of performance during pilot : update on position
