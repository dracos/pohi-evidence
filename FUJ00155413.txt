1.0 Scope of Document

This document defines the process to be followed by the operational security team to meet its
obligations under RS/POL/002 Horizon Security Policy and CS/SER/016 the Service
Description for the Security Management Service and applies to Horizon only.

This process is concerned with those actions that the operational security team yndertake, all
other processes, guidelines and work instructions are outside the remit of Kg document,
although a historical background has been included to assist in establishing who Ng what is
required to enable us to establish this process going forward.

collected apMMyximately “a million events per day occurred, if such events are excluded then
there were about 150,000.

All events collected by Tivoli are initially buffered for about 1 hour and are available for
view, and these details are then sent to the archive server to ensure that rules of evidence are
maintained.

A summarised version of the events is maintained online for approximately 10 days and
analysis of availability events is undertaken by SMC. This summary removes all background

noise (redundant, repetitive and uninteresting events) and only events identified as interesting
are retained.

From a security perspective, only log on and log off data is retained as no requests or analysis
has been made for any other requirements and these are therefore seen as background noise.

If an increase in the Event collection of Security events is required as shown in section 4.0
then it must be noted that the volume of data collected and the capacity ofthe platform
holding this information (disk space and memory) and software revision use manage and
analyse it are key. The current Tivoli version in Horizon is Framework 3,71 and Wg and the
Oracle Server storing the data may also need upgrading, both of which ING-

monitoring the areas of service it is required to provide. On initial investigation this again
mainly covers the area of availability.

dependent on the following

of failures is available.

h. SI designs ensure that Central Collection platform (or platforms assuming
resilience is required) has sufficient storage capacity for log storage based on
the retention requirements defined in Fujitsu Services Horizon Security and

3.1 Horizon Security and Control Framework

In the absence of a Horizon Security Framework the principles adopted by other Fujitsu
Service Account Security Frameworks (e.g. NHS), have been provided by the CISO and will
be adopted until one is ready for Horizon and HNG-X and their key points are documented
below to provide a background to this process.

The overall frameworks is split into manageable areas that are in line with Sgvurity Policy
sections,

This comprises five main work strands and twenty separate task areas, or conty

Event Audit is part of the overall control framework and cannot be considered in isolation in
