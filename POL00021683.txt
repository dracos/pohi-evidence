Dear Sirs,
Breach of confidence
j refer to our letter of 27 July 2015.

In our letter we set out the confidentiality and publicity restrictions under your Engagement
Letter dated 1 July 2014 and the extension of your services under the Agreement to Complete
Work dated 15 April 2015 (together, both documents form your Engagement Terms).

These restrictions survive termination of both the Engagement Letter and Agreement to
Complete Work and continue to bind Second Sight. They apply to all aspects of your Services.
Details of your Services form part of the Confidential Information that Second Sight has
committed to keep strictly confidential and is also expressly covered by the publicity restriction at
clause 8.1 of your Engagement Terms.

Despite this, it is evident that our letter of 27 July 2015, or its substance, passed from you directly
or via an intermediary to Andrew Bridgen MP. As you were the only recipient of our 27 July
letter, it can only be inferred you disclosed the letter, in breach of your confidentiality and
publicity obligations. Please let us know immediately if this conclusion is incorrect and if so why.

Equally evident is that you have been writing to Ministers about your work as stated in the article
published by the Telegraph on 2 August 2015 (http://www, telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/royel-
mail/11778288/Post-Office-under-fire-over-IT-system.html). We also understand that your Ron
Warmington has spoken to Mark Andrews at the Shropshire Star to confirm the story in the
Telegraph,

You are not entitled to pass on our correspondence or communicate with third parties, including
the media, about your engagement. Our consent to you sharing information with James
Arbuthnot under the Side Letter dated 1 July 2014 was revoked by our letter of 10 March 2015
and you have no standing consent to contact any other Members of Parliament.

In connection with any and all disclosures you have made concerning your engagement, please
provide by return:

The correspondence requested above concerns your Services and is covered by clause 6.1.4 of
your Engagement Terms. Second Sight is therefore contractually obliged to provide this
information to Post Office.

Your breach of confidence is also a breach of the Code of Ethics for the Institute of Chartered
Accountants in England and Wales. Should you not fully comply with the above, we reserve our
right to report you to ICAEW, and if necessary pursue legal action through the Court, to ensure
your compliance with your contractual obligations.

For the avoidance of doubt, this letter is also confidential and must not be disclosed to any third
party.

engagement is now finished, please remove this webpage.
