RDING AN ON GOING PROBLEM

15.02.06 — Spoke to Alan Brown, he wanted to let me know that he has had another
problem with his system. I asked if he had reported this to the Helpdesk and he said
that he had.

Alan will continue to log a call each time he has a
problem. I told him that this would help to build a
case for having the alleged faulty kit exchanged.
