Hi Mark,

Thanks for this. Understood and agreed re your para. 1 (i.e. this additional work was triggered by both issues). Re
your para. 2, we need to understand the audit store checks in relation to non-Counter transactions. As things stand
we don't really get the header / footer point so it needs to be described in more detail and then tested to see whether
(i) it actually offers some protection against errors/tampering and (ii) it is actually used in practice.

Thanks

Jonny

Sorry I should have been clearer in my phrasing - I meant for my bracket to apply to the whole
sentence that preceded not just the second half.

To try and be as clear as possible - Counter transactions have integrity checking built in from initiation
to Audit Store. By contrast non-counter have no built in integrity checks from initiation through to Audit
Store, beyond the discrete control points we have started the journey of trying to understand.

Thanks Mark.

I think that the trigger for this additional piece of work was non-Counter transactions being more vulnerable to
tampering once on the BRDB, but I'll discuss with Andy to clarify. I'll also speak to him about the controls when pulled
from the audit store piece, as I recall that we didn’t think this was covered in the original report.

Noted re the SOW.

Thanks

Hi Jonny,

Yes that is our understanding - they follow the same data flow from that point on as counter initiated
transactions, but they don’t have the protection of JSNs etc, meaning they are more vulnerable to
tampering once on the BRDB and in the process flows beforehand (which I believe was the trigger
behind this additional piece of work).

I don’t think Phase 2 will cover the controls when pulled from the audit store as there is no difference
to counter initiated transactions in that regard (i.e. we’ve already looked at this).

We haven't issued the summary of the call yet, but will do shortly (and will include you on the
distribution). I’m hoping the SOW will be signed first, before we start releasing any documentation.....

Thanks,

Mark

Hi Mark,

Thanks for dealing with my question about what happens to non-Counter transactions after TAs are accepted in
branch on the call yesterday. Just so that I am clear, are we saying that from this point non-Counter transactions are
dealt with in the same way as Counter transactions (save that non-Counter transactions don’t have JSNs)? Further,
am I right in thinking that Phase 2 will cover the controls and checks that apply when non-Counter transaction records
are pulled from the audit store? I know you mentioned that the headers and footers in the interface files are apparently
checked at that point.

Also, would you mind copying me in on any emails with Fujitsu, particularly the attendance note/action plan from
yesterday's call, so that I’m in the loop?
Thanks

Jonny
