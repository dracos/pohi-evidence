Official Sensitive and Subject to Legal Privilege: please do not forward outside the closed distribution list
Madhav,

Please find attached an update submission (with 5 annexes) on the Post Office Horizon litigation case. This is an info
sub to (i) bring Alex up to speed on the case; (ii) brief Alex on safeguards for handling POL’s legally privileged
information under the Disclosure Protocol and (iii) focus on plans for the oral briefing on 10 September by POL’s Legal
Counsel. Please note that POL have password-protected their background briefing (Annex 3) as an extra safeguard;
the password will follow by separate email.

For the benefit of copy addressees who saw this sub in draft a few weeks back, I should explain that the sub was put
on hold while we collected the required signatures for recipients on the closed distribution list. May I also take this
opportunity to remind you not to share this sub beyond the closed distribution list (latest list is on the final page of
Annex 2) — this is one of the safeguards to protect POL’s legally privileged info under the Disclosure Protocol.

Kind regards,
Stephen
