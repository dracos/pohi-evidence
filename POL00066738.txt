(TC: 00:01:22)
Peter Holmes: Yes.

(TC: 00:01:23)

Robert Daly: You have had comfort breaks. Right. Peter, just before we ended there, err, I was
asking you about, err, the branch trading statement for period two, which ended 28th of, err, May
2008. And we were talking about, err, previous to that, you said that six or nine months ago, you'd
got a loss of about £4,000 or £5,000. And every month, you seem to have losses, and you added it on,
until it's came to the £46,000. And on the May one, we have, or-, this figure's not great. It's either
1047. £147,79.78, possibly, or it's £124,779 and the 70 odd pence. But the cash declaration at 13:14,
err, is £85,458.24.

(TC: 00:02:34)
Peter Holmes: I can't explain that one, unless we found something in the safe after we'd done that, and
done a second declaration, but it’ s-, that, that hasn't been pinned to that, but I really don't know.

(TC: 00:02:45)
Robert Daly: By your own admissions, at this point, you were adding money onto your second cash
declaration.

(TC: 00:02:51)
Peter Holmes: Yes.

(TC: 00:02:53)
Robert Daly: So, it's possible that this is part of it.

(TC: 00:02:55)
Peter Holmes: It's possible.

(TC: 00:02:56)
Robert Daly: I mean, we can get the Horizon-, the Horizon data.

(TC: 00:03:01)
Peter Holmes: Mm-hmm.

(TC: 00:03:02)

(TC: 00:03:11)
Peter Holmes: Um, I honestly can't remember how long ago it was.

(TC: 00:03:18)
Robert Daly: But at, at this point, you started doing a second cash declaration.

(TC: 00:03:21)
Peter Holmes: It, it may have been that one. It may have been any of them, though.

(TC: 00:03:24)
Robert Daly: Right. Sorry. Just for the benefit of the tape, the chap in the door.

(TC: 00:03:27)
M: Would be (inaudible 03.28-03.55).

(TC: 00:03:55)

Robert Daly: Sorry about that. For the benefit of the tape, it's 15:10. Err, (inaudible 04.00) is
trying to get some information for me. Right, err, and this cash declaration was done by VMI, who
is Vicky Mitchell.

(TC: 00:04:09)
Peter Holmes: Vicky Mitchell’ s-,

(TC: 00:04:10)
Robert Daly: Now, and you say that you do the branch trading statement.

(TC: 00:04:13)
Peter Holmes: Yeah. Yeah.

(TC: 00:04:14)

Robert Daly: So, when Doreen went away at branch trading, was it then, did you increase the
amount of the cash, or did you just let it run, because you knew there was a second cash
declaration, with the money on it?

(TC: 00:04:32)
Peter Holmes: Just let it run

(TC: 00:04:33)
Robert Daly: Just let it run, because you'd already increased your second cash declaration.

(TC: 00:04:36)
Peter Holmes: Because I knew it was there.

(TC: 00:04:37)
Robert Daly: Yeah. What I was going to ask you was, on this declaration ID, 06, whose ID is that?

(TC: 00:04:55)
Peter Holmes: It's not a person's ID. It's just the ID of that particular declaration.

(TC: 00:04:59)
Robert Daly: Right, and-,

(TC: 00:05:00)
Peter Holmes: You're given a chance at giving it a number and we used to use 06 for them all.

(TC: 00:05:03)
Robert Daly: And what, what was the ID you gave the second cash declaration?

(TC: 00:05:05)
Peter Holmes: 09.

(TC: 00:05:06)
Robert Daly: And did anybody else know about this second cash declaration?

(TC: 00:05:10)
Peter Holmes: It's always on the screen, but nobody went into it.

(TC: 00:05:14)
Robert Daly: Nobody went into it.

Robert Daly: Now, the cash declaration for that day, it was done by Vicky Mitchell again at 17:48
on the 25th of the 6th. It was £41,091.40, and it's ID 06.

(TC: 00:06:11)
Peter Holmes: Yeah.

(TC: 00:06:14)
Robert Daly: Would you have increased the cash on your cash declaration 09? ID 09, to cover
that-, I mean, we're now at about £31,000, and that's in June this year.

(TC: 00:06:28)
Peter Holmes: Could have done.

(TC: 00:06:29)
Robert Daly: You could have done.

(TC: 00:06:30)
Peter Holmes: Mm-hmm.

(TC: 00:07:07)
Peter Holmes: No, because the one before had been up.

(TC: 00:07:10)
Robert Daly: Right.

(TC: 00:07:11)
Peter Holmes: It's, it's the misbalance between the two.

Robert Daly: So, I've got that one, and I've got the one previous to that that's probably kicked in,
as well. Well, it has kicked in.

(TC: 00:07:50)
Peter Holmes: Yeah.

(TC: 00:07:54)
Robert Daly: And the last trading period I've got just now is period five. 27th of the 8th 2008.
Sorry, it was from 30th of the 7th 2008 to 27th of the 8th 2008. Is that your signature?

(TC: 00:08:04)
Peter Holmes: It is, yeah.

(TC: 00:08:07)
Robert Daly: And the cash figure we have, you'll see here, is £91,839.11.

(TC: 00:08:13)
Peter Holmes: Yeah.

(TC: 00:08:14)
Robert Daly: Now, we've got an overreach of £1,189.99.

(TC: 00:08:18)
Peter Holmes: Yeah.

(TC: 00:08:21)
Robert Daly: Cash declaration done by Vicky Mitchell again. 06. £46,629.10. That's about £45,000,

(TC: 00:08:49)
Peter Holmes: It looks-, it looks like it, yeah.

(TC: 00:08:50)
Robert Daly: And, as I said, this Horizon data, we can details when your second declaration was
kicking in, because everything you do leaves a footprint on it.

(TC: 00:08:58)
Peter Holmes: Yeah, yeah.

(TC: 00:09:00)
Robert Daly: And that'll be followed up. So, by your own admissions, you've been producing false
accounts.

(TC: 00:09:10)
Peter Holmes: That was the second cash declaration, yeah

(TC: 00:09:13)
Robert Daly: Yeah. So, you're knowing, like, when you actually done these (mw 09.17) trading
statements-,

(TC: 00:09:17)
Peter Holmes: I did them.

(TC: 00:09:18)
Robert Daly: These were false accounts, on at least six to nine, or six occasions. More likely nine.

(TC: 00:09:27)
Peter Holmes: Yeah.

(TC: 00:09:27)
Robert Daly: Yeah. So, we've got this situation now, where it's-, we've got false accounting, and
you know it's a criminal offence to produce false accounts.

(TC: 00:09:40)
Robert Daly: But the money-, £46,000. You're experienced as a post master.

Peter Holmes: Yeah.

(TC: 00:09:50)
Robert Daly: You've been a policeman, previously.

(TC: 00:09:51)
Peter Holmes: Absolutely, and I wouldn't steal a penny.

(TC: 00:09:56)
Robert Daly: However, you've sat here and said (TC 00:10:00) that you've had, err, shortages
where you've put the money in.

(TC: 00:10:04)
Peter Holmes: Mm hmm.

(TC: 00:10:05)
Robert Daly: Couple of hundred pounds, at times. Why would you do if that if you're experienced,
sort of, post master? Why are you-,

(TC: 00:10:15)

Peter Holmes: I would have to tell the Cannons. You' ve seen what Anil is like. I, I just didn't want the
hassle. Anything for an easy life

(TC: 00:10:28)
Robert Daly: Yeah. So, how often did you actually put in a couple of hundred pounds?

(TC: 00:10:33)
Peter Holmes: When we were short.

(TC: 00:10:35)
Robert Daly: And how often was that, well, approximately? We need to be more specific here,
Peter.

(TC: 00:10:41)
Peter Holmes: You're going back a long time. You're going back past, past my memory, I' Il tell you. I
can hardly remember yesterday. Um, two or three times I suppose.

(TC: 00:10:50)
Robert Daly: So, possibly you put in £700, maybe £800-,

(TC: 00:10:53)
Peter Holmes: Yeah.

(TC: 00:10:54)
Robert Daly: Out your own pocket, just for an easy life. That’s a bit difficult to believe, Peter.

(TC: 00:11:11)
Peter Holmes: No. I don't take money out.

(TC: 00:11:13)
Chris Knight: So, you only put in £700, out of your own money?

(TC: 00:11:15)
Peter Holmes: Well, yeah. If, the following week, we'd had that money over.

(TC: 00:11:21)
Chris Knight: Mm hmm.

(TC: 00:11:22)
Peter Holmes: Then I would have taken it out to clear the books to balance.

(TC: 00:11:24)
Chris Knight: But do-, can you remember doing that?

(TC: 00:11:36)
Robert Daly: If most people put money in, they would take it out if they get opportunity, because
they're entitled to do so.

(TC: 00:11:40)
Peter Holmes: Well, yeah, but that opportunity hasn' t arisen.

(TC: 00:11:45)
Robert Daly: Right. Well, it has on a few occasions there. You've got ones where there's £1,000
over.

(TC: 00:11:50)
Peter Holmes: But those ones, I' ve left them. I haven't taken anything out. I' ve just let them balance
themselves out. Those figures are as they stand. I haven't taken any out.

(TC: 00:11:57)
Robert Daly: Can you explain to me why, up until August 07, you were, err, produce a (mw 12.05)
trading statement and give it to the Cannons, and let him see it, but since then-,

(TC: 00:12:10)
Peter Holmes: Basically, because he asked one for.

(TC: 00:12:12)
Robert Daly: Now, he says, no, you always gave them and, when he has asked for them, you've said
no, it's because the printer is too slow.

(TC: 00:12:19)
Peter Holmes: No. I've never had that conversation with him. I've always had a copy. The copies have
been in the back of the office, and if I get a copy, then there's a second copy printed, cos it prints two.

(TC: 00:12:34)
Peter Holmes: Mm hmm.

(TC: 00:12:35)
Robert Daly: All these £1,000 over, £100 short.

(TC: 00:12:38)
Peter Holmes: Mm hmm

(TC: 00:12:39)
Robert Daly: £1,000 short. So, would it be fair to say you haven't given them, because you haven't
want him to see the, the situation?

(TC: 00:12:46)
Peter Holmes: It's possible, yes.

(TC: 00:12:47)
Robert Daly: Well, it's not possible. It either is or it isn't, Peter.

(TC: 00:12:52)
Peter Holmes: No comment.

(TC: 00:12:54)

Robert Daly: Because if you were to actually-, say, for instance, take one of these. Have a look. This
one. £8,653.75 over. If you showed him that, he's gonna question you about it, isn't he? So, is that
the reason why you haven't showed him these branch trading statements?

(TC: 00:13:17)
Peter Holmes: It's possible.

(TC: 00:13:18)

(TC: 00:13:33)
Peter Holmes: He would ask me each Wednesday when I came in whether it was a big balance the night
before, and what was the balance like?

(TC: 00:13:38)
Robert Daly: And what would you say?

(TC: 00:13:39)
Peter Holmes: And I would tell him it was this, that or the other. I would-, probably wouldn't tell him
about the £8,000 one.

(TC: 00:13:44)
Robert Daly: Well, you say this, that or the other but-,

(TC: 00:13:45)
Peter Holmes: Because then he would come into the office and take us all apart.

(TC: 00:13:48)
Robert Daly: And, when you say this, that and the other, what do you mean? Does that mean
you're telling him it's okay, or you're telling him it's maybe this out, or that out?

(TC: 00:13:56)
Peter Holmes: I would tell him it was this out, or that out, but I wouldn't tell him it was the £8,000.

(TC: 00:14:00)
Robert Daly: Right, and what was the-,

(TC: 00:14:01)

might have shown me where that £8,000 was, or wasn't.

like to keep a lot in that one. We keep it in the joint account, so we can both have a go at it. If she's got
any-, if she's getting short to, towards the limit of what she wants in that account, she'll pay money in

Peter Holmes: No. That was Thelma. That was me (inaudible 28.09-28.16). Um, there must have been a
query about something for £40 odd and I' ve pulled that out to see what it was, but I can't remember what
the £40 was we were looking for at that time.

(TC: 00:28:33)
Robert Daly: That was the next question. Why are they all about £40? Well, you've answered that
one.

(TC: 00:28:36)

Peter Holmes: Must have put into the transaction log. It asks you how much you wanna pay, how much
you wanna query, and I must have been querying something for £40. Maybe one of the customers had
queried something with us, but I dunno why it would be in my bin at home (silence 28.48-29.03).

(TC: 00:29:03)
Robert Daly: Right. So, just for a minute, just look at the event log here. Just start at the 27th
again, was it?

(TC: 00:29:14)
Chris Knight: Yeah, it's (inaudible 29.14). Goes on the time, as well.

(TC: 00:29:19)

Robert Daly: Yeah (inaudible 29.21). Yeah. So, what we've got here at-, on the 27th of the 8th. I'll
just dig out this again. This is the branch trading statement again for period five, ending the 27th of
the 8th, and you showed an overreach of £11,000. Err, one-, sorry, £1,189.99. And there's a
difference in the cash declaration (TC 00:30:00) and the cash of about £45,000. However, just find
it again. You did a various check at 18:20, and you did discrepancy of £708.08. You see there. 27th
and 28th. 18:20. Why did it go from £708.08 to £1,189 over?

(TC: 00:30:49)
Peter Holmes: I don't know.

(TC: 00:30:51)
Robert Daly: (Talking over each other 30.52) 18:51.

cash again, then you’ve done a various check on it, and it's £708 ish, over. What did you do when
you found that £708 over?

(TC: 00:31:50)
