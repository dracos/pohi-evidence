Debt Recovery Processes under Branch Trading I

With the introduction of Branch Trading the error notice is replaced by the Transaction

Correction (TO), which is sent to your Horizon system.

On receipt of a TC you will have 3 options:
@ Accept and make good — cash (or remove cash)
@ Accept and make good — cheque I
© Accept and Settle Centrally i

N.B. For some TCs you may have the option to seek more evidence
This leaflet explains more about the process.

Accept and make good (cash or cheque)

You accept the TC and choose to make good by either cash or cheque. Your cash or cheque
figure will automatically be adjusted. All amounts up to and including £150 must be dealt with
in this way,

Accept and Settle Centrally

Remember: This option will only be available for amounts over £150.

By choosing the option to Accept and Settle Centrally you are moving the shortage or surplus
toa central account held in your name.

You will then receive a request for payment from Product and Branch Accounting. The request
for payment will usually be issued on a monthly basis.

If you do not respond to this request within 10 days you will be either sent a reminder or will
receive a phone call requesting payment. If you still fail to respond or settle the account within
7Zdays, as a last resort, deductions will start from your remuneration,

What if I want to challenge a TC?

Prior to the issue of a TC you may receive a phone call from Product and Branch Accounting to
either clarify a transaction under investigation, or discuss what appears to be a discrepancy to
ensure that you understand the TC when it arrives.

This is aimed at preventing disputes.
However, if you do receive a TC which you do not understand or wish to challenge you should
do so immediately using the telephone number given on zhe TC.
If the issue can be resolved at the time then you will either:

Process the TC and follow the options available.

or
If you provide additional information, and Product and Branch Accounting agree, a
second TC will be issued to offset the original TC. Both TC’s must be processed to
ensure no effect on the branch accounts

or

You will be asked to Accept and Settle Centrally and you will be given a reference
number to acknowledge that further investigation is due. Product and Branch
Accounting will then hold the amount on your central account and will block
recovery of that amount until the investigation is complete. Once complete you
will be informed either that the TC has been cancelled and removed from your
central account of that the amount will be added to your next request for
payment for the outstanding amount. See Appendix A for an example of a
Request For Payment.

What are my options at the end of the Branch Trading Period if a discrepancy is
identified and committed to local suspense?

Branch Trading does not change the requirement to make good losses nor does it replace the
liability for losses policy agreed with the National Federation of Subpostmasters.

If you have a discrepancy for less than £150 you will always be required to make it good by
cash or cheque.

POL00085794

If you have a discrepancy for over £150 and you can provide evidence that you should receive @
TC for the error, you will need to contact the NBSC helpline, They will assess your request and
allocate a priority rating dependent upon when you are due to roll into the next Trading Period.
NBSC will then advise Product and Branch Accounting to contact you. If Product and Branch
Accounting agree you will be asked to Settle Centrally and be given a reference number. The
amount will then be held in your central account whilst the issue of the TC is pursued. If a TCis
issued you will be given only 1 option — to Accept and Settle Centrally. This option cancels the
value held on your central account.

If after investigation, Product and Branch Accounting find no discrepancy to compensate for
the amount held, you will be informed that the item will be unblocked from your central
account and recovery sought via your next request for payment. If you do not have evidence to
support your claim you will remain liable for the shortage.
