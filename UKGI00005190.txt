Laura
Thank you for this note, which BNR has seen. She is looking forward to the discussion at Tuesday’s meeting. To ensure
this meeting was as valuable as possible, she commented that:

a) It was very helpful that Nick King would be attending

b) A lawyer would need to be involved in the meeting

c) She was keen to have a list of the senior officials that would attend.
Grateful if you could advise on who should be invited from legal. On point (c) above, I understand that Richard Callard
and Anthony Odgers will attend. The Minister is still keen that a senior official outside of ShEx be involved given that
part of this discussion is a policy one that may go beyond BIS’s shareholder role. I would be grateful for your steer on
how we can address this. I would like to go back to the Minister on this point this afternoon if possible.

Many thanks
Harriet

Please see attached a short note to the Minister ahead of our meeting with her on Tuesday. The note is intended to
assure the Minister that we are working up options based on our meeting with her earlier in the week. It also looks
ahead to the potential BBC Panorama programme on 10 August.

Rob — could you also put this to Nick King, given that he is due to attend on Tuesday.

Do let me know if either the Minister or Nick King have any comments or require any additional information before
we meet on Tuesday.

Thanks
