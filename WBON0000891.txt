Have you had a chance to get clearance for BD to look at your report? It would be good to get this done asap (ie. this

week).

Kind regards

Mark,

As we have just discussed, I appreciate that the “Horizon: Desktop Review of Assurance Sources and Key Control
Features; Draft for discussion” report dated 23 May 2014 (the “Draft Report”) does not yet incorporate all of Post

WBD_000761.000002
WBONO0000891
WBON0000891

Office Limited’s comments. However, I am concerned that given our current workloads and resources, getting the
Draft Report to a “final Draft” stage may take some time. In order to progress matters (which I am anxious to do), I
would like to release the Draft Report to Bond Dickinson (Andy Parsons, cc’ed) in its current format, subject of
course to them providing to Deloitte a suitable “hold harmless” letter.

I have looked at the “hold harmless” letter which Linklaters provided on 30 April 2014 (copy attached), and wonder
whether if the Draft Report could be released to Bond Dickinson on similar terms, subject to the first paragraph
being amended as follows (1 would have provided you with a mark-up, but don’t have a Word version!):

“We have now had an opportunity to consider your request for access to our report “Horizon: Desktop Review of
Assurance Sources and Key Control Features; Draft for discussion” dated 23 May 2014, which was prepared for
Post Office Limited under the terms of our engagement letter dated 9 April 2014 and Change Order Number 01
dated 6 May 2014. Post Office Limited has instructed Bond Dickinson LLP as advisors and have asked that we allow
Bond Dickinson LLP access to the Draft (in its current draft form) to enable them to provide legal advice to Post
Office Limited, to prepare documents based on the Draft for internal Post Office Limited use, and to make
reference to the Draft in future communications with Post Office Limited as required (the “Purpose”).”

Please let me know if we can proceed on this or some other basis.

Kind regards, Rodric

Hi Rod — thanks for this. There is a light-weight process for your solicitors in this regard, which we will progress
whilst you're away.

I would however like to get the report into a final version (or at least an agreed “final draft”) before sharing
externally. Are you ok for us to receive and process such changes that you’re on with and then share the ‘final
draft’ version from that point?

All the best

Gareth
