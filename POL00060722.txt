We haven't had a call yet but feels as if we need a face to face session with the Second Sight team, eg
Angela, you , me Simon and Andy with Rod to make sure there isn't an issue here and enable us to defend

it

will do. Let's speak Monday Alwen.

I can do a note to explain.

In essence TC's are initiated where there is evidence (quite often directly from the branch itself eg. By
a call from them) whereby it is evident a transaction has not been recorded or has been misrecorded, by
human error in the branch.

Over recent years TC's have been generated by a mixture of manual intervention and some more automated
processes (eg. Based on Camelot data feeds).

situations can arise where there is error in a TC itself due to human error centrally. In such cases it
should be evident to the branch and be challenged by them. We would then issue a TC to cancel it and one
to drive the intended accounting.

We have control steps in issuing TC's.

Let's speak and determine a most pragmatic means to articulate this in more detail.

If you wish to visit, that would be fine too.

Again its an area where NFSP reps and Multiple Partners have met with my team on visits here to explore
types and reasons for TC's. Coincidentally we host Alan Brook and his McColl team on conformance and TC

type themes in a couple of weeks time as part of such joint working with partners.

Thanks Rod

Rod
I would like to understand how TCs are created.

So my question is

Is there any way that an error in TCs could generate a doubling up of a loss. So when the spm gets the TC
and corrects it has that been generated by a person a computer programme or any other way

This is just to get things straight in my mind. Do we have or could someone explain the process map. I am
happy to come to to chesterfield if its easier to show me there. But can you have a think

Prove it to me so that we are ready to prove it to others

—g in the JO Hamilton case could we have been sending the wrong TCs, I don't believe we were but it is a

part of the process we need to check

Thanks
