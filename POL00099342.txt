Paula yes the SS cost is still unresolved. I have told them we have no more money in the budget to which
they suggested that BIS might pay. I explained that our funding didn't work like that. So now we have
resolved their role going forward we now need to discuss costs with them again.

I will talk to Chris tomorrow.
