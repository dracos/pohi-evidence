Martin,

This case had a response from us on 14/4/2014 which was an entirely different document.

The current version refers to the officer's suspicions that the robbery was not genuine but this was
not part of the prosecution case nor was it aired with the defence at the time. I do not think that it
is safe to allow such conjecture in the Mediation Response and have edited accordingly

Otherwise there is no objection to the document from our point of view.

Harry
