2248433 I Dalmellington Outreach Service - horizon I transaction discrepancies # 1358666 - Hi Anne, I’m aware you are on
leave until Monday 26th October and I’m on leave on the Monday to Wednesday next week (W/C 26th). Please see the e-
Imail chain below. From Peak and the e-mail chain I can see you did much of the investigation on this incident and as you
can see in the following e-mail it was concluded that Post Master could be advised how to avoid this happening and what to
ido if they did get into a transaction discrepancy situation. Could you please produce a KEL covering this incident advising
lof the avoidance actions. Thank you Tony From: Wicks Tony Sent: 20 October 2015 15:25 To: Bothick Sandie >; POA

17991774 I 2248433 I Dalmellington Outreach Service - horizon I transaction discrepancies # 1358666 - Hi Sandie, Looking
lat Peak PC0246949 it appears to be derived from 17991774 and I found TfS incident A105041260. There is no Problem
[Record raised for this, however Peak PC0246997 was used by Development to investigate this. A code fix has been
developed, but requires official testing and releasing. I’ve made enquires and unfortunately LST are unable to take the fix
for testing in Release 12.88 without significantly impacting that release to live. As the condition can be avoided by Post
Masters, i.e., by making them aware of the condition and advising them not to press enter multiple times, I propose that this
lis KEL’ed and included in the counter Release 13.05. Regards Tony From: Bothick Sandie Sent: 20 October 2015 12:06

[Dalmellington Outreach Service - horizon I transaction discrepancies # 1358666 - Hi POA DM Have PEAK make you
laware of this issue? Do you have a PR open — please see below from Atos in RED. Below is what I sent to Atos earlier — Hii
IKatie Im coming in blind on this — Looking at the incident this is our update from PEAK TfS Connector 15/10/2015 15:57
(00:00:00 Provider Desk Resolution POA-Horizon Provider Ref: PC0246949 Resolution Details: Update by Anne
\Chambers:Category 70 -- Final -- Avoidance Action Supplied:We have found that if there is a logout before a user has fully
logged on, then subsequently a pouch is remmed in manually (most likely at an outreach branch), then after the rem in slip
lhas been printed, the same screen is redisplayed and the user is likely to press Enter again and duplicate the remittance,
possibly several times. A different screen should be displayed which would prevent this happening. A rem in slip is printed
leach time, showing the same details but different session numbers, and a transaction log search confirms the repeated rems.
[This is not an area that has changed for several years so it likely to have happened before but we have no record of it having
been reported to us. I can only check back two months; I've found 4 other instances (outreach branches 214869, 106444,
110444, 207828) and all but the last removed the discrepancy by completing a rem out for the excess, which corrected the
system cash holding. Branch 224843 may be able to do the same but NBSC should advise on this. We are continuing to
investigate the problem (PC0246997), but any fix will not retrospectively change the branch accounts. So we are aware of
ithe issue and are continuing to investigate but NBSC should be able to sort the discrepancy out in the meantime. By the
sounds of it NBSC are just saying it our issue — which we are investigating — BUT they are missing the fact that they can
sort the discrepancy out. Thanks Sandie From: Austin, Katie (ext) [mailto:katie.austin.externa! Sent: 20 October

Service - horizon I transaction discrepancies # 1358666 Hi Sandie, Am looking for your assistance please! See below
response from NBSC in regards to the issue at Dalmellington Outreach&. Can you please let me know: - Is this issue an
lopen problem (if so is there a PR reference?) - When was this issue first observed? - Do we have any indications as to the
potential root cause? - What is the current action plan and associated timescales for resolution? I’d be really grateful if you
could share all the detail we have at this stage in order that I can respond to Anne and set expectations. Thank you! Katie

Service - horizon I transaction discrepancies # 1358666 Thankyou Katie, If this incident is caused by the branch action it
Imay be right and proper for NBSC to offer the advice given below however I am concerned that there have been 4 incidents
identified by Fujitsu with no explanation sitting behind them. NBSC cannot check what the branch has done on their
[Horizon system and do not understand the impact to the Branch Account hence the request for support from our colleagues
lin Finance Service Centre. Where incidents like this occur I would expect an explanation of the root cause to be supplied by
[Fujitsu via Atos so that both our Finance Service Centre and NBSC colleagues can be assured that the right advice is given,
there is no impact to the branch account and a full audit trail is available. It does not feel right for Atos and Fujitsu to be
giving instruction to NBSC to speak to branches with advice with insufficient information. If this has happened in this case
lit would be useful to see that in this email trail. Thanks Anne From: Austin, Katie (ext)
