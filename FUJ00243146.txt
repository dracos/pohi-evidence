FUJITSU Document

FUJITSU RESTRICTED — (COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE)

1 Introduction

This document provides a summary of Reconciliation within the HNG-X solution.

This document also outlines the Reconciliation incident management procedures required to investigate,
report and resolve all reconciliation incidents which are identified via the DRS (Data Reconciliation
Service) reports and also incidents raised via MAC (Major Account Controllers).

1.1 What is Reconciliation?

End to end Reconciliation within HNG-X is the mechanism by which Post Office Ltd (POL) and Post
Office Account (POA) establish which transactions are complete and correct, and which are not. An
incomplete transaction is not necessarily a Reconciliation incident, but it might become one if it is not
completed in a timely manner. A reconciliation incident is raised where:

* a transaction is expected but does not arrive in the reconciliation system in a timely manner
e the same transaction delivered to the reconciliation system from two separate sources differ
e transactions performed at Branch are not successfully delivered to POL Clients

Each and every Reconciliation incident is the result of some system fault or discrepancy. That incident
might, for example, be:

a software fault (introduced through either design or coding)
a system crash

An internet or other communications failure

Delivery of invalid reference data.

Such incidents may affect transactions, thus it is the job of Reconciliation Service to detect when and how
any transaction is affected by any system incident.

A reported Reconciliation incident provides:

e A business impact in terms of an error report on a transaction, and
e Evidence of a system fault or discrepancy that may need some corrective action.

It is acknowledged that not all software faults will lead to corrective action as this is generally done on a
contractual and/or cost benefit basis.

1.2 What does Reconciliation look like?

Reconciliation is delivered as a set of printable electronic reports.. The content and layout of the reports
reflect the system architecture. This has been detailed in the SVM/SDM/SD/0020: End to End
Reconciliation Reporting document.

1.3 How is Reconciliation used?

Reconciliation is used by Post Office Ltd:

e To provide Financial and Business Reconciliation at transaction level, i.e. to prove that each
transaction is complete and correct and to report any transaction that is either not complete or
not correct. Whilst Zero value transactions might not affect settlement or accounts, excessive
numbers can represent lost business. In addition, some APS transactions are zero value, but
they must still be passed through to the end client, e.g. Some DVLA transactions.

e Toprove the accounts are correct and to enable individual transactions to be identified that are
causing discrepancies in or incompleteness of the accounts.

e For settlement with Clients either by providing information to contribute towards the invoice or
payment generation.

FUJITSU RESTRICTED — (COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE)

Reconciliation is used by Reconciliation Service:

e For system diagnostics (fault finding) and to prove system integrity. Normally, all transactions are
of interest including those with zero value. Zero value on-line transactions may indicate some
‘network’ issue that caused the transaction to time out at the Counter. While it may be acceptable
for there to be a background level of these, they must be monitored so that corrective action can
take place if the volumes become excessive.

e For explaining to Post Office Ltd why transactions are incomplete or incorrect and to provide
evidence to support statements made;

e To prove that corrective action is effective.

Typically, Reconciliation reports fulfil the purposes of both Post Office Ltd and Post Office Account
without the need for separate reporting for each organisation.

3 Banking and Related Services (Online Services)

The Banking and Related Services Reconciliation Report Set or the DRS Report set are used by Post
Office Ltd for Reconciliation and settlement with Clients and by Reconciliation Service as input to error
resolution and as evidence when advising Post Office Ltd of the true state of transactions. Reports are
produced for transactions categorised below for the different Clients:

Network Banking transactions for Clients:
« —Vocalink
e Electronic Top Ups transactions for Client EPAY
e Debit & Credit Card (D&CC) transactions for Client MA
e Debit & Credit Card (D&CC) transactions for Amex.

3.1 DRS Reports

The DRS is the Data Reconciliation Service for NBS, DCS and ETS. It is an implementation of a state
table based on input flows, [C12], [C4], and [D].

[C12] flow comes direct from the Branch Database at the End of Day,
e [C4] flow reflects the bank view of the transaction,
and

e — [D] flow represents an error form of the [C4] flow when it can be determined that a transaction is
inconsistent from the bank point of view.

DRS reports are defined in SVM/SDM/SD/0020 (End to End Reconciliation Reporting).

3.2 Report Distribution

Reconciliation reports will be delivered to Post Office Ltd via the PODG delivery service. Files will be
presented to PODG in accordance with the Service Level Targets as stipulated in the Data Centre
Operations Service — Service Description document SVM/SDM/SD/0003.

3.2.1. Contingency in the Event on Non delivery of reports to Post
Office Ltd

If Fujitsu Services is unable to deliver any or all reports to the Post Office Ltd. gateway by 08.00hrs the
day following the run date of the report, Fujitsu Reconciliation Service will liaise with POL Finance to
discuss appropriate means of information transfer. Fujitsu Reconciliation Service will operate this
contingency under ‘reasonable endeavours’ and will aim to have the reports with POL Finance by
09.00hrs in contingency. However, this timescale may not be achievable if there are additional
processing problems via PODG and FUDG.

Any distribution list for these reports is considered by both Fujitsu and Post Office Ltd to be of a dynamic
nature and therefore specific addressees are not covered within this document

3.3. Reconciliation & Incident Handling

Reconciliation Service shall study and monitor the DRS reports and report on any Banking and Related
Services transaction states which are:

e intrinsically anomalous, in that their occurrence implies malfunction in End to End On Line
Services; or

* anomalous in that an expected state has persisted for an unexpected duration (e.g. where
C12 Confirmations are received from the BRDB but the C4 messages have not been received
via the EMIS file, for further details on processing of this particular state see 3.3.1.4, below)

Exceptions reported within the DRS Report Set will be applicable to:
« Communication difficulties between the Post Office branch and the BRDB, Worldline etc
«Errors within the DRS.
* Corruptions within the DRS.

3.3.1 Generation of Business Incidents

Business Incidents will only be generated by the following groups within Fujitsu and Post Office Ltd.

« Fujitsu Reconciliation Service for all exceptions reported via the DRS report set.

e POL Finance for any ‘Enquiry Based Banking Transactions’ (EBBT) or ‘Disputed Transaction
Notice’ (DBTN) discovered by Post Office Ltd. that has not been reported by Fujitsu
Reconciliation Service via the DRS report set

e Fujitsu Third Line Support (SSC) for any system fault or database adjustment which is
considered by Fujitsu to have a reconciliation or settlement implication within Post Office Ltd.
in respect of banking and related transactions.

3.3.1.1. Business Incident raised by Reconciliation Service

Reconciliation Service will raise an appropriate Business Incident when needed via the BIM database for
all exceptions that require reconciliation reported on the NB102 Section 2 and 5 of the DRS report set.

3.3.1.2 EBBT incidents raised by POL Finance via MAC

It is important that POL Finance supply sufficient information to the MAC when generating a Business
Incident in respect of an EBBT to ensure the timescales for the resolution of Business Incidents referred to
in section 3.4.2 can be achieved. Achievement of such timescales is dependent upon the following
information being provided by POL Finance when generating a Business Incident via the MAC:

1. ATS incident is to be raised.
2. Incident must contain the following transaction detail:
« Branch code
« HNG-X Transaction ID number
«Value of transaction
e Date of transaction.

NB: Where POL Finance raise a business incident for an EBBT Business which may require a large
amount of supporting information, summary detail only may be given to the MAC and the additional
information may be sent via e-mai itsu Reconciliation Service at

PostOfficeAccount.reconciliation, GRO. }

3.3.1.3 DBTN incidents raised by POL Finance via MAC

This facility is to support requirements in respect of Disputed Banking Transaction Notice (DBTN) where
Post Office Ltd. has received notification via either the Post Office branch or the Branch Support Centre
(BSC). POL Finance will contact Reconciliation Service directly by telephone, or email, requesting urgent
investigation within the timescales quoted in section 3.4.2. Followed by a TfS bonded incident raised by
POL.

Achievement of such timescales is dependent upon the following information being provided by POL
Finance when generating a DBTN enquiry via the Enquiry Service:

« Branch code

NB: If incorrect or insufficient information is provided by POL Finance to allow resolution of the DBTN
enquiry, no further action will take place until the requisite information is supplied and the enquiry will not
be monitored in accordance with the timescales referred to in section 3.4.2.

3.3.1.4 The Worldline “Reinjection” Process and Business Incidents

Whenever “State 1” anomalies, where C12 Confirmations are received from the BRDB but the C4
messages have not been received via the EMIS file, have been identified in reconciliation reports for
more than 1 day, Reconciliation Service will raise an Incident with Worldline asking whether the
transaction appears in their “ERROR_File” of transactions. If the transaction does appear in the

“ERROR _File” then Reconciliation Service will request the “reinjection” of that transaction and no BIM will
be raised. When Worldline process the “ERROR_File” the transaction will be completed and the C4
returned. If Worldline identify that the transaction does not appear in the “Error_File” then a BIM will be
raised.

3.4 Business Incident Reporting

3.4.1 BIM Reports

e The Business Incident Management system (BIM) has been designed to report the progress to
resolution of a Business Incident to allow Post Office Ltd. to complete an accurate reconciliation
or settlement with their clients. For ease of identification and association, BIM report references
will take the Fujitsu internal Incident and Problem Management System (PEAK) reference
number. In all cases each BIM report will have a unique identifier.

e ABIM report will be issued for each Business Incident generated. BIM reports are designed to
notify POL Finance of the detail required to assist in the reconciliation or settlement process
within Post Office Ltd. domain. BIM reports communicate information concerning the resolution of
the symptom of an underlying cause, not the cause itself; this information would be supplied via
the Problem Management route, if escalated to this level.

e Where a System Incident is generated to eradicate the cause of a particular problem and there is
‘one or more associated Business and Related Services Business Incidents, cross-references will
be supplied on the Business and Related Services Business Incident BIM report and via the
Problem Management process to allow tracking of the System Incident.

3.4.1.1. BIM Report Distribution

e The Reconciliation Service will distribute BIM reports to POL Finance, using the Fujitsu corporate
e-mail network. In the event that the Fujitsu or Post Office Ltd corporate email systems are
unavailable, Fujitsu will discuss with POL Finance appropriate means of information transfer.

« BlM reports distributed in accordance with this section will be deemed to have been issued to
POL Finance at the time of transmission by email.

e Anexample of a BIM report is shown at Section 6.

3.4.1.2 Clearance Criteria

e Reconciliation Service provides information concerning On Line Services Business Incidents to
POL Finance on a ‘drip feed’ basis, by issuing updated versions of the initial BIM report.

3.4.2

BIM for Banking and Related Services - SLT conditions

Reconciliation Service will raise an initial BIM report relating to a new Business Incident on the same

working day
the morning

as the Business Incident is generated via the MAC or the Enquiry Service, or in any event on
of the next working day. This will be made available in accordance with Section 3.4.1.1 to

POL Finance. This initial, incomplete, BIM report will serve to notify POL Finance that a Business Incident
has occurred and that the completed BIM report will be provided to POL Finance within the agreed
timescales below.

In the event

of the DRS Report Set not being available to Fujitsu Reconciliation Service in time to enable

any exceptions to be notified within this timescale, Fujitsu Reconciliation Service will contact POL
Finance to agree a temporary extension to the timescale.

All enquiries

and transaction searches within 90 days of the original transaction date will be carried out by

the Reconciliation Service via the DRS/Worldline ePortal. Enquiries and transaction searches where the
original transaction date is in excess of 90 days will be carried out by the Reconciliation Service using the
POA Audit Archive.

The Reconci
timescales:-

1.

iliation Service will ensure the final cleared BIM report in accordance with the following

For DBTN enquiries where the transaction date is within 90 days of the date the
transaction is disputed by the end customer and raised by POL via the MAC in
accordance with Section 3.3.1.3 :

95% must be resolved within <= 8 hours of notification based upon all DBTN enquiries
(Customer Critical Exceptions) received within the quarterly reporting period

The following conditions apply to DBTN enquiries:

The calculation of the time to resolution within the above SLT will only commence from either
the receipt of the C4 or D transaction component within the DRS, or the reporting of a Priority

3.4.2.1. SLT Exclusion / Suspension Criteria

e Where an exception has been generated due to factors outside of Fujitsu control, e.g. where
a Post Office branch has failed to communicate due to fire, flooding or other agreed
‘Enforced Closure’ conditions, the exception will be removed from the BIM SLT calculation in
agreement with Post Office Ltd and resolved using ‘Reasonable Endeavours’.

« Where an exception necessitates the retrieval of information from, or access to, a Post Office
branch to enable successful resolution and this is not available, the period whilst Fujitsu
waits, having requested information or access to be provided, shall not count towards the
time for resolution of that exception.

e Post Office Ltd. will be informed via the BIM report relating to the exception under
investigation that SLT suspension is being invoked.

3.5.2 Incomplete States

Incomplete states are reported on NB102 reports as defined in SVM/SDM/SD/0020 (End to End
Reconciliation Reporting).

3.5.3 Exception States

Exception states are reported on NB102 reports as defined in SVM/SDM/SD/0020 (End to End
Reconciliation Reporting).

4 Automated Payment Service (APS)

The APS Report Set produced by Fujitsu central systems and the End-to-End APS reconciliation have
been designed to enable APS transactions completed in Post Office branches to be reconciled to the
transaction stream received by Post Office Ltd, via Post Office Ltd Core Finance System (CFS) to enable
settlement to be made with Post Office Clients. This also applies to transactions of zero value; while these
transactions do not affect financial reconciliation they will be reported in cases where they were not properly
transferred to the Automated Payment (AP) Clients or CFS.

For the avoidance of doubt, there is no automated reconciliation between APS and CFS. Any
reconciliation is manual and based on the comparison of the Client Transmission Summary with the CFS
Vendor Accounts.

4.1 APS Reports

The following reports are sent daily to POL Finance:

* —aps_reconciliationyyyymmdd.txt
*® aps_exceptionsyyyymmdd.txt

These are further explained below but a full definition can be found in SVM/SDM/SD/0020.

4.1.1. Report Distribution

As governed by email availability, the Reconciliation Service will ensure all reports are made available to
POL Finance by 09.00hrs daily, Monday to Friday basis only. For example, on a Monday or the day after
a bank holiday, reports will be delivered for all days having occurred since the delivery of the last set of
reports.

Reports are initially sent to POL Finance using the Fujitsu corporate email account. If the Fujitsu or POL
email accounts are not available, Fujitsu will discuss with POL Finance appropriate means of information
transfer.

The distribution list is considered by both Fujitsu and Post Office Ltd to be of a dynamic nature and therefore
specific addressees are not covered within this document.

4.2 APS Reconciliation & Incident Handling
4.2.1 APS Business Incidents

4.2.1.1. Reconciliation Errors within APs reports

Reconciliation errors within the APS Daily Account Balancing Report should be minimal and, if they do
occur, will be applicable to:

¢ — Software errors
e Unidentified differences classed as ‘Reconciliation Errors’
e Delayed Transactions.

There are two reports that deal with these errors:
aps_reconciliationyyyymmdd.txt

This reports the overall health of the delivery system by ensuring that all APS transactions are
either delivered to AP Clients or by ensuring that any Delayed Transactions are dealt with
appropriately. Any reconciliation imbalance in this report is due to Software errors or Unidentified
‘Reconciliation Errors'

aps_exceptionsyyyymmadd.txt

This reports any outstanding Delayed Transactions.

4.2.1.2 Delayed Transactions on aps_exceptionsyyyymdd Report

Where transactions have failed to be delivered to Post Office Clients, they are referred to as Delayed
Transactions.

In normal circumstances, these transactions will be input by Fujitsu SSC into the APS data file via the APS
Exception Processor Application and will be received by Post Office Client 24 hours later, subject to the
client's delivery agreement. There may be occasions when transactions cannot be sent via the data file
process and have to be delivered to ‘Manual’. In such cases full details of the transaction are supplied via
the BIM report route; these incidents are NOT chargeable.

There are 4 reasons why transactions will be quarantined/delayed and reported on the
aps_exceptionsYYYYMMDD report, these are as follows:

A duplicate transaction has been identified

An unmatched reversal has been found

A negative amount has been received where not expected
The Client Account number is not valid

PONS

Duplicate Transaction
These do not occur in practice.

Unmatched Reversal
Can occur in rare instances involving the counter recovery procedure.

Invalid Negative Value
Can occur if the Client Delivery Agreement or APADC reference data has been set-up incorrectly.

Invalid Client Account

Can occur if the Client Delivery Agreement or associated reference data has not been created
correctly.

4.2.2. APS Business Incident Originators

It is envisaged that APS Business Incidents will only be generated by the following groups within Fujitsu
and Post Office Ltd:

e Fujitsu for errors reported via the APS report set and End-to-End APS reconciliation

e POL Finance or POL RDT for any other reconciliation or settlement error discovered by POL
Finance that has not been reported by Fujitsu Services

« Fujitsu SSC for any system fault or data update which is considered by Fujitsu to have a
reconciliation or settlement implication within Post Office Ltd.

Subject to agreement by the parties to the contrary, Post Office branch raised Incidents into the MAC team
will not generate APS Business Incidents. However, Incidents from Post Office branches will be monitored
and if it is considered necessary by Fujitsu incidents reported to Fujitsu will be elevated to APS Business
Incident status.

4.2.3. Generation of Business Incidents

APS Business Incidents will only be recognised as such if generated by Fujitsu or Post Office Ltd via the
MAC. This ensures that the APS Business Incident is properly logged, enabling Fujitsu to ensure that
corrective information can be supplied and any underlying system fault can be rectified.

It is important that POL Finance supply sufficient information to the MAC when generating an APS.
Business Incident to ensure the timescales for the resolution of APS Business Incidents referred to in
section 5.4 can be achieved. Achievement of such timescales is dependent upon the following
information being provided by POL Finance when generating an APS Business Incident via the MAC:

« ATS Incident is to be raised.
e Relevant details including the Branch code, date of the transaction, value of transaction, HNG-X
Transaction ID should be supplied.

NB: Where POL Finance raises an APS Business Incident which may require a large amount of supporting
information, summary detail only may be given to the MAC and the additional information sent via e-mail
to Fujitsu Reconciliation Service, at PostOfficeAccount. reconciliation!”

4.3 Business Incident Reporting
4.3.1. BIM Reports

e The Business Incident Management system (BIM) has been designed to report the progress to
resolution of a Business Incident to allow Post Office Ltd. to complete an accurate reconciliation or
settlement with their clients. For ease of identification and association, BIM report references will
take the Fujitsu internal Incident and Problem Management System (PEAK) reference number. In
all cases each BIM report will have a unique identifier.

e ABIM report will be issued for each Business Incident generated. BIM reports are designed to
notify POL Finance of the detail required to assist in the reconciliation or settlement process
within Post Office Ltd. domain. BIM reports communicate information concerning the resolution of
the symptom of an underlying cause, not the cause itself; this information would be supplied via
the Problem Management route, if escalated to this level.

e Where a System Incident is generated to eradicate the cause of a particular problem and there is
one or more associated Business and Related Services Business Incidents, cross-references will
be supplied on the Business and Related Services Business Incident BIM report and via the
Problem Management process to allow tracking of the System Incident.

4.3.1.1. BIM Report Distribution

e The Reconciliation Service will distribute APS BIM reports to POL Finance, using the Fujitsu
corporate e-mail network. In the event that the Fujitsu or Post Office Ltd corporate email systems
are unavailable, Fujitsu will discuss with POL Finance appropriate means of information transfer.

e BIM reports distributed in accordance with this section will be deemed to have been issued to
POL Finance at the time of transmission by email.

e An example of a BIM report is shown at Section 6.

4.3.1.2 Clearance Criteria

e The Reconciliation Service provides information concerning APS Business Incidents to POL
Finance on a ‘drip feed’ basis, by issuing updated versions of the initial BIM report.

e ABIM report is ‘Cleared’ when the Reconciliation Service has provided the requisite
reconciliation / settlement information.

« MER charges are detailed in the Reconciliation Service: Service Description document reference
SVM/SDM/SD/0015.

4.3.2 Reporting Timescales

The Reconciliation Service will use reasonable endeavours to raise an initial BIM report relating to a new
APS Business Incident within 24 hours of the notification of the incident. This will be made available to
POL Finance, on the same working day as the APS Business Incident is generated via the MAC, or in
any event on the morning of the next working day.

In the event of the APS report set not being available to Fujitsu in time to enable any errors to be notified
within this timescale, Fujitsu will contact POL Finance by telephone or email to agree a temporary
extension to the timescale. The Reconciliation Service will use reasonable endeavours to ensure the final
completed BIM report is made available in accordance with section 5.1, and is cleared within five working
days of the date the APS Business Incident was generated via the MAC.

Where there is a need to correct APS Data Errors Fujitsu will use reasonable endeavours to deliver the
corrected data file to the AP Client(s) within five working days from the date the APS Business Incident
was generated via the MAC. This may however, not always be practical due to the technicalities of
creating a corrected data file if there is a high volume of data.

There is no agreed timescale for the resolution of a System Incident. Fujitsu will give every System
Incident the priority it deserves (including the Problem Management escalation process) taking into
account Post Office Ltd's requirement and will aim to deliver an initial analysis of the root cause within 5
working days and a final analysis and evidence of remedial action, within 10 working days.

If the Problem Management route is taken the issue will be closed by mutual agreement.

4.4 Client File Delivery

4.4.1 Variable File Transfer

Post Office Clients take transaction delivery from Fujitsu in accordance with their own processing
requirements. NB: Specific Client requirements are described elsewhere; this document is not intended to
describe this detail.

FUJITSU RESTRICTED — (COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE)

APS transactions from Post Office Ltd branches are available for onward transmission each day to Post
Office Clients should they require it. However, some Post Office Clients only require transactions to be
delivered on a five day, or one day per week basis. This has no impact upon the reconciliation between
the actual Post Office Client transmission and the Client Transaction Summaries (CTS).

The CTS accurately identifies the volume and value of the ‘normal’ transactions (not reversed / reversing
transactions) that have been delivered to the Post Office Clients on a particular day, in accordance with
their specific requirements.

4.4.2 Reconciliation in the event of non-delivery of the CTS to Post
Office Ltd

POL Finance will use the CTS as the basis for settlement with Post Office Clients. In the unlikely event
that Fujitsu fails to deliver the CTS file to POL or POL reject the file, it is also possible to send the CTS
file to POL via email if the normal means of delivery is not available.

Settlement is time critical and Fujitsu will ensure all the relevant system derived APS reconciliation
reports are delivered on time to ensure that settlement can be made between Post Office Ltd and its
Clients. In order to satisfy this requirement, Fujitsu has elected to make all reconciliation reports available
by 09.00hrs as stated in section 4.1.1, Monday to Friday, excluding bank holidays.

5 TPS Reconciliation

5.1 TPS Report Set

At Release 20.35 all remaining TPS functionality was subsumed into the Branch Database. At Release
20.55, the TPS system was decommissioned. There are no remaining TPS Reports and no possible
TPS reconciliation errors as a result.
