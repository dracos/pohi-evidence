MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

Summary

MOT proved most of the test phase objectives (see section 2.2). The
test phase built on the achievements of previous rehearsal cycles,
proving;

¢ Pathway’s target solution. With the inclusion of additional security
measures across all domains, MOT simulated the most live-like R2
environment to date.

¢ the Data Centre migration process. MOT was the fourth successful
attempt at this scenario

¢ live support processes are progressing and gaining a good
understanding of R2 operations.

One objective was not fully achieved, that of proving the final draft of
the operating procedures. The final version of the counter User Guide
was not available. An earlier draft version was used as an interim
solution.

The MOT Release Notice detailed system limitations by referral to the
KPR. An exhaustive cross-reference of MOT functionality against the
KPR has not yet been undertaken, however one is planned to occur
from 22/03/99. Results of this activity will be published separately.

Of the 3 specific limitations identified in the MOT Release Notice;

* One was not encountered throughout the test cycle - (mixture of
MiECCO and MiMan migration)

¢ The remaining two were encountered and handled using the
solutions described - (MiECCO products not migrated and CAP
rollover without a Cash Account printed.)

The MOT Release Notice identified 202 incidents from previous test
cycles that had been resolved for the MOT baseline. A large majority
of these incidents were witnessed as cleared in MOT (a similar result
was obtained during E2E Final). Full details of the MOT results are
available under the Retest heading of section 6.

A number of issues raised during MOT are still outstanding. These
incidents will either;

¢ be assessed by Product Assurance and Pathway for inclusion on
the KPR, or

« have the resolution of the incident proved in a cycle of targeted
testing prior to the commencement of Live Trial

Conclusion

A decision as to whether the solution is fit for live implementation is
the responsibility of the Release Authorisation Board (RAB).
Therefore this document will comment only on the achievements
made, and the issues identified during MOT.

Achievements

The following have been successfully demonstrated:

¢ Bootle R2 data centre build

* networking and communications

¢ data centre security

* installation of outlet equipment

* auto-configuration of R2 counters

¢ migration of outlets from Release 1c to R2

¢ use of MiMan migration tool and draft HFSO procedures
¢ use of MiECCO migration tool

¢ data centre migration from Release 1c to R2

¢ links to ESNS (OBCS), Farnborough (HAPS) and Huthwaite (TIP)
¢ link to De La Rue

« PAS/CMS Help Desk operation

¢ Horizon Help Desk operation

¢ Pathway support procedures

* operation of the four main application areas

* operation of the Data Warehouse

* application of planned changes to Reference Data

* availability of local reference data items

¢ benefit encashment at Rel 1c, Rel 2.0 and via PCHL

¢ BES activity (and OBCS restrictions) at a Northern Ireland Outlet
¢ increased levels of security

© operation of ‘Training’ mode

© user training

Issues

The following issues were identified:

Version 1.0 Page 6 Date 01/04/99
Model Office Testing Evaluation Report for Nile Release 2.0

« The OBCS service was affected by an operational problem at all
outlets on most days. A solution has been identified, and is due to
be applied to the software build for Live Trial. The OBCS service
was successfully maintained during the E2E cycle, although this
may not fully reflect the live solution.

¢ The counter migration tools proved stable when handling core
(nation-wide) products. However, some difficulties were
experienced with the handling of non-core (local) products. Due to
the diversity of local product to Outlet mappings, and the fact that
MOT used derived reference data, assurance of this area should be
focused elsewhere (i.e. the Live Reference Data Proving Exercise).

¢ The migration of the Release 1c Data Centre to R2 had an adverse
effect on some elements of the solution. Most notably;

¢ BES - Foreign encashments, Casual Agent encashments, and
Restricted PO indicators can be affected if 1c generated
payments are encashed at a R2 outlet. The impact of these
scenarios on the live audience should be limited, therefore the
above issues have been captured on the KPR rather than fixed
for Live Trial
« EPOSS - The system continues to report on pre-migration
transactions. A solution has been identified that will resolve
this issue, which should be applied prior to Live Trial
¢ The final draft of the counter procedures were not available.
Subsequent procedural testing suffered as a result.

« Although no fault in system functionality, certain areas of the
solution (e.g. Shared Stock Unit operation) proved difficult for live
users to comprehend. Bearing in mind the above statement
regarding the quality of procedures during MOT, this area may
need to be monitored during Live Trail. Any shortfall in operating
instructions detailing these new and often complex areas, should
be remedied before implementation to a wide audience.

INTRODUCTION

This is a summary report addressed to Horizon management to
comment on the conduct of the Model Office Test phase of Pathway’s
Release 2 testing. It focuses on the testing environment, the testing
activities performed, the results of these, and the conclusions drawn.

Background

Pathway Release 1b and 1c successfully completed an integrated
Model Office.

To continue this trend, the Model Office Test schedule for Release 2

was formulated over a period of months between November 1997 and

July 1998. This preparation activity included;

* a series of Workshops, where representatives from all groups
identified their requirement for testing

* the publication of a matrix of these identified tests

¢ additional preparation activity culminating in the issue of a High
Level Test Plan

¢ adrop down of the HLTP into a test plan and test scripts

These tests scripts were then executed over the various Model Office
cycles. Amendments and revisions were made as required

Purpose

MOT completes and ratifies the objectives identified during the three

planned Model Office Rehearsals. To reiterate, it’s major objectives

are to prove:

¢ the final draft of the operating processes and procedures across all
domains

e Pathway’s target solution for architecture, network and
connectivity

« Pathway’s supporting infrastructure

* assurance of the migration process from Release 1c to R2

¢ that supporting and reporting processes and routes are in place

MOT is seen as the final audit pass of the Model Office testing phase
of Release 2. Following the successful completion of three rehearsal
passes and a number of preproving runs, it is not expected to
encounter any major functionality issues.

Version 1.0 Page 8 Date 01/04/99

FUJ00058445
FUJ00058445
Model Office Testing Evaluation Report for Nile Release 2.0

2.3

The format of the testing was identical to that used all three rehearsal
cycles.

The MOT cycle continued to use the Model Office site based in
Borough High Street and was supported by Pathway operations at
the R2 target live operational environment in the Bootle data centre.

Scope

Model Office Testing, in parallel with End to End testing, will be the
first instance where all live systems and interfaces will become linked.
Although focusing on each of the systems procedures, there will be an
opportunity to ensure that the transactions passed through the
Horizon counters, are correctly reflected within the ‘back-end’
accounting and reconciliation process.

A more detailed description of the purpose and scope of Model Office
is available in the End to End Interface and Model Office Testing Approach
[3].

An overview of the system components included (and excluded) from
MOT can be found in section 3.4 Summary of system functionality

« DeLaRue
« DSS
« Customer Accounting and Payments System (CAPS)
« Feeder Benefit Systems (Child Benefit)
« Payment Accounting Group (PACS)
¢ Order Book Control System (OBCS)
¢ POCL
« Reference Data Project (RDP)
¢ Transaction Information Project (TIP)
« Host Automated Payments System (HAPS)
e Horizon Test Team (HTT)

Environment

The test environment within the Pathway domain comprised two
data centres, one at release 1c and the other the target R2 go live
solution, with links to all external systems.

Gateway PC’s, for the transmission of data to remote sites, were
located at Farnborough, Huthwaite and De La Rue, Tewkesbury.

The test environment within the Horizon domain comprised seven
Post Offices; three of these offices were migrated from release 1c to
R2; four new offices were introduced into the R2 system, two from
ECCO and two that were previously operated manually.

During the four test cycles, Pentium II 400mhz processors and
flatscreen displays were introduced to the hardware platform.

For this pass of Model Office, an increased level of security across all
domains.

TEST CONDUCT
Timescales

Release 2 Model Office Testing consisted of a 22 physical day test
schedule, spreaad over a five week period (allowing for setup time
and contingency). This schedule was ultimately executed three times
as a ‘rehearsal’ and then 1 final audit pass. Originally, only 2
rehearsals were planned, with the MOT pass completing by the end of
1998. An additional rehearsal cycle was inserted after MOR1 to prove
late-breaking code enhancements. A period of time was utilised
between MOR3 and MOT to allow time to identify and implement
solutions to the many issues raised during the previous rehearsal
phases. During this gap, a period of pre-proving activity was
undertaken. The purpose of this pre-proving activity was to witness
resolution to a number of outstanding issues. It was also used to gain
confidence in the financial integrity of the system and some of its
supporting interfaces.

Planned Schedule

The testing was performed by Horizon test staff and Post Office
counter staff over the period 17th February to 10th March inclusive,
the stages being:

e 17h - 19th February, phase 1 of migration, moving three outlets
from release 1c to R2, with the data centre at release 1c.
¢ 20th - 21st February, data centre migration to R2.

¢ 22nd February - 10‘ March, full R2 operation and the introduction
of new R2 outlets.

Actual Schedule
MOT completed to planned timescales.

Counter activity was completed on the 10/03/99. Interface activity
continued for a number of days after this.

OBSERVATIONS

Throughout the course of the four Model Office test cycles,
approximately 30 front-end users have been exposed to the Horizon
system for the first time. Their views and opinions on various aspects
of usability are documented in the following section.

Environment

A number of comments were raised on the behaviour of the system
interface. It is recognised that changes may be difficult to implement
prior to Live Trial, however they are documented here for
consideration in the light of wider user experience.

Keyboard

The keyboard was intended to be an improvement on both the
Standard ‘QWERTY’ keyboard and the ECCO+ keyboard. Model
Office ‘live’ users suggested the following improvements;

« Increase the size of the QWERTY keyboard keys to be the same as
the numeric keypad.

« Move the ‘Home’ and ‘PLU’ keys away from the numeric keypad.
Accidental use of these keys can have adverse effects during
Cash/Stock declaration and Serve Customer transactions

« Place the numeric keypad at the bottom right of the keyboard.
« Colour code the keys to map on to specific navigation functions
¢ Dedicated function keys for access to frequently used transactions

Touchscreen/Monitor

The flatscreen monitor was acknowledged as a major improvement
over the normal monitor, increasing icon clarity and size.

A majority of users stated that the on-screen alphanumeric keypad
would be more useable if ordered ina QWERTY fashion.

Printers

When used as installed, the back-office inkjet printer was found to be
slow, taking around 30 minutes to produce a Cash Account report.
After manual intervention (setting the printer properties from
‘Colour’ to ‘Highspeed’) this was be improved to around 6 minutes.

Model Office Testing Evaluation Report for Nile Release 2.0

5.2

5.3

A degree of operator intervention was required to print Girobank
forms or BES encashment receipts satisfactorily.

Human Computer Interface (HCI)

The test operators identified a number of future improvement
considerations regarding the layout and content of the various
interfaces between the user and the system. Examples of some of
these are listed below;

¢ It would be useful to have a ‘Other Postage’ icon available on the
‘Postal Order’ sub-menu, as many postal orders are sold with
stamps attached

« When entering the volume and value of an OBCS encashment, it
should be possible to limit the request for volumes of milk tokens
to only applicable benefits (by use of the CPP number)

« When entering the volume of an OBCS encashment, you should
not have to first delete the default value

« When performing a Girobank transcash transaction, it would be
useful to have the current fee as a default value.

¢ When applying additional services to scales transactions, the list of
services should be sorted in order of popularity

« There is no need to have a ‘Postmasters Examination’ section on
the SU balance snapshot

¢ The order of the items on the Stock / Stamps and Cash declaration
screens should be logical (i.e. by denomination) and should be
reflected on the SU Balance and Office Balance reports

¢ The ‘Gas Transcash’ icon should be renamed to ‘Utilities Transcash’
to encompass the many Electricity bills handled for Girobank

¢ The ‘Other Stationery’ icon is currently a postage stamp. A letter or
other stationery item would be more appropriate

¢ The icon for Second class Stamp Books should be blue rather than
orange

In addition to these suggestions, a number of incidents that were
closed as ‘No Fault’ or ‘Requires CP to change’ have been passed to
POCL Business Assurance for assessment. Again, full details of these
possible enhancements are available on request.

Training

Four training events held were in preparation for MOT, and a number
of concerns were noted;

Version 1.0 Page 14 Date 01/04/99

FUJ00058445
FUJ00058445
Model Office Testing Evaluation Report for Nile Release 2.0

¢ The duration of the training event, (a day and a half) may not be
long enough to cover the full scope of the Horizon system, for all
staff. It should be noted that follow-up training and guidance were
not included in preparation for Model Office.

¢ Greater attention should be given to the BES area, in particular,
multi-benefit payments (although I understand that additional
training will be provided when the functionality becomes
available), carded casual agents and alternative payees.

¢ The provision of gateway Back-office printers would be helpful to
show examples of office weekly reports and cash accounts in
production.

¢ Due to the differences between ECCO+ operation and current
system functionality, it would be beneficial to be able to perform
scales transactions with the aid of scales, instead of just the manual
method.

¢ Training could be improved in the following areas;
¢ The transfer of a session from one counter to another

¢ dealing with discrepancies, error notices and the suspense
account.

* performing transfers in. This would be beneficial as it differs
from the ECCO method.

« APS fallback procedures (i.e. the recovery of AP transactions
following system failure)

¢ The only BES summary produced was BES card impound. The BES
daily encashment report would be a better example especially as
BES payments were made during the training.

Some positive points worthy of note;
« How to amend errors and/or make alterations ( E.G. back space
key, undo , previous icons) was addressed early on in the course.

« The various role play exercises during the course, especially the
assessment at the end, were well received.

« The following sections were especially considered to be fully
covered;

¢ logging in and out

¢ identifying hardware

¢ bill payments

* settlement

¢ OBCS

* standard BES encashments,

Observations

The reference data used to support Automated Payments in MOT was
derived from Live Reference Data in June 1998. Therefore testing of
reference data held attributes (such as minimum, maximum and
multiple amounts) may not have been as comprehensive or aligned
to current reference data. Confidence in this area could be gained
from the Live Reference Data Proving Exercise underway at OSG,
Farnborough.

All areas of current AP functionality were covered within the MOT
schedule. Some observations noted at the counter;

« There is no report available to summarise Smart transactions
(which are entered on Horizon for accounting purposes only at this
release) - It is understood that these transactions may be included
in the AP transaction summary at a later date.

« After completing each AP transaction, the user is prompted to
select a Method of Payment, as some AP clients accept only Cash as
a form of payment. Regardless of the MOP selected, the user is
allowed to settle the customer session with any form of payment.
Some validation of the AP MOP would be beneficial.

¢ Restrictions on AP reversals were successfully applied (i.e. attempt
reversal on the following day, in the next CAP, e.t.c.)

6.1.3.5

Observations

The scope of BES testing within Model Office was restricted to a
single benefit, ie. Child Benefit. This constraint meant that certain
areas of BES functionality were omitted from MOT (see section 3.4.2,
‘Areas not covered within Model Office’ for details). This factor must
be borne in mind when reviewing the overall status of the product.

The cards and PUN’s delivered for MOT were not to live standard
(ie. Blank cards / PUN’s produced on a separate environment at
DeLaRue). Liveried cards were not produced because the customer
details used to create the BES cases for MOT were sourced from the
live customer database, creating possible security implications.
However pseudo-live PUN’s were provided.

Problems were encountered with DeLaRues Card/PUN delivery
timescales, often resulting in tests being performed via manual details
rather than Card or PUN. This delay has been attributed to test
environments constraints, and should not apply to live production
timescales.

The overall performance of the BES application was good, however
an issue was identified with the hybrid period between migration of
the Ric and R2 Data-Centres. This generated a number of issues (and
subsequent incidents). Some examples of these issues are;

¢ Erratic results when attempting Carded Casual Agent encashments

¢ Inability to perform foreign encashments during the hybrid period
between counter and data centre migration

¢ Inconsistent results when applying Geographical Restrictions (i.e.
encashing a GB -only payment at a Northern Ireland outlet)

¢ The incorrect application of a 30 minute lock-out when attempting
nominated office encashment

The above issues seem to be because we are attempting to encash
payments generated on a Release 1c data centre at a Release 2 outlet.
This has been identified as a known problem, and has been captured
in various guises on the KPR.

Observations

All areas of EPOSS showed signs of improvement over the course of

the four cycles of Model Office. For example, reports that were
unavailable in MOR1, became available in MOR (albeit with incorrect

Version 1.0

Page 30 Date 01/04/99

FUJ00058445
FUJ00058445
Model Office Testing Evaluation Report for Nile Release 2.0

outputs). In MOR3, the report output was improved, and by MOT the
report was almost correct, with only minor content or formatting
problems outstanding. Due to the increased quality of the system
produced outputs, concentration could be focused on the integrity of
each transaction performed, across all levels of reporting.

The main difficulties experienced with EPOSS were in areas that
strayed from current automated processes, such as;

¢ Shared Stock Unit balancing. i.e;
¢ Differences from ‘MUTE’ operation (A facility on ECCO+
where every user is attached to every stock unit). To
implement MUTE methodology on Horizon would be time
consuming exercise (i.e. detaching and reattaching from Stock
Units)
¢ The declaration of Stock, Stamps or Cash requires entry of up
to 100 items. These values are not stored by the system, so if
errors are made during the declaration process (or the system
applies a temporary lock), the user is required to re-enter the
declaration from scratch. This will happen frequently in the
live environment, and will impact the overall balancing
timescales. Preference would be to retain the shared Stock
Unit, but have each user’s declarations available for
modification at any time prior to balancing.
¢ Clearing Losses and Gains

¢ The posting of losses/gains to the suspense A/C , (and the
subsequent redemption of these transactions) is a time-
consuming process that was completed automatically on
previous automated platforms.

6.1.6.4

Observations

All Offices except Watford experienced long delays in the auto-
configuration stage, between installation and migration. This was due
to difficulties experienced with the application of Work Packages to
bring the counter hardware up to the current MOT baseline.

The following table gives an approximate time of migration for each
Office configuration;

FUJ00058445
FUJ00058445

Office Migration type No. of SU’s_ I Set-up time Actual migration time
Portsmouth I MiMan 5 4 Hours 21/2 Hours
Cardiff MiMan 1 4 Hours 1 Hours
Arsenal MiMan 6 3 Hours 21/2 Hours
Omagh MiMan 3 3 Hours 2 Hours
Wolves MiECCO 7 6 Hours 11/2 Hours
Celtic MiMan 3 3 Hours 11/2 Hours
Watford MiECCO 17 1 Hour 21/2 Hours
The actual migration time includes time taken to produce SU
snapshots for comparison with pre-migration balance reports and
subsequent checking of Office Balance reports.
The MiMan process was mainly a success, with test operators
completing the majority of the migration process. As in previous test
cycles, there were products without the appropriate mapping on
Horizon. This is attributed to the minimal local product sets which
have remained the same throughout Model Office Testing. The only
real fault was the omission of the suspense account at Omagh (which
was only discovered when the 1st Cash Account was produced).
The MiECCO application suffered from similar problems as in
previous rehearsals, i.e.;
* Some stock items that didn’t map across to Horizon were adjusted
to cash, others were adjusted to an open product line.
« Some transactional values (receipts/payments) were missing after
migration which in turn created a misbalance of the Cash Account.
This problem should be resolved for Live Trial by the addition of
new procedures to transfer missing data to the Suspense Account
(This should be incorporated into the HSFO guide ).

Observations

Setup and file transfer activity was commenced two days prior to test
execution, this included;

¢ Defining Outlet Specific Reference data.

¢ Associating a list of Local Products for each Outlet.

A further 3 reference data drops were applied during the cycle, which
included the following changes ;

« Up-rating of non-core product.

¢ Introducing non-core product ( Fixed value ).

« Adding a new core product ( Open value ).

« Accounting change - C/A line change for Moneygram send
transactions.

¢ Re-valuation of postal Orders.

« Amendment of Girobank (Short Name only) to Alliance & Leicester
Giro.

¢ Deletion of a core product.

The system automatically printed warning messages of forth coming,
ref’ drops when applicable .

Initial problems were encountered with the application of local
products at Wolves, Celtic and Watford, however all became
available in the 2nd week.

Overall the implementation of the Reference data change drops was
satisfactory, with the following exceptions;

« The Moneygram C/A line change failed. Value and Volume of any
transactions performed were missing completely from the C/A
after the reference drop had been implemented.

¢ Deletion of core product failed, the ability to cease products willnot
be available until Release 2+.

automatically initialised each day. This was due to the Tivoli
scheduler (which starts this application each day) being interrupted to
allow the backup of the MOT environment. As a result, the first
attempted OBCS activity each day was unsuccessful, reporting
‘Unable to contact HQ’. The application could be manually started,
and then OBCS performed as expected. Changes have since been
made to Tivoli to ensure that this problem does not occur in live.

OBCS was not available at the Omagh test configuration, confirming
that the Service could be restricted from Northern Ireland outlets.
However, the application of this restriction could have been handled
better. For example, all OBCS icons are available at Omagh, but do
not function when selected. Preference would be to either remove the
OBCS icons, or bar access to them (indicated by ‘no entry’ symbols).

Observations

The original timescales for delivery of procedures (in the form of User
Guides) was to take delivery of a draft version for the rehearsal
cycles. This was to be corrected and improved upon during each
rehearsal cycle, culminating in a live-like version, contextually
correct, and produced by Head Office Publications, available for
MOT.

Unfortunately, this target was not achieved in time for the
commencement of MOT. The procedures were made available during
the cycle, but still in draft form (i.e. loose leaf photocopies). The test
operators made the best use of these procedures as possible, but
inevitably, difficulties were encountered that may not have been
evident if a complete issue had been available. This is perhaps
reflected in the large number of procedural issue identified during the
final cycle.

I understand that most of the 50 or so procedural incidents raised
have already been rectified, or are in the process of being resolved.
However, the testing view of the procedures (detailed below), reflects
that these remedies have not been witnessed by Model Office users
during the final pass, or in any subsequent testing activity.

A draft version of the set of Quick Reference Guides was made
available for use and review. The content and quality of these guides
was impressive, instantly being adopted by the test operators. The
consensus of opinion is that, should the quality of the User Guides not
improve, there is a danger that they would be consigned to the shelf
while the Quick References become a valuable source of information.

6.1.10.4 Observations

Tested for the first time during MOT, the stability of Training Mode,
and the quality of corresponding Workbooks impressed members of
the Test Team. However, a small number of discrepancies were noted,
and (if functional in nature) were raised as incidents.

Of the issues raised, accessibility to Training Mode is the giving the
most concern. Almost half of the counters available during Model
Office failed to initialise into Training Mode. No resolution or
explanation was given for to account for this.
