Dear Sir

R v Seema Misra Guilford Crown Court case reference number 120090070

Post Office Ltd was successful in prosecuting Misra last month. She is due for sentencing
on the 11° November 2010. I write to enquire whether the Court would be prepared to
authorise the release of the tapes of the hearing to us, for us to arrange for them to be
transcribed?

We need the transcript to us in other cases where Fujitsu and the Horizon system are
challenged on similar facts. If the Judge is prepared to release the tapes to us or the
transcribers for this purpose I would also want them to include details of the sentencing
hearing.

Lastly I should also be obliged if you could recommend the names of any firms of
transcribers which have been successfully used by the Court in the past.
