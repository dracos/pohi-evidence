1. Introduction

The purpose of this note is to describe the issues found at Warwick (FAD 506246)
when attempting to roll over the Branch on 27/01/10 and the analysis that has been
carried out as to their root cause.

2. The Problem

The problem was that when balancing the last Stock Unit, the User was not prompted
to clear their Local Suspense. This subsequently meant that attempting to rollover the
Branch failed due to Local Suspense not being clear.

Subsequent attempts to create further Stock Units to clear local suspense appeared to
fail.

3. The Cause

The root cause of the problem is a Stock Unit Z which was deleted during the Trading
Period. In particular, this Stock Unit had at some stage included a Bureau Product
5131(Australian Dollars). Due to the differences between how Opening Figures are
generated on Horizon and HNG-X, this Stock Unit included an Opening Figure for 0
Australian Dollars. HNG-X’s test for the last Stock Unit to roll, erroneously
considered this Stock Unit to still be active and so didn’t consider the last real Stock
Unit to roll over as being the last Stock Unit and hence didn’t prompt for Local
Suspense to be cleared.

The attempts to create further Stock Units and manually clear Local Suspense were
not successful. However it is believed that this mechanism can be used to clear the
Local Suspense.

It is recommended that Fujitsu talk the Branch through the process to confirm that this
resolves the issue.

4. Future actions

Since the scope of this issue is very specific, namely:

1) A Branch has a Stock Unit which at some point has held Foreign Currency on
Horizon

2) That Branch Migrates to HNG-X

3) That Stock Unit is Deleted before attempting to first balance the SU or Branch
on HNG-X

Also the fact that there is believed to be an avoidance action — namely manually
clearing Local Suspense, then it is recommended that a KEL is raised associated with
the issue and no attempt is made to change the related code.
