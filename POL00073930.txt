Hi Joanne

I terminated the Contract for Services of Mrs Susan McKnight as she resigned to avoid termination following her
suspension.

Having lost all my files from my laptop when it died so don’t have much on this. My recollection is a loss of approx £55k
but Mrs McKnight tried to blame a member of staff, Horizon and lack of training.

Steve do you have any info from this case as I recall the daughter and son ran the place as Mrs McKnight suffered with
MS

Regards
Paul
