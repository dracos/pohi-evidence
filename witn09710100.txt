                      POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY




          FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF PETER JAMES SEWELL




I, MR PETER JAMES SEWELL, will say as follows:


INTRODUCTION

  1.    I am a former employee of Fujitsu Services Limited ("Fujitsu"), having left

        the company in November 2009.


  2.    This witness statement is made to assist the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry

        (the "Inquiry") with the matters put to me in a Rule 9 Request dated 26 July

        2023 (the "Request"), to the extent I have or had direct knowledge of such

        matters.


  3.    The topics covered by the Request concern events that occurred over 13

        years ago and relate to audit data from the Horizon IT system ("Horizon")

        and audit queries (also known as audit retrieval queries or "ARQs"). I have

        tried to remember these matters to assist the Inquiry as much as possible,

        however, due to the time that has passed, my recollection is limited. For this

        reason, the content of my witness statement focuses largely on the

                                                                                   WITNO9710100




      documents that the Inquiry has referred me to in the Request, which I have

      referenced below using the Inquiry's Unique Reference Numbers.


 4.   I was assisted in preparing this statement by Morrison Foerster, the

      recognised legal representatives for Fujitsu in the Inquiry.


PROFESSIONAL BACKGROUND

 5.   1 joined ICL in 1990. In late 1997, 1 first joined ICL's Post Office Account team

      ("POA") as a Project Manager working on various tasks. These included

      managing a development team who wrote the code for auto configuration

      whereby a counter PC was switched on and introduced to the estate,

      managing a third-party supplier who developed the roll out program, and

      managing a development team to provide a training facility on the counter. I

      would also interview staff applying for jobs on the Horizon project. My

      manager at the time was Dick Long.


 6.   In 2002, I joined the POA security team in a similar capacity as a Project

      Manager. My work in this role included writing an anti-virus implementation

      procedure via a change proposal to make it ready to introduce to the live

      estate. I was also responsible for sample testing the pin pads prior to release

      to the outlets and maintaining a record of units tested and the test results. I

      provided support to the security manager, Bill Mitchell, who was later

      replaced by Brian Pinder.


 7.   During 2007, the security team was split into policy and operations teams,

      both reporting to a new security manager, Howard Pritchard. At this point I

      had the role of Operations Team Manager. My responsibilities were

         managerial in nature, namely business as usual tasks and supporting Mr

         Pritchard.

BACKGROUND

 9.      The Inquiry has asked me to set out the role I had in relation to each of the

         following matters in connection with Horizon, both in its first iteration (known

         as "Legacy Horizon") and the second iteration (known as "HNGx"):


          a. Post Office Limited ("POL") disciplinary matters;


          b. matters relating to those accused of criminal offences;


          c. matters relating to criminal or civil proceedings;


          d. witness evidence in any proceedings; or


          e. the extraction of audit data.


 10.     In responding to this question and setting out my role, the Inquiry has

         referred me to the following documents, which I have reviewed:


                                     Page 3 of 18
                                                                                      WITNO9710100
                                                                                    WITNO9710100




      FUJ00122130,          FUJO0122131,          FUJ00122134,         FUJ00122151,

      FUJO0122152,          FUJO0122153,          FUJ00122154,         FUJ00122189,

      FUJ00122190,          FUJ00122197,          FUJ00122198,         FUJO0122203,

      FUJ00122204, FUJO0122217 and FUJ00122218.


11.   I did not have a role in relation to the matters listed in subparagraphs 9(a)â€”

      (d) above. In relation to subparagraph 9(e), in 2007, I became the Operations

      Team Manager within the security team (as noted above), overseeing

      Penelope (Penny) Thomas, Andy Dunks and Neneh Lowther. My

      responsibilities were managerial only. Ms Thomas was a specialist in ARQs

      and reported to me, which included providing weekly updates regarding

      outstanding ARQs and court dates. However, I did not have a personal role

      in relation to the extraction of audit data (i.e., I did not perform ARQs myself).


12.   The Inquiry has also asked me to set out the nature of my working

      relationship with Gareth Jenkins, Penny Thomas and Anne Chambers and

      to detail what I understood to be their roles in respect of matters relating to

      the provision of evidence in court proceedings. I have set this out below.


      a. Gareth Jenkins was an "Applications TDA (Technical Design Authority)";

          he provided the security team (mainly Ms Thomas) with technical advice

          and guidance and provided evidence in court.


      b. Penny Thomas was in litigation support, providing POL with ARQ data.

          Ms Thomas was an ARQ specialist and a member of the security team.


      c. Anne Chambers was a technical designer who worked in the Software

          Support Centre ("SSC"). Mrs Chambers provided the security team

                                                                                 WITNO9710100




            (mainly Ms Thomas) with technical support advice and guidance and

            provided evidence in court.


RELATIONSHIP WITH POL

  13.   The Inquiry has asked me to describe any circumstances in which I would

        have contact with POL in relation to issues concerning Horizon, including the

        relevant contacts and the nature of my relationship.


  14.   I had contact with Sue Lowther, the POL Security Manager. I had detailed

        knowledge of the Horizon project, including the relevant people, their roles,

        and where to find information, and so would attend security meetings

        between managers, Bill Mitchell (later, Brian Pinder) in the POA security

        team and the POL security team on a monthly basis to provide support.


  15.   I liaised with Alan Simpson at POL to review incident management, mainly

        of counter down time. I worked directly with the POA customer service team

        and so could provide Mr Simpson with information on the counters.


  16.   I was also in contact with Graham Ward at POL, and his manager Dave

        Posnett. Mr Ward was the Casework Manager who requested ARQs and Mr

        Posnett was the Fraud and Risk Manager. Mr Ward liaised directly with Ms

        Thomas on ARQ matters, and he regularly visited ICL's Feltham and then

        Bracknell offices to meet with Ms Thomas. When I became the Operations

        Team Manager in the security team, I wanted to meet the POL team and I

        believe Ms Thomas and I had at least two meetings with Mr Ward and Mr

        Posnett. I do not recall discussing the specifics of ARQ data with Mr Ward or

        Mr Posnett; while I was Operations Team Manager, Mr Ward continued to

        liaise with Ms Thomas in relation to this.

                                                                                   WITNO9710100




ARQ DATA FROM HORIZON AND THE PROSECUTION SUPPORT SERVICE

 17.   The Inquiry has asked me to set out my recollection as to the process for

       providing audit data to POL and explain the structure and function of Fujitsu's

       Prosecution Support Service and my role in relation to the service. The

       Inquiry has also referred me to FUJ00155212, FUJO0155214 and

       FUJ00155413, which I have reviewed.


 18.   I recall that Fujitsu had contractual requirements with respect to the provision

       of audit data, which included:


       a. the retrieval and analysis of archived Riposte message store data,

          including event logs, and calls to the Horizon Helpdesk;


       b. responding to ARQ requests from POL for Horizon branch transaction

          data and the retrieval of event logs and Horizon Helpdesk calls; and


       c. providing witness statements and attending court when requested to

          support the ARQ data supplied.


 19.   I did not have a direct role in relation to the provision of ARQ data to POL,

       however, as noted above at paragraph 11, I was Ms Thomas' line manager

       in 2007. Ms Thomas was the security team member primarily responsible for

       the provision of ARQ data to POL.


 20.   I do not know if the processes described above varied in relation to Legacy

       Horizon and HNGx.


 21.   In relation to the structure and function of the Prosecution Support Service,

       there was one security team member who primarily provided this service with




                                   Page 6 of 18
                                                                                     WITNO9710100
                                                                                   WITNO9710100




        another team member to provide back-up support when needed. These two

        security team members would respond to ARQ requests from the POL

        Casework Manager and carry out data extractions from audit files. This data

        was then sent securely to POL via a CD-ROM.


  22.   The technical support for this role was primarily Gareth Jenkins, with the help

        of various technical support staff within the Horizon technical teams,

        including the SSC.


ARQ PROCESS ISSUES

The incident at Craigpark and the "ARQ Service Issue"

  23.   The Inquiry has asked me for a detailed account of (i) an incident that

        occurred at the Craigpark Post Office branch (FAD code 141832)

        ("Craigpark") and how it related to the ARQ process and the reliability of

        data, (ii) the approach to witness evidence that followed the issue at

        Craigpark, and (iii) a certain issue or issues regarding ARQ data variously

        referred to as an "ARQ Service Problem", "ARQ Service Issue", "Prosecution

        Support Urgent Issue" and a "Security Incident" in the 2008/early 2009 period

        ("ARQ Service Issue"). In responding to these questions, I have reviewed

        the following documents as referenced in the Request: FUJ00154823,

        FUJ00154824,         FUJ00154841,         FUJ00154842,         FUJ00155455,

        FUJO0155448,         FUJO0155474,         FUJ00155476,         FUJ00155478,

        FUJO0155492,         FUJO0155498,         FUJ00155456,         FUJ00155231,

        FUJO0155232,         FUJO0155263,         FUJ00155271,         FUJ00155272,

        FUJO0155274,         FUJ00155276,         FUJ00154828,         FUJ00155278,

        FUJO0155397,         FUJO0155367,         FUJ00155402,         FUJ00155371,

        FUJO0155373,         FUJO0155257,         FUJ00155265,         FUJ00155268,

                                                                               WITNO9710100




      FUJ00155270,        FUJ00155409,          FUJ00155412,       FUJ00155421,

      FUJ00155422,        FUJ00154833,          FUJ00154835,       FUJ00155241,

      FUJ00155242,        FUJ00155371,          FUJ00155378,       FUJ00155385,

      FUJ00155386,        FUJ00155387,          FUJ00155388,       FUJ00155389,

      FUJ00155391,        FUJ00155392,          FUJ00155390,       FUJ00155394,

      FUJ00155399, FUJ00155400 and FUJ00122604.


24.   The ARQ Service Issue was related to the incident at Craigpark. The incident

      at Craigpark concerned an event log issue that highlighted errors with the

      End of Day ("EOD") process which caused some transactions to freeze and

      create an event error. The issue identified at Craigpark raised questions

      regarding the integrity of data supplied to POL as part of the ARQ service.


25.   Having reviewed contemporaneous records regarding the incident at

      Craigpark (for example, FUJ00155397), I recall that the issue was identified

      following a detailed technical investigation by Fujitsu technical staff, who

      found out that transactions running during the EOD process had caused a

      lock in processing and a Riposte error event was written to the event log. It

      was identified that this problem had been caused by a previous bug fix, which

      was introduced into Legacy Horizon's live estate in May 2007. Whilst this

      investigation was running, a manual exercise was carried out to examine the

      event log data from ARQ data associated within the dates of May 2007 and

      November 2008.


26.   I became aware of the issue when error events were discovered whilst

      examining event data during an ARQ extraction for Craigpark. There were

      several meetings and discussions between Mr Jenkins, Mrs Chambers and



                                 Page 8 of 18
                                                                                  WITNO9710100
                                                                                WITNO9710100




      Ms Thomas, and other managers and support staff. I was usually invited to

      these meetings; however, my input was very limited as I did not always

      understand the technical details in relation to the ARQ extraction. As

      manager, my objective was to find out what went wrong and identify the

      appropriate individuals to resolve the issue. The task of resolving any issues

      were left to the technical staff, including those I have named above. There

      were many meetings that took place to find a resolution to the problem; these

      were mainly between the technical staff. I cannot recall who attended these

      meetings, but I believe some of the meetings were documented.


27.   When the error was identified, it raised questions regarding the integrity of

      ARQ data previously supplied to POL. Previous ARQ data was analysed and

      events stripped out to check other event errors. A change proposal was then

      raised by Alan Holmes to incorporate this manual process of performing

      additional counter event checks into the ARQ service to enable analysis of

      counter event messages (as shown in FUJ00155272) and check for any

      other event errors. As the change proposal concerned the security team's

      function, it required a sponsor/owner from the security team, and I was made

      sponsor for this particular change proposal. As sponsor of the change

      proposal, I was invited to meetings to discuss the wording of the change

      proposal, but again my input was very limited as I lacked the technical

      knowledge. The meetings were run by Mr Holmes, and individuals like Ms

      Thomas and possibly Mr Jenkins would have been present. The change

      proposal was enhanced to incorporate the manual process into the ARQ

      application and remove manual intervention in the ARQ process for the

      HNGx solution. Once the analysis of the problem was completed, Fujitsu's


                                 Page 9 of 18
                                                                                  WITNO9710100
                                                                                WITNO9710100




      senior manager of the POA customer service team, Steve Denham, was

      given a presentation of the change proposal and why it was being raised.

      Once the change proposal was approved, the work on implementing the

      changes could begin and changes to the HNGx ARQ application could be

      introduced. I do not recall any discussions regarding POL's likely reaction to

      the proposed changes.


28.   Following the discovery of the additional event error (noted above at

      paragraph 25), there was discussion over amending the wording of the

      witness statements provided by Fujitsu to POL to include the additional

      checks. There were several meetings (some of which I was present at), and

      emails exchanged on how to make these changes. From reviewing the

      documents provided to me by the Inquiry, it looks like no substantial changes

      were made to the witness statement to reflect the changes to the ARQ

      service. There may have been smaller revisions made to the witness

      statement, but I do not have any recollection of this.


29.   I believe POL were informed of the ARQ Service Issue and the change

      proposal once the full impact of the potential problem was established. In

      relation to POL's involvement in investigations relating to the issue, there

      were emails exchanged between Fujitsu and POL discussing the problem.

      The problem was recognised as sensitive as the event errors raised

      questions regarding the integrity of ARQs. I believe the POL legal team were

      also consulted and they reviewed the situation with the POL management

      team to provide their input. There was a change in the approach taken to

      reviewing event errors related to cases being pursued by POL when this

                                                                                     WITNO9710100




      issue arose, and the manual process was introduced and continued to be

      run to check event logs for potential problems. POL requested that Fujitsu

      process the outstanding cases and complete the event analysis as soon as

      possible. Both POL and Fujitsu staff worked together to agree on a workable

      solution due to the sensitive nature of the problem.


30.   Senior management from Fujitsu and POL were involved and kept up to date

      with progress. Fujitsu senior management communicated with POL senior

      management on the matter, and both were constructive to agree a solution.

      I believe Fujitsu and POL senior management were concerned with ensuring

      that the necessary checks were carried out on the ARQ data retrospectively

      once the issue had been identified. In turn, they were concerned with getting

      the change proposal approved so that the new changes could be

      incorporated into HNGx code.


31.   In relation to the resolution of the issue, the fix for the software issue relating

      to the EOD process was delivered to the live estate in October 2008. The

      issue of manually analysing event logs was replaced by introducing this

      automatically into the application for the HNGx solution once the change

      proposal was approved and the additional filtering was introduced in the

      retrieval application. The tactical solution would have to continue during the

      lifetime of the Legacy Horizon audit system. As can be seen from

      FUJ00155476, the change proposal was finalised and approved on 31

      March 2009.

My handover

  32.     The Inquiry has asked me to set out any handover or discussions of ongoing

          work I recall having with Andy Dunks or others following my move to another

          role. In doing so, I have reviewed FUJO0155498 and FUJO0155507 as

          referenced in the Request. I recall speaking with Mr Dunks about him

          continuing the meetings with Mr Simpson regarding incident management.

          These meeting were mainly based on reviewing lost time on the counters.

          There were no other handovers made and I retired after this in November

          2009.


GENERAL

  33.     There are no other matters that I would like to draw to the attention of the

          Chair of the Inquiry.


Statement of Truth

I believe the content of this statement to be true.
