a I July 2012

Thank you for your letter of 12 July raising concerns about the Post Office's
Horizon system and the planned independent review on behalf of y

Post Office Ltd (POL) remains fully confident about the robustness and
integrity of its Horizon system and related accounting processes. Over the past
ten years, many millions of branch reconciliations have been carried out with
transactions and balances accurately recorded on Horizon by more than
25,000 different subpostmasters in total.

Nevertheless, in the light of discussions with James Arbuthnot MP and a
number of other MPs with ex-subpostmaster constituents who had raised
concerns about Horizon, POL has agreed to an external review of these few
individual cases that had been raised with them by several MPs.

The external review of specific individual cases will be undertaken by a firm of
forensic accountants and the timescale and precise processes for identifying
the cases for the review are in the process of being finalised. James
Arbuthnot will arrange for the details to be circulated to interested MPs in due
course and I will arrange for you to be included in this.

NORMAN LAMB MP
