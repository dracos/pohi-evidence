3. The incident

At approximately 5.25pm on Thursday 2"4 May Mr Martin
Griffiths (Subpostmaster) and his clerk Julie Griffiths
(no relation to subpostmaster) were on duty and were
putting all the cash and stock away. Both safes were
open.

Mr Griffiths was stood at the secure door which also
housed the Parcel Hatch. The Postman had arrived to
collect the mail, Mr Griffiths had put around 2 mail bags
outside of the secure door and the postman had taken
these out of the office to his van.

As the Post Man re entered the branch 2 masked men
wearing dark clothing, one with a balaclava and one with
a stocking of his head burst in and pushed the Post man
aside. Mr Griffiths stated that he was stood at the
secure door with the door open so he could hand the daily
work and giro pouch to the Post Man and get him to sign
for the paperwork and went over to the secure door.

One man tried to pull the door open while the other man
attacked the screen with a sledge hammer.

Mr Griffiths attempted to get the door shut at which
point he believes he was hit on the left hand with some
sort of metal bar (possibly a crow bar). At this point Mr
Griffiths stopped fighting and allowed the 2 men into the
secure area. At this point the assistant Julie Griffiths
had crouched down and hid behind the coin safe.

One assailant stayed at the door while the other emptied
both safes and took the cash tray and stamp portfolio off
the top of the counters and put them into the black
holdall that they were carrying.

The 2 men fled in what was believed to be a Red Honda
Civic car (another male was waiting in this).

Martin pressed the alarm and the police arrived shortly
afterwards. The police called the ambulance to look over
Martins hand. It was badly bruised but nothing serious
and did not go to hospital.

was cash.

¢ Nocustomers were present in the Post Office at the Time of
the attack

e The SPMR Mr Martin Griffiths sustained bruising to his left
hand due to being hit by a metal bar — An ambulance

It should be noted that when the Trauma Support Manager visited
the branch on Tuesday 7" April 2013 the version of events given
by the assistant Julie Griffiths was different to what Mr Martin
Griffiths had stated.

Below is an extract from the Trauma Support Managers
report (Lee Heil).

Her account states that Martin was actually sat down at
the counter position next to the secure door when the 2
males entered and she had to tell Martin what was
happening as he wasn’t aware. She informs me that the
parcel hatch was open and that he went to the secure door
when they started smashing the screen which is where I

believe Martin sustained the injury to his hand whilst
trying to shut the parcel hatch. She said they emptied
one safe and shouted ‘Where’s the rest of the money’ at
which point Martin took them over to the time locked safe
that was already open
