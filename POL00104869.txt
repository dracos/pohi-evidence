Interpreters at Suspect Interviews

1.
1.1

General

If it is known in advance that an interpreter might be needed,
arrangements should be made for them to be present from the outset
(at the suspect approach stage). If it becomes apparent after
approaching the suspect then an interpreter should be called as soon
as practicable.

Deaf people and people with speech difficulties. Any interview with
a deaf or partially hearing suspect or a suspect who has speech
difficulties should be recorded on tape with a written record of the
interview being recorded simultaneously. The interviewer shall make
sure that the interpreter as well as the suspect is allowed to read
the interview record and certify its accuracy as they may be called
to give evidence.

Foreign Languages. An interpreter will be required;

1.3.1 If the suspect has difficulty understanding English.

1.3.2 The interviewer cannot speak the suspect’s own language.
1.3.3 The suspect wants an interpreter present.

If the interview is recorded on tape there is no requirement for the
interpreter to make a note of the interview. If, however, the
interview is to be conducted by means of notes of interview an
Investigator shall make sure the interpreter makes a simultaneous
note of the interview in the person’s language, for use in the event
of the interpreter being called to give evidence. The interviewer
should allow sufficient time for the interpreter to note each
question and answer after each is put, given and interpreted. The
interpreter must certify the accuracy of the notes at the end. The
suspect must be allowed to read the interpreter’s record or have it
read to them and sign it as correct or indicate the respects in which
they consider it inaccurate.

Recording arrangements to obtain an interpreter. Any action taken to
call an interpreter must be recorded.

Payment for interpreters. Interpreters should be requested to submit
an invoice which will be paid by raising a purchase order.
Investigators should ask interpreters for a ball park cost figure as
this will enable a purchase order to be raised prior to the actual
invoice being received.

Obtaining Interpreters for Deaf People and People with Speech Difficulties

Whenever possible Investigators should ensure that any interpreter
engaged is registered on the National Register of Communication

Professionals working with Deaf and Deafblind People (NRCPD). The
register is accessible on the internet at http://www.nrcpd.org.uk

In order to engage the appropriate Communication Professional the
Investigator will have to know the particular language used by the
suspect as there are several types including;

2.2.1 British Sign Language (BSL).

2.2.2 Sign Supported English (SSE).

2.2.3 Lip Reading in conjunction with another.

2.3 The NRCPD website is user friendly and easy to follow. After getting
a list of names of potential interpreters the Investigator should
click on “Biography” next to the names. If the interpreter is not
prepared to be called out there will not be any contact numbers. If
there are contact numbers then the interpreter is available as
detailed. The register has interpreters in England, Wales, Scotland
and Northern Ireland.

Obtaining Foreign Language Interpreters

Whenever possible Investigators should ensure that any interpreter
engaged is registered on the National Register of Public Service
Interpreters (NRPSI). Access to this database is by subscription and
RM Security do not subscribe. As such if an Investigator needs an
interpreter at some date in the future they should attempt to obtain
an interpreter on the open market. Hints and tips on sourcing an
interpreter are detailed in paragraphs 3.2 & 3.3 below. If, however,
a foreign language interpreter is required urgently then contact
should be made with the local police as they may be able to assist in
obtaining an interpreter.

Internet Searches. The Institute of Translation and Interpreting has
a free “Directory of Members” from which interpreters can be drawn at
http://www.iti.org.uk/indexMain.html The following searches are
available;

3.2.1 Select “Directory of Members” - “Interpreters” - “Police &
Court”. Then enter the relevant language and the “Geographical
Location”. Click on relevant names to get their contact
details.

3.2.2 Select “Directory of Members” - “Interpreters” - “Business”.

Use the drop down menu “Specialisation” and select police.

Contacting Interpreters on the Telephone. Below is a table detailing

Unable to Contact an Interpreter

If Investigators are unable to arrange for an interpreter to be
present and the interview is not immediately necessary then the
interview should be delayed until an interpreter is present. (In
respect of searches consent from deaf people or people with speech
difficulties can be obtained in writing and in the case of foreign
languages over the telephone (see 4.5 below). If it is considered
that an immediate interview is necessary the following course of
action should be followed.

Deaf People or People with Speech difficulties. If necessary the
interview can commence by way of notes of interview if the suspect
agrees to do so in writing. Alternatively the suspect could attend a
Police station voluntarily and not under arrest so an interpreter can
be obtained. Should the suspect decline both then the assistance of
the police should be requested.

Foreign Languages. In the first instance the suspect should be asked
(using the telephone translator) to attend a Police station
voluntarily and not under arrest. If the suspect declines to go
voluntarily then the next course of action will be dependent on their
understanding of English. (Investigators should note that a suspect
may have a level of English but be more fluent in another language

and as such prefer the interview in their fluent language). If they
have a level of English and they consent to be interviewed then the
interview can commence without an interpreter, but only if a Senior
Investigation Manager (SIM) at BPC 8 or above considers that the
delay will lead to any of the 5 consequences detailed below and the
interview would not significantly harm the person’s physical or

mental state. (A record must be made of the grounds for the

decision).

4.3.1 Interference with, or harm to, evidence connected with an
offence;

4.3.2 Interference with, or physical harm to, other people or,

4.3.3 Serious loss of, or damage to, property;

4.3.4 The alerting of other people suspected of committing an
offence, but not yet apprehended for it or,

4.3.5 Hindering the recovery of property obtained in consequence of
the commission of an offence.

However once the risk has been averted the interview should be ceased

until an interpreter is present.

Should the suspect have insufficient understanding of English then
police assistance should be requested.

Knockhundred Translation Ltd provide a 24/7 telephone interpreter
services. To access this service telephone the Free-phone number 0800
731 7878. The pin number for RM Security account is KHO01. The
operator will arrange a conference call. Before calling try to
establish which language and dialect is required as this will save
time. In addition to the Investigator making notes of any
conversations they must ask the interpreter to make a record of them
as well. If attempting to get consent to search it is advised that
the forms, GS004 and GS005, are faxed or e-mailed to the interpreter
in order that they can document exactly what has been interpreted.

Briefing an Interpreter

Direct Approach. The interpreter should be asked to take the Direct
Approach to interpreting. That is to say the Investigator should talk
directly to the suspect and the interpreter should interpret the
exact words used. For example if an Investigator asks the suspect “I
want you to answer the question yes or no” the interpreter should say
in relevant language exactly what the Investigator said, “I want you
to answer the question yes or no”. The interpreter should not
rephrase the question to “he said that he wants you to answer the
question yes or no”. Additionally when answers are given by the
suspect the interpreter should state the exact words spoken without
rephrasing the answer.

Speed of interview. The Interpreter should be asked to keep the pace
of the interview down as this will aid all parties. Also they should
be told that if the interviewee speeds up the interpreter should ask
them to slow down and inform the Investigator that they have done so.

The interpreter should be briefed that they must not;

5.3.1 Speak on behalf of the suspect and answer questions for them.
They should merely interpret what the suspect says.

5.3.2 Engage in side conversations with the suspect. If anything
requires discussion the interpreter should discuss it with the
Investigator.

5.3.3 Talk at the same time as the Investigator or suspect.
