THE POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY

Third Witness Statement of Rachel Scarrabelotti

on behalf of Post Office Limited in the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry

1. 1, Rachel Scarrabelotti, of 100 Wood Street, London, EC2V 7ER, say as follows:

A. Introduction

2. I am Rachel Scarrabelotti, Company Secretary at Post Office Limited (‘Post
Office"). I joined Post Office in March 2022 and was appointed as Company
Secretary effective 12 April 2022. This is my Third Witness Statement to the Inquiry.
Whilst not having been employed by the Company during the whole of the period
in question relating to this Third Witness Statement, I am aware of the steps Post
Office has taken to respond to the Inquiry's Notice under Section 21 of the Inquiries
Act 2005, dated 12 January 2024 (the "S21(18) Notice"). As such, I am the

appropriate person to give this witness statement on behalf of Post Office.

3. This Third Witness Statement has been prepared in response to a request made
by the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry (the "Inquiry”) by email dated 29 February

2024 (the “Inquiry's Request"). The Inquiry's Request was to set out the

Page 1 of 93,
WITN11120300
WITN11120300

substance of Post Office’s letter to the Inquiry dated 28 February 2024 regarding
its response to the S21(18) Notice. The S21(18) Notice required, among other
things, a ‘list of all dates of meetings of the Board or other relevant governance
committees, sub-committees, or equivalent that are identified in Post Office
Limited's response to Rule 9 Request 49 ... dated 28 November 2023." \t further
required that the list ‘include all meetings between 1 January 2000 and the date on
which the second statement responding to Rule 9 Request 49 is signed, that date

being 19 February 2024 (the "Relevant Period”).

. I produce Exhibit RS/WS3/1 which sets out the product of Post Office’s work in

compliance with the S21(18) Notice.

. The S21(18) response was prepared in parallel with the work on R9(49). This
meant that as the R9(49) statement developed and further potentially relevant
committees were identified as part of that work, additional searches to identify
dates for the purposes of S21(18) had to be performed in case the committee was
assessed as “relevant” for the purposes of the R9(49) statement. If Post Office had
not taken this approach, it would not have been possible to meet the Inquiry’s
deadline for providing the statement. As a result of some additional searches
remaining outstanding at the date of the First Witness Statement being submitted
to the Inquiry, I also provide an update on some additional committees identified

by Post Office and its assessment of their relevance to request R9(49).

. I have aimed to include within this Third Witness Statement, evidence relating to
the Inquiry's Request insofar as the relevant facts are within my own knowledge.

The facts in this Third Witness Statement are true, complete and accurate to the

Page 2 0f 93,
WITN11120300
WITN11120300

best of my knowledge and belief. Where my knowledge and belief, as set out in this
Third Witness Statement, has been informed by another person or by documents
that I have reviewed, I acknowledge that person or those documents. I have been
assisted in preparing this Third Witness Statement by Burges Salmon LLP and
Fieldfisher LLP (together "BSFf"), who act on behalf of Post Office in the Inquiry. I
have had online meetings with BSFf to assist my preparation of this Third Witness

Statement.

. Post Office’s Process to Identify the Meeting Dates of Relevant Board,

Committees and Sub-Committees

. Post Office does not hold a record of the names of all of its Board level, Strategic
Executive Group (“SEG”) level or Business level committees and sub-committees
or of meeting dates for these committees during the Relevant Period in a single
repository or document. Accordingly, identifying the meeting dates of the relevant
committees and sub-committees has required Post Office to undertake a process
of searching document repositories to locate relevant material, reviewing that
material, and attempting to verify the status of the committee and the meeting dates
suggested by that material. Additionally, there has been engagement with those
working within the Company Secretariat to seek to identify additional potential
sources of information or answer questions about the status of a committee (Board
level, SEG level or other). Finally, Post Office reviewed the Company Secretariat's
Outlook Calendar in order to identify Board, Board level sub-committee and SEG

meeting dates.

WITN11120300
WITN11120300

8. Invitations for Board, Board Sub-committee and executive committee meetings
were issued from the Company Secretariat Outlook Calendar from June 2013 and
so the Company Secretariat Outlook Calendar only holds meeting dates from that
point onwards. Meetings are usually scheduled a year in advance in order to
ensure availability of those sitting on the Board or a committee. It is possible that
some of the meeting dates in the Company Secretariat Outlook Calendar — and set
out in associated lists/ schedules held in Post Office's Company Secretariat files —
may have been moved, postponed or cancelled and so it may be that the meeting
did not, in fact, take place on that date or at all. Post Office has included the dates
provided within the Company Secretariat Outlook Calendar, and the associated
lists/ schedules of dates, out of an abundance of caution where it has not been
possible to verify that the meeting went ahead on that date by reference to minutes
or an agenda from the same date. The lack of minutes or an agenda for a particular

date is not necessarily evidence that the meeting did not proceed.

9. From circa April 2012 onwards, post separation of the Post Office from the Royal
Mail Group, it was possible to identify a list of Board, Board level sub-committees
and SEG meeting dates from the sources described above at paragraph 8 and
from minutes and meeting documentation that Post Office holds. Post Office was
also assisted by review of Post Office’s Annual Company Report and Accounts
which, post separation, provide detail about Board level sub-committees and their

role.

10.The process outlined above identified a number of names of committees prior to

2012 but returned very few meeting dates. Post Office ran searches across a

Page 4 of 93,
WITN11120300
WITN11120300

number of workspaces in Relativity, including documents from the Postal Museum
and Hard Copy documents, that it identified as likely to hold potentially relevant
materials. Post Office has kept a detailed record of these searches but, in

summary, they proceeded in three stages:

a. Post Office ran general searches seeking to identify committees and sub-
committees that may have existed at Post Office prior to 2012.

b. Post Office ran targeted searches using the names of those committees
identified as a result of the searches at a. to identify meeting minutes or
terms of reference held, in order to assess their position within Post Office's
corporate structure and potential relevance to the matters under
investigation by the Inquiry.

c. Post Office identified those committees and sub-committees it considered
potentially relevant from all the materials, but for which it held limited
information about meeting dates, and ran targeted searches for those
minutes or other documents which might confirm the meeting date such as

agendas.

C. Meeting Dates of the Post Office Board, Relevant Committees and Sub-

Committees Identified

11.Through the above process, Post Office produced a list of meeting dates in
response to the S21(18) Notice, which is annexed to this Third Witness Statement
and which I produce as Exhibit RS/WS3/1. It includes the Board, committees and
sub-committees set out below:

a. Post Office Board.

Page 5 of 93,
WITN11120300
WITN11120300

b. SEG (formally the Group Executive post separation and the Executive Team
pre separation).

c. Audit Committee: From review of the documents made available to me, I
understand that this is a pre-2012 Board level sub-committee. My
understanding is that this committee was a precursor to the Audit and Risk Sub-
committee. Post Office has only been able to identify one meeting date of the
Audit Committee. Post Office holds incomplete records from pre-2012 and
unfortunately it has not been able to identify any further minutes from this
historical committee.

d. Audit and Risk Sub-Committee (“ARC”): This is a Board level sub-committee
which, based on a review of the documents made available to me, has existed
since 2012. The purpose of the ARC is to assist the Board with its fiduciary
duties by giving an independent view on accounting, financial control and
financial reporting, and providing oversight of risk management systems and
operational controls. The list of meeting dates has been prepared from review
of the minutes that Post Office holds, the Company Secretariat's Outlook
Calendar and the materials outlined at paragraph 8 above.

e. Risk and Compliance Committee: The Risk and Compliance Committee is now
a SEG sub-committee. However, from review of documents made available to
me, I understand that prior to 2012 the Risk and Compliance Committee was a
Board level sub-committee. My understanding is this committee was a
precursor to the Audit and Risk sub-committee, together with the Audit
Committee. Post Office has identified some meeting dates from minutes of this
committee from 2004-2011 and these are included in Exhibit RS/WS3/1. Post
Office has not been able to identify any further meeting dates for the pre-2012

Risk and Compliance Committee. Post Office holds minutes for the Risk and

Page 6 of 93,
WITN11120300
WITN11120300

Compliance Committee from 2013 onwards, but as the committee was SEG-
level by that point, these dates have not been included in Exhibit RS/WS3/1.
Remuneration Committee: This is a Board level sub-committee which, based
on a review of the documents made available to me, existed since 2012. The
purpose of the committee is to recommend to the Board the remuneration
strategy and changes to individual remuneration packages for senior level
appointments. The list of meeting dates has been prepared from review of the
minutes that Post Office holds, the Company Secretariat's Outlook Calendar
and the materials outlined at paragraph 8 above.

. Nominations Committee: This is a Board level sub-committee which has, based
on a review of documents made available to me, existed since 2012. The
purpose of the committee is to recommend appointments to the Board, its sub-
committees and approve the direct executive reports of the CEO. The list of
meeting dates has been prepared from review of the minutes that Post Office
holds, the Company Secretariat's Outlook Calendar and the materials outlined
at paragraph 8 above.

. Sparrow Sub-Committee: From review of the documents made available to me,
I! understand that this Board level sub-committee existed between 2014 and
2015. My understanding is that this sub-committee was established to make
recommendations to the Board in respect of Project Sparrow and provide
strategic oversight of the delivery of the project and the Initial Complaints and
Mediation Scheme. The list of meeting dates has been prepared from review of
the minutes that Post Office holds.

Mutualisation Sub-Committee: From review of documents made available to
me, I understand that this Board level sub-committee existed between 2012 and

2014. My understanding is that this sub-committee was established to provide

Page 7 of 93,
WITN11120300
WITN11120300

strategic direction in relation to Post Office's work on mutualisation and make
proposals in this regard to the Board. The list of meeting dates between 2012-
2014 has been prepared from review of the minutes that Post Office holds and
the Company Secretariat's Outlook Calendar.

Pensions Sub-Committee: From review of documents made available to me, I
understand that this Board level sub-committee existed since 2012. The sub-
committee's purpose is to make recommendations to the Board on pensions
and pre-retirement risk benefits, and put in place strategies in respect of Post
Office's pension fund. The list of meeting dates has been prepared from review
of the minutes that Post Office holds, the Company Secretariat's Outlook
Calendar and the materials outlined at paragraph 8 above. A Post Office

Pension Plan — Governance Group currently sits as a SEG sub-committee.

. Financial Services Sub-Committee: From review of documents made available

to me, I understand that this Board level sub-committee existed between 2014
and 2017. I understand the committee's purpose was to provide guidance,
oversight and authorisation in connection with Post Office's financial services.
The list of meeting dates has been prepared from review of the minutes that
Post Office holds, the Company Secretariat's Outlook Calendar and materials
outlined at paragraph 8 above.

Historical Remediation Sub-Committee: From review of documents made
available to me, I understand that this committee has existed from 2021
onwards as a Board level sub-committee. The purpose of this sub-committee
is to oversee the administration of the Horizon Shortfall Scheme, the HSS
Stamps Scheme, the management of compensation following overturned
convictions and Post Office's position on criminal appeals. The list of meeting

dates has been prepared from review of the minutes that Post Office holds and

Page 8 of 93,
WITN11120300
WITN11120300

the materials outlined at paragraph 8 above. I note this committee is now called
the ‘Remediation Committee’.

. Investment Sub-Committee: The investment committee was established as a

Board level sub-committee in September 2023. The purpose of this committee
is to oversee Post Office's investment activities and plans. The dates of
meetings from September 2023 onwards are included in Exhibit RS/WS3/1.
Post Office also had a SEG-level investment committee, which is a separate
body and therefore falls outside the scope of the S21(18) Notice. As stated in
my First Witness Statement (regarding Post Office’s historic governance
arrangements), I understand that the Executive-level investment committee
was established in 2007. During the course of further searches run over historic
material, Post Office has identified older investment committee minutes and
agendas from 2003 onwards. It has not been possible, within the time available
for complying with the Inquiry’s request, to establish whether at that time the
investment committee was a Board- or Executive- level committee. Due to the
lack of certainty on the historic status of this committee, Post Office has only
included meeting dates from 2023 onwards in Exhibit RS/WS3/1.
Annual and Interim Report Sub-Committee: From review of documents made
available to me, I understand that this was a Board level ad hoc sub-committee
which convened to discuss the draft Annual Reports and Accounts. The list of
meeting dates for this committee between 2011-2015 has been prepared from
review of the minutes that Post Office holds and the Company Secretariat's
Outlook Calendar.

. ARA Sub-Committee: As above, from review of documents made available to
me, I understand that the purpose of this sub-committee was to discuss Post

Office’s draft Annual Reports and Accounts. The list of meeting dates for this

Page 9 of 93,
WITN11120300
WITN11120300

Board level ad hoc sub-committee between 2014-2023 has been prepared from
review of the minutes held by Post Office in relation to this committee.

. Credit Card Sub-Committee: The list of meeting dates for this Board level sub-
committee has been prepared from review of the minutes held by Post Office in
relation to this sub-committee from 2019. From review of the documents made
available to me, my understanding is that the purpose of this sub-committee
was to discuss and make recommendations in connection with a credit card
contract.

. Eagle Sub-Committee: The list of meeting dates for this Board level sub-

committee has been prepared from review of the minutes held by Post Office in
relation to this sub-committee from 2011-2012. From review of the documents
made available to me, my understanding is that the purpose of this sub-
committee was to discuss and make recommendations in connection with a
financial services contract.
Funding Sub-Committee: The list of meeting dates for this Board level sub-
committee has been prepared from review of the minutes held by Post Office in
relation to this sub-committee from 2013. From review of the documents made
available to me, my understanding is that the purpose of this sub-committee
was to finalise a funding agreement with the Government.

. GLO Sub-Committee: The list of meeting dates for this Board level sub-
committee between 2018-2020 has been prepared from review of the minutes
held by Post Office in relation to this sub-committee, the Company Secretariat's
Outlook Calendar and the materials outlined at paragraph 8 above. From review
of the documents made available to me my understanding is that this sub-
committee was established to monitor the development of, and strategy for, the
group litigation.

WITN11120300

t. Health and Safety Sub-Committee: Post Office has identified two dates when
this sub-committee convened in 2008 and 2009. From review of the documents
made available to me my understanding is that the purpose of this committee
was to review health and safety related matters. Further searches of the
historical material identified additional health and safety-related committees.
However, Post Office has considered the same and formed the view that none
of the committees identified from the historic material are Board-level sub-
committees, and as such none of the meeting dates have been included in
Exhibit RS/WS3/1.

u. Panther Sub-Committee: Post Office has identified two meeting dates of this
Board level sub-committee from 2018 from review of the minutes Post Office
holds in relation to this sub-committee. From review of the documents made
available to me my understanding is that the purpose of this sub-committee was
to manage Project Panther, which concerned a contract unrelated to the matters
under investigation to the Inquiry.

v. RMG Sister Sub-Committee: Post Office has identified one meeting date of this
Board level sub-committee from 2012 from review of the minutes Post Office
holds in relation to this sub-committee. From review of the documents made
available to me my understanding is that this sub-committee was concerned
with the legal and transactional requirements for Post Office to become a sister

company with Royal Mail.

12.As explained at paragraph 5 above, additional searches were outstanding at the
date when my First Witness Statement was filed with the Inquiry. These
outstanding searches have led to the identification of additional Board sub-

committees that are not referenced in the Rule 9(49) historic statement, as follows:

Page 11 of 93,
WITN11120300
WITN11120300

a. Major projects expenditure committee / COMPEC: From review of the
documents made available to me this sub-committee appears to have been
concerned with the development of operational projects e.g. with
Parcelforce or Royal Mail. Post Office considers that it was likely a Board
sub-committee. The meeting dates Post Office has identified for this sub-
committee are from 1994 and 1996, which fall outside the required date
range of the S21(18) Notice.

b. Programme development authority board: From review of the documents
made available to me this sub-committee appears to have been concerned
with operational development and ICL Pathway. Post Office considers that
it was likely a Board sub-committee. The meeting dates Post Office has
identified for this sub-committee are from 1997, which fall outside the
required date range of the S21(18) Notice.

c. Accounts: From review of the documents made available to me 12this sub-
committee appears to have been an ad-hoc sub-committee to approve Post
Office Counters Limited's Annual Report and Accounts (Post Office
Counters Limited being the proceeding name to Post Office). Post Office
considers that it was likely a Board sub-committee. The meeting date Post
Office has identified for this sub-committee is from 1999, which falls outside
the required date range of the S21(18) Notice.

d. Sub-Committee of Directors: From review of the documents made available
to me, akin to the accounts committee, this appears to have been an ad-hoc
sub-committee to approve Post Office's interim reports and trading
statements, formed on occasion via a resolution of the Board. The meeting
dates Post Office has identified for this sub-committee range between 2012

— 2014.

Page 12 of 93,
WITN11120300
WITN11120300

13.The committees set out at paragraph 12 a to c fall outside the date range of the
$21(18) Notice. They have therefore not been included in the list at Exhibit
RS/WS3/1. In respect of the Sub-Committee of Directors (as set out at 12(d)
above), and based on Post Office's understanding that this was an ad hoc sub-
committee to approve interim reports and trading statements, Post Office assesses
that it is unlikely to be relevant to the matters under investigation. I have therefore
not included it within Exhibit RS/WS3/1; however, Post Office can provide further

information regarding this sub-committee if the Inquiry requires it.

14.The additional checks and searches over historical material have led to the
identification of committees / groups for which, due to the scarcity and age of the
documents, Post Office has not been able to take a view, in the time available, as
to where the committees sat within the business structure, as follows:

a. Programme steering committee: This appears to be akin to the programme
development authority board, concerned with ICL Pathways and Horizon
development. Post Office has identified meeting dates from 1997, but is
unable to confirm where the committee sat within the business structure.

b. Counter automation steering group: This also appears to be akin to the
programme development authority board and steering committee,
concerned with ICL Pathways and Horizon development. Post Office has
identified a meeting date from 1998, but is unable to confirm where the
steering group sat within the business structure.

c. Horizon programme board: This appears to have been a group / board

concerned with the development of Horizon. Post Office has identified

Page 13 of 93,
WITN11120300
WITN11120300

meeting dates from 1998 and 1999, but is unable to confirm where the
programme board sat within the business structure.

d. Strategy management team and risk management committee: These
appear to have been committees connected to strategic risk and controls,
and the document identified states that the strategy management team was
established in 1993 and risk management committee in 1995. Post Office
has not identified meeting dates and is unable to confirm where these
committees sat within the business structure.

e. CRTG Sub-Committee: Post Office understands this to be the co-operative
retail trading group and has identified a document in connection with this
from 2010, but has not identified any meeting dates. Post Office is unable to

confirm where this committee sat within the business structure.

15.1 note that the committees set out at paragraph 14 a to d fall outside the date range
of the S.21(18) Notice and Post Office has been unable to confirm where these
committees sat within the business structure. They have therefore not been
included in the list at Exhibit RS/WS3/1. As Post Office has not been able to confirm
the level at which the CRTG sat within the organisation and based on the above
understanding of its purpose, Post Office assesses that it is unlikely to be relevant
to the matters under investigation. I have therefore not included it within Exhibit

RS/WS3/1.

16.Post Office does not have complete records of its Board, Board sub-committees
and/or SEG level meetings. There are consequently gaps in the list of dates for

each committee at Exhibit RS/WS3/1. It has, however, carried out a significant

Page 14 of 93,
WITN11120300
WITN11120300

review exercise, as explained in this statement, to try to identify historical meeting

dates and assure itself that the dates contained in Exhibit RS/WS3/1 are accurate.

Statement of Truth
I believe the content of this statement to be true.
