Many thanks for this — I have yet to read it but Mark Underwood (ccd) and I will make sure it reaches FJ at the
appropriate time — I note the reservation language.

Best wishes

Patrick

All

Please find attached the updated note on remote access following the call with FJ. I've also had some more
information from Deloitte that I have included in the note.

Andy H — would you mind reviewing this as I think you had spotted some technical errors in the language used.

Belinda / Patrick — this can then be sent to FJ. As mentioned previously, please can the covering email include a
statement along the following lines:

"This draft document, and any communications or other documents associated with it, are confidential, privileged and
prepared in contemplation of litigation. They must be kept confidential and not disclosed to any other person."

Or I can send this to FJ if that helps?

Kind regards
Andy
