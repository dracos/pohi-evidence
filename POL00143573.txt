I attach my mark ups. I have had several days holiday so apologise for not having been able to respond earlier.

Whilst I have proposed a fairly significant rewording of the lengthy “losses and gains” paragraph I would also like to
query whether we actually need such a long section there at all.

We are robustly stating to Mr Popov that we rebut his assertion about equipment and robustly believe the extra
controls he finally introduced are the thing that made the difference. On that basis don’t we risk opening an
unnecessary avenue of dispute by getting into the miskeyed “loss and gain” arena?

Could that paragraph simply be reduced to its first sentence?

le. “However, losses do occur across our network for a number of different reasons. These include staff or agent theft
and customer fraud. ”

If you strongly feel that Mr Popov’s original concerns required the length of comment then I would prefer my
rewording, but I have read his original complaint and I don’t think we need to get into keying issues in such detail to
respond to his question.

I’ve also suggested some grammatical points.

Am around to discuss o1

Thanks, Rod

Whilst I appreciate that this is short notice, the case is very overdue, and we have already had a follow up
