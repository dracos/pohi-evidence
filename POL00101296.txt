Hi all

Further to Chris' update last week about Second Sight's "Part Two" report, we have today been approached by a BBC
North reporter who has clearly seen a copy of the Report and Post Office's subsequent letter to applicants. As Chris
explained last week, we are well prepared for this eventuality.

I understand that BBC North plan to run a story on Monday about the Report. We have a short but firm line on which
we will hold. This will state that leak is highly regrettable and not in interests of applicants, and confirm our position is
that the report is inaccurate.

We will not comment further and it is essential we hold on that position to avoid giving the story unnecessary

oxygen. We will work hard to keep a lid on it, though clearly other outlets, including those who have previously

reported on the issue, may follow up on anything run by BBC North.

We are informing the Working Group as a matter of courtesy and making it clear that Post Office will not be drawn into
commenting on matters which are confidential to the Scheme.

I will monitor the situation closely and update you if the position changes.
Best wishes,

Mark
