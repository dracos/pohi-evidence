My own view is that it is most likely that they told JFSA who told JA. Point remains though

Agree. Having got to the point where (after a long time) we are sort of in charge, we should make sure they know it.

All

It has just occurred to me (appreciate I may be a bit slow on this one) that it must have been SS that told James Arbuthnot
about their termination as only SS knew about the document destruction issue.

If we are being true to the terms of the Work Plan letter sent to SS, which reinforced the confidentiality obligations and
revoked SS' consent to speak to JA, then we should send a follow-up letter to SS saying that we note that they have
breached these obligations despite our warning.

The letter need not be aggressive but by pulling them up on each little infringement we make sure SS do not see these
are idle threats. We also avoid any suggestion that we have waived these obligations through doing nothing; this may be
important down the line if there is a more serious breach that we do want to enforce.

Thoughts?
