UPDATE ON DISCUSSIONS WITH GOVERNMENT ON LONG
TERM INCENTIVE PLAN

The Committee approved the draft letter to the DTI which set out
the calculations for the 2005-07 Long Term Incentive Plan.

ANNUAL BONUS 2006/07

The Committee approved the paper setting out the bonus
consequences for the Executive Director and the Chairman. It
was agreed that a letter would be sent to the DTI asking if there
were any comments they wished to make.

The Committee approved the principles which had been used in
the ‘top 140 Levelling’ exercise, but asked for the figures to be
recalculated so that the total cost of the exercise would be within
£20,000 of cost neutral.

Royal Mail Letters. The Committee approved in principle that an
‘underpin’ could be applied to the bonuses awarded in Royal Mail
Letters which would guarantee certain minimum levels. The
Chairman asked that he be provided with a note giving further
information on the average difference this would make to those
affected.

LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLAN RULES

Members were asked to consider the amendments proposed to
the formal plan rules and to give their comments at the following
meeting.

annual base salary of £245,000.
