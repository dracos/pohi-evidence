Morning

This is the third email I have had to send to plead for an answer to yet another
‘Horizon’ failure.

I realise that you will not acknowledge proven ‘Horizon’ errors due to forthcoming
tribunals/Court cases and press interest.

However I have again highlighted an error which causes misbalancing and losses to
the meagre Subpostmaster a situation which really ought to be made public, but as I
know your heavy handed tactics prevent anyone from following this path.

Please don't bother sending my ‘Contracts Manager’ again to put the frighteners on.

By copy of this email would George Thompson extract his digit and have this sorry

situation public.
