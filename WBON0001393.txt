Dear Sirs

POST OFFICE GROUP LITIGATION
TRANSACTION CORRECTIONS AND BRANCH TRADING STATEMENT FLOWCHARTS

We write further to your email of 14 December 2018 (timed at 15:43), appending your proposed
flowcharts. Our comments are noted below.

TC Flowchart

We have considered the flow chart you have provided in relation to TCs, and made amendments as
shown on the attached document.

You will note that we have:

Amended references to SPMR to SPM.

Added in the “SPM chooses to deal with TC later” box “(select ‘cancel’)’.

Added an arrow from “No, TC does not need to be processed now’ to link it to the box to
the left (and removed the underlining from “not”).

Removed from the box beginning “Horizon shows details of the TC selected...” the words in
parentheses “i.e. evidence and details of POL individual to contact if SPM has queries” —
this is because the evidence at trial was that this information was not always provided
and/or was not always clear.

5. Changed the wording in relation to “Settle Centrally” to more neutrally reflect the position.

- ONS

In relation to the “Seek Evidence” option, there was no evidence at trial as to what would be the
effect of selecting this option. Please provide documentary reference(s) as to the effect of selecting
this option so we can consider it now.

Subject to the above, we think it may be helpful for the judge to have both TC flowcharts (the attached
version and the version that we sent to you on 14 December, by email timed at 18:22), as they have
slightly different focuses (in that our version more clearly shows the actual buttons available). Please
confirm if you agree.

Branch Trading Statement Flowchart

We would be agreeable to this flowchart being provided to the Judge, if the documentary references
are removed, as there was no detailed evidence of this nature before the Court. We have provided
an amended version accordingly for you to consider.

We look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible with a view to finalising these documents
today, for filing at 4pm.

Yours faithfully
