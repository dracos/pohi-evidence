Well done mark. In the circumstances this feels quite balanced.

All

This is the BBC online report around Horizon. Earlier inaccuracies have been
corrected and our clear line included. We will continue to monitor coverage,
though it is pleasingly low on BBC schedules.

We will update Board in morning. BIS are aware and in loop. Jo Swinson has
requested a brief for the morning - we are working with Richard Callard on that.

Worth reminding ourselves that this is what we expected to happen and in the
current news agenda this is not likely to stay in the news cycle for long.

Please do let me know any queries.
Mark
