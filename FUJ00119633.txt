The Horizon Online application is running in 608
branches.

Medium Volume Pilot halted for 2 weeks following Branch
database issues in live 03/03/10 — 05/03/10. Restarted
on 18/03/10, and High Volume Pilot started 25/03/10 but
migrations suspended for 26/03/10 after live outages.
The final rollout profile continues to be assessed by the
Programme and Service teams and remains subject to
approval by the Internal and Joint Release Authorisation
Boards.

Reverted to Amber (from Green) due to likely over-run of
programme and additional costs incurred.

National Federation of Subpostmasters complaining over
outages on 26/03/10. Loss of confidence after last 2
weeks had shown improvement in live stability.
