I   Background Information on the Horizon system


The Horizon system was initially put together as a pilot in 1996, and following
an extensive pilot was rolled out to all Post Offices between 1999 and 2002.
It has recently been replaced by the Horizon Online system which was piloted
at the start of 2010 and the last Horizon system was replaced in September
2010.


Within Horizon, each Post Office stores details of all its transactions on the
Hard disk of each PC within the Branch. There is a separate PC for each
counter position. I understand that at Branch 126023 there are 3 counter
positions and hence 3 PCs.


Data from the branch is transmitted from each branch to Fujitsu's Data
Centres using a variety of Communications mechanisms. The software used
to transmit the data from the Branches to the Data Centre is specifically
designed to ensure that whenever contact is made between the Branch and
the Data Centre any outstanding data is exchanged between the two.                           In
particular for many transactions there is no need for the Branch to be online.


I understand that there is a suggestion that the equipment in the Branch may
be faulty. I am not aware of any fundamental issues (though this is being be
covered by Mr Dunks). I have also been showen the witness statement of Mr
Varsani who I understand took over the Branch from the defendant, which

2 Comments on Professor McLachlan's Report


I have examined the "Technical expert's report to the Court prepared by
Charles Alastair McLachlan, a Director of Amsphere Consulting Ltd" which I
received on 1 St October 2010. I have been asked by Post Office Ltd to
provide a statement regarding to my views on the report with regard to the
Horizon system and also about my analysis of the data regarding the
transactions carried out in Branch 126023 which I understand to be the
Branch that the defendant managed.


I would like to re-iterate that my expertise relates to the Horizon system only
and not to Post Office Ltd's Back end systems. However such systems are
irrelevant to the Branch accounts that are produced on Horizon since any
externally initiated transactions (such as Transaction Corrections and
Remittances which will be discussed later) must be authorised by a User of
the Horizon system in the Branch before they are included in the Branch's
accounts.


In Section 1.2 of his report, Professor McLachlan lists a number of
"Hypothetical issues" with the Horizon system.                                 However there doesn't
appear to be any real a thorough justification as to why these might be
relevant. The purpose of these statements appears to be to plant seeds of
doubt without a factual basis.

Specifically, in section 1.2.1 he hypothesises that "The User Interface gives rise to
incorrect data entry: poor user experience design and inadequately user experience testing can give

rise to poor data entry quality.' . Although I was not responsible for the Design and
development of the Horizon user interface, I do know that one of the key
goals of the User Interface was that it would be easy to use and that it could
be used by Users with no IT experience.

In Section 1.2.2 there is the hypothesis that 'The Horizon system fails to properly
process transactions: accounting systems are usually carefully designed to ensure that accounts
balance after each "double entry" transaction.'                                Horizon iS indeed designed to use

"double entry" transactions. Further Professor McLachlan refers to the need
for database systems to use "two-phase' commit" technologies. Again, Horizon

Finally, in Section 1.2.3 there is the Hypothesis that "External systems across the
wider Post Office Limited Operating Environment provide incorrect externally entered information
to the Horizon accounts through system or operator error outside Horizon.".                                        I am not quite

clear what Professor McLachlan is referring to here. However what I can say
is that any transaction that is recorded on Horizon must be authorised by a
User of the Horizon system who is taking responsibility for the impact that
such a transaction has on the Branch's accounts. There are no cases where
external systems can manipulate the Branch's accounts without the Users in
the Branch being aware and authorising the transactions.

In Section 2.2.1 of his report, Professor McLachlan outlines a number of
limitations in the scope of his investigation. In some of these cases, they are
irrelevant to the processing of transactions in Horizon.


Specifically, the report States "It was not possible to examine the process for introducing
Transaction Corrections that can give rise to changes in the cash that Horizon records at the
branch".      As I have stated earlier in this statement, any Transaction Correction
that has been generated by the external Post Office Ltd systems must be
explicitly accepted into the Branch's accounts by an appropriate User. In
many cases there is the opportunity to reject the Transaction Correction
allowing a separate process to agree whether or not it is valid before it is
accepted into the accounts.                           In particular there are 3 examples of this
occurring:          Firstly on 13th December 2006 and for two other transaction
Corrections on 14th March 2007.                                Therefore, I would say that it is not
necessary to examine the process for generating Transaction Corrections.


It may be helpful at this point to explain what a Transaction Correction is. It is
a mechanism whereby staff in Post Office Ltd's Head Office can request a
sub-postmaster to undertake a transaction that amends the branch's
accounts. This process is used when an error is identified by some manual
means and it is necessary to correct this in the Branch's accounts. I do not
understand Post Office Ltd's processes well enough to provide an example.
However when such a Transaction Correction is being processed a message
is shown on the screen to the user so that they                                   aware of what its effect
                                                                            are

differences. Therefore, I would say that it is not necessary to examine the
process for generating Remittances.


The third bullet States "It was not possible to examine the processes for revaluing foreign
currency which could change the value of cash held at the branch.". Revaluation of currency

doesn't affect the cash position. It purely affects the notional value of the
Foreign Currency as it is reported in the accounts, but has no impact on the
Cash (sterling) position.                    It's only impact might be on the liability of the
postmaster for any currency that is subsequently lost (which would need to
be repaid at the current value). Note that revaluation can be positive or
negative.


Finally, the 4 bullet States "Tt was not possible to examine the processes of reconciliation
conducted by the Post Office that could give rise to Transaction Corrections.".     AS Stated
earlier this is not really relevant since any Transaction Corrections will have
been accepted by the User into the Branch accounts and should not be
accepted if not understood. Accepting a Transaction Correction implicitly
means taking responsibility for that in accounting terms.


Moving on to Section 2.2.2 of Professor McLachlan's report which is titled
Opportunities for Reconciliation. I accept that the Horizon system has not
been designed to automatically provide vouchers for every transaction. It
was not a requirement for Horizon to produce such vouchers and in fact there
were specific requirements from Post Office Ltd regarding transaction times

that preclude printing such records. This was so as to minimise the time
taken to serve each customer and so attempt to keep queue sizes down to a
reasonable length. My experience as a user of Retail systems (such as
supermarkets) is that such vouchers are not normally generated there either.


In Section 2.3 of his report, Professor McLachlan looks at hypothetical issues
with Data Entry. Section 2.3.1 looks at the calibration of the touch screen. I
accept the fact that a misaligned touch screen could certainly cause
confusion to the User and result in incorrect buttons being activated.
However I don't understand how Professor McLachlan is suggesting that
such a misalignment would cause discrepancies within the accounts.
Perhaps he would like to provide an example of where such an error may
have occurred?


In section 2.3.2, Professor McLachlan states that "Poor user interface design can
contribute to poor data entry quality and user errors.".                   I agree with this aS a Statement.
However Professor McLachlan makes no attempt to explain in what way the
Horizon User Interface design is "Poor". As I stated earlier one of the key
goals of the User Interface was that it would be easy to use and that it could
be used by Users with no IT experience. A significant amount of effort was
put into designing and agreeing the User Interface with Post Office Ltd.

         3. The Customer session was settled to Cash (which could have been
             accidental).             However in all such cases the transaction was
             subsequently reversed resulting in the cash also being reversed.


         There are business rules that control whether transactions can be
         cancelled or if they have to be committed and then reversed (which is
         the main difference between cases 2 and 3 above). I suspect (but can't
         necessarily prove) that in case 2 the sessions were for purchase of
         Foreign Currency.                  I case 3 the sessions were all for purchase of
         Premium Bonds.


         I think this refutes the assertion that failed Debit Card Payments are the
         cause of the losses,




which took place on 11th January 2007 and states that this could have been
processed as Fast Cash. I have re-checked this transaction        , A-oi

in error for Fast Cash, then there would have been a discrepancy in the value
of cheques and there is no evidence of such discrepancies.


Later in this section, Professor McLachlan claims "the 'Fast Cash' button is
demonstrated to be a source of data entry error (the reversals confirm this).".     I don't agree
with that. I can see no evidence to support this statement. The fact that
there are reversals following a failed Debit card transaction is due to the fact
that some transactions cannot be abandoned and need to be settled and
then reversed. This was a specific requirement on Horizon from Post Office
Ltd. The fact that this has been done shows that the user was well aware of
the failure of the Debit Card transaction and followed normal process when
the failure occurred.


Professor McLachlan explores issues with training of the Users in section
2.3.4 of his report. I support his finding regarding discrepancies in cash in
almost every period. In particular, he States: "The Declared Branch position had
discrepancies vis-d-vis the Horizon totals at the end of almost every period." and "The Variance
Checks conducted to reconcile the branch position vis-a-vis Horizon showed a discrepancy on the
vast majority of occasions ranging from 18 pence to more than £1. .1.,000,".    I agree with both
these statements. However to me these seem to indicate at the least poor
management within the Branch and probably something more serious.


What is meant by the first statement is that when a Stock Unit is being
Balanced (which is a process that occurs at least once each month) a

I also did an analysis of the daily cash movements compared with the daily
cash declarations and could see very little correlation between the two which
indicates that the variances between the declared cash and the system cash
figures were not being monitored very well within the Branch. I would agree
that this could be down to Theft / Fraud, or incompetence by the Branch staff.
I would have thought that seeing such variances would have alerted the sub-
postmaster that there was a problem and to investigate what is going on.

However there is no evidence that this is down to any sort of System failure.
Further I would suggest that small discrepancies are to be expected in such
an environment due to mistakes in giving change etc. My understanding is
that Post Office investigators expect such small discrepancies in normal
operation.

I accept that there was an issue with the Post Office in Calendar Square
Falkirk as descried in the email reproduced in Appendix C of the report and
covered by a previous Witness statement I made on 8" February 2010. As I
stated in the email, the problem was fixed in March 2006 and so is not
relevant to the period of data that I have examined in this branch. Also, when
the problem manifested itself it was clear from the various logs that there was
a problem in the system. There is no evidence of such problems from the
various logs that have been examined for this branch. Therefore I see no
relevance for this problem to the period of data that is being looked at for this
case. In particular, Professor McLachlan says "It demonstrates that there have been
faults with the Horizon system which give rise to discrepancies that can cause losses. It is not
reasonable to exclude the possibility of system problems when considering a case such as Misra. ".

I would dispute that. It was clear from the Events generated at the time in
Calendar Square that there was a problem. No such events have been seen
in West Byfleet in the period in question and so this cannot be responsible for
the losses in that period.


To simplify matters, I've included a summary of the issue that is included in
Appendix C of Professor McLachlan's report:


          I've now dug back into the archives to provide the following summary:

In section 2.4.2 Professor McLachlan describes a "travellers cheque stock problem".
I disagree with his description of what happens in this scenario. Horizon
doesn't attempt to control Travellers' Cheques at a denominational level. In
other words it only manages the total value (in dollars) of Travellers' Cheques
and doesn't distinguish between $1,000 being held as 10 $100 Travellers'
Cheque or as 50 $20 Travellers' Cheques or any other combination. Horizon
is only concerned with the fact that it holds Travellers' Cheques to a face
value of $1,000.                             Therefore following through Professor McLachlan's

scenario, the system initially has $1,000 of Travellers' Cheques. When a
customer purchases one Travellers' Cheque for $100, then this will be
reflected by reducing the stock of Travellers' Cheques by 100, leaving 900
Travellers' Cheques in stock. This would be reflected on the Stock Report.


I also note that in this section Professor McLachlan states that he has
discussed this scenario with me and that I "acknowledge that this is a known feature of
Horizon and that the Post Office have not instructed Fujitsu to change the system to produce a

meaningful stock report.".            I don't recall any such discussion. I have seen such a
scenario described in a separate report that Professor McLachlan has written
for a separate case, and did explicitly check out the scenario and produced a
report for Post Office Ltd refuting the description.

In Section 2.5.1, Professor McLachlan looks again at Transaction
Corrections. Here he refers to Appendix G of his report which describes
some analysis I have done concerning transaction Corrections (my email on
this is actually is in Appendix D of the report). This shows that if we analyse
all Transaction Corrections during the 13 month period that the net value is
£1,840.          I've subsequently gone over the data again and found some
additional transaction corrections that have been processed and the total net
value of all such Transaction Corrections is actually slightly less namely
£1,619.43.


He then refers to a slightly wider scope that he has taken in Appendix J
where he comes up with an absolute value of £82,918.35 (though a net value
of £19,257.21). I have now had a chance to examine this data in more detail

and have the following observations to make on Professor McLachlan's
analysis:


    o     Many of the figures listed do not represent Transaction Corrections


    o     A number of the figures that do relate to a Transaction Correction do
          not affect the Cash Position, since those particular Transaction
          Corrections were used to correct the value of cash pouches that were
          in the branch awaiting collection or Remittance errors held in
          Suspense.


This results in a net total of Cash Transaction Corrections of £302.72 and
even adding up the absolute values as Professor McLachlan has done
(though I don't understand why) only results in a total of £5,167.28.


My findings are presented in a separate document.


Later on in the section Professor McLachlan states "There is no record of Misra
requesting evidence in the transactions provided between 1 Dec 06 and 31 Dec 07. ".   Thi3 iS
incorrect. There was one such example on 13th December 2006 and two
more on 14th March 2007. I accept that I had omitted these from my initial
analysis.

Finally, towards the end of the section Professor McLachlan hypothesises
"There are missing Transaction Corrections which would reduce the cash balance expected by the

Horizon system (i.e. be in favour of Misra).". Th4&m                                                  fei        g.: =                  I' € ` not dear

understanding is that normally branches are well aware of such errors and
would have contacted Post Office Ltd to enquire as to why no Transaction
Correction was being made in favour of the branch.


Section 2.5.2 of the report discusses remittances.                                                                                However I don't

Section 2.5.3 then refers to incorrect transaction processing. However there
is no indication as to what types of transaction processing may be incorrect,
or as to what sort of errors the users may have made. It should be noted that
the Horizon counter application has recently been replaced and the last
Horizon Counter migrated to the new system in September 2010 and so
there are no longer any Horizon counter systems to examine.

Professor McLachlan's report than attempts to draw some conclusions in
section 3.


Section 3.1 queries why it took Post Office Ltd so long to notice the pattern of
discrepancies.                    Much           of the          detailed          information regarding                         such
discrepancies is only available within the branch to assist the sub-postmaster
in managing their branch and so is not routinely available to Post Office Ltd
until an investigation is carried out as in this case.

Section 3.3 refers to Horizon issues. As stated earlier, the Calendar Square

Finally in 3.4 is challenging the integrity of Post Office Ltd's back end
