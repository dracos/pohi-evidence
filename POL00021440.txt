4 MANAGEMENT OF KEY OPERATIONAL RISKS

Irrelevant

Classification of Group Litigation Costs

Following a request from the Board, the classification of spend
associated with Group litigation was being reviewed with EY. Litigation
had traditionally been accounted for as an operating cost and charged
to EBITDAS. However, the view of the Board was that litigation was not
a cost of trading. The Chairman noted that the impact of any decision
in this area on both short and long term incentive plans would need to
be considered by the Company’s Remuneration Committee.

Separately, AC advised that he was working to ensure that any off-balance sheet
financing was reported as transparently as possible.

PV, TP and JH joined the meeting.

(b) Litigation

As a result of the Postmaster litigation, the recovery of agent losses and
prosecutions have become significantly more challenging, thereby
increasing the risk that the deterrent effect of such recovery actions or
prosecutions will be diminished. However, AC advised that more targeted
audits had resulted in issues being identified earlier. As a result, agent
losses had stabilised during Q3 2017/18. In response to a query from KM
as to where agent losses figures should be reported, AC advised that they
were covered in detail in the Conduct Report which would be presented
at the March 2018 Board meeting. The Chairman advised that she was
happy for the figures to be reported wherever thought appropriate, so
long as they were reported.

BF left the meeting. MD joined the meeting.
