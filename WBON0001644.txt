Hi Mark,

Please see the note below which addresses the queries raised last week by the GLO Steering committee, can
you please circulate as required.

During the controlled shutdown or restart there is a very low risk of data loss. The architecture of SAP
separates the application from the database and once shutdown the database can still be copied, moved or
accessed by other means. The likelihood of any data corruption is very low, this activity is carried out
regularly on the Accenture hosted POLSAP application.

In regards to the move from Remedy to POLSAP, the key difference is the migration work has already been
completed successfully and validated by a third party. We are not moving the application or hardware but
simply restarting the application in a controlled fashion.

Once the system has been restarted thorough checks will be performed to validate the data, in both the
application and the database itself. In the event that further validation is required the copied system that is
now hosted by Accenture can be used to validate the database.

Kind Regards,

e Craig Bibby
IT Service Manager
