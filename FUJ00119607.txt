Introduction

This defines the content and production plan for the document:
“ICL Pathway Generalised API for OPS/TMS”
This document is for internal Pathway use by application developers.

It is also to be supplied under the Contract (in compliance with Requirements R469,
R470 and R869%part)) to POCL for the purpose of enabling POCL to procure
applications to run on the Service Infrastructure (i.e. interfacing with OPS and TMS).
As such it will be provided to Third Parties.

The OPS Architecture Specification describes the architecture for counter applications
operating within the OPS/TMS framework, and describes the interaction of counter
applications with OPS and TMS. The document expands on the architecture set out in
the OPS Architecture Specification.

Scope

The document is intended for application developers within ICL Pathway or Third
Parties. The purpose of the document is to enable developers to understand the
architecture employed and the facilities available within the ICL Pathway solution,
utilising OPS, TMS and EPOSS. The document is intended to provide developers
with sufficient details to plan the development of new applications operating in this
environment. The developers may be ICL Pathway staff, POCL staff or Third Parties.
The document will contain definitions of those Pathway specific APIs essential to
utilising OPS, TMS and EPOSS.

In the context of the Contract, it is available to POCL to enable the procurement
process. Any supplier of Riposte based applications must obtain a development
licence from Escher, who would supply the reference manuals for the Escher specific
APIs:

Escher Group Ltd.
101 Main Street
Cambridge
Massachusetts
USA

Document Standards

ICL Pathway shall produce the document in accordance with the ICL Pathway On-
Line Standards for document production. In essence, the document shall conform to a
standard template, be written in Microsoft Word and shall be subject to a document
review cycle, with comments and responses being formally recorded.

A draft of the document shall be produced and reviewed within ICL Pathway
according to the ICL Pathway Document Review Process. A baseline version
incorporating changes from the review will be submitted to POCL.

A formal review of the comments received at the end of the review period, assumed to
be 2 weeks, will be conducted with representatives of POCL. The review meeting
will agree the method of resolution of all comments raised.

A revised version of the document incorporating agreed changes will be baselined and
introduced into the Core Documentation Set under CCN.

Content of ICL Pathway Generalised API for OPS/TMS

This shall be as follows.

Introduction

This section describes who the document is intended to be read by, and the
conventions used.

Context

This identifies the relationship of this document to the OPS Architecture
Specification, which describes the Retail Broker, Peripheral Broker and Riposte
OCXs used in application development and how applications should be developed. It
identifies also the relationship to the TMS Architecture Specification that defines the
way Riposte facilities are used across the TMS domain. The relationship to the
Access Control Policy and OPS Style Guide is also defined.

Scope

The document provides a description of the context in which the APIs are used for the
application developer. These are expressed in terms of the business functions
supported by EPOSS, the application functionality supported by OPS/TMS, and other
application interfaces that need to be supported in the OPS/TMS environment.

The document will define APIs that have been created or modified by Pathway. It will
list any relevant Escher supplied APIs and will list Riposte APIs that are excluded
from the Pathway implementation.

Business Functions

EPOS

This section describes the concept of the ‘Sale’ of a product, its relationship to POCL
Reference Data and the data structures involved.

Settlement

This section defines the concepts used in the settlement of a customer session, the
impact of session transfer and how settlement data is sent to clients.

Stock Unit Management

This section identifies the concepts involved in the use of Stock Units, defines the
difference between shared and individual stock units and describes the data structures
involved.

Reporting

This section will describe the reporting functions that are available to the application
developer.

It will identify how a Cash Account is constructed using Reference Data and will
describe the data structures involved. It will cover the way receipts are produced and
cross refer to the document Horizon OPS Reports and Receipts.

Balancing

This section covers the way a Stock Unit balance is achieved and its relationship to
the office level Cash Account.

Application Functions

Architecture

This section will cross refer to the appropriate sections in the OPS Architecture
Specification.

Peripheral Server Interfaces

This describes the interface provided to support the use of input and output devices.

Retail Broker Interfaces

This describes the interfaces needed to add the sale of a product as a transaction to the
stack (list of transactions in the current session) presented to the clerk, to cancel
transactions and deal with any additional processing required at the point when a
session is settled.

Desktop Interfaces

This chapter describes how the desktop interface is controlled by the use of standard
OCXs and identifies those available for use by the application developer and those
controlled by the system.

Riposte Functions

This chapter describes the interfaces needed to handle messages and persistent
objects.

databases as well as the location of existing objects and the creation of new ones.

4.5.5.3 Parsing Functions

This section describes the concept of attribute grammar and how attribute grammar
and messages are parsed.

(A)Appendix - Systems Management and Key
Management

This Appendix is subject to Non Disclosure Agreement
Systems Management

This document expands on the Systems Management information outlined in section
4.9.

In particular, this section defines how software comprising new applications is to be
handed over to ICL Pathway for system integration testing, also the documentation
needed to support such handovers. For instance, such documentation must include
program specifications and must list all the exception conditions catered for, together
with resource requirements.

The section defines the way that EXEs, OCXs and DLLs are packaged for distribution
and support purposes.

Key Management

Where a new application may employ encryption, Pathway anticipates that discussions
with the Supplier of the new application will be initiated at the earliest appropriate
stage. This section gives details of the functions for key management in the Pathway
environment including the distribution of keys to post offices.
