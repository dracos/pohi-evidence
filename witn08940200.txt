                                                       Witness Name: Robert Daily

                                                       Statement No.: WITN08940200

                                                       Dated: 27 December 2023




                         POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY




                  SECOND WITNESS STATEMENT OF ROBERT DAILY




I, Robert Daily, will say as follows:



Infrr r1iirfinn



1.    I make this second witness statement to assist the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry

      (the "Inquiry") with the matters set out in the further Rule 9 Request I have

      received, via my solicitors, dated 8 December 2023 (the "Second Request"). I

      have received advice and assistance from a lawyer in the preparation of this

      statement.

Clarification of matters in my first witness statement


2.    I have also reviewed the first witness statement I made dated 7 November 2023

      (my "First Witness Statement"), together with the Core Bundle that the Inquiry

      sent to me, in preparation for my giving oral testimony to the Inquiry. In doing so

      I have reflected further on some of the events that I described, and have spotted

      an error in one of the documents exhibited to my statement:

                                        Page 1 of 14
                                                                                    WITN08940200
                                                                              WITNO8940200




2.1   Paragraph 6 of my First Witness Statement notes that I was asked to

      consider a document (at [POL00105143]), a copy of my CV for the period

      2005 to 2008. This is the document at Exhibit B1 of my First Witness

      Statement.


2.2   When I reviewed this document again, I realised that there was a mistake

      with   the   qualifications   listed    under   the   heading   "Educational

      Achievements". The qualifications listed there are actually my wife's. My

      recollection is that when I was asked to prepare this CV, I didn't have a

      template or an example to work from, so my wife gave me a copy of a

      CV she had written for me to use. What seems to have happened is that

      I wrote an account of my knowledge, experience and additional

      qualifications, but forgot to amend the list of educational qualifications.


2.3   Paragraph 7 of my First Witness Statement notes that I was asked to

      consider a document (at [POL00129121]), which I said appeared to be a

      statement I made in support if an application for the role of Investigation

      Manager. This is the document at Exhibit B2 of my First Witness

      Statement.


2.4   I said that I thought this document dated from either 2008 or 2014, when

      I had to apply for my role as an Investigation Manager during

      organisational restructures. Having reflected on this, I now believe that I

      wrote this document in connection with the role of Investigation Manager,

      which I described having applied for in 2004, at paragraph 5 of my First

      Witness Statement. My recollection now is that this document was written

      at the end of the initial temporary six month period, before I was


                               Page 2 of 14
                                                                                   WITN08940200
                                                                                 WITNO8940200




      permanently appointed to this role. This would have been in late 2005 or

      early 2006.


2.5   At paragraph 25 of my First Witness Statement, I said "I believe that from

      2006 all reports all non-Police authorities were required to be submitted

      to the COPFS [the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service]

      electronically". Firstly, there is a typo in this sentence ("... all reports all

      non-Police authorities..." should read "...all reports from non-Police

      authorities...). Secondly, I believe the date I gave is likely incorrect. I now

      think that it was from 2009 or 2010 (and not 2006) that reports to COPFS

      had to be submitted electronically.


2.6   Paragraph 112 of my First Witness Statement notes that I was asked if

      any Horizon data (and, in particular, ARQ logs) were requested from

      Fujitsu in connection with the prosecution of Mr Peter Holmes. Referring

      to what I had written in my investigation report (the document at

      [POL00050334], Exhibit B42 to my First Witness Statement, which said

      that "Horizon data had been requested") I said in my First Witness

      Statement that I did not believe I would have said this in my report if it

      had not been requested. I also referred to paragraph 229 of the Court of

      Appeal's judgment in the Josephine Hamilton & Others v Post Office

      Limited case ([POL00113278], Exhibit B54 to my First Witness

      Statement) which said that ARQ data had been requested but that it was

      not clear if it was disclosed.


2.7   I said at paragraph 119 of my First Witness Statement, in connection with

      the account I gave of my role in preparing the prosecution case against


                                Page 3 of 14
                                                                                     WITNO8940200
                                                                                   WITNO8940200




            Mr Holmes, that I would have prepared the committal bundle. It occurs to

            me that the committal bundle would have had to have included a form

            "CS012 List of Exhibits", which records the details of the disclosure

            made. I am unable to recall if the bundle did indeed contain this form,

            and I don't recall seeing it among the documents disclosed to me. What

            I have seen are the two schedules of sensitive and non-sensitive unused

            material (at [POL00051526] and [POL00051527], Exhibits B8 and B9 to

            my First Witness Statement).


      2.8   Lastly, at paragraph 117 of my First Witness Statement, I provided an

            explanation of my role as the disclosure officer in the prosecution of Mr

            Holmes. I said that my role would have been to ensure all appropriate

            material, used and unused, was disclosed to the prosecution and

             defence. On re-reading and reflecting on that part of my statement again,

            I believe that a more accurate account of the role of a disclosure officer

            in England is that it entailed ensuring that all appropriate material, used

            and unused, was disclosed to the Post Office Ltd ("POL") Criminal Law

             team, who would then disclose it to the defence. The position is different

            in Scotland, where "productions" (evidence) are submitted to COPFS,

             the prosecution authority in Scotland, who is then responsible for

             disclosure to the defence.


Training, instructions and guidance to investigators within the Security team


3.   Turning to the matters I am asked to consider in the Second Request, paragraph

     1 of the Second Request draws my attention to the Investigation Communication

     from Chris Card dated 1 November 2010 at [POL00169171], the attachment at


                                     Page 4 of 14
                                                                                        WITNO8940200
                                                                                      WITNO8940200




     [POL00169172] and the Procedures and Standards document "Recovery of

     Property Obtained Dishonestly. Compensation, Costs & Final Disposal of Case

     Exhibits" at [POL00104846], and I am asked to give an account of the context

     surrounding the issue identified in [P0L00104846], of any discussions I was a

     party to, and why the document placed emphasis on the recovery by Royal Mail

     Group Ltd on "the recovery of criminal assets and Business losses".


4.   I don't recall the email or the attachment, but note that I was a recipient of the

     email. I do recall that in 2010 POL was part of the Royal Mail Group, and we

     would receive updates to changes in their procedures and standards. I note that

     section 7 of the document relates to the seizure of property under Scottish Law.

     I don't recall being involved in a case in Scotland where property was seized.


5.   Paragraph 2 of the Second Request draws my attention to Investigation Circular

     sent by Chris Card on 8.3.11 (email at [POL00167250] and attachment at

     [POL00167251]) and I am asked to provide an account of the changes in

     interviewing practice in Scotland which were addressed in this communication.

     Again, I don't recall the email or the attachment, but note that I was a recipient of

     the email. On reading the circular, I note that it refers to the changes in

     interviewing practice which I described at paragraph 138 of my First Witness

     Statement (where I said that "Another difference was that prior to 2010, a suspect

     didn't have a right to a solicitor. This changed in 2010 with the Supreme Court

     decision in Cadder v HM Advocate. From 2010, anyone being interviewed under

     caution had to be offered a solicitor to be present").

Security team communications about the Horizon system


6.    Paragraph 4 of the Second Request draws my attention to an email from Mark


                                      Page 5 of 14
                                                                                         WITNO8940200
                                                                                       WITNO8940200




      Dinsdale dated 12.3.10 at [POL00172808] and the report attached (at document

      [POL00172809]) and I am asked how regularly these reports were sent to the

      Security Team, when they were introduced, the issues they covered, and the

      extent to which the reports provided information to investigators about technical

      issues relating to the Horizon system. Having considered the documents, I can

      recall these being sent and I believe they were sent every four weeks to the

      POL Security Team. I can't recall when they were introduced, but they generally

      covered the topics included within the document at [POL00172809] (for

      example, weekly incidents, updates of arrests, sentencing on branch attacks,

      prosecutions and programme update). I have considered the fifth bullet point

      under the heading "Security programmes for products" (on page 3). I don't recall

      receiving this particular report which contained this item on Horizon Online, but

      I accept I would have received it since I am on the distribution list of the email

      which enclosed this report.

Prosecution of William Quarm


7.   Paragraph 9 of the Second Request asks me to provide a full account of my

     involvement in and my recollection of the criminal prosecution of William Quarm,

     and I am asked to consider the documents referred to in paragraph 10. The

     account I have given here of my involvement in, and recollection of, this case is

     informed by the documents which I have reviewed.


8.   Paragraph 11 of the Second Request asks me how and when I first become

     involved in this case. I recall that I was initially involved as the second officer in

     the case, and that Raymond Grant, who was an Investigator/Fraud Advisor at the

     time, was the lead officer. In 2008, when this investigation commenced, I recall

     that there were only two investigators in Scotland, Raymond Grant and myself.

                                       Page 6 of 14
                                                                                          WITN08940200
                                                                                        WITNO8940200




     With the case being assigned to Raymond Grant, I would have been called on to

     act the second officer. I can't remember the exact date I became involved. At

     some point in 2009, I believe, Raymond Grant left POL and the case file was

     transferred to me. I can't remember at exactly which stage of the investigation

     this happened.


9.   Paragraph 12 of the Second Request asks me if I was aware of any allegations

     made relating to the reliability of the Horizon IT system and, if so, what I thought

     the significance of this was. I don't recall being made aware of any allegations

     made during the investigation of this case relating to the reliability of the Horizon

     system.


10. Paragraph 13 of the Second Request asks me about my role in relation to the

     audit of the Paible branch undertaken on 23.7.08. Having considered the

     document at document at [POL00166616] (the audit report dated 23.7.08), I am

     satisfied that I took no part in the audit or the decision to conduct the audit. Having

     also considered the documents at [POL00166618] (email chain, dated 8 July

     2008) and [POL00166619] (email chains dated 8.7.08 and 14.7.08), I note that

     there were communications between the Outlet Intervention Team, the Network

     Support Manager, Cash Management and the Compliance Team regarding

     excess cash at Paible PO. I therefore assume the decision to conduct the audit

     came about as a result of these exchanges.


11. Paragraph 14 of the Second Request asks me whose decision it was to interview

     Mr Quarm. I don't recall playing any role in the decision. I have reviewed the letter

     that Mr Quarm sent to Brian Trotter, Contract Advisor, dated 28.7.08 (at

     [POL00166620]) and I suspect this was the catalyst for the interview.


                                       Page 7 of 14
                                                                                      WITN08940200
                                                                                    WITNO8940200




12. Paragraph 15 of the Second Request asks me whose decision it was to suspend

     Mr Quarm. I have reviewed the document at [POL00166788] (an email Brian

     Trotter sent to Andy Bayfield on 23.7.08) and it appears to me from what he says

     that Brian Trotter made the decision to precautionarily suspend Mr Quarm.


13. Paragraph 16 of the Second Request asks me what investigations were made

     into Mr Quarm's finances. Having considered the record of the interview which

     took place on 8.8.08 (the documents at [POL00166599] and [POL00166600]), I

     note that I obtained some financial details from Mr Quarm in order to complete

     the   Financial   Evaluation   form.   Having   considered    the   document     at

     [POL00166621] (a letter Mr Quarm sent to Raymond Grant dated 12.8.08), I can

     see that Mr Quarm sent bank statements to Raymond Grant, together with a copy

     of his wife's P60. I don't recall any further investigations Raymond Grant made

     into Mr Grant's finances.


14. Paragraph 17 of the Second Request asks me to explain what further sources of

     information I considered during the investigation. Decisions about what further

     sources of information would be required in an investigation would have been for

     the lead investigator to take. I cannot recall if any further investigations were

     required when the case transferred to me.


15. Paragraph 18 of the Second Request asks if any Horizon data (and in particular

     ARQ logs) were requested from Fujitsu in this case. I don't recall that any Horizon

     data or ARQ logs were requested.


16. Paragraph 19 of the Second Request asks if legal advice was obtained at any

     stage of the investigation. I am not aware of Raymond Grant obtaining any legal

     advice at any stage of the investigation. I personally do not recall obtaining any


                                      Page 8 of 14
                                                                                     WITNO8940200
                                                                                   WITNO8940200




     legal advice at any stage of the investigation when the case was transferred to

     me. The only recollection I have about obtaining any legal advice was prompted

     by my review of the documents I describe at paragraph 21, but that related to the

     recovery of money after Mr Quarm's prosecution.


17. Paragraph 20 of the Second Request asks what role, if any, I played in the

     decision to prosecute. I had no role in the decision to prosecute. The decision to

     prosecute in Scotland is made by the COPFS.


18. Paragraph 21 of the Second Request asks me who was the disclosure officer in

     this case and paragraph 22 asks me to explain my role in relation to disclosure.

     Having considered the documents at [POL00166755] (the letter from COPFS to

     Raymond Grant dated 1.7.09 asking him to lodge the productions for the case)

     and [POL00166753] (the list of productions sent to the COPFS on 11.8.09) 1 can

     see that I submitted the productions to the COPFS. As I have stated previously,

     the position in Scotland is that the COPFS discloses the productions to the

     defence.


19. Paragraph 23 of the Second Request asks me what role I played in preparing for

     the prosecution. Other than what I have said above in relation to submitting the

     productions, I cannot recall any other role I played in preparing for the

     prosecution. In considering my response to this question I have looked at the

     Court Bundle (the document at [COPF0000001]), which has the details of the

     charge against Mr Quarm on page 1. It occurred to me that I may I have submitted

     the report to the COFPS (via the Specialist Reporting Agency ("SRA") website)

     which meant the charge was formulated in that way. The wording of the charge

     is similar to the wording used when you submit a charge via the SRA website.

                                                                                  WITNO8940200




     But I cannot recall with certainty if this is something I did.


20. Paragraph 24 of the Second Request asks me to describe the disclosure requests

     made by the defence and how these were responded to. I don't recall any

     disclosure requests made by the defence.


21. Paragraph 25 of the Second Request asks me what criminal enforcement

     proceedings were taken and my involvement in these proceedings. Having

     considered the documents at [POL00166727], [POL00166728], [POL00166729],

     [POL00166730], [POL00166731], [POL00166732] and [POL00166733] (the

     various letters from French Duncan and other documents regarding the trust

     deeds in relation to Mr Quarm) I can see Mr Quarm's assets were placed in trust.

     I have also considered the documents at [POL00166833], [POL00166840] and

     [POL00166842] (email correspondence that I had with Mandy Talbot, from the

     Dispute Resolution Team in POL Legal Services, and Zoe Topham, from the

     Former Agents Debt team, in May and October 2010). I can see from these email

     exchanges that we discussed the recovery of money from Mr Quarm. I don't recall

     having exchanged these emails or, indeed, why there was a discussion about

     recovery since it was known Mr Quarm had been sequestrated in 2008.


22. Paragraph 26 of the Second Request asks me to describe any further

     involvement I had in this case. Having considered the document at

     [POL00166683], I can see that that I obtained the witness statement that Doug

     Head, the Field Advisor/Auditor, gave detailing the outcome of the audit on

     23.7.08 (the box at the end of the statement advises that I "noted" the statement

     on 16.3.09). Having considered the document at [POL00166754] (the letter I

     received from COPES on 26.7.10), I can see that the productions in the case

    were returned to me. I believe I would have included these in the case file and

    sent it to the casework team when the case was closed. Having also considered

    the document at [POL00166843], I can also see that I completed and sent the

    case closure report. These matters aside, what involvement I can recall having in

    this case, prompted by my reviewing the documents that have been disclosed to

    me, is as I have already described.


23. Lastly, paragraph 27 of the Second Request asks me what my reflections are

    now on the way the investigation and prosecution was conducted by POL and

    the outcome of the case.


24. Firstly, I have considered the document at [SCTS00000070], the minute dated

    22.9.09 in which Mr Quarm raises points about the fairness of the interviews

    which took place on 7.8.09. I do not recall having received this minute, and was

    unaware that Mr Quarm had made this challenge. The minute states that Mr

    Quarm was denied the right to legal representation during the interviews, and

    goes on to say argue that this was contrary to Mr Quarm's rights under Article 6

    of the European Convention on Human Rights. As I mentioned at paragraph 5,

    above, and in my First Witness Statement, the Supreme Court decision in Cadder

     v HM Advocate was made in 2010, with the result that anyone being interviewed

    under caution had to be offered a solicitor to be present. Mr Quarm's interviews

    were conducted in August 2008, so my belief is that the interviews would have

    been carried out in accordance with POL's policy and practice as it existed at that

    time.


25. Having reviewed the Case Closure Reporting form [POL00166843] and other

    documents, I am reminded that Mr Quarm had initially pleaded not guilty to


                                    Page 11 of 14

                                                                                    WITNO8940200




     embezzlement of £40,277.76, but ultimately offered a guilty plea relating to a

     lesser sum of £27,000 and he was convicted at the Lochmaddy Sheriff Court on

     29.6.10.


26. I have also reviewed the document at [SCTS00000112], an affidavit made by Mrs

     Anne Quarm on 7.9.23 in the matter of an appeal against Mr Quarm's conviction.

     I have considered what she has said about Mr Quarm never having admitted to

     taking money and the reference she has made to POL's evidence being "faulty".

     In preparing this statement I have also been made aware of reports in the media

     about the appeal and a statement made by the Scottish Criminal Cases Review

     Commission, and I understand that the appeal for Mr Quarm has been

     successful. I do not feel able to comment in any detail or offer any reflections on

     the handling of the case based on the limited information I have available to me

     at the moment.
