REPORT Doe. Type : Reference

Date : 29/10/99

1. Introduction

This report is agreed jointly, between POCL and ICL Pathway and provides a high level quantitative overview of implementation
activities, deployed within the Infrastructure and Installation Phases, to facilitate the introduction of the Horizon system into the
POCL network.

The figures within this report are based purely on National Rollout and do not include Live Trial Outlets except figures quoted for
Checking Rollout Data. Where cumulative figures are quoted these represent activity from the Start of National Rollout.

A Dual Traffic Light Measurement System is encompassed within this report, which is intended to create a high level management
summary. These measurements will be categorised into an overall End to End Implementation Programme Rollout status as well
as a status for the individual activities within both the infrastructure and installation phases. An additional system will operate in
order to provide Trend Analysis. See Appendix A for Success Criteria measurements for individual activities.

The reporting method for RFI has been further developed in order
to more accurately reflect the number of outlets that have reached
this stage. The accumulative number of RFI offices now represents
the cumulative number of preparations complete, minus any
outstanding modification or preparation snagging issues. The
current totals for outstanding snagging issues at outlets are 346 for
modifications & 295 for preparations. This month 940 offices had
preparations, from these 903 became RFI. This brings the new
cumulative to 8638 offices.

Training continues to cause major difficulties. A variety of different issues have been
encountered including, outlets not contacted to book training, outlets turning up to non-
existent courses, outlet staff being booked onto wrong course type. This is compounded by the
fact that the daily & weekly reports are not received at the scheduled times, This is further
compounded by the reports being inaccurate. KPL have also been unable to respond to issue
raised by the TLM in a timely fashion, or occasionally at all.

Major issues have been experienced around training. These have arisen as either staff not
been invited to training events or only just before the training is due. Also faults on the
‘Training reports and lack of resource in KPL to deal with issues has resulted in considerable
pressure on the regional teams. These problems have resulted in last minute cancellation of
installations. Although most issues have been contained to enable offices to proceed in the
programme, this cannot be maintained at full beat rate next year.
‘There is still a significant number of modification and preparation snags outstanding, some Maod’s & Prep’s
dating back to January this year. Each snag is being pursued with the suppliers in order of
priority depending on when the offices are due for installations. The backlog of issues is
adding pressure to the rollout helpdesk as POCL chase up calls where there has been no
