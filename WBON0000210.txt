Jonny,

As per my text, it would be helpful to have a call to clarify what you are looking for in relation to Steve’s
statement, paras 29 and 30.

He and his team have confirmed what I said in emails below, that using revised search criteria has resulted in
more than 14 instances now being identified.

The interim results of that revised search were included further down this chain, including the note that to
complete the search will take further work:

0.5 Day to identify KELs which refer to Riposte insert functions that were used by the SSC to correct issues.

2.5 Days to search each matching KEL against Peak and then check each Peak to see if the KEL solution was
applied.

Please would you confirm if you want that work to proceed so that a revised figure might be established
with as much accuracy as the circumstances might allow.

Steve has also confirmed to me this afternoon that the statement at paragraph 30 wasn’t intended to convey
that the 14 occasions referred to were all during the period of Roll’s employment, as some are clearly after
he left.

We confirm that one of the Peaks was returned twice in the original search, so that the figure should in any
case have been 13.

We confirm that the Peaks listed in the footnote do not between them provide examples of all of the six
circumstances noted in 29.1 to 29.6, and additional Peaks were then cited to provide some of the examples.

Thanks

Also, there is a duplicate in the 14 Peaks referred to in your statement — presumably that means we are talking about
13 occasions on which data was injected into the counter and not 13.

Jonny,

Steve and his team would have to provide the answer to your question, I don’t think I can do so, but the
evidence behind this part of the statement doesn’t seem clear.

I think that in following up your request of 01-Mar-2019 for a similar search to be carried out “to establish (1)
how many times data was injected into the computer server/data centre while Roll was employed by Fujitsu; and (2)
how many of those incidents involved transaction data?” the results have suggested that the number of times data
may have been injected at the counter is greater than 14, and that is as a result of different search criteria
being used. Steve and his colleagues would need to comment on that.

Perhaps paragraph 30 was not intended to state that data was injected on 14 occasions during the time that
Roll was employed, given that some of the Peaks listed in the footnote are recognisably not from the time of
Roll just by their numbers (e.g. those above PC02... cannot be before 2010), but the context given by
following on from para 29 appears to suggest it.

WBD_000080.000003
WBONO0000210
WBON0000210

However, it has already been stated in the email below that the 14 Peaks listed in the statement do not
between them provide examples of each of the six circumstances noted in 29.1 to 29.6, and additional Peaks
were then cited to provide some of the examples.

Matthew,
We need to get to the bottom of this ASAP, before the trial begins on Monday morning.

Steve's second statement explains that:

“At my request, my colleague John Simpkins (Senior Consultant), carried out a search of the incident management
system for incidents which required injecting data into the counter, using any one of the following search terms:
“RiposteMessageFile", "RiposteMessage", "LPO Delete", "Marooned", "RiposteObject put". From the results I can
determine that this was only carried out in the following circumstances...".

Does this explain why Steve only refers to 14 Peaks? Were the others not caught by the search?

From talking to SSC, it seems that this section of Steve’s WS may not be correct, in terms of there being
many more than 14 instances. As examples of the six types, I have added in Peak references in your email
below, those in red are not included in the list of 14 Peaks and so are examples of further instances. It is
estimated that some days more work may be required to establish a more detailed account. I believe this has
come to light from the analysis carried out in response to the question you were chasing this morning, from

your email of the 18t March at 13:37.
I have pasted in the response from SSC below:
I believe that there are MANY more Peaks that updated objects which only mention the associated KEL.

This will require further investigation of all KELs that may have required such actions then inspect each Peak that
mentions that KEL to see if it was used.

Thanks Matthew. I don't quite follow the response to the third bullet. In Steve's second statement he states that data

The 14 Peaks are said to evidence this, i.e. there should be at least one Peak for each one of the above
circumstances. Is that not the case?

Matthew,

Just a few further questions:-

we understand that OCRs were used minor support changes that did not required the full approval process that was
needed for OCPs — did OCRs still require Post Office consent?[Lenton, Matthew] No

if a Peak does not refer to an OCP/OCR, does this mean that there was not an OCP/OCR in relation to an incident?
[Lenton, Matthew] Ideally yes, however we cannot be certain as it is a manual action to add or type the
reference, so an OCR/OCP could still have been raised but the reference not added to the Peak.

of the 14 Peaks referred to below, can you tell me which relate to:-

o fixing a Riposte Index at the counter;[Lenton, Matthew] 1 with supplemental fix as below
(PC0060114)

© removing a historic message that was influencing the balancing process on a replaced counter;
and[Lenton, Matthew] None

© removing redundant configuration items.[Lenton, Matthew] 11
(I think one of PC 0060114, 01760799 and 0203896 relates to each of the above).
[Lenton, Matthew] The other type is:
PC0060114: Correction Message insertion. PM aware. No OCR/OCP mentioned

PC0175821: Correction Message insertion. PM aware. OCP21918 & OCR 21847

Thank you in advance.

That's great, thank you. Given that some of the end dates are 2010, are we happy that they all relate to Legacy
Horizon?

Also, in para 28.4 Steve says that he can see from PC0175281 that the transaction insertion had the additional
property “Comment:PC0175821" inserted, but we can't see that anywhere in the peak. Is it in one of the hyperlinks
and, if so, can you send me the document please?

I’ve added in the open and close dates of each of the Peaks in the email below; R Roll was employed 05-
Mar-2001 to 17-Sep-2004, therefore only the first Peak (highlighted) has any overlap with his period of
employment. From what I can understand of that Peak however, it looks like the actual change being
referred to was done on 11-Jan-2001, the rest of the call is about trying to obtain an events report, but in the
end it appears that they give up as the issue has been fixed.

Matthew,

An urgent question has arisen in relation to paragraph 30 of Steve's second statement. In that paragraph Steve states
that transactions were only injected into the counter "in the following circumstances while Mr Roll was employed by
Eujitsu (emphasis added):-

29.1 fixing a Riposte Index at the counter;

29.2 removing a historic message that was influencing the balancing process on a replaced counter;
29.3 correcting configuration data after a PinPad change;

29.4 removing redundant configuration items;

29.5 the example given above involving five corrupted bureau transactions; and

29.6 removing historic recovery information."

This is based on the content of row 6 in the table below, Steve's statement goes on to say that this only happened on
14 occasions and only one of those involved transaction data. The 14 occasions were:

0060114 {POL-0234909}, /Lenton, Matthew] 20-Dec-2000 - 28-Mar-2001
PC0112293 {POL-0283845}, /Lenton, Matthew] 09-Dec-2004 - 14-Dec-2004
PC0112293 {POL-0283845}, /Lenton, Matthew] Duplicate of above

PC0112397 {POL-0283948}, /Lenton, Matthew] 13-Dec-2004 - 13-Dec-2004
PC0112650 {POL-0284204}, /Lenton, Matthew] 17-Dec-2004 - 20-Dec-2004
PC0112659 {POL-0284213}, /Lenton, Matthew] 17-Dec-2004 - 20-Dec-2004
PC0118037 {POL-0289559},/Lenton, Matthew] 24-Mar-2005 - 24-Mar-2005
PC0122806 {POL-0293307}, /Lenton, Matthew] 05-Jul-2005 - 05-Jul-2005
PC0170799 {POL-0341013}, /Lenton, Matthew] 03-Dec-2008 - 05-Dec-2008
PC0175821 {POL-0345994}, /Lenton, Matthew] 19-Feb-2009 - 20-Mar-2009
PC0182141 {POL-0352240}, /Lenton, Matthew] 02-Jun-2009 - 04-Jun-2009
PC0198266 {POL-0368128}, /Lenton, Matthew] 28-Apr-2010 - 16-Jul-2010
PC0201613 {POL-0371420}, [Lenton, Matthew] 15-gu1-2010 - 29-Jul-2010

PC0203896 {POL-0373686}. [Lenton, Matthew] 03-Sep-2010 - 07-Sep-2010

It appears that the 14 occasions actually span the life of Legacy Horizon, rather than the period during which Roll was
employed. Is that right?

Please would you get back to me ASAP?

Because of the volume of data here (735 incidents) and the need to
eyeball each one we’re restricted the initial analysis to the 390 calls
opened between 1999 and Jan 2002 (inc.). After this the beat rate
significantly decreased (only 345 in the subsequent 8 years). This is
believed to be due to the version M1 rollout (summer 2001) which
appears to have significantly increased the reliability in this area.

This relates to configuration information (similar to LPO above) and

We searched the following databases to try and identify the incidents

Did: (1) Belfast team; and (2) privileged users have the ability to inj
transaction data between 2001 and 2004? Do they have that ability now?

Gareth Jenkins: With Horizon Online, there is the Transaction
Correction Tool which can inject transactions and this is controlled by
SSC. It is audited when it runs and we have only used it once in
March 2010. The DBAs in Belfast can in theory do anything to the
BRDB. In practice they will run scripts tested by dev as part of a
systems upgrade if DB changes are required. Any such access is
audited and since 2015 the actual commands run are also audited.

With old Horizon, control was weaker. SSC could inject into
Correspondence Servers and also at the counter.

Belfast team: Belfast had administrative access to the
correspondence servers and had a theoretical ability to inject data
into the messagestores, but don t believe that they had the technical
understanding to do so.

Belfast had no access to counters, UNIX/NT team having no users and
no knowledge of administrative user accounts/passwords.

They would not have injected any data unless it happened to be done
by scripts that they were asked to run and which were provided under

change control. Direct manipulation of the messagestore wasn t
something that they knew how to do and would not have attempted to
do lest it break the running applications which harvested/inserted
data. Their understanding of the actual messages was very low/non-

actions. We had auditability of the work done but no change control
entries. We assume that the reasoning behind this was to allow
implementation of support actions ASAP, and the audit trail being
good enough where there was no financial impact.
Therefore we are still looking at how / if we can provide an accurate
answer to this question for the earlier years.

Dear all,

Privileged & Confidential

Thank you for your time earlier. Here's a list of the actions that I captured from today's calls. Please let me know if
there's anything you'd like to add or change:-

\ActionI Paragraph I Action Assigned [Fujitsu

"laptop" and/or "luggable" and/or "outreach" etc.
[Matthew Lenton]
The Peaks referenced below Details of Peaks
provided at left.

PCO0100174 March Ist 2004 to Sth March
2004

FAD317309 reporting: Horizon Kit rebooting
itself for no apparent reason.

Helpdesk user: "Over the past 2-3 weeks
engineers have been to site and have replaced
2xBU's and 2xPSU's but the problem
persists."

BU = base units = PC itself. PSU = Power
supply units within the base units

RR "Evidence (from event logs) shows that
the power is being switched off every morning
shortly (ie 5 or 6 minutes) before the PM logs
ont

RR: "After carrying out tests on our rigs, I
have been able to duplicate the problem here
on ONE of our rigs but not on others. It
seems that the Screen Power Button is
incorrectly connected to the motherboard."

RR: "We have now identified two instances of
this, one in live. This is a hardware build
quality issue."

WBD_000080.000022
This was followed by:

PCO0100899 18th March 2004 to 24th March
2004.

Hardware returned from site to Bracknell for
examination,

RR: "Tests carried out on screen power
switch - working correctly, no further action
required."

Your questions 2d,e,f,g

d) Is his example true, or could it have been
true: Yes. Can find no data on the origin for the
statement: "This is a hardware build quality
issue". Could be a discussion with engineering
which was not recorded on the incident progress.
Information we have only describes the hardware
issue being seen internally to FJ on one instance
of test rig hardware. No hardware error proved
on the site.

If so, how often did that sort of problem occur:
Very rare. Only one other found using keywords
"standby", "laptop", "luggable". PCO0S5550 which
was a problem on prototype hardware going into
standby mode.

What would have caused it: Inconclusive. No
information on root cause of issue reported by
the Post Master onsite. Could be a hardware
problem, could be user miss-operation of
hardware.

Could it have affected/did it affect branch
accounts: No. Once powered on the unit would
function as normal.

If so, might its effect on branch accounts never
have been detected with the result that some
SPMs might have been wrongly held liable for
false deficits: No

e) Would Rolls have disassembled laptops and
done the other things he describes in para 8:
Have to assume he did as per the incident
updates. I expect he had some assistance
(especially with kit on test rigs - different team
totally) but unable to substantiate.

Would he have had/did he have the
conversation with his manager he describes in
para 8: Just can’t answer this. My analysis of the
issue would suggest that it turned out to be
unimportant because there was no proof that this
ever happened in the live estate and that his
comment of "This is a hardware build quality
issue" is simply conjecture. However, he may
have discussed with engineering and truly
discovered a batch of faulty hardware. I would

WBON0000210

WBON0000210

have expected an update in the incident reading
"Discussed with xxxxxxxx in engineering and we
determined that........ Bad batch...... etc" No such
updates are present.

f) Was the problem referred to in para kept
secret, as claimed at the end of para 8: No
evidence either way. I would not expect that to
be the case. It is not in Fujitsu's interest to have
faulty equipment that is not corrected damaging
reputation.

g) Would Fujitsu management have known/did it
know about this problem? Would/did Post
Office? If not, why not: No way of knowing.
Information no longer exists

Provide details of Fujitsu's document storage
practices and retention policies. Are emails, word
documents etc. from 2001 — 2004 available?

[Matthew Lenton] Emails cannot be retrieved
Srom the accounts of former Fujitsu
employees from that period, and back ups are
not held for that period of time. The only
records of such a person’s emails would be if.
they are part of a current employee’s email
account or pst archive, in which case it would
be only the subset of their emails that were to
or from the other user. Similarly, for other
documentation that was held locally be
individual employees on their laptops, that
would have been deleted when the user left.

As we have already seen, some limited
information from this period does exist, stored
in Dimensions and other networked
repositories, some of which we have already
provided in connection with this case.
