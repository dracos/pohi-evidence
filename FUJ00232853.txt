FUJITSU RESTRICTED - COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE

Customer Business Impact Forum (CBIF) Proposal

Back Office Printer Reference Pco290005

Job Cancelation

failure not reported

to user

Derek Carter Date 17/06/2022
Description

Currently the CBA ignores the failure of the operating system to cancel a back-office print job and

closes the print dialog with no indication to the user that the print job might remain on the print

queue.

This issue was raised by DEV via LST, and it is not clear (nor can we reasonably tell) whether or not
this has occurred in Live but is certainly possible.

The underlying issue (failure of the O/S to cancel the print job, as opposed to failure of the CBA to
notify the user) may lead to the back-office queue getting stuck.

The impact of this issue (failure of the CBA to notify the user) could acerbate the above, but
ultimately leaves the SPM unclear as to what’s happen and in a poorer position to decide how to
resolve the problem (e.g., by calling the HelpDesk).

The options to resolve the failure to notify the user amounts to a CBA change, options being

1. CBA to report the failure to the user such that they can report this issue and be given
guidance on what remedial actions can be taken

2. CBA to repeatedly attempt to cancel a print job for an agreed amount of time (whilst
displaying a “processing wait” message to the user) until either successful cancellation or
time-out. In the failure case, option (1) is then followed.

Recommendation
Option (2) with a “reasonable” time-out, e.g. 1 minute.

Implications / Considerations
It’s not clear if or how often this happens in the LIVE environment as currently not reported to the
user by CBA.
