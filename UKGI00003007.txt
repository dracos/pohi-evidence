Dear Minister,

I am writing to send you a note, attached, setting out the Post Office's detailed response to the allegations made by a
number of MPs in Parliament during the Westminster Hall debate on the Mediation Scheme in December. You may of
course wish to table this in Parliament. Subject to your view we will also publish this response on our website.

We have also written to the MPs who spoke in the debate inviting them to meet to discuss the cases and the points they
raised in the debate.

Best wishes
Mark
