summary: SVIC9 - Audit ~ The RFI file produce on closing an ARQ needs to include the new HNG-X functionality
Incident Description:

this defect was identified during a demo that was organised to enable Penny Thomas a view of the of the HNG-X Audit
functionality. The demo was on the SVéI test environment and used the 00.14.15.00 Release.

Following the demo the issues identified were discussed with the Audit Development team and a initial view was taken on whether
leach issue is a requirement for Release 1 or can be delayed to Release 2.

this defect was deemed to be a Release 1 requirement.

the RFI report needs to be enhanced to include the functionality that is new in HNG-X :~
h) Crypto Check
2) Use of Queries

[this may be achieveable by enhancing the QueryHandler log file and appending this to the RFI report.

Please route call to Audit Dev
