             Request


                   In paragraph 5 of the Defence, of the words "The Defendant avers that any apparent
                   shortfall is entirely the product of problems with the Horizon computer and accounting
                   system used by the Claimant" please state precisely:


                   1.1.       the full nature and extent of the problems that the Defendant alleges he
                              encountered with the Horizon system and on what occasions he encountered
                              them.


                   1.2       how and why each of the alleged problems with the Horizon, system meant that
                             'the losses in question were allegedly theoretical rather than real.


                   I. -3     Between cash weeks 42 and 49 whether the Defendant admits:


                             (a)        ordering approximately £305,000 cash from the Claimant (and if not,
                                        what sum the Defendant ordered over this period);


                             (b)        returning only approximately £20,000 of that cash to the Claimant (and if
        I'                              not, how much was returned);

                                  (c)    that the Marine Drive branch never ran out of cash (i.e. it always had
                                         sufficient cash to service its transactions).


            Reply


                     1.1          The problems that the Defendant encountered with the Horizon system and the
                                  occasions on which he encountered them were as follows:


                                  i)     Not communicating properly. The                  system, as installed at the




                                                                                Horizon
                                         Marine Drive branch, included 2 computer terminals with touch




                                                                                                             screens
                                         and keyboards, together with bespoke software developed and
                                         maintained on behalf of the Claimant by Horizon Systems. One of the
                                         terminals was known as the base unit, which the Defendant believes had
                                         a small amount of internal memory, and had an JSDN, (subsequently
                                         broadband), connection off-site to a central monitoring and/or data
                                         storage and/or controlling station, which was maintained on behalf of the
                                         Claimant by Fujitsu Services. The other terminal was known as node
                                         unit, which the Defendant believes had no separate internal memory, was
                                         connected to the base unit and communicated to it such data as might be
                                         input to it. The Defendant believes that periodically, several times
                                         throughout a day's trading, the base unit would then transmit data input
                                         both to it and through the node unit, onwards to the central station. On
                                         occasions too numerous to recall during the period in question, the
                                        Defendant told the Claimant that he considered that the 2 units were not
                                        communicating with each other properly.


                                 ii)    Screen freezing. The display of one or other or both of the terminals
                                        would `freeze', i.e. lock up and fail to respond, either to commands
                                        attempted to be entered through the terminal's keyboard or commands
                                        attempted to be entered by hand through the touch screen function of the
                                        terminal's display, requiring the system to be re-booted. This problem
                                        was a regular occurrence and happened approximately weekly during the
                                        period in question.


                                                                 2

                            iii)   Blank screen. The display of one or other or both of the terminals would
                                   suddenly go blank before returning to the sales screen. This problem
                                   occurred approximately monthly during the period         question.




                                                                                       in
                            iv)    Card swipe nor reading. The electronic card swipe of one or other or
                                   both of the terminals, used to read a customer's payment card, would fail
                                   to read the card properly. This problem was a very regular




                                                                                                    occurrence
                                   and happened approximately daily during the period in question.


                            v)     Rolling over cash figures. The Defendant believes that the Horizon
                                   system 'rolled over' cash figures in the weekly cashflow figure (a report
                                   that can be produced, also known by the Claimant, as On Hand Cash
                                   Handling, or ONCH) giving a figure that was 4-5 times as big as the
                                   actual cash declaration for that day. The Defendant first became aware
                                   that this information was available to be printed out during cash week 48,
                                   the week ending 25 February 2004, when it was printed out by one of the
                                   Claimant's business support workers (although he subsequently became
                                   aware that his assistant, Christine Train, had been aware of it since in or
                                   around week 43, and had periodically run off cashflow reports). The
                                   Defendant looked at this figure several times each week from that time
                                   onwards until his suspension by the Claimant on 23 March 2004. On
                                   average, the figure given by the system was incorrect on at least one
                                   occasion each week (although previously, prior to the Defendant being
                                   aware of the facility to print the figures, Ms Train had noted that the
                                   figure was incorrect more frequently, often several times each week).


                                   Lost transactions. The Horizon system would `lose', i.e. fail to record,
                      vi)




                                   transactions which the Defendant knew he had entered onto the system.
                                   By way of example only, a cheque which the Defendant knew he had
                                   entered into the system as being a cheque, would not appear identified as
                                   a cheque, This problem would occur at least weekly during the period in
                                   question, sometimes as frequently as twice a day but then not for about 4
                                   days.

                   1,2      How and why each of the problems experienced by the Defendant with the
                            Horizon system means that the alleged losses in question were theoretical rather
                            than real, is an issue that will require disclosure from the Claimant for the period
                            in question, in particular as to the correct operation of the Horizon Systems'
                            software; (including any modifications or upgrades), and the correct operation of
                            the hardware maintained by Fujitsu Services, (including any replacement
                            equipment), together with expert evidence, both in the field of Information
                            Technology and Accountancy. Without prejudice thereto the Defendant replies as
                            follows:


                           'i)         If the Horizon system missed a transactional piece of information it
                                       would alter the balance recorded on it. If it failed to record a payment
                                       out, there would be less actual cash at the branch than the amount of cash
                                       recorded on the system. As more cash tends to go out from a Sub Post
                                       Office than comes in, such a discrepancy would tend to operate so that
                                       the balance showing in the system was greater than the actual balance
                                       held at the branch.

                                       to send with a bundle of cheques to be sent away, the report will not
                                       correspond to the number of cheques present and it is necessary to re-
                                       input, manually, the additional cheque, so the report matches. However,
                                       a further amount may have been added to the balance recorded centrally
                                       by the amount of the lost cheque, although possibly as cash. Thus the
                                       Sub Post Office appears to have more money than it does.

                           is to give a picture of what the Horizon system believes to be the level of cash

                          current balance period but it is not a real time picture. (cf the Claimant's Horizon
                           System User. Guide Navigation Booklet — Ref. HSUG 14/1 — at page 17 'l ine 8) It
                           is not possible to be sure when it is printed that everything is up to date. The data
                          that comprises a balance snapshot is held off site. A request for a balance

                           the Sub Post Office and it is not possible to check whether it has gone or not, so
                           the balance snapshot may not be fully up to date. It will also be subject to any
                           errors that have occurred in the operation of the system (as to which see the
                           Defendant's answer to request 2.2 below). The Defendant's belief is based on
                           speaking to Post Office staff such as Ms Oglesby, engineers, Horizon Systems
                           helpdesk staff, Network Business Support Centre staff and the Horizon system

                           If all of these aspects have been performed correctly, a balance snapshot should
                           show a balance of what cash a branch should have but often it does not. A
                           balance snapshot will                 show individual transactions successfully entered onto




                                                   also

                     2.3   The Defendant maintains that a balance snapshot is able to and should show the
                           actual transfer of cash from the cash account into the suspense account to the
                           extent that it wilt show the transactional aspect of that transfer and how it affects
                            the rest of the balancing procedure. It is a notional transfer and it is recorded on a
                           ,balance snapshot as a payment. However, it is necessary to be able to interpret
                           the infotmation recorded  a balance snapshot to understand that it is a transfer
                                                            on

                     2,4    How and why a balance snapshot is capable of demonstrating that the alleged

                           matter for expert evidence in the field of Accountancy. Without prejudice
                           thereto, the Defendant believes that by comparing the actual balance snapshots
                           which he took daily after the close of each day's trading over the period in
                           question, with the final balance produced by the Horizon system at the end of
                           each week's trading, the daily cash declarations, and final weekly cash
                           declaration, (both compiled manually), it should be possible to demonstrate that
                           the alleged shortfalls were only accounting errors rather than genuine shortfalls.
                           ,The daily balance snapshots should (but may not, for the reasons set out in reply
                            2.2 above) equal the daily cash declared. The daily balance snapshots should (but
                           may not, for the reasons set out in reply 2.2 above) produce the final weekly
                           balance (transactionally). The daily cash declarations should produce the final
                           weekly cash declaration. A comparison between all 4 sources of data should be
                           able to show where error has arisen.

           Request

                                                                                                 Defendant's
           3,      In paragraph 9 of the Part 20 Claim of the words "wrongfully terminated the
                   Contract as a Sub-Postmaster following his suspension " please state:


                   3.1    how allegedly was the Claimant at fault in wrongfully terminating the
                          Defendant's Contract as Sub-Postmaster. In other words please identify whether
                          ,the Defendant relies upon an alleged procedural irregularity or wrongful
                           ground(s) for termination or both and in what respect?


                   3.2     how allegedly should the Claimant have dealt with the shortfall that forms the
                           basis of the claim given the right to determine the Defendant's Contract on 3
                           months notice without cause?


                   3.3     how allegedly should the process of termination have taken place that did not
                           otherwise take place?




                   3.1     The Defendant relies upon both procedural irregularity and/or wrongful grounds
                           for termination in the following respects:


                           Procedural Irregularities:
                           i)      The Claimant held meetings that lead to the Defendant's suspension and
                                   termination without having first called in one of its investigation teams.
                                   The Defendant believes that it was the Claimant's practice to call in such
                                   a team within a period of 3 weeks. The Defendant had been asking the
                                   Claimant to call in an investigation team since the discrepancies between
                                   the Horizon system and the actual cash position had first come to light, a
                                   period of approximately 12 weeks by the time of his suspension, but the
                                   Claimant failed to do so. Likewise, the Defendant asked for the Police to
                                   become involved but the Claimant declined to involve them.

                       ii)     Information that the Defendant had requested prior to the meeting that
                               lead to his termination, as set out in his letter dated 28 April 2004 was
                               not provided to him.


                       iii)    The Claimant would not allow tape recording, either of the meeting that
                               lead to his termination or of the appeal hearing against his termination.


                       iv)     The Claimant's notes of the meetings are not accurate,


                       v)      There had been no on site investigation of the Defendant's complaints by
                               either Horizon Systems or Fujitsu Services.


                        v)     The Claimant had not checked the events on the software system before
                               l March 2004, when the apparent discrepancies experienced by the
                               Defendant had started to occur in cash week 42, the week ending 14
                               January 2004.


                       • v)    The note taker in the appeal, Miss Paula Carmichael, had previously
                               been involved in the matter as she was the Personal Assistant to Mr
                               David Mellows-Facer, the Claimant's I•Iead of Area, with whom the
                               Defendant had been speaking and corresponding. The Defendant had
                               also previously discussed the situation with Miss Carmichael when Mr
                               Mellows-Facer would not return his calls.


                       vi)     At or following both the termination and the appeal meetings, the
                               Defendant was given no opportunity to address what issues would be put
                               by Ms Oglesby or Ma Jones to others, namely Elizabeth Morgan and Mr
                               Davlynn Cumberland and Ms Anita Turner for their consideration., nor,
                               subsequently, to address the conclusions reached by them.

                       i)      The Defendant did not have several large unexplained losses, whether
                               totalling £25,758.75 or at all, although there was an apparent. discrepancy

                      actual cash held by the Defendant at the Marine Drive branch.


              ii)     The Defendant was not unable to make the losses good as alleged as
                      there were no such `losses' to be made good'


                      Had such alleged losses in fact existed, the Defendant would not have
                      been unable to make them good but wished to be satisfied that they did
                      so exist.




                      The Defendant slid not fail to manage the Marine Drive branch or
                      perform his work properly satisfactorily. No dissatisfaction had
                      previously been expressed by the Claimant with the Defendant's
                      management of the Marine Drive branch or his performance of his work,
                      whether by way of formal or informal, written or verbal warning.

              forms the basis of its claim, given its alleged right to determine the Defendant's
              Contract on. 3 months notice without cause is a matter within the Claimant's own
              knowledge and in any event it is not a matter that is presently in dispute in these
              proceedings. Accordingly, this is not a request coming within CPR Part 18,1(1)
