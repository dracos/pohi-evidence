Hi Paula

lam not around next week but everything is covered. David has my in box and will come with Chris to the catch up with

you.

I have spoken to Tony who is packing up his house in the US ready to come home this weekend. If the press contact him
he will just say that the document is confidential and won't comment.

I hope you have a good week.

Best wishes
Belinda

Thank you Mark. Unhelpful but sadly not surprising.

You are suggesting exactly the right approach and I'm sure the heads-up is appreciated by all of us. (Btw just worth
asking Roger/Michael to remind their regional/areas managers of media policy - ie., no contact.)

Belinda/Chris, we have our regular catch up next week, so we can pick up on overall status. (I think by then you will have
had chance to catch up with Tony Hooper.)

Regards, Paula

Hi all

Further to Chris' update last week about Second Sight's "Part Two" report, we have today been
approached by a BBC North reporter who has clearly seen a copy of the Report and Post Office's
subsequent letter to applicants. As Chris explained last week, we are well prepared for this eventuality.

I understand that BBC North plan to run a story on Monday about the Report. We have a short but firm
line on which we will hold. This will state that leak is highly regrettable and not in interests of
applicants, and confirm our position is that the report is inaccurate.

We will not comment further and it is essential we hold on that position to avoid giving the story

unnecessary oxygen. We will work hard to keep a lid on it, though clearly other outlets, including those
who have previously reported on the issue, may follow up on anything run by BBC North.

We are informing the Working Group as a matter of courtesy and making it clear that Post Office will not
be drawn into commenting on matters which are confidential to the Scheme.

I will monitor the situation closely and update you if the position changes.
Best wishes,

Mark
