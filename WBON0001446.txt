All - please see attached the PO plan of action.

There are several actions for us over the weekend:

1.2 — David C please can you take this one and send me an email with your thoughts (caveated as necessary given
the speed of the advice).

1.3 — Dave P, please keep doing your note on the recoverability of loss bits of the judgment. I'll do the wider analysis
on all other issues.

1.4 - Amy please can you answer this questions and email it to me.

1.5 — Me (and then I'll pass this to Rachel).

This work essentially sets the legal foundation for what PO needs to do next so they need it asap.

Thanks all

Dear all

Further to the exchange of emails todays on the Common Issues Trial Judgment, please find attached an
initial actions list which I think captures what everyone has fed in and is purposely simple. Further actions
and work will be required as advice is received from the lawyers but hopefully this will get the ball rolling.
Please do send me anything that I have missed.

There are a number of deliverables required before Monday, but necessarily so as they provide the
springboard for everything else (next steps, reporting, briefing papers etc). I will set up a meeting for first
thing on Monday (with dial ins for those not in FD) so that we can assess where we are, based upon the
advice which will be provided over the weekend.

Jane: can we please use the Chairman’s Office as a ‘base’?

Jane & Al: would you like David Cavender QC to come to GE on Monday / the Board call on Tuesday?
What are the timings of these meetings please?

Andy / Rachel: Can you please get the relevant instructions out to One Essex / your team. Please give me a
call to discuss anything in the attached table which isn’t clear.

Thanks all

Mark
