Dear Colin
Re: CCN 889, Notification of closure of POL HAPS system

“an essential part of everyday life” www.postoffice.co.uk

As Nick Samuel informed you at the Joint Change Control Board meeting on
5 December 2001, Post Office Limited takes the view that no charge should
be made for this CCN, since it merely sets the date for an event that is
already included in the Contractors obligations pursuant to clause 201.6 (b) of
the Codified Agreement, and hence is covered by the Operating payments.
The paragraphs below provide our reasons for taking this view.

Clause 201.6 (b) refers to CSR+ which is defined in Schedule A01 by
reference to the CCD, “ICL Pathway Core System Release Plus Contents
Description” (the CSR+ RCD).

The CSR+ RCD defines the services that are included in CSR+ by cross-
reference to the CCD, “Service Architecture Design Document” (the SADD),
showing which services described in the SADD are included, excluded or
partly included in CSR+, and where partly included the extent of compliance.

The relevant sections of the SADD are

4-1.2.2.1 APS architecture overview

The processing and data flow for APS are based on transactions
occurring at post office counters, the results of these transactions
being recorded in the local journal and then transmitted back to the
relevant AP Client via TMS and the APS Host system. In the near
term the POCL HAPS system takes the place of Clients.
Progressively Client flows will cut across from HAPS to Clients.

4.1.2.10.2 Migration For Existing AP Clients

Direct links to AP Clients will be provided as part of the Steady State
Service. However, Pathway anticipates that there will be a phased

introduction of such links, with each connection requiring a specific
migration plan.

The interfaces required to enable direct links to an AP Client are
documented in the Client-specific AP Client Specification. The
infrastructure necessary to enable AP Client Migration is described in
AP Client Migration Strategy.

The table in section 2.0 of the CSR+ RCD shows paragraph 4.1.2.10.2 as
being included in CSR and CSR+, and paragraph 4.1.2.2.1 as being included
in CSR+.

So the AP Client Migration Strategy CCD (the Migration Strategy) is included
in the definition of CSR+ by reference from section 4.1.2.10.2 of the SADD
which in turn is included by reference from section 2.0 of the CSR+ RCD.
Section 7 of the Migration Strategy lists the activities to be carried out,
including the following:

7.7.4 Post-Migration Activities

¢ Confirm that HAPS interfaces can be closed down.
¢ Close down ICL Pathway HAPS interfaces.

So the closure of the ICL Pathway HAPS interfaces is included in the Core
System Services and is not separately chargeable.

Yours sincerely,
