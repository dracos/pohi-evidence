                              DEFENCE AND COUNTERCLAIM




                                            Defence


1.       Paragraphs I to 5 of the Particulars of Claim are admitted.


2.       As to paragraph 6 of the Particulars of Claim., it is admitted that by March 2004 there
         was an apparent shortfall in the account of Marine Drive Post Office of £25,758,75.
         The Defendant avers however that the final audit, following which he was suspended
         by the Claimant, took place on 23 March 2004. Upon his suspension, the Claimant
         arranged for a temporary sub-postmaster to temporarily take over the Defendant's
        duties. In the premises, and without prejudice to the more general denial at paragraph
        4 below, any apparent losses sustained after 23 March 2004 (including the pleaded
        loss of £176 in relation to National Lottery game sales on 24 March 2004) are not
        attributable to the Defendant.


3.      In relation to the figure of £1,256.88 pleaded at paragraph 6 as a loss relating to
        "Automated products", the Defendant avers that this relates to the erroneous double-
        crediting of the sum to the National Savings & Investment Bank account of one Mrs
        Dorothy Constable (which for the complete avoidance of doubt was not done by the
        Defendant), which sure was repaid to the Claimant by Mrs Constable in January
        2005, Accordingly, it is denied that the Defendant has any liability in respect of that
        particular head of loss.

                                                                                                      10
                                                                                                POL00082222
                                                                                              POL00082222




            ARrarah 7 of the Particulars of Claim is denied.




 6.    The Defendant further avers that, upon disclosure by the Claimant of the daily
       balance snapshot documents created by the Defendant during the course of his tenure
       as sub-postmaster at Marine Drive Post Office, and which were removed from the
       post office on the Defendant's suspension, he will be able to demonstrate through a
       manual reconciliation of the figures contained within those snapshots that the
       apparent shortfalls are in fact nothing more than accounting errors arising from the
       operation of the Horizon system. The Defendant will plead further and more fully in
       this regard following disclosure.


7.     Paragraphs 8 to 10 of the Particulars of Claim are denied.


                                       Counterclaim


S.     The Defendant repeats paragraphs 1 to 7 above.


9.     The Defendant            that the Claimant wrongfully terminated the Defendant's
                        avers




      contract as a sub postmaster following his suspension and that the true cause of the
      apparent shortfall in the accounts of Marine Drive Post Office is the Claimant's own
      computer system not any misconduct or negligence on the part of the Defendant or
      his assistant.


10,   By reason of the Claimant's wrongful termination of his contract, the Defendant has
      suffered and continues to suffer loss:


                                        Particulars


      The Defendant is not yet fully able to particularise his counterclaim. However, the
      broad heads of Coss in respect of which the Defendant claims are as follow:


      (a)     loss of income as a suub-postmaster
                                                                                                                                  POL00082222
                                                                                                                                POL00082222




                       diminution in capital value of the Defendant's shop which previously shared
                       the same premises as Marine Drive Post Office; and


          (c)          loss of profits from the post office itself, and the associated reduction in
                       turnover at the Defendant's shop as a result of the removal by the Claimant of
                       the post office franchise from the premises.


  ii.     The Defendant is unable to quantify his counterclaim at this juncture but limits it to a
          figure not exceeding £250,000.


 12.     The Defendant also claims interest pursuant to section 69 of the County Courts Act
         1984 on such sums and for such period as the court shall consider appropriate.


 AND the Defendant counterclaims


         1.            Damages;
