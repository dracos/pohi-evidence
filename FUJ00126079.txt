the plan during the re-planning exercise key interim
milestones have been agreed with Post Office

* Of those milestones:

* 7 have been completed on schedule
+ 5 have been completed ahead of schedule
« 4 have been completed behind schedule

Of those milestones completed behind schedule, none impacted
the critical path
