Sue.

All scratchcards activated on the Camelot terminal must have a Client rem-in on the Horizon terminal for the
matching number of scratchcards. The Client rem-in must be made on the same day as the activation.
Anything other than that will create an error.

Scratchcard sales are in-house stock management. No TC’s are generated against sales figures entered to
Horizon.

All TC’s have been issued. An £800.00 debit has passed to late accounts.

I’ve just finished discussing Hightown with Chris Knight. The only thing I could highlight was the number of
scratchcard errors which were caused by client rem-in being made a day or so late. They cause a high number
of errors but didn’t create anything of worry financially, almost all rem-ins have been made to match up with

activations. Sales entries were made on a constant near daily basis. Nothing could be found as far as possible
missing sales.

She has made 115 stock from January 015 2008 onwards. An excessively high number for no obvious
reason. They total up to a positive stock adjustment of £1760.00.

There is nothing which can be found to explain the figures the Postmaster claims relate to the Lottery.
Hope this helps.

Regards
Neil

Neil — Miss Hall asked
if she had not remmed the scratchcards in but activated them would this cause a problem.

And She cuts of her scratchcards on the Weds morning when balancing so not including all the sales for the
Weds and wants to know if the problems are being caused by this

Neil — can you also advise please if there have been any further TCs issued
