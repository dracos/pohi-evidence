Dear John
REGINA v SUSAN JANE RUDKIN

STAFFORD CROWN COURT.
CONFISCATION HEARING ~ 21°" AUGUST 2009 AT 10AM

Thank you for your letter of the 1° May 2009,

It is noted that a Confiscation Timetable has been set and accordingly I have
passed this information on to the Investigation Manager and the Fraud Team.
Counsel in due course will need to be instructed to attend the hearing on the
21" August 2009 and I will leave a note for Jarnail to arrange for the copying of
all the financial documentation so that instructions can be sent to Civitas
Chambers.

Yours sincerely

Rob G Wilson
Head of Criminal Law
Criminal Law Division
