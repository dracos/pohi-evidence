Andy,

When requesting an ARQ, POL can ask for additional info. When that happens, the guys in Fujitsu processing the
request often come to me asking if the request can be made. At that point I can then tell them if the info is in the raw
logs and advise of any additional charges to pull that out as a 1-off. If this is the sort of thing you might want regularly,
then the POL security team could raise a CR (Change Request) to enhance the info in the standard report to include an
additional field (eg resp_code).

Does that give you what you need?

Regards

Gareth

Hi Gareth

We have found the field in Credence but the report only goes back 90 days so we can’t access summary data it seems. I
was hoping that if there was only the one transaction in the day I would have seen enough.

Do you know what route I should take to request the raw logs? Don’t go hunting if you don’t, I can start trawling here.

Andy,
The field you want is Resp_code.

This isn’t in the standard ARQ extract, but is available in the raw logs. itis also passed to Credence {as
RESPONSE_CODE}, but I don’t know if it is visible in the Credence reports.

A value of 10 indicates that the MA has requested a Referral, which means the Branch phoning up for an Auth Code
which they then key in. There is no way we can confirm if the bamk was phoned or a random value keyed in, but this

would at least indicated that there was a Referral.

I have access to data up to 6 month old (which should have included resp_code}, but I see that we’ve just missed that
timeframe.

if you can’t get RESPONSE_CODE from Credence, then you could request the raw logs (not part of the standard ARQ). If

this is likely to be a common requirement, then amending the standard ARQ to include Resp_code would be a simple
change, but require a CR.

Regards

Gareth

Hi Gareth

This is a scenario I have had before were we have issued a TC to a branch on a bureau card payment where our card
processor state that no authorisation call was made (implying that the branch manually input an authorisation code that
was not provided from the card processor) whereas the branch are adamant that authorisation was automatically

provided.

We normally do not progress these but I’m being put under pressure to provide evidence on this one. This may be the
type of enquiry we get from 2" Sight anyway so thought I would raise an ARQ.

I can’t see any more detail from what I got in Credence. Is there any way we can see the key strokes that would support
a manual authorisation being input?

Cheers
