THIS AGREEMENT is made the 28th day of July, 1999

BETWEEN:

(1)

(2)

(C)

(D)

and amended (the "Codified Agreement"), Fujitsu Services provides certain services to
Post Office;

The Codified Agreement came into effect on 28 July 1999;

changes to and restated the Codified Agreement;

Various changes have been made to the Codified Agreement since 31 December 2002,

Office costs;
(b) subject to certain agreed exceptions, the continued provision to the Post

Office of services equivalent in their business outcome to the services
provided immediately prior to the introduction of the changes;

(c) fixed and variable pricing with variable elements based on the use of

31st March 2023 . The Expiring Services shall expire on 31st March 2016 and 31st March
2017 as set out in the Codified Agreement (unless otherwise extended), with all other
Services (save where terminated early in accordance with the terms of this Agreement)
continuing until 31st March 2023.

On March 9th , the Parties signed CCN1638 in order to make certain changes to the
Codified Agreement in order to implement an updated service delivery framework,
attached hereto as Schedule I.

in the Codified Agreement (save where terminated early in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement) with all Continuing Services continuing until 31st March 2024 (unless
otherwise extended).

Development and documentation of HNG-X

Post Office shall develop the Requirements Baseline for the HNG-X Service Infrastructure

process in the manner described in that Schedule.

Fujitsu Services shall, subject to Clause 10.5, design and develop the HNG-X Service
Infrastructure (other than the Associated Changes) and the Business Capabilities and
Support Facilities:

to Schedule B6.1);

5.2.2 in accordance with the HNG-X Assumptions and the Solution
Architecture; and

5.2.3 in accordance with the provisions of Schedule B6.2 (as supplemented by

be amended under the Change Control Procedure, to the extent necessary, to be
consistent with the Solution Baseline (together with any rectification plans and
workarounds agreed pursuant to Schedule B6.3).

Until the date on which Schedules B3.2, B3.3 and B3.4 and all other documents in the
Solution Baseline Documentation Set are amended pursuant to Clause 5.4, Fujitsu
Services’ obligations under this Agreement in relation to the HNG-X System shall be
determined by reference to the Solution Baseline (and any subsequent changes to the
HNG-X System agreed pursuant to the Change Control Procedure) rather than those
Schedules and documents.

Save where the reference to XP is to it as the existing operating system, until such time
as a CCN to introduce a replacement operating system for NT (as envisaged by
paragraph 1.4 of Schedule C3) has been agreed by the Parties, any references to “XP”
in any of the Schedules, CCDs or CRDs, or to “Microsoft”, as the provider of XP, shall

10.13.1 Subject to Fujitsu Services’ compliance with Clause 10.13.2, Fujitsu Services may
suspend the delivery of the Payment and Banking Service at any time, without liability to
Post Office, in the following circumstances:

(a) Fujitsu Services legitimately thinks, acting in accordance with Good
Industry Practice, that the Ingenico Software, Ingenico Central Platform and/or
Payment and Banking Solution is at risk of, or is undergoing, a major attack (in
particular, an attack by hackers or a virus);

(b) Post Office, or any of its employees or contractors, engage in suspected
fraudulent or unauthorised use impacting a significant proportion of the Service

request from a regulator, a court, the police or any other competent authority.

10.13.2 Fujitsu Services shall: (a) ensure any suspension of the delivery of the Payment
and Banking Service is reasonable and proportionate in the circumstances (in
terms of the risk posed and impact of a suspension, the extent of the Services or
part of the Services suspended and the duration of such suspension); (b) ensure
that Post Office is treated no less favourably than other customers of Ingenico
that are affected by the matter that has given rise to the suspension; (c) use
reasonable endeavours to provide as much advance notice as is reasonably
possible in the circumstances prior to suspension (and Post Office acknowledges
that it may not be possible for any notice to be provided in certain circumstances);
(d) throughout the period of suspension, update Post Office on a regular basis
(with the regularity to be reasonably assessed on the urgency or scale of the
suspension); and (e) use best endeavours to resolve, or provide assistance to
Post Office as required to resolve, the grounds for suspension as soon as
reasonably practicable to the extent that such grounds for suspension relate to a
Fujitsu Services’ systems or scope of responsibility. Where the grounds for
suspension relate to any Post Office or Post Office third party systems or
infrastructure or in the case of Clause 10.13.1(b) then the Parties will work
together in good faith as required to attempt to resolve the grounds for
suspension as soon as reasonably practicable.

10.14 Post Office acknowledges that some of the hardware and software Fujitsu Services
utilised to deliver the Services is either at the end of its service life or about to become
end of service life and it is the responsibility of Post Office to procure replacements to

month EOSL Roadmap. Where Fujitsu Services identifies a need for such a replacement
in the EOSL Roadmap, Fujitsu Services shall discuss with Post Office at the quarterly
end of service life review whether there are alternatives to replacing the hardware and/or
software, such as procuring uplifted vendor support in respect of the relevant hardware
or software, Post Office shall promptly (and in any event within ten (10) Working Days of
the quarterly end of service life review) choose to either:

(a) as applicable, procure the replacement to, the relevant hardware or software;

(b) subject to clause 10.15, accept the risk of potential degradation of the
Operational Services by either: (i) rejecting such replacement; or (ii) electing
to implement an agreed alternative.

Where a degradation of the Operational Services arises out of an end of service life issue
on the hardware or software which has been identified to Post Office in the EOSL
Roadmap and which Post Office has chosen not to replace, Fujitsu Services shall have
no liability for such degradation in the Operational Services to the extent that it relates to
limitations in the standard support that the hardware or software vendor is no longer
providing

Policies and Standards
Each of the Parties shall comply with the obligations imposed on it by Schedule A4.

The Parties agree that provision of the Payment and Banking Services by Fujitsu Services

Post Office of such Regulatory Change and the Parties shall meet to discuss the
Regulatory Change. Thereafter Fujitsu Services shall be entitled to terminate the

Where Post Office Foreground IPR or Licensed IPR subsists in software within Fujitsu
Services or its Sub-contractors’ possession or control, Fujitsu Services shall, at the
request of Post Office, provide Post Office with one up-to-date copy (and other copies as
may reasonably be requested) of that software (in both Source Code and object code

In the event that Fujitsu Services, a member of the Fujitsu Services Group or its HNG-X

for the purposes of performing the Services to any third party, Fujitsu Services shall
ensure that such assignment or transfer is subject to the licences granted hereunder and
shall notify Post Office of such transfer or assignment as soon as reasonably practicable.

Each Party undertakes (at no additional charge) to do all such things and execute all such
documents as may be reasonably required to give full effect to any assignment or licence
made or granted hereunder of, in the case of Fujitsu Services, Post Office Foreground
IPR, Licensed IPR or Fujitsu Background IPR and, in the case of Post Office, Intellectual

indemnity given by Post Office pursuant to Clause 34.3). For the avoidance of
doubt, this shall not apply to the Post Office's receipt of Microsoft Azure Services
to the extent such services are provided by Microsoft to Post Office pursuant to
the Customer Agreement or to any services provided by any third party in respect
of provision of the Post Office Cloud; and

Default in question is caused by an Agent, such licence shall only be terminated
in relation to Use by such Agent. Upon termination of the relevant licence to Post
Office, Post Office shall cease to use the software or document which is the
subject matter of such licence and shall either return or destroy all copies of such

IPR owned by Third Parties

Post Office acknowledges and agrees that all Intellectual Property Rights in Horizon Third
Party Software and Third Party Items (excluding Intellectual Property Rights in Third Party
Items required to be assigned to Post Office pursuant to Clause 29) shall remain vested
in the relevant third party proprietor of those rights.

In consideration of the payment of the relevant Charges:

30.6.1 subject to Clauses 30.11 and 30.12, Fujitsu Services hereby grants or shall grant,
as the case may be, to Post Office a perpetual (subject to Clause 30.6.3), royalty-
free, irrevocable and non-exclusive sub-licence:

(a) to Use Horizon Third Party Software and HNG-X Third Party Software;
and

(b) to use Third Party Items (other than HNG-X Third Party Software);

in each case where Fujitsu Services has procured the rights to grant such sub-
licences; or

30.6.2 subject to Clause 30.11, if Fujitsu Services is unable to procure the right to grant
the sub-licence referred to in Clause 30.6.1, having used all reasonable
endeavours to procure such right, Fujitsu Services shall procure that the relevant
third party grants to Post Office a royalty-free and non-exclusive licence:

(a) to Use Horizon Third Party Software and HNG-X Third Party Software;
and

(b) to use Third Party Items (other than HNG-X Third Party Software),

and shall use all reasonable endeavours to ensure that such licence is perpetual
(subject to Clause 30.6.3) and irrevocable.

30.6.3 Each of the sub-licences and/or licences granted or procured pursuant to this
Clause 30.6 in respect of Horizon Third Party Software shall terminate upon the
later of:

(a) the occurrence of Trigger Point T6 (Counter Application Rollout

Agreement or, in the case only of “Windows NT Workstation” (identified
as Horizon Third Party Software in Schedule B4.1), the date when that
software is no longer used in the provision or receipt of the HNG-X
Services in accordance with this Agreement.

Each of Post Office's sub-licences and licences under Clauses 30.6.1 and 30.6.2
respectively shall be subject to any additional terms and conditions imposed by the
licensor, provided that any terms of any such sub-licence or licence shall not detract from
the rights granted to Post Office hereunder. Without prejudice to the generality of the
foregoing, Post Office accepts the licence terms relating to the Escher Upgrade Software
set out in Schedule B4.1 and that such terms satisfy the requirements of this Clause 30.7.

Fujitsu Services shall use all reasonable endeavours to enable a third party engaged by
Post Office to use Horizon Third Party Software subject to and in accordance with this
Agreement on behalf of Post Office provided that such third party shall have entered into
an appropriate Agreed Form NDA.

Post Office shall be entitled to copy Horizon Third Party Software and HNG-X Third Party
Software in order to create as many archival or back-up copies of the same as are
necessary. When copying such software, Post Office shall include the original machine
readable copyright notice, and a label affixed to the media identifying the software and
stating: "This medium contains an authorised copy of copyrighted software which is the
property of [the Third Party Software Owner]."

In respect of any Non-standard Third Party Material to be (i) included in or used as part
of the HNG-X Service Infrastructure or the Business Capabilities and Support Facilities,
or (ii) used to provide or receive the HNG-X Services over the HNG-X Service
Infrastructure, Fujitsu Services shall procure such rights for Post Office to use those
materials as are set out in Clause 48.8, such rights only to be granted in accordance with
the provisions of Clause 48.8 (in each case as if references to Fujitsu Background IPR
were to the IPR in the Non-standard Third Party Material). Without prejudice to Post
Office's rights and remedies under this Agreement, in the event that Fujitsu Services
cannot procure such rights, it shall not procure the development or make use of that Non-
standard Third Party Material in connection with this Agreement without the prior written
consent of Post Office and shall, at Post Office's request and at no additional charge to
Post Office:

30.10.1 provide Post Office with such information as it may reasonably request in order
to understand and assess the reasons for, and the benefits of, the use of that
Non-standard Third Party Material (including, without limitation, identifying any
alternative software or materials which possess substantially equivalent
functionality, performance and interoperability to that of the Non-standard Third
Party Material and in relation to which the above rights can be obtained with
minimum additional costs or restrictions); and

Post Office acknowledges and agrees that Fujitsu Services may be unable and, if so,
shall not be obliged to fulfil its obligations pursuant to Clauses 30.6.1, 30.6.2 or 30.17 (as
the case may be) in respect of an item of Horizon Third Party Software or a Third Party
Item in the event that an act or omission of Post Office gives rise to a right for the
proprietor of the relevant item of Horizon Third Party Software or Third Party Item to:

30.11.1 terminate its licence to Fujitsu Services of the relevant item of Horizon Third Party
Software or Third Party Item;

30.11.2 terminate its licence to Post Office of the relevant Horizon Third Party Software
or Third Party Item; or

30.11.3 require Fujitsu Services to terminate its sub-licence to Post Office of the relevant
Horizon Third Party Software or Third Party Item.

In the event that Post Office is in breach of a sub-licence of an item of Horizon Third Party
Software or a Third Party Item granted pursuant to Clause 30.6.1 and Fujitsu Services
reasonably believes that Post Office's breach will result in the termination of Fujitsu
Services’ right to use such Third Party Item:

30.12.1 Fujitsu Services shall give Post Office notice in writing specifying the breach and
requiring Post Office to remedy that breach within 30 days of receipt of such
notice; and

30.12.2 if Post Office fails to remedy the breach within 30 days of receipt of such notice,
Fujitsu Services may by notice in writing terminate the relevant sub-licence.

In the event that a sub-licence is terminated pursuant to Clauses 30.11 or 30.12.2, Fujitsu
Services shall not be liable for any failure or delay in providing any Service to the extent
that the failure or delay is caused by the cessation of Post Office's right to use the material
or thing the subject of that sub-licence, provided that Fujitsu Services has used its
reasonable endeavours to continue providing the affected Service or Services to the
extent possible and to mitigate the impact of the failure or delay. Fujitsu Services shall
provide such assistance as Post Office may reasonably require in order for Post Office to
assess, and procure the necessary rights to use, suitable replacement materials to those
the subject of the terminated licence.

Subject to any necessary consents (which Fujitsu Services shall use all reasonable
endeavours to obtain) in relation to Horizon Third Party Software, HNG-X Third Party
Software or other materials or things in which the Intellectual Property Rights are owned
by a third party, any licence or sub-licence granted by Fujitsu Services to Post Office
hereunder:

30.14.1 shall be transferable in accordance with the provisions of Clause 58.3; and

and (ii) by Post Office for a Design Purpose, shall be entitled to have access to and use

30.15.2 Post Office agrees:

(a) that (irrespective of ownership of the Intellectual Property Rights in Developed
Documentation) it will not use or permit to be used any Horizon Design
Documentation for any purpose other than a Design Purpose;

(b) not to disclose Horizon Design Documentation to any third party save where such
disclosure is required for a Design Purpose and the third party to whom it is
disclosed has (1) entered into such confidentiality commitments as Fujitsu
Services may reasonably request (written confirmation of which shall be provided
by Post Office to Fujitsu Services prior to release of such documentation), and (2)
delivered a written undertaking to Fujitsu Services that it will use such Horizon
Design Documentation solely for the Design Purposes; and

(c) access to and use of any Horizon Design Documentation in accordance with this
Clause 30.15.2 shall not serve to transfer any Intellectual Property Rights in the
documentation or information contained therein to the Post Office or any third
party.

30.15.3 For the purposes of determining ownership of, and any licences granted in respect of,
Intellectual Property Rights in any Specially Commissioned Design Documentation, such
documentation shall be deemed to fall within the definition of Developed Documentation
or Specially Written Documentation, whichever is applicable. Licences granted by Fujitsu
Services under Clause 30.1 in respect such Specially Commissioned Design
Documentation that is deemed to be Fujitsu Developed Documentation shall be subject
to the additional restrictions imposed by Clause 30.15.2.

Deposited Software

30.16 Fujitsu Services shall place the Source Code of the Deposited Software in escrow with a
reputable escrow company agreed upon by the Parties (if the Parties are unable to agree
then the escrow company shall be NCC), on the basis of the appropriate standard

(subject to Clause 30.11) be irrevocable) to Use, reproduce, modify, adapt and enhance
(and to authorise a third party to Use, reproduce, modify, adapt and enhance) the Source
Code version of the Deposited Software. However, the foregoing licence shall only
become effective if Post Office becomes entitled to obtain access to the Source Code
version of the Deposited Software pursuant to the Source Code Escrow Agreement
referred to in Clause 30.16 and the licence shall be subject to any restrictions contained
herein in respect of the object code version of the Deposited Software.

the licence to use such Internal Code in combination with the said item of Hardware shall

of confidentiality which have been accepted by Post Office.

(a) agrees with Fujitsu Services’ concerns; and/or

(b) either (a) instructs Fujitsu Services to continue with the development cycle
in respect of that Queried Requirement in any event, in which case Post

Office shall indemnify Fujitsu Services under Clause 34.3.3, or (b) instructs
Fujitsu Services to implement the alternative requirement proposed under
Clause 34.5.1(a) in which case such alternative requirement shall form part
of the Requirements Baseline;

in the event that Post Office instructs Fujitsu Services to implement the alternative
requirement in accordance with Clause 34.5.2(b)(b), Fujitsu Services shall not be
able to invoke the process set out in this Clause 34.5 in respect of that alternative
requirement at any time after Post Office so instructs Fujitsu Services;

at all times during the process set out in this Clause 34.5, Fujitsu Services shall
provide Post Office with such assistance as Post Office may reasonably require
in order to understand and assess the risk notified to it and the alternative
requirement proposed by Fujitsu Services, provided that the Parties hereby
acknowledge that each Party shall be responsible for forming its own assessment
of such risk and alternative requirement;

either Party may request, at any time prior to an instruction being given under
Clause 34.5.2(b), that the Parties meet to discuss a risk notified, or an alternative
requirement proposed, to Post Office by Fujitsu Services in accordance with this
Clause and to agree in good faith a course of action which is mutually beneficial
to the Parties. If the Parties are unable to agree on the relevant risk and either
Post Office does not give Fujitsu Services an instruction under Clause 34.5.2(b)
and/or the Parties are unable to agree the suitability of the alternative requirement
proposed, then the matter shall be escalated in accordance with the DRP set out
in Annex 2 of Schedule A2 (Governance), up to and including the stage set out at
paragraph 3 of such Annex (Executive Review), provided that references in that
Annex to “five Working Days” shall be read as “two Working Days” for the
purposes of this Clause;

if, following the earlier of (i) the escalation of the matter and completion of the
process set out in Clause 34.5.5; or (ii) the date falling ten Working Days after the
date upon which the matter was first escalated in accordance with Clause 34.5.5,
the Parties are not able to agree on the risk or the suitability of the alternative
requirement proposed and Post Office fails to instruct Fujitsu Services to continue
with the development cycle in respect of that Queried Requirement, then Fujitsu
Services shall:

(a) be entitled to reject that Queried Requirement (such rejected Queried
Requirement being a "Rejected Requirement"), provided that in the event
that Fujitsu Services disagrees with any advice and guidance of a
Facilitator obtained as part of the escalation process, it shall provide Post
Office with a reasonably detailed statement of its reasons for doing so; and

(b) achieve the relevant Development Obligation for such Rejected
Requirement; and

in the event that Fujitsu Services rejects a Queried Requirement pursuant to this
Clause 34.5 and Fujitsu Services would, if it had complied with Clause 34.4, have

known about the risk relating to that Rejected Requirement earlier than the date
on which it actually became aware of that risk and notified the Post Office
pursuant to Clause 34.5.1, then Fujitsu Services shall refund to Post Office any
Charges paid or payable by Post Office in respect of development work
undertaken by or on behalf of Fujitsu Services in relation to that Rejected
Requirement in that intervening period (but excluding any Charges in respect of
development work which Fujitsu Services is able to demonstrate to the
reasonable satisfaction of Post Office is of continued use and benefit to Post
Office),

The indemnities set out at Clause 34.3.1 shall not apply to any Ul Development
Requirement to the extent that (a) Fujitsu Services or a member of the Fujitsu Services
Group was engaged by Post Office for the purposes of the development of that UI
Development Requirement and contributed to that Ul Development Requirement and (b)
such contribution resulted in the infringement or alleged infringement referred to in Clause
34.3.1.

In the event that, pursuant to Clause 34.5, Fujitsu Services rejects a Queried Requirement
in respect of which (a) Fujitsu Services or a member of the Fujitsu Services Group was
engaged by Post Office for the purposes of the development of such Queried
Requirement and (b) contributed towards such Queried Requirement, then (without
prejudice to any other rights or remedies available to Post Office) Fujitsu Services shall
refund to Post Office the Charges paid or payable by Post Office in respect of that
contribution.

Common Indemnity Provisions

Each Party shall promptly notify the other if any claim or demand is made or action
brought against it to which this Clause 34 applies.

The Party giving an indemnity under this Clause 34 (the “Indemnifying Party”) shall, at its
own expense, conduct any litigation arising therefrom and all negotiations in connection
therewith and the Party receiving the indemnity (the “Indemnified Party”) hereby agrees
to grant to the Indemnifying Party exclusive control of any such litigation and such
negotiations in relation to the indemnified infringement or alleged infringement. The
Indemnifying Party shall consult with and pay due regard to the interests (including, where
the Post Office is the Indemnified Party, the commercial interests of the Royal Mail Group
and the public interest and where Fujitsu Services is the Indemnified Party the commercial
interests of the Fujitsu Services Group) and views of the Indemnified Party in the conduct
of any defence to any claim or demand hereunder, and shall, where it is reasonable to do
so taking into account also the interests of the Indemnifying Party, comply with such
interests and views.

The Indemnified Party shall, at the request of the Indemnifying Party, afford to the
Indemnifying Party all reasonable assistance for the purpose of contesting any claim or
demand made or action brought against the Indemnified Party to which the indemnity may
apply or any claim or demand made or action brought against the Indemnifying Party to
which the indemnity may apply. The Indemnifying Party shall reimburse the Indemnified

Party for all reasonable costs and expenses (including but not limited to legal costs and
disbursements on a solicitor and client basis) incurred in so doing.

The Indemnified Party shall not make any admissions which may be prejudicial to the
defence or settlement of any claim, demand or action for infringement or alleged
infringement brought against the Indemnified Party to which the indemnity may apply or
any claim or demand made or action brought against the Indemnifying Party to which the
indemnity may apply.

If a claim or demand is made or action brought to which the indemnity may apply or in the
reasonable opinion of the Indemnifying Party is likely to be made or brought, the
Indemnifying Party may at its own expense either:

34.12.1 modify any or all of the affected documents, software, materials, items or other
things whatsoever without reducing the performance and functionality of the
same, or substitute alternative items, products or services of equivalent
performance and functionality for any or all of the documents, software, materials,
items or other things whatsoever, so as to avoid the infringement or the alleged
infringement but without disrupting the performance of the Services, provided that
the terms herein shall apply mutatis mutandis to such modified or substituted
items or services and such modified or substituted items shall be acceptable to
the Indemnified Party (whether by passing any form of acceptance testing or
otherwise), such acceptance not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and
shall reimburse the Indemnified Party all reasonable costs directly incurred by it;
or

34.12.2 procure a licence to use the affected documents, software, materials, items or
other things whatsoever on terms which afford to the Indemnified Party no more
extensive rights than those originally applicable hereunder and which are
acceptable to the Indemnified Party and shall reimburse the Indemnified Party all
reasonable costs directly incurred by it.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Clause 34:

34.13.1 to the extent that any actual or alleged infringement, to which this Clause 34
applies, relates to the development by Fujitsu Services under this Agreement of
the HNG-X Service Infrastructure or the Business Capabilities and Support
Facilities and does not result from (i) a breach by Fujitsu Services of the Clean
Room Rules or paragraph 4.2 of Annex 2 to Schedule B6.2 (ii) a failure by Fujitsu
Services to comply with Clause 15.1.5, or (iii) a breach by Fujitsu Services of
Clause 34.4; and

34.13.2 provided that the HNG-X Development Completion has not occurred at the time
of the claim, demand or action in respect of such infringement,

the costs of undertaking any modification or substitution or procuring a licence that may
be made or obtained pursuant to Clause 34.12 shall be treated as a normal cost of
development and Post Office shall pay Fujitsu Services:

(a) for such modification work on a time cost basis, subject to and in
accordance with the provisions of Schedule D8; and

(b) in respect of any such substitution or licence, an amount equivalent to
Fujitsu Services’ cost of the product used as a substitute and/or of the
necessary licence, multiplied by 95 and divided by 100.

The indemnities set out in this Clause 34 (other than where Clause 34.3.1(b) applies)
shall not apply insofar as any such claim or demand or action is in respect of:

34.14.1 any use by or on behalf of the Indemnified Party of the affected documents,
software, materials, items or other things whatsoever in combination with any
item not supplied or approved (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed) by the Indemnifying Party where such combined use directly gives rise
to the claim, demand or action; or

34.14.2 any modification carried out by or on behalf of the Indemnified Party to any item
supplied by the Indemnifying Party under this Agreement if such modification is
not authorised by the Indemnifying Party in writing; or

34.14.3 any use by the Indemnified Party of the affected documents, software, materials,
items or other things whatsoever in a manner not reasonably to be inferred from
their specification (if any) or the requirements of the Indemnified Party (including,
without limitation, where Post Office is the Indemnified Party, the Requirements
Baseline).

If the Indemnifying Party has availed itself of its rights to modify the affected documents,
software, materials, items or other things whatsoever or to supply substitute products or
services pursuant to Clause 34.12.1 or to procure a licence under Clause 34.12.2 and
such exercise of the said rights has avoided any claim, demand or action for infringement
or alleged infringement, or if the Indemnified Party has unreasonably withheld its
acceptance of any items modified or substituted by the Indemnifying Party in accordance
with Clause 34.12, then the Indemnifying Party shall have no further liability thereafter
under this Clause 34 in respect of the said claim, demand or action.

If a modification or substitution in accordance with Clause 34.12.1 is not possible so as
to avoid the infringement and the Indemnifying Party has been unable to procure a licence
in accordance with Clause 34.12.2, then Clause 34.1 or Clause 34.3 (as the case may
be) shall apply.

This Clause states the entire liability of:

34.17.1 Fujitsu Services with regard to the infringement of any Intellectual Property Right
by the use or possession of the things listed in Clause 34.1 by or on behalf of
Post Office or in connection with the Services;

34.17.2 Post Office with regard to the infringement of any Intellectual Property Right by
the use or possession of the things listed in Clause 34.3 by or on behalf of Fujitsu
Services; and

Post Office Responsibilities

Subject to paragraph 2.3 of Schedule A5, Post Office undertakes (at its own cost and
expense save where otherwise provided in or pursuant to this Agreement) to perform the
Post Office Responsibilities. Post Office shall use all reasonable endeavours to perform
such Post Office Responsibilities in a timely fashion or, where specified, in accordance
with the HNG-X Programme Plan or any other agreed timetable specified in this
Agreement.

Without limitation to Clause 39.1, Post Office shall use all reasonable endeavours to
ensure that its Agents, and any of the Post Office Cloud Sevice Providers co-operate with
Fujitsu Services to the extent reasonably necessary to permit Fujitsu Services to perform
the Services. In the event that any Agent or Post Office Cloud Service Provider fails to
provide such co-operation, and Post Office is unable to secure such co-operation:

(a) from an Agent within six months after receiving written notice thereof from Fujitsu
Services; or

(b) from any Post Office Cloud Service Provider within fifeen (15) Working Days after
receiving written notice from Fujitsu Services thereof,

then Fujitsu Services shall be relieved of liability for any failure or delay to perform the
Services which is directly caused by the Agent's or Post Office Cloud Service Provider's
failure to provide such co-operation and shall be entitled to any reasonable additional
costs and expenses which Fujitsu Services can show were directly incurred by it as a
result of the Agent's or Post Office Cloud Service Provider's failure to provide such co-
operation.

Without prejudice to the provisions of paragraph 13 of Schedule B6.2 or Schedule A5,
Fujitsu Services shall not be liable to Post Office for any failure to perform or delay in
performing its obligations under this Agreement where Fujitsu Services proves that such
failure or delay has been directly caused by the failure of Post Office to perform any of
the Post Office Responsibilities.

This Clause 39.3 shall not apply in the circumstances to which Clause 43.6 applies, which
shall be governed by the specific rule stated in Clause 43.6.

In addition to the provisions of 39.3, in the event that the Post Office fails to perform or
delays performing its obligations regarding the processing of reference data for the
introduction of new, or updates to existing, APOP applications as described in the CCD
entitled “Fujitsu Services / Postt Office Ltd Interface Agreement for Operational Business
Change — Reference Data ” (CS/PRD/058) then in so far as such non-performance results
in costs being incurred by Fujitsu Services in rectification activities then such costs shall
be reimbursable by the Post Office to Fujitsu Services.

Post Office Obligations inserted by CCN 1400 shall be applicable to provisions relating to
the Towers Model only including but not limited to Clauses 39A, 39B and 39C and
Schedule F. Provisions relating to Post Office Responsibilities shall continue to apply in

Office Obligations.

39.6 39.6 Post Office acknowledges and agrees that in the event of a failure or a delay in the
performance of its Responsibilities, or any obligations of third parties under Post Office's
control, in each case which Fujitsu Services can demonstrate has directly affected wholly
or partially the performance of the Payment and Banking Service by Fujitsu Services then
Fujitsu Services shall not be responsible for non-compliance with its obligations directly
affected by such failure or delay. Fujitsu Services shall use reasonable efforts to mitigate
the consequences of the relevant Post Office failure or delay in the performance of its
obligations, and to continue to provide the Payment and Banking Services in accordance
with the relevant Service Level Targets

39A Effect on Service Levels of Post Office Cause or Tower Contractor Cause

39A.1 This Clause 39A is without prejudice to the obligations of Fujitsu Services to provide the
Services in accordance with the Agreement.

39A.2 _ If Fujitsu Services has failed to provide the Services in accordance with the Service
Levels as a direct result of a Post Office Cause, or a Tower Contractor Cause, Fujitsu
Services shall continue to provide the Services to the extent it is able in accordance with
the Service Levels but may apply for relief as set out in Clause 39A.3.

39A.3 To the extent that Fujitsu Services reasonably believes that Fujitsu Services would have
provided the Services in accordance with the Service Levels but has failed to do so as a
direct result of a Post Office Cause, or a Tower Contractor Cause, Fujitsu Services may
make a written submission to Post Office within 3 months of the commencement of the
Post Office Cause or the Tower Contractor Cause. Fujitsu Services shall not be entitled
to any relief, to the extent that Fujitsu Services cannot demonstrate to Post Office's
reasonable satisfaction that:

39A.3.1 Fujitsu Services’ failure to provide the Services in accordance with the Service
Levels is a direct result of a Post Office Cause, or a Tower Contractor Cause
(identifying the specific Post Office Obligation or Tower Contractor
Responsibility that has not been met);

39A.3.2 Fujitsu Services made all reasonable efforts to mitigate the consequences of
the relevant Post Office Cause or Tower Contractor Cause, and to continue to
provide the Services in accordance with the Service Levels; and

39A.3.3 Fujitsu Services’ failure to provide the Services in accordance with the Service
Levels arose from a cause beyond Fujitsu Services’ reasonable control.

39A.4 Post Office will consider any submission under Clause 39A.3 and advise Fujitsu Services
of its proposal in respect of a submission promptly and in any event within 15 Working
Days of receipt. If Fujitsu Services does not accept Post Office's submission, the Parties

accordance with the Service Levels but has failed to do so as a direct result of a Post
Office Cause or a Tower Contractor Cause and has demonstrated compliance with
Clauses 39A.3.1 to 39A.3.3 inclusive then:

by Post Office Cause or Tower Contractor Cause as if it had not occurred
provided that Fujitsu Services mitigates those Charges to the extent that it is

In order to claim the rights and reliefs in Clause 39A.5, Fujitsu Services’ submission
pursuant to Clause 39A.3 will be provided within 15 Working Days after it has notified
Post Office of a claim that Clause 39A.2 applies and that Fujitsu Services is applying for

with schedule A2 and, failing resolution through governance within 15 Working Days,
such Party may refer the dispute for resolution in accordance with the Dispute Resolution

causes of, and mitigate the effects of such failure.

Costs incurred due to Post Office Cause or Tower Contractor Cause

In this Clause 39B, claims for reimbursement of additional costs and expenses may be
claimed insofar as the Parties have not agreed to recompense Fujitsu Services elsewhere
in this Agreement. Where the Parties have agreed to recompense Fujitsu Services
elsewhere in this Agreement, Fujitsu Services may not make any claim under this Clause
39B.

If Fujitsu Services reasonably believes that it has incurred additional costs and expenses
as a direct result of steps taken by Fujitsu Services in carrying out any additional work or
services to remedy or mitigate an issue caused by a Post Office Cause or Tower
Contractor Cause, then Fujitsu Services shall claim for reimbursement of those additional
costs and in accordance with the claim process set out in Clause 39B.3.

reimbursement of additional costs and expenses necessarily and reasonably incurred as
a direct result of steps taken by Fujitsu Services in carrying out any additional work or
services to remedy or mitigate an issue caused by a Post Office Cause or Tower
Contractor Cause. Fujitsu Services shall not be entitled to any additional costs and
expenses, unless Fujitsu Services can demonstrate to Post Office's reasonable
satisfaction that:

39B.3.1 Fujitsu Services could not have avoided the effect on the provision of the
Services and/or on its ability to perform its obligations under the Agreement by
using all reasonable endeavours to eliminate or mitigate the consequences of
the delay in accordance with Good Industry Practice and having regard to the
scope of the Services for which Fujitsu Services is responsible; and

39B.3.2 costs incurred were reasonable, demonstrable, necessarily and reasonably
incurred and that Fujitsu Services used all reasonable endeavours to minimise
such costs,

and Fujitsu Services will provide any additional information that Post Office may
reasonably require in order to assess the validity of Fujitsu Services’ claim.

Post Office will consider any submission under Clause 39B.3 and advise Fujitsu Services
of its proposal in respect of a submission promptly and in any event within 15 Working
Days of receipt. If Fujitsu Services does not accept Post Office's submission, the Parties
shall meet within 5 Working Days of Fujitsu Services’ receipt of Post Office's proposal
and shall use reasonable endeavours to agree the amount of compensation applicable
to Fujitsu Services. Either Party may invite other interested Tower Contractors to the
meeting and in that event shall inform the other Party.

The agreed costs will be shown as an additional amount on the next Operational Charges
invoice due to be issued under this Agreement. If no Operational Charges invoice is due
to be issued then Fujitsu Services will issue an invoice.

In the event of a dispute, either Party may refer the matter for resolution in accordance
with schedule A2 and, failing resolution through governance within 15 Working Days,
such Party may refer the dispute for resolution in accordance with the Dispute Resolution
Procedure. Pending the resolution of the Dispute both Parties will continue to resolve the
causes of, and mitigate the effects of such failure.

Fujitsu Services acknowledges that in respect of a Post Office Cause or a Tower
Contractor Cause, a materiality threshold applies in respect of costs claimed for
reimbursement pursuant to Clause 39B.3 and that Fujitsu Services will not be entitled to
claim for reimbursement of costs pursuant to that Clause unless and until additional costs
and expenses incurred by Fujitsu Services in consequence of the circumstances listed in
Clause 39B.2 in respect of each individual Post Office Cause or of each individual Tower
Contractor Cause exceed £5,000.

39C — Effects of a Fujitsu Dependency Failure

39C.1 For the avoidance of doubt, prior to the earlier of notification to Fujitsu Services of the
appointment of the Post Office Service Integrator by Post Office or the termination of any
Terminable Service and the contracting of a replacement for said service by Post Office
with a Tower Contractor under its Towers Model, there shall be no Fujitsu Dependencies.

39C.2 Upon agreement of any Fujitsu Dependencies, Fujitsu Services undertakes to notify Post
Office as soon as reasonably practicable after becoming aware that it has not, will not, or
is unlikely to fulfil any Fujitsu Services Dependency or will be delayed from doing so (a
“Fujitsu Dependency Failure”). In the event that Post Office has not been notified by
Fujitsu Services in accordance with this Clause 39C.2 but Post Office is aware or
becomes aware of a Fujitsu Dependency Failure, then Post Office shall notify Fujitsu
Services of such Fujitsu Dependency Failure.

39C.3 Notwithstanding actions to be taken under any Incident management process to resolve
a Fujitsu Dependency Failure, within 5 Working Days after providing notice or receiving
notice under Clause 39C.2, Fujitsu Services shall submit a report relating to the Fujitsu
Dependency Failure (the “Fujitsu Dependency Failure Report”) to Post Office setting
out full details of the reasons for, the issues arising out of and the steps which Fujitsu
Services is taking to minimise the impact of the Fujitsu Dependency Failure on Post Office
and/or the Tower Contractors to the extent to which the potential impact of a particular
Fujitsu Dependency Failure was agreed as part of the agreement of the particular Fujitsu
Dependency. In addition, it shall notify Post Office of the actions it intends to take to
prevent the recurrence of the Fujitsu Dependency Failure in the future.

39C.4 Fujitsu Services shall take reasonable steps to perform its obligations under the Agreement
and use its reasonable endeavours to take precautions which it ought reasonably to have
taken in accordance with Good Professional Practice in order to avoid or mitigate the
potential impacts of the Fujitsu Dependency Failure on Post Office, and/or the relevant
Tower Contractors.

39C.5 Fujitsu Services shall co-operate and work with Post Office, the Tower Contractors and/or
any third parties (as reasonably directed by Post Office) to mitigate the Fujitsu
Dependency Failure.

39C.6 In the event of a Post Office Cause or Tower Contractor Cause, Fujitsu Services shall co-
operate, support, collaborate and work with Post Office, other Tower Contractors and/or
any third parties (as reasonably directed by Post Office) so that Post Office and/or

Dependency Failure (including where appropriate the preparation of a root cause
analysis).

Post Office may make a written request to Fujitsu Services seeking reimbursement of
demonstrable additional costs and expenses necessarily and reasonably incurred as a
direct result of steps taken by Post Office and/or a Tower Contractor in carrying out any
additional work or services to remedy or mitigate an issue caused by a Fujitsu
Dependency Failure (the “Compensation Amount”). Post Office shall make any claim
for a Compensation Amount within 3 months of commencement of the Fujitsu
Dependency Failure. Post Office shall not be entitled to any Compensation Amount for
itself or any Tower Contractor unless Post Office can demonstrate to Fujitsu Services’
reasonable satisfaction that:

39C.8.1 Post Office and/or the Tower Contractor could not have avoided the effect on the
provision or receipt of the relevant services and/or on its ability to perform its
obligations under its agreement(s) by using all reasonable endeavours to
eliminate or mitigate the consequences of the delay in accordance with Good
Industry Practice; and

39C.8.2 costs incurred were reasonable, demonstrable, necessarily and reasonably
incurred and that Post Office and/or the Tower Contractor used all reasonable
endeavours to minimise such costs,

and Post Office will provide any additional information that Fujitsu Services may
reasonably require in order to assess the validity of Post Office's request.

39C.9 Fujitsu Services will consider any request under Clause 39C.8 and advise Post Office of

its proposal in respect of the Compensation Amount promptly and in any event within 15
Working Days of receipt. If Post Office does not accept Fujitsu Services’ proposal, the
Parties shall meet within 5 Working Days of Post Office's receipt of Fujitsu Services’
proposal and shall use reasonable endeavours to agree the Compensation Amount
applicable. Either Party may invite other interested Tower Contractors to the meeting and
in that event shall inform the other Party.

39C.10 The agreed Compensation Amount will be shown as a credit on the next Operational

39C.11

Charges invoice due to be issued under this Agreement. If no Operational Charges
invoice is due to be issued then Post Office will issue a credit note.

In the event of a dispute under this Clause 39C, either Party may refer the matter for
resolution in accordance with Schedule A2 and, failing resolution through governance
within 15 Working Days, such Party may refer the dispute for resolution in accordance
with the Dispute Resolution Procedure. Pending the resolution of the Dispute both Parties
will continue to resolve the causes of, and mitigate the effects of such failure.

39C.12 Post Office acknowledges that in respect of a Fujitsu Dependency Failure, a materiality

threshold applies in respect of costs claimed for reimbursement pursuant to Clause 39C.8
and that Post Office and/or any other Tower Contractor will not be entitled to claim for
reimbursement of costs pursuant to that Clause unless and until additional costs and
expenses incurred by Post Office and/or any other Tower Contractor in consequence of

Fujitsu Services’ Personnel

Post Office reserves the right under this Agreement to refuse to admit to any premises
occupied by or on behalf of any member of the Royal Mail Group (which expression shall
in this Clause 40 include all persons employed or engaged by the Royal Mail Group and
all persons other than Fujitsu Services and its sub-contractors providing services to the
Royal Mail Group), or to any Branch any person employed or engaged by Fujitsu
Services, or by a sub-contractor, whose admission would be, in the reasonable opinion
of Post Office, undesirable.

lf and when directed by Post Office, Fujitsu Services shall provide a list of the names and
addresses of all persons who it is expected may require admission in connection with the
performance of this Agreement to any premises occupied by or on behalf any member of
the Royal Mail Group or to any Branch, specifying the capacities in which they are
concerned with this Agreement and giving such other particulars as Post Office may
reasonably require. Fujitsu Services shall comply with any reasonable directions issued
by the designated representative of Post Office as to which persons may be admitted to
such premises and at what times.

If and when directed by Post Office, Fujitsu Services shall secure that any person
employed or engaged by Fujitsu Services or by a sub-contractor, who is specified in the
direction or is one of a class of persons who may be so specified, shall sign a statement
that he understands that the Official Secrets Acts 1911 to 1989 apply to him both during
the term of and after the expiry or termination of this Agreement.

Fujitsu Services' representatives, engaged within the boundaries of a Royal Mail Group
establishment or Branch, shall comply with such rules, regulations and requirements
(including those relating to security arrangements) as may be in force from time to time
for the conduct of personnel when at that establishment or Branch and when outside that
establishment or Branch.

The decision of Post Office as to whether any person is to be refused admission to any
premises occupied by or on behalf of the Royal Mail Group or to a Branch shall be final
and conclusive.

Fujitsu Services’ Key Personnel

The Parties acknowledge that the Key Personnel are essential to the fulfilment of Fujitsu
Services’ obligations hereunder.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Clause 61, Post Office shall keep the CCD
entitled “Fujitsu Services Key Personnel” (HR/CON/001) (including any proposed or
agreed amendments to it) and the information contained in it (“Personnel Information”)
confidential. Except as provided for in this Clause 41.2, Post Office shall not copy,
reproduce or disclose Personnel Information to any third party.

Fujitsu Services undertakes to use all reasonable endeavours to ensure that the Key
Personnel are not removed or replaced for the duration of the activities relevant to them
(described as “Tasks” in the CCD entitled “Fujitsu Services Key Personnel”
(HR/CON/001)). However, in the event that any of the Key Personnel become unavailable
for any reason (including without limitation death, injury, sickness, promotion or
resignation), Fujitsu Services shall have the right upon giving 30 days’ notice in writing
(or such shorter period of notice as may be reasonably practicable) to Post Office to
replace such an individual with another individual whose abilities and qualifications are
appropriate for the services to be performed by such individual.

The Parties acknowledge and agree that in order for Fujitsu Services to successfully
complete its obligations under this Agreement, additional key personnel may be identified
after the date of this Agreement. The Parties shall identify and agree any such additional
key personnel (together with any activities which are relevant to them).

Injury to Persons; Loss of Property

Subject always to Post Office's proper observance of its obligations under this Clause 42
and except where paragraphs 5.2 or 6.3.3 of Schedule B1.3 apply, Fujitsu Services shall
fully indemnify Post Office in respect of any personal injury or loss of or damage to
Property incurred by Post Office, its contractors or their respective employees and
authorised agents to the extent that such personal injury or loss of Property is caused by
any Default of Fujitsu Services, its employees or agents in connection with the
performance or purported performance of this Agreement.

In the event of any claim or demand being made or action brought to which Clause 42.1
applies, Fujitsu Services shall be promptly notified thereof and Fujitsu Services shall at
its own expense conduct all negotiations for settlement of the same and any legal
proceedings that may arise therefrom. Fujitsu Services shall consult with and pay due
regard to the interests and views of Post Office (including the commercial interests of the
Royal Mail Group and the public interest) in the conduct of any defence to any claim or
demand hereunder, and shall, where it is reasonable to do so, comply with such interests

make any admissions which may be prejudicial to the defence of such claim or demand
or action.

Notwithstanding Clause 42.2, Post Office shall have the option to take over the conduct
over any claim, demand or action to which this Clause applies. Should Post Office
exercise the aforementioned option it shall indemnify Fujitsu Services against any loss,
damage, cost or expense which it incurs in respect of that claim, demand or action over

prior to Post Office exercising its option) at which Fujitsu Services was prepared to settle

Subject to Clauses 44.4A, 44.4B and 44.5, the financial limits specified in Clause 44.2.2

statutory duty or otherwise in relation to the subject matter of this Agreement, including,
without limitation, all claims arising for Defaults, all claims for liquidated damages and
Post Office Additional Cost pursuant to Clause 18, Schedule C1 and/or the provisions of
the Service Descriptions, all claims to be indemnified pursuant to Clauses 34, 42 or 43
and all other claims or costs which are compensatable in money or money's worth as
though all such claims for monetary relief represented liability for Defaults occurring in
the period in question.

For the purposes of Clauses 44.2 and 44.4,

a liability or claim for monetary relief arises when the act, omission, event or
circumstance giving rise to that liability or claim occurs; and

Notwithstanding that Clause 44.2 is stated to be subject to Clause 44.4, Clause 44.4
shall not limit:

and additional to any liability of Post Office to pay any Charges, other amounts, the
Transfer Payment, the Termination Charge, any Partial Termination Charge or the HNG-
X Termination Charge which may become properly due and payable to Fujitsu Services

Subject always to Clause 44.1, in no event shall either Party be liable to the other Party
for indirect or consequential loss or damage. However:

(a) Fujitsu Services acknowledges and agrees that it shall not be entitled to
claim that a loss incurred by a Tower Contractor is an indirect loss solely
because it was not incurred by the Post Office. As such, any loss
incurred by a Tower Contractor that would have been a direct loss if it
had been incurred by the Post Office shall, for the purposes of
determining a Compensation Amount, be deemed to be a direct loss;
and

(b) Post Office acknowledges and agrees that all claims that Fujitsu
Services may make for relief under Clause 39A.3 or Clause 39A.5.3
and for compensation under Clause 39B.3 including for any payments
under Clause 39B.5 shall be made to Post Office and not any of the
Tower Contractors and that all payments of such relief or compensation
shall be by Post Office and not any Tower Contractor.

The provisions of Clause 44.6 shall not be taken as limiting the right of Post Office to
claim from Fujitsu Services for:

44.7.1 additional operational and administrative costs and expenses; and/or

44.7.2 expenditure or charges rendered unnecessary as a result of any Default by Fujitsu
Services; and/or

44.7.3 any compensation arising out of a Fujitsu Dependency Failure due to Post Office,
Post Office Service Integrator or a Tower Contractor.

The Parties expressly agree that should any limitation or provision contained in this
Clause be held to be invalid under any applicable statute or rule of law it shall to that
extent be deemed omitted but if any Party thereby becomes liable for loss or damage
which would otherwise have been excluded such liability shall be subject to the other
limitations and provisions set out herein.

For the avoidance of doubt, it is acknowledged that nothing in this Agreement shall be
deemed or construed to relieve either Party of its common law duty to the other Party
against which a claim may be made to mitigate any loss which is the subject of such
claim.

Each of the sums referred to in Clauses 44.2.2, 44.2.3(a)(3), 44.3 and 44.10 shall be

the end of each subsequent Financial Year by an amount equal to the difference

45.

Clause 44.1, the aggregate liability of Fujitsu Services for all Defaults and all claims,
demands, actions, costs (including legal costs), expenses, losses and damages arising
from or incurred by reason of any breach by Fujitsu Services of the provisions of Clause
33.2 howsoever arising shall be limited in any Financial Year to 150% of the aggregate
annual Operational Charges in such Financial Year.

Insurance

Fujitsu Services shall to the extent reasonably possible insure or make provision for self-
insurance against all losses and damages which are the result of its fault or negligence
in performing the Services, including workman's compensation, public liability, product
liability, property damage and professional indemnity. Fujitsu Services will, if requested in
writing by Post Office, produce to Post Office a certificate of insurance showing the
applicable coverage currently in force, and will also give Post Office prior written notice
of (where possible), or written notice no later than 30 days after, alteration or cancellation
of such insurance.

PART G: TERMINATION AND EXIT

46. Term

46.1 The term of this Agreement shall, unless terminated earlier in accordance with the provisions

of Clause 47 or extended in accordance with the provisions of Clause 46.2, be for a period
commencing on the 28 July 1999 and ending on 31 March 2024.

46.2 Post Office may, in its absolute discretion extend the term of this Agreement, by a further

one year period by giving notice to Fujitsu Services on or before 318 March 2023 of its

Services if they expire on the dates set out above.

Both Parties acknowledge that Post Office may request further extensions to the Expiring
Services. Both Parties agree to act reasonably in the event of any such request and any
associated negotiation of terms. In particular, Fujitsu Services agrees to mitigate its costs
of supply and stranded costs with respect to any further extension of the Expiring Services
to the extent that it is reasonably possible to do so having regard to, amongst other things,
the timing of any request relative to the expiry date of the Expiring Services.

The Terminating Services shall cease on 31st March 2023 unless terminated earlier by
Post Office in accordance with Clause 47.10.2(a)(ii) of the Agreement. The Parties

relation to Third Party Software, Third Party Items or Non-standard Third Party
Materials), except in respect of Fujitsu Services Subcontract agreement with
Ingenico for Payment and Banking Service which Fujitsu Services shall assign or
novate where required in accordance with clause 58.6.3, entered into by Fujitsu
Services which are necessary to the performance of the Services as Post Office
may designate,

provided that, if termination is in respect of a Terminable Service rather than the entire
Agreement, the above provisions shall apply only to those Project Assets (or, in the case
of agreements, that part thereof) that are not reasonably required by Fujitsu Services for
the provision of any continuing Services under this Agreement.

Notwithstanding the generality of Clause 48.1 Post Office agrees:

48.2.1 only to exercise its rights under such Clause to the extent that the relevant Project
Assets apply to, and are required for the provision or receipt of the Services or
Terminable Services that are the subject of the termination or expiry or are
otherwise to be provided pursuant to Schedule E (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, the Exit Plan);

48.2.2 the rights provided for in Clauses 48.1 shall not apply to the Superstock Solution;
and

48.2.3 in the case of Partial Termination of the Engineering Service, that it shall acquire
or shall ensure that the Next Supplier acquires from Fujitsu Services all of the
Project Assets referred to in Clause 48.1.1 that relate to the Engineering Service
comprising the Counter Equipment used in Branches up to the network
connection sockets in each Branch, as well as spare Counter Equipment held by
Fujitsu Services intended for such use.

In the event that Post Office exercises any of the options in Clause 48.1 or Clause 48.2.3
applies, Post Office shall pay to Fujitsu Services on completion of such option or, in the
case of Clause 48.2.3, such acquisition, a sum equal to the Transfer Payment. If Post
Office exercises the option in Clause 48.1 in respect of any Partial Termination or in
respect of the expiry of an Expiring Service or Clause 48.2.3 applies, the Project Assets
acquired by it shall cease to form part of the Infrastructure and this Agreement shall be

an agreement for services with Post Office) to any employee or sub-contractor
(being an individual) (“Worker”) of Fujitsu Services who has during the six months

accepts such offer Fujitsu Services shall release that Worker from any breach of
contract with it (other than in relation to such person's obligations of confidentiality
and notice of termination) which such acceptance may otherwise involve.

All the assets to be acquired pursuant to the exercise by Post Office of its option under
Clause 48 shall be acquired and any software, documents materials or other things
provided by Fujitsu Services pursuant to the licences granted under Clauses 48.8 to 48.13
shall be provided “as is", but (apart from such licences) free from encumbrances and the
Parties agree that all express and implied warranties and conditions relating to such

(COM/MGT/REP/0001) with details of all Software data, tools, utilities, documentation
and other items necessary to perform the Services and run the Applications (and to
indicate those that relate exclusively to a Terminable Service or Expiring Service and
those that are shared between one Terminable Service or Expiring Service and another
Service or Services), and to agree, in accordance with the guidance contained in that
CCD, the most appropriate treatment of such item. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Agreement, the categorisation and proposed treatment of such items agreed in
that CCD shall take precedence over Clause 48.13 which shall be deemed superseded
by such CCD when agreed by the Parties.

In the event that:

48.7.1 a Terminable Service is terminated pursuant to Clause 47.10.1 or 47.10.2; or

Subject to Clause 58.5 Post Office hereby consents to Fujitsu Services having
subcontracted its obligations specified in Schedule C2 to the respective sub-contractors
specified therein. Additional or substitute sub-contractors may be approved from time to
time in accordance with Clause 58.1 after the date hereof, in which case Schedule C2
shall be amended accordingly. Fujitsu Services may permit its Subcontractor, Ingenico,
to further subcontract to one of its group undertakings (as defined in Section 1161 of the
Companies Act 2006) located within the European Union and the Australian affiliate
provided in Schedule C2 to deliver the Payment and Banking Service without the prior
consent of Post Office, provided that such Fujitsu Services’ Subcontractor provides notice
in writing to Post Office within one (1) month of such subcontracting. Notwithstanding any
sub-contracting permitted in this Agreement, Fujitsu Services shall remain primarily
responsible for the acts and omissions of its sub-contractors committed by them in the
course of performing or purporting to perform any of Fujitsu Services' obligations on
Fujitsu Services' behalf as though such acts or omissions were its own.

Post Office shall be entitled to assign, novate or otherwise dispose of its rights and
obligations under this Agreement or any part thereof (including, where appropriate,
requiring the grant by Fujitsu Services or its licensors of a direct licence of any Software
other than Third Party Software, and requiring Fujitsu Services to use all reasonable
endeavours to procure the grant of a direct licence or obtain consent to the transfer of the
sub-licence of any Third Party Software) to any other body which performs any of the
functions that previously had been performed by Post Office, provided that any such
assignment, novation or other disposal shall not increase the burden of Fujitsu Services’
obligations pursuant to this Agreement.

Post Office shall be entitled to disclose, to the extent necessary for the purposes of this
Agreement, to any transferee any Confidential Information of Fujitsu Services which
relates to the performance of the Services by Fujitsu Services. In such circumstances
Post Office shall authorise the transferee to use such Confidential Information only for
purposes relating to the performance of the Services and for no other purposes and, for
the avoidance of doubt, the transferee shall be bound by the confidentiality undertaking
contained herein in relation to such Confidential Information.

The consent referred to in Clause 58.2 and any approval which may be granted in respect
of additional or substitute sub-contractors pursuant to Clause 58.2 is provided, and shall
be granted (as the case may be), on the understanding that Fujitsu Services shall keep
Post Office informed of the general nature and scope of the work to be sub-contracted
and the duration of the relevant sub-contracts (such information to be recorded in
Schedule C2) and shall consult with Post Office prior to amending or supplementing such
arrangements or commitments and shall take account of all reasonable requests and
comments that Post Office shall make in connection therewith.

Fujitsu Services shall procure that the Subcontract agreement with Ingenico for the
Payment and Banking Service shall contain the following terms:

58.6.1 such Subcontract may, subject to 48.6.3, be novated to Post Office or its nominee
at any time, and provided that Post Office remains in ultimate ownership of the
Crown at the time of novation, and the terms of such novation shall provide that
the Subcontract is amended following novation such that:

(a) the Subcontract is capable of extension at the option of the entity to whom

the Subcontract has been novated for up to two (2) periods of one (1) year

each;

on the extension dates, the service charges (but not transaction charges)

under the Subcontract shall be increased by the annual percentage

increase in the Retail Prices Index during the previous twelve (12) months;

Ingenico shall cooperate, acting reasonably and in good faith, with the entity

to whom the Subcontract has been novated to carry out any necessary

integrations to new systems required as a result of the novation; and

(d) any additional required integration will be agreed between the parties
through the change control procedure; and

(e) terms equivalent to clauses 20.1 and 30.21.2.

Further, Fujitsu Services shall not make any material amendment or variation to
its subcontract in respect of the Payment and Banking Services with its
Subcontractor Ingenico (including any amendments to the charges and fees
payable thereunder, the term, the licences of intellectual property, applicable
service levels or the provisions mandated by this clause) without the prior written
consent of Post Office.

Where Post Office wish for the Fujitsu Services’ Subcontract agreement with
Ingenico for the Payment and Banking Service to be novated to a Post Office
nominee, Post Office shall provide details of the Post Office nominee as soon as
reasonably practical. Where there are Grounds for Rejection which gives rise to
a legitimate commercial reason for Fujitsu Services’ Subcontractor, Ingenico, not
wanting to contract with the Post Office nominee, Fujitsu Services shall promptly
notify Post Office of these and shall provide reasonable evidence to support such
Grounds for Rejection. Fujitsu Services shall procure that its Subcontractor,
Ingenico, shall in good faith enter into discussions with Post Office to attempt to
resolve any such Grounds for Rejection. Where Fujitsu Services’ Subcontractor,
Ingenico, does not provide approval to Fujitsu Services’ Subcontract agreement
with Ingenico for the Payment and Banking Service being novated to the Post
Office nominee, such Subcontract will instead be novated to Post Office. For the
purpose of this clause 13.3, “Grounds for Rejection” shall mean the following:

(a) the Post Office nominee has a credit rating of less than BBB as classified by
Standard & Poor's or an equivalent rating by another comparable credit
rating agency;

(b) the Post Office nominee has committed fraudulent behaviour, criminal
activity, or breach of a regulator's requirement;

(c) the Post Office nominee is subject to any trade, economic or financial
sanction or embargos;

(d) integration of Fujitsu Services’ Subcontractor, Ingenico, into the Post Office
nominee would give rise to a security and/or data protection risk to Fujitsu
Services’ Subcontractor, Ingenico;

(e) the Post Office nominee provides services similar to the Services in
competition with Fujitsu Services’ Subcontractor, Ingenico;

(f) the Post Office nominee is involved in or has been involved in litigations with
Fujitsu Services’ Subcontractor, Ingenico, or a member of its group;

(g) contracting with the Post Office nominee would have a negative tax impact
on Fujitsu Services' Subcontractor, Ingenico; and/or

ability to service new or existing customers.

Non-Solicitation

Subject to Clause 48.4.3, neither Party shall during the currency of the Agreement or for
a period of six months thereafter without the written permission of the other (not to be
unreasonably withheld) either on its own account or for any other person, firm or
undertaking either directly or indirectly knowingly solicit or entice away from the other (the
"Previous Employer") any Key Individual who is then or shall have been in the previous
three months either:

59.1.1 an employee of the Previous Employer; or

59.1.2 engaged by the Previous Employer as a contractor performing the services of
such an employee.

In the event that such Key Individual is employed or engaged by the other Party with the
agreement of the other Party (such agreement to include without limitation agreed transfer
of work and associated staff between the Parties during the term of the Agreement) or
after redundancy from the Previous Employer, the Previous Employer shall not (unless
agreed otherwise) be paid any sum by the other Party by way of compensation.

If either Party is in breach of this condition that Party will pay to the other Party by way of
liquidated damages and not by way of penalty the Solicitation Fee.

Nothing in this Clause 59 is intended to prevent or frustrate the right of any individual to
seek employment as he thinks fit.

Force Majeure

For the purposes of this Agreement the expression "Force Majeure" shall mean any cause
affecting the performance by a Party hereto of its obligations arising from acts, events,
omissions, happenings or non-happenings beyond its reasonable control including (but
without limiting the generality thereof) (i) Governmental Regulations (subject to
Clause 60.7), (ii) fire, (iii) flood, or (iv) any disaster or an industrial dispute affecting a third
party. Any act, event, omission, happening or non-happening will only be considered
Force Majeure if it is not attributable to the wilful act, neglect or failure to take reasonable
precautions of the affected Party, its agents or employees, and only if a substitute third
party is not reasonably available (having regard, without limitation, to the cost and quality
of such substitute) to perform the affected obligation. In no event shall any fraudulent act
or omission by any third party or Party in relation to the Services for which Fujitsu Services
is liable under Clause 43.1 constitute a Force Majeure event.

Neither Party hereto shall in any circumstances be liable to the other Party hereto for any
loss of any kind whatsoever including but not limited to any damages or abatement of

Charges whether directly or indirectly caused to or incurred by the other Party by reason
of any failure or delay in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement which is
due to Force Majeure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Party shall use all reasonable
endeavours to continue to perform, or resume performance of, such obligations under
this Agreement for the duration of such Force Majeure event. In the case of any such
failure or delay on the part of Fujitsu Services, the Parties shall agree an orderly process
for such continuation or resumption of performance (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), and Fujitsu Services shall comply with such process. Fujitsu
Services shall remain liable to perform the Business Continuity Services, save where
such Business Continuity Services are themselves also affected by Force Majeure, in
which case Fujitsu Services shall be required to use all reasonable endeavours to perform
such Business Continuity Services.

If Fujitsu Services shall become aware of circumstances of Force Majeure which give rise
to or which are likely to give rise to any such failure or delay on its part it shall forthwith
notify Post Office within one Working Day and shall inform Post Office of the period which
it is estimated that such failure or delay shall continue. If Post Office shall become aware
of circumstances of Force Majeure which give rise to any such failure or delay on its part,
it shall forthwith notify Fujitsu Services within one Working Day and shall inform Fujitsu
Services of the period which it is estimated that such failure or delay shall continue.

It is expressly agreed that any failure by Fujitsu Services to perform, or any delay by
Fujitsu Services in performing, its obligations under this Agreement which results from
any failure or delay in the performance of its obligations by any person, firm or company
with which Fujitsu Services shall have entered into any contract, supply arrangement or
sub-contract or otherwise shall be regarded as a failure or delay due to Force Majeure
only in the event that such person firm or company shall itself be prevented from or
delayed in complying with its obligations under such contract, supply arrangement or sub-
contract or otherwise as a result of circumstances of Force Majeure and there is no
substitute person, firm or company reasonably available (having regard, without
limitation, to the cost and quality of such substitute) to perform the affected obligation.

If any Force Majeure event prevents any Party from performing its obligations hereunder
for a period in excess of 90 consecutive days, Post Office may after consulting with Fujitsu
Services and taking into account Fujitsu Services’ views, terminate this Agreement in
accordance with Clause 47.1.5.

Extension of Time

If the performance of this Agreement by either Party is delayed by reason of any Force
Majeure event (as defined in Clause 60.1), both Parties shall be entitled to a reasonable
extension of time subject to there being no entitlement to any additional costs or expenses
incurred as a result of the delay. The Party so delayed shall notify the other Party in writing
within one Working Day of becoming aware of the Force Majeure event.

In the event that it is anticipated that the Transfer Regulations will apply on the
commencement of the POLSAP Services so that employees of Post Office, its agents or

Fujitsu Services provide Fujitsu Services a list providing details of the terms of
employment of all personnel who are then employed wholly or mainly (at least 51 per
cent. of their working time or as otherwise agreed by the parties) in the performance of
the relevant services as reasonably required by Fujitsu Services, save that nothing in this
Clause 75.2 shall have the effect of requiring Post Office to produce information in breach
of the Data Protection Act 1998 or in breach of any express duty of confidentiality which
Post Office or its agents or contractors may owe to their respective personnel. In such
circumstances, Post Office shall use its reasonable endeavours to obtain appropriate
consent for the release of such information.

Post Office shall fully indemnify Fujitsu Services (on its own behalf and on behalf of any
sub-contractor) from and against:

75.3.1 any and all liabilities which Fujitsu Services or any sub-contractor incurs in
connection with or as a result of any claim or demand whatsoever by any

termination save to the extent such claim or demand:

reasonable legal fees) arising out of or in connection with any failure by Post
Office or any of its agents or contractors to comply with its or their obligations
under Regulation 13 of the Transfer Regulations save to the extent such failure
is attributable to the failure of Fujitsu Services to comply with its obligations under
the same Regulation.

In the event that the Transfer Regulations apply on the commencement of the POLSAP
Services, Fujitsu Services shall indemnify Post Office (on its own behalf and on behalf of
its agents and contractors) against:

75.4.1 any costs, liabilities, awards, decisions, losses and expenses (including

reasonable legal fees) arising out of or in connection with any failure by Fujitsu
Services or its sub-contractors to comply with its obligations under Regulation 13
of the Transfer Regulations;

75.4.2 any costs, liabilities, awards, decisions, losses and expenses (including

reasonable legal fees) arising out of or in connection with any change in the terms
and conditions of employment of the employees identified within the relevant
employment details referred to in Clause 75.2 made by Fujitsu Services or its
sub-contractors on or after the transfer date or any change in the terms and
conditions of the employment of the employees identified within the relevant
employment details referred to in Clause 75.2 proposed by Fujitsu Services or its
sub-contractors and whether before, on or after the transfer date but only to the
extent in each case such change or proposed change in the terms and conditions
of employment constitutes a repudiatory breach of the relevant employee's
contract of employment or involves a substantial change in his working conditions
to his material detriment; and

75.4.3 any costs, liabilities, awards, decisions, losses and expenses (including

reasonable legal fees) arising out of or in connection with any act or omission of
Fujitsu Services or its sub-contractors in respect of the employment or

interpreting the same:

75.5.1 the Party first informed of it shall notify the other within ten (10) business days
after becoming aware of the same;

re-engagement which is made and any such offer which is accepted by any such
individual; and

made to such individual in accordance with Clause 75.5.3 or is not accepted by
such individual within fifteen (15) business days of the date of notification under
Clause 75.5.2, Fujitsu Services may terminate his contract of employment at any
time not later than twenty (20) business days after the date of notification under
Clause 75.5.2.

As soon as possible following any notice of termination being given, or any termination
without notice, of all or part of the relevant services under this Agreement and no later
than six months prior to the expiry of an Expiring Service pursuant to Clause 46.3 and
46.4 or to the expiry of this Agreement at the end of the term set out in Clause 46.1,
Fujitsu Services shall at the request of Post Office provide to Post Office (or to Post Office
and the Next Supplier nominated by Post Office) a list providing details of the terms of
employment of all Fujitsu Personnel who are then employed wholly or mainly (at least 51
per cent. of their working time or as otherwise agreed by the parties) in the performance
of the relevant services under this Agreement as reasonably required by Post Office, save

duty of confidentiality which Fujitsu Services or its sub-contractors may owe to the Fujitsu
Personnel. In such circumstances, Fujitsu Services shall use its reasonable endeavours
to obtain appropriate consent for the release of such information.

thereof (the “Relevant Services”) Post Office may (without prejudice to Post Office's right
to request information pursuant to any other provision of this Agreement or pursuant to a
relevant legal obligation) request a Work Package from Fujitsu Services (agreement to

77 Belfast Datacentres

It is noted by both Parties that it has not been possible to conclude the extension to the
leases to the Belfast datacentres prior to 16th February 2016. To this end, there
remains a risk that the lease extensions will not be concluded and that Fujitsu Services
will be required to transition the hosted equipment to a replacement datacentre or
alternative service solution agreed by both Parties. In the unlikely event that this risk
crystalises such that Fujitsu Services has to exit a datacentre, Fujitsu Services shall not
be entitled to charge Post Office its own costs of moving and re-installing the equipment
(nor any moving and installing costs relating to Fujitsu Service's Sub-contractors or
suppliers). However, Post Office shall (and shall procure its third party suppliers, clients
and customers shall) facilitate such a transition (at no additional cost to Fujitsu
Services) by:

customers shall install and parallel run network connections needed to the
existing and new datacentres; and

76.2 participating (and procuring participation by its third party suppliers, clients and
customers shall participate) in the planning and implementation for the
connection migrations in line with an agreed project plan,

and a let on any relevant Service Levels to enable the movements and/or replacement
of the relevant hardware/infrastructure.

the extent of such conflict or inconsistency.

SCHEDULE A1
PREFERRED SYSTEMS INTEGRATOR
1. INTRODUCTION
1.4 In Clause 2 of this Agreement Post Office has stated that it is its present intention to appoint Fujitsu

Services as Preferred Systems Integrator with a wider scope of operation than the Infrastructure and
with the potential to include all Relevant IT Systems in that scope. The purpose of such appointment
would be to exploit the appropriate IT and services to drive Post Office's business strategy. This
Schedule sets out the rights and obligations of a Preferred Systems Integrator and the terms upon
which Post Office would be willing to appoint Fujitsu Services as the Preferred Systems Integrator.

1.2 The Systems Integration Partnership and Executive Relationship shall review opportunities to create
value for Post Office by Fujitsu Services taking on the Systems Integration of additional IT systems.
and services, and shall maintain a list of such opportunities in a Working Document.

2. SCOPE

21 For the purposes of this Schedule A1, “Preferred Systems Integrator” shall mean the person
appointed by Post Office from time to time to carry out the procurement, integration, provision and
management of any or all applications, infrastructure and services required by Post Office for the
purposes of integrating some or all of the following information technology systems:

2.1.1. any new IT system acquired by Post Office which is required by Post Office to interface with
the Infrastructure;

2.1.2 any existing IT system used by Post Office which interfaces or is required to interface with
the Infrastructure; or

2.1.3. any other IT system currently in use or acquired by Post Office after the Amendment Date
which is not required to interface with the Infrastructure, but excluding any system that is
provided as a shared information technology system with other parts of the Royal Mail
Group,

(each a “Relevant IT System”, together the “Relevant IT Systems’).

2.2 Subject to the Parties agreeing the terms for Systems Integration responsibility in accordance with
paragraph 4.1, such responsibility may involve the Preferred Systems Integrator undertaking the
provision of operating, support, development and maintenance activities associated with Systems
Integration using either its own resources or by procuring some or all of such associated activities
from subcontractors. Where such associated activities are procured from third parties, the Preferred
Systems Integrator shall remain solely responsible to Post Office for their provision.

3. APPOINTMENT

3.1 Nothing in this Agreement shall oblige Post Office to appoint Fujitsu Services as its sole Preferred
Systems Integrator. However, it is Post Office's present intention, subject to paragraphs 3.2 and 3.3,
to appoint Fujitsu Services as the Preferred Systems Integrator within twelve months of the
Amendment Date.

CONFIDENTIAL,

3.2 Post Office, at its sole discretion but acting reasonably in accordance with paragraphs 3.3, 3.4 and
3.5, shall determine:

3.2.1. when Fujitsu Services is first appointed as Preferred Systems Integrator;
3.2.2 which categories of Relevant IT Systems that initial appointment covers; and
3.2.3 the timing and extent of any subsequent additions to that scope.

3.3 Post Office's determination of the matters referred to in paragraph 3.2 shall be based on Post
Office's assessment of (a) the extent to which Fujitsu Services has met the criteria for selection of a
Preferred Systems Integrator as set out in paragraph 3.4, taking account of the matters set out in
paragraph 3.5 and (b) Fujitsu Services’ performance of its obligations under this Agreement as
monitored by Post Office and disclosed to Fujitsu Services in accordance with the processes set out
in Schedule A2.

3.4 Post Office's criteria for selecting a Preferred Systems Integrator will comprise the candidate's ability
to demonstrate (by reference where appropriate to any track record with Post Office) that it can, with
respect to large scale complex IT systems such as that used in relation to the Horizon Service

Infrastructure:

3.4.1 work collaboratively with other Post Office suppliers in delivering Post Office end to end
requirements;

3.4.2 manage third party service and product suppliers to deliver integrated solutions;
3.4.3 deliver continual improvements in levels of service;

3.4.4 deliver value for money to Post Office;

3.4.5 use innovation to improve Post Office competitiveness;

3.4.6 deliver application developments consistently within time, at or below cost budgets and to
required quality;

3.4.7 select supplier-independent products and services most appropriate to meet Post Office
requirements; and

3.4.8 adopt ways of working based on a relationship of mutual trust.

3.5 In evaluating Fujitsu Services' performance against the criteria set out in paragraph 3.4, Post Office
shall take account of the following:

3.5.1 Fujitsu Services' progress on completing Project HNG-X within time, at or below cost
budgets and to required quality;

3.5.2 the ability of Fujitsu Services SIP Team Members, and/or Fujitsu Services, to generate and
implement innovative ideas to either reduce Post Office costs or improve Post Office
efficiency;

3.5.3 Fujitsu Services recommending the selection of other companies’ (rather than its own)
products and services where these are demonstrably a better fit with Post Office's
requirements;

3.5.4 Fujitsu Services demonstrating in relation to at least one Service that they are best value for
money;

3.5.5 Fujitsu Services adopting new ways of working such as transparency on costing for new
proposals, not 'man marking’ (which means a situation where both Parties utilise individuals
to manage a Service or other aspects of the Services) and, where appropriate, adoption of
‘win-win' as the way of resolving issues; and

3.5.6 when considering additions to the scope of Fujitsu Services’ Preferred Systems Integrator
role, its performance of that role in relation to its existing scope.

3.6 Without prejudice to any Systems Integration activities being provided by Fujitsu Services under this
Agreement, Post Office reserves the right to seek competitive bids for any Systems Integration
activities in relation to Relevant IT Systems where it considers it would be in the best interests of
Post Office to do so. Fujitsu Services (having been appointed as Preferred Systems Integrator)
would be invited to bid in all such competitions.

3.7 The appointment of Fujitsu Services as Preferred Systems Integrator will be terminated with
immediate effect upon the termination or expiry of this Agreement.

3.8 The appointment of Fujitsu Services as Preferred Systems Integrator may be terminated or the
scope within which it has such a role reduced with immediate effect by Post Office in its sole
discretion:

3.8.1 should Fujitsu Services unreasonably refuse to accept responsibility for any Relevant IT
System nominated by Post Office in accordance with paragraph 4; or

3.8.2 should Fujitsu Services fail to fulfil its obligations under this Schedule A1.

3.9 Should Fujitsu Services be appointed as Preferred Systems Integrator and such appointment be
terminated or its scope reduced under paragraph 3.8, Fujitsu Services’ obligations under this
Agreement to provide Systems Integration activities for the HNG-X Services shall continue in
accordance with the other provisions of this Agreement.

4. RESPONSIBILITY

44 At any time following Post Office's appointment of Fujitsu Services as its Preferred Systems
Integrator, Post Office shall be entitled to nominate any Relevant IT System as a system for which
Post Office would like the Preferred Systems Integrator to assume responsibility and shall disclose
full details of the Relevant IT System to the Preferred Systems Integrator. The terms on which the
Preferred Systems Integrator assumes such responsibility shall be subject to agreement in
accordance with the Change Control Procedure.

4.2 Subject to the Parties agreeing the terms for Systems Integration responsibility in accordance with
paragraph 4.1, activities in relation to the Relevant IT System will commence within three months of

Schedule A1 Version 14.0

the date that such Relevant IT System is nominated for such responsibility by Post Office under
paragraph 4.1 or such other period agreed between the Parties.

43 Post Office shall facilitate discussions between the Preferred Systems Integrator and any current
supplier of products and/or services that are relevant to the nominated Relevant IT System. Where
requested by the Preferred Systems Integrator, Post Office shall use reasonable endeavours to
procure that Post Office's existing contracts with such suppliers that are relevant to the nominated
Relevant IT System are assigned to or novated in favour of the Preferred Systems Integrator.

44 Subject to the Parties agreeing the terms for Systems Integration responsibility in accordance with
paragraph 4.1, the Preferred Systems Integrator shall be responsible for all Systems Integration
activities in relation to each Relevant IT System which Post Office nominates to the intent that the
Preferred Systems Integrator shall ensure that:

4.4.1 each Relevant IT System meets the applicable service levels; and

4.4.2 the interoperability and performance across Relevant IT Systems meet the required service
and performance levels applicable to each Relevant IT System.

5. VALUE FOR MONEY

5.1 The Preferred Systems Integrator activities shall be subject to market testing. Where Fujitsu Services
is appointed as Preferred Systems Integrator, such market testing shall be carried out in accordance
with the principles set out in Schedule D6, without causing delay to any of the other Market Testing
activities described in that Schedule.

5.2 Where the Preferred Systems Integrator procures associated activities from a third party in
accordance with paragraph 2.2, the provision of those activities shall be subject to market testing.
Where Fujitsu Services is appointed as Preferred Systems Integrator, such market testing will be
conducted in accordance with the principles set out in Schedule D6 without causing delay to any of
the other Market Testing activities described in that Schedule and validated in accordance with the
provisions of Schedule D4.

6. LEGALITY
The provisions of this Schedule A1 shall apply to the extent permitted by law, including, but not
limited to, the provisions of the Competition Act 1998, Directive 2004/17/EEC and Directive

GOVERNANCE FOR OPERATIONAL SERVICES AND THE TOWERS MODEL

Fujitsu Services acknowledges that the supplier that Post Office chooses as its Post
Office Service Integrator for the new Towers Model may act as Post Office’s managing
partner. Subject to paragraphs 9.4 and 9.6 below, the Parties acknowledge and agree
that Post Office Service Integrator shall be entitled, on behalf of Post Office, to exercise
any rights or perform any obligations of Post Office under this Agreement, provided that
only Post Office shall be entitled to exercise its rights under Clauses 47, 58 and 66 of the
Agreement and paragraph 7 of Annex 2 to Schedule A2.

For the purposes of the Post Office Service Integrator performing its role as a managing
partner for the Post Office and subject to paragraphs 9.1 and 9.4, references in this
Agreement to Post Office shall be interpreted to refer to or include Post Office Service
Integrator as relevant. Post Office's opinion shall prevail in the event of any dispute as to
whether a reference refers to or includes the Post Office Service Integrator. Delegation
to the Post Office Service Integrator shall be without prejudice to Post Office's right to
exercise its rights under any provision of the Agreement on its own behalf. For the
avoidance of doubt, nothing in this paragraph 9 is intended to create a separate contract
between Fujitsu Services and Post Office Service Integrator or to assign or novate this
Agreement or any part of it to Post Office Service Integrator.

In the event that Post Office appoints the Post Office Service Integrator to manage some
or all of its IT services on its behalf, Fujitsu Services shall perform all its obligations owed
to Post Office under this Agreement to the Post Office Service Integrator as if the Post
Office Service Integrator is Post Office. To the extent that Fujitsu Services fails to perform
its obligations under the Agreement, Post Office retains the ability to enforce its rights
against Fujitsu Services and require it to perform those obligations. In the event that
either Party considers co-operation and collaboration between Fujitsu Services, Post
Office Service Integrator and other Tower Contractors is not in accordance with this
paragraph 9, then either Party may escalate the issue through the Dispute Resolution
Procedure.

Without prejudice to Post Office's right to exercise its rights under any provision of the
Agreement on its own behalf, in the event that Post Office Service Integrator exercises
the rights of Post Office under Clauses 23, 24 or 25 of the Agreement, Fujitsu Services
shall only be required to disclose details of the aggregated price of performing the
Services and not details of pricing for specific Services or details of the cost base it uses
to calculate such prices which may indicate Fujitsu Services’ pricing strategy or pricing
levels to Post Office Service Integrator.

Without prejudice to paragraph 9.1 above but subject to paragraph 9.6 below, the Parties
acknowledge and agree that Post Office Service Integrator shall be entitled to attend any
of the meetings described in this Schedule either in addition to Post Office or on behalf of
and as the representative of Post Office. The Post Office Service Integrator may in some
instances be the sole representative of Post Office at such meetings or governance
boards and will be responsible for the relationship relevant to those meetings or
governance boards. Where Post Office Service Integrator attends a meeting on behalf
of Post Office, Post Office Service Integrator shall be entitled to exercise such rights and

perform such obligations as Post Office would be entitled to exercise or perform at such
meeting.

Post Office shall ensure that it has a representative at the following governance boards
in addition to or instead of Post Office Service Integrator:

9.6.1 Executive Relationship;
9.6.2 Commercial Relationship; and
9.6.3 Acceptance Board Dispute.

As part of its transition to the Towers Model and in order to ensure the smooth and
effective delivery of end-to-end services to Post Office, Post Office may require its
suppliers of IT services to enter into good faith negotiations and agree non-disclosure
agreements with other Tower Contractors and/or other third parties ("NDA(s)”) and
operating level agreement(s) (“OLA(s)”) setting out each supplier's respective obligations
and dependencies to Post Office and each other supplier. Fujitsu Services shall, where
reasonably requested by Post Office, use its reasonable endeavours to enter into NDA(s)
and OLA(s) with Post Office Service Integrator and/or any Tower Contractors and/or any
other third parties within 3 months of such notification by Post Office. In the event that
Fujitsu Services has not or considers it will not be able to enter into NDAs and/or OLAs
within such 3 month timescale, Fujitsu Services shall promptly notify Post Office of any
issues preventing compliance with such 3 month timescale and the Parties shall work
together to address the issues in good faith within a reasonable timescale to be agreed
mutually. In the event that the Parties are unable to agree a reasonable timescale, either
Party may escalate the matter through the Dispute Resolution Procedure. For the
avoidance of doubt, Post Office shall not be a party to any such NDA or OLA.

Post Office may wish to make changes to the governance structure in this Agreement to
align with its new Tower Model and to implement changes associated with any OLA. All
such changes shall be managed as a change to the Agreement and implemented via the
Change Control Procedure. Fujitsu Services shall be entitled to charge for any additional
costs or risks as a result of changes to the existing governance structure in accordance
with the Change Control Procedure.

Fujitsu Services shall collaborate reasonably with Post Office Service Integrator and the
Tower Contractors by adopting Good Professional Practice in relation to collaborating and
co-operating with Tower Contractors to enable Post Office to maximize the benefit of the
strategic IT supply chain and optimal target operating model selected by Post Office for
its IT and change transformation programme including by:

9.9.1 responding to and following the Post Office Service Integrator's instructions,
including meeting all timescales, where provided in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement;

9.9.2 save as set out in the Agreement, reporting to the Post Office Service Integrator
as if it were Post Office;

Dispute Resolution Procedures
41. INTRODUCTION

21

2.2

3.1

The Parties shall use the Dispute Resolution Procedure to resolve any Dispute.

There may, subject to the other provisions of this Annex 2 to Schedule A2, be up to five
stages (each a "Stage") to the DRP as follows:

1.2.1 the Subject Lead Review to be carried out in accordance with paragraph 2;
1.2.2 the Executive Review to be carried out in accordance with paragraph 3;

1.2.3. the Board Review (including facilitation by an expert) to be carried out in
accordance with paragraph 4;

1.2.4 provided that the Parties agree to such procedure, mediation (to be carried out in
accordance with paragraph 6) or expert determination (to be carried out in
accordance with paragraph 7); and

1.2.5 where any mediation does not resolve the Dispute or the Parties do not agree to
the use of mediation or expert determination, or as otherwise provided for in this
Agreement, resolution through the courts of England.

The Parties may relax the timescales referred to in the DRP by mutual agreement (such
agreement not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

SUBJECT LEAD REVIEW

Subject to paragraph 2.2, as soon as either Party becomes aware of a disputed matter it
shall refer the Dispute to the Subject Leads best qualified to deal with the Dispute (taking
into account the nature of the Dispute and the responsibilities of each Subject Lead) for
resolution within five Working Days of the date of referral (the “Subject Lead Review’). If
the Dispute relates to the interpretation of this Agreement or to the amount or terms of
invoices, then the Dispute shall be referred to the Commercial Relationship for resolution.

As soon as either Party becomes aware of a disputed matter in relation to the SIP it
shall refer the Dispute to Executive Review described in paragraph 3.

EXECUTIVE REVIEW

In the event that the Subject Leads of the Relationship to which the Dispute is referred
under paragraph 2 fail to resolve that Dispute, the Dispute shall be referred to the
Systems Integration Partnership and Executive Relationship for resolution in accordance
with this paragraph 3 (the "Executive Review"). Each Party shall, no later than five
Working Days after such failure (or as soon as reasonably practicable if the Dispute is in
relation to the SIP), provide the other with a Statement of Dispute. If the Parties agree to

3.2

do so, such statements may be provided sequentially by one Party responding to the
Statement of Dispute of the other.

The Subject Leads of the Systems Integration Partnership and Executive Relationship or
other individuals nominated by each Party suitably empowered to deal with executive
matters (the “Nominated Executives”) will be responsible for collating all relevant
information relating to the Dispute and for progressing the Dispute through the DRP until
it is resolved or determined.

The Executive Review shall take place within ten Working Days of the referral with the
object of resolving the Dispute by way of good faith negotiation.

The Parties may agree, before the Executive Review referred to in paragraph 3.3 takes
place, or if that review fails to resolve the Dispute referred to it, to appoint an expert
facilitator (the “Facilitator”) to assist with resolution of the Dispute on the following basis:

3.4.1. The Facilitator will be appointed as soon as reasonably practicable;
3.4.2 The Facilitator shall be an individual who:

3.4.2.1 holds qualifications in respect of the subject matter underlying the
Dispute; and

3.4.2.2 is approved by both Parties (such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed).

3.4.3 In the event that the Parties fail to agree upon an individual as the Facilitator, the
Facilitator shall be appointed at the request of Post Office or Fujitsu Services
(whichever is the earlier) by the President for the time being of the Institution of
Engineering and Technology so long as such appointee shall meet the criterion
in paragraph 3.4.2.1.

3.4.4 The Facilitator shall act as a facilitator and not as an expert or arbitrator and his
fees shall be borne by the Parties in equal shares.

3.4.5 Within five Working Days of appointment of the Facilitator the Parties shall submit
to the Facilitator:

3.4.5.1 each Party's Statement of Dispute (as amended to reflect matters
discussed so far), such statement also to be disclosed to the
other Party; and

3.4.5.2 a joint agreed statement describing the scope of the initial
guidance required from the Facilitator.

3.4.6 The Dispute shall be referred to the Facilitator to obtain such initial guidance and
the Parties shall request that the Facilitator gives such guidance within 15
Working Days of receipt of the Statement of Dispute from both Parties. The

Facilitator shall not be required to determine the Dispute unless the Parties agree
that he shall be appointed as an Expert in accordance with paragraph 7.

3.4.7. Once the Facilitator has given to the Parties his initial guidance on the Dispute,
the Nominated Executives shall meet within five Working Days of the initial
guidance being given and attempt to resolve the Dispute with the advice and
guidance of the Facilitator within ten Working Days of the meeting.

BOARD REVIEW

If the Dispute is not resolved by the Executive Review, the Parties may, if both Parties
agree, refer the Dispute for review by (i) either or both of the Operations Director of the
Post Office and/or the Procurement Director of the Royal Mail Group plc and (ii) the
Commercial Division Director, Fujitsu Services (the “Board Review”).

The Board Review shall take place within five Working Days of the referral with the object
of resolving the Dispute by way of good faith negotiation.

If the Dispute is not resolved within ten Working Days of the Board Review, the Parties
may, if both Parties agree, refer the Dispute to a Mediator (for resolution in accordance
with paragraph 6) or to an Expert (for determination in accordance with paragraph 7).

If the Parties do not reach agreement whether (a) to refer the Dispute for resolution by
Board Review, within 15 Working Days of completing the Executive Review, or (b) to refer
the Dispute to a Mediator or an Expert pursuant to paragraph 4.3, either Party may seek
resolution of the Dispute through the courts of England. Notwithstanding the requirement
in paragraph 4.2, if the Board Review has not taken place within 20 Working Days of
referral, either Party may seek resolution of the Dispute through the courts of England.

STATEMENT OF DISPUTE

A “Statement of Dispute” means a signed and dated statement of a Subject Lead
containing the following information:

5.1.1. the name, job title, postal address and contact telephone number of the Subject
Lead making the statement on behalf of one Party and that of the Subject Lead
of the other Party to whom the statement is given (each such Subject Lead
being a “Dispute Owner’);

5.1.2 an adequate description of the Dispute, from the perspective of the Party on
whose behalf the statement is made;

5.1.3. any dates by which an output or decision is required for operational reasons; and

5.1.4 any recommendation for the resolution of the Dispute which the Dispute Owner
considers appropriate.

5.2.2 the output or decision required from the next Stage of the DRP,
to be used by or in connection with the next stage of the DRP.
MEDIATION

At any time after the Executive Review, the Parties may agree that the Dispute shall be
referred to mediation. In the event that the Parties agree to mediation, the Parties will be
responsible for appointing the mediator (the "Mediator"), but in the event that they are
unable to agree on a Mediator either or both of the Parties shall request the Centre for
Dispute Resolution ("CEDR") to appoint a Mediator.

The Parties shall, with the assistance of the Mediator, seek to agree the mediation
procedure. In default of such agreement, the Mediator shall act in accordance with CEDR
rules. The Parties shall, within five Working Days of the date on which the terms of the
mediation are settled, meet the Mediator in order to agree a programme for the exchange
of any relevant information and the structure to be adopted for the mediation.

Subject to agreement between the Parties, the mediation shall take place within 30
Working Days of the appointment of the Mediator.

EXPERT DETERMINATION

At any time after the Board Review, the Parties may agree that the Dispute shall be
referred to an expert ("Expert"), appointed by the Parties, for final determination of the
Dispute.

The Expert shall be appointed as soon as reasonably practicable and shall be an
individual who:

7.2.1 holds qualifications in respect of the subject matter underlying the Dispute in
question; and

7.2.2 is approved by both Parties (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed).

In the event that the Parties fail to agree upon the Expert to be appointed, the Expert shall
be appointed, at the request of Post Office or Fujitsu Services, by the President for the
time being of the Institution of Engineering and Technology so long as such appointee
shall meet the criterion specified in paragraph 7.2.1.

The Expert appointed under paragraph 7.2 shall act on the following basis:

Annex 3 to Schedule A2

Planning of Pre-Committed Resource

INNER CORE TEAM TO 31ST MARCH 2015

The Parties shall agree an Inner Core Team of resources for the period up to 31st March
2015 under the auspices of the Demand Planning Board. The Inner Core Team for such
period shall consist of those Fujitsu Services personnel who have specialist knowledge
and experience of the infrastructure and/or processes used to support Post Office's needs
under the Agreement and whose loss would cause a significant increase in cost or time
for the implementation of future change whilst new staff were trained in or re-discovered
that key knowledge.

The Inner Core Team for the period up to 31st March 2015 is initially set at 9 full time
posts covered by 12 people. Post Office shall have the final say on posts, skill sets and
who is included within the Inner Core Team from the list of candidates recommended by
Fujitsu Services but shall not unreasonably refuse candidates and shall provide reasons
where it reasonably refuses. The Demand Planning Board shall record in its minutes
which areas of the business Fujitsu Services feel is not sufficiently covered to enable
mitigation actions to be taken if necessary.

Limited changes: The Inner Core Team shall be fixed (in terms of variety of skill sets and
numbers of posts and persons) from the date of signature of CCN1271c and such
elements may not be varied prior to 31st March 2015 other than under the process set
out in paragraph 3 below in relation to skill sets only.

The additional provisions regarding the Inner Core Team set out in paragraphs 11 and 12
below shall apply with effect from 1st April 2015 except that paragraph 11 will not apply
in the event that the Inner Core Team is terminated by Post Office pursuant to paragraph
12 below.

OUTER CORE TEAM TO 31st MARCH 2015

The Parties shall agree an Outer Core Team of resources for the period up to 31st
March 2015 under the auspices of the Demand Planning Board. The Outer Core Team
shall consist of those Fujitsu Services personnel who have specialist knowledge and
experience of the infrastructure and/or processes used to support Post Office's needs
under the Agreement and whose loss would cause a significant increase in cost or time
for the implementation of future change whilst new staff were trained in or re-discovered
that key knowledge.

The Outer Core Team for the period up to 31st March 2015 is initially set at 15 full time
posts covered by 18 people. Post Office shall have the final say on posts, skill sets and
who is included within the Outer Core Team from the list of candidates recommended by
Fujitsu Services but shall not unreasonably refuse candidates and shall provide reasons
where it reasonably refuses. The Demand Planning Board shall record in its minutes

Schedule A2 Version 14.0
Page 21 of 27

FUJ00234786
FUJ00234786
CONFIDENTIAL

which areas of the business Fujitsu Services feel are not sufficiently covered to enable
mitigation actions to be taken if necessary.

c) Right to cancel Outer Core Team: Post Office shall have the right to cancel the Outer
Core Team effective from the second anniversary of signature of CCN1271c. Post Office
may exercise such option in writing to the Fujitsu Services Commercial Director up to 21
months from signature of CCN1271c only. If such break option is not activated, the
Outer Core Team shall continue in place as normal until 31st March 2015.

d) Limited Changes: The Outer Core Team shall be fixed (in terms of variety of skill sets
and numbers of posts and persons) from the date of signature of CCN 1271c and such
elements may only be varied:

i) in relation to numbers of persons and posts only, on Post Office giving 9
months' notice after that date. Post Office shall not reduce the numbers of
persons and/or posts of the Outer Core Team as initially set by more than 20%
during the initial 2 years from signature of CCN1271c. During years 3-5 from
signature of CCN1271c, assuming Post Office has not invoked the break option
at point 2(b) above, Post Office may reduce the numbers of persons and/or
posts of the Outer Core Team by up to 20% in total of the size existing at the
second anniversary of signature of CCN1271c during the remainder of the Term
of the Agreement. Should Post Office not have utilised the full 20% reduction
during the initial 2 years, then the remaining balance is not carried over to the
3rd-5th years.

ii) In relation to skill sets only, under the process set out in point 3) below.
3. VARIATIONS TO SKILL SETS OF THE INNER AND OUTER CORE TEAMS:

a) Where forecast utilisation of a specified skill set within either the Inner Core Team or Outer
Core Team is less than 50% for three or more succeeding months, Post Office may request
at the Demand Planning Forum for that skill set to be exchanged for another skill set where
consistent demand is shown. Post Office may, after the first anniversary of signature of
CCN1271c, change 1 person in the Inner Core Team and 2 people within the Outer Core
team under this provision each year.

b) Where the replacement persons are from the Inner Core Team, the Outer Core Team or the
Standing Team, it is expected that Post Office will normally backfill that post, leaving the total
within each team unchanged. Post Office's rights in respect of team size reductions under the
other provisions of CCN1271c would be unaffected.

c) Post Office's entitlement to discounts will be unaffected by exchanges of personnel under this
paragraph.

d) Only in the event that the Post Office has requested the substitution, any re-skilling
requirements for the replacement resource will be chargeable to the Post Office provided that
Fujitsu Services shall take all reasonable endeavours to minimise the need for such re-
skilling.

Services forecasted minimum level of resources required, over and above the Inner Core
Team and the Outer Core Team, to match the minimum Fujitsu Services forecasted
workload anticipated within the next rolling 9 month period. This is initially set at 20.9 full
time posts covered by 23 people. Post Office may terminate individual resource from this
team on 3 months’ notice after completion of the first 9 months. Post Office shall have the

final say on what quantity of personnel for each grade is included within the Standing Team
from the recommended list provided by Fujitsu Services. For replacements, Fujitsu Services
shall recommend its suggested candidate plus at least 1 other qualified candidate and Post

Office may request further candidates where, for good reason, neither of the submitted
candidates is acceptable. Fujitsu Services remains the final arbiter on who fills each post,
as long as they meet the required qualifications and experience.”

1.1.1. the Clauses, Schedules and Annexes to this Agreement and to the Contract
Controlled Documents and Contract Referenced Documents listed in its
Schedules shall only be made; and

1.1.2 documents forming part of or related to Work Orders, where the amendment or
change satisfies the criteria specified in paragraph 5.3 of Schedule A2, may be
made,

in accordance with the Change Control Procedure.

Within the context of the following sections of this Schedule the term "change" includes
both amendments and changes.

Notwithstanding the above, the parties agree that certain changes that relate to the KS
cloud platform will only need to follow the Change Control Procedure where the
circumstances set out within paragraph 2.3 of Schedule I4 are met.

PRINCIPLES

Where Post Office or Fujitsu Services identifies the need for a change, then Post Office
may at any time request a change or Fujitsu Services may at any time recommend a
change. Such a request or recommendation shall only be made and shall only be valid if
authorised (in each case) in accordance with the procedures set out in paragraph 3 of
this Schedule.

Neither Post Office nor Fujitsu Services shall unreasonably withhold or delay their
agreement to any change or proposal in relation thereto.

Until such time as a change has been fully authorised in accordance with the procedures
set out in paragraph 3 of this Schedule, Post Office and Fujitsu Services shall continue
as if the change had not been made.

Any discussions which may take place between Post Office and Fujitsu Services on a
change before its authorisation shall be without prejudice to the rights of either Party.

Any purported change provided by Fujitsu Services that has not been otherwise agreed
in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2.1 above shall be undertaken entirely at
the expense and liability of Fujitsu Services. If so required by Post Office, Fujitsu Services
shall at its own expense promptly take all steps necessary to reverse and remove the
effects of such purported change.

agree that such proposal should be submitted, Fujitsu Services will be relieved of
its obligations to produce such CWO and/or CCN.

CONTRACTING FOR DEVELOPMENT SERVICES

Fujitsu Services and Post Office shall operate a generic development approach (the
“Development Lifecycle”) for Development Services procured by Post Office from Fujitsu
Services under this Schedule B1.1. The Development Lifecycle is made up of six generic
stages (each generic stage being a “Development Lifecycle Stage”) as described in

Development Methodology agreed by the Parties as most suitable for successfully
delivering the development project in question. The Development Methodology to be
used for each development project shall:

4.2.1 be agreed by the Parties no later than the end of the Requirements Stage (as
described in paragraph 5.4.1) +for that development project;

4.2.2 — shall, as a minimum, set out the approach to the Development Lifecycle Stages
(including how the processes and disciplines of the Development Methodology
map to the generic Development Lifecycle and Development Lifecycle Stages)
and the Artefacts to be produced at each Development Lifecycle Stage for that
development project, by each Party; and

4.2.3 shall be developed to be consistent with RMG Harmony (so as not to prevent the
use by Post Office of RMG Harmony in relation to that development project.)

Post Office shall be responsible for documenting the Development Methodology agreed
for each development project.

Development Services to be undertaken by Fujitsu Services must be ordered as Work
Orders in accordance with the provisions of Schedule D2. The terms of such Work
Orders shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs 4 and 5
unless either paragraph 2.2.6 or paragraph 6 applies, in which case the terms of such
Work Orders shall be determined in accordance with paragraph 2.2.6 or 6 respectively.

The basis for development resource planning of Work Packages shall be the
Development Lifecycle Stages.

The following principles shall be applicable to contracting for Development Services
between Post Office and Fujitsu Services:

4.5.1 clear control for each Development Lifecycle Stage and the responsibility to
deliver associated deliverables will be specified and agreed between the Parties
as vesting in either Post Office or Fujitsu Services but not both;

4.5.2 business control of Work Packages shall be established in accordance with the
governance principles set out in Schedule A2 and the Work Ordering Procedure
in Schedule D2 and each large Work Package will have a senior management
sponsor within both Fujitsu Services and Post Office; and

4.5.3 related responsibilities shall be clearly identified and assigned to specific
individuals in Fujitsu Services or Post Office.

Where the scope and size of a Work Package are substantial, Post Office may request
Fujitsu Services to identify as separable components of work individual Work Package
Elements which could be carried out by third parties under Fujitsu Services' management.
Where this option is considered, Fujitsu Services will identify any liability, performance,

reliability or other potential service implications of such option and the terms to be
incorporated into a subcontract for such work.

THE DEVELOPMENT LIFECYCLE

Initial Development Lifecycle Stages

The following Development Lifecycle Stages will be led by Post Office who may procure
professional services (as described in paragraph 3.1.1) from Fujitsu Services to support
the work done in the relevant Development Lifecycle Stage.

5.1.1. Strategic Approval Stage, which defines the strategic and architectural
framework within which the changes are to be developed and delivered.

5.1.2 Start-up and Feasibility Stage, in which Post Office develops an outline view of a
potential business requirement with input, where required, from Fujitsu Services:

5.1.2.1 on the indicative cost range for the provision of a potential solution, to
assist Post Office in making an informed decision on:

(a) the business case for proceeding to later stages of the
Development Lifecycle; and

(b) sourcing of solution components; and

5.1.2.2 to assist with an assessment of the most appropriate Development
Methodology to be adopted (with this Development Methodology being
confirmed during the Requirements Stage by the Systems Integration
Partnership); and

5.1.2.3 to give an indication of the scope of any work that Fujitsu Services
proposes be undertaken by any Sub-contractor located outside the
United Kingdom (with this being confirmed during the Solution Definition
Stage).

A key objective of these two Development Lifecycle Stages is to provide sufficient
information to Post Office such that it can make an informed decision about the
procurement approach in respect of the development project as a whole and each
solution component. Post Office shall consider the procurement options by reference to
the provisions of Schedule B1.3 and paragraphs 4.6 and 6 of this Schedule B1.1 before a
decision is made by Post Office on whether it will involve Fujitsu Services in the later
Development Lifecycle Stages or in procuring subcontractors in accordance with
paragraph 4.6, or adopt a competitive approach in accordance with paragraph 6.

Subsequent Development Lifecycle Stages where Development Services are procured
from Fujitsu Services

If Fujitsu Services is required to provide Development Services after the Strategic
Approval Stage and the Start-up and Feasibility Stage and a competitive approach is not
adopted by Post Office as described in paragraph 6 of this Schedule B1.1, the remaining
provisions of this paragraph 5 shall be applicable.

The Development Lifecycle Stages that (subject to paragraphs 4.2 and 5.5) shall apply
after the Strategic Approval Stage and the Start-up and Feasibility Stage are described
below.

5.4.1 Requirements Stage, in which production of a full specification of the
requirements and Work Packages is led and managed by Post Office to form the
basis for solution specification and any subsequent contract for development,
implementation, acceptance and operational work.

5.4.2 Solution Definition Stage, managed by Fujitsu Services, in which Fujitsu Services
produces (i) a solution description as defined in the applicable Development
Methodology setting out the proposed solution in response to the Post Office's
Work Package requirements including any qualifications and caveats applicable
to those requirements and (ii) Change Work Orders detailing the price and
contractual terms applicable to the subsequent Development Lifecycle Stages
(and those applicable to any subsequent stage relating to operational service if
not dealt with in an associated CCN), including confirmation of the details and
scope of any work to be undertaken by any Sub-contractor located outside the
United Kingdom (together with the identity of any such Sub-contractor).

5.4.3 Solution Build and Test Stage, managed by Fujitsu Services, in which Fujitsu
Services undertakes the development, integration and testing of the solution
Work Package (other than any user testing or release validation testing or
elements of solution assurance which will be managed by Post Office) up to, and
including, its acceptance by Post Office.

5.4.4 Implementation Stage, managed by Fujitsu Services, in which Fujitsu Services
undertakes system and software rollout into the live environment (any necessary
Implementation of Branch Hardware having been carried out in accordance with
Schedule B1.3 and, as applicable, this Schedule) together with related planning
and change management, up to acceptance of the solution into live service. Post
Office related business implementation aspects shall be managed by Post Office.

In order to optimise the Development Lifecycle, Development Lifecycle Stages may
overlap or occur in parallel, be combined or, in exceptional cases, omitted. The method of
operation of the Development Lifecycle Stages for each development project will be set
out in the Development Methodology as agreed and documented in accordance with
paragraph 4.2.

Office to consider such proposals and shall seek Post Office agreement to these
proposals before they are implemented, such agreement not to be unreasonably
withheld. The decision to offshore the development of a component will be based on
information that will include architectural considerations, skills availability, development
knowledge, support constraints and security measures.

Before Fujitsu Services proposes to Post Office, pursuant to paragraph 5.13, that any
development work be undertaken offshore, Fujitsu Services shall, at no cost to the Post
Office, carry out an assessment of the potential risks involved in such work being
undertaken offshore. Such assessment shall consider any potential risks arising from the

from other areas and other networks including data security, network security,
server security, document security and web security; then

as part of any such agreement, the Parties shall also agree any additional charges to be
paid by Post Office for those measures, such charges to reflect any additional costs
incurred by the offshore developer in implementing those measures.

Fujitsu Services shall be responsible for ensuring that the offshore developer implements
and observes any security measures disclosed to Post Office pursuant to paragraph
15.13 (to the extent they are relevant to the offshore developer) or agreed by the Parties
pursuant to paragraph 5.16. Other than as referred to in paragraph 5.16, the cost of such
security measures shall be borne by Fujitsu Services.

COMPETITIVE APPROACH

Having undertaken the Strategic Approval Stage and the Start-up and Feasibility Stage,
Post Office may decide to adopt a competitive approach for the development project in
which case the terms on which any subsequent Development Services are provided by
Fujitsu Services in relation to that development project will be determined through a
competitive process. Post Office shall specify the requirements and processes to be

applied to such competitive procurement, dividing the tasks into Work Packages which
may replicate the Development Lifecycle Stages.

If Post Office decides to adopt a competitive approach, the following provisions shall
apply:

6.2.1 If paragraph 2.1.2 applies in respect of a Work Package, Post Office shall procure
that Work Package from Fujitsu Services.

6.2.2 If Fujitsu Services has been appointed as the Preferred Systems Integrator and a
Work Package involves Systems Integration then, unless paragraph 2.1.2 applies,
Fujitsu Services shall be invited to compete for that Work Package in accordance
with paragraph 3.6 of Schedule A1.

6.2.3 In all other cases, Fujitsu Services shall not unreasonably be refused by Post
Office an opportunity to compete for any of the Work Packages.

All Work Packages awarded to Fujitsu Services as part of the competitive process
envisaged by this paragraph shall be procured by Work Order agreed under the Work
Ordering Procedure. Unless the Parties agree otherwise, the provisions of paragraph 5.6
to 5.12 shall apply in relation to such Work Orders.

Post Office shall, with assistance from Fujitsu Services in relation to Work Packages
awarded to Fujitsu Services, plan the stages involved in development work in order to
achieve appropriate time to market that may involve overlapping stages between Post
Office and its suppliers, including Fujitsu Services. However there shall be discrete
decision points such that Fujitsu Services shall be aware whether work undertaken by it in
one stage shall be followed by a competitive procurement in relation to the next stage.

Post Office may procure from Fujitsu Services the establishment of a test environment for
use by a third party developer, where required, as a specific Work Order at the rates and
charges set out in paragraph 10 of Schedule D1.

BRANCH HARDWARE IMPLEMENTATION SERVICES
DEFINITIONS

In this Schedule B1.3 the term Branch shall have the same meaning as set out in
Schedule’ (Interpretation), save that where Implementation activities occur in respect of
other premises such as, without limitation, CTOs, the term Branch in this Schedule B1.3
shall, in respect of such Implementations, be read to include such premises.

INTRODUCTION

This Schedule B1.3 sets out provisions and governing principles regarding the
Implementation of Branch Hardware and Stand-Alone Hardware.

HARDWARE IMPACT ASSESSMENT

Where Post Office wishes to carry out the Implementation of Branch Hardware it shall
procure a Hardware Impact Assessment from Fujitsu Services.

Where Post Office wishes to carry out the Implementation of Stand-Alone Hardware it
may procure a Hardware Impact Assessment from Fujitsu Services.

Where Hardware Impact Assessments for Branch Hardware or Stand-Alone Hardware
are procured in accordance with paragraphs 3.1 or 3.2 of Schedule B1.3, such
Hardware Impact Assessments shall be carried out by the Parties jointly.

IMPLEMENTATION OF BRANCH HARDWARE AND STAND-ALONE HARDWARE

Where following Hardware Impact Assessment Post Office decides to proceed with
Implementation and procure the applicable Branch Hardware or Stand-Alone Hardware
Post Office shall either:

4.1.1 procure the entire Implementation (other than elements specifically reserved to
Post Office) from Fujitsu Services; or

4.1.2 procure certain of those elements of the Implementation from Fujitsu Services
and either carry out the remaining elements itself or contract with third parties to
do so.

The table set out in the Annex to this Schedule sets out a non-exhaustive list of those
elements of the Implementation of Branch Hardware or Stand-Alone Hardware which
may be carried out by Post Office, Fujitsu Services and third parties.

Where Fujitsu Services is intended to carry out the whole, or any element, of the
Implementation of Branch Hardware (including a Hardware Impact Assessment and
related planning activities) the Work Ordering Procedure shall be used for the relevant
Work Package Elements and the provisions of paragraph 5 of this Schedule shall apply

to such Implementation in addition to the Change Work Order agreed as part of the
relevant Work Order. In the event of any conflict between such Change Work Order
and the provisions of this Schedule, the Change Work Order shall prevail.

Where Fujitsu Services is intended to carry out the whole, or any element, of the
Implementation of Stand-Alone Hardware, the Work Ordering Procedure shall apply and
the provisions of paragraph 5 shall apply as though references to “Branch Hardware”
were to "Stand-Alone Hardware".

Where any third party carries out the whole, or any element, of the Implementation of
Branch Hardware or Stand-Alone Hardware, the provisions of paragraph 6 of this
Schedule shall apply to such Implementation.

PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO ELEMENTS OF IMPLEMENTATION PROVIDED BY
FUJITSU SERVICES

Charges
Fujitsu Services’ prices for Implementation, or any element of Implementation, shall be

based, unless otherwise agreed by the Parties, on the principles set out in paragraph
13.4 of Schedule D1.

Liability, Risk And Title

Where Fujitsu Services (or its chosen third party supplier) carries out Installation it shall
be liable for any damage to:

5.2.1 physical property (including, for the avoidance of doubt, damage to the
Infrastructure) together with any reasonable costs incurred by Post Office in
repairing such damage (including the cost of work involved); and

5.2.2 data (in which case Fujitsu Services is responsible for retrieving such data),

which occurs at a Branch as a direct result of such Installation work.

Non-technical support

access to Branches).

PROVISIONS APPLICABLE WHERE ELEMENTS OF IMPLEMENTATION PROVIDED
BY POST OFFICE OR A THIRD PARTY

Commercial/Contractual Relationship

The commercial/contractual relationship between Post Office, Fujitsu Services and any
third party supplier, including the charges payable to Fujitsu Services by Post Office,
shall be agreed on a case by case basis for each Implementation. The parties may
adopt whatever commercial/contractual structure is appropriate for the particular

circumstances. However, the commercial/contractual arrangement must take into
account the impact on the systems and services provided to Post Office by Fujitsu
Services. Fujitsu Services shall not unreasonably refuse to accept proposed
commercial/contractual terms for the Implementation of Branch Hardware or Stand-
Alone Hardware. Fujitsu Services may base its decision to reject proposed terms on
commercial and/or an adverse outcome of Hardware Impact Assessment.

Branch Hardware Procurement

Until 318 March 2015, where Post Office procures Branch Hardware from a third party,
a warranty clause (the terms of which shall be agreed with Fujitsu Services, such
agreement not to be unreasonably withheld) must form part of the purchase agreement
for the Branch Hardware between the Post Office and the third party. Until 31st March
2015, prior to physical transfer of the Branch Hardware to Fujitsu Services or
incorporation of the Branch Hardware into the Infrastructure (whichever is earlier) Post
Office shall use reasonable endeavours to transfer to Fujitsu Services the benefit of and
right to the third party warranty provisions.

Installation

6.3.1 Fujitsu Services shall not unreasonably refuse to give Post Office, or its
designated supplier, the authority to disconnect and reconnect elements of the
Infrastructure at Branches as part of an Installation.

6.3.2 Where Post Office (or its chosen third party supplier) carries out Installation it
shall be liable for any damage to physical property or data which occurs at a
Branch (including, for the avoidance of doubt, damage to the Infrastructure) as
a direct result of such Installation work.

6.3.3 Notwithstanding paragraph 6.3.2, where Post Office or its third party supplier
carries out Installation work, Fujitsu Services shall be liable for any damage to
the Infrastructure or data in accordance with paragraph 5.2 where:

6.3.3.1 such damage occurred as a result of the Post Office or its chosen third
party supplier carrying out such Installation work in accordance with

installation specifications provided by Fujitsu Services;

6.3.3.2 the damage would not have occurred if the Fujitsu Services installation
specifications had not been followed; and

6.3.3.3 Post Office or its third party supplier acted in the manner of a
reasonable and skilled provider of Installation services in following the
installation specifications.

Service Levels

Fujitsu Services shall be granted relief from any applicable Service Levels:

3.11.8

The Training Support Facility supports training from CTOs enabling each CTO
Counter within a CTO to operate an independent training environment.

The Training Support Facility utilises those aspects of the Business Capabilities
and Support Facilities that provide Branch based capability together with
separate functionality to simulate online interfaces which will return pre-defined
simulation responses.

Users of the Training Support Facility will generate Training Transactions and
Training Data that will be separated and separately identifiable from HNG-X
Transactions and data. Training Data will not be passed to external clients or the
audit stream.

Reports generated using the Training Support Facility will reflect the Training
Transactions performed during the Training Session and stock levels reported will
be adjusted accordingly.

Post Office will establish and manage each CTO Branch as a Branch within the
live estate and each will be allocated their own Branch Code which will indicate
that they are a CTO Branch.

The Training Support Facility will utilise Branch Infrastructure and will require the
use of an operational data communications link in order to process Training
Transactions. Each CTO Counter within a CTO will be connected by LAN through
the shared single branch router, and there will be a shared back office printer.

The Training Support Facility will enable the Training Data of a CTO Counter to
be reset back to a pre-defined default state.

The Training Support Facility will require the use of an operational data
communications link in order that updates of software change and reference data
can occur. This may take place automatically in the same manner as for Branches
or at points in time that are agreed between Fujitsu Services and Post Office.

3.3.1

Data Centre Resilience

(a)

(d)

One Data Centre will be used to support the Business Capabilities and
Support Facilities (the “Live Data Centre”) with a second Data Centre
providing DR (the “DR Data Centre”). There are network components
(appliances and platforms) at the DR Data Centre which contribute to
the provision of Business Capabilities and Support Facilities.

The DR Data Centre will under normal operation be used for testing
except where it needs to be used for business continuity tests. The DR
Data Centre will also host some live network components.

Each Data Centre shall have the capability in normal operation with no
failures or a single failure having occurred:

(i) to support the Contracted Volumes as defined in the CCD
entitled "Horizon Capacity Management and Business Volumes”
(PA/PER/033); and

(ii) to support Fujitsu Services’ obligations in respect of Service
Levels set out in Schedule C1 and each applicable Service
Description.

Each Data Centre will be configured such that the failure of a single
component will not cause the Business Capabilities and Support
Facilities to fail. For the avoidance of doubt, Fujitsu Services will inform
Post Office of those major Data Centre components whose failure may
result in the need to invoke DR. There is a single high capacity WAN
circuit into each Data Centre. Should the link into one Data Centre fail
then a patch via the other Data Centre will be used.

Switchover to backup systems within the Data Centre and for the
network connections within the Data Centre:

(i) for real-time elements of the Business Capabilities and Support
Facilities shall be automated; and

(ii) for non-real time elements may be automated or manual.

Switchover from the Live Data Centre to the DR Data Centre will be
manually initiated.

In the event that the DR Data Centre needs to be used to run the live
service or if the DR Data Centre itself is unavailable, there will be no
significant test environment available. In this scenario, limited testing
(sufficient to test minor fixes needed to keep the live service operational)
will be available at a Fujitsu Services development site. However such
testing facilities will not be sufficient to test releases.

or

(ili) convert leased line communications from Branches into internet
protocol (IP) communications

(iv) convert wireless wide area network (WAN) protocols from
Branches into internet protocol (IP) communications,

(the "Central Network").

The loss of a major sub-contractor network switching node within the
Central Network shall not cause the complete loss of the Branch
Telecom Infrastructure. However, should a loss of a major sub-
contractor network switching node within the Central Network occur,
Fujitsu Services (in addition to its other obligations under this
Agreement) shall use all reasonable endeavours to procure that any
shortfall in system performance is recovered within seven days of that
loss.

The Central Network shall be configured such that there shall be no
single point of failure within the Central Network. Some failures in the
Central Network may require the Branch to re-establish communications
with the Data Centre.

3.3.3 The Santander Circuit

(a)

The Santander Circuit shall be configured such that there shall be no
single point of failure (including site failure) within the Santander Circuit.

"The Santander Circuit shall have the capability in normal operation, with
no failures or a single failure having occurred to that link:”

2. ESCHER UPGRADE SOFTWARE

21 General

2.1.1

This paragraph 2 specifies the terms on which the Escher Upgrade Software may
be used by Post Office and Escher Software Users in connection with the Existing
Services. Such rights of use shall cease upon the occurrence of Trigger Point T6
(Counter Application Rollout Complete).

2.2 Terms of Use

2.2.1

2.2.2

2.2.3

Fujitsu Services grants to Post Office and to all Escher Software Users from time
to time (together with Post Office the “Licensed Persons”) a right to use and (for
the purposes only of loading, execution, storage, transmission or display) copy
the Escher Upgrade Software to the extent necessary for the Licensed Persons
to receive the Existing Services in connection with the system known as “Horizon”
currently in use by Post Office and as upgraded by the Escher Upgrade Software.

Fujitsu Services warrants that it has the right to grant the rights stated to be
granted by it under paragraph 2 of this Schedule B4.1 and that it has the right to
make such back-up copies of the Escher Upgrade Software as are reasonably
necessary for the provision of the Services.

The rights granted by paragraph 2.2.1 of this Schedule B4.1 are subject to the
following conditions:

2.2.3.1 Post Office shall notify Fujitsu Services of all actual or threatened
breaches of Escher’s trade secret, patent, copyright, and other ownership
rights in the Escher Upgrade Software of which it becomes aware and
shall use reasonable endeavours to provide Fujitsu Services with
assistance as may be reasonably requested by Fujitsu Services in
relation to the prevention and/or challenge of such actual or threatened
breaches.

2.2.3.2 Notwithstanding paragraph 2.2.3.1 of this Schedule B4.1, Post Office
may at its absolute discretion notify Escher directly of such actual or
threatened breach in addition to notifying Fujitsu Services.

2.2.3.3

2.2.3.4

2.2.3.5

2.2.3.6

All use of the Escher Upgrade Software by Post Office and/or Escher
Software Users shall take place within the United Kingdom or its
territories.

On termination of this Agreement, provided such termination occurs prior
to Trigger Point T6 (Counter Application Rollout Complete), Fujitsu
Services shall at Post Office's request procure the direct licence of the
Escher Upgrade Software to either Post Office or a replacement for
Fujitsu Services appointed by Post Office (as Post Office requests) at no
charge and on substantially the same terms as the Existing Licences.
The obligations of Fujitsu Services and the rights of Post Office under this
paragraph 2.2.3.4 shall survive termination of this Agreement.

Post Office's rights granted by Fujitsu Services by paragraph 2.2.1 of this
Schedule B4.1 shall terminate upon the grant of a direct licence in
accordance with paragraph 2.2.3.4 of this Schedule B4.1.

Save to the extent required under English law, the rights granted by
paragraph 2.2.1 of this Schedule B4.1 shall not be construed so as to
allow Post Office to modify, reverse engineer, disassemble or reverse
compile the Escher Upgrade Software or take any other action to disclose
Escher's source code. To the extent that Post Office is permitted by law
to take such action for interoperability or otherwise, such reverse
engineering or related activity shall be limited to the minimum amount
required and may not be undertaken unless Fujitsu Services has refused
or is unable to make or procure such adaptations after Post Office
requests that it do so. Fujitsu Services shall be entitled, subject to the
prior approval of Post Office, to charge Post Office its reasonable costs
for making and/or procuring such adaptations as Fujitsu Services makes
or procures and Post Office shall pay such charges.

23 Intellectual property rights

Post Office and Fujitsu Services each agree that Escher’s copyright legend shall be
displayed on all software and associated documentation and media under their respective
control in a manner consistent with the CCD entitled “HNGX-U/ Style Guide”

SCHEDULE B6.1

HNG-X BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS

1. INTRODUCTION

14 This Schedule B6.1 sets out the HNG-X Requirements (or processes to be followed to
create HNG-X Requirements) for the HNG-X System, the solution to which will be
developed and documented in accordance with Schedule B6.2.

1.2 This Schedule B6.1 also envisages that the Parties may introduce changes to the live
Horizon system and that such changes may or may not impact on the Requirements
Definition Process.

2. THE THREE BASELINES

21 There are three baselines relevant to the definition of HNG-X Requirements and their
realisation in the development of the HNG-X System:

2.1.1. the “Applicable Horizon Baseline”: the baseline that consists of the Horizon
Applications and the Horizon Service Infrastructure up to and including Release
S92 together with those changes delivered (or to be delivered) after Release S92
which have been agreed in accordance with the Change Control Procedure and
which are, as at the date of signature of CCN1200, listed in Annex 13 to this
Schedule (as that baseline may be amended in accordance with the provisions of
this Schedule);

2.1.2 the “Requirements Baseline”: the baseline described more fully in paragraph 4
that represents Post Office's requirements for the HNG-X System as set out in
this Schedule and agreed in accordance with the Requirements Definition
Process (as that baseline may be amended or re-issued in accordance with the
provisions of this Schedule); and

2.1.3 the “Solution Baseline": the baseline that consists of the HNG-X System as at
the HNG-X Initial Acceptance Date (as that HNG-X System may be modified to
rectify any HNG-X Acceptance Incidents).

2.2 For the purpose of the Parties resolving any dispute concerning the Applicable Horizon
Baseline or any part of the Applicable Horizon Baseline (including, without limitation, a
dispute as to the Existing Functionality), the Parties shall refer to the Horizon system that

the Applicable Horizon Baseline.

Changes to the live Horizon system that are requested after the date of signature of
CCN1200 and that are intended to introduce changes or functions that will be replicated
in, or otherwise affect, the HNG-X System, will be dealt with in accordance with the
Change Control Procedure or through Work Orders. The Change Control Procedure or
the Work Ordering Procedure (as the case may be) will be used to assess the effect of
the changes or new functions on the live Horizon system and (so far as possible at the
time of agreeing the change) on the Requirements Baseline and the changes and new
functions will be taken into account in determining the Applicable Horizon Baseline (and
will be recorded by the Parties in a control log initially formed from the information in
Annex 13 to this Schedule).

THE REQUIREMENTS BASELINE
Requirements Areas

4.1.1 The Requirements Baseline will be composed of HNG-X Requirements covering
each of the following:

(a) the Functional Requirements;

(b) ‘System Capacity and Performance Requirements’ which, as at the date
of signature of CCN1200, are referred to in Annex 3 to this Schedule;

(c) ‘User Interface Requirements’ as described in paragraph 4.3;

(d) ‘Training Requirements’ which, as at the date of signature of CCN1200,
are referred to in Annex 4 to this Schedule;

(e) ‘Operational and Support Service Requirements’ which, as at the date
of signature of CCN1200, are referred to in Annex 5 to this Schedule;

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement (including this Schedule),
where any HNG-X Requirement set out or referred to in Annexes 3 to 10 of this
Schedule is inconsistent with an HNG-X Assumption which is (a) related to that
HNG-X Requirement and (b) set out or referred to in the same Annex or in Annex
12, the HNG-X Assumption shall prevail only to the extent of that inconsistency
such that the HNG-X Requirement shall be modified so as to avoid that
inconsistency (such modification to be dealt with under the HNG-X Programme
Requirements Change Control Process).

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement (including this Schedule),
where the application of the Requirements Definition Process or the application
of the Business Equivalence Principles would produce an HNG-X Requirement
that is inconsistent with the HNG-X Assumption set out in Annex 12, the HNG-X
Assumption shall prevail only to the extent of that inconsistency such that the
HNG-X Requirement shall be modified so as to avoid that inconsistency (such
modification to be dealt with under the HNG-X Programme Requirements Change
Control Process).

HNG-X Requirements will be maintained in the HNG-X Requirements Catalogue
and issued formally to Fujitsu Services at agreed points throughout Project HNG-
X, including at the date of signature of CCN1200, at the end of the Requirements
Stage, and at the end of either or both of HNG-X Requirements Assurance and
HNG-X Solution Assurance (if these result in amendments to the HNG-X
Requirements).

42 Functional Requirements

4.2.4

4.2.2

The Functional Requirements will be generated by following the Functional
Requirements Definition Process. When generating the Functional Requirements
in accordance with the Functional Requirements Definition Process, the Parties
shall at all times observe and apply the following principles ("Business
Equivalence Principles"):

(a) other than the Agreed Changes and the Allowed Changes, the Business
Capabilities and Support Facilities will provide such functionality as
results from applying the guidelines in Annex 1 to the Existing
Functionality; and

(b) for the avoidance of doubt, other than the Agreed Changes and the
Allowed Changes, the Business Capabilities and Support Facilities will
not be required to provide any functionality that does not result from
applying the guidelines in Annex 1 to the Existing Functionality.

Agreed Changes

(a) The Agreed Changes are agreed as exclusions from, additions to, and
changes in the Existing Functionality that are to be applied in generating
the Functional Requirements in accordance with the Functional
Requirements Definition Process. Agreed Changes are exceptions to

Schedule B6.1 Version 14.0

4.2.3

(b)

the Business Equivalence Principles and cannot themselves be
changed by the application of the Business Equivalence Principles.

Any specific functional characteristics of Existing Functionality that have
been changed as a direct consequence of applying an Agreed Change
are no longer subject to the Business Equivalence Principles.

The effect that an Agreed Change has on the Existing Functionality shall
be limited to the direct consequence of applying that Agreed Change to
the relevant aspect or aspects of the Existing Functionality.

One of the Agreed Changes is the introduction of Postal Services. The
Parties will develop HNG-X Requirements for Postal Services in
accordance with the Postal Services Definition Process.

Allowed Changes

The “Allowed Changes" are changes to aspects of Existing Functionality in
respect of which the following conditions are fulfilled:

(a)

(c)

(e)

either:

(i) the aspect of the Existing Functionality is now assessed by Post
Office as creating operational or procedural problems or
inefficiencies within a Branch; or

(ii) the aspect of the Existing Functionality was previously agreed to
be implemented within certain limitations or constraints and these
limitations or constraints are not present in, or relevant to, the
Solution Architecture or other solution artefact; and

the effect of applying the requested change is assessed by Fujitsu
Services, acting reasonably and in good faith, as having an acceptable
cost / risk / resources impact on Project HNG-X; and

the effect of any such change is to make the manner in which Users
utilise an element of Existing Functionality more efficient without
introducing any completely new functionality into the Existing
Functionality; and

the required change is notified in writing by Post Office to Fujitsu
Services before the end of the Requirements Stage or as part of HNG-

X Requirements Assurance; and

the change has not already been assessed as being an Agreed Change.

An Allowed Change shall be dealt with in accordance with the HNG-X Programme
Requirements Change Control Process.

4.3 Requirements of the HNG-X User Interface

4.3.1

4.3.2

4.3.3

4.3.4

The HNG-X Requirements that the HNG-X User Interface shall support are:
(a) the Functional Requirements; and
(b) the non-functional HNG-X Requirements for the HNG-X User Interface.

The functionality required to be supported by the HNG-X User Interface will be
derived from the Functional Requirements generated through the Requirements
Definition Process. This derived functionality will be an input to the process set
out in the CCD entitled "Establishing and Assuring the HNG-X User Interface"
(REQ/GEN/PRD/0001).

The non-functional HNG-X Requirements for the HNG-X User Interface will be
provided by Post Office after the date of signature of CCN1200 in accordance
with the CCD entitled “Establishing and Assuring the HNG-X User Interface”
(REQ/GEN/PRD/0001).

The HNG-X User Interface design will draw on best practice design from the retail
and banking industries as well as industry standards in graphical user interface
design. The Parties intend that any similarities between the style and graphical
realisation of the HNG-X User Interface and the user interface(s) of the
comparable Horizon Applications as may arise shall only arise as a matter of
coincidence through the proper operation of the Clean Room Rules.

5. REQUIREMENTS DEFINITION PROCESS

The Parties will follow the Requirements Definition Process.

6. DEALING WITH CHANGE

6.3.1

Ifa change to the Solution Baseline is notified in writing to Fujitsu Services within
the period of three months after the start of HNG-X Project Workstream X4 (HNG-
X Application Rollout) then, if that change is:

(a) not the result of the User Interface Definition Process nor the Postal
Services Definition Process, and required in order to correct a deviation
of the Solution Baseline from the Business Equivalence Principles; or

(b) the result of the Postal Services Definition Process and required in order
to correct a deviation of the Solution Baseline from the Postal Services
Assessment Guidelines,

the Parties will meet to agree whether the conditions in paragraph 6.3.1(a) or (b)
have been fulfilled, and if such conditions have been fulfilled:

(c) discuss and agree in good faith the steps required to correct a deviation
of the Solution Baseline from the Business Equivalence Principles or the
Postal Services Assessment Guidelines (as the case may be); or

(d) determine such other remedial steps as the Parties (acting reasonably)
shall agree; and

the financial outcome resulting from the operation of a specific Transaction for the
Customer, Post Office, any affected Client(s), and any Other IT Supplier(s) is
identical to the equivalent Transaction carried out using the Existing Functionality;

the Post Office products that can be traded within a Branch are the same as those
defined in Post Office Reference Data (whether enabled or not) using the Existing
Functionality;

the Business Rules associated with any Business Capability are applied in the
same manner as those used with the equivalent Transaction carried out using the
Existing Functionality;

the Customer and Counter Clerk interactions that relate to the workflow
associated with a particular Use Case and delivered via the HNG-X User Interface
enable:

2.4.1 the same data to be captured using the same format and validation
criteria;

2.4.2 the same initiating Tokens and/or equivalent initiating events to be used;

2.4.3 equivalent information displays and capture methods via the counter
terminal; and

2.4.4 the same set of user tasks to be performed following an equivalent
logical workflow and enabling the same or, where agreed, alternative
equivalent operational procedures to be carried out,

in each case as compared with the Existing Functionality;

the outputs resulting from the completion of a Transaction are the same or
equivalent and have the same operational effect (in terms of form and occurrence)
as those resulting from the associated Transaction conducted using the Existing
Functionality. The types of outputs shall include:

2.5.1 any information exchange or generated data file which includes
interactions with hosted systems (e.g. PAF, POL-FS) and external

any printed item (e.g. Report, Branch receipt, other forms of Branch
produced collateral), which shall be equivalent to the Existing
Functionality; and

any data, produced or captured, that can be accessed, retrieved by, or
provided to, the Post Office, which shall be the same as that from the
Existing Functionality, provided that the meaning of the data and/or
associated Post Office processes has not changed as a result of the
introduction of the HNG-X System. This will be bounded by the scope of
any specific limitations agreed as part of the HNG-X Services;

the outcome of any aspect of Branch trading or operation results in the same state
of financial integrity and ability to audit as exists using the Existing Functionality;

the use and interpretation of Post Office Reference Data (in terms of its data
definitions and its use to invoke functionality) will remain the same. Any data
items or Reference Data capabilities currently unused within the Existing
Functionality will remain unused or suppressed as part of the HNG-X System
subject to agreement of Post Office; and

Users must be able to perceive and perform the functions provided via the
changed User Interface such that they can perform the same user tasks,
performing equivalent human and computer interactions.

1 Session Transfer A facility that enables a Branch User to log-on at another counter

without having to log-off at their previous counter. This facility
will automatically log-out the Branch User at their previous
counter and move any current activity onto their new counter.
This facility is also known as “Session Mobility” or “Session
Migration”. This facility is not available during certain operations.

2 I Session Suspend A facility that enables a Branch User to ‘Suspend’ and
subsequently ‘Resume’ a desktop session. Only one session
can be suspended in this way. During the suspension the
Branch User is presented with a new main desktop menu and
may carry out any of the system functions (including serving
another customer) while the original session is suspended.
Each of the two sessions (the suspended and the current) can
be ‘toggled’ by selection of the ‘suspend/swap' button. The two
sessions will remain in existence until the user returns one of
the sessions to the ‘Desk Top’ and then swaps to the other
session. This facility is not available during certain operations.

Description

1 Report simplifications

Report consolidation for the HNG-X System
will be achieved through decoupling the call
for data about reports from the central
database, from the user production and
analysis of reports. Reports will be grouped
into a small number of categories, such as
“Counter Daily Report” and “Counter Weekly
Report”. A revised counter sequence will be
design to enable the user to work through the
report set, printing and cutting off as
appropriate.

Post Office confirms that this does not have an
adverse impact on branches as the process is

similar to present and it also provides a way

Description

for single counter position branches to be able
to exit to continue customer service if required.

Any consolidation and/or rationalisation of
reports on top of this solution would not
necessarily impact the load on the database
from report production as those reports will be
contained within the bundles of data called in
the one data call. However, it is recognised
that it would be good practice for Post Office
to consolidate and rationalise reports anyway
as a house-keeping exercise to improve
efficiency at the counter and reduce
consumables. This exercise will be carried out
in conjunction with the analysis of the
functional requirements. The Fujitsu Services
baseline assumption for contract is that the
following reports will be removed:

e Counter Daily
o APS Transaction Listing
o O/L Balance Enquiries
o O/L Cash Deposits
o O/L Cheque Deposits

o O/L Cash Withdrawals
(signature and PIN)

2 Changes to the session settlement The HNG-X session settlement model will
model

change from Horizon as a consequence of the
on-line architecture, the classification of
transactions as either 'Recoverable’ or
'Cancellable', and changes to the production
of some receipt printing.

The primary areas of difference are: -

¢ Transactions will be classed as either
‘Recoverable' or 'Cancellable’;

e the settlement process is now an on-
line dialogue supported by some new
Counter Clerk dialogues;

e certain receipts will now be printed
during the settlement process,
completing after session data is
secured at the Data Centre;

* a new settlement transaction
sequence will handle transient time-
outs to the Data Centre. This will
comprise automatic retries and then
Counter Clerk managed dialogues
supporting ‘Retry’ and = ‘Cancel’
options;

* certain failure conditions will result in
the settlement process having to be
cancelled. New Counter Clerk
dialogues will manage this exception
process with respect to the settlement
of the 'Recoverable’ transactions and
the cancellation of the 'Cancellable'
transactions. A variant of the
Customer Session receipt for session
recovery will be produced. Following
the printing of the revised session
receipts, the Counter Clerk will be
logged off; and

e a new recovery process will be
initiated on subsequent log-on to the
original terminal. New Counter Clerk
dialogues will manage this recovery
process with respect to the final

Transaction Enquiry Service will not receive
C2 messages in near real time, and
Streamline payment file(s) will only be

7 PIN Pad required for Banking
Deposits

To protect against replay attacks, banking
deposit transactions will use a MAC generated
by the PIN Pad. This will require the presence
of a PIN Pad (a change from Horizon). For the
avoidance of doubt, this will not require a PIN
to be entered by the customer.

8 Change to End of Day

Branch end of day will be declared for all
branches at 19:00 each day. This will be the
same time for all Branches (i.e. there will be

4. The Business Equivalence Principles do not apply to the System Capacity and
Performance Requirements or associated Service Levels, but it is accepted that the
performance characteristics of the HNG-X System counter applications and associated
infrastructure must be acceptable to the Post Office. This specific aspect of the Solution
Baseline will be assessed to determine that the HNG-X System counter performance
delivers equivalent or better performance characteristics to the Applicable Horizon
Baseline, based on the following principles:

44 Post Office and Fujitsu Services will jointly agree an assessment process that will:

(a) define and agree sets of representative Transaction types and a
measurement period;

(b) establish system component benchmark measurements for these
Transaction types on the Horizon system and on the HNG-X System
(taking account of any changed processes or UI characteristics that may
be present in the HNG-X Transaction); and

(c) allow Post Office to request that the set of Transaction types is
augmented (agreement to such requests not to be unreasonably
withheld by Fujitsu Services) if anomalous HNG-X Transaction
performance characteristics are identified prior to the commencement of
the HNG-X Project Workstream X4 (HNG-X Application Rollout).

42 Acceptance by Post Office of the HNG-X System counter performance will be
based on the average system component benchmark measurements for each of
the agreed sets of representative Transaction types for the HNG-X System being
no worse than the comparable measurements for each of the Transaction types

ANNEX 14
REQUIREMENTS DEFINITION PROCESS,
PART 1 — FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS DEFINITION PROCESS
INTRODUCTION AND SCOPE

Project HNG-X will commence with the Requirements Stage, which includes specification
and assurance activities, and which will be directed by the Requirements Definition
Process.

Part 1 of this Annex 11 is concerned with the definition and assurance processes to
establish a baseline of Functional Requirements.

This process will focus on the specification of the business process and data requirements
of the Business Capabilities and Support Facilities. Any of the existing non-functional
HNG-X Requirements that relate to specific requirements, artefacts or capabilities will
also be applied at this stage.

HNG-X Requirements Assurance will be conducted as a joint activity comprising both
business content assurance and the inclusion of any agreed optimisation or improvement
opportunities that would facilitate solution design. Both these aspects of HNG-X
Requirements Assurance will involve Fujitsu Services and will occur progressively and
prior to the final issuing to Fujitsu Services of the Functional Requirements.

PRINCIPLES

The principles that will apply during the definition and assurance process, in particular
concerning the interchange of HNG-X Requirements artefacts between Post Office and
Fujitsu Services are as follows:

24 DOORS (as configured within Post Office for Project HNG-X) is the master
repository of all HNG-X Requirements;

2.2 the intention is to be able to compartmentalise the HNG-X Requirements so that
each group of HNG-X Requirements has its own life and own versioning;

2.3 functional Use Cases will be grouped into convenient business areas which will
be made available to Fujitsu Services at relevant points to enable early visibility
and a more interactive approach to solution design; and

24 to ensure integrity of the HNG-X Requirements as a whole set there will be a
number of assurance steps which begin at the start of a piece of work in each
business area and complete with the handover of a completed HNG-X
Requirements set. Fujitsu Services are fully involved in this approach from the
beginning of the process through to final baselining of the HNG-X Requirements
set, and will assist in optimising the overall Use Case model so that constraints
applicable to the existing Horizon architecture are not unnecessarily carried
forward into the HNG-X System.

REQUIREMENT ANALYSIS METHOD

Analyst teams from both Parties will progressively develop the Use Case specifications
required for each business area, initially assessing the proposed Use Case goals and
descriptions and the various source materials to determine their status and relevance.
The required business processes and logical operations will be described as Use Cases,
with each being developed through normal flow and then variant and exception paths with
interaction at key stages with the HNG-X Requirements Assurance process.

Certain Use Cases relate to functionality that Fujitsu Services has proposed will be
delivered by solution components that are retained from Horizon. These are classified as
“Retained Functionality” Use Cases and it has been agreed that these Use Cases will
only require a minimum level of functional specification.

HNG-X REQUIREMENTS ASSURANCE
Introduction

HNG-X Requirements Assurance represents a significant and necessary stage in the
HNG-X solution lifecycle, providing the means by which Post Office and Fujitsu Services
can progressively gain confidence in the scope, capabilities and impact of the emerging
HNG-X Requirements and solution artefacts. The assurance role will involve both
business and functional content assurance and ‘solution design’ assurance. Fujitsu
Services will support Post Office in both of these activities — initially through the provision
of knowledgeable personnel to assist in minimising the risk of functional omission and
subsequently to work with Post Office to verify and improve various aspects of the
emergent solution, both in terms of solution optimisation and economic rationalisation of
HNG-X Requirements.

Assurance Steps.
The approach is underpinned by a series of assurance steps which cover:

4.2.1 content assurance: gradually moving towards a series of fully dressed Use Cases
through a series of assurance stages which verify them on an incremental basis;

4.2.2 optimisation and completion:

(a) ensuring all Use Cases are up to date with all relevant Horizon or HNG-
X changes and are collectively consistent; and

(b) giving visibility of the HNG-X Requirements to Fujitsu Services in order
to obtain feedback from a solution perspective on any optimisation or
improvement opportunities. It is recognised that these HNG-X
Requirements are still subject to change and that any solution activities
based on this material may be impacted once the final Requirements
Baseline has been issued.

CONFIDENTIAL

43

4.2.3 further Requirements Baseline: if the above process results in amendments to
the HNG-X Requirements, the Requirements Baseline will either be revised or re-
issued.

Roles
The assurance role will encompass the need to:

4.3.1. ensure compliance — by supporting the business analyst teams of both Parties in
following the Requirements Definition Process and their use of the underlying
tools and standards, and in producing deliverables that meet the defined quality
standards;

43.2 achieve assurance — by reviewing the business content of the HNG-X
Requirements artefacts for accuracy and completeness, and by enabling effective
dialogue, optimisation and handover activities with the Fujitsu Services Design
Authority;

4.3.3 ensure integrity and consistency — by applying ‘whole service’ and ‘cross service’
assessments of HNG-X Requirement definitions, shared or common
specifications, and the relationship between newly specified and retained
functionality; and

4.3.4 maintain the Requirements Baseline — by establishing processes for identifying
the various sources of change that will occur throughout Project HNG-X and
managing their application to the Requirements Baseline.

This participative approach will however recognise the overriding roles and
responsibilities of Post Office (in terms of HNG-X Requirements Assurance) and Fujitsu
Services (in terms of solution definition, build and implementation) in this process.

PART 2 - HNG-X REQUIREMENTS BASELINING PROCESS

An initial version of the full set of Functional Requirements will be provided to Fujitsu
Services as part of Post Office issuing an initial Requirements Baseline at the end of the
Requirements Stage. As HNG-X Requirements Assurance may not have been completed
at this point, further amendments to the initial Requirements Baseline may be required in
order to take account of amendments, additions or deletions to HNG-X Requirements as
a result of HNG-X Requirements Assurance. Where the overall impact of such changes
is significant, the Requirements Baseline shall be re-issued by Post Office. Where the
impact is minimal, there would be no need to re-issue the Requirements Baseline and
any amendments shall be dealt with in accordance with paragraph 6.2 of this Schedule
B6.1.

Individual HNG-X Requirements that are not produced as part of the Functional
Requirements Definition Process described in Annex 11 Part 1 may be baselined prior to
establishing the final Requirements Baseline. This approach will enable Fujitsu Services
to make design or solution decisions with more certainty where necessary. At the date of
signature of CCN1200, the HNG-X Requirements are as described in Annexes 3 to 10 to
this Schedule B6.1 and will be marked as baselined at version 0.2. HNG-X Requirements

which become individually baselined after this date will be marked as such in DOORS
and formally handed over to Fujitsu Services ahead of the full HNG-X Requirements set.

For the avoidance of doubt, Fujitsu Services shall not be entitled to reject or refuse an
HNG-X Requirement that complies with the provisions of this Schedule B6.1 other than
in accordance with Clause 34.5.

PART 3 — NON-FUNCTIONAL HNG-X REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO THE USER

INTERFACE DEFINITION PROCESS

The non-functional HNG-X Requirements relating to the HNG-X User Interface will be
established and assured in accordance with the CCD entitled “Establishing and Assuring
the HNG-X User Interface” (REQ/GEN/PRD/0001).

For the purposes of the HNG-X Programme Requirements Change Control Process,
these HNG-X Requirements are categorised as "Type B".

PART 4 — HNG-X REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO THE POSTAL SERVICES DEFINITION

PROCESS

The Functional Requirements relating to the Postal Services will be generated by
following the Functional Requirements Definition Process set out in Part 1 of this Annex
but will be established and assured as defined in the CCD entitled “Postal Services
Business and Operational Context” (REQ/CUS/BRS/0001) by following the Postal
Services Assessment Guidelines in place of the guidelines in Annex 1.

The non-functional HNG-X Requirements relating to the Postal Services will be
established and assured in accordance with the CCD entitled “Postal Services Business
and Operational Context” (REQ/CUS/BRS/0001).

PART 5 —- HNG-X PROGRAMME REQUIREMENTS CHANGE CONTROL PROCESS

INTRODUCTION

The HNG-X Programme Requirements Change Control Process is owned by the Post
Office HNG-X Programme Manager and the Fujitsu Services' HNG-X Programme
Manager, and is intended as a mechanism which applies a discretionary level of control
to the scope of the HNG-X Requirements without invoking the Change Control Procedure.

An HNG-X Programme Change Authority will be established with representation from the
Fujitsu Services' Design Authority and the Post Office Design Authority who will be
responsible for the initial impact assessment of proposed changes and for recommending
to the Post Office HNG-X Programme Manager and the Fujitsu Services’ HNG-X
Programme Manager whether a change can be dealt with within their level of authority.
Final responsibility for this decision remains with the Post Office HNG-X Programme
Manager and the Fujitsu Services' HNG-X Programme Manager.

The treatment of a proposed change will differ depending on whether the HNG-X
Requirement to which the change is proposed has been baselined, has been baselined
at high level, or is still under development. These are categorised respectively as “Type

Schedule B6.1 Annex 11 Version 14.0

24

A’, “Type B” and “Type C” HNG-X Requirements, with their treatment described in
paragraph 2 of this Part 5 of this Annex. New HNG-X Requirements are categorised as
“Type D’.

Subject to paragraph 1.5, the HNG-X Programme Requirements Change Control Process
will cease to operate after the end of the Requirements Stage, after which changes to
HNG-X Requirements will be dealt with through the Change Control Procedure.

After the end of the Requirements Stage, the HNG-X Programme Requirements Change
Control Process shall continue to apply to:

1.5.1 the management of changes or additions to the HNG-X Requirements as a result
of HNG-X Requirements Assurance or HNG-X Solution Assurance in accordance
with paragraph 6.2.2 of this Schedule;

1.5.2 the management of a deviation of a Postal Services Requirement from the Postal
Services Assessment Guidelines in accordance with paragraph 6.2.3(b) of this
Schedule;

1.5.3 for any HNG-X Requirement other than a Postal Services Requirement, the
management of a deviation from the Business Equivalence Principles in
accordance with paragraph 6.2.3(a) of this Schedule; and

1.5.4 for any HNG-X Requirement, the management of an inconsistency between that
HNG-X Requirement and (a) an HNG-X Assumption related to that HNG-X
Requirement (and set out or referred to in the same Annex to this Schedule as
that HNG-X Requirement) or (b) the HNG-X Assumption set out in Annex 12, in
accordance with paragraph 4.1.2 or 4.1.3 of this Schedule (as the case may be).

TREATMENT OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF HNG-X REQUIREMENTS
Non Baselined Functional Requirements (Requirement Type C)

2.1.1. Any Functional Requirement which has not been individually baselined and which
does not depart from the Business Equivalence Principles is regarded as under
development and is not subject to the Change Control Procedure or HNG-X
Programme Change Assessment.

2.1.2 Where the generation of a Functional Requirement deviates from the Business
Equivalence Principles (as recognised by the author of the HNG-X Requirement
or as identified during HNG-X Requirements Assurance) and is not the result of
an Agreed Change, an assessment will be made by the HNG-X Programme
Change Authority against the conditions for an Allowed Change as set out in
paragraph 4.2.3 of this Schedule B6.1 as follows:

(a) where the HNG-X Requirement is agreed as fulfilling the conditions of
an Allowed Change, the agreement will be logged by the HNG-X
Programme Change Authority as an Allowed Change and the HNG-X
Requirement may continue to be developed without recourse to the

Schedule B6.1 Annex 11 Version 14.0
Page 33 of 39

FUJ00234786
FUJ00234786
CONFIDENTIAL
Change Control Procedure or HNG-X Programme Change Assessment;
and
(b) where the HNG-X Requirement does not fulfil the conditions of an

Allowed Change, the HNG-X Requirement must be passed for HNG-X
Programme Change Assessment or reverted to a definition which
accords with the Business Equivalence Principles.

2.2 Requirements Baselined at High Level including Agreed Changes (Requirement
Type B)

2.2.1

HNG-X Requirements, including Agreed Changes, which are baselined at high
level may be described or elaborated in more detail within the scope of the high
level HNG-X Requirement without recourse to the Change Control Procedure or
HNG-X Programme Change Assessment. However, where the elaboration of the
HNG-X Requirement extends the scope (as recognised by the author of the HNG-
X Requirement or as identified during HNG-X Requirements Assurance or HNG-
X Solution Assurance, and which for Postal Services Requirements shall be
assessed against the scope defined in section 4 of the CCD entitled “Postal
Services Business and Operational Context” (REQ/CUS/BRS/0001) using the
Postal Services Assessment Guidelines), an assessment will be made by the
HNG-X Programme Change Authority as to whether the extension of scope fulfils
the conditions that it must have an acceptable cost, time, risk and resourcing
impact on Project HNG-X and appropriate actions will be taken as follows:

(a) where the extension of scope is agreed as fulfilling the above conditions,
the extension of scope will be adopted under the governance of the
HNG-X Programme Change Authority and the HNG-X Requirement or
Agreed Change may continue to be developed without recourse to the
Change Control Procedure or HNG-X Programme Change Assessment;
and

(b) where the extension to scope does not fulfil the above conditions, the
extension to scope must be passed for HNG-X Programme Change
Assessment or reverted to a definition within the scope of the higher
level HNG-X Requirement.

23 Baselined Requirements (Requirement Type A)

Once an HNG-X Requirement has been agreed and individually baselined, any proposed
change to that HNG-X Requirement will be passed for HNG-X Programme Change
Assessment. Following the formal handover of the final Requirements Baseline any
HNG-X Requirements which have been assessed as deviating from the Business
Equivalence Principles (in the case of all HNG-X Requirements other than Postal Services
Requirements) or the Postal Services Assessment Guidelines (in the case of Postal
Services Requirements) shall also be passed for HNG-X Programme Change
Assessment.

New HNG-X Requirements will be initially assessed by the HNG-X Programme Change
Authority to determine whether they fall within the definition of an Allowed Change. When
the HNG-X Requirement is not assessed as an Allowed Change it will be passed for HNG-
X Programme Change Assessment. When the HNG-X Requirement is assessed as an
Allowed Change it will be processed as an HNG-X Requirement Type C in accordance
with paragraph 2.1 of Part 5 of this Annex.

Fujitsu Services may propose that any additional or new HNG-X Requirement be subject
to a caveat detailing any exceptions to full compliance in respect of that particular HNG-
X Requirement only (and not in respect of any HNG-X Requirement already forming part
of the HNG-X Requirements Catalogue) and the Parties shall, acting reasonably and in
good faith, agree whether to adopt that caveat in respect of that particular HNG-X
Requirement

HNG-X PROGRAMME CHANGE ASSESSMENT

Proposed changes to HNG-X Requirements, new HNG-X Requirements and any
changes or additions to the non-functional HNG-X Requirements relating to the HNG-X
User Interface or Postal Services which are passed for HNG-X Programme Change
Assessment will be initially assessed by the HNG-X Programme Change Authority to
determine whether the change is likely to impact time or cost beyond the level of authority
of the Post Office HNG-X Programme Manager and the Fujitsu Services’ HNG-X
Programme Manager, or whether there is likely to be any impact outside of Project HNG-
x.

Where the change will clearly exceed this authority or will clearly have an impact outside
the Project HNG-X, the change will be dealt with under the Change Control Procedure (or
agreed with the author to be rejected).

Where the change appears likely to have minimal impact such that, considered with other
proposed changes, it can be managed within the level of authority of the Post Office HNG-
X Programme Manager and the Fujitsu Services’ HNG-X Programme Manager and has
no impact external to the Project HNG-X, the change will be passed to the appropriate
team within Fujitsu Services or Post Office to undertake further impact assessment (under
the control of the HNG-X Programme Change Authority).

If the further impact assessment referred to in paragraph 3.3 of this Part 5 confirms the
initial assessment, the change will be approved and the HNG-X Requirement can be
updated accordingly, subject to the final approval of the Post Office HNG-X Programme
Manager and the Fujitsu Services’ HNG-X Programme Manager. Once approved, if the
change relates to a Functional Requirement, the change shall be deemed to be an Agreed
Change. The baselined status (as indicated by the Requirement Type A, B C or D) of the
HNG-X Requirement will not be changed by this process, but the version number of the
HNG-X Requirement will be updated accordingly.

If the further impact assessment referred to in paragraph 3.3 of this Part 5 rejects the
initial assessment, the change will be dealt with under the Change Control Procedure (or

agreed with the author to be rejected).

SCHEDULE B6.2

HNG-X DESIGN AND BUILD
INTRODUCTION

This Schedule deals with:

1.4 an overview of the manner in which the HNG-X Requirements set out in
or generated by the process in Schedule B6.1 will be logged and
confirmed;

1.2 the agreed processes for design and development in support of the
solution specification, build and test stages of the lifecycle of the HNG-X
Development, including offshore development. The Parties acknowledge
that Post Office is embarking on a project management methodology
referred to as RMG Harmony. This methodology is in development at the
date of signature of CCN1200. As such this Schedule may or may not
align with RMG Harmony. In the event that Post Office requires changes
to this Schedule to better align it with RMG Harmony those changes will
be dealt with in accordance with the Change Control Procedure;

1.3 an overview of the Solution Baseline Documentation Set;

1.4 maintenance of the HNG-X Programme Plan and associated budgeting
and reporting; and

1.5 other matters relating to the conduct of Project HNG-X and the
Associated Changes.

HNG-X REQUIREMENTS.

The HNG-X Requirements that will form the Requirements Baseline are referred
to in, or will be generated in the manner defined in, Schedule B6.1.

Fujitsu Services will establish a method of requirements traceability against the
Requirements Baseline for use during the HNG-X Development Period. Fujitsu
Services will provide Post Office with a completed compliance matrix for all HNG-
X Requirements listed in the Requirements Baseline by the milestone entitled
“Requirements Compliance Matrix Baselined” in the HNG-X Programme Plan.

SOLUTION BASELINE DOCUMENTATION SET

Fujitsu Services shall develop a set of documents and other artefacts that
accurately reflects the Solution Baseline (the “Solution Baseline Documentation
Set’). The Solution Baseline Documentation Set will consist of updated
versions of Schedules B3.2, B3.3 and B3.4, the Solution Architecture, and more
detailed information (which may be based on aspects of the Requirements
Baseline and/or a set of architectural and design artefacts). The Parties shall
work together throughout the two month period following the end of the
Requirements Stage to agree by the end of that period the list of documents

and other artefacts that will form the Solution Baseline Documentation Set
(together with a summary description for each such document and artefact).

Changes to components or component usage explicitly described in the
Solution Architecture, or in other documents and artefacts of the Solution
Baseline Documentation Set which have been agreed between the Parties as
requiring Post Office approval, shall be approved by Post Office and Fujitsu
Services.

ARCHITECTURE & DESIGN

Fujitsu Services will create and maintain, for the duration of the HNG-X
Development Period, an architectural solution description, which shall be
developed from the Solution Architecture and shall take account of relevant
HNG-X Requirements (the "Architectural Solution Description"). The Architectural
Solution Description will be used to support HNG-X Solution Assurance in the
manner described in paragraph 5.4.2 and the Parties shall agree, in accordance
with paragraph 3, which elements of the Architectural Solution Description shall
form part of the Solution Baseline Documentation Set.

The Architectural Solution Description will consist of a number of architectural
and design artefacts that capture the design characteristics of the component
sub-systems of the solution. The architectural and design artefacts will take a
number of forms, dependent on the nature of the sub-system but typically
dictated by whether the component is to be newly created or retained or
enhanced legacy. Architectural and design artefact production will be tracked
through the HNG-X Programme Plan. Fujitsu Services shall work with Post Office
to agree, such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld, the form of the
architectural and design artefacts by the date for such agreement set out in the
HNG-X Programme Plan.

HNG-X SOLUTION ASSURANCE

HNG-X Solution Assurance is a significant and necessary activity in the HNG-X
solution lifecycle providing the means by which Post Office and Fujitsu Services
will progressively gain confidence in the emerging solution.

HNG-X Solution Assurance will continue the engagement between Post Office
and Fujitsu Services that was established to conduct Requirements Assurance
as a pre-cursor to establishing the Requirements Baseline.

The objectives of HNG-X Solution Assurance are to enable:

5.3.1. Post Office and Fujitsu Services to develop a common and shared
understanding of the Requirements Baseline;

5.3.2 Post Office to amplify, explain or clarify any points of difficulty in the
interpretation of the Requirements Baseline as requested by Fujitsu
Services;

Schedule B6.2 Version 14.0
Page 3 of 26

FUJ00234786

FUJ00234786
CONFIDENTIAL

5.3.3

Post Office and Fujitsu Services to monitor the progress of the Solution
Baseline towards satisfying the Requirements Baseline;

Post Office and Fujitsu Services to progressively gain confidence in the
completeness and integrity of the Solution Baseline;

Fujitsu Services to confirm to Post Office the operational effect of
applying the HNG-X Assumptions to the Architectural Solution
Description; and

Fujitsu Services to advise Post Office of potential operational or
functional implications which may arise in the development of the
Architectural Solution Description and for Post Office to consider
appropriate actions, such actions to be agreed between the Parties.
Such advice shall not include operational implications relating to the
usability characteristics of the HNG-X User Interface or the user interface
of the CSRDE, where such implications would be specific to Post Office's
business operations and practices.

5.4 HNG-X Solution Assurance Roles and Responsibilities

5.4.1

5.4.2

5.4.3

5.4.4

5.4.5

The HNG-X Solution Assurance role will be led by the Post Office Design
Authority and his team, supported by Fujitsu Services.

Fujitsu Services will demonstrate, through discussion and by the
provision of appropriate architectural and design artefacts, how the
Design and Architecture Requirements are met. In addition, Fujitsu
Services will, through the provision of an appropriate compliance matrix,
demonstrate the incorporation of all of the HNG-X Requirements in the
Requirements Baseline against relevant solution artefacts.

During HNG-X Solution Assurance Post Office will not specify any design
or design component to Fujitsu Services but will provide feedback where
it does not reasonably believe that the solution design will correctly meet
the Requirements Baseline, or where it believes that the solution
outcome would result in unacceptable implications.

HNG-X Solution Assurance will be carried out via a joint design forum
and ad-hoc discussions provided that the workings of the design forum or
the holding of such ad-hoc discussions do not adversely impact progress
against the HNG-X Programme Plan. Where Fujitsu Services believes
that such an adverse impact has occurred or is likely to occur, then this
issue shall be raised with both the Post Office HNG-X Programme
Manager and the Fujitsu Services’ HNG-X Programme Manager for
resolution and such impact shall be assessed via the mechanisms
described in paragraph 13.1.

This participative approach will recognise the respective and overriding
roles and responsibilities of Post Office (in terms of HNG-X Requirements

Assurance) and of Fujitsu Services (in terms of solution definition, build
and implementation) in this process.

DEVELOPMENT

Fujitsu Services will develop the components of the solution using a combination
of “waterfall”, iterative and prototyping development methods as appropriate to
the component or sub-system being created. In general:

6.1.1 the “waterfall” approach will typically be used for retained “legacy” in the
Data Centre and those components that are related to the internal
workings of the solution (not business/user visible);

6.1.2 iterative methods will typically be used to deliver subsets of business
functionality earlier in the lifecycle (to support incremental testing); and

6.1.3 prototyping will typically be deployed where the requirements are not
clearly understood or where Fujitsu Services and Post Office jointly agree
that this is the correct approach for the creation of a particular aspect of
the system.

Fujitsu Services will agree with Post Office, such agreement not to be
unreasonably withheld, which development method will be used for each sub-
system or component of the solution.

Fujitsu Services will act in accordance with the Fujitsu Services “Solution
Framework” methodologies, as enhanced by the Fujitsu Services team to support
the needs of the development stream and this will be captured in revisions to the
Working Document “Development Strategy for HNG-X” (DEV/MGT/STG/0001),
which will be shared with Post Office. Decisions on which development tooling
and development methodologies are to be used will be driven out of the
programme and implemented within the project lifecycle as indicated by Level 2
key milestones in the HNG-X Programme Plan.

Each Party shall comply with its obligations set out in Annex 2 to this Schedule
with regard to the HNG-X Development.

Fujitsu Services shall provide a measurement mechanism which can be used to
estimate the functional size and complexity of software components and which
can be used to estimate the functional size and complexity of future software
changes.

In accordance with agreed Work Order(s), Fujitsu Services shall support Post
Office in activities necessary for Post Office to achieve:

6.5.1 certification, accreditation or assurance with its Clients or other third
parties; and

6.5.2 _ re-certification or re-accreditation with its Clients or other third parties.

Fujitsu Services shall allow Post Office training development staff access to the
pre-release solution as is becomes available, to facilitate the development by
Post Office of accurate training material.

TESTING

Project HNG-X will follow a jointly developed, jointly agreed testing strategy that
has been created to exploit the benefits of the re-engineered solution to be
delivered by a service oriented architecture (as that term is described in the
Solution Architecture) and an object oriented development approach. From the
agreed testing strategy, revisions to the generic testing processes will be drawn.
The approach will re-balance the testing lifecycle to strengthen the earlier stages
of testing and thus reduce the risk of significant issues emerging in the later
stages. To ensure that each stage of testing delivers the appropriate contribution
to the programme it is important to establish and manage the commencement
(trends, stability, readiness) and completion (coverage, completeness, closure)
criteria for each testing stage.

Each test stage will have associated, documented quality gates (QGs) that will
support the readiness review process to decide whether it is appropriate to enter
or leave the stage of testing to which the QGs relate. The entry QG will be based
on objective entry criteria, drawn from generic checklists, to support the
assessment of readiness, timeliness, worth and risk.

Independent testing of the solution will be carried out by a jointly resourced and
managed team where each organisation takes leadership of an individual test
stage as agreed between the Parties. The scheduling of tests shall take account
of, and be consistent with, the HNG-X Acceptance Plan.

The Parties will use reasonable endeavours to jointly agree, by the touchpoint in
the HNG-X Programme Plan entitled “HNG-X Testing Approach Agreed”, such
agreement not to be unreasonably withheld, a CCD entitled “Testing Approach
for HNG-X” (TST/GEN/STG/0002) which will define the joint approach to be used
for testing. Such CCD will be based on the then current version of the Working
Document “HNG-X Testing Strategy”, the version at the date of signature of
CCN1200 being version 1.0 (March 2006).

ACCEPTANCE

The HNG-X Acceptance Process will be managed in accordance with Schedule
B6.3 by the respective HNG-X Acceptance Managers of Post Office and Fujitsu
Services for the period to HNG-X Initial Acceptance and by the Post Office
Acceptance Manager and Fujitsu Services Post Office Account service
management team for the period from HNG-X Initial Acceptance to HNG-X Final
Acceptance.

HNG-X PROGRAMME PLAN

Fujitsu Services shall maintain the HNG-X Programme Plan for the fulfilment of
its obligations under this Agreement in relation to Project HNG-X and the
Associated Change Activities.

Agreement but has since been removed since the programme has
concluded-.

The Level 3 elements of the HNG-X Programme Plan shall be at a level of detail
equivalent to those elements described as such in Annex 1 to this Schedule (this
is included for illustrative purposes only).

Within eight Working Days of the start of each Planning Period following the date
of signature of CCN 1200, Fujitsu Services shall issue a revised version of the
HNG-X Programme Plan which shall contain:

9.4.1 the Tasks required for completion of Project HNG-X and the Associated
Change Activities;

9.4.2 until 31st October 2006, the Level 3 elements of the HNG-X Programme
Plan associated with such FS Tasks as are scheduled to take place up to
30'" November 2006;

9.4.3 from 18! November 2006, the Level 3 elements of the HNG-X Programme
Plan required for completion of Project HNG-X and those Level 3
elements that are recorded in the HNG-X Programme Plan that are
related to the Associated Change Activities; and

9.4.4 the milestone dates for Post Office Tasks and, so far as reasonably
practicable, Post Office's other obligations under this Agreement, on
which the commencement or completion of an FS Task is dependent (a
“Development Dependency”).

Any revised version of the HNG-X Programme Plan issued pursuant to this
paragraph shall only become effective in accordance with the terms of paragraph
13.

In respect of each version of the HNG-X Programme Plan provided in
accordance with paragraph 9.4, each Level 3 element on the HNG-X Programme
Plan to be performed by Fujitsu Services:

9.5.1 having a deliverable to be produced as a result of that element, shall
have a summary description of that deliverable; and

9.5.2 if related to HNG-X Development, shall have a HNG-X T&M Budget
associated with it.

Fujitsu Services shall complete each of its Tasks, using its reasonable
endeavours to do so by the date shown for the completion of that Task in the
HNG-X Programme Plan.

Development Dependency in the HNG-X Programme Plan.

The initial version of the HNG-X Programme Plan at Level 2 was baselined at
the date of signature of CCN 1246 such that any changes to costs, effort and
timescales could be managed in accordance with this Schedule B6.2.

Certain dates in the initial version of the HNG-X Programme Plan for the key
milestones and touchpoints between Fujitsu Services and Post Office or third
parties for the delivery of Project HNG-X and the Associated Changes, were
formerly agreed as part of this Agreement but have since been removed
since the programme has concluded.

REPORTING AND OBLIGATIONS IF DELAY OCCURS

From the date of signature of CCN 1200, Fujitsu Services shall report to Post
Office in respect of each Planning Period its progress in achieving its Tasks set
out in the HNG-X Programme Plan for that Planning Period and on its
management of the work set out in that plan, such reporting to include earned
value analysis.

Fujitsu Services shall report to Post Office in accordance with paragraph 10.1 not
later than the eighth Working Day after the end of the Planning Period to which
the report relates.

From the date of signature of CCN 1200, Post Office shall report to Fujitsu
Services in respect of each Planning Period its progress in achieving the
Development Dependencies for that Planning Period and on its management of
the work relating to those Development Dependencies.

Post Office shall report to Fujitsu Services in accordance with paragraph 10.3 not
later than the fifth Working Day after the end of the Planning Period to which the

If at any time an FS Task has not been, or Fujitsu Services forecasts that it may
not be, started or completed by the date set for that event in the HNG-X
Programme Plan, Fujitsu Services shall notify Post Office forthwith and shall
provide a report to Post Office with a red, amber, green colour coding system
(“RAG Report’) to highlight that FS Task.

If at any time a Development Dependency has not been, or Post Office forecasts
that it may not be, achieved by the date set for that Development Dependency in
the HNG-X Programme Plan, Post Office shall notify Fujitsu Services forthwith
and shall provide a RAG Report to Fujitsu Services to highlight that Development
Dependency.

If at any time an FS Task has a change in the effort required for its completion
based on the effort for that event in the HNG-X Programme Plan, Fujitsu

Schedule B6.2 Version 14.0

Services shall notify Post Office forthwith and shall provide a RAG Report to
highlight FS Tasks for which the effort has changed. Any change to the effort
required for completion of an FS Task will only take effect in the HNG-X
Programme Plan in accordance with paragraph 13.1.

If a failure or delay to carry out (a) an FS Task or (b) a Level 3 element set out in
the HNG-X Programme Plan to be performed by Fujitsu Services:

10.8.1 affects (a) any key milestone or touchpoint referred to in paragraph 9.9 or
(b) any Development Dependency (in both cases as set out in or derived
from the HNG-X Programme Plan), Fujitsu Services shall as soon as
reasonably practicable provide proposals to mitigate the failure or delay;
or

10.8.2 does not affect (a) any key milestone or touchpoint referred to in
paragraph 9.9 or (b) any Development Dependency (in both cases as set
out in or derived from the HNG-X Programme Plan), Fujitsu Services
shall take such action as is necessary to mitigate the failure or delay and
shall report such action to Post Office in accordance with paragraph 10.1.

Any proposal provided by Fujitsu Services under paragraph 10.8.1 shall be
agreed with Post Office before it is implemented.

If there is a failure or delay to (a) achieve a Development Dependency or (b)
carry out a Level 3 element set out in the HNG-X Programme Plan to be
performed by Post Office, Post Office shall take such action as is necessary to
mitigate the failure or delay and shall report such action to Fujitsu Services in
accordance with paragraph 10.3.

CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL

From the date of signature of CCN 1200 until the HNG-X Initial Acceptance Date,
Fujitsu Services shall supply (and update when changes occur) the name, job
title, project role and grade for those Fujitsu Services personnel working on HNG-
X Development including those personnel that are off-shored.

From the date of signature of CCN 1200 until the HNG-X Initial Acceptance Date,
Fujitsu Services shall produce organisational charts showing Fujitsu Services
personnel working on HNG-X Development including those personnel that are
off-shored. Fujitsu Services shall provide revised versions of those charts to Post
Office when there are material changes to them.

CHANGING THE HNG-X PROGRAMME PLAN

Changes to scheduling of, or the effort required for, Tasks or Development
Dependencies that the Parties consider will not cause the 108.5 Band to be
exceeded and to which paragraph 13.5 does not apply shall require the written
agreement of both Parties at HNG-X Authority Level 1 (such agreement not to be
unreasonably withheld by either Party) and shall take effect immediately upon
that written agreement. Changes to scheduling of, or the effort required for,
Tasks or Development Dependencies that the Parties consider will cause the
108.5 Band to be exceeded and to which paragraph 13.5 does not apply shall be
dealt with under the Change Control Procedure. All changes that impact any of
the dates set out in the HNG-X Programme Plan for any of the key milestones
and touchpoints will be managed under the Change Control Procedure.

13.1.1 Without prejudice to the generality of paragraph 13.1 and subject to that
paragraph, in order to manage (after the date of signature of CCN1246) any
further increases in the chargeable man day estimates provided by Fujitsu
Services to complete the HNG-X Development and/or Associated Change
Development:

(a) Fujitsu Services HNG-X Programme Director shall notify Post Office HNG-X
Programme Manager in writing of any change in the aggregate number of man
days budgeted (as chargeable to Post Office) to complete the HNG-X
Development or Associated Change Development (“a man-day change”);

(b) In relation to any such man-day change of 20 days or less, Post Office shall
be deemed to have approved such change unless it notifies Fujitsu Services
within 2 working days of receipt (unless such man-day change coupled with all
other man-day changes in that month exceeds 100 man-days);

(c) for any man-day change not within sub-paragraph (b) above, the Fujitsu
HNG-X Programme Director and the Post Office HNG-X Programme Manager
shall promptly meet to agree in writing the approach to be taken in relation to
such proposed change;

(d) all man-day changes within a calendar month will be discussed at a monthly
meeting to be combined with the last Joint Supply Board of each month.

If the Parties fail to reach agreement at HNG-X Authority Level 1 on a change of
the type described in the first sentence of paragraph 13.1, the dispute shall be
referred to HNG-X Authority Level 2. If the Parties fail to reach such agreement
at HNG-X Authority Level 2, the dispute shall be referred for resolution at the
Executive Review level of the DRP and if not resolved shall (unless the Parties
agree otherwise) be escalated further in accordance with the DRP.

Fujitsu Services shall be entitled at its discretion to reschedule the Level 3
elements of the HNG-X Programme Plan within the period bounded by the start

and completion dates for the associated Task in the HNG-X Programme Plan.

Failure to complete a Task due to Fujitsu Services’ Default

To the extent that a failure by Fujitsu Services to carry out an FS Task by the
completion date for that Task in the HNG-X Programme Plan is due to a Default
of Fujitsu Services, then:

13.4.1.1 Fujitsu Services shall not be entitled to extend the period for the
completion of that FS Task or revise the HNG-X T&M Budget for that
FS Task without the agreement of Post Office in accordance with the
provisions of paragraph 13.1; and

13.4.1.2 the cost of preparing reports and proposals and taking any mitigating
action in accordance with paragraph 10 shall be borne by Fujitsu
Services.

To the extent that a failure by Post Office to achieve a Development Dependency
by the achievement date for that Development Dependency in the HNG-X
Programme Plan is due to a Default of Fujitsu Services, then:

14. OFFSHORE DEVELOPMENT

14.1 Appointment and Induction of Offshore Development Partner

14.1.1

14.1.2

14.1.3

Fujitsu Services has appointed Zensar Technologies UK Limited as an
HNG-X Sub-contractor, in the role of offshore development partner (the
“Offshore Development Partner”). This paragraph 14 sets out the
circumstances in which Fujitsu Services may use the Offshore
Development Partner, its management of the Offshore Development
Partner and Post Office's role in that process. It is without prejudice to
Fujitsu Services obligations under Clause 58.2.

Fujitsu Services will agree the appointment, by the Offshore
Development Partner, of a Fujitsu Services’ Offshore Project Manager
and a Fujitsu Services’ Offshore Design Authority to oversee the Offshore
Development Partner's contribution to HNG-X Development work. These
appointments will be notified to Post Office by Fujitsu Services as soon
as reasonably practicable.

Fujitsu Services will ensure that the Fujitsu Services' Offshore Project
Manager and the Fujitsu Services' Offshore Design Authority appointed
by the Offshore Development Partner have a full understanding of both
the technical solution proposed and the business environment within Post
Office sufficient to fulfil Fujitsu Services’ obligations in respect of offshore
activities.

14.1.5

The Fujitsu Services' Offshore Project Manager and the Fujitsu Services’
Offshore Design Authority will ensure that such induction information is
communicated within the Offshore Development Partner's teams through
mandatory briefings and a record will be maintained to demonstrate all
individuals have received this communication. Post Office will agree the
content of this communication in advance, such agreement not to be
unreasonably withheld.

The Parties will agree Post Office's involvement in the activities, including
any support to be provided to Fujitsu Services, set out in paragraphs
14.1.3 and 14.1.4, such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld by
either Party.

14.2 Use of Offshore Development Partner

14.2.1

14.2.2

14.2.3

14.2.4

Fujitsu Services will propose which components of the solution are to be
produced offshore on a case-by-case basis and which aspects of
development (design, development, test) are to be produced by the
Offshore Development Partner. Fujitsu Services shall provide reasonable
notice to Post Office to consider such proposals and shall seek Post
Office agreement to these proposals before they are implemented, such
agreement not to be unreasonably withheld. The decision to offshore the
development of a component will be based on information that will
include architectural considerations, skills availability, development
knowledge, support constraints and security measures.

Before Fujitsu Services proposes to Post Office, pursuant to paragraph
14.2.1, that any HNG-X Development work be undertaken by the
Offshore Development Partner, Fujitsu Services shall, at no cost to the
Post Office, carry out an assessment of the potential risks involved in
such work being undertaken offshore by the Offshore Development
Partner. Such assessment shall consider any potential risks arising from
the physical, logical and management security standards to be followed
by the Offshore Development Partner in undertaking such work.

Fujitsu Services shall disclose to Post Office (a) the results of the
assessment referred to in paragraph 14.2.2 and (b) details of the
processes, procedures, systems and controls it has or intends to put in
place to address the risks identified in that assessment. The
commencement of any offshore HNG-X Development work by the
Offshore Development Partner shall be conditional on Post Office
confirming to Fujitsu Services that it is satisfied with such assessment
and such processes, procedures, systems and controls.

Fujitsu Services will enter into contractual arrangements with the
Offshore Development Partner that will entitle it to require the Offshore
Development Partner to put in place the following security measures in
respect of any HNG-X Development work undertaken by it offshore:

14.2.7

(a) physically isolating the Offshore Development Partner's
development environment for HNG-X Development from other
areas, with access restricted to only those resources of the
Offshore Development Partner who are carrying out such
activities; and

(b) isolating the Offshore Development Partner's networks for such
development environment from other areas and other networks
including data security, network security, server security,
document security and web security.

As a result of an assessment conducted pursuant to paragraph 14.2.2 or
otherwise, the Parties may agree in writing that the Offshore
Development Partner implement the measures referred to in this
paragraph in relation to HNG-X Development work. As part of any such
agreement, the Parties shall also agree any additional charges to be paid
by Post Office for those measures, such charges to reflect any additional
costs incurred by the Offshore Development Partner in implementing
those measures.

Fujitsu Services shall be responsible for ensuring that the Offshore
Development Partner implements and observes any security measures
disclosed to Post Office pursuant to paragraph 14.2.3 (to the extent they
are relevant to the Offshore Development Partner) or agreed by the
Parties pursuant to paragraph 14.2.4. Other than as referred to in
paragraph 14.2.4, the cost of such security measures shall be borne by
Fujitsu Services

The requirements for the components of the solution that are to be
developed offshore will be passed to the Offshore Development Partner
under the control of the Fujitsu Services’ ‘Requirements and Acceptance’
team, in accordance with established Project HNG-X practice. The
Fujitsu Services' Offshore Design Authority will actively participate in the
review, interpretation and assurance of these requirements. Fujitsu
Services will arrange reviews involving the Fujitsu Services Design
Authority, the Fujitsu Services' Offshore Design Authority and the Post
Office Design Authority where it believes significant clarification or better
understanding of an HNG-X Requirement is needed. Post Office may
request Fujitsu Services to arrange such a review if it reasonably
believes a review to be necessary for specific HNG-X Requirements.

The independent testing stages of Project HNG-X will be supported by
the Offshore Development Partner's personnel working on and offshore
and it is anticipated that there will be regular contact with the joint Post
Office and Fujitsu Services testing team with respect to offshore
developed technology where this touches the business/user environment.
Aseries of two way visits is envisaged.

Fujitsu Services has appointed the Fujitsu Services Project Manager,
who is a senior project management professional, to oversee the
relationship with the Offshore Development Partner to ensure that
synergy with the programme is maintained and pro-actively managed.
The Fujitsu Services Project Manager will ensure all risks associated with
the offshore development are managed, such risks and their associated
action plans to be shared with Post Office.

Offshore activities will be included within the HNG-X Programme Plan
(Levels 1, 2 and 3) and weekly time recording will be supported within
Fujitsu Services’ standard RTR toolset, in accordance with agreed
reporting processes for Project HNG-X. Offshore activities will be
included within Project HNG-X reporting in accordance with this Schedule
B6.2.

Fujitsu Services will hold all offshore generated artefacts within the
nominated repositories for Project HNG-X and knowledge share will be
supported by the continued involvement of offshore staff within their
respective programme communities (design, development and test).

Fujitsu Services will ensure that all risks and issues that originate or are
identified offshore are managed through the appropriate programme
registers and processes. Such risks and issues will be made visible to
Post Office who will be invited to participate in their resolution.

Fujitsu Services will work with the Offshore Development Partner to put in
place measures, equivalent to those set out at Clause 41 (Fujitsu
Services Key Personnel) of this Agreement, aimed at ensuring that the
Fujitsu Services' Offshore Project Manager and the Fujitsu Services’
Offshore Design Authority are retained as key personnel.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Offshore Development Partner's
compliance with the provisions of this paragraph 14 and its performance
of any of Fujitsu Services’ obligations under this Agreement shall be
subject to the same rights of audit as if those obligations were performed
by Fujitsu Services and Fujitsu Services shall ensure that the Offshore
Development Partner maintains Records and cooperates with, and
provides assistance and information in relation to, any audit, in each case
in accordance with Clause 25 (Audit).

ANNEX 2
DEVELOPMENT RULES

DEFINITIONS

For the purposes of this Annex only, the following terms shall have the following meanings:

Clean Room means the separate operational environment
where the Clean Room Team will work during
the development lifecycle for production of the
Clean Room Outputs;

Clean Room Outputs means the UI and CSRDE outputs for the
HNG-X business application developed by
Fujitsu Services in the Clean Room;

Clean Room Rules means the set of operational processes and
practices used by the Clean Room Team to
work on the Clean Room Outputs as set out in
Section C of this Annex;

Clean Room Team means all individuals engaged on Project
HNG-X by Fujitsu Services who are based in
the Clean Room;

Fujitsu Filter Team means the identified individuals in the General
Development Team (and outside the Clean
Room) responsible for the interface with the
Clean Room Team;

HNG-X by Fujitsu Services who are involved
in the creation or use of IPR; and

General Development Team Rules means the rules set out in Section B of this
Annex.

Schedule B6.2 Annex 2 Version 14.0
Page 20 of 26
CONFIDENTIAL,
SECTION A: GENERAL
41. BACKGROUND
1.1 Fujitsu Services does not intentionally engage in the production of software or

1.2

1.3

24

2.2

23

24

25

systems which unlawfully copy the proprietary works of others. Nor does it
intentionally misuse confidential information to assist such production.

In addition Fujitsu Services takes appropriate steps to ensure the potential risk of
inadvertent copying of proprietary works is minimised.

As a result of Post Office's business decisions not to continue using the parts of
the current Horizon systems from Fujitsu Services’ existing subcontractor there is a
possibility that Fujitsu Services will be required to produce evidence that the
replacement software did not benefit either from the unlawful copying by Fujitsu
Services of proprietary material or the misuse of third party confidential
information.

APPROACH

This document sets out the approach agreed between Fujitsu Services and Post
Office:

2.1.1. to control the risk of infringement of third party rights during the
development of HNG-X; and

2.1.2 to enable Fujitsu Services to demonstrate that Fujitsu Services design and
code outputs are based upon the HNG-X Requirements not the unlawful
copying or misuse by Fujitsu Services of third party rights in existing
systems.

The use of the Clean Room is to produce Clean Room Outputs based only on the
Post Office's HNG-X Requirements and not created as a result of any unlawful
copying or misuse by Fujitsu Services of third party rights in existing systems.

Post Office acknowledges that it has a role to play to assist Fujitsu Services in
avoiding the risk of infringement of that third party IPR and Section D of this Annex
sets out details of the actions and responsibilities of Post Office in this respect.

The rules applicable to the Clean Room are not intended to replace those
applicable to the General Development Team. The General Development Team
Rules shall unless modified by the Clean Room Rules also apply to the Clean
Room Team.

Neither the Clean Room Rules nor the General Development Team Rules shall
replace Fujitsu Services’ other applicable general development or quality
assurance obligations. Rather the Clean Room Rules and the General
Development Team Rules are intended to bring specific focus and awareness in

areas where these need to be modified or augmented to meet identified risks of
IPR infringement.

SCOPE
The Parties have agreed that where there are real risks of actual IPR infringement
Fujitsu Services shall put in place a system where part of its team (the “Clean

Room Team’) will work in isolation to prevent such infringement.

For the purpose of this Annex the additional rules applicable to the Clean Room
Team are called the Clean Room Rules.

SECTION B: GENERAL DEVELOPMENT TEAM RULES

GENERAL

These rules apply to all of the activities undertaken by Fujitsu Services for Post
Office involving the creation or use of IPR.

General Development Team shall not use, copy or adapt (from any other
programming language) or reverse engineer any third party proprietary software or
software tool (and its related documentation) unless they have first satisfied
themselves that:

4.2.1 they know the origin of the same; and

4.2.2 Fujitsu Services is licensed or otherwise authorised to make use of such
IPR in this way.

For the avoidance of doubt in respect of the General Development Team there
shall be no separation physical or functional outside the Clean Room of ongoing
maintenance and other work in respect of Horizon and the development of HNG-X.

INDIVIDUALS ENGAGED

Members of the General Development Team (other than the Clean Room Team)
may have background knowledge of Horizon and access to Horizon code and
Escher APIs.

All members of the General Development Team shall have been briefed
appropriately on the General Development Team Rules and of the need to ensure
that all contact with the Clean Room Team is through the Fujitsu Filter Team.

Adherence by the General Development Team to the General Development Team
Rules shall be through normal supervision by Fujitsu Services line management.

RECORDS

The General Development Team shall maintain such records as are required
through its normal development procedures and good industry practice.

AUDIT AND COMPLIANCE

Fujitsu Services will implement appropriate controls to check compliance with the
General Development Team Rules through its management organisation.

Compliance with the General Development Rules and the Clean Room Rules shall
be subject to the standard Fujitsu Services' company quality audit procedure.

CHANGES TO THE GENERAL DEVELOPMENT TEAM RULES
Fujitsu Services shall retain the ability to control changes to the General
Development Team Rules and to modify and update such General Development

Team Rules provided any such changes are good industry practice

SECTION C: CLEAN ROOM RULES

IDENTIFYING THE NEED FOR A CLEAN ROOM PROCESS

Fujitsu Services does not intend to unlawfully copy third party proprietary material
included in the existing Horizon system or otherwise.

To ensure that this is not done inadvertently and to assist in proving that the
development of HNG-X took place lawfully Fujitsu Services shall ensure that work
or parts of work needed to create certain HNG-X elements are performed by
Fujitsu Services under Clean Room Rules by a separate development team
located in a Clean Room with inputs and outputs suitably monitored and recorded.

In order to avoid any infringement or risk of infringement the following elements of
the project need to be created in the separate environment to which these Clean

Room Rules shall apply:

A. Work to create UI Clean Room Outputs

° UI Construct Catalogue to create new constructs defined by UI Clean
Room Team;

° UI Prototypes for use in Usability Trials;

. HNG-X Style Guide being the final formal documentation of UI Clean

Room Outputs; and

B. Work to create CSRDE Clean Room Outputs

. Carrier Services technical data model, including schema, to meet the
Postal Services Requirements;

° CSRDT,
. the design of the user interface for using the CSRDT; and
. the design and prototype of the code to access the CSRDE from the

Postal Services Functional Requirements.

The Parties will jointly keep under review through the governance arrangements
set out in Schedule A2 and the Change Control Procedure and Work Ordering
Procedure the risks of infringement of any other aspects or third party rights and
the action required including the creation of Clean Room conditions for such
additional elements.

CLEAN ROOM TEAM

Fujitsu Services shall make arrangements for the creation at a location physically
separated from its main development team of a group (initially eight to ten people)
who will be responsible for creating the Ul and CSRDE Clean Room Outputs.

Fujitsu Services shall ensure that the development personnel in the Clean Room
Team are selected by Fujitsu Services so as to avoid the use of individuals with
prior knowledge of any relevant third party materials and software. For the HNG-X
UI Clean Room process Fujitsu Services shall select only those personnel who
have not had significant experience of, or any access to the source materials of,
the existing Horizon UI. For the CSRDE Clean Room process, Fujitsu Services
shall select only those personnel who have not had significant experience of, or
any access to the source materials of, the existing Escher Mails data editor.
Members of the Clean Room Team shall be requested to confirm that they have
not had such experience or access.

After their selection, Fujitsu Services shall ensure that the Clean Room Team shall
not have any access to any relevant third party materials and software used in the
Horizon system. For the HNG-X UI Clean Room process, Fujitsu Services shall
ensure that the relevant personnel shall continue not to have access to the source
materials of the existing Horizon UI. For the CSRDE Clean Room process, Fujitsu
Services shall ensure that the relevant personnel shall continue not to have access
to the existing Escher Mails data editor.

Fujitsu Services shall ensure that members of the Clean Room Team do not have
knowledge of or access to any relevant Escher materials and software (including
the source materials) and that they do not attempt to obtain such knowledge or
access.

Fujitsu Services shall restrict access by Clean Room Team to personnel outside of
the Clean Room whether in General Development Team or elsewhere that might
have such knowledge or materials so that the isolation of the Clean Room Team
does not become ineffective.

Fujitsu Services shall make and keep suitable records of the input of information
software and materials to the Clean Room.

Each member of the Clean Room Team shall be responsible for keeping suitable
personal records of their Clean Room activity.

FUJITSU FILTER TEAM

Communication with the Clean Room Team shall be via a nominated set of
individuals (the “Fujitsu Filter Team”) external to the Clean Room Team who shall
be responsible for recording and vetting of inputs to the Clean Room Team.

All communication between the Clean Room Team and either Post Office or the
remainder of the HNG-X development team shall be controlled by a Fujitsu Filter
Team. The responsibility of the Fujitsu Filter Team is to ensure that the terms of
reference for the Clean Room Team are not inadvertently compromised by the
inputs to it.

The Fujitsu Filter Team consists of a senior technical manager appointed by the
Fujitsu Services' HNG-X Programme Manager along with one or more assistants.
The Fujitsu Filter Team is part of the HNG-X project team outside the Clean Room
Team, and is responsible for the following:

11.3.1 Production of the Terms of Reference for the Ul and Postal Services
(CSRDE) Clean Room Teams, including synopsis / contents list for the UI
Style Guide, Counter Architecture and Interfaces;

11.3.2 Identification of individual Process Steps from the sample Post Office
Business Use Cases for prototyping of UI scenarios and CSRDE specific
Process Steps;

11.3.3 Recording and review of other Post Office and Fujitsu Services’ inputs to
the Clean Rooms;

11.3.4. Communicating any Fujitsu Services feedback to the Clean Room Team
and ensuring any feed back provided to the Clean Room Team relates only
to the above referenced inputs to the Clean Room and not to replication of
existing systems;

The Fujitsu Filter Team shall also raise any issues of concern, or refer any such
issues raised by the Clean Room Team to Fujitsu Services’ legal advisers.

All feedback correspondence originating from Fujitsu Services or Post Office
should include an identifier which clearly identifies the correspondence as
containing feedback intending to lead to a change in the outputs of the Clean
Room Team.

Fujitsu Services shall from time to time inform Post Office of the members of the
Fujitsu Filter Team and shall promptly upon each change to the Fujitsu Filter Team

personnel inform Post Office of that change.

SECTION D: RELATED POST OFFICE OBLIGATIONS

Post Office shall prepare its HNG-X Requirements in a format that where
reasonably possible avoids dictating a specific solution or design which in the
reasonable opinion of Post Office might infringe third party IPR.

Post Office shall as soon as reasonably practicable respond to reasonable
requests for information from Fujitsu Services aimed at establishing the bona fides
of any source of its HNG-X Requirement.

Post Office shall ensure that all its inputs for the Clean Room Team are submitted
via the Fujitsu Filter Team.

Post Office shall (at Fujitsu Services’ cost) take all steps reasonably requested by
Fujitsu Services to assist Fujitsu Services in establishing and operating its General
Development Team Rules or Clean Room Rules but only to the extent such steps
relate to the actions of Post Office's employees, agents or contractors under this
Agreement.

Post Office shall as soon as reasonably practicable notify Fujitsu Services of any
matters which come to its attention that might reasonably result in a breach by
Fujitsu Services of the General Development Team Rules or Clean Room Rules.

objective confirmation (or otherwise) of the fulfilment of Fujitsu Services’ delivery
obligations in respect of Project HNG-X and certain of the Associated Change Activities.
The process includes a mechanism for managing any and all rectification activities
identified in order to complete the fulfilment of any HNG-X Acceptance Criteria that have
not been met.
DEFINITIONS

Acceptance

2.1.1. The HNG-X Acceptance Process will enable Post Office and Fujitsu Services to
provide:

2.1.1.1 confirmation that the deliverables are fit to proceed to the next stage in
the HNG-X Acceptance Process; and

2.1.1.2 confirmation that Fujitsu Services has met the HNG-X Requirements,
and any related contractual obligations, in an agreed manner.

2.1.2 HNG-X Initial Acceptance will be achieved on progressing through HNG-X
Acceptance Gateway 4.

2.1.3. HNG-X Final Acceptance will be achieved once all HNG-X Acceptance
Gateways have been passed through.

HNG-X Acceptance Process Stages

2.2.1 A series of HNG-X Acceptance Gateways exists for the HNG-X Acceptance
Process. The HNG-X Acceptance Gateways are each numbered but such
numbering does not imply that the HNG-X Acceptance Gateways must be
achieved in strict sequential order. The series of numbered HNG-X Acceptance
Gateways for HNG-X is stated below, with the corresponding “Z#" point stated
alongside:

2.2.1.1 HNG-X Acceptance Gateway 1 - Readiness for Router Roll Out
(Acceptance Point 21);

2.2.1.2 HNG-X Acceptance Gateway 2 - Readiness for Data Centre Migration;

2.2.1.3 HNG-X Acceptance Gateway 3 — Readiness for Live Pilot (Acceptance
Point Z2);

2.2.1.6 HNG-X Acceptance Gateway 6 — End of Live Monitoring.

HNG-X Acceptance Gateways 1 and 2 must both be passed through as pre-
requisites for passing through HNG-X Acceptance Gateway 3. HNG-X
Acceptance Gateways 1 and 2 may be passed through in any order (the actual
order to be agreed and documented in the HNG-X Programme Plan).

Not Used.

A series of HNG-X Acceptance Process Stages exist, delineated by specific
HNG-X Acceptance Gateways as follows:

2.2.4.1 HNG-X Acceptance Process Stage “Test and Validation” is from delivery
of the agreed HNG-X Acceptance Plan to HNG-X Acceptance Gateway
3;

2.2.4.2 HNG-X Acceptance Process Stage “Live Pilot” is from HNG-X
Acceptance Gateway 3 to HNG-X Acceptance Gateway 4; and

2.2.4.3 HNG-X Acceptance Process Stage “Live Monitoring” is from HNG-X
Acceptance Gateway 4 to HNG-X Acceptance Gateway 6.

The HNG-X Acceptance Gateways and the HNG-X Acceptance Process Stages
can be represented diagrammatically as follows (HNG-X Acceptance Gateways

The HNG-X Acceptance Plan documents, inter alia, all the HNG-X Acceptance
Criteria and when they need to be achieved by. The HNG-X Acceptance
Process from AG4 to HNG-X Final Acceptance will be managed for Fujitsu
Services by its Post Office Account Service Management team.

‘The Fujitsu Services' Post Office Account Service Management team will
support the Fujitsu Services Acceptance Manager throughout the Live Pilot
stage by managing the provision of acceptance evidence in support of those
HNG-X Acceptance Criteria with the Acceptance Method of HNG-X Monitoring.

HNG-X Acceptance Criterion

2.3.4

2.3.2

2.3.3

2.3.4

An HNG-X Acceptance Criterion is a clear, objective and unambiguous
statement against which fulfilment (with supporting evidence) of an HNG-X
Requirement using an HNG-X Acceptance Method can be determined. There
will be one HNG-X Acceptance Criterion against each instance of an allocated
HNG-X Acceptance Method. There may be HNG-X Requirements that are, in
themselves, measurable and unambiguous. In such cases, the HNG-X
Acceptance Criterion may be marked ‘as per the HNG-X Requirement’. Where
the HNG-X Requirement is expressed as a Use Case, the HNG-X Acceptance
Criterion will be the fulfilment of the Use Case pre-conditions and post-
conditions or, subject to agreement between the HNG-X Acceptance Managers,
the HNG-X High Level Test Plans as detailed in the Test Automation Toolset and
associated with the relevant HNG-X Requirement, except where explicitly
stated.

HNG-X Acceptance Criteria will be documented by Post Office in DOORS and
extracted by Post Office into the HNG-X Requirements Catalogue at appropriate
points during Project HNG-X, including at the date of signature of CCN1200 and
at the end of the Requirements Stage.

Fujitsu Services is responsible for producing, within the timescale agreed
between the Parties, evidence to demonstrate that the relevant HNG-X
Acceptance Criterion has been met.

Further details of the presentation and status of HNG-X Acceptance Criteria are
set out in the table below:

HNG-X ACCEPTANCE
CRITERIA FOR:

Functional

Requirements (general)

Development approach Functional Requirements will be specified through Use
for HNG-X Acceptance Cases.

Criteria

Use Cases in themselves will not have HNG-X
Acceptance Methods and HNG-X Acceptance Criteria
as they are at a different level of specification and form
the starting point for test scripts. However, Use Cases
will each contain pre-conditions, minimal guarantees
and success guarantees, i.e. what is required to be true
before the Use Case is activated and what is expected
after the Use Case has been activated for both the main
flow and any variant paths.

Acceptance of each Use Case will therefore be fulfilled
when all paths have been exercised, and the pre-
conditions, minimal guarantees and success guarantees
or, subject to agreement between the HNG-X
Acceptance Managers, the tests associated with the
relevant HNG-X High Level Test Plan, have been met.
At the end of the Requirements Stage these will be
described within DOORS, and a _ version-controlled
extract will be provided by Post Office in the HNG-X
Requirements Catalogue, version 1. Further version-
controlled extracts shall be provided by Post Office
following any amendments to, or re-issuing of, HNG-X
Requirements in accordance with Schedule B6.1.

Position at the date of
signature of CCN1200

HNG-X Acceptance Criteria not available.

Functional
Requirements (Retained
Functionality)

Development approach
for HNG-X Acceptance
Criteria

Certain Functional Requirements will be expressed as
Retained Functionality Use Cases which are agreed not
to require main, variant and exception paths. They will
contain, as a minimum, a goal and a description and in
some cases more detail relating to Business Rules and
usage. Acceptance of these Retained Functionality Use
Cases will, as a minimum, be via the HNG-X
Acceptance Methods of HNG-X Solution Test and/or
HNG-X Release Validation and will require traditional
narrative HNG-X Acceptance Criterion statements or,
subject to agreement between the HNG-X Acceptance
Managers, HNG-X High Level Test Plans to be jointly
developed by Post Office and Fujitsu Services which
shall reference existing Horizon test materials where
relevant.

Development of HNG-X Acceptance Methods and HNG-
X Acceptance Criteria will not be complete for Retained

Functionality Use Cases by the end of the
Requirements Stage. These will be agreed by the joint
test teams following the end of the Requirements Stage
and, following such agreement, will be included in any
subsequent versions of the Requirements Baseline
issued by Post Office to Fujitsu Services.

Functional
Requirements (Postal
Services)

Development approach
for HNG-X Acceptance
Criteria

The approach to acceptance for Postal Services will be
as described for Functional Requirements (general)
except where HNG-X Requirements are provided in
narrative form and have narrative HNG-X Acceptance
Criteria.

Position at the date of
signature of CCN1200

The scope of Postal Services and the materials to be
provided at contract will be described in the CCD
entitled “Postal Services Business and Operational
Context” (REQ/CUS/BRS/0001).

Training Requirements

Development approach
for HNG-X Acceptance
Criteria

High level pre-contract HNG-X Acceptance Methods
and HNG-X Acceptance Criteria (in narrative form) to
support high level training requirements have been
created. These will be further developed after the date
of signature of CCN1200.

The position at the end of the Requirements Stage will
be that updated HNG-X Acceptance Criteria and HNG-X
Acceptance Methods will be provided by Post Office
within DOORS. A version-controlled extract will be
provided by Post Office in the HNG-X Requirements
Catalogue, version 1. Further version-controlled extracts
shall be provided by Post Office following any
amendments to, or re-issuing of, HNG-X Requirements
in accordance with Schedule B6.1.

Position at the date of
signature of CCN1200

HNG-X Acceptance Methods and HNG-X Acceptance
Criteria will be provided by Post Office within the HNG-X
Requirements Catalogue Draft at Contract. The HNG-X
Requirements Catalogue Draft at Contract will identify
which of these HNG-X Acceptance Methods and HNG-X
Acceptance Criteria have and have not been agreed
between the Parties at the date of signature of

CCN1200. Any such HNG-X Acceptance Methods and
HNG-X Acceptance Criteria not so agreed will be
documented as areas for agreement and detailed work
after the date of signature of CCN1200.

The User Interface

Development approach
for HNG-X Acceptance
Criteria

The functionality required to be supported by the HNG-
X User Interface will be derived from the Functional
Requirements generated through the Requirements
Definition Process. No HNG-X Acceptance Criteria or
HNG-X Acceptance Methods are required to additionally
and specifically accept these HNG-X Requirements in
terms of their presence within the HNG-X User Interface
as this is a fundamental pre-requisite to testing for
acceptance of the Functional Requirement.

Non-functional HNG-X Requirements for the HNG-X
User Interface will be created in the traditional narrative
style and will include HNG-X Acceptance Criteria and
HNG-X Acceptance Methods. A high level view of the
acceptance events which relate to these HNG-X
Requirements are described in the CCD entitled
“Establishing and Assuring the HNG-X User Interface”
(REQ/GEN/PRD/0001).

date of signature of CCN1200 and will be areas for
agreement and detailed work after that date.

24 HNG-X Acceptance Methods

24.1

2.4.3

2.4.4

HNG-X Acceptance Methods are an agreed set of pre-defined techniques by
which HNG-X Requirements can be objectively measured as fulfilled or not,
each against one or more agreed HNG-X Acceptance Criteria. HNG-X
Acceptance Methods are described in more detail at Annex C to this Schedule.

2.4.2 In general, an HNG-X Requirement will be allocated one or more HNG-
X Acceptance Methods. The objectives in allocating HNG-X Acceptance
Method(s) to HNG-X Requirements are to progress toward overall HNG-
X Final Acceptance as efficiently as possible, but subject to also being
able to identify and resolve defects (non-compliances) as early as
possible in the HNG-X Acceptance Process, to reduce overall
development costs and risks.

In summary, the relationships are:

2.4.3.1 each HNG-X Requirement will have one or more HNG-X Acceptance
Methods; and

2.4.3.2 each HNG-X Acceptance Method for an HNG-X Requirement will have
one HNG-X Acceptance Criterion.

The agreed HNG-X Acceptance Method(s) allocated against each HNG-X
Requirement will be documented by Post Office in DOORS and extracted by
Post Office into the HNG-X Requirements Catalogue.

25 HNG-X Acceptance Tracking

25.1

25.2

HNG-X Acceptance Tracking will be achieved through the production of a single
HNG-X Acceptance Tracking report that will be initially derived from the HNG-X
Requirements. During the HNG-X Acceptance Process, the Acceptance status
of the HNG-X Requirements will be recorded in the Test Automation Toolset and
will be incrementally updated with the outcomes of the various activities that
form part of the HNG-X Acceptance Process.

The acceptance status of the HNG-X Requirements will be maintained by Post
Office and shared with Fujitsu Services.

26 HNG-X High Level Test Plans

HNG-X High Level Test Plans (HNG-X HLTPs) identify those functions and conditions
that are mapped against the HNG-X Acceptance Criteria and that are required to

support the HNG-X Acceptance Process. HNG-X HLTPs will be produced by Post Office
or Fujitsu Services in accordance with HNG-X Programme Plan and are subject to joint
review.

HNG-X Acceptance Incident

An HNG-X Acceptance Incident is raised when the HNG-X Acceptance Method fails to
prove that an HNG-X Acceptance Criterion has been met. HNG-X Acceptance Incidents
are classified according to Annex A to this Schedule.

HNG-X Minor Concession

Where the evidence fails to prove that an HNG-X Acceptance Criterion has been met,
Fujitsu Services may request Post Office to grant an HNG-X Minor Concession on the
basis that the failure of compliance or the deviation from the stated HNG-X Requirement
presents no adverse impact to Post Office. In all such cases a defect shall be raised and
if Post Office agrees to grant an HNG-X Minor Concession, details of the failure of
compliance or the deviation from the stated HNG-X Requirements shall be recorded by
Post Office and linked to the relevant HNG-X Requirement. Confirmation that all such
details have been recorded by Post Office shall allow the defect to be closed and the
HNG-X Requirements shall be deemed to have been satisfied providing that there are
no additional test(s) associated with the HNG-X Requirement that have either not been
run or failed for a different reason.

Should Post Office refuse to grant an HNG-X Minor Concession, the failure of
compliance or deviation from the stated HNG-X Requirement shall be rectified through a
defect management process agreed by the HNG-X Acceptance Board.

Following the granting of an HNG-X Minor Concession, should Post Office identify any
unexpected consequences that have arisen as a direct result of an HNG-X Minor
Concession then they shall be treated as an incident, and a date for resolution and
rectification measures agreed through the HNG-X Acceptance Board, but will not be
classified as an HNG-X Acceptance incident for acceptance purposes. This shall apply
up until HNG-X Final Acceptance after which no further Incidents arising from any HNG-
X Minor Concessions shall be raised.

The Post Office shall maintain a register of all HNG-X Minor Concessions and shall
periodically share with Fujitsu Services details of all HNG-X Minor Concessions that

have been granted.

HNG-X Acceptance Incident Collection

An HNG-X Acceptance Incident Collection is a facility in PEAK whereby fault reports
deemed to be HNG-X Acceptance Incidents will be grouped for management and
reporting purposes.

For the purposes of the HNG-X Acceptance Process, an ' HNG-X Acceptance Dispute’
is defined in paragraph 7.1. An HNG-X Acceptance Dispute is not a Dispute in the
broader context of the overall Agreement between Post Office and Fujitsu Services.

HNG-X Acceptance Plan

The HNG-X Acceptance Plan will define which HNG-X Acceptance Criteria will be
assessed during which HNG-X Acceptance Process Stage. This plan will be produced
by the Post Office HNG-X Acceptance Manager and agreed by the Fujitsu Services’
HNG-X Acceptance Manager, such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld.

HNG-X ACCEPTANCE PROCESS

Roles and Responsibilities
3.1.1. HNG-X Acceptance Manager

The primary responsibility for managing the HNG-X Acceptance Process rests
with the HNG-X Acceptance Managers. This may be a specified
individual or, more likely, a role adopted by the respective HNG-X
Programme Managers.

3.1.2 I HNG-X Acceptance Board

An HNG-X Acceptance Board will be nominated and the primary function of this
board shall be to assess and agree the acceptance status of the HNG-X
Acceptance Criteria associated with the relevant HNG-X Acceptance
Gateway. The Fujitsu and Post Office HNG-X Acceptance Managers
shall prepare material for assessment by the HNG-X Acceptance Board
from which the HNG-X Acceptance Board shall provide a
recommendation to the ‘Joint Release Authorisation Board’ concerning
progression through the relevant HNG-X Acceptance Gateway.

The HNG-X Acceptance Board shall be constituted, deal with matters and meet
at intervals as set out in Schedule A2.

3.1.3 HNG-X Acceptance Dispute Board

An HNG-X Acceptance Dispute Board will be nominated and the primary
function of this board shall be to settle any HNG-X Acceptance Disputes that
cannot be resolved by the HNG-X Acceptance Managers. The HNG-X
Acceptance Dispute Board shall be constituted, deal with the matters and meet
at the intervals as set out in Schedule A2.

Changes to the Agreement

3.2.1 After the end of the HNG-X Requirements Baselining Process and prior to HNG-
X Final Acceptance, where either Party requests a change to any provision of
this Agreement relating to HNG-X Requirements or the HNG-X solution, the
Change Control Procedure will be followed and both Fujitsu Services and Post

3.2.2

3.2.3

Office will review the HNG-X Acceptance Criteria to determine whether any
changes are required. Such changes may include:

3.2.1.1 deletion of HNG-X Acceptance Criteria that were derived from deleted
provisions;

3.2.1.2 addition of new HNG-X Acceptance Criteria relating to new or extended
provisions; and/or

3.2.1.3 modification of HNG-X Acceptance Criteria relating to changed
provisions.

If changes are made to tests that are already in progress or have been
completed then, unless both Parties agree otherwise, or the results of those
changed tests can be derived from the results of tests already carried out, those
tests shall be repeated.

Within 60 days of Final Acceptance, Fujitsu Services shall present to Post Office
a CCN to incorporate all Minor Concessions continuing to have an impact after
Final Acceptance into the relevant requirements. This shall allow a clear
requirements baseline for the HNG-X Release.

4 PROGRESSING THROUGH THE HNG-X ACCEPTANCE PROCESS

44 Paragraph 2.2.4 identifies the three key stages during which the HNG-X Acceptance
Process takes place, namely Test and Validation, Live Pilot and Live Monitoring.
Progression from one stage to the next is controlled by an HNG-X Acceptance Gateway
that has to be passed through.

42 HNG-X Acceptance Gateways have parameters associated with them that are
configured to meet the specific arrangements agreed between Post Office and Fujitsu
Services. The parameters are:

4.2.1

4.2.2

4.2.3

4.2.4

as detailed in paragraph 4.6;
the number and status of HNG-X High Severity Acceptance Incidents;
the number and status of HNG-X Medium Severity Acceptance Incidents; and

the number and status of HNG-X Low Severity Acceptance Incidents.

43 The three key HNG-X Acceptance Gateways controlling progression through the HNG-X
Acceptance Process Stages are HNG-X Acceptance Gateways 3, 4 and 6 respectively
as described in paragraph 4.5.

Gateway 2 (named “Readiness for Data Centre Migration”) must
be completed and these two HNG-X Acceptance Gateways
passed through in accordance with paragraph 4.5.4.2 as pre-
requisites to achieve HNG-X Acceptance Gateway 3. Failure to
progress through HNG-X Acceptance Gateway 1 and HNG-X
Acceptance Gateway 2 will not prohibit any other programme
activities from continuing prior to HNG-X Acceptance Gateway

Parties agree do not require a workaround.

4.5.1.2 Notwithstanding progression through HNG-X Acceptance Gateway 3 in
accordance with paragraph 4.5.1.1, Live Pilot shall not commence until
confirmation that it may do so is given in writing to Fujitsu Services by
the Post Office Release Authorisation Board.

the earliest planned date as specified in the HNG-X Programme
Plan for completion of Live Monitoring has occurred;

subject to paragraph 4.6, all HNG-X Acceptance Criteria
allocated to Live Monitoring as set out in the HNG-X Acceptance
Plan have been achieved;

there are no outstanding HNG-X High Severity Acceptance
Incidents;

the number of outstanding HNG-X Medium Severity Acceptance
Incidents arising from HNG-X Acceptance Criteria scheduled to
be achieved during Live Monitoring is two or fewer. For the
avoidance of doubt, this means that the total number of HNG-X
Medium Severity Acceptance Incidents at this HNG-X
Acceptance Gateway (including those outstanding from previous
HNG-X Acceptance Gateways) could be seven. However, this
total of seven would be reduced if any of the original HNG-X
Medium Severity Acceptance Incidents have been closed in
accordance with their agreed HNG-X Rectification Plans;

each HNG-X Medium Severity Acceptance Incident has an
agreed workaround and, subject to paragraph 6.4.2, an agreed
HNG-X Rectification Plan; and

each HNG-X Low Severity Acceptance Incident has, subject to
paragraph 6.4.4, a target timescale for rectification and has an

been achieved;

(b) there are no outstanding HNG-X High Severity Acceptance Incidents;

(c) the number of outstanding HNG-X Medium Severity Acceptance
Incidents, together with any related HNG-X Rectification Plans or
agreed workarounds, are agreed between the Parties as being
acceptable to progress through the HNG-X Acceptance Gateway; and

4.6.2

4.6.3

If the Parties do not agree whether HNG-X Final Acceptance, HNG-X Stage
Progression or progression through HNG-X Acceptance Gateways 1 and 2 has
occurred, the matter will be resolved through the procedure described in
paragraph 7 for resolving HNG-X Acceptance Disputes.

If, following investigation by Fujitsu Services, an HNG-X Acceptance Incident is
found to have been caused solely by a fault or deficiency in anything other than
those elements of HNG-X provided by Fujitsu Services, it shall not count
towards the thresholds identified in paragraph 4.5.

HNG-X Acceptance Incidents that are agreed to result from the same failure or
deficiency, or to affect the same operational process or business function, may
be aggregated into a single HNG-X Acceptance Incident for the purposes of the
thresholds identified in paragraph 4.5.

The aggregation of two or more HNG-X Acceptance Incidents into a single
HNG-X Acceptance Incident shall be proposed by the Fujitsu HNG-X
Acceptance Manager and agreed by the Post Office HNG-X Acceptance
Manager, such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld.

If, other than as a result of a Default of Fujitsu Services, it is impossible for a
test to be carried out when scheduled in the HNG-X Acceptance Plan then that
test becomes known as a "Deferred Test". Deferred Tests will be carried out as
soon as reasonably practicable or at such later time as the Parties may agree
(which shall be no later than six months after HNG-X Final Acceptance)
provided that performance on that agreed date does not, other than as a result
of a Default of Fujitsu Services, become impossible (in which event the Deferred
Test shall be carried out as soon as reasonably practicable).

The non-occurrence of a Deferred Test at the time originally scheduled in the
HNG-X Acceptance Plan will not prevent HNG-X Stage Progression, HNG-X
Final Acceptance or progression through HNG-X Acceptance Gateways 1 and 2
each of which will be assessed on the basis of:

4.6.5.1 those tests scheduled to take place for that HNG-X Stage Progression,
HNG-X Final Acceptance or progression through HNG-X Acceptance
Gateways 1 and 2, as the case may be, which are not Deferred Tests;
and

4.6.5.2 those Deferred Tests which were originally scheduled to take place as
part of a previous HNG-X Stage Progression, HNG-X Final Acceptance
or progression through HNG-X Acceptance Gateways 1 and 2 and
which have been rescheduled in accordance with paragraph 4.6.4 to
take place for that HNG-X Stage Progression, HNG-X Final Acceptance
or progression through HNG-X Acceptance Gateways 1, 2 or 5.

If, when a Deferred Test is carried out after HNG-X Final Acceptance, it is not
successfully completed, that failure shall not of itself constitute a Default under
the Agreement or entitle Post Office to raise an HNG-X Acceptance Incident.

Where a test that was originally scheduled to be carried out by Fujitsu Services
in the Solution Test Stage becomes a Deferred Test in accordance with
paragraph 4.6.4, the failure of Fujitsu Services to carry out that Deferred Test in
accordance with paragraph 4.6.4 shall constitute a Default under the
Agreement.

Other than as set out in paragraph 4.6.6, nothing in paragraph 4.6 shall reduce
or alter any obligations of Fujitsu Services under this Agreement.

5. HANDLING HNG-X ACCEPTANCE TESTING EVIDENCE

51 Evidence (including, without limitation, test results, test observations, data or other
information) provided by Fujitsu Services for review in relation to fulfilment of HNG-X
Acceptance Criteria ("HNG-X Acceptance Testing Evidence") shall by default be
available to all Post Office employees and contractors unless such evidence is:

5.1.1

Confidential Information, in which case disclosure shall be governed by the
provisions of Clause 61 of the Agreement; or

5.1.2 considered to be or categorised as sensitive in accordance with paragraphs 5.2
or 5.3 of this Schedule, in which case disclosure will be governed by those
provisions (as applicable).

HNG-X Acceptance Testing Evidence that can reasonably be considered to be
particularly sensitive because access to such information could compromise the security
of the HNG-X or other Post Office Services will be restricted to named employees or
contractors of Post Office who will be nominated by Post Office to review it on Post
Office's behalf. Access to the information will be in accordance with such reasonable
conditions as may be imposed by Fujitsu Services.

Subject to paragraph 5.4, HNG-X Acceptance Testing Evidence categorised by Fujitsu
Services (acting reasonably) as particularly commercially sensitive to Fujitsu Services
will only be disclosed to named employees or contractors of Post Office (such named
individuals to be approved by Fujitsu Services). Post Office will place such named
employees and contractors under a duty to keep confidential and not disclose Fujitsu
Services’ commercially sensitive information to any other person or Party without Fujitsu
Services’ prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed).

Fujitsu Services will not be entitled to categorise any HNG-X Acceptance Testing
Evidence as commercially sensitive where that evidence solely reflects a visible
manifestation or result of the operation of the HNG-X System, as opposed to how the
HNG-X System achieves that manifestation or result.

Sensitive information disclosed as HNG-X Acceptance Testing Evidence pursuant to
paragraphs 5.3 or 5.4 may also be disclosed by Post Office or Fujitsu Services to the
HNG-X Acceptance Board if such disclosure is necessary for the resolution of an HNG-
X Acceptance Dispute.

At Post Office's request Fujitsu Services will supply supporting evidence for the
completion of a test that can reasonably be regarded as necessary for Post Office to
validate whether the HNG-X Acceptance Criteria for that test have been met.

MANAGING HNG-X ACCEPTANCE INCIDENTS

Raising HNG-X Acceptance Incidents

6.1.1. An HNG-X Acceptance Incident will be raised by Fujitsu Services when the
HNG-X Acceptance Method used fails to prove that the HNG-X Acceptance
Criterion has been met. In addition, Fujitsu Services will report to Post Office
any material undesirable occurrences, which are not HNG-X Acceptance
Incidents, observed by it whilst conducting tests.

6.1.2 Post Office may raise an HNG-X Acceptance Incident whenever Post Office
becomes aware of evidence that (a) any of the occurrences referred to in
paragraph 6.1.1 have arisen (b) the HNG-X Acceptance Criteria are not being
met or (c) the introduction of changes arising from Project HNG-X and/or the
Associated Change Activities that are subject to the HNG-X Acceptance
Process has resulted or might reasonably be expected to result in the existing

Schedule B6.3 Version 14.0
Page 16 of 23

FUJ00234786
FUJ00234786
CONFIDENTIAL

6.1.3

Horizon Applications or the Horizon Service Infrastructure no longer functioning
or being performed (as the case may be) in accordance with the provisions of
the Agreement.

Where the HNG-X Requirements Catalogue or Annex 2 of Schedule B6.1
expressly states that the application will not permit specified functions or
activities or cause certain specified behaviour, and those functions, activities or
behaviour are observed to occur during testing of the application, then the
observing Party will (in the case of Fujitsu Services) or may (in the case of Post
Office) raise an HNG-X Acceptance Incident.

Following resolution of an HNG-X Acceptance Incident raised in accordance
with paragraph 6.1.1, 6.1.2 or 6.1.3, a further HNG-X Acceptance Incident can
be raised in accordance with paragraph 6.1.1 if the applicable functions,
activities or behaviour are observed to occur again.

Each Party will raise an HNG-X Acceptance Incident as soon as reasonably
practicable after becoming aware of such incident. However, HNG-X
Acceptance Incidents may not be raised in respect of any HNG-X Acceptance
Criteria before commencement of the testing or assessment of those HNG-X
Acceptance Criteria in accordance with the HNG-X Acceptance Plan. Once
HNG-X Final Acceptance has occurred no new HNG-X Acceptance Incidents
may be raised. For the purposes of this paragraph a "new HNG-X Acceptance
Incident" means an HNG-X Acceptance Incident that occurs after the HNG-X
Final Acceptance Date or which occurs on or before that date, but is not
reported to Fujitsu Services before the HNG-X Final Acceptance Date. Once
HNG-X Initial Acceptance has occurred no additional HNG-X Acceptance
Incidents will be classified as HNG-X Acceptance Incidents in respect of HNG-X.
Initial Acceptance.

An HNG-X Acceptance Incident manifests itself as one or more defects
originating from either the Test Automation Toolset or PEAK. Such defects will
be allocated to HNG-X Acceptance Incidents following review and agreement by
the HNG-X Acceptance Managers from both Parties.

A PEAK fault report that is allocated to the HNG-X Acceptance Incident
Collection can only be closed with the agreement of both HNG-X Acceptance
Managers.

If a dispute arises whereby the HNG-X Acceptance Managers cannot agree as
to the status of a defect associated with an HNG-X Acceptance Incident, the
matter will be escalated according to the procedure described in paragraph 7 for
resolving HNG-X Acceptance Disputes...

62 Analysing and Classifying HNG-X Acceptance Incidents

6.2.1

HNG-X Acceptance Incidents will be jointly analysed by Fujitsu Services and
Post Office and a written report produced which will record:

Page 17 of 23

FUJ00234786

6.2.2

6.2.3

6.2.4

6.2.1.1 initially, the agreed (such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld by
either Party) severity classification of the HNG-X Acceptance Incident as
identified in Annex A to this Schedule; and subsequently

6.2.1.2 related rectification activities (if applicable); and
6.2.1.3 re-testing dates/periods (if applicable).

This information will be included in the test report issued at the time of
completing the HNG-X Acceptance Process Stage during which the HNG-X
Acceptance Incident was raised.

For the purpose of paragraph 6.2.1, an HNG-X Acceptance Incident will be
regarded as having been caused by the introduction of changes arising from
Project HNG-X and/or the Associated Change Activities that are subject to the
HNG-X Acceptance Process:

6.2.2.1 if that incident is identified during any of the HNG-X Acceptance Process
Stages; and

6.2.2.2 where the behaviour of Horizon giving rise to that incident (i) has not
been previously observed, or (ii) had been previously observed in
relation to the Horizon Service Infrastructure or the Horizon Application
but such behaviour had been resolved prior to commencement of
testing of HNG-X,

unless following investigation by Fujitsu Services, that incident is found to be
unrelated to the introduction of changes arising from Project HNG-X
and/or the Associated Change Activities that are subject to the HNG-X
Acceptance Process and Fujitsu Services has provided Post Office with
reasonable evidence to demonstrate this.

Where an HNG-X Acceptance Incident can be attributed to faults in HNG-X, the
severity of that incident (for the purposes of HNG-X Final Acceptance and HNG-
X Initial Acceptance) shall be classified with reference to the fault in HNG-X
alone.

Either Party may request that the severity of an HNG-X Acceptance Incident be
re-classified in recognition of new evidence or if it is reasonably believed that
the impact of the HNG-X Acceptance Incident should be re-assessed.
Agreement to such requested re-classification shall not be unreasonably
withheld by either Party.

6.3 Repeat Acceptance Activities

6.3.1

Any failed test may, prior to the end of the agreed Live Monitoring be repeated
as many times as necessary in order for HNG-X Final Acceptance to be
achieved. Dates for such repeat tests will be agreed by the joint test teams
having regard to the overall HNG-X Programme Plan. Post Office will be
responsible for making personnel available to observe repeat testing if required.

6.3.2

Repeat tests will be proposed only when it is reasonably believed a different (i.e.
improved) outcome would result.

In the case of repeated HNG-X Document Reviews, HNG-X Design
Walkthroughs or HNG-X Monitoring, Post Office will be entitled to the same
elapsed time for the repeated activity as was scheduled for the original failed
activity. Repeat HNG-X Document Reviews or HNG-X Design Walkthroughs will
be proposed only when it is reasonably believed a different (i.e. improved)
outcome would result.

6.4 HNG-X Rectification Plan

6.4.1

6.4.3

6.4.4

For each HNG-X Medium Severity Acceptance Incident outstanding on the
HNG-X Initial Acceptance Date or on the HNG-X Final Acceptance Date, Fujitsu
Services will have prepared a written HNG-X Rectification Plan that includes:

6.4.1.1 a statement of the operational impact and any necessary temporary
procedures to be adopted by Users;

6.4.1.2 a description of how rectification is to be achieved; and
6.4.1.3 a timetable for rectification.

Post Office shall not unreasonably withhold its agreement to any such HNG-X
Rectification Plan and neither Party shall unreasonably withhold its agreement
to any workaround referred to in this Schedule.

It is acknowledged by the Parties that exceptionally they may agree that such a
HNG-X Rectification Plan is not required for each outstanding HNG-X Medium
Severity Acceptance Incident.

For each HNG-X Low Severity Acceptance Incident outstanding on the HNG-X
Initial Acceptance Date or on the HNG-X Final Acceptance Date, Fujitsu
Services will identify a target timescale for rectification.

It is acknowledged by the Parties that they may agree that such a target
timescale for rectification is not required for each outstanding HNG-X Low
Severity Acceptance Incident.

SCHEDULE C1

SERVICE LEVEL PRINCIPLES AND REMEDIES

INTRODUCTION
This Schedule sets out the Service Level principles and remedies that apply.
This Schedule defines up to three thresholds in respect of each Service Level as follows:

1.2.1 the level of Service (“Service Level Target” or “SLT”) required from Fujitsu
Services by Post Office;

1.2.2 the level of Service which, if not achieved by Fujitsu Services, shall give rise to
payment of liquidated damages by Fujitsu Services (the “Liquidated Damage
Threshold” or “LDT”). Payment of liquidated damages notwithstanding, a failure
of any LDT shall not (on its own) constitute a Default; and

1.2.3 the level of Service below the SLT and (if applicable) the LDT which if not
achieved by Fujitsu Services shall give rise to payment by Fujitsu Services of
Post Office's Additional Costs or liquidated damages as described (where
relevant) in this Schedule and each relevant Service Description (the “Additional
Remedy Level’ or “ARL").

For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties agree that not all SLT failures shall give rise to
payment of liquidated damages. The SLT failures that do not give rise to payment of
liquidated damages are set out in each relevant Service Description.

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

The purpose of remedies (liquidated damages or any other additional remedy specified
in a Service Description) is that Post Office shall not be disadvantaged by failures of
Fujitsu Services to provide the HNG-X Services to the agreed specification and reliability.

For the avoidance of doubt, liquidated damages shall be based upon the applicable fixed
amounts or rates stated in the relevant Service Descriptions.

The performance of the HNG-X Services (other than the BCSF Service) against the SLT,
LDT and ARL applicable in respect of each Service Level shall be measured and reported
and success or failure against each shall be judged over Service Level Measurement
Periods defined for each HNG-X Service (other than the BCSF Service). Additionally, all
levels of service shall be monitored on a weekly and monthly basis and any failure to
meet a Service Level assessed over that month shall be reported to Post Office by means
of the Service Review Book produced on a monthly basis detailing all Service Levels and
the actual levels of service achieved during that month.

In respect of any SLT that has a Service Level Measurement Period equivalent to a SLT
Calendar Year or a Service Level Measurement Period that is otherwise defined with
reference to a SLT Calendar Year, in the event that the remainder of the term of the
Agreement after the last SLT Calendar Year of the term of the Agreement in relation to
that SLT (“Final Period”) is less than six (6) months then Fujitsu Services shall:

2.4.1. continue to measure and report performance against that SLT during the Final
Period; and

2.5.2 not be obliged to take any remedial action should that SLT fail to be achieved at
any time during the Final Period.

The values applicable to each SLT are set out in the relevant Service Description.

Subject to any provisions to the contrary in a Service Description in respect of a particular
Service Level, where Service Levels are expressed in terms of performance required by a
particular “Day”:

2.6.1 “Day A” means the day of the specified triggering event (such as the date of a
Transaction);

2.6.2 “Day B” means the day following Day A; and
2.6.3 “Day C” means the day following Day B and so on.

Liquidated Damages

2.7.1. Removed by CCN1623b.
2.7.2 Removed by CCN1623b.

2.7.3 The aggregate limit on Fujitsu Services’ liability referred to in Clause 44.4 shall
apply.

If the Parties agree to suspend any of the Services in accordance with the CCD entitled
"Service Level Target & Liquidated Damages Exclusions" (SVM/SDM/PRO/0006),
Fujitsu Services shall, for the period of such suspension, be released from its
obligation to comply with any Service Levels and/or LDTs to the extent they relate to
the suspended Service(s), save where the suspension is due to Fujitsu Services
Default.

Termination

2.9.1 For the purpose of Clause 47.2 of the Agreement, any breach of a Service Level
Target for the Payment and Banking Service shall only be considered a material
or persistent Default when the Service Points Threshold has been reached. The
“Service Point Threshold” shall be the accumulation of twenty (20) or more
Service Points in any three (3) Reporting Periods over a rolling six (6) month
period.

define the SLTs, LDTs and ARLs.

Save as provided in paragraph 6.1 of Schedule C1 the provisions of this Schedule C1
shall otherwise not apply to the Superstock Solution.

The Parties shall meet on an annual basis to review the SLTs for Payment and Banking
Service for the preceding twelve (12) month period and may agree to adjust the SLTs in
accordance with the Change Control Procedure in order to improve performance of the
Payment and Banking Service.

SERVICE LEVEL RELIEF — VOLUMETRIC LIMITS

Where appropriate each Service Description sets out the limits for an HNG-X Service (the
“Volumetric Limits”) which if exceeded over a specified period (the “Relevant Period”)
will entitle Fujitsu Services to adjust the measurements of performance in respect of the
Service Levels (SLTs and (if applicable) the LDTs and ARLs) affected by that excess (the
“Affected Service Levels”). Such adjustment, where applicable, shall be made on the
basis set out in the relevant Service Description.

SERVICE LEVEL/OBLIGATION RELIEF - BUSINESS VOLUMES CCD

The CCD entitled “Horizon Capacity Management and Business Volumes” (PA/PER/033)
(the “Business Volumes CCD") defines various limits on numbers of Transactions or
instances of Service as “Contracted Volumes” or “Design Limits” for Point of Sale
Business Capability, In/Out Payment Business Capability, Cash and Stock Management
Business Capability, Message Broadcast Service, Reference Data Management Service,
Banking Business Capability, Payment Management Business Capability and on-line
Transactions.

On each day that any of the Contracted Volumes referred to in the Business Volumes
CCD is exceeded, the measures of Fujitsu Services’ performance for the Service Levels
(SLTs and (if applicable) the LDTs and ARLs) listed in the Business Volumes CCD shall
be disregarded and replaced with an average measurement for that day (based upon
actual performance measurements over the previous three calendar months, or otherwise
as agreed by the Parties (acting reasonably).

If the Contracted Volumes referred to in the Business Volumes CCD are exceeded, Post
Office and Fujitsu Services shall jointly consider the reasons for such excess and whether
it is temporary or is or is likely to be continuing. If such excess is or is likely to be
continuing Fujitsu Services shall be entitled to make a reasonable and proportionate
adjustment to the relevant Contracted Volume and/or the affected Service Levels or
obligations specified in the Business Volumes CCD, such adjustment to be agreed with
Post Office under the Change Control Procedure.

If any of the Design Limits specified in the Business Volumes CCD are exceeded then
the measures of Fujitsu Services' performance for any Service Level or other service

target involving data processing (requiring either automated or manual processing or
both) shall be disregarded to the extent that Fujitsu Services can demonstrate to Post
Office's satisfaction (Post Office acting reasonably) that failure to meet the Service Level
and/or service target, as the case may be, occurred as a result of a Design Limit being
exceeded. Fujitsu Services shall use reasonable endeavours to meet those Service
Levels and/or service targets during the period when the measures of Fujitsu Services’
performance are disregarded.

OTHER SERVICE LEVEL/OBLIGATION RELIEF

The Parties shall agree (such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld) appropriate
relief from Service Levels if any new facilities or products introduced, by agreement, with
less testing than would otherwise be required to safeguard Fujitsu Services' position.

For the periods in which any of the Business Capabilities and/or Support Facilities are
suspended in accordance with paragraph 2.8 of the CCD entitled “Service Management
Service: Service Description” (SVM/SDM/SD/0007), measurements of Fujitsu Services’
performance in respect of all Service Levels detrimentally affected by such suspension
(in respect of those Business Capabilities and/or Support Facilities) shall be disregarded
and Fujitsu Services shall be released from those of its obligations in respect of those
Business Capabilities and/or Support Facilities which it is unable to perform as a result of
such suspension.

If Fujitsu Services fails to achieve any Service Level or service target (as the case may
be) and can demonstrate to Post Office's reasonable satisfaction that such failure
occurred as a result of a fault or problem within the QAS Software, such fault or problem
requiring the Third Line Software Support Service or Application Support Service (Fourth
Line) in order to be resolved, then the measures of Fujitsu Services’ performance in
respect of such Service Level and other service target shall be disregarded for the period
affected by the QAS Software fault or problem.

RECTIFICATION PLAN

In the event that an ARL specified in the relevant Service Description is failed, Fujitsu
Services and Post Office shall agree a method of rectification and timetable for the
resolution of the cause of that failure (a “Rectification Plan”). For the avoidance of doubt,
Fujitsu Services shall remain liable for financial remedies payable in accordance with the
Service Description in respect of that failure.

In the event that the Rectification Plan involves a change to the provision of the Services,
such change shall be agreed under the Change Control Procedure and shall be made at
no charge to Post Office.

Without prejudice to Post Office's rights to remedies provided in this Agreement, during
the period the Rectification Plan is being implemented Fujitsu Services shall maintain
performance of all other Services in accordance with the Service Levels specified in each
relevant Service Description unless otherwise agreed with Post Office as part of the
Rectification Plan.

74 In the event that the Rectification Plan is not agreed by the Parties (acting reasonably)
within three (3) calendar months of the occurrence of an ARL failure or the Rectification
Plan fails to resolve the cause of the ARL failure to which it relates, such that the ARL
failure occurs again and is persistent, the following provisions shall apply:

74.4

7.4.2

74.3

Post Office shall have the right to conduct, and require Fujitsu Services to co-
operate and assist with (including by Fujitsu Services providing such information
as it would have been required to under paragraph 6.6 of Schedule D6), a tender
process for sub-contracting by Fujitsu Services of the Operational Services in
relation to which the ARL failure has occurred (and where the ARL failure has
occurred in relation to an Operational Service which, together with one or more
other Operational Services, constitutes a Testable Service, such Operational
Services will be tendered together) to an alternative service provider at Fujitsu
Services' cost (the “Service Provider’). If the Parties agree that it would be more
appropriate for Fujitsu Services to conduct, and Post Office to co-operate with,
the tender process, then the Parties shall procure the same.

Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, Fujitsu Services shall disclose
to any bona fide potential Service Provider (subject to the same executing an
Agreed Form NDA or any other form of non-disclosure agreement mutually
agreed by Post Office, Fujitsu Services and such bona fide potential Service
Provider) Confidential Information to the extent that such disclosure is reasonably
required to enable any potential Service Provider to prepare a reasonably
detailed tender proposal.

If the outcome of any tender process is that Fujitsu Services were to sub-contract
the Operational Services in question (and where the ARL failure has occurred in
relation to an Operational Service which, together with one or more other
Operational Services, constitutes a Testable Service, such Operational Services
will be tendered together) to a Service Provider identified in the tender process,
the performance in respect of the failed ARL for that Operational Service (and
where the ARL failure has occurred in relation to an Operational Service which,
together with one or more other Operational Services, constitutes a Testable
Service, such Operational Services will be tendered together) would be improved
then Post Office shall have the right to require Fujitsu Services to sub-contract
such Operational Service (and where the ARL failure has occurred in relation to
an Operational Service which, together with one or more other Operational
Services, constitutes a Testable Service, such Operational Services will be
tendered together) to such Service Provider at no higher cost to Post Office than
was previously the case.

be upgraded to an alternative operating system, then whichever Party acquires the
licences for that upgrade, the appropriate licensing terms will be agreed by the Parties
and the Agreement amended under the Change Control Procedure to reflect these terms.

In the event that:

1.1.1 the licence terms agreed pursuant to paragraph 1.4 involve Post Office or any
other member of the Royal Mail Group (any such member being for the purposes
of this paragraph 1.5 “the relevant Post Office company”) procuring the operating
system third party software listed in table 3 below from the provider of that
software;

1.1.2 the terms of the licence agreement provide, or an arrangement between the
Parties exists, that Fujitsu Services pays to the software provider the charges
payable under the licence agreement; and

1.1.3 the terms of the licence agreement provide that the relevant Post Office company
is ultimately responsible or in any way liable for the charges payable under that
agreement,

then to the extent that Fujitsu Services determines not to pay, or fails to pay, any amounts
in respect of the software provider's charges by the due date for payment (“Unpaid
Amounts’), Fujitsu Services shall:

1.1.3.1 forthwith provide to Post Office in writing a reasonably detailed explanation as to why

Confidential Information” shall be kept in strictest confidence and not disclosed
to any party except as permitted under this paragraph 2 of Schedule C3 and
paragraph 2 of Schedule B4.1.

Escher Confidential Information shall not comprise Confidential Information for
the purposes of this Agreement and, accordingly, the provisions of Clause 61
shall not apply to Escher Confidential Information.

Post Office shall:

(a) take all reasonable precautions to protect the confidentiality of
Escher Confidential Information;

(b) not duplicate or reproduce Escher Confidential Information
except as necessary for the purposes of this Agreement; and

(c) upon termination of the Existing Licences, immediately return to
Fujitsu Services all documents and other materials which

The non-disclosure and confidentiality provisions contained in this paragraph 2
of this Schedule C3 will survive the termination of any or all of its other provisions
but shall expire 20 years after the expiry or termination of this Agreement. Post
Office acknowledges and agrees that Fujitsu Services and any third party are, in
addition to other remedies, entitled to seek an injunction to prevent Post Office
from disclosing Escher Confidential Information in breach of this paragraph 2 of
this Schedule C3 and/or paragraph 2 of Schedule B4.1.

Post Office may with Fujitsu Services' written consent disclose Escher
Confidential Information to third parties. If Fujitsu Services agrees to allow Post
Office to disclose Escher Confidential Information to a third party, prior to making
any such disclosure, Post Office shall first obtain such third party's written
agreement to comply with all non-disclosure and confidentiality terms herein.

Post Office shall keep a record of all disclosures by it of Escher Confidential
Information to third parties including the names of the persons to whom Escher
Confidential Information was disclosed by Post Office and a description of the

time it was disclosed or otherwise received by the other party;

(e) where such information becomes part of the public domain after
disclosure by means other than breach of the confidentiality
obligations contained in this paragraph 2.2 of this Schedule C3;
or

(f) where such information came into a party's possession lawfully
from a third party that was, itself, lawfully in possession of that
information and entitled to distribute it.

Where Escher Confidential Information is disclosed under paragraphs 2.2.7(b) or
2.2.7(c) of this Schedule C3, Post Office shall procure that the third parties
referred to in those paragraphs shall not disclose that Escher Confidential
Information without the prior written consent of Fujitsu Services.

The Existing Licences and their contents are deemed Escher Confidential
Information and, subject to paragraph 2.2.7 of this Schedule C3, Post Office may
not disclose the Existing Licences to a third party without the express written
consent of Fujitsu Services, except that Post Office may disclose those elements
of the Existing Licences which relate to the use of the Escher Upgrade Software
to the operator replacing Fujitsu Services in the event a direct licence is to be
granted to that replacement operator under paragraph 2.2.3.4 of Schedule B4.1
provided that such operator has, in advance of such disclosure, entered into
substantially equivalent confidentiality provisions with Post Office as are set out
in this paragraph 2 of this Schedule C3.

Escher Upgrade Software related documentation, defect reports, and all other
non-public information related to the Escher Upgrade Software, are and shall be
deemed Escher Confidential Information.

non-breaching Party shall provide written notice of such breach to the other.

Upon receipt of such notice, if such breach exists, the recipient shall have twenty
(20) days to remedy such breach or provide assurances in a form reasonably
acceptable to the non-breaching Party that the breach will be corrected within
such longer period as the non-breaching Party may specify.

If a breach by Post Office of any obligation imposed by paragraph 2 of Schedule
B4.1 and/or this paragraph 2 of this Schedule C3 has not within the twenty (20)
day period provided under paragraph 2.3.2 of this Schedule C3 been remedied
or assurances, in a form reasonably acceptable to Fujitsu Services, provided to

SCHEDULE D1
CHARGES
GENERAL

All amounts set out in this Schedule are before adjustment for RPI as set out in paragraph
16 and exclusive of VAT.

All annual Charges set out in this Schedule D1, unless otherwise stated, relate to
Financial Years. All monthly Charges relate to calendar months. All Charges shall, unless
stated otherwise, become due for payment on a monthly basis in accordance with the
provisions of Schedule D2.

Where during the term of this Agreement any charge under this Schedule D1 is amended
by approved CCN the Parties shall set out in the table contained in Annex E to this
Schedule D1 the number of the approved CCN, the amount of the variation and the date

on which the revised charge becomes effective.

In consideration for the provision by Fujitsu Services of the relevant Services, Post Office
shall pay to Fujitsu Services the following:

1.4.1. Operational Charges in accordance with paragraph 2 as varied in accordance
with paragraphs 4 and 5;

1.4.2 additional Operational Charges in accordance with paragraph 6;

1.4.3. Call Off Charges in accordance with paragraph 7;

1.4.4 Charges for Service Integration Services in accordance with paragraph 8;

1.4.5 Third Party Management Service Charges in accordance with paragraph 9;
1.4.6 Development Charges in accordance with paragraph 10;

1.4.7 SIP Charges in accordance with paragraph 11;

1.4.8 Transfer Charges in accordance with paragraph 12;

1.4.9 Capacity Addition Costs in accordance with paragraph 13;

1.4.10 PIN Pad Procurement Charges in accordance with paragraph 14;

1.4.11 Charges for Hardware in accordance with paragraph 15;

1.4.12 the Gain Share payments set out in Annex G; and

The Charges have been based on an assumption that the numbers of Branches, Counter
Positions, Old Style Mobile Configurations, New Style Mobile Configurations, CTOs and

New CTO Configurations in each Financial Year will not exceed the numbers
corresponding to that Financial Year as set out in the Table entitled “Branch and Counter

Schedule D1 Version 14.0

1.9

Position Limits” in Part 1 of Annex A. Should this assumption not be satisfied, as
evidenced by:

1.5.1. Post Office providing a forecast of numbers of Branches, Counter Positions, Old
Style Mobile Configurations, New Style Mobile Configurations, CTOs or New CTO
Configurations which exceed the limits set out in that Table for that Financial Year;
or

1.5.2 the actual number of Branches, Counter Positions or CTOs exceeding the
applicable limits in any three consecutive months,

the Parties shall agree changes to the Charges or Service Descriptions under the Change
Control Procedure to deal with additional equipment required by Fujitsu Services to
perform its obligations under this Agreement or the lack of availability of such equipment
for spares, maintenance or Operational Business Change purposes.

Services which cause or would cause the limits in the Table in Part 2 of Annex A to be
exceeded or the conditions specified in that Table not to be satisfied shall be subject to
the Change Control Procedure.

In this Schedule D1, unless stated otherwise, any reference to a paragraph or Annex is
to the relevant paragraph of, or annex to, this Schedule D1.

Without prejudice to any Charges which shall have become due to be paid by Post Office
to Fujitsu Services, and subject to paragraphs 9.2 and 9.3, if any Terminable Service is
subject to Partial Termination, the Operational Charges in respect of each Service
comprised within that Terminable Service shall not be payable in respect of the period
after the date of such Partial Termination.

For the purposes of this Schedule D1, from approval by Post Office of a part 2 Exit
Plan for a particular Operational Service, “Counter Positions" shall mean those
Counter Positions that are supported by Fujitsu Services and "Branches" means those
Branches that are supported by Fujitsu Services with respect to that Operational
Service. For the avoidance of doubt, once a particular Operational Service, Counter
Positions or Branches is/are supported by a Next Supplier or any other supplier (and
not Fujitsu Services) it/they shall cease to be “Counter Positions” or “Branches” for
such Operational Service for the purposes of this Schedule D1.

Example

Day 1 - Fujitsu supports the same 100 Counter Positions in respect of both the Engineering
Service and the Service Desk Service.

Day 2 - There is a ramp down of the Engineering Service and 50 Counter Positions become
supported by a Next Supplier while the remaining 50 Counter Positions are still supported by
Fujitsu. There is no change in respect of the Service Desk Service.

From Day 2, the number of Counter Positions for calculating the variable charge for the
Engineering Service would be 50 but it would still be 100 for the Service Desk Service.

accordance with paragraph 2.9.2(b)(i)) shall be less than the Protected Margin for that
Financial Year, then Post Office shall pay to Fujitsu Services an amount equal to the
difference.

The amount paid by Post Office in accordance with paragraph 3.1 in respect of any

obtains from Fujitsu Services in that Financial Year, provided such new Service is
provided for longer than twelve months.

Any credit available to Post Office pursuant to paragraph 3.2 shall be made available
monthly throughout the Financial Year in question based on estimates made on a year to
date basis in respect of each month. As soon as reasonably practicable following the end
of each such Financial Year the actual amount available by way of credit during that
Financial Year shall be calculated. If the amount available as a credit in respect of the
Financial Year as so calculated is greater than the aggregate of the monthly credits
actually made available to Post Office during that Financial Year the difference shall be
made available to the Post Office as an additional credit on the basis set out in paragraph
3.2. If the amount available as a credit in respect of the Financial Year as so calculated
is less than the aggregate of the monthly credits actually utilised by Post Office during
that Financial Year then the Post Office shall repay to Fujitsu Services an amount equal
to that shortfall.

In settlement of the incorrect calculation and invoicing by Fujitsu Services of margin
protection payments during the period April 2008 up to and including August 2009, the
parties have agreed that Fujitsu shall pay back to Post Office the sum of £339,396
erroneously paid out by Post Office during such period in margin protection payments.
£300,000 of such sum shall be repaid upon signature by the parties of the POLSAP Phase
1 Live Service CCN, and the balance shall be repaid upon signature of CCN 1268, each
as a credit to Post Office to be offset against monthly Operational Charges
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, such repayment by Fujitsu
shall not operate so as to reduce the aggregate amount of Operational Charges paid by
Post Office in the relevant Financial Year and so triggering margin protection payments
by Post Office pursuant to paragraph 3.1 above.

With effect from September 2009, without prejudice to its other obligations in relation to
margin protection, Fujitsu Services shall apply correctly the margin calculation at
paragraph 2.9.2 (b) (ii) above.

VARIATION OF OPERATIONAL CHARGES - TRIGGER POINTS

Assumptions have been made by the Parties about the timing of certain events set out in
the Trigger Point Table (referred to as "Trigger Points") in settling the amounts of the
Operational Charges.

For the avoidance of doubt, the planned dates in the Trigger Point Table shall not be
changed to reflect any changes that might be made to the HNG-X Programme Plan and
no adjustment shall be made to the Operational Charges in relation to Trigger Points
other than pursuant to paragraphs 4.2.3 or 4.2.4, unless the Parties agree otherwise
under the Change Control Procedure.

The principles that shall apply for adjustment to the Operational Fixed Charges and
Operational Unit Charges when Trigger Points occur early or late are as follows:

4.2.1 Not Used

4.2.2 In the event that Project HNG-X is terminated either pursuant to (i) Clause 47.15

or 47.7) or (ii) Clause 47.11.2, then the dates stated in the Trigger Point Table for
such of the Trigger Points that are planned to occur after HNG-X Initial
Acceptance (being, for the avoidance of doubt, Trigger Point T6 (Counter
Application Roll Out Complete) only) shall be put back (for the purposes of this
paragraph 4 only) to the date of the expiry or earlier termination of the Agreement,
provided that in each case such termination of Project HNG-X occurred prior to
HNG-X Initial Acceptance.

The Operational Fixed Charges and/or Operational Unit Charges (as specified in
the final column of the Trigger Point Table) for the Operational Services
corresponding to the Trigger Points (if any) adjusted in accordance with
paragraph 4.2.2 shall each be increased in each complete calendar month in the
period by which such Trigger Points are put back, by the amount of the "Late Cost
to Post Office” (if any) specified in the Trigger Point Table.

If any of the Trigger Points are delayed beyond the planned dates specified in
the Trigger Point Table, then to the extent that the delay was:

(a) caused by a Default or delay of Post Office or any of its employees,
agents or subcontractors, then Fujitsu Services shall be entitled to
increase the Operational Fixed Charges and/or Operational Unit Charges
(as specified in the final column of the Trigger Point Table) for the
Operational Services corresponding to that Trigger Point (as identified in
the Trigger Point Table) in each complete calendar month during the
period of that delay or Default by the amount of the “Late Cost to Post
Office” (if any) specified in the Trigger Point Table;

b) not caused by a Default or delay of Post Office, or any of its employees,
agents or subcontractors, then, without prejudice to any other right or
remedy of Post Office, Fujitsu Services shall continue to charge Post
Office the relevant Operational Charges in Annex C of this Schedule D1

If Post Office exercises its option under the CCD entitled “Service Description for the
Security Management Service” (CS/SER/016), when that CCD is in effect, or the CCD
entitled "Security Management Service: Service Description" (SVM/SDM/SD/0017), when
that CCD is in effect, to vary the maximum number of Audit Record Queries which Fujitsu
Services is required to carry out, the Operational Fixed Charge in respect of the Security
Management Service shall, with effect from the date on which that revised maximum
becomes effective, be increased by £ £249.18 per Audit Record Query by which such
maximum is increased.

processes and simplifying/rationalising the business rules around different
Reference Data types and their sources/validation;

5.6.2 introduce a generic model of product data to minimise the number of product
types, eliminate “special” product features and increase use of "soft" reference
data methods in lieu of "hard" application coding; and

5.6.3. apply Reference Data consistently across all elements of end-to-end solution.

Post Office shall pay to Fujitsu Services an addition to the Operational Fixed Charge for
the Reference Data Management Service due in respect of that month. In Financial
Year 2011/12 the additional monthly charge (if applicable) shall be £20,637, In respect
of each subsequent month, the charge shall be £21,627 where applicable. From 1%t
September 2013 no such charges shall apply.

Services introduced by CCN

Post Office may terminate the Services introduced by (i) CCN641a and (ii) CCN807 and
CCN1163 (as listed in the CCN Service List), by raising a CCN to terminate such Service,
subject to Fujitsu Services being entitled to reimbursement by Post Office of its
reasonable costs incurred in the termination of such Service by raising an invoice in
accordance with Schedule D2 in respect of such costs as they arise. If such Services are
so terminated, an amount per month equal to the monthly charge value for each such
Service (as set out in column three of the CCN Service List for the CCN introducing the
Service in question) shall be deducted from the Operational Fixed Charge for the Data
Centre Operations Service.

All of the Services introduced by CCN (as listed in the CCN Service List), other than
CCN641a, CCN807 and CCN1163, shall terminate in sequence with the migration of the
related Client systems from their existing interfaces with the Infrastructure to the EDG.

If following notice given by Post Office and development of an alternative approach any
of the Client systems referred to in paragraph 5.8 shall not have been migrated to the
EDG by the date of completion of HNG-X Project Workstream X2 (Migrate Data Centre
to HNG-X configuration), the Services introduced by CCN (as listed in the CCN Service
List) related to those Client systems shall continue and, with effect from that date, the
Charges for those Services set out in the CCN Service List shall be payable by Post Office
to Fujitsu Services until the relevant Client systems have been migrated to the EDG.

Periodic review of the CCN Service List to update it for additions and deletions shall be
managed by the Commercial Leads.

Impact of termination or expiry of the Service Desk Service on the Engineering Service:

Schedule D1 Version 14.0
Page 15 of 90

FUJ00234786
FUJ00234786
CONFIDENTIAL

5.12.1 At the date of CCN1400, it was acknowledged that the termination of the Service Desk
Service may have an impact on the volume of Engineering Service visits to Branches.
To this end, it is agreed that the Engineering Service shall be subject to Branch visit
volume baselines to be agreed between the parties (the “Expected Engineering
Volumes”) calculated by reference to the Engineering Reference Period in accordance
with the process set out below. This baseline shall be set out in a formal exchange of
letters.

5.12.2 With respect to the Engineering Service, Fujitsu Services shall record the volume of
Engineering Service visits to Branch and shall provide to Post Office data relating to
engineering visits in the Engineering Reference Period. The "Engineering Reference
Period” will be the later of either:

a) Six complete calendar months immediately prior to commencement of
rampdown of the Service Desk Service; or
b) Six complete calendar months immediately prior to notification of termination of

the Service Desk,

5.12.3 The Engineering Reference Period will be used to generate a forecast of expected
volume of Engineering Service visits to Branches for the period where Fujitsu Services
is providing the Engineering Service but the service desk is provided by a Next Supplier
(i.e. after the Service Desk Service has been terminated) so as to enable the parties to
agree the “Expected Engineering Volumes”.

5.12.4 In order to determine the Expected Engineering Volumes:

a) Post Office and Fujitsu Services shall jointly normalise the volume of visit data
measured during the Engineering Reference Period to take account of

i) particular circumstances occurring at any point in the Engineering
Reference Period;

ii) any peak periods included in the Engineering Reference Period,
whereby downward adjustments shall be made based on a reversal of
the uplifts (adjusted for any particular circumstances at that time)
experienced for each month in the same peak period in the prior year.

b) Normalisation will only be applied to significant programmes that have
materially impacted the Expected Engineering Volumes. Historic examples of
where this has been the case are the introduction of new media to Epson
printers which generated circa1000 additional engineering visits per month and
the programme rollout of new PIN Pads that generated circa 400 additional
engineering visits per month.

c) An 8% variance will be applied to the agreed volumes to generate upper (108%)
& lower (92%) threshold for each month.

d) With respect to months October to December (inclusive), an additional “peak
uplift” shall be applied to the Expected Engineering Volumes. The increased
percentage shall be applied for these months to take account of the expected
greater volumes of Engineering visits to Branches. The peak uplift in 2012
was as follows :-

Schedule D1 Version 14.0
Page 16 of 90

FUJ00234786
FUJ00234786
CONFIDENTIAL

i) October +10.0%
ii) November +19.7%
iii) December +12.7%

For the avoidance of doubt, months January to September (inclusive) will be considered
normal (non peak) months for the purpose of this calculation (and shall therefore only
be subject to the variance highlighted in paragraph c) above.

5.12.5 The agreed volumes together with the upper and lower thresholds and peak uplift
determined in accordance with paragraph 5.12.4 above shall form the Expected
Engineering Volumes. In addition, the Expected Engineering Volumes shall be linked to
the estate volume of 29,600 counters (or as per the average number of counters during
the Engineering Reference Period). If the actual estate size varies materially (+/- 1%)
between the volume agreed by reference to the Engineering Reference Period and the
period associated with the actual engineering visits measurement, an appropriate
adjustment will be made to the Expected Engineering Volumes.

5.12.6 At the end of each 3 month period following termination of the Service Desk Service, the
parties shall total the actual Engineering Service visits to Branches, this sum being,
subject to paragraph 5.12.10 below the “Actual Engineering Visits”

5.12.7 Should Actual Engineering Visits be greater than the upper threshold for the Expected
Engineering Volumes for that 3 month period, Post Office shall pay Fujitsu Services a
sum equivalent to credits as detailed in paragraph 5.12.9 below for each Engineering
visit to a Branch above the upper threshold.

5.12.8 Should Actual Engineering Visits be lower than the lower threshold for the Expected
Engineering Volumes for that month , Fujitsu Services will credit Post Office as detailed
in paragraph 5.12.9 for each Engineering visit to a Branch below the lower threshold.

5.12.9 For each additional visit over and above the Upper Threshold (108%) for the 3 month
period, Fujitsu Services shall be entitled to charge £125 per visit. In the event that the
number of visits made in that 3 month period is below the Lower Threshold (92%),
Fujitsu Services shall give a credit to the Post Office of £100 per visit. Additional
charges and credits shall be applied to the operational charge invoice and Fujitsu
Services shall provide supporting information.

5.12.10 For the avoidance of doubt, Actual Engineering Visits shall be based on:

a) the number of incidents passed from the Next Supplier of the replacement
Service Desk to the Engineering Service; and
b) the proactive incidents logged by Fujitsu Services (i.e. Bad blocks on Hard Disc

drives), but in this latter category these shall be limited to no more than 100
visits per month. If the actual volume of proactive incidents logged by Fujitsu
Services is greater than 100, only 100 will be counted in the actual Engineering
Service visits to Branches volumes for that month.

The following will be excluded from the measure of actual Engineering Service visits to
Branches:

Schedule D1 Version 14.0
Page 17 of 90

FUJ00234786
FUJ00234786
CONFIDENTIAL

i) any agreed user self-fix incidents that do not require an engineer to attend the
Branch, provided the Service Desk identifies them, and does not pass them to
Fujitsu Services’ engineering queue;

ii) any repeat visits to Branches with respect to the same recorded incident; and/or

iii) any engineering visits due to issues, or incidents arising from unexpected failure
across the branch network of a hardware component due to age that exceeds a
50% degradation in the MTBF rates (such rates determined by reference to the
MTBF rates occurring immediately prior to termination of the Service Desk
Service), save where such degradation in the MTBF rate can be directly
attributed to circumstances linked to a change introduced at the request of Post
Office whereupon such additional failures (over and above the MTBF rate +
50% degradation) shall be included in the calculations.

5.12.11 From the date that the Expected Engineering Volume becomes effective the charges to

Post Office in respect of MTBF excess visits shall cease to apply.

ADDITIONAL OPERATIONAL CHARGES

Additional Charges in respect of the Data Centre Operations Service

a) As an additional monthly Charge for the Data Centre Operations Service, if the
number of SAP Basis Calls per month exceeds ten, Post Office shall pay to Fujitsu
Services £223.17 for each such SAP Basis Call in excess of ten per month.

b) In the event that the parties agree that the Oracle database shall no longer be
within Oracle support then the monthly Charge for the Data Centre Operations Service
shall be uplifted by £30,000 per month and in the event that there is an Incident
involving the Oracle database, support shall be provided by Fujitsu Services on
reasonable endeavours (and as such Service Levels to the extent applicable will not
apply) and time and materials basis in accordance with the Rate Card where Fujitsu
Personnel are used and in accordance with Oracle's then current standard published
rate card (or cheaper) where assistance is required from Oracle. Oracle's position on
support is likely to evolve and future direction will form part of the jointly agreed
technology roadmap as described in Clause 10.9.

Additional Charges following termination for convenience

If Project HNG-X is terminated pursuant to (i) Clause 47.15, but only as a consequence
of the Agreement terminating pursuant to Clause 47.4 or 47.7, or (ii) Clause 47.11.2, Post
Office shall pay to Fujitsu Services, in respect of the period (if any) between 31 March
2010 and the earlier of termination or expiry of this Agreement an amount equal to:

6.2.1 the costs incurred by Fujitsu Services in respect of hardware and/or software

connection with the IBM Credence software set that may arise shall be managed and charged
via the Change Control Procedure.

In the event that Post Office wish to further renew the software via Fujitsu or novate the existing
software from Fujitsu then this shall be agreed and managed via the Change Control Procedure.

It was agreed for the extension of the Credence/ MDM Service beyond 31st March 2015 that the
ongoing charges in relation to the IBM Credence Software (for those licence products and
volumes that were procured from Fujitsu for the use by Credence in 2009) have been included
in the parallel-run charges for the initial infrastructure as contained in the final version of
CT1778 ‘Credence / MDM Infrastructure Tech Refresh’ and any required continuation changes
until the software is uninstalled.

The ongoing charges for IBM Credence Software (for those licences procured in CT1778
‘Credence / MDM Infrastructure Tech Refresh’) have been included in the Operational Charges
for the Credence/ MDM service from 1st April 2015.

6.8 In full and final settlement of any cause of action that at the date of signature of CCN

having been delivered in accordance with the timescales under the HNG-X
Programme Plan in its agreed form prior to signature of CCN 1268 (but no other
cause of action), which settlement (for the avoidance of doubt) does not preclude
adjustments (as agreed between the parties from time to time) to these terms in the
event that the plan is further amended, Fujitsu Services shall pay to Post Office each
month, between October 2009 and February 2010 inclusive, the sum of £1 million
(exclusive of VAT). This shall be in the form of a credit note which will be offset against
the total Operational Charges invoiced for the relevant month. The credit note shall
not operate so as to reduce the aggregate amount of the Operational Charges
calculated in respect of the relevant Financial Year thus triggering margin protection
payments by Post Office pursuant to paragraph 3.1 of this Schedule D1.

The following shall also apply to the Charging for the Outer Core team:

(i) The default pre-committed monthly Charge for the Outer Core team shall be
£150,000.
(ii) Post Office shall confirm its committed monthly spend and the mix of skills in

this team 3 months in advance of the month to which it wishes to apply the
discount. In order to qualify for the discount, the Post Office shall provide its
projected spend for 18' April 2015 to 30" June 2015 on or before 315! December
2014.

(ili) Fujitsu Services shall apply the discount applicable to the committed monthly

Office fail to commit to a monthly spend 3 months in advance or separately fails
to meet monthly committed level of spend they will lose the discount for that
and the previous 2 months. In the event that Post Office fails to meet its
monthly committed level of spend in April 2015, May 2015 or June 2015, it shall

additional 6 month period that Post Office, in advance, makes a committed
monthly spend. For example, if Post Office were to commit to spend £500,000
per month from 1%' April 2015 to 31st March 2016 it would be entitled toa
discount of 9% on the rates set out in the Rate Card. In order to receive this
discount, Post Office must give the commitment at least 3 months prior to the
first day of the committed period. So, for example, in order to receive the total
discount for 2 years commitment Post Office shall be required to make this
commitment by 318 December 2014.

(vi) There are no individual resource rate card reductions in addition to this
mechanism.

The Development Charges shall be due for payment monthly in arrears.

the SIP Team pursuant to Schedule B1.2, Post Office shall pay Fujitsu Services for such
provision on a time-cost basis, being rates equal to the cost to Fujitsu Services (on a
break-even basis) of employing the relevant individuals, taking into account for the

grade encompasses more than one professional community grade within Fujitsu Services’
organisational structure. Such cost shall be certified by Fujitsu Services in accordance
with paragraph 1.5 of Schedule D4.

During the Financial Year 2006/7 the charges for each grade of Fujitsu Services staff in
the SIP shall, unless paragraph 11.4 applies, be calculated according to the rates for non-

performing that role shall be recalculated using the applicable rate for non-committed
resource and Post Office shall pay to Fujitsu Services an amount equal to the difference.

The Charges for resources for the SIP shall become due for payment monthly in arrear.

The rates for each grade set out in the table in paragraph 11.2 shall be varied in each
subsequent Financial Year to reflect the costs to Fujitsu Services referred to in paragraph
11.1 (the component elements of which costs are as set out in the table “Breakdown of
Day Rate Calculation - Example Grades” referred to in paragraph 2 of the CCD entitled
“HNG-X Baseline Open Book Information” (COM/MGT/PRO/0002)) for that Financial Year
as applicable in respect of each such grade, taking into account any averaging required
where that grade encompasses more than one professional community grade within
Fujitsu Services organisational structure. For the purposes of the rates for each grade of
committed resource in the table in paragraph 11.2, such variation shall be on the basis
that Post Office commits at the beginning of the Financial Year to utilising that grade of
resource for 204 days in that Financial Year. Paragraph 11.4 shall apply in respect of
each Financial Year after 2006/7 with the necessary changes deemed to be made to it to
reflect such 204 day commitment applying from the beginning of the Financial Year rather
than the 100 days referred to applying from September 2006.

In each case where a Fujitsu Services SIP Team Member is unable to perform a specified
role due to illness, injury or any other reason outside Post Office's control, the number of
days for which he is unable to perform that role shall be deemed to be included within a
period of utilisation of that role for the purposes of determining whether Post Office has
not utilised a specified role.

CHARGES FOR TRANSFER SERVICES

Post Office shall pay Fujitsu Services for all Transfer Services provided in the event of
Partial Termination, termination of Project HNG-X, termination of the Agreement or expiry
of the Agreement on a time-cost basis according to the rates set out in the Table in

10.5.

If Transfer Services are provided prior to 31 March 2010, any unused balance at the end
of each month of the pre-payment referred to in paragraph 10.3 may, at Post Office's
option, be offset as a credit against the Charges due that month for such Transfer Services
in accordance with paragraph 12.1.

Fujitsu Services’ Charges in respect of materials and expenses in connection with the
provision of Transfer Services shall be calculated in the same way as they are calculated
for Development Services as set out in paragraphs 10.7 and 10.8.

CAPACITY ADDITIONS

The capacity planning and performance and volume monitoring carried out as part of the
Service Management Service may from time to time identify that forecast volumes of Post
Office business are likely to exceed those allowed for and the consequent need to add
capacity to an element of the HNG-X Systems so as to maintain Fujitsu Services’
capability to achieve Service Levels.

16.5 For this purpose:

16.5.1 the Relevant Indian Index shall mean the all-India Consumer Price index (UNME)
published by the Government of India Ministry of Statistics and Programme
Implementation. In the event that such index is no longer published and the
Parties fail to agree a suitable substitute index it shall mean such index as is
recommended as a suitable alternative by expert determination in accordance
with Schedule A2;

16.5.1.1 At the end of December 2010 the all-India Consumer Price index (UNME)
referred to in paragraph 16.5.1 above was ceased. The Relevant Indian Index
used in the calculation in paragraph 16.4 to derive the indexation to be applied
to the Near Shore and Offshore Rates for year ending 31st March 2013
onwards shall be based on the “All India General (all Groups) Consumer Price
Index for Urban Areas” as published by the by the Government of India Ministry
of Statistics and Programme Implementation; and

16.5.2 the Relevant Exchange Rate in respect of any December shall be the arithmetical
mean of all the daily spot exchange rates published by the Bank of England in
respect of that December on its website (www.bankofengland.co.uk) under
reference “Rupee to Sterling Daily Spot Rate - XUDLBK97”.

16.6 For the avoidance of doubt, any Service provided in one Financial Year but not invoiced
until a subsequent Financial Year shall be invoiced at the fixed charge or charging rate
applicable to such Service at the time it was supplied. The Parties agree that at the end
of each Financial Year, Fujitsu Services may increase the Day Rates listed in a CWO in
accordance with Paragraph 16 of Schedule D1 (Charges). The increased Day Rates shall
apply to the Services that have not been provided by Fujitsu Services under a CWO at
the point of increase.

16.7. The rates at which liquidated damages are payable in respect of Service Level
Measurement Periods shall be increased in each of the Financial Years set out in the
following table by the RPI Adjustment Factor for that Financial Year, being the difference,

INVEST TO SAVE MODEL

Post Office shall make a payment to Fujitsu of £1.3m (one million three hundred thousand

pounds) on ‘st April 2017, and £2.6m (two million six hundred thousand pounds) in
quarter 3 financial year 2017-2018 (within 20 Working Days from the invoice date) (total
£3.9m) for Fujitsu Services to invest in projects with the aim to reduce Fujitsu Services
cost base for delivery of the Services (the “Invest to Save Payment’).

In consideration of this Invest to Save Payment, the Operational Charges shall be
reduced by the monthly credit, from 1st April 2017 until 318! March 2023, referred to in
Annex B of Schedule D1 as ‘Invest to Save Credit' (the “Invest to Save Credit”). For the
avoidance of doubt this credit shall be in addition to the Trinity 1 Credit referred to in
paragraph 2.14 of Schedule D1.

It shall be at Fujitsu Services’ absolute discretion what projects it implements as a result
of the receipt of the Invest to Save Payment in order to achieve the required savings to
its cost base to enable the Invest to Save Credit to be provided without impacting Fujitsu
Services’ margin. However this shall be at Fujitsu Services’ risk and as such the Invest
to Save Credit shall be credit irrespective of the operational savings actually achieved by
Fujitsu Services.

In order to enable Fujitsu Services to achieve these required savings it has forecasted in
order to fund the Invest to Save Credit, Post Office acknowledges and agrees that Fujitsu
Services may need to make technical changes to the solution, assets and/or restructure
its resources and/or increase its off-shore capability and as such, to the extent to which
Fujitsu Services is required to ask consent from Post Office to enact these or any other
changes, Post Office shall not unreasonably withhold or delay such consent and the costs
of any such technical change shall be borne by Fujitsu Services.

The Invest to Save model detailed in this paragraph 17 is separate from the Gain Share
mechanism detailed in Schedule D3 (Gain Share) which shall remain available for both
parties to make use of. However, for the avoidance of doubt, no single project can be part
of this Invest to Save model and the Gain Share mechanism and as such it shall be at
Fujitsu Services’ absolute discretion whether it elects to deliver a project as part of its
commitment under the “Invest to Save” mechanism set out in this paragraph 17 or the Gain
Share mechanism detailed in Schedule D3 (Gain Share). The Parties agree this is fair
given the fact that Fujitsu Services is taking the risk of achieving the requisite savings.”

The Invest to Save values are subject to the following indexation approach:

a. For the fiscal year 1st April 2017, to 31st March 2018, there will be no
indexation applied to savings and payments.

b. For the fiscal year 1st April 2018, to 31st March 2019, there will be no
indexation applied to savings.

c. For the fiscal year 1st April 2019 to 31st March 2020, there will be an
indexation charge equivalent to 75% of the applicable indexation rate.

CCN1204a April 2008 -

CCN1204a referred to in the table above relates to Post Office's initial order for 10,000 replacement counter printers. The Parties anticipate that Post Office
may, in its discretion, order additional counter printers and that, when the changes to the Agreement necessary in respect of such additional printers are
introduced under the Change Control Procedure, adjustments will be made in respect of the figures in the table above so that they are all positive. In the event
that no further printers are ordered by Post Office, beyond the initial order for 10,000 printers, the negative figures in the table above represent amounts that
shall be paid on a monthly basis in the Financial Years in question by Fujitsu Services to Post Office. The above figures have been calculated on the basis of
an agreed estimate of the value of consumables which will be required in respect of the replacement counter printers and therefore, on or about 1 April 2008,
Post Office and Fujitsu Services shall review the above Gain Share payments in the light of the actual cost of such consumables and those payments may be
amended by agreement between Post Office and Fujitsu Services (such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed by either party) in accordance
with Change Control Procedure.

detailed response, would require analysis to be undertaken by Fujitsu Services after 31
March 2010, Fujitsu Services' obligation under paragraph 5.6 shall be for its authorised
representative to provide Post Office within three weeks of receipt of that Work Package
request with a high level response indicating the charges that would be payable by Post

request. Such high level response shall set out:

5.7.1 the number of man days of effort required by grade;
57.2 lead times, start and end dates for the work required; and

5.7.3 the nature of the task envisaged, to enable the appropriate skill set to be
identified.

period, notify Fujitsu Services whether it wishes Fujitsu Services to respond to the
request for Work Package on the terms proposed by Fujitsu Services (or such other
terms as the Parties may agree) and if so shall authorise Fujitsu Services to produce a
detailed response on those terms and otherwise in accordance with paragraph 5.6.

Post Office Contract Management shall:

5.8.1 counter-sign the proposed Agreed Form Terms & Conditions;
5.8.2 where a CCN is required, counter-sign the CCN;

Order to Post Office within five Working Days clearly marked “rejected”, in which case
it shall be of no effect. If not so returned, it shall be deemed accepted notwithstanding
that it was received after the Expiry Date.

changes to the Agreement such that a CCN should have been agreed beforehand, that
Party shall notify the other immediately and the Commercial Leads shall discuss the
matter as soon as possible. If the Parties are unable to agree a CCN or a restriction of

in each case, provided that each party has carried out those actions
that it agreed to undertake in order to achieve the relevant Benefits;
and/or

3.1.2 sharing (in accordance with the principles set out in this Schedule)
Post Office's increase in profits or reduction in losses arising from
new additional revenues that result from the initiative or future
development in question.

If the Parties agree that paragraph 3.1.1(b) or 3.1.2 apply, Post Office shall pay
Fujitsu Services' agreed share of the Benefits which, unless otherwise agreed,
shall be invoiced monthly in arrear in accordance with the provisions of Schedule
D2.

The amount of the Benefits from each initiative or development available for Gain
Share by each Party shall be ascertained in accordance with the provisions of
Schedule D4.

Any agreed share of Benefits duly payable to Fujitsu Services under this
Schedule D3 shall continue beyond termination or expiry of the entire
Agreement, and the Open Book provisions in Schedule D4 shall continue to
apply to enable verification of the Benefits available.

GAIN SHARE PRINCIPLES

Subject to paragraph 5, the Benefits resulting from each initiative or development
shall be shared between the Parties according to the following principles:

Investment Recovery
4.2.1 Each Party shall be entitled to recover:

(a) its actual investment in the initiative or development;
plus

(b) sufficient additional amounts to deliver an internal
rate of return equal to the official Bank of England
rate plus 2% per annum,

to the extent the aggregate of (a) and (b) is less than or equal to the
Benefits (such amount being the “Investment Recovery”).

4.2.2 Investment Recovery by each Party shall be achieved over the life of
the assets acquired for the initiative or development or the duration of
the initiative or development (as applicable) and shall be phased such
that Investment Recovery is paid for out of the Benefits.

4.2.3 The amount of the Benefits utilised for Investment Recovery shall (if
possible) be a fixed proportion (to be agreed on a case by case basis)

Schedule D3 Version 14.0
Page 4 of 7

FUJ00234786
FUJ00234786
CONFIDENTIAL

of the Benefits in each of the years over the life of the assets acquired
for the initiative or development or the duration of the initiative or
development (as applicable).

4.2.4 Each Party's Investment Recovery as a share of the Benefits shall be
in proportion to the amount actually invested by that Party in the
initiative or development as compared to the amount actually invested
by the other Party in that initiative or development.

43 Additional Benefits

4.3.1 Subject to paragraph 4.4.1, where Fujitsu Services provides actual
investment entitling it to an Investment Recovery under paragraph
4.2, the proportion of the Benefits remaining after that allocated for
Investment Recovery in accordance with paragraph 4.2 (“Additional
Benefits”) shall, subject to paragraph 4.3.2, be allocated between the
Parties as follows:

(a) in the first twelve calendar months of Investment
Recovery, Additional Benefits shall be allocated 70%
to Fujitsu Services and 30% to Post Office;

(b) in the twelve calendar months after (a), Additional
Benefits shall be allocated 50% to Fujitsu Services
and 50% to Post Office;

(c) in the twelve calendar months after (b), Additional
Benefits shall be allocated 30% to Fujitsu Services
and 70% to Post Office; and

(d) in subsequent years all Additional Benefits shall be
allocated to Post Office.

If the initiative or development in question is implemented in stages or
is phased, the Additional Benefits resulting from each such stage or
phase shall be treated separately and shared in accordance with the
provisions above in this paragraph 4.3 with effect from the date of
implementation of that stage or phase.

4.3.2 If Fujitsu Services’ anticipated return, being calculated as the internal
rate of return of a cash flow at constant prices (i.e. without adjustment
for inflation) and before tax, comprising (i) its investment (as a
negative amount) and (ii) its Investment Recovery and (iii) its share of
the Additional Benefits (each of (ii) and (iii) as positive amounts):

(a) is less than 13% per annum then Fujitsu Services’
share of the Additional Benefits shall be increased
and Post Office's share decreased such that Fujitsu
Services' total return on investment is above its

Schedule D3 Version 14.0
Page 5 of 7

FUJ00234786
FUJ00234786
CONFIDENTIAL

anticipated total return on investment but no more
than the lesser of:

(i) 13% per annum; and

(ii) the level at which Fujitsu Services’ and Post Office's
similarly calculated anticipated total internal rates of
return on investment are equal; or

(b) exceeds 30% per annum then Fujitsu Services’
share of the Additional Benefits shall be decreased
and Post Office's share increased such that Fujitsu
Services’ total return on investment is equal to 30%
per annum.

In the case of both (a) and (b) any such adjustments to the share of
Additional Benefits will be on a basis that takes into account the years
in which the investment is made and the extent of investment made in
each year.

44 Alternative Approach

4.44

Where Fujitsu Services does not provide any actual investment
entitling it to an Investment Recovery in relation to an initiative or
development resulting in Benefits or if the application of the principles
set out in this paragraph 4.4 in respect of any Additional Benefits
would result in Fujitsu Services having a greater share of those
Additional Benefits than it would do under paragraph 4.3, then the
principles set out in this paragraph 4.4 shall apply instead of those in
paragraph 4.3.

In relation to each initiative or development resulting in Benefits, any
Additional Benefits (which, if Fujitsu Services does not provide any
actual investment, shall be the proportion of the Benefits remaining
after that allocated for Investment Recovery to Post Office only) shall
be allocated between the Parties as follows:

(a) in the first thirty six calendar months of Investment
Recovery, Additional Benefits shall be allocated 10%
to Fujitsu Services and 90% to Post Office; and

(b) in subsequent years all Additional Benefits shall be allocated
to Post Office.

If the initiative or development in question is implemented in stages or
is phased, the Additional Benefits resulting from each such stage or
phase shall be treated separately and shared in accordance with the
provisions above in this paragraph 4.4 with effect from the date of
implementation of that stage or phase.

For Benefits of the type described in paragraph 2.1.1, if during the periods
referred to in paragraphs 4.3.1(a) to (c) (inclusive) and 4.4.2(a) in which
Additional Benefits are apportioned (as adjusted in accordance with paragraph
4.3.2, where applicable) it is established through Benchmarking that the Charges
for delivering an HNG-X Service (excluding the Gain Share payments (if any) in
respect of that HNG-X Service) are above the target price range (as described in
paragraph 3.8 of Schedule D6) the Gain Share payments being made to Fujitsu
Services in respect of that HNG-X Service shall cease.

ALTERNATIVE GAIN SHARE APPROACHES.

The Parties acknowledge and agree that the Gain Share principles set out in this
Schedule in relation to the Benefits eligible for Gain Share and the means of
sharing those benefits may not be applicable or appropriate to every Gain Share
initiative or development.

Each Party shall consider and shall not unreasonably withhold or delay its
agreement to any reasonable modified or alternative Gain Share arrangement
proposed by the other Party in relation to a particular initiative or development.
Such matters shall be dealt with by the Systems Integration Partnership and
Executive Relationship.

The parties acknowledge and agree that in exceptional circumstances it may be
beneficial to consider proposals which generate savings in the Charges but only
if the HNG-X Services, Service Levels or other provisions of this Agreement are
changed. Any Gain Share payable in such cases shall be agreed on a case by
case basis following the general approach set out above.

SCHEDULE D6
MARKET TESTING

OVERVIEW

This Schedule D6 defines the processes available to the Parties for Market Testing the
Testable Services.

MARKET TESTING METHODS

Subject to paragraphs 5.1 and 6.1, the Market Testing method for all Testable Services
shall be Benchmarking.

Fujitsu Services may not increase any Charges, decrease any Services Levels or
(unless required by Post Office pursuant to paragraph 4.3) cease providing any
Services in connection with or as a consequence of Market Testing save where Fujitsu
Services participates in Competitive Tendering and is appointed by Post Office as the
winning tenderer, in which case the Agreement shall be amended under the Change
Control Procedure to reflect Fujitsu Services’ tender as described in paragraph 4.3.3(a).

Governance in respect of Market Testing in terms of monitoring, review and reporting of
events and progress and issue resolution shall be managed by the Commercial
Relationship and overseen by the Systems Integration Partnership and Executive
Relationship, as described in Schedule A2.

BENCHMARKING

The purpose of Benchmarking (the "Benchmark Purpose") is to compare the value for
money of the Benchmark Services with Equivalent Services. The focus shall be on
comparing the price of the Benchmark Services with market prices, but taking account
of current technologies at the time of Benchmarking, and not restricted to the same
technical solution as is used in the HNG-X Services.

The target price range for each Benchmark Service shall be as described in paragraph
3.8.

The Charges for the Benchmark Service to be used in Benchmarking comparisons are
the Charges then set out in paragraph 2 of Schedule D1 (as adjusted in accordance
with paragraph 4 of Schedule D1) for that Service for the remaining term of the
Agreement, applying the volumes (in relation to any variable Charges) then forecast in
the CCD entitled "Horizon Capacity Management and Business Volumes”
(PA/PER/033), excluding (i) the Service Management Element, and (ii) any Gain Share
payments that may be payable to Fujitsu Services in relation to cost savings in respect
of that Service.

Fujitsu Services shall, unless paragraph 5.1.2 applies, initiate Benchmarking and unless
any of paragraphs 5.1.1, 5.1.3, 6.1.1 or 6.1.3 apply procure that Benchmarking is
completed in respect of each Testable Service referred to in the Benchmarking timetable
in Annex 2 (as such timetable is varied in accordance with paragraph 3.5) in each

3.7

Financial Year in which that Service is due to be Benchmarked as set out in that
timetable up to and including 31st March 2015. After 318 March 2015, the Parties
acknowledge and agree that there shall be no Benchmarking of Testable Services.

The Benchmarking timetable in Annex 2 may be revised and any Testable Services set
out in Annex 1 may be added to that timetable by written agreement between the
Parties, subject to the following provisions:

3.5.1 no more than two Testable Services shall be timetabled for Benchmarking in any
Financial Year;

3.5.2 no Testable Service shall be timetabled for Benchmarking more than once every
three Financial Years; and

3.5.3 no Testable Service shall be Benchmarked before the Service first becomes
eligible for Benchmarking as set out in Annex 1.

If no revisions are agreed to the timetable in Annex 2 then, subject to paragraph 3.5.3,
that shall be the timetable for Benchmarking. The date in the Benchmarking timetable
by which a Benchmarking is due to be completed shall be put back, day for day, to the
extent that Post Office unreasonably withholds or delays its agreement under paragraph
3.7.3 to the Benchmarker's proposed approach for that Benchmarking.

Fujitsu Services shall procure Benchmarking from the Benchmarking consultancy who
ordinarily provides benchmarking services to Fujitsu Services, provided that that person
is an independent and generally recognised, within the IT industry, benchmarking
consultancy in the United Kingdom (the “Benchmarker”). The Parties acknowledge that
at the date of this Agreement Fujitsu Services uses Gartner Consulting or Compass
Management Consulting as its benchmarking consultant, either of which may be used
by Fujitsu Services as the Benchmarker so long as it remains an independent and
generally recognised, within the IT industry, benchmarking consultancy in the United
Kingdom. Any alternative benchmarking consultancy used to undertake Benchmarking
that meets the requirements of the first sentence of this paragraph shall be notified by
Fujitsu Services to Post Office.

Fujitsu Services shall procure that:

3.7.1. the Benchmarker shall select services for the Benchmark Group of an
appropriate standard, quality and relevance to the Benchmark Services in order
to achieve the Benchmark Purpose having due regard to all relevant factors,
including the nature and type of service concerned and the requirement of the
service recipient in relation thereto. The Benchmark Group shall (where such
services are available in the market) include examples of services which meet
the same business requirements as a Benchmark Service, but which utilise
more recent technology than that used to deliver the relevant Benchmark
Service;

3.7.2 no later than 30 Working Days before the date notified by Fujitsu Services to
Post Office when each Benchmarking is due to commence, Post Office shall be
provided with the Benchmarker's proposed approach to Benchmarking,

Schedule D6 Version 14.0
Page 3 of 13

3.8

3.9

including the Benchmark Group that is proposed and the metrics to be used in
adjusting benchmark data so that comparisons can be made on a like-for-like
basis;

3.7.3 without prejudice to Post Office's right under paragraph 6.1.3, the Benchmarker
shall make such changes to the approach as the Parties and the Benchmarker
consider and agree to be reasonable, such changes to the approach to be
agreed no later than 20 Working Days before the Benchmarking is due to
commence. Either Party may include within such changes as are requested a
request that the Benchmark Group includes a service that meets the same
business requirements as the Benchmark Service, irrespective of the
technology used to deliver that service;

3.7.4 within 30 Working Days following the date on which a particular Benchmarking
is due to be completed in accordance with the timetable referred to in paragraph
3.4, the Benchmarker shall deliver a benchmarking report to each Party (a
“Benchmarking Report"). The Benchmarking Report shall contain the
documented findings and recommendations of the Benchmarker, including any
key financial and technical information supporting such recommendations; and

3.7.5 Post Office is given such direct access to the Benchmarker and the data and
information underlying the Benchmarking Report as Post Office may reasonably
require in order to discuss and understand the Benchmarking Report and its
assumptions.

If the Charges for the Benchmark Services (as described in paragraph 3.3) are greater
than the amount "A" calculated using the following formula those Charges shall be
deemed to be above the target price range, that range, for the purposes of this
Schedule D6, being the range between the lowest price service in the Benchmark
Group and the amount "A".

A= ((0.375N — Z) x (P2—P1))+P1

where

N is the total number of services in the Benchmark Group;

Z is the integer part of 37.5% of N;

P1, having put the services in the Benchmark Group in ascending order by price (such
prices having been adjusted pursuant to any agreed weighting mechanism applied by
the Benchmarker) and numbered those services consecutively starting at one for the

service with the lowest price, is the price for the service numbered Z; and

P2 is the price for the service numbered Z + 1, such price having been adjusted
pursuant to any agreed weighting mechanism applied by the Benchmarker.

If, pursuant to paragraph 3.8, the Charges for the Benchmark Service are deemed to be
above the target price range, within 30 days of the issue of the Benchmarking Report
Fujitsu Services shall:

either adjust its price for the Benchmark Service so that it falls within the target
price range and continue to provide the Benchmark Service as previously; or

initiate Competitive Tendering in accordance with paragraph 5 to appoint a new
sub-contractor to Fujitsu Services in respect of the Benchmark Service so that
the Benchmark Service may be provided more cost-effectively; or

notify Post Office that (i) it does not consider it possible to provide the
Benchmark Service at a price that is within the target price range and achieve
an adequate gross margin on that Benchmark Service and (ii) its reasons for
this conclusion.

4, COMPETITIVE TENDERING

44 The purpose of Competitive Tendering is to identify potential alternative suppliers of
Competitive Tendering Services (either as potential sub-contractors to Fujitsu Services
or as direct suppliers of the service to Post Office) who can offer improved value for
money in providing the Competitive Tendering Services.

42 Competitive Tendering may be carried out either:

4.2.1

4.2.2

by Fujitsu Services (for the purpose of finding a new sub-contractor), in the
circumstances described in paragraph 5.1; or

by Post Office (for the purpose of finding a new direct supplier) pursuant to
paragraph 6.1.

43 Following Competitive Tendering, Post Office may decide at its sole option:

4.3.1

4.3.2

4.3.3

to continue with the current Service from Fujitsu Services at the current prices;

in the case of Competitive Tendering undertaken by Fujitsu Services where the
outcome of the tender process is such that, if Fujitsu Services was to sub-
contract all or part of the Competitive Tendering Service in question to an
alternative service provider identified in the tender process a downward revision
to the Charges would be, in the mutual opinion of the Post Office and Fujitsu
Services, deliverable, to require Fujitsu Services to sub-contract such
Competitive Tendering Service to such alternative service provider and revise its
Charges accordingly so that the Charge for that Competitive Tendering Service
shall be equivalent to the sum of: (i) the costs to Fujitsu Services of that sub-
contract (which may include Interface Establishment Costs allocated to such
alternative service provider), (ii) the Relevant Margin thereon, and (iii) the
Service Management Element; or

in the case of Competitive Tendering undertaken by Post Office:
(a) where Fujitsu Services is the winning tenderer, to continue with the

Competitive Tendering Service from Fujitsu Services on a revised basis
to be agreed under the Change Control Procedure, to reflect the

Schedule D6 Version 14.0

Page 5 of 13

FUJ00234786
FUJ00234786
CONFIDENTIAL
specification and charges for that service tendered by Fujitsu Services,
as amended and agreed with Post Office; or
(b) where the outcome of the tender process is that an Equivalent Service
to the Competitive Tendering Service is available at a price which is less

than the Charges for that Competitive Tendering Service (excluding (i)

the Service Management Element, and (ii) any Gain Share payments

that may be payable to Fujitsu Services in relation to cost savings in
respect of that Service) either:

(i) to invite Fujitsu Services to appoint the winning tenderer as a
new subcontractor within 60 Working Days (or such other period
as the Parties may agree) of such invitation and to revise its
Charges for the Competitive Tendering Service on the same
basis as such Charges may be revised under paragraph 4.3.2;
or

(ii) to appoint the winning tenderer as a direct supplier to Post
Office and terminate that Competitive Tendering Service (as a
Terminable Service) in accordance with Clause 47.10.1 of the
Agreement.

44 In the event that Post Office exercises its option pursuant to paragraph 4.3.3(b)(i) and

5.1

either:
4.4.1 Fujitsu declines to appoint such winning tenderer; or

4.4.2 the time limit specified in paragraph 4.3.3(b)(i) expires prior to Fujitsu Services
appointing the winning tenderer,

Post Office may, at its sole option, exercise its rights under paragraph 4.3.3(b)(ii), failing
which paragraph 4.3.1 shall apply.

COMPETITIVE TENDERING BY FUJITSU SERVICES
Fujitsu Services shall undertake Competitive Tendering where:

5.1.1 subject to paragraph 6.1.3, the Benchmarker notifies the Parties that, in the
Benchmarker's reasonable opinion, due to the lack of availability of suitable
services for inclusion in the Benchmark Group or other reasons in connection
with the Benchmarking process or criteria, it will not be or has not been possible
to perform a satisfactory Benchmarking for that Service and the Parties agree
that Competitive Tendering by Fujitsu Services may result in a downward
revision to the Charges for the Testable Service in question; or

5.1.2 the Parties have agreed that the Testable Service is one which should be
provided by Fujitsu Services through sub-contractors, with the aim that each
such subcontract should be of no more than four years’ duration; or

5.2

5.4

5.5

5.1.3 Fujitsu Services fails to initiate Benchmarking of a Testable Service in
accordance with paragraph 3.4, and Post Office notifies Fujitsu Services that
Fujitsu Services shall initiate a competition in respect of that Testable Service in
accordance with this paragraph 5; or

5.1.4 paragraph 3.9.2 applies,

and in each case Fujitsu Services shall initiate Competitive Tendering within three
months.

When paragraph 5.1 applies Fujitsu Services shall carry out, or procure that an
Independent Adviser (such Independent Adviser to be agreed with Post Office and such
agreement not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) conducts, Competitive
Tendering in each case with a view to appointing a new sub-contractor to Fujitsu
Services in respect of the Service in question so that the Service may be provided more
cost-effectively.

Fujitsu Services shall ensure that:

5.3.1 once initiated in accordance with paragraph 5.1, Competitive Tendering shall be
actively continued and in any event completed within six months or in
accordance with any timetable agreed in writing between the Parties;

5.3.2 all invitations to tender and other key tender documents are submitted to Post
Office for its approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed) prior to being provided to potential tenderers; and

5.3.3 Post Office is provided with copies of all tenders received, subsequent related
correspondence and documentation and valuation assumptions or processes
adopted from time to time throughout the tendering process and, in the event an
Independent Adviser is used, is given the opportunity to discuss the tenders with
that Independent Adviser.

The three month period referred to in paragraph 5.1 and the six month period referred to
in paragraph 5.3.1 shall each be extended, day for day, to the extent that Post Office
unreasonably withholds or delays its approval of the tender documentation referred to in
paragraph 5.3.2 or otherwise delays the Competitive Tendering by Fujitsu Services in
accordance with paragraphs 5.2 and 5.3.

Fujitsu Services shall disclose to any bona fide potential sub-contractor of Competitive
Tendering Services (subject to the same executing an Agreed Form NDA or any other
form of non-disclosure agreement mutually agreed by Post Office, Fujitsu Services and
such potential sub-contractor) Confidential Information to the extent that such disclosure
is reasonably required to enable that potential sub-contractor to prepare a reasonably
detailed tender proposal, including an anonymised list providing details of the terms and
conditions of employment of all Fujitsu Services personnel (and those personnel of its
relevant sub-contractors) who are then wholly or mainly employed or engaged in the
performance of the Competitive Tendering Services, to the extent such personnel may
be subject to the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations
2006 if such Services were transferred (including, as a minimum, information on (i)

numbers of personnel (employees, contractors and temporary staff), (ii) salaries and
other benefits, bonuses and pensions arrangements, (iii) where readily available to
Fujitsu Services, skills sets and employment grades, (iv) age and length of service
profile, (v) locations of personnel and (vi) such key employee policies as shall be
generally known to the relevant employees and relevant to their terms of employment or
reasonable expectations).

COMPETITIVE TENDERING BY POST OFFICE
Subject to paragraph 6.2, Post Office shall be entitled if:

6.1.1. Benchmarking by Fujitsu Services pursuant to paragraph 3.4 in respect of any
Testable Service is not initiated in accordance with the Benchmarking timetable
in Annex 2 (as adjusted in accordance with paragraph 3.5) or Fujitsu Services
fails to procure the outputs required by paragraph 3.7 to achieve such
Benchmarking or Fujitsu Services fails to comply with its obligations under
paragraph 3.9 and Fujitsu Services fails to comply with written notice delivered
by Post Office to Fujitsu Services within 60 days of such notice to initiate such
Benchmarking or procure such outputs or comply with such obligations, or

6.1.2 following Benchmarking, Fujitsu Services gives notice to Post Office in
accordance with paragraph 3.9.3; or

6.1.3 it does not agree on a reasonable ground to the Benchmarking approach to be
used by the Benchmarker; or

6.1.4 Competitive Tendering by Fujitsu Services is not initiated within the period
specified in paragraph 5.1 (as may be adjusted in accordance with paragraph
5.4); or

6.1.5 there is a Default by Fujitsu Services in relation to its Competitive Tendering
obligations in paragraph 5.3.1 (the six month period therein as may be adjusted
in accordance with paragraph 5.4),

to initiate a competition within six months respectively of (i) expiry of the 60 day notice
period referred to in paragraph 6.1.1, (ii) receipt of notice under paragraph 3.9.3, (iii) the
date the Benchmarking was due to commence or (iv) expiry of the period referred to in
paragraph 5.1 or (v) Fujitsu Services’ Default in relation to its obligations in paragraph
5.3.1 (as the case may be), to find an alternative supplier of Equivalent Services to the
Testable Service in question. The exercise, by Post Office, of any of its rights under
paragraphs 6.1.1, 6.1.4 and 6.1.5 shall be without prejudice to any other rights or
remedies available to Post Office in such circumstances.

Post Office may choose to appoint an Independent Adviser to run such a competition on
its behalf, such Independent Adviser to be agreed with Fujitsu Services (such
agreement not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

Fujitsu Services shall (subject to any applicable legislation or regulations) be entitled to
participate as a tenderer in any such competition. If it participates in such competition,
Fujitsu Services shall submit its tender in the same way and to the same timescale as

Schedule D6 Version 14.0

6.6

other tenderers and shall not have access to the financial information in respect of any
other tender.

Unless Fujitsu Services exercises or intends to exercise its right under paragraph 6.3 to
participate as a tenderer in the competition, Fujitsu Services shall provide Post Office or
the Independent Adviser (as the case may be) with such assistance as may reasonably
be required to facilitate such a competition, including managing all or any part of the
competition should Post Office or the Independent Adviser ask it to do so.

Fujitsu Services shall disclose to any bona fide potential replacement provider of
Competitive Tendering Services (subject to the same executing an Agreed Form NDA or
any other form of non-disclosure agreement mutually agreed by Post Office, Fujitsu
Services and such potential replacement provider) Confidential Information to the extent
that such disclosure is reasonably required to enable that potential replacement
provider to prepare a reasonably detailed tender proposal.

Where in accordance with this paragraph 6 Post Office seeks a tender or tenders for a
third party contractor to provide Equivalent Services to those of a Competitive Tendering
Service, Fujitsu Services shall:

6.6.1 to the extent it can reasonably do so in advance (not knowing which provider
will be the winning tenderer) provide to Post Office its best estimate of any
Interface Establishment Costs likely to be incurred by Post Office in connection
with such services on the basis that the specification of the Competitive
Tendering Service and its intended replacement service are the same;

6.6.2 to the extent that any proposed third party replacement service does not meet
the specification of the Competitive Tendering Service, Fujitsu Services shall, in
a timescale consistent with the tender process, advise Post Office of the
Interface Costs likely to be incurred by Post Office in relation to the proposed
replacement service; and

6.6.3 provide to Post Office an anonymised list with details of the terms and
conditions of employment of all Fujitsu Services personnel (and those personnel
of its relevant sub-contractors) who are then wholly or mainly employed or
engaged in the performance of the Competitive Tendering Services, to the
extent such personnel may be subject to the Transfer of Undertakings
(Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006 if such Services were transferred
(including, as a minimum, information on (i) numbers of personnel (employees,
contractors and temporary staff), (ii) salaries and other benefits, bonuses and
pensions arrangements, (iii) where readily available to Fujitsu Services, skills
sets and employment grades, (iv) age and length of service profile, (v) locations
of personnel and (vi) such key employee policies as shall be generally known to
the relevant employees and relevant to their terms of employment or reasonable
expectations).

ANNEX 1
1. Introduction

This paper provides a summary of all Horizon and HNG-X Change Requests or other
agreed changes that have been raised and approved by Fujitsu Services since the date of
the HNG-X Contract and which align with the V0.80.A20 plan (as at 28th September 2009).

These Change requests are solely those that apply to the development of the initial release
of HNG-X.

Change requests that are applicable to HNG-X may also have a commercial impact. This is
managed via the Change Management process and agreed via the appropriate Change
Work Order documentation.

The process for applying the effect of the approved CRs is summarised in section 4.

The cost of any development labour in the changes listed in this document, together with
the development labour costs related to the HNG-X Initial Requirements Baseline are all
included in the HNG-X Project Price.

Status as at date of HNG-X Contract.

At the date of the HNG-X contract a number of post-S92 approved Change Requests were
agreed to be included in the POL Initial Requirements Baseline. These are listed in
Schedule B6.1 —Annex 13 and in section 2.1 below.

Current Status

Section 2.3 comprises summary details of approved CRs that have been raised subsequent
to the date of the HNG-X Contract with those that are applicable to HNG-X in section 2.3.1
and those that were signed post-CCN1246 section 2.3.2. Section 3 provides a summary of
raised but not approved CRs that may have applicability. This will be confirmed once the CR
has been approved.

Withdrawn CRs are not included in any of these lists.

This document is updated periodically with the latest approved Change Requests and
issued to POL for agreement. Subsequently POL and FS will review the newly applicable
changes and agree how they are to be applied to the HNG-X functional or non-functional

requirements.

Note — FS Change Management also provide summarised information of agreed Change
Requests to POL. This information is reconciled with the details in this paper.

SCHEDULE E
TERMINATION AND THE EXIT PLAN
41. INTRODUCTION
1.41 This Schedule E covers the principles, responsibilities and payments related to

termination of this Agreement, expiry of an Expiring Service, Partial Termination and
termination of Project HNG-X.

1.2 Termination of this Agreement

1.2.4

1.2.2

For the purpose of this Schedule E, termination of this Agreement includes:

(a) termination of this Agreement before its expiry due to Fujitsu Services’
Default pursuant to Clause 47.2;

(b) termination of this Agreement before its expiry without Fujitsu Services’
Default; and

(c) termination of this Agreement at its expiry.

Both Parties agree that the risk profile during the term of this Agreement should
remain broadly constant and that the hardware and software used to provide the
Services should be upgraded if required to remain within support. The
responsibility for procuring upgrades to hardware and software components
remains with Post Office. As such Post Office shall agree to maintain the risk
profile broadly as at the date of the CCN 1600 and that the hardware and software
used to provide the Services should be upgraded if required to remain within
support via:

(a) arevision and re-planning work with respect to R&R2 project (CT1848) (such
as using Redhat 7 operating system to ensure security to 2022) , which shall be
agreed by the Parties via a further CT document;
(b) a third risk and resilience project (referred to as “Trinity 3”); the precise detail
of which is yet to be agreed upon completion of a technical roadmap, but shall
broadly address the following:

(i) refresh of Brocade SAN switches;

(ii) refresh of 15-30 discrete servers;

(iii) refresh or upgrade of Debit Card connectivity (BT are expected
withdraw kilostream technology in 2018);

(iv) refresh or upgrade of Systems Management EFS servers (for
Horizon Anywhere Gaps proposal);

Schedule E Version 14.0

Page 2 of 41

(v) DC facilities chillers and security systems; and
(vi) Cisco and additional applications; and
in addition it may address:

(i) Oracle DB/OEL upgrade. The current version goes end of life
December 2020. All the security appliances will need refreshing. McAfee
expires December 2019, Bluecoat 2018

In scoping “Trinity 3” the following assumptions were made:

(i) the full deployment of Horizon Anywhere and the completion of
the Branch Network service migration to a third party by 31st March 2017
and the successful completion of the R&R2 programme (as amended);

(ii) An expiry date on the Agreement of 31st March 2022;

(ili) Blades & Storage (expiry range 2019-2021) — Assumption is
Fujitsu can secure extended support to March 2022. (Final agreement to
be agreed);

(iv) FCN connectivity will be available for the duration;

(v) Windows 2012 & 10 will last until March 2022 (part of current
R&R2 programme);

(vi) Horizon Anywhere Bluecoat appliances — assumed to last to
2022;

In addition, it is assumed that Fujitsu and Post Office will agree a change to the
current R&R2 programme (CT1848) to retarget RHEL7 — it is currently delivering
RHEL6.

As a consequence of assumption (ii) above, it is agreed that Trinity 3 will need to
be reviewed to include any refresh and upgrade activities required to ensure
hardware and software (including operating systems) used remain in support
through to 31st March 2023 and Post Office will be responsible for procuring (and
paying for) any additional hardware and software (including operating system).;
and

(c) the extension of Test Rigs, as described and defined in CCN 1420a, to 31
March 2022.

Both Post Office and Fujitsu Services shall act reasonably in agreeing the above
projects. In the event that the Parties fail to reach agreement as to the commercial
terms and/or the relevant project is cancelled or the Test Rigs service is
terminated, then to the extent to which the Services are impacted by this failure
and/or termination, such Services shall be delivered by Fujitsu Services on a

reasonable endeavours basis and all associated Service Levels shall also
become reasonable endeavours obligations.

1.2.3 Notwithstanding paragraph 1.2.2, both parties acknowledge that they may agree to
an alternative approach (both acting reasonably) to enacting a third R&R project
and as such use the capital investment from the Post Office in other ways. This
shall be subject to the agreement by both Parties and the default position shall
remain (unless otherwise agreed) that where these projects are not contracted or
delivered, the delivery of the affected Service reverts to a reasonable endeavours
basis.

1.2.4 With respect to the Oracle database elements of the Data Centre Operations
Services only, in the event that the Oracle database goes out of Oracle extended
support then the provisions of paragraph 6.1 of Schedule D1 shall apply.

1.3 Partial Termination

1.3.1 For the purpose of this Schedule E, Partial Termination includes:

(a) termination by Post Office of one or more Terminable Service(s) in
relation to Market Testing pursuant to Clause 47.10.1 (where paragraph

4.3.3(b)(ii) of Schedule D6 applies); and

(b) termination by Post Office of one or more Terminable Service(s) for
convenience pursuant to Clause 47.10.2;

14 Termination of Project HNG-X
1.4.1 For the purpose of this Schedule E, termination of Project HNG-X includes:

(a) termination of Project HNG-X due to Fujitsu Services’ Default pursuant to
Clause 47.11.1;

(b) termination of Project HNG-X for convenience pursuant to Clause

47.11.2;

1.5 In any of the termination scenarios set out in paragraphs 1.2 and 1.3 (but not in the case

of termination of Project HNG-X as referred to in paragraph 1.4) Post Office may seek to
obtain the delivery of Replacement Services under this Agreement or seek to continue
the Relevant Services after termination, in each case either by performing them itself or
by means of the Next Supplier.

1.6 The Parties acknowledge that it is their overall objective in relation to termination of the
Agreement, expiry of an Expiring Service and Partial Termination to procure, so far as is
reasonable and practicable, that there shall be an orderly transfer of responsibilities for
the delivery of the Relevant Services provided under this Agreement or an orderly and
efficient transition from the provision of the Relevant Services to the provision of

CONFIDENTIAL

2.1

2.2

Replacement Services (as the case may be) to the Next Supplier and that any risk to or
adverse effect on the continuity and quality of the Services during such transfer shall be
minimised.

The purpose of this Schedule E is to:
1.7.1 set out certain principles governing Partial Termination;

1.7.2 set out the main steps to be followed on termination of this Agreement, Partial
Termination and/or termination of Project HNG-X;

1.7.3 set out the assistance that Fujitsu Services shall, and in the case of Paragraph
3,15 may, provide to Post Office and/or its Next Supplier with the intention of
helping them (if it is Post Office's chosen strategy to do so) put themselves in a
position to commence performance of Replacement Services promptly upon
expiry of this Agreement or as soon as reasonably practicable after completion of
any period of notice of termination given by Post Office to Fujitsu Services; and

1.7.4 set out the Parties’ obligations with respect to the development and maintenance
of the Exit Strategy and the Exit Plans.

Notwithstanding any provisions of this Schedule E to the contrary, if this Agreement is
terminated for Post Office Default under Clause 47.4, Fujitsu Services shall not be obliged
to develop or implement the General Exit Plan or the HNG-X Exit Plan.

PARTIAL TERMINATION

Partial Termination Principles

Post Office shall not be entitled to terminate any Terminable Service under Clause 47.10.1
or 47.10.2 prior to the date or event specified in relation to that Terminable Service in the
column headed “Date or Event from which termination can be effective.” in the table set
out in Annex 1 of this Schedule E.

Following service of a notice duly served under Clause 47.10.1 or 47.10.2, the Parties
shall assess the impact of the relevant Partial Termination upon the rest of this Agreement
in order to agree under the Change Control Procedure (such agreement not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) any consequential changes to this Agreement

without limitation, the changes necessary to address:

2.2.1 the relevant indicative impacts listed in the table at Annex 1 to this Schedule E;
2.2.2 relevant dependencies and interfaces with other Operational Services identified

in the CCD (referred to in Schedule B3.1) that describes the Terminable Service
to be terminated;

2.2.3. the impact on Fujitsu Services’ ability to achieve any Service Level or other
obligations the achievement of which is linked to or dependent upon the
Terminable Service to be terminated;

2.2.4 any dependencies that Post Office shall fulfil or responsibilities that Post Office
shall perform in relation to the impacts referred to in paragraphs 2.2.1, 2.2.2 or
2.2.3;

2.2.5 the transfer pursuant to Clause 48 of ownership of any Project Assets from Fujitsu
Services to Post Office or the Next Supplier, the removal of such assets from the
Infrastructure and any consequent transfer of liability or risk in respect of such
Project Assets;

2.2.6 as contemplated by Clause 43.4, any qualifications and/or exceptions to Clause
43.1 necessary to reflect the transfer of risk and/or control in relation to system
or operational security from Fujitsu Services to Post Office or the Next Supplier
taking into account:

(a) any new security related responsibilities taken on by Post Office pursuant
to paragraph 2.2.4; and

(b) the level of security provided by the Replacement Interfaces; and

2.2.7 the matters referred to in paragraph 2.5.2, if Post Office shall have given a
direction pursuant to paragraph 2.5.

In the case of Partial Termination pursuant to Clause 47.10.1 (where paragraph
4.3.3(b)(ii) of Schedule D6 applies), the objective of paragraph 2.2 shall insofar as it
relates to this Agreement be to give effect to the supply by the winning tenderer to Post
Office of Replacement Services and documenting the technical and operational interfaces
between those Replacement Services and the continuing Services provided by Fujitsu
Services based on the specifications for such interfaces that formed part of the tender
process and were prepared with Fujitsu Services’ input and assistance pursuant to
paragraphs 6.4 to 6.6 (inclusive) of Schedule D6.

If and to the extent that the Parties fail to reach agreement under the Change Control
Procedure pursuant to paragraph 2.2 by the date the Terminable Service in question is
terminated:

2.4.1 the Parties shall each use all reasonable endeavours to reach agreement such
that all the matters referred to in paragraph 2.2 are addressed;

2.4.2 with effect from the date of such termination, Fujitsu Services shall perform the
obligations and achieve the Service Levels applicable in relation to all continuing
Services ("Continuing Obligations") to the extent it reasonably can do so, taking
into account those aspects of the performance of that Terminable Service upon
which Fujitsu Services’ performance of the Continuing Obligations depends; and

2.4.3 to the extent such failure to reach agreement is in relation to the qualifications or
exceptions to Clause 43.1 referred to in paragraph 2.2.6 or security related
responsibilities to be performed by Post Office, with effect from the date of such
termination Post Office shall be responsible for ensuring to the extent that it or a
Next Supplier:

(a) establishes the Replacement Interfaces, that the Replacement Interfaces
are secure; and/or

(b) operates or provides technical or service linkages to the Replacement
Interfaces, that such operation and linkages are performed in a secure
manner,

care and diligence that would be reasonably expected to be applied in relation to
the relevant Replacement Service taken on by a supplier of IT services using
good industry practice and adopting any enhanced security measures that such
a supplier could reasonably be expected to adopt if such supplier provided an
indemnity to Post Office in the same form as that set out in Clause 43.1 (but
subject to the same limitations or exclusions of liability set out in Clauses 43 and
44) in respect of the provision of that Replacement Service.

Any Disputes in relation to this paragraph 2.4 shall be resolved in accordance with the
Dispute Resolution Procedure.

4.3.3(b)(ii) of Schedule D6 applies) the Parties may agree or Post Office may direct that
Fujitsu Services as the provider of the Third Party Management Services shall be
responsible for the management of the provision by the winning tenderer of the
Replacement Services, in which case:

provision of the Third Party Management Services in respect of such
Replacement Services shall be as set out in paragraph 9 of Schedule D1; and

2.5.2 any variations that may be required to the provisions in this Agreement relating to
the Third Party Management Services to give effect to such direction by Post
Office shall be agreed under the Change Control Procedure. In the absence of
such agreement the provisions of the CCD entitled "Third Party Management
Service: Service Description" (SVM/SDM/SD/0021) shall apply.

Interface Costs
Interface Costs incurred following Partial Termination shall be borne as follows:

3.1 The Asset Register, Exit Strategy and Exit Plans shall be developed and maintained in
accordance with this paragraph 3.

3.2 Phase One

3.2.1

3.2.2

between 1 April 2007 and three months after the date of commencement of HNG-
X Project Workstream X3 (HNG-X Pilot and Acceptance), Fujitsu Services shall
(which in respect of the Terminable Services individually, shall mean to the extent
reasonably possible) update the list of assets in each of the categories of assets
identified in the CCD entitled “Transfer Asset Register” (COM/MGT/REP/0001)

activities which the Parties agree are required in relation to termination of
this Agreement, Partial Termination and/or termination of Project HNG-X,
the detail of such activities to be included in the appropriate Exit Plan in
Phase Two.

3.2.3. The Exit Strategy shall:

(a) set out a generic description of all probable post termination scenarios
relevant to this Agreement (each an “Exit Scenario”) including, without
limitation, the following:

(i)

(ii)

(iii)

full or partial continuation of services substantially the same as
the Relevant Services by the Next Supplier;

full or partial provision of equivalent services by the Next Supplier
fully or partially utilising the Infrastructure;

full or partial provision of equivalent services by the Next Supplier
utilising an entirely new infrastructure; and

(iv) continued provision of the Services by Fujitsu Services following
termination of Project HNG-X;
(b) identify the major factors which are common to all the Exit Scenarios and

those which occur in some only of the Exit Scenarios;

(c) set out the roles and responsibilities of the Parties in the development of
the Exit Plans in Phase Two;

distinguishing between those categories which will be required in
all probable Exit Scenarios and those which will be required only
in particular Exit Scenarios; and

the sources of such information and how it will be provided.

and the Exit Strategy established in accordance with paragraph 3.2.2, the Parties
shall thereafter jointly review and update the Asset Register and/or the Exit
Strategy once in every twelve months or if the Commercial Leads decide it is
necessary to do so as a result of significant changes to the Services. If the Asset
Register or the Exit Strategy is brought up to date following a change to the
Services, then that document need not be brought up to date for a further twelve
months unless the Commercial Leads decide otherwise.

Fujitsu Services shall provide an updated version of the Asset Register to Post
Office by 30" April 2013 which they shall keep up to date throughout the
remainder of the Term in accordance with the terms of the Agreement.

Fujitsu Services shall provide an updated version of the Exit Strategy document
to Post Office by 31st October 2013, such version to take into account Post
Office's intention to transition to a Towers Model.

For the avoidance of doubt, Fujitsu Services shall not charge Post Office for the
production of the updated versions of the Asset Register and Exit Strategy in
accordance with paragraphs 3.3.1 and 3.3.2 above.

Exit Plans for transition

Fujitsu Services shall, within 2 months of receipt of a request from Post Office,
provide to Post Office part 1 of the Exit Plan (excluding aspects of the Exit Plan
which are dependent on the identity of the Next Supplier) for such Services as
Post Office may specify.

Fujitsu Services shall provide to Post Office part 2 of the Exit Plan (including
aspects of the Exit Plan which are dependent on the identity of the Next Supplier)
following notification to Fujitsu Services by Post Office as to who the Next
Supplier is and the nature of the transition process that Post Office and the Next
Provider requires. Fujitsu Services shall provide part 2 of the Exit Plan within 2
months of receipt of this notification from Post Office provided that, subject to
paragraph 3.4.3 below, such notification is received 2 months or longer after the
date the request for the part one of the Exit Plan was made in accordance with
paragraph 3.4.1 (i.e. the creation of part one of the Exit Plan and part two of the
Exit Plan shall not run concurrently). For the avoidance of doubt, Post Office
shall provide this information on or before the date it gives written notice of
termination of the Terminable Service.

For the avoidance of doubt, Post Office may elect to request only part 2 of the
Exit Plan (without requesting part 1) by notifying Fujitsu Services who the Next
Supplier is and the nature of the transition process that Post Office and the Next
Provider requires. In the event that Post Office requests part 2 of the Exit Plan
only, Fujitsu Services shall provide such Exit Plan in accordance with paragraph
3.4.2 above including all aspects of the Exit Plan which are dependent and which
are not dependent on the identity of the Next Supplier.

Post Office shall not make a request for an Exit Plan for the following Services in
accordance with paragraph 3.4.1 or 3.4.2 above earlier than

(a) for an Expiring Service, 24 months prior to the expiry date of such Expiring

Service;

(b) for a Service other than an Expiring Service, 36 months prior to the expiry
date of such Service;

in the Agreement (including but not limited to keeping documentation up to date) such
costs shall be recoverable from the Post Office.”

responsible for liaising with and ensuring the co-operation of such Next Supplier in all
planning and handover activities in respect of exit transition and where obligations in the

Where, other than in accordance with paragraph 6 of Schedule D6, the Post Office is
seeking a tender or tenders for a third party contractor to provide a Replacement Service

intends to provide such Replacement Services itself, Fujitsu Services shall:

Office reasonably requests. Fujitsu Services shall be entitled to charge for the collation
(including any changes to the format of the data, if any) and provision of this data in
accordance with the Rate Card as an Exit service.

5.4.2 In the event that the Post Office does not elect to purchase all of the Equipment
forming part of the Project Assets in accordance with its right under Clause 48.1, then:

destruction of associated disks and shall provide Post Office with a certificate of
destruction within seven (7) days’ of the date of destruction. Fujitsu Services shall
be entitled to charge for the destruction of such data and associated disks as an

continuing to hold the data;

b) Fujitsu Services shall redeploy and/or dispose of such Equipment forming part of
the Project Assets in accordance with its legal obligations and shall not charge
Post Office for such redeployment and/or disposal.

extent to which they apply to the audit trail relating to Transactions or Events.

9. ADDITIONAL EXIT PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO TRANSITION
9.1 Impact of termination or expiry during transition

9.1.1. From 1st April 2015, it is anticipated that Post Office will initiate a number of
Partial Terminations of Services as it moves to its new procurement model. To
support the transition following these Partial Terminations there may be a
resulting change in the scope and charging for the central support Services
(Service Management Service, Management Information Service, and Security
Management Service). In addition, the Services may be impacted by the
termination or expiry of the Engineering Service, Operational Business Change
Service and CMT Service.

9.1.2 The impact of any Partial Termination on the remaining Services shall be
assessed in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2.2 of Schedule E.

9.1.3. The impact of any expiry of an Expiring Service shall be assessed in
accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2.2 of Schedule E.

9.1.4 As part of any termination or expiry of any Services it is agreed that as part of
impacting the remaining Services the Parties shall review the applicability of the
Call Off Services in Table B in Schedule B3.1.

9.2 Spares Stock

9.2.1 Post Office shall be responsible for the provision of all spares stock for Expiring
Services (excluding POLSAP Applications Support Service, and Branch Network
Services) from 1st April 2015 until 23:59 on the 4" October 2016 at 23:59. From
5 October 2016 Post Office shall be responsible for the provision of all spares
stock for Expiring Services (excluding Branch Network Resilience Service and
Branch Network Services). For the avoidance of doubt, all spares stock
procured by or on behalf of Post Office shall form part of the Branch
Infrastructure.

9.2.2 Post Office may request in writing that Fujitsu Services source the spares stock
for Branch Infrastructure on Post Office's behalf (including spares stock identified
in a Mini Extension Report). In such circumstances and subject to the availability
of such spares, Fujitsu Services shall procure said spares at Post Office's cost.
Fujitsu Services shall also be entitled to charge for the storage of these spares.
In the event that Post Office extends the Engineering Service, Fujitsu Services
shall not be entitled to charge for those spares that it estimates it will require to
deliver the Services during the period for which the Engineering Service is
extended. Fujitsu Services will continue to be able to charge for the storage of
any other spares procured on behalf of Post Office during such period.

It is noted that at the time of entering into CCN 1400, both parties acknowledge that it is
not possible to predetermine all of the potential impact (including changes to the
relevant cost base) of the removal of the Service Desk Service and the impact of the
removal of other subsequent Terminable Services (whether before or after 31st March
2015) on the remaining Operational Services. To this end, the provisions of paragraph
2 (Partial Termination) of Schedule E (Termination and the Exit Plan) shall apply in
each instances and Fujitsu Services shall be required to impact each expiry and/or
termination and the Charges for the remaining services shall be varied according to any
increase or decrease in the remaining costs incurred by Fujitsu Services in delivery of
the remaining services. Any resultant reduction in Fujitsu Services’ costs shall be
deducted from the relevant Operational Charge but no additional deduction will be
made for the margin originally added to that cost. Any resultant increase in Fujitsu
Services’ costs shall be added to the relevant Operational Charge but this additional
charge shall not form part of the calculation for any future Termination Charge.

MINI EXTENSIONS

In the event that Post Office requires any or all of the Expiring Services (excluding
Credence/MDM Service, the Salesforce Support Service, POLSAP Hosting Service and
POLSAP Applications Support Service) to continue beyond 31st March 2015, then the
following provisions shall apply:

10.1.1 Post Office shall only be able to extend a particular service for fixed 6 month
periods. In the event that Post Office requires an additional period beyond 30th
September 2015 then Post Office must also elect for an additional fixed 6 month
extension period.

10.1.2 In order to extend one of these Expiring Services (excluding POLSAP
Applications Support Services), Post Office shall give a minimum of 6 months’
written notice, i.e. in the first instance, such written notice must be received by
Fujitsu Services prior to 30th September 2014.

10.1.3 For the avoidance of doubt, liquidated damages (where applicable) shall continue
to apply during any mini extension in accordance with clause 18.

10.1.3A The Credence/MDM service, the Salesforce Support Service and POLSAP.
Hosting Service are not extendable beyond 31% March 2015 in accordance with

Schedule E Version 14.0

the terms above. The POLSAP Applications Support Service is not extendable
beyond 318 March 2016 in accordance with the terms above.

10.1.3B In the event that the Service Desk Service continues beyond 31st March 2015,

there shall be no reduction in contracted for Service Levels during the extended
period.

10.1.5

10.1.8

10.1.9

From 5" October 2016 Fujitsu Services shall, acting as the informed supplier,
ensure that its personnel inform the Service Management Relationship (as
defined in Schedule A2) as soon as it is aware of any issues that may impact
on the provision of Expiring Services (be it by Fujitsu Services or the Next
Supplier) on a reactive basis. Where such issues are agreed they shall be
formally recorded in the minutes and become Refresh Items. If agreement is
not reached in the Service Management Relationship then the Parties shall
escalate the matter using the Dispute Resolution Procedure.

Additionally, to inform the mini extension request Post Office may elect to
commission via a CT, a report identifying any items of risk that would need to
be addressed in order for the relevant Service(s) to continue to operate during
any Mini Extension in accordance with the Agreement immediately prior to the
extension. This report shall be prepared on a pro-active basis with Fujitsu
Services consulting relevant sub-contractors as necessary. Such report shall be
delivered to Post Office within 3 months of the agreement date of the CT (the
“Mini Extension Report”). The report shall be delivered on a time and
materials basis but the cost of such report shall be capped at £30,000.

Post Office will review the Mini Extension Report and the Parties shall use
reasonable endeavours to agree any changes within 15 Working Days of the
date the Mini Extension Report is delivered to Post Office. If the Parties are
unable to agree the report then the matter shall be escalated via the existing
Dispute Resolution Procedure.

Once agreed, any items identified in the Mini Extension Report shall be deemed
to be Refresh Items.

If matters relating to potential Refresh Items have been referred to the Dispute
Resolution Procedure but not yet resolved and result in a service failure during
any mini extension period, then the potential Refresh Items attributable to the
service failure shall become Refresh Items.

Post Office may at its sole option determine whether to implement all, some, or
none of the Refresh Items set out in the Mini Extension Report and/or Service
Management Relationship minutes and/or Dispute Resolution Procedure
resolutions. For the avoidance of doubt, Post Office may purchase Refresh
Items from any Tower Contractor or any other third party but, as set out in
Schedule B1 (Branch Hardware Implementation) only Fujitsu Services may
implement such Refresh Items into the Services (at Post Office's additional
cost, where such costs are not recoverable under the Charges) to the extent it
still provides the applicable Service. In the event that Post Office decides to
proceed with some or none of the Refresh Items then Fujitsu Services shall not
be liable for any service failure directly attributable to Post Office not
proceeding with and/or making available the Refresh Items. In the event that
Post Office decides to proceed with some or all of the Refresh Items then, for
the avoidance of doubt, Fujitsu Services' obligations to provide the Services in
accordance with the Service Levels shall be unaffected to the extent to which
Post Office procures and/or provides the Refresh Items within the agreed
timescales.

10.1.10 Furthermore, if Post Office does not elect to procure the Mini Extension Report

and to the extent that Fujitsu Services has fulfilled its obligations under

paragraph 10.1.4 of this Schedule E, then, should the service be impacted by
the non-availability, refresh or support of hardware and software, or of spares
after 31st March 2015 an appropriate adjustment to service level performance

shall be made in relation to failures directly caused by the lack of availability,
refresh or support of those spares, hardware or software.

SPARES STOCK

Prior to the termination/expiry of any of the Services, Fujitsu Services will notify Post
Office promptly after it becomes aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware), of
any:

10A.2.1 software or hardware used in the performance of the Services; or
10A.2.2 spares stocks for Branch Infrastructure,

which is becoming end-of-life and/or coming out of support in the two years after the
planned expiry of the Service.

From 5" October 2016, Post Office shall be responsible for the provision of all spares
stock from 1* April 2015 required for the provision of Expiring Services. For the
avoidance of doubt, Post Office may request that Fujitsu Services source the spares
stock on Post Office's behalf. In such circumstances and subject to the availability of
such spares, Fujitsu Services shall procure said spares at Post Office's cost. Fujitsu
Services shall also be entitled to charge for the storage of these spares.

In the event that Post Office extends the Engineering Service, Fujitsu Services shall not
be entitled to charge for those spares that it estimates it will require to deliver the
Services during the period for which the Engineering Service is extended. Fujitsu
Services will continue to be able to charge for the storage of any other spares procured
on behalf of Post Office during such period where such spares are stored by Fujitsu
Services.

RAMP DOWN CHARGES

Once a particular Operational Service, Counter Positions or Branches is/are supported
by a Next Supplier or any other supplier (and not Fujitsu) it/they shall cease to be
“Counter Positions” or “Branches” for such Operational Service.

For the avoidance of doubt, a single Branch or Counter Position may be supported by
Fujitsu in relation to one Operational Service but may be supported by a Next Supplier
in relation to another Operational Service. As illustrated in the example in paragraph
1.9 of Schedule D1, that Branch or Counter Position supported by Fujitsu would be
included in the variable charge calculation for the Operational Service but not the
Branch or Counter Position supported by the Next Supplier.

Both Parties acknowledge that Post Office may request further extensions to the
Expiring Services. Both Parties agree to act reasonably in the event of any such
request and any associated negotiation of terms. In particular, Fujitsu Services agrees
to mitigate its costs of supply and stranded costs with respect to any further extension of
the Expiring Services to the extent that it is reasonably possible to do so having regard
to, amongst other things, the timing of any request relative to the expiry date of the
Expiring Services

Key Objectives of the Towers Model, Fujitsu Services Collaboration Requirements and
Responsibilities

In the event of any conflict between this Schedule F and the Agreement, the provisions of the
Agreement (including any Service Descriptions) shall prevail.

1. KEY OBJECTIVES OF THE TOWERS MODEL

Fujitsu Services acknowledges that the key objectives of Post Office's Towers Model are set out
at paragraphs 1.1 to 1.9 below and that it shall facilitate and not negatively impede those key
objectives where relevant. For the avoidance of doubt, Fujitsu Services is not, for the purposes
of this Agreement a Tower Contractor.

11 Each Tower Contractor understands the need to form and conduct collaborative
partnerships with any and all other Tower Contractors in accordance with Good Industry
Practice.

1.2 The relationships between all Tower Contractors support and deliver effective, efficient,
fit for purpose, stable and operable services to Post Office to the agreed levels and quality of
service for those services.

1.3 The governance frameworks and delivery organisations applicable to all services
delivered to Post Office are proactive and supportive, taking a collaborative approach to
knowledge and skills sharing, benefiting Post Office and the Tower Contractors.

1.4 Each Tower Contractor delivers services using an integrated (through strong interfaces),
innovative and strategic approach in accordance with Good Industry Practice. Such approach
carried out by each Tower Contractor shall include (but not be limited to) the use of appropriate
and cost effective tools, properly skilled and experienced staff, and continuous improvement
strategies.

1.5 Each Tower Contractor is focussed on maintaining, delivering and improving user
support, user experience, and customer satisfaction in relation to any and all services. Each
Tower Contractor acknowledges that the maintenance, delivery and improvement of such
factors or items are critical to the effectiveness of any and all services provided to Post Office.

1.7 Each Tower Contractor shall work with Post Office (and other Tower Contractors, as
appropriate) to enable and further improve proper and robust assurance regimes in relation to
the delivery of services by Tower Contractors in accordance with agreed service requirements
and service levels for those services.

1.8 Where a Tower Contractor's activities in relation to the provision of any services have a
significant bearing on the activities of any other Tower Contractors or any potential providers of
services, that Tower Contractor shall act in good faith and in the best interests of Post Office,
and shall act in an unbiased manner in relation to any other such Tower Contractors or any
potential providers of services.

1.9 Each Tower Contractor shall conduct its activities in relation to any services it provides
in order to support Post Office to achieve benefits including, but not limited to, the following:

(a) Asustainable run rate reduction in costs throughout the lifetime of each applicable
contract between that Tower Contractor and Post Office;

(b) Enablement of Post Office to deliver on and support Post Office's strategic plan
(whether relating to Post Office's ICT or business strategies);

(c) Enhancement of the capability of Post Office IT&C;

(d) Creation of a post-transformation Post Office IT&C organisation that is business
focused, responsive and flexible;

(e) Enhancement of the quality of services provided by Post Office IT&C to its customers or
users;

and all services are delivered to Post Office (including the use of new technologies,

SCHEDULE H
Digital Intellectual Property Provisions
1. Post Office will own all IP Rights in the Deliverables created and/or developed by or on behalf of Fujitsu

Services solely or jointly with Post Office on or after the Digital Start Date, save for the Listed Rights
and the rights referred to in paragraph 4 below (the “Digital IPR").

2. Fujitsu Services now assigns to Post Office absolutely with full title guarantee free from any charge,
lien, encumbrance or other right in favour of any third party all present and future right, title and interest
in and to any and all Digital IPR. This assignment includes the right to bring, make, oppose, defend,
appeal proceedings, claims or actions and obtain relief (and to retain any damages recovered) in
respect of any infringement, or any other cause of action arising from ownership, of any of the Digital
IPR whether occurring before, on, or after the date of this Agreement.

3. Without prejudice to paragraph 2, Fujitsu Services shall procure assignments from all Project
Consultants to Fujitsu Services (on similar terms to those set out in paragraph 2) of any Digital IPR to
be created by any Project Consultants prior to any engagement of any Project Consultant. Such
assignments shall also include waivers of moral rights.

4. Nothing in this Schedule shall prevent Fujitsu Services or Post Office from using data-processing
techniques, ideas and know-how gained during the performance of the Services in the furtherance of
its normal business including by its customers in connection with the delivery and use of its services,
(which shall for the avoidance of doubt entitle Post Office to use such data-processing techniques,
ideas and know-how for the same scope of activities as referred to in paragraph 8) to the extent that
this does not amount to a disclosure of Confidential Information or an infringement by Post Office or
Fujitsu Services of any IP Rights.

5. The Digital IPR shall not include:

a. any IP Rights created by or on behalf of Fujitsu Services (or any of its Group Companies from
time to time) prior to the Digital Start Date ;

b. any IP Rights created by or on behalf of Fujitsu Services (or any of its Group Companies from
time to time) at any time which have arisen other than from Fujitsu Services’ provision of the
Services;

c. the Horizon IPR (to which the ownership and licensing provisions under the Agreement shall
continue to apply);

d. the K5 IPR (which is proprietary to and shall remain owned by Fujitsu Services) including any
intellectual property rights in any developments to the Fujitsu K5 Platform whether or not created
or developed on or after the Digital Start Date; and/or

e. any third party IP Rights (other than those assigned to Post Office pursuant to paragraph 2 of this
Schedule),
(collectively the “Listed Rights’).
6. Post Office now grants to Fujitsu Services a non-exclusive, fully paid-up, worldwide licence to use the

Digital IPR solely in connection with the Services and to deliver any related services to Post Office.

Schedule H Version 14.0
Page 2 of 7
FUJ00234786
FUJ00234786

CONFIDENTIAL

For the avoidance of doubt, the licences granted to Fujitsu Services by Post Office under Clause 31
of the Agreement shall continue to apply.

7. Fujitsu Services shall comply with the Agile Process put in place between the parties and the agreed
design principles. The Agile Process shall include as a minimum, backlog, stories, tasks and test plans.
Fujitsu Services shall ensure that all personnel working on the Services are aware of the design
principles and brief all personnel working on the Services to designate for each Deliverable if it is to
be designed, coded or supplied as a pre-existing component or algorithm using any Listed Rights.
Post Office's Chief Technical Officer (or nominated representative) may agree (at Post Office's sole
discretion) the use of any Listed Rights through the assurance and acceptance work flow in the Agile
Process. Both of the parties shall comply with the Agile Process and shall operate the Agile Process
to ensure that any Listed Rights in any Deliverable (or part) and any modifications and/or updates
thereto are identified and that such information is and remains recorded and readily accessible to both
parties in a format to be agreed by the parties acting reasonably.

8. To the extent that Fujitsu Services incorporates any FJ Digital Background IPR in any Deliverables,
Fujitsu Services now grants to Post Office a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid-up,
worldwide licence under such FJ Digital Background IPR as is incorporated in the Deliverables (but
excluding any Horizon IPR and any K5 IPR which shall be dealt with in accordance with paragraph 11
below) to use, support, maintain, enhance, modify and develop the Deliverables for Post Office's and
Post Office's Affiliates’ business purposes only (which shall include, for the avoidance of doubt but
without limitation, the use of the Deliverables by or on behalf of British Forces Post Office and use of
the Deliverables by or behalf of Post Office's franchisees and agents) with the right to grant sub-
licences (strictly within the scope of Post Office's own licence) through multiple tiers, for the purpose
of using, copying, modifying, adapting, advancing and developing the Deliverables, in both object code
and source code formats solely for and on behalf of Post Office provided always that, for the avoidance
of doubt, Post Office and the Post Office Affiliates shall not under any circumstances sell or transfer
the Deliverables to third parties (other than to Post Office Affiliates) or otherwise market or
commercially exploit the Deliverables by permitting third parties (other than Post Office Affiliates) to
use the Deliverables for their own business and other purposes.

9. Nothing in paragraphs 7 and/or 8 above, including any failure by Fujitsu Services to comply with
paragraphs 7 and/or 8, shall impact on Fujitsu Services (or Post Office's and/or any third party's)
ownership of any of the Listed Rights.

10. To the extent that Fujitsu Services incorporates any Horizon IPR in the Deliverables in accordance
with paragraph 7, the Horizon IPR owned by Fujitsu Services shall continue to be licensed to Post
Office in accordance with the Agreement and shall not be included in the licence granted in accordance
with paragraph 8 above. The parties agree that no K5 IPR shall be incorporated into the Deliverables.
To the extent that any K5 IPR is created and/or developed, whether before, on or after the Digital Start
Date, it shall be vested in and solely owned by Fujitsu Services and Post Office shall not be charged
for such creation and/or development work.

41. The parties agree that if at any time Fujitsu Services has incorporated any Horizon IPR owned by
Fujitsu Services into any Deliverables without the agreement of Post Office in accordance with
paragraph 7 above (the “Unapproved Horizon IPR’), in relation to that Unapproved Horizon IPR, the
licence granted to Post Office in respect of the Horizon Software IPR in accordance with the Agreement
shall be extended to a licence to use the Unapproved Horizon IPR from the point of its incorporation
into any Deliverables on terms essentially equivalent to those specified in Clauses 30.19.5.1 and
30.19.5.2 of the Agreement (subject to the limitations specified in this paragraph 11) and it is agreed
that the early grant of such licence in respect of the Unapproved Horizon IPR shall not avoid any of
the fees payable on expiry of the Agreement on 31 March 2023 in accordance with Clause 30.19.1 of
the Agreement or on termination of the Agreement in accordance with Clauses 30.19.2, 30.19.3 and/or

Schedule H Version 14.0

FUJ00234786

CONFIDENTIAL

30.19.4.0f the Agreement which shall remain fully due and payable but shall not be increased by the
grant of the licence provided under this paragraph 11. Nothing in this paragraph 11 or elsewhere in
this Schedule shall alter Post Office's obligations under the Agreement including without limitation its
obligation to pay the Expiry Licence Fee or Termination Licence Fee as applicable.

12. To the extent that following agreement by Post Office in accordance with paragraph 7 above Fujitsu
Services incorporates any third party IP Rights in the Deliverables, Fujitsu Services shall use
reasonable endeavours to procure a licence to Post Office of such third party IP Rights substantially
on the terms set out in paragraph 8 of this Schedule or on such other reasonable terms as may be
agreed between Post Office and such third party. Provided Post Office's Chief Technical Officer (or
nominated representative) has agreed to the incorporation of any such third party IP Rights in the
Deliverables, any licence or other fees required to be paid to such third parties shall be paid by Post
Office.

13. Fujitsu Services confirms that the Deliverables shall not include any third party IP Rights save as
agreed in accordance with paragraph 7 above.

14. Subject to paragraphs 16 and 17 below, Fujitsu Services shall indemnify and keep indemnified Post
Office from and against all claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs and/or expenses (including,
without limitation, properly incurred legal expenses) incurred by or awarded against the Post Office
arising out of and/or in connection with a claim made by a third party alleging that the use of the
Deliverables or the Services as provided by Fujitsu Services, infringes or otherwise misappropriates
the IP Rights of a third party (an “IPR Claim”) PROVIDED THAT Post Office will:

a. promptly on becoming aware of an IPR Claim give written notice of the IPR Claim to Fujitsu
Services specifying the nature of the IPR Claim in reasonable detail;

b. not make any admission of liability, agreement or compromise in relation to the IPR Claim without
Fujitsu Services' prior written consent;

c. allow Fujitsu Services to assume the control and conduct of the defence and settlement of the
IPR Claim (save that Fujitsu Services shall not make any admission of liability or fault on the part
of Post Office without Post Office's prior written consent);

d. at the expense of Fujitsu Services, give such reasonable assistance and take such action as may
reasonably be required by Fujitsu Services in the defence, settlement or compromise of the IPR
Claim.

Any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs and/or expenses (including, without limitation, properly
incurred legal expenses) incurred by or awarded against Post Office's Affiliates or sub-licensees shall
be deemed those of Post Office and accordingly shall be recoverable pursuant to this clause 14, but
only to the extent that such Affiliates and sub-licensees have made use of the Deliverables and
Services in relation to Post Office products and services.

15. Without prejudice to paragraph 14, in the event of an IPR Claim, Fujitsu Services may at its sole
election and at its cost:

a. modify the element of the Deliverables and/or Services provided by Fujitsu Services as necessary
to avoid such a claim, provided the element of the Deliverables and/or Services (as amended)
function in substantially the same way as those Deliverables and/or Services before modification;
or

b. procure for the Post Office, its Affiliates and any sub-licensees a licence from the relevant third
party to continue using the Deliverables and/or Services provided by Fujitsu Services ‘as is’; or

Schedule H Version 14.0
Page 4 of 7
FUJ00234786
FUJ00234786

CONFIDENTIAL

c. replace the element of the Deliverables and/or Services with non-infringing elements.

Where Fujitsu Services reasonably believes that an IPR Claim has a reasonable chance of success,
Fujitsu Services shall promptly undertake one of the options set out at 15(a), (b) or (c), with the decision
as to which option is undertaken being at Fujitsu's sole election and cost.

16. The parties acknowledge and agree that:

a. Fujitsu Services shall not be liable under paragraph 14 to the extent an IPR Claim results from
any enhancements, modifications and/or developments made by or on behalf of Post Office or by
‘or on behalf of its Affiliates and /or sub-licensees and/or other users of the Deliverables and/or
Services to the Deliverables without Fujitsu's prior written approval or to the extent any such IPR
Claim results from any failure by Post Office, Post Office Affiliates, Post Office sub-licensees
and/or other users of the Deliverables and/or Services to comply with any reasonable instructions
or system requirements relating to use of the relevant Deliverables that are communicated to Post
Office in writing prior to the date of delivery of the relevant Deliverables to Post Office, in each
case provided that such infringement would have been avoided by the use of the Deliverables not
so enhanced, modified or developed or otherwise by using the Deliverables in accordance with
such reasonable instructions or system requirements;

b. to the extent that an IPR Claim is made by a third party alleging that the use of any element of
the Deliverables in which Horizon IPR subsists, infringes or otherwise misappropriates the IP
Rights of a third party and such Horizon IPR is capable of separate identification, the indemnities
set out in the Agreement including at Clauses 30.19.9 and 34.1 shall apply to such extent;

c. Fujitsu Services shall not be liable under Clause 14 to the extent an IPR Claim is attributable to
possession or use of the Deliverables (or any part thereof) by Post Office other than in accordance
with the terms of CT225a, use of the Deliverables in combination with any hardware or software
not supplied or specified by Fujitsu Services, or otherwise agreed in writing between the parties,
if the infringement would have been avoided by the use of the Deliverables not so combined;

d. the intention of the parties is, and has been, that any Digital IPR is not considered to be Post
Office Foreground IPR for the purposes of paragraphs 14 to 16;

e. Post Office shall use reasonable endeavours to mitigate its internal costs and expenses relating
to any IPR Claim;

f. no person or entity other than Post Office shall be entitled to claim under the indemnity set out
above; and

Revenue Switch Mechanism

OVERVIEW

Paragraph 4.7 of CCN 1600 set out a joint intention of Post Office and Fujitsu Services to
evolve the Services under this Agreement to reflect Post Office’s changing business
requirements and also in line with new technology.

Through a joint initiative, Post Office and Fujitsu Services identified and agreed a number of
areas of this Agreement to be updated and Services to be evolved in line with this joint
intention, such initiative being referred to as “Project Everest”. It is intended that such
updates and evolution will result in a reduction over the Term in the Operational Charges. In
order to implement Project Everest, Fujitsu Services requires Post Office to make certain
financial commitments with respect to the committed spend under the Agreement and Post
Office has agreed to provide such commitments, as specifically described within this Schedule
I] (Revenue Switch Mechanism).

DEFINITIONS

“Actual Spend” means the total amount of spend actually agreed and contracted for between
Post Office and Fujitsu Services under this Agreement in respect of:

211 the Operational Services (including HNG-X Test Infrastructure);

2.1.2. the Horizon Software IPR pursuant to Clause 30.19 of the Agreement;
2.1.3 the Core Team;

2.1.4 Trinity 3;

2.1.5 Invest to Save provisions as described in paragraph 17 of Schedule D1; and
2.1.6 any Additional Services (whether under this Agreement or otherwise),

during the Commitment Period. This shall include: (i) all amounts invoiced and paid under
the Agreement; (ii) all amounts invoiced and payable but not yet paid under the Agreement;
and (iii) all amounts in respect of which Fujitsu Services is entitled to invoice pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement but has not yet done so.

“Additional Services” means any combination of any of the following:

2.2.3 evolved and updated services introduced as a result of Project Everest;
2.2.4 Programme Spend; and

2.2.5 new Services (whether under this Agreement or otherwise) which Fujitsu Services
has chosen to bid for, to the extent awarded to Fujitsu Services and which are
performed during the Commitment Period, excluding any extensions or changes or
new Services directly related to the current POLSAP Services, and/or Branch
Network Services,

“Committed Development Services” means any Development Services ordered by Post
Office on the basis of a minimum pre-committed spend or capacity in accordance with the
processes and principles contained within Schedule I3 (Digital Development Services).

“Committed Spend” means committed total spend under this Agreement for:

2.4.4 Trinity 3; and

2.4.5 Invest to Save provisions as described in paragraph 17 of Schedule D1,

in each case during the Commitment Period that would have been payable by Post Office to
Fujitsu Services pursuant to this Agreement but for the implementation of Variabilisation.

“Commitment Period” means the period starting on 1 April 2017 and ending 31 March
2023.

“Pivot to Cloud” means the evolution of the Horizon system services and the underlying
infrastructure to the Fujitsu Services K5 cloud based hosting environment. For clarity, Pivot

the Belfast data centre, as is set forth within paragraph 1.2.2 (b) of Schedule E (Termination
and The Exit Plan). For the purposes of assessing Committed Spend, the committed value of
Trinity 3 shall be considered to be £7.5m in 2019/20 and £7.5m in 2020/21.

2.11 “Variabilisation” means the process by which the parties are agreeing changes to the pricing
model for the Services to a consumption-based, demand-driven, charging mechanism,
including through evolution of the application support, service management and reporting
Services to underpin the move to demand driven charges and which will affect the revised
technology and to support Post Office’s future business strategy, the framework for which is
set out in Schedule [2 (Variabilisation Framework).

3. COMMITMENT

3.1 Post Office shall procure from Fujitsu Services Additional Services that can be compliantly
awarded to Fujitsu Services such that the Actual Spend during the Commitment Period is no
less than the Committed Spend.

3.2 The Parties agree that, as at I April 2017, the Committed Spend, were the Commitment Period
to run from I April 2017 until 31 March 2023, is £195.74m and is made up of the figures set
out in Annex 3 to this Schedule I] (Revenue Switch Mechanism), it being understood that:
(a) the provisions of the Agreement that operate to vary the Charges comprising the
Committed Spend will continue to do so (including, but not limited to, indexation and
termination); and (b) in the event that the Commitment Period ends prior to the 31 March
2023, the Committed Spend will be calculated for the shorter period and will also include the
Termination Charges calculated in accordance with the Agreement. The parties will monitor
and regularly update the Committed Spend in accordance with Annex 1 to this Schedule I
(Revenue Switch Mechanism) and the final Committed Spend figure shall only be established
by the parties at the expiry of the Commitment Period.

3.3 Where a CT relates to Committed Development Services, all spend under such CT (whether
above or below any commitment therein) shall be included within Actual Spend. In addition,
where any such CT is terminated in advance of its anticipated end date (whether any relevant
commitment has been met or not), all amounts invoiced and paid under such CT shall be
included within Actual Spend.

3.4 All Programme Spend from I August 2017 onwards shall be included within Actual Spend.

For the avoidance of doubt, Actual Spend shall not include any amounts relating to any spend
agreed and contracted for between Post Office and Fujitsu Services on an ad hoc, time and
materials basis, save for where such spend forms part of Programme Spend.

On a six-monthly basis, within the appropriate commercial governance forum, the parties shall
review Actual Spend to date and the Committed Spend in accordance with Annex I to this
Schedule I] (Revenue Switch Mechanism). Notwithstanding any such review of Actual
Spend, Post Office’s success in procuring Additional Services to meet the requirements of
paragraph 3.1 shall only be finally assessed at the end of the Commitment Period.

No later than 3 months prior to the start of the final 12-month period of the Commitment
Period, Post Office and Fujitsu Services shall meet at an executive level to assess whether
Actual Spend is likely to meet Committed Spend by the end of the Committed Period and
agree any relevant actions that may be required.

In the event that at the end of the Commitment Period the Actual Spend does not exceed the
Committed Spend, the matter shall be escalated between the parties to the appropriate
governance forum involving attendees at the most senior level for both Post Office and Fujitsu
Services for consideration and agreement as to any relevant actions that may be required to
bridge the gap between the Actual Spend and Committed Spend. If following such escalation,
no resolution is agreed between the parties within 30 days from the date of such escalation,
Fujitsu Services shall have the right to invoice the Post Office for the difference between the
Committed Spend and the Actual Spend and the Post Office shall pay that invoiced amount
in accordance with the payment timescales set out within Schedule D2 (Ordering, Invoicing
and Payment).

There may be circumstances where Fujitsu Services chooses not to bid for a new service
(including, but not limited to, where the required service is predominantly for pass-through
third party goods or services). To the extent that the parties agree that it would make strategic
sense for Fujitsu Services to provide these new services the parties shall, acting reasonably,
agree the extent to which the spend on such new services shall be included within Actual
Spend. By way of example, this may involve splitting the new services into multiple CTs or
service lines to isolate the pass-through costs from spend on Fujitsu Services’ resources.

mechanisms in the Agreement, for the purposes of tracking Actual Spend at the end of the
Commitment Period against the Committed Spend.

Part B - Tracking Actual Spend and Forecast

1. For the purposes of Paragraph 3.6 of this Schedule I] (Revenue Switch Mechanism) the first
review shall take place before 31 May, 2018.

2. Each review shall:

a. agree the values to be included in the Actual Spend in terms of each of the categories
detailed in paragraph 2.2 of this Schedule I] (Revenue Switch Mechanism); and

b. escalate any unresolved items to the executive governance forum.

3. The parties shall record in the minutes of the executive governance forum the agreed Actual
Spend total for each review period.

Worked Examples
Example 1

In Year X the Committed Spend for the period is £31m including indexation adjustment for BAU and
Test Rigs, and £7.5m for Trinity projects. Through Everest the projected spend is as follows:

1. Horizon Agreement for year x has Operational Services (BAU)
a. fixed price component of £15m
b. variable price estimate of £12m
2. DDS and Core teams has
a. Fixed price of £4m
b. DDS capacity order for the year is £5m for 100 sprint resource units
3. Belfast Migration spend is forecast to be £5m
4. During the year the DDS through governance the following changes are made
a. Capacity reduced and used to 90 sprint resource units

b. POL orders 50 days call off consultancy to support as hoc requirements of which 30
days are used

c. Changes to Belfast solution which simplifies the migration and reduces spend by £1m

d. Additional resources are required from Japan for Belfast Migration and ordered on a
time and material (T&M) basis at an estimated cost of £500k.

5. Consumed resource units for the year are
a. BAU variable £12.5m
b. DDS Resource Units £ 4.5m
c. Belfast main contract £ 4.0m
d. Belfast Japan £ 0.3m
The annual review would therefore confirm the following:

6. Committed Spend for the year is

a. BAU & Test Rigs £31.0
b. Trinity projects £75

7. Actual Spend for the purposes of calculation are
a. BAU fixed £15.0
b. BAU Variable £12.5
c. DDS & Core Fixed £ 4.0
d. DDS Resource Units £ 4.5
e. Programme Spend £43

£39.5m

Notes to accompany worked example 1:

(J The Belfast Japan time and material charges are included in the Actual Spend because all of
Belfast Migration is included in the definition of Programme Spend. Accommodation and agree
travel expenses would not be included in the Actual Spend.

O Notwithstanding paragraph 3.6 of Schedule I] (Revenue Switch Mechanism), although reviewed
on a sixth monthly basis for convenience, the ultimate assessment of whether Actual Spend
exceeds the Committed Spend shall be undertaken at the end of the Commitment Period and
accordingly there is no consequence should Actual Spend fail to exceed Committed Spend in
respect of any given year.

Example 2
The scenario is as per Example I with the following additions.

1. Post Office awards a new Service to Fujitsu Services under the Agreement of an estimated
£1m per annum starting at the beginning of year x, priced 100% on a variable Resource Unit
cost of £500.

2. Post Office places multiple CTs during the year of £3m on a T&M basis.

3. Post Office places new project (Project Calculus) with Fujitsu Services at the start of the year
for £2m for a specified mix of skills. Project Calculus is outside of the definition of
Programme Spend. This is placed as follows

Schedule! Version 14.0

Page 9 of 19
FU,

CONFIDENTIAL

a. £1.5m for fixed capacity order billed on T&M basis
b. £0.5m as a capped T&M.
4. At the year end the utilisation was
a. New Service Resource Units is 1800 = £0.9m
b. Project Calculus capacity (increased through governance) £1.6m
¢. Project Calculus T&M £0.3m

5. The impact on the Actual Spend for calculation purposes is

a. Existing Actual Spend as per example 1 £39.5m
b. Service Resource Units £ 0.9m
¢. Project Calculus (capacity CT only) £ 1.6m

£42.0m

Notes to accompany worked example 2:

Project Calculus charges can only be included in the Actual Spend when it is ordered within the
definition of Committed Development Services (i.e. only those ordered under the CT for
capacity). The time and material charges are excluded in the Actual Spend because the
Development Services ordered by Post Office do not qualify as Additional Services as defined
above. In summary:

 Alltime and material resource under Programme Spend as defined in 2.6 above are
included in Actual Spend (example 1 — Belfast Japan).
(© Other time and material charges not invoiced under a capacity CT are excluded from

Actual Spend.

Schedule 12

Variabilisation Framework

1. VARIABILISATION APPROACH

Ll Variabilisation Principles

Ld

"Variabilisation” refers to the process of changing the pricing model for
the Services to a consumption-based, demand-driven charging
mechanism, including through evolution of the application support,
service management and reporting Services to underpin the move to
demand-driven charges through a revision of technology and to support
Post Office’s future business strategy.

The baseline for the purposes of assessing the success of Variabilisation
is the total 2017/18 Service Charges for the Operational Services plus
HNG-X Test Infrastructure, being £27.24m (the “Baseline”) (established
in accordance with Annex 1).

Through following the process of Variabilisation as described within this
Schedule, the parties aim to move Operational Services plus HNG-X Test
Infrastructure, the Charges for which represent, during 2017/18, at least
50% of the Baseline, to a consumption-based or demand-driven charging
mechanism (the “Variabilisation Goal’).

The parties will aim to achieve the Variabilisation Goal through an open
and transparent joint process. Variabilisation shall be completed by 31
March 2020 (“Variabilisation Completion”).

The parties will, through the relevant joint governance forums, agree a
rolling six-monthly plan, detailing the intended Variabilisation activities
to be undertaken by the parties during such period.

The achieved percentage of Variabilised Services (defined below) as
against the Variabilisation Goal shall be regularly assessed by the parties
within the relevant governance forum and ultimately upon Variabilisation
Completion. A worked example of how this achieved percentage is
calculated is included at Annex 2 of this Schedule 12 (Variabilisation
Framework).

Where any Variabilised Service is charged on the basis of consumption
but for reasons of service continuity, protection, financial reasons or

Schedule I Version 13.0

Page 13 of 19

FUJ00234786
FUJ00234786
CONFIDENTIAL

otherwise, Post Office agrees to a minimum quantity of consumed units,
the entire spend on such Variabilised Service shall be considered
“variable” for the purposes of assessing the achieved percentage of
Variabilised Services against the Variabilisation Goal.

12 Variabilisation Framework and Candidates

1.2.1

Within this Schedule, a “Resource Unit” shall refer to any unit of
consumption for an element of a Variabilised Service as may be agreed
between the parties.

Certain elements of the Services may be provided on the basis of specific
activities and responsibilities which are Variabilised such that the
consumption of such elements by Post Office is measured on a Resource
Unit basis. The provision of such Variabilised Services shall be
undertaken on the basis of this Schedule I2 (the "Variabilisation
Framework"). Together, those elements of the Services delivered on a
Variabilised bi
"Variabilised Services".

is under this Variabilisation Framework shall be the

As part of Variabilisation, the parties shall jointly identify candidate
elements of the Services to be delivered as a Variabi

d Service (each
being a "Variabilisation Candidate"). Each Variabilisation Candidate
shall be described in writing, with such written proposal to include:

1.2.3.1 a summary of the Variabilisation Candidate;

1.2.3.2 details of the specific Services that are within the scope of
such Variabilisation Candidate (including describing in
appropriate detail the changes proposed to the existing
Services);

1.2.3.3 any transition or implementation activities that may be
required to deliver the Variabilised Service (including any
proposed charges relating to the same);

1.2.3.4 details of the underlying Resource Unit by which the
Variabilisation Candidate shall be charged to Post Office
(with such Resource Unit meeting the characteristics set out
within paragraph 1.3 below); and

1.2.3.5 a pricing proposal for the underlying Resource Unit for the
Variabilisation Candidate.

Each party shall provide the other with reasonable support and assistance
as may be required to establish and document each Variabilisation

Schedule I Version 14.0

Page 14 of 19

FUJ00234786
FUJ00234786
CONFIDENTIAL

Candidate. This may include appropriate workshops and other assistance
with discovery and establishment of appropriate Resource Units.

1.2.5 Where the parties agree a Variabilisation Candidate, the Parties shall
document in writing such Variabilisation Candidate through the execution
of a CCN (each a “Variabilisation CCN”). For the avoidance of doubt:

1.2.5.1

1.2.5.2

each Variabilisation CCN shall include: (i) all relevant
changes to the Services; (ii) all relevant changes to the
provisions of this Agreement relating to the Charges for the
Services to include the agreed charge per Resource Unit and
other associated Resource Unit details relating to the
Variabilisation Candidate; and (iii) any other required
changes to the Agreement; and

where a Variabilisation Candidate requires transition or
implementation activities in order to deliver the Variabilised
Services, the parties will execute an appropriate CT where
necessary.

1.2.6 The parties acknowledge that:

1.2.6.1

1.2.6.2

1.2.6.3

standard commodity-based services provided by Fujitsu
Services may meet the requirements of Variabilisation using
the standard pricing mechanisms for such services;

not all elements of the Services or components of the pricing
mechanism may be suitable to move to a demand-driven
model; and

protection and surety of the Horizon system may require a
form of minimum consumption commitment from Post
Office to enable Fujitsu Services to meet the service levels
and obligations in this Agreement, both current and as may
be varied. Notwithstanding this, such minimum commitment
should be with reference to a minimum number of Resource
Units, rather than minimum spend.

13 Resource Unit Characteristics

All Resource Units will have the following characteristics:

1.3.1 consumable on a variable basis by Post Office based on actual demand;

1.3.2 sufficiently granular so as to be truly flexible such that the number of
resource units consumed changes meaningfully with an increase or

decrease in consumption (for example, if Post Office requires an activity

Page 15 of 19

to be performed by Fujitsu Services 100 times, a Resource Unit for the
single activity, with the task charged as 100 Resource Units, would meet
this requirement, whereas a Resource Unit for the activity to be performed
100 times, with the task charged as 1 Resource Unit, would not);

capable of tangible, individual and objective measurement;

wherever possible, aligned with an industry-standard definition of the
applicable Resource Unit;

individually priced with a clear and objective adjustment mechanism for
changes in consumption; and

accompanied by clear, agreed factors which qualify an activity as meeting
any size qualification which may apply to the Resource Unit (for example,
the factors that establish the Resource Unit as being "small" or "large" or
“simple” or “complex”).

1. Data Centre Operations and Central Networks - calculated on a like for like basis within
the Pivot to Cloud project

a. Fixed price element £4.0m
b. Minimum Resource Unit value £2.0m
c. Like for like other variable Resource Units £1.5m

d. Total £7.5m

2. Third and Fourth line support (excluding any impact of creating of OpEx to Capex)

a. Fixed price element £3.5m.

b. Minimum Resource Unit value £2.0m
c. Like for Like variable Resource Units £2.8m
d. Total £8.3m

3. Service & Security Management (£6.5m)

a. Fixed price element £3.0m
b. Like for like variable Resource Units £2.8m
c. Total £5.8m

4. Test Rigs

a. Fixed Price Element £0.5m
b. Minimum Resource Units £1.8m
c. Total £2.3m

5. Summing the above totals, the total cost of like for like Operational Services and HNG-
X Test Infrastructure post-Variabilisation is therefore £23.9m

Calculation of achieved Variabilisation percentage is as follows:

Schedule I Version 14.0

6. Minimum Resource Units and variable Resource Units

a. Data Centre Ops and Central Networks £3.5m
b. Third and Fourth Line Support £4.8m
c. Service & Security Management £2.8m
d. Test Rigs £1.8m
e. Total charges from variable Resource Units £12.9m

7. Variabilisation Achieved
a. £12.9m of the total £23.9m is charged on a variable basis

b. The Variabilisation achieved is therefore 12.9 / 23.9 = 54%.

Note to accompany the Worked Examples:

The approach adopted above is to base the calculation on a like for like service obligations.
Thus in the example the numbers reflect a hypothetical saving as a result of the revised
operating model and new technology. This equates to baseline number pre-variabilisation
of £3.34m.

For the purposes of this illustrative example a hypothetical split of Operational Charges has
been used.

APPLICATION SUPPORT AND MAINTENANCE
Schedule 12.1
Service Description

The parties shall review the contents of CCDs SVM/SDM/SD/0004 and SVM/SDM/SD/0005
(and the relevant provisions relating to the Reference Data Management Service described
within SVM/SDM/SD/0013) and agree a revised Service Description for Application Support
and Maintenance services. The parties shall seek to agree such revised service description
and document the same via a CCN no later than 14 August 2018 (“Revised ASM Service’).

The following provisions shall apply from 1 July 2018 up to 31% March 2023.

1. Interim ASM Service Model
In the interim period and until such subsequent CCN is agreed, the parties agree that
Fujitsu Services shall deliver the Applications Support and Maintenance (ASM)
Service in accordance with the Service Descriptions SVM/SDM/SD/0004 and
SVM/SDM/SD/0005 (and the relevant provisions relating to the Reference Data
Management Service described within SVM/SDM/SD/0013) in respect of which the
resources provided as part of ASM undertake this work (the charges for which are
set out in Annex B (Operational Charges Table, under the Reference Data
Management Service row) to Schedule D1 (Charges)) (“Existing CCDs”), but with the
following changes applied as set out within the remaining provisions of this Schedule
12.

1.1 Post Office and Fujitsu Services will create a mandatory Business Impact Forum
(‘BIF”) as a weekly meeting which will have as its agenda and the Terms of Reference
the items set out in Appendix A to this Schedule.

1.2 The parties shall review the contents of Appendix A and shall agree any required
updates together with amended meeting attendees and terms of reference for the BIF.
Until such time as the formal BIF meeting is superseded by a CCN, these provisions
shall continue to apply.

1.3 Fujitsu Services will receive all Incidents with respect to Business Capabilities and
Support Facilities and associated POL Service Types (regardless of Severity Level)
from the Post Office third party service integrator.

1.4 Where a Problem exists as a result of an Incident, all Severity 1 and 2 Problems will
be managed in accordance with the Existing CCDs but with respect to Problems
relating to Severity 3 or 4 Fujitsu Services shall notify the Post Office and gain its
consent to fix the Problem. Post Office shall provide its consent or rejection to such
fix within [2] business days following a BIF meeting. The Demand Planning Forum will
then prioritise the fix and schedule a suitable timeframe for the fix.

1.5 Notwithstanding paragraph 1.4, where Fujitsu Services reasonably determines that a
Severity level has been wrongly allocated (for example a Severity 3 should have been

a Severity 1 or Severity 2), Fujitsu Services shall be entitled to fix that Problem and
Fujitsu Services shall inform Post Office of this fact at the next BIF.

1.6 Fujitsu Services will seek to identify trends in Incidents calls which have been caused
as a result of a known Problem. In the event that, despite the Post Office having
previously requested that the Problem is not to be fixed, Fujitsu Services has identified
that the Problem has caused one or more further Incidents to be raised, which causes
Fujitsu Services to incur costs or otherwise negates the business case for the previous
decision not to fix the same, Fujitsu Services shall be entitled to escalate the matter to
the Service Director or the Group CIO to gain approval to complete the fix.

1.7 All Incidents shall be managed in accordance with the ASM Service. Where the ASM
Service identifies that the Problem associated with an Incident relates to a Product as
defined in Schedule 13 (Digital Development Services) then the resolution of the
Problem shall be passed to the DDS Standing Platform Team as a resolver group. For
the avoidance of doubt whilst the ASM Service shall be responsible for management
of the Incident and associated Problem the responsibilities for resolution remains
within the DDS Standing Platform Team.

Fujitsu Services and Post Office will work collaboratively together to minimise any
impacts to the delivery of the service. These include assessing the Post Office
Responsibilities set out in Appendix B. Where there is a material impact to the service a
service improvement / initiative will be incepted, and the matter shall be escalated to the
Service Director or the Group CIO. The contents of Appendix B shall be reviewed
annually and updated accordingly.

Business Impact Forum
Objectives

The purpose of the forum is to:

Decide upon the severity/business impact and priority of Problems (and decide whether a fix is
to be made).

Assess the cost to fix Problems being development costs, test costs release and
implementation costs.

Assess the impact of deployment considering how soon does it need to be deployed and
whether it needs to be prioritised.

Assess the overall impact to the release (i.e., timeframes, cost, quality) that will be assigned to
deliver the fix of the Problem as part of the scope of its deliverables.

Assess the risk to the success and business objectives of the release that will deliver the fix to
the live environment.

Assess whether a workaround, if acceptable i.e. not compromising the integrity, availability and
security of Horizon, is a more cost effective solution than the actual fix.

Liaise with the Demand Planning Forum to schedule any approved fixes.

Terms of Reference

The Business Impact Forum (BIF) convenes primarily to agree whether a Problem must be
fixed or a workaround can be a feasible solution.

Problems routed to BIF or Demand Planning Forum needs an action placed on it.

The BIF is a joint Governance forum comprising representatives from Post Office and Fujitsu
Services. The frequency of BIF is weekly.

An agenda including the list of Problems to be discussed will be sent with a calendar invite
before the set meeting date.

Minutes capturing BIF decision and actions will be distributed after the meeting.

manner (relevant to the associated severity of the Incident) when requested and
determined by Fujitsu Services as reasonably necessary, to facilitate the Incident
resolution;

provide sufficiently skilled resources who can attend the BIF and who are empowered
to make decisions as to whether such Incidents or Problems should be resolved;

respond to Fujitsu Services’ requests for additional information on unresolved
Incidents within 2 business days of request, otherwise the Incident will be returned to
the Post Office third party service integrator and any Incident Management SLTs shall
not apply until such time as the information has been provided;

agree to formally document in a Known Error Log (KEL), where Post Office has
decided not to proceed with a fix for any Incident or Problem and to share such
document with the Post Office third party service integrator to ensure that it does not
raise any further Incidents relating to the same issue to Fujitsu Services;

to ensure any third party products in respect of which Post Office owns the licence
(and any related support agreements) and which are used by Fujitsu Services to
deliver the ASM Service, remain in place;

. ensure that commentary and evidential data relating to Incidents can be automatically

transferred between the Post Office third party service integrator and Fujitsu Services’
ASM Incident management systems via the current Incident Management tool used by

service integrator systems within a reasonable timescale depending upon the Severity
of the Problem following receipt by the Post Office third party service integrator;

. ensure that the ownership and management of all Incidents remains with the Post

Office third party service integrator. The Post Office third party service integrator will
own the interface with Users and be responsible for all communication with that User;

. manage all Post Office third party application providers to which the ASM Service

interfaces, obliging such third parties to respond to Fujitsu Services in a timely manner
(relevant to the associated severity of the Incident) where Fujitsu Services reasonably
considers that an Incident is related to that third party application interface, otherwise
the Incident will be returned to the Post Office third party service integrator and any
Incident Management SLTs shall not apply until such time as the information has been
provided;

. permit all ASM resources to access both application code, configuration details and

application data sets as strictly necessary to provide the ASM Services by agreeing
which ASM resources will be permitted under the PCI security controls;

. maintain the Service Management Service, Management Information Service, Security

Management Service and the ongoing provision of the HNG-X Test Infrastructure (until
a new cloud platform is available), as this ASM Service depends on such Services and
Infrastructure being in place; and

. provision of a representative test system which simulates the live Operational Service

available to the Incident Service (described above) to allow the reproduction of
Incidents (that can be replicated) and the testing of workarounds.

OPTIMISING DEVELOPMENT CAPACITY RESOURCE

Fujitsu Services will make available up to £3,000,000 per annum up until 31°t March
2023 (as amended through the allocation of the Invest to Save Credit) of Application
Support (Fourth Line) resource capacity (‘Development Capacity Resource”) which
can be utilised to deliver capital value projects (each a “Capital Project”) as well as
the additional resources outlined in the table below (together the “ASM Support
Package”):

Activity Capped Amount per
month
Development Capacity Resource £160,000
Architecture £50,000
Project Management £20,000
SV&lI Testers £20,000

The figures outlined above shall be the maximum monthly amount Post Office can
benefit from under the ASM Support Package by resource type; any overspend in
any month for any resource type shall be charged on a time and materials basis for
that billing period using the Rate Card. Fujitsu Services will advise Post Office
promptly in writing when they have reached 80% of this total capped monthly
allowance by resource type. The additional resources in the ASM Support Package
(Architecture, Project Management and SV&l Testers) cannot be utilised to deliver
Capital Projects outside of changes to the Horizon application. The ASM Support
Package shall not be used to deliver anything under the Digital Development
Services.

The parties shall cooperate to optimise the use of the Development Capacity
Resource capacity and such use shall be through

3.2.1. The Parties identifying, and Fujitsu Services managing and delivering a
Capital Project which requires no additional resources other than the
Development Capacity Resource and the additional resources identified
under the ASM Support Package and the available resource capacity has
the requisite skills and experience available for the specific requirements of
the Capital Project at the time of request; or

3.2.2 The process described in paragraph 3.8 below

Spare capacity and any of the ASM Support Package not used in a particular month
will not be carried over from a previous month.

requirement in accordance with the CWO process currently in place in order to
determine the required resource profile and availability of appropriately skilled
resources to be allocated to the project, taking into account current Service Incidents
and Problems and resource requirements for existing Capital Projects.

The Change Work Order for the requested Capital Project will include the estimated
number of days which are intended to be delivered by the ASM Support Package,
and which additional resources will need to be funded (if any). For CWOs where no
additional resources outside of the Development Capacity Resource are required, the
value of the CWO will be shown as Zero. For CWOs where some additional resource
is needed, the CWO will provide an approximate, estimated split (expressed as a
resource break down) between the resources to be provided from the Development
Capacity Resource and other resources for the purposes of calculating an
estimate. Fujitsu Services will not however subsequently invoice for the resources
that makes up the ASM Support Package unless the maximum caps detailed in
Paragraph 3.1 are achieved.

A monthly report will be provided detailing the number of days of resource used under
the ASM Support Package per grade that has been consumed by agreed fixes,
CWOs or otherwise by Capital Projects to date. This monthly breakdown of effort
used on each CWO within each pot under the ASM Support Package will be provided
in order for Post Office to cross charge to the relevant projects.

Post Office will raise a purchase order for the full CWO value irrespective of any split
between the ASM pot and T&M except in relation to any Development Capacity
resource estimates.

The parties will attend weekly meetings to review the forward forecast, with the aim
of maintaining a view of the next quarter's demand. Any impediments to mutual
progress and the priority level of activities will be raised in this meeting. The Parties
may agree, where the forecast does not provide sufficient Capital Projects to meet
the ASM Support Package capped amounts provided in Paragraph 3.1 above, to use
the Development Capacity Resource to undertake additional agreed activities where
no other resources are required, either in the absence of, or prior to, signature of a
CWO. This resource shall be tracked by a spreadsheet managed by Fujitsu Services.

Fujitsu Services will provide a rolling forecast of the following 12 months for all Capital
Projects that are in progress, reflecting the expected resource profile for all agreed
and signed CWOs. The forecast of unsigned CWOs will be evenly spread over the
estimated period of delivery.

Fujitsu Services shall track and report on utilisation of the ASM Support Package.
The cost of undertaking this activity shall be deducted from the Project Management
capped amount per month detailed in paragraph 3.1. The Project Management
capped amount shall therefore be reduced by £3,360 per month.

SPRINT TEAM STRUCTURE

The following shall be the standard structure for a Sprint Team (“Standard Sprint
Team Structure”):

6.1.1 1 ScrumMaster;

6.1.2 4 Developers;

6.1.3. 1 Tech Lead;

6.1.4 2 Test Analysts; and

6.1.5 1 Business Analyst,

each of which shall have the responsibilities set out within Appendix 3 (Participants).

The parties acknowledge and agree the benefit of standardisation and consistency in
the structure and delivery of the Digital Development Services. However, during the
Product Initiation phase or at any other time agreed by the Digital Demand
Forecasting Board (on at least 90 days’ prior notice), if, despite having acted
reasonably to seek to use the Standard Sprint Team Structure and standard size of
Sprint Team, Post Office and Fujitsu Services are unable to make use of such
Standard Sprint Team Structure, Post Office and Fujitsu Services may agree (or, in
exceptional circumstances only, where the Standard Sprint Team Structure and
standard size of Sprint Team cannot accommodate the Sprints intended for a Sprint
Team, Post Office may require):

6.2.1. an alternative structure for a Sprint Team for a given Product that differs from
the Standard Sprint Team Structure in which case the parties will agree upon
the allocated roles to be contained within that alternative or smaller Sprint
Team and consider any applicable necessary changes to the Per Sprint
Story Point Allocation accordingly, taking into consideration the composition
of the Sprint Team and increased (for example, due to improved
communication as a result of a smaller team) or decreased (for example, a
larger percentage of a smaller team providing management, rather than
development, functions) efficiencies introduced through the size of Sprint
Team;

6.2.2 an alternative, smaller size for a Sprint Team, in which case the parties will
agree upon the allocated roles to be contained within that alternative or
smaller Sprint Team and consider any applicable necessary changes to the
Per Sprint Story Point Allocation accordingly; or

6.2.3 to fill a Fujitsu Services appointed role in the given Sprint Team with a Post
Office individual (provided that the ScrumMaster and Tech Lead shall always
be filled by Fujitsu Services).

For clarity, the day to day management of the Sprint Team resides with Fujitsu
Services and Post Office shall ensure that any of the Sprint Participants who are Post
Office roles agree to accept management and direction by Fujitsu Services.

For each Sprint, Fujitsu Services shall ensure that the Fujitsu Services appointed
roles in the Standard Sprint Team Structure are filled by effectively trained individuals

with the abilities, qualifications and experience necessary to meet the Sprint
Requirements. The parties acknowledge the continuity benefit of retaining the same
individuals in the appointed roles and therefore any changes will need to be managed
to minimise Sprint disruption. In particular, Fujitsu Services shall not change any
individual in the Fujitsu Services appointed roles without a valid, justifiable reason for
doing so, which it shall provide to Post Office in advance of the individual being
changed. Where the Sprint Requirements for a Sprint require particular skillsets,
Fujitsu Services may, in consultation with the Product Owner, vary the individuals in
the Fujitsu Services appointed roles for that Sprint in order to match such skillsets.

DEMAND FORECASTING
The Digital Demand Forecasting Board

Post Office shall be responsible for arranging and managing the Digital Demand
Forecasting Board which shall meet every 12 weeks during the DDS Term, and as
otherwise required. The Digital Demand Forecasting Board shall work with the Post
Office’s portfolio management processes to understand, assess and manage the
overall Demand Forecast. Should the Digital Demand Forecasting Board fail to meet
as scheduled, Fujitsu Services shall escalate the same to Post Office’s Group ClO
as a priority and the Digital Demand Forecasting Board shall urgently meet within 5
business days of such escalation.

The Digital Demand Forecasting Board shall be responsible for:

7.2.1 reviewing and registering new Products on the Demand Forecast by
assessing whether there is available capacity for these within the current
resources involved in the provision of DDS (as set out in Appendix 3);

7.2.2 agreeing the Sprint Team requirements and associated increase or
decrease in other resources as appropriate on a 90 day ordering block as
more fully described in Appendix 5;

7.2.3 shifting available capacity from one Product to another Product as forecast
demand flexes (including where Post Office requires urgent works on a
Product or otherwise wishes to prioritise or expedite a Product); and

7.2.4 allocating Sprint Teams to Product Owners and Product Delivery Managers/

The commercial mechanisms for ordering additional capacity or reducing a previous
commitment are set out in Appendix 5 to this Schedule 13.

The provisional attendees to the Digital Demand Forecasting Board are set out in
Appendix 4 (Governance).

PRODUCT INITIATION

Once the Product Vision and Business Case have been produced by the relevant
Product Sponsor and approved internally by Post Office, then where Post Office
requires Fujitsu Services to commence the delivery of the relevant Product it shall
commence Product Initiation. Product Initiation utilises the Product Vision and

Business Case to deliver the pre-requisites and dependencies that are necessary
before development work can commence.

As part of Product Initiation, Fujitsu Services, with Post Office input, shall produce the
following key deliverables:

8.2.1 a Product Overview Document, which will contain the following components,
some of which will have been prepared by Post Office:

(a) a detailed Product Vision which has been prepared by the Product
Owner;
(b) an overview of the architectural approach, including an agreement

as to any elements of the Product which are Listed Rights (if known
at this stage);

(c) a Release and Test Strategy for the Product which itself has been
prepared by the Post Office; and

(d) the Service Requirements for supporting the Product once live; and
8.2.2 an initial Product Backlog.

In order to support Post Office to complete the Product Roadmap for the Product,
Fujitsu Services will perform the following activities:

8.3.1 provide support and expertise to the Product Owner to enable effective
planning;

8.3.2 analyse User Stories to provide advice on dependencies and pre-requisites
so that User Stories in the Product Backlog can be correctly prioritised and
sequenced;

8.3.3 provide advice on the size and complexity of each User Story to enable items
in the Product Backlog to be scheduled into available Sprints;

8.3.4 provide input to enable Product Backlog items to be identified as Planned
User Stories and/or Stretch User Stories; and

8.3.5 feed into the Digital Demand Forecasting board as necessary.

AGILE METHODOLOGY

Each party shall act in accordance with the provisions of Appendix 1 (Agile
Methodology).

PERFORMANCE METRICS

The parties shall comply with the terms of Appendix 4 (Governance) and Appendix 8
(Service Credit Mechanism).

RELIEF EVENTS AND DISRUPTED SPRINTS

To the extent that Fujitsu Services becomes aware that it may be unable to complete
a Sprint Requirement as the result of the occurrence of a Relief Event, Fujitsu shall:

Schedule I3 Version 14.0
Page 10 of 50
FUJ00234786
FUJ00234786

CONFIDENTIAL

11.1.1 notify Post Office as soon as reasonably possible and at the next Daily
Stand-up; and

11.1.2 use its reasonable endeavours to mitigate the Relief Event (which may
include working on alternative User Stories within the Sprint Backlog).

11.2 Where Fujitsu Services is not able to sufficiently mitigate the Relief Event, the
affected Sprint Requirement(s) shall be removed from the relevant Sprint and the
matter shall be escalated to the ScrumMaster and Product Owner, who shall refer the
matter (with their recommendations) to the Delivery Lead and Product Delivery
Manager for resolution. The parties will agree the impact of the Relief Event on the
affected Sprint Requirement(s) upon the Sprint (including with regard to Appendix 8
(Service Credit Mechanism)).

11.3 Fujitsu Services shall not be liable for failing to complete a Sprint Requirement that
has been removed from a Sprint pursuant to paragraph 11.2, but shall still be required
to seek to complete the remainder of the Sprint Requirements in the relevant Sprint.

11.4 Where the Product Owner elects in respect of any given Sprint to cease such Sprint
or to make a material change to a Sprint prior to scheduled completion, and such
Sprint is thus ceased prior to scheduled completion, such Sprint shall be considered
a “Disrupted Sprint’.

11.5 Where a Priority 1 or Priority 2 incident occurs in respect of a given Product (as
determined by Post Office) and such incident is identified through the existing incident
management procedures as being within the remit of the Digital Development Service
as a resolver group, then (unless otherwise specified by Post Office), one or more of
the Sprint Teams for such Product (as directed by the DDS Lead) shall immediately
prioritise resolving such incident, irrespective of the current Sprint Backlog. The
occurrence of such Priority 1 or Priority 2 incident shall be considered a Relief Event
for the impacted Sprints.

12. CHARGES

12.1 In consideration for the provision of the Digital Development Services, Post Office
shall pay to Fujitsu Services the Charges set out in Appendix 5 (DDS Charges) (the
“DDS Charges’).

APPENDIX 1
AGILE METHODOLOGY
1. GENERAL
1.1 The Participants shall adopt an agile development methodology based upon the

“Scrum Framework’ for the Products in the Product Roadmap and development work
shall be carried out during a series of Sprints and in accordance with the processes
set out within this Appendix 1 (Agile Methodology).

1.2 Each Sprint shall have a fixed period of two (2) weeks, during which a Sprint Team
shall complete and test Sprint Functionality in respect of all Sprint Requirements in
the Sprint Backlog. On the completion of a Sprint, the Sprint Team shall promptly
commence the next Sprint for which a Sprint Backlog has been prepared in
accordance with paragraphs 1.17 of this Appendix 1 (Agile Methodology).

1.3 The Participants shall use the DDS Tools in the provision of the DDS.

1.4 The total number of Story Points for the User Stories allocated to each Sprint shall
equal the Per Sprint Story Point Allocation for all Standard Sprint Teams. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Sprint Backlog for each Sprint will include additional User
Stories in excess of the Per Sprint Story Point Allocation, which may be used by the
Sprint Team in place of those User Stories due to be completed during such Sprint
where required to enable Fujitsu Services to manage the throughput and achieve the
Per Sprint Story Point Allocation. An example of when this might occur is an
unexpected inability to complete a given User Story during such Sprint.

1.5 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement the parties acknowledge that
the goal of each Sprint is to complete Sprint Functionality to fulfil all Sprint
Requirements within the applicable Sprint Backlog; however, by nature of the agile
approach used in the delivery of the Digital Development Services, it may be the case
that, despite the Sprint Team having completed sufficient Story Points so as to meet
the Per Sprint Story Point Allocation for the applicable Sprint, not all such Sprint
Functionality is completed within such Sprint. Accordingly, for the purposes of the
Service Levels, Fujitsu Services’ performance under this DDS Schedule shall be
assessed against the number of Story Points actually completed and delivered within
each Sprint, rather than the number of Sprint Requirements fulfilled. For the
avoidance of doubt, where the estimated Story Points for a Sprint Requirement
changes during the course of a Sprint then, where agreed between the parties, the
actual Story Point allocation for that Sprint Requirement will be considered for the
purposes of assessing Fujitsu Services pursuant to Appendix 8 (Service Credit
Mechanism).

1.6 Sprints may be run in parallel, where conducted by separate Sprint Teams.
Product Backlog

1.7 A product backlog shall be prepared for each Product by the relevant Product Owner,
using the Product Backlog tool and in consultation with the Product Delivery Manager,
and shall include the following items:

1.7.1. aprioritised set of development requirements (which may include bug fixes,
minor enhancements, new feature requests, non-functional requirements,
service requirements and major functionality changes) to be completed,
expressed as User Stories;

1.7.2 the estimated business value of each User Story;

1.7.3 anestimate of the number of Story Points for each User Story, allocated with
reference to the Reference User Stories;

1.7.4 aset of Acceptance Criteria for each User Story and any further details of
these User Stories provided by the Product Owner; and

1.7.5 a Definition of Done for all User Stories,
(the “Product Backlog’).

The Product Owner may add User Stories to the relevant Product Backlog at any time
and, when any such User Story is added, the Product Delivery Manager shall, in
consultation with the Product Owner, set the number of Story Points using the
Estimating Methodology and with reference to the Reference User Stories and the
Acceptance Criteria.

A Product shall be complete once all User Stories in the Product Backlog have been
delivered and the Product Owner has notified Fujitsu Services accordingly.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Product Owner may opt to end the delivery of the
Product at any point prior to the completion of all User Stories.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Product Backlog may include third line support
activities arising as a result of incidents and problems raised by Post Office and
triaged for resolution to the Digital Development Service through the existing incident
management procedures.

User Stories and the Definition of Ready

Before User Stories from the relevant Product Backlog can be included in a Sprint,
they shall meet the following requirements:

1.11.1 User Stories should be written in this format “As a <kind of user> I want
<feature> so that <benefit>” and satisfy the criteria of the INVEST matrix;

1.11.2 User Stories shall each include all appropriate investment criteria and
Acceptance Criteria both of which are written in a way that can be
understood by the Sprint Team;

1.11.3 User Stories shall be written in a way that can be understood by the Sprint
Team, especially the developers and testers;

1.11.4 User Stories shall include both functional and non-functional requirements;
1.11.5 User Stories shall have an associated level of priority;

1.11.6 User Stories shall have unique identifiers to maintain traceability and to ease
the mapping of User Stories where User Stories are related;

Schedule 13 Appendix 1 Version 14.0

1.11.7 User Stories have been sized and allocated a number of Story Points using
the Estimating Methodology by the Sprint Team (and confirmed by the
Product Delivery Manager) and utilising the Reference User Stories; and

1.11.8 the Sprint Team understands how the User Story will be tested and
demonstrated,

(together the “Definition of Ready’).

The Sprint Team, working with the Product Delivery Manager and the Product Owner,
shall be entitled to reject any User Stories that do not meet the Definition of Ready at
least 10 business days prior to the proposed Sprint. Where a User Story is rejected
pursuant to this paragraph 1.12 of Appendix 1 (Agile Methodology), the Product
Delivery Manager and the Product Owner may agree to return the User Story to the
Product Backlog to be rewritten and included in a later Sprint.

Sprint Planning Meeting

The Participants shall hold a sprint planning meeting at least 5 business days before
each Sprint commences (the “Sprint Planning Meeting’). At the Sprint Planning
Meeting:

1.13.1 the Product Owner shall identify which User Stories from the relevant
Product Backlog he/she wishes to be included in the backlog for such Sprint
(the “Sprint Backlog”);

1.13.2 the Sprint Team, working with the Product Delivery Manager and the Product
Owner, shall agree the nature of any accompanying documentation required
for each User Story within the Sprint Backlog;

1.13.3 the Sprint Team, working with the Product Delivery Manager and the Product
Owner, shall review and confirm and/or refine the estimated number of Story
Points for each User Story within the Sprint Backlog;

1.13.4 the Sprint Team, working with the Product Delivery Manager and the Product
Owner, shall review and confirm and/or refine the Acceptance Criteria for
each User Story within the Sprint Backlog, specify the Acceptance Tests and
review and confirm and/or refine the Definition of Done that will apply to
every User Story within the Sprint Backlog. As a minimum, the Definition of
Done shall include the criteria set out in Appendix 2 (Definition of Done);

1.13.5 based on the output of the processes in paragraphs 1.13.3 and 1.13.4 of this
Appendix 1 (Agile Methodology), the Sprint Team, working with the Product
Delivery Manager and the Product Owner, shall determine how many of
such User Stories can be completed during such Sprint, provided that the
sum of the Story Points for the User Stories shall equal the Per Sprint Story
Point Allocation;

1.13.6 the Sprint Team, working with the Product Delivery Manager and the Product
Owner, may decide to replace a higher priority User Story with a lower
priority User Story bearing equal or fewer Story Points if it is technically
expedient to do so; and

CONFIDENTIAL

1.13.7 the Product Delivery Manager and the Product Owner shall agree the final
selection of User Stories to be included in the Sprint Backlog (each, a “Sprint
Requirement’).

1.14 At the Sprint planning meeting, the Product Delivery Manager and the Product Owner
will also identify and agree the specific Sprint Dependencies on Post Office that are
required for the Sprint Team to be able to complete the Sprint Requirements.

1.15 At the Sprint Planning Meeting, the Product Delivery Manager and the Product Owner
will also review and confirm and/or refine which (if any) elements of the Sprint
Functionality will be Listed Rights in accordance with Paragraph 7 of Schedule H
(Digital Intellectual Property Provisions).

1.16 Once the Sprint Requirements for a Sprint have been agreed, no alterations or
additions to the Sprint Requirements (including the estimated number of Story Points,
Definition of Done and Acceptance Criteria) shall be made.

Sprint Backlog

1.17 The Product Delivery Manager shall then prepare the Sprint Backlog in consultation
with the Product Owner, which shall include:

1.17.1 the agreed Sprint Requirements;
1.17.2 the agreed number of Story Points allocated to each Sprint Requirement;

1.17.3 a breakdown of each Sprint Requirement into specific tasks and allocation
to individuals within the Sprint Team;

1.17.4 the Acceptance Criteria for each Sprint Requirement and the Definition of
Done for every Sprint Requirement; and

1.17.5 the agreed Sprint Dependencies.

1.18 The Sprint Backlog shall be completed no later than 10 business days prior to the
start of the applicable Sprint and, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, will contain
at least 120 Story Points worth of User Stories.

Sprints

1.19 During each Sprint, the Sprint Team shall develop the functionality to meet each
Sprint Requirement in accordance with the Sprint Backlog, any agreed coding
standards and this Schedule 13 (Digital Development Services) (the “Sprint
Functionality’).

1.20 By the end of each business day during the course of each Sprint, the Sprint Team
shall ensure that all functionality and other materials developed during the course of
such business day are made available (in their current state of development) in
Source Code form on an agreed code repository, for review by Post Office. The
Sprint Team shall consider, and where appropriate implement, any feedback from
such review during the course of the Sprint provided that any change to a User Story
during the Sprint may only proceed with the express consent of both the Product
Delivery Manager and Product Owner.

During each Sprint, the Sprint Team shall maintain the Sprint Backlog and update it
daily to reflect progress towards completion of the Sprint Requirements.

If, during the course of any Sprint, a dispute between the Parties arises in connection
with any Sprint Requirement which cannot be resolved within the Sprint Team, then
such Sprint Requirement shall be immediately removed from the scope of such Sprint
and the Sprint Team will seek to deliver an alternative User Story from the Sprint
Backlog to make up the Per Sprint Story Point Allocation. Where there is no
alternative User Story that is reasonably suitable to be delivered during the Sprint in
place of such Sprint Requirement, then for the purposes of assessing performance
under Appendix 8 (Service Credit Mechanism), the Per Sprint Story Point Allocation
for that Sprint shall be reduced by the number of Story Points allocated to the
removed Sprint Requirement and all Story Points expended on such Sprint
Requirement during the Sprint shall be excluded from any Service Level calculation.

Sprint Review Meetings

Within 5 business days of the last day of each Sprint, the Product Delivery Manager,
the Product Owner and the Sprint Team shall hold a review meeting in respect of
such Sprint (a “Sprint Review Meeting”). At the Sprint Review Meeting, the
Participants shall:

1.23.1 determine whether the Sprint Functionality meets the Acceptance Criteria
for each Sprint Requirement, and the Definition of Done for all Sprint
Requirements, in the Sprint;

1.23.2 agree the manner in which any ongoing support for the Sprint Functionality
will be handled; and

1.23.3 review the Agreed Metrics for the Sprint and, where appropriate, propose
additional measures to be added to the Agreed Metrics for consideration by
the DDS Service Review.

Any Sprint Requirement the Sprint Functionality for which has: (i) not met its
Acceptance Criteria; (ii) not met the relevant Definition of Done; or (iii) not been
developed during the relevant Sprint, shall not be submitted to Post Office for
Acceptance.

Any Sprint Requirement the Sprint Functionality for which has: (i) met its Acceptance
Criteria; and (ii) met the relevant Definition of Done, shall be submitted to Post Office,
in both source and object code form for Acceptance. Within 2 business days of such
submission, the Product Owner shall sign such report to indicate agreement as to
that Sprint Functionality that has been Accepted. Where the Product Owner has not
signed the acceptance report or demonstrated why any Sprint Functionality has not
met the Definition of Done and the Acceptance Criteria in accordance with the above
timescales, Fujitsu Services shall escalate the matter to the Post Office Delivery Lead
who shall use all reasonable endeavours to provide a signed form of acceptance, or
provide reasonable evidence of why any Sprint Functionality has not been Accepted,
within 24 hours of the escalation.

COMMITMENT

Subject to Fujitsu Services complying with the terms of this Schedule, the Post Office
hereby commits that the DDS Charges paid or payable in respect of each of the first
two fiscal years commencing 1 April 2018 (each such fiscal year being a “DDS
Commitment Year’) will equal or exceed £7,358,400 per annun, in the third fiscal
year, commencing 1* April 2020 it will equal or exceed £2,456,384, and in the
subsequent two fiscal years commencing 1st April 2021 and 1st April 2022 (which
shall also be deemed to be DDS Commitment Years) will equal or exceed £962,420
per annum (the “DDS Commitment’). Fujitsu Services agrees that any amount which
has been spent to date on Development Services between the 1 April 2018 and the
DDS Commencement Date will contribute towards the commitment for the first DDS
Commitment Year. The DDS Oversight Roles Service Charge and the DDS Platform
Standing Team Service Charge are excluded from the DDS Commitment for the two
latter DDS Commitment Years (those commencing on 1% April 2021 and 1% April
2022). The parties agree that the DDS Oversight Roles Service Charge and the DDS
Platform Standing Team Service Charge (regardless of the activities assigned to the
personnel to whom the DDS Oversight Roles Service Charge and the DDS Platform
Standing Team Service Charge relate) shall constitute Actual Spend for the purposes
of the calculation in Schedule 11 (Revenue Switch Mechanism).

Where Post Office in either the first or second DDS Commitment Years only fails to
meet the commitment set forth within paragraph 2.1 of this Appendix 5 (DDS
Charges):

2.2.1 by an amount equal to or less than £500,000, Post Office shall,
notwithstanding such shortfall, be deemed to have met such commitment in
respect of the given DDS Commitment Year provided that the Charges
within the four (4) month period immediately following the end of the
applicable DDS Commitment Year (the “Remedy Period”) exceed the
amount of the shortfall. For the avoidance of doubt, until such time as the
relevant shortfall is met, the Charges during the Remedy Period shall count
towards the shortfall only and not towards meeting any commitment in the
subsequent DDS Commitment Year (if applicable);

2.2.2 by an amount exceeding £500,000, Fujitsu Services may invoice Post Office
for the shortfall in excess of £500,000 and subsequently paragraph 2.2.1
shall apply in respect of the remaining £500,000 (by way of example, should
Post Office fail to meet the commitment by £600,000, Fujitsu Services may
invoice Post Office for £100,000, with the remaining £500,000 being then
subject to the Remedy Period specified within paragraph 2.2.1 of this
Appendix 5 (DDS Charges)); or

31st March 2022 and 31st March 2023) paragraphs 2.2.1 to 2.2.3 shall not apply.
Instead, if, in one of the final three DDS Commitment Years, Post Office exceeds the
DDS Commitment for that DDS Commitment Year then the excess shall be credited
against any shortfall in the DDS Commitment for the following DDS Commitment
Year. If, after applying such credit, there remains a shortfall within one of the final
three DDS Commitment Years then Fujitsu Services shall be entitled to invoice Post
Office for such shortfall at the end of the relevant DDS Commitment Year.

ORDERING OF SPRINT TEAM CAPACITY

Subject to paragraph 3.8 below, the parties shall agree the number of Sprint Teams.
at the Digital Demand Forecasting Board.

Sprint Teams shall be agreed and ordered in blocks of 6 Sprints to cover a 12-week
period.

Each block of Sprints shall be ordered at least 90 days in advance of their
commencement. For example, the Digital Demand Forecasting Board meeting in
March would order Sprints commencing no earlier than July

Post Office shall confirm the Sprint Team capacity in writing through the minutes of
the meeting and Fujitsu Services shall ensure that the ordered capacity is ready to
commence work in accordance with such order for each ordered Sprint.

Once ordered Sprints can only be adjusted on less than 90 days’ prior notice pursuant
to paragraph 3.6 (for the avoidance of doubt, this shall not affect the ability for the
Digital Demand Forecasting Board to adjust such Sprints with more than 90 days’
prior notice).

Where Post Office requests a change in accordance with paragraph 3.5 the following
shall apply;

3.6.1 Where there is a request to increase the number of Sprint Teams and using
reasonable endeavours Fujitsu Services is able to meet the request, Post
Office shall pay the Charges for such additional Sprint teams in accordance
with paragraph 1.6 above.

3.6.2 I Where there is a request to decrease the number of Sprint Teams allocated
to a specific Product or the number of Sprints then, in addition to the general
ability for the Digital Demand Forecasting Board to reallocate Sprint Teams
between Products, then with Fujitsu Services’ agreement, Post Office may
require the Sprint Teams that are the subject to the reduction request to
undertake other activities not contained within a Product Backlog
(‘Additional Activities’), provided that such Additional Activities are
reasonably within scope of the capabilities and expertise of the applicable

Sprint Team. In such circumstances: (i) the Charges for such Sprint Team
shall remain as scheduled for the applicable period; and (ii) any work
undertaken by such Sprint Team in respect of any Additional Activities shall
be excluded from any assessment of performance by such Sprint Team
pursuant to Appendix 8.

The parties have agreed the initial Sprint Team capacity (being two Sprint Teams)
and following the DDS Commencement Date, Fujitsu Services shall stand up this
number of Sprint Teams and this shall be the minimum number of Sprint Teams
during the first 90 day period following the DDS Commencement Date (the “Ramp-
Up Period”). During the Ramp-Up Period, Fujitsu Services agrees that Post Office
may increase the number of Sprint Teams up to a maximum of 4, provided that:

3.7.1 Post Office provides Fujitsu Services with at least 30 days’ prior notice of the
requirement for an additional Sprint Team;

3.7.2 I where more than 3 concurrent Sprint Teams will be required before 60 days
after the DDS Commencement Date, any additional requested concurrent
Sprint Teams will be subject to paragraph 3.6.1;

3.7.3. where more than 4 concurrent Sprint Teams will be required before 90 days
after the DDS Commencement Date, any additional requested concurrent
Sprint Teams will be subject to paragraph 3.6.1; and

3.7.4 each Sprint Team uses the Standard Sprint Team Structure.
The provisions of this paragraph 3.7 are without prejudice to paragraph 3.6.1.

Within 10 business days of the DDS Commencement Date the parties shall hold a
Digital Demand Forecasting Board and agree and or confirm the number of Sprint
Teams for the next block of 6 Sprints following the Ramp-Up Period.

Annex B contains worked examples of the planning approach for the initial Digital
Demand Forecasting Board.

APPENDIX 7
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS TRACKER

In determining whether the IPR in any of the Software to be created pursuant to a Product (or
a Release) is a Listed Right, the Fujitsu Services Architect Owner shall, as part of Product
Initiation consider the requirements and the manner in which the Sprint Requirements could
be delivered by Fujitsu Services. The Architect Owner will liaise with the Product Delivery
Manager and the Product Owner to discuss and agree the IPR strategy for the Product. An
agreed IPR strategy will be contained within the Product Initiation deliverables.

Any changes to the Product Initiation deliverables that relate to FJ Digital Background IPR, KS
IPR or Horizon IPR will be updated as part of any relevant Sprint Review. With respect to the
use of open source or third party IP Rights, recognising the requirement for the Sprint Team
to be able to deliver the User Stories in the most efficient manner possible, the use of any
such open source or third party IP Rights shall be tracked as part of the Sprint Review Report.

To the extent that there is a change to the Product requirements following Product Initiation
that relate to the usage of FJ Digital Background IPR, K5 IPR or Horizon IPR, the Fujitsu
Services Architect Owner shall escalate to the Product Owner and the Delivery Lead such that
the parties may agree upon any revision to the IPR strategy and the same will be tracked
within the updated Product Initiation deliverables accordingly. The parties acknowledge that
such a change in the Product may require the Sprint Team to be re-set prior to re-commencing
the Product delivery.

The Product Owner shall be responsible for ensuring that Post Office’s Chief Technical Office
(or nominated representative) agrees to the IPR strategy (including any changes to the IPR
strategy) with respect to any Sprint Requirement which is to be designed, coded or supplied
as a pre-existing component or an algorithm using any Listed Rights prior to formally approving
the Product to be delivered under DDS.

APPENDIX 8
SERVICE CREDIT MECHANISM

DEFINITIONS AND INTERPRETATION

In this Appendix, the following terms and expressions shall have the meaning set out
below:

“Average Sprint Performance” means in respect of a given Sprint Team, subject to
paragraph 3.1.3 of this Appendix 8 (Service Credit Mechanism), the average
Completion Rate over the previous six Sprints completed by such Sprint Team;

“Completion Rate” means in respect of a given Sprint, the percentage of Story Points
that were scheduled for completion during such Sprint that were actually completed
during such Sprint;

“Expected Service Level” means, in respect of a given Sprint, the expected target
percentage (as set out as the ‘expected’ percentage within Attachment 1 to this
Appendix 8 (Service Credit Mechanism)) of the Story Points due for completion during
such Sprint;

“Improvement Plan” has the meaning given to it in paragraph 4.1 of this Appendix 8
(Service Credit Mechanism);

“Minimum Service Level” means, in respect of a given Sprint, that at least 75% of the
Story Points due for completion during such Sprint were actually completed and
Accepted;

“Sprint Charges” means, in respect of any given Sprint, the total charges payable by
Post Office in respect of such Sprint;

“Sprint Service Credit” means, in respect of any given Sprint, ten per cent (10%) of
the Sprint Charges; and

“Threshold Service Level” means, in respect of a given Sprint, the threshold target
percentage (as set out as the ‘threshold’ percentage within Attachment 1 to this
Appendix 8 (Service Credit Mechanism)) of the Story Points.

SERVICE LEVEL PRINCIPLES

During each Sprint, Fujitsu Services shall provide the Services to a level that meets or
exceeds the Expected Service Level for such Sprint and Fujitsu Service’ performance
against this target shall be measured and reported in accordance with this Appendix.

3.1.1 During each Sprint, Fujitsu Services shall measure its performance against
the Expected Service Level, Threshold Service Level and Minimum Service
Level for such Sprint.

3.1.2 Within the DDS Service Review, Fujitsu Services and Post Office shall review
Fujitsu Services’ performance during the previous two Sprints. Fujitsu
Services shall provide sufficient evidence of its performance during such
Sprints to allow assessment of its performance.

3.1.3. Where the period for assessing the Average Sprint Performance of any given
Sprint Team includes any Disrupted Sprints, such Disrupted Sprints shall be
discounted from the calculated average. By way of example only, where the
relevant 6 month period contained 1 Disrupted Sprint, the Average Sprint
Performance shall be calculated as an average of the remaining 5 Sprints
within such period. Where the number of Disrupted Sprints within any such
period exceeds 2, the period shall be extended until an average can be taken
across at least 4 Sprints that are not Disrupted Sprints.

CORRECTIVE ACTION

Creation of an Improvement Plan

Where, in respect of any Sprint, the Completion Rate fails to meet the Expected
Service Level in respect of such Sprint, Fujitsu Services shall, within 5 business days
of the end of such Sprint, provide Post Office with a written plan for improving Fujitsu
Services’ performance, so as to improve Fujitsu Services’ performance and satisfy
such Service Levels in the future (an “Improvement Plan”) for Post Office's approval.
In the event that Post Office (acting reasonably) does not approve the Improvement
Plan, Fujitsu Services shall submit a revised plan to address Post Office’s concerns.
For the avoidance of doubt, an Improvement Plan may result in an individual resource
being removed from a Sprint Team where the parties agree that this is an appropriate
action to help to address Fujitsu Services’ performance issues).

Implementation of Improvement Plan

Upon Post Office’s approval, the Improvement Plan shall be implemented by Fujitsu
Services in accordance with the timescales set out in the Improvement Plan and
Fujitsu Services shall bear the cost of performing its obligations and responsibilities
under such Improvement Plan. During the implementation of such Improvement Plan,
Fujitsu Services shall provide to Post Office weekly status reports containing
progress updates until such time as Fujitsu Services’ performance is fully evidenced
to be in compliance with the applicable Service Level. For the avoidance of doubt, the
implementation of the Improvement Plan shall not relieve Fujitsu Services of any
obligations hereunder or from incurring additional Sprint Service Credits.

SPRINT SERVICE CREDITS

This paragraph 5 of Appendix 8 (Service Credit Mechanism) shall not apply until 1
November 2018.

Calculation
Where, in respect of any Sprint, the Completion Rate fails to meet:

(i) the Minimum Service Level (a “Minimum Service Level Default”); or

(ii) the Threshold Service Level (but does not fail to meet the applicable Minimum
Service Level) in respect of such Sprint and the Average Sprint Performance
by Fujitsu Services does not exceed the Threshold Service Level,

then, subject to paragraphs 5.3, 5.4 and 5.5 of this Appendix 8 (Service Credit
Mechanism), Fujitsu Services shall pay to Post Office an amount equal to the Sprint
Service Credit for the applicable Sprint, which shall be applied as a credit for the next
invoice as a separate line item.

In no circumstances will the total amounts payable by Fujitsu Services in Sprint Service
Credits for any given Sprint exceed 10% of the Sprint Charges for such Sprint.

Subject to paragraph 6.1 of this Appendix 8 (Service Credit Mechanism), but without
prejudice to paragraph 4 (Corrective Action), the payment of Sprint Service Credits
shall be the Post Office's sole remedy with respect to any failure to meet the Service
Levels.

Where a new Product is introduced to the DDS Service or a new Sprint Team
commences (as described in the table set out in Attachment 1 to this Appendix 8
(Service Credit Mechanism)), then the Threshold Service Level shall apply for the first
3 or 5 Sprints (as applicable) prior to it becoming set at the “Existing Team” levels. For
the purposes of calculating the Average Sprint Performance across 6 Sprints which
include new Products or new Sprint Teams, the Threshold Service Level will be
calculated as the average of the Threshold Service Level targets across all of the 6
Sprints for the purposes of determining whether a Sprint Team has meet the Average
Sprint Performance. An example of this process is set out beneath the table in
Attachment 1 to this Appendix 8 (Service Credit Mechanism).

TERMINATION

Where the average Completion Rate across any twelve (12) consecutive Sprints
across all Sprint Teams commencing at any time after 1 November 2018, fails to meet
the Threshold Service Level (“Critical Service Failure”), then, notwithstanding
paragraph 5.4 of this Appendix 8 (Service Credit Mechanism), provided that during
such period there were an average of at least four (4) Sprint Teams running
consecutively, Post Office may terminate the Digital Development Service a result of
Default by Fujitsu Services by giving Fujitsu Services no less than sixty (60) days’ prior
written notice. In the event of any Critical Service Failure, paragraph 5.4 of this
Appendix 8 (Service Credit Mechanism) shall cease to apply.

Development Services in accordance with this Schedule I3 in respect of all
other Products;

the Charges relating to the Product Roles and the Sprint Teams associated
with the terminated Product shall cease to apply from the date of termination
(the “Product Reduction Amount’) and the Charges related to the Platform
Standing Team Charges and the Oversight Roles Charges shall be reviewed
by the parties with a view to reducing them by a percentage equal to the
average Sprint Team Charges for the affected Product(s) over the previous 6
month period as a proportion of the DDS Charges (excluding the Platform
Standing Team Charges, Oversight Roles Charges and Tooling Charges)
until such time as new Products are introduced or additional concurrent Sprint
Teams are engaged to support existing Products that require additional
resources within the Platform Standing Team or Oversight Roles, or such
other proportion taking reasonable account of the continued provision of DDS
(the “Product Reduction Percentage”). The DDS Commitment for the
remainder of the current DDS Commitment Year and for each subsequent
DDS Commitment Year shall also be reduced by the Product Reduction
Amount and, for so long as it applies, by a percentage equivalent to the
Product Reduction Percentage; and

the annual liability cap referenced in Clause 14.1(ii) shall be reduced by the
Product Reduction Amount for each subsequent year of the DDS Term and,
for so long as it applies, (for each subsequent year of the DDS Term) by a
percentage equivalent to the Product Reduction Percentage.

SCHEDULE 14

K5 CLOUD SERVICES

INTRODUCTION

This Schedule shall not apply in the circumstances where Post Office (or a third party
acting on behalf of Post Office) has direct access to the K5 cloud platform for the
purposes of test and development in a separate environment to the Horizon
production environments. In such circumstances, such access and use of the KS
cloud platform shall be undertaken pursuant to clause 76.

Paragraph 2 of this Schedule sets out the provisions that shall apply in respect of the
Cloud Services, amending or supplementing the terms and conditions of the
Agreement as they apply to the Cloud Services.

SUPPLEMENTARY TERMS

Termination

2.1.1

Subject to paragraph 2.1.2, Fujitsu Services may, upon not less than 12
months’ prior written notice elect to discontinue all or part of the K5 Cloud
Services (such as, but not limited to, where Fujitsu Limited or Fujitsu
Services closes the K5 cloud platform or no longer supports a particular
element which is needed by the Post Office), in which case, Fujitsu Services
shall, at its cost, migrate the Cloud Services to an alternative platform as
may be selected by Fujitsu Services provided that: (i) Fujitsu Services has
acted reasonably and sought to take into consideration any concerns raised
by Post Office as to such alternative platform; and (ii) the alternative platform
provides a service that is equivalent to or better than the K5 Cloud Services
with respect to performance, functionality and security. Fujitsu Services
agrees that the total Charges payable by the Post Office for the Cloud
Services shall be unaffected notwithstanding the migration to the alternative
platform. Subject to paragraph 2.1.2, in the event that the Post Office incurs
any costs as a result of any such move to an alternative platform, Fujitsu
shall be liable to the Post Office for such reasonably demonstrable costs
provided that these shall not exceed £1,000,000.

Paragraph 2.1.1 shall not apply with respect to the implementation of those
projects that are agreed between the parties as using the K5 cloud platform
only on a temporary basis prior to migration to an alternative cloud platform
(currently being HNGT, HIH and Agent's Portal). Instead, the movement of
such projects to alternative cloud platforms is hereby agreed by Post Office,
subject to the costs of such movement being agreed by the parties.

No Direct Access

2.2.1

The parties agree that the Post Office shall not have the right to directly
access the K5 cloud platform and will not be provided with any administration
tights to do so. Any access by the Post Office (or any of its personnel, agents
or subcontractors) shall be a breach of this Agreement. Should Post Office

Schedule I4 Version 14.0
Page 2 of 4
CONFIDENTIAL

2.2.2

FUJ00234786

FUJ00234786

request any such direct access, Fujitsu Services shall deny such request
and escalate the same to the Post Office’s Group ClO. In the event that
Post Office repeatedly breaches the provisions of this paragraph 2.2.1,
Fujitsu Services shall be entitled (provided it has first escalated the same to
the Post Office’s Group CIO), on no less than six months’ prior written notice
to the Post Office, to migrate Post Office to an alternative platform and Post
Office shall pay the reasonable costs associated with such move. Fujitsu
Services shall nevertheless maintain the provision of the Services
throughout any such migration.

In the event that Post Office subsequently wishes to have (or wishes one of
its subcontractors or agents to have) direct access to the K5 cloud platform,
the parties will agree any necessary operational changes to the Cloud
Services.

2.3 Changes

2.3.1

2.3.2

2.3.3

2.3.4

2.3.5

Fujitsu Services may: (i) change and discontinue at its discretion any of the
Cloud Services; (ii) change or remove features or functionality of any of the
Cloud Services from time to time; and (iii) change the Service Descriptions
relating to the Cloud Services. Unless paragraph 2.3.2 below applies, such
a change will not require approval from the Post Office.

Where any proposed change is material and may degrade the functionality,
performance or security of the Cloud Services, in the reasonable opinion of
the parties (as discussed in the appropriate governance forum), Fujitsu
Services will provide the Post Office with at least 3 months’ prior written
notice before such change is implemented and the parties will agree the
manner in which the effects of the change can be mitigated. Where
appropriate mitigations are not possible, Fujitsu Services shall migrate the
Cloud Services to an alternative platform in accordance with the provisions
of paragraph 2.1.

For the avoidance of doubt, where any change to the Cloud Services may
impact any software licensed to Post Office by a third party independently of
Fujitsu Services, such change shall be assessed in accordance with
paragraphs 2.3.1 and 2.3.2.

Without prejudice to clause 4, the parties will include, as an item within the
appropriate governance forum, a forward-looking schedule of changes to the
Cloud Services. Fujitsu Services will use its reasonable endeavours to keep
the list up dated such that, where possible, changes proposed are included
at least 6 months in advance.

The parties agree that prior to the commencement of any Services that make
use of the K5 cloud platform in a live environment, the parties will agree
through the Change Control Procedure any necessary changes to the

service descriptions within the Agreement that relate to the use of the Cloud
Services.

2.4 Customer Content

241

24.2

Post Office is responsible for the Customer Content and: (a) shall ensure
that it does not, and that its End Users do not, use the Cloud Services to
transmit any Customer Content which is unlawful, fraudulent, defamatory,
offensive, obscene or that may bring Fujitsu Services or any other member
of its group’s reputation into disrepute or cause harm or damage in respect
of any person, entity, network or system; (b) shall obtain all necessary
permissions to use, provide, store and process Customer Content; and (c)
shall grant Fujitsu Services permission to use Customer Content to provide
the Cloud Services to the Post Office and any End Users.

“Customer Content” means the data, information and material, including
the Application Software and any data, text, audio, video, images or other
content, that the Post Office or the End User provider, transmits or stores
using any of the Cloud Services, excluding any such data, information or
material created or provided by Fujitsu Services.

2.5 Information Security

2.5.1

Fujitsu Services may install an intrusion detection system (“IDS”) in Fujitsu
Services’ equipment in order to help detect communications attempting to
disrupt or disable any of the Cloud Services, hack into Fujitsu Services’
equipment, or perform hacking using Fujitsu Services equipment, including
equipment installed for providing the Cloud Services (collectively,
“Offensive Communication’). The contents of any communications with
Fujitsu Services’ equipment or using Fujitsu Services’ equipment may be
verified by Fujitsu Services through the IDS to determine whether such
communications are Offensive Communications. Fujitsu Services may
tabulate and analyse the records of Offensive Communication obtained with
the IDS, create statistical data, and use and process the same only for
purposes of improving the security of any of the Cloud Services, the Fujitsu
Environment and Fujitsu Services’ other products and services.

2.6 Acts of Emergency

2.6.1

In the event of an emergency and where necessary to protect the integrity
of the Cloud Services or to manage or prevent a security risk, Fujitsu
Services may temporarily interrupt the Cloud Services and Fujitsu Services
shall use reasonable efforts to notify the Post Office promptly upon any such
requirement. For the avoidance of doubt, no such interruption shall act to
relieve Fujitsu Services from its obligations to provide the Services in
accordance with the Service Levels, nor shall it in any way act as a relief
event in respect of any such Service Levels.

Schedule 16
Payment and Banking Service: Service Description
1. BACKGROUND
Ll Payment and Banking Service is a set of management services and infrastructure components

that have been deployed by Fujitsu Services in conjunction with its Sub-contractor Ingenico.
The Payment and Banking Service is developed to interact with the HNG-X System to provide
the following Business Capabilities and Support Facilities:

(a) the Banking Business Capability, as described in paragraph 2.5 of
Schedule B3.2 of the Agreement;

(b) the management of payments using the Debit Card and Credit Card
methods of payment within the Payment Management Business
Capability, as described in paragraphs 2.10.4 - 2.10.8 of Schedule B3.2 of
the Agreement; and

(ce) the Transaction Management Support Facility, as described within
paragraph 3.4 of Schedule B3.2 of the Agreement.

Payment and Banking Service was implemented to reduce the scope of the Card Data
Environment (CDE) within the HNG-X System, it communicates all Cardholder Data point-
to-point encrypted within the Payment and Banking Solution. As the encryption keys are
unavailable to Fujitsu Services and Post Office, all data in scope of PCI DSS (Cardholder
Data and Account Data (P2PE)) for PBS Transactions are not accessible by Fujitsu Services
or Post Office as part of the transaction process. Access to encrypted PANs within the HNG-
X System does remain in relation to reconciliation however, this shall continue until
GlobalPayments, Vocalink and American Express implement changes to mask the PANs
communicated in reconciliation data. Unless explicitly stated otherwise in this Service
Description, no other Schedule B Schedule, Service Descriptions or CCDs shall apply to this
Payment and Banking Service.

DEFINITIONS
In this Schedule 16, the following terms shall have the following meanings:

“AXIS Software” means the software hosted on the Ingenico Central Platform;

“C3 BTA Software” means the components of the C3 Software that support PBS Banking
Transactions;

“C3 CPA Software” means the components of the C3 Software that supports EMV Payment
Transactions;

“C3 Software” means the firmware deployed onto the PIN Pad, including the C3 CPA
Sofiware and the C3 BTA Software;

“Ingenico” means Fujitsu Services Sub-contractor, Ingenico Retail Enterprise (UK) Limited,
and (as the context requires) its subcontractors;

3.2.1

3.2.1

Schedule I6 V14.0
Page 3 of 34

The Ingenico Central Platform is a network, hardware and software infrastructure,
including the AXIS Software, and transactional databases, centrally hosted and
operated in a fully redundant environment by Ingenico, ensuring the concentration
of PBS Transaction flows from Counter Positions, their processing links with the
Acquirers! centres and the archiving of PBS Transaction history. This includes:

a) The configuration of acceptance contracts;

b) The routing of electronic PBS Transaction flows from Branch Hardware on
IP links;

c) Aggregation of PBS Transactions' data on central servers;

d) Delivery of PBS Transaction and authorisation data to (as applicable)
Acquirer centres and/or Vocalink;

e) The creation and transmission of settlement data to the Acquirer; and

f) Protection of card data exchanged and stored on the Ingenico Central
Platform according to the PCI DSS security rules.

1.1 Card types accepted

The types of cards accepted by the solution are detailed in the CCD entitled “Axis
Managed Payment Service Solution - Solution Design” (DES/APP/MAN/3760).

1.2 Multi-Acquirer Architecture

The PBS Transaction service is based on a multi-Acquirer architecture allowing the
configuration of multiple Acquirer contracts. Routing to different acquiring hosts
can be established via provisioning configuration. However, for the avoidance of
doubt, any change to Post Office Acquirer(s) or Vocalink must be made via the
Change Control Procedure, to ensure the change is adequately configured and tested
prior to release to the production environment.

1.3 Connectivity

The connectivity between the C3 Software and the Ingenico Central Platform is
based on TCP/IP protocol. The dialogues are always initiated by the C3 Software
towards the AXIS Software server of the Ingenico Central Platform. The link
between the Ingenico Central Platform and the Acquirer may use the X25, XoT or
IP protocols via Ingenico's dedicated access points, depending on the connectivity
requirement of the Acquirer. The detailed connectivity infrastructure deployed is
detailed in the CCD entitled “Axis Managed Payment Service Solution - Solution
Design” (DES/APP/MAN/3760).

-14  P2PE

The point to point encryption (P2PE) service enables card data encryption between
the PIN Pad and the Ingenico Central Platform. To enable this, PIN Pads must first
be activated in Ingenico's PCI-P2PE certified customisation centre and deployed
according to PCI P2PE rules.
CONFIDENTIAL

FUJ00234786

FUJ00234786

The PIN Pad is activated by means of a P2PE encryption key injected according to
a PCI P2PE certified process, transported and deployed at Post Office sites
according to the rules defined by the PCI P2PE standard. The P2PE functionality
reduces the Post Office PCI DSS certification perimeter provided that Post Office
has implemented the P2PE Implementation Manual (PIM) issued by Fujitsu
Services and set out in the CRD entitled “P2PE Implementation Manual” ([@]), and
that Ingenico is referenced by the PCI-SSC as the P2PE compliant solution supplier.
Fujitsu Services shall maintain the certification on PIN Pads and a defined
application scope.

3.2.1.1.5 Asset Tracking via Web Portal

The P2PE Asset Management Service, as described in the CCD entitled “P2Pe Asset
Management Service: Service Description” (SVM/SDM/SD/3756) is accessed via
the Web Portal. It enables Post Office to manage the deployment of its PIN Pads
over their entire life cycle, from delivery to Post Office to being scrapped. This
service allows Post Office to manage the status specified in the P2PE
Implementation Manual (PIM), and to generate inventory discrepancies as required
by the PIM.

3.2.1.1.6 I Content Remote Download

The remote download feature allows the download, to all or part of the Post Office
estate of PIN Pads, of content specific to Post Office, such as logo, image, video,
etc. Post Office shall provide content for download to PIN Pads to Fujitsu Services
and define how the download campaign should progress, as part of service requests
for campaigns to be setup and initiated. Fujitsu Services will then ensure that the
content is downloaded to PIN Pads by Ingenico accordingly.

For information purposes only, Ingenico will initiate a campaign to coordinate any
specific downloads required to the PIN Pad estate. Each campaign will be designed
to the specific nature of the downloads being pushed to the PIN Pad estate, as this
could differ from a simple screensaver update, to a new version of a component
application on the PIN Pad.

Ingenico manages campaigns so that there are no more than approximately 200
concurrent PIN Pad downloads at any single point in time; however, there can be
multiple downloads over a single night to address more than 200 actual PIN Pads.
Any PIN Pad campaigns initiated will be subject to an agreed schedule with Post
Office.

3.2.1.2. The PBS Transaction Service for EMV Payment Transactions

3.2.1.2.1 C3 CPA Software

The C3 CPA Software provides the interface between the in-Branch components
(Counter Position and PIN Pad application) and the AXIS Software servers of the
Ingenico Central Platform for EMV Payment Transaction processing. The C3 CPA
Software connects to the Ingenico Central Platform via TCP/IP.

.2.3 Payment environments

As part of the PBS Transaction service, the following payment mechanisms are
supported:

© Local in Branch payments

o Host to Host Refunds direct from Fujitsu Services’ HNG-X System, as
defined the Batch Process Functional Specification (Reference to be added)

The latter allows HNG-X Application initiated refunds and reversals. Via an
interface between the HNG-X Application and the AXIS Software server of the
Ingenico Central Platform, automated reversals or refunds of EMV Payment
Transactions can be made in respect of EMV Payment Transactions which failed or
were cancelled, either at the Counter Position or otherwise by the HNG-X System,
after the EMV Payment Transaction.

2.4 Degraded Mode

This paragraph details the functionality provided by the Payment and Banking
Solution to support a degraded mode of operation. For the avoidance of doubt,
this functionality, whilst stated here is not configured for live operation for Post
Office. If required, this could be enabled for future operation using the Change
Control Procedure.

In the event of a failure of the communication between the C3 CPA Software and
the AXIS Software server of the Ingenico Central Platform, the Payment and
Banking Service may, according to an associated parameterization, continue to
operate in “degraded” mode: the C3 CPA Software, without access to any
communication with the AXIS Software server of the Ingenico Central Platform,
must then process the EMV Payment Transaction locally, with a limit of behaviour
and amount defined between Post Office and the Acquirer. Any payment options
which can only be processed “online” with the Acquirer will not be supported in
“degraded” mode.

When operating in “degraded” mode, Post Office must note that the PIN Pad may
store EMV Payment Transactions locally. In order to be remitted to the bank, said
EMV Payment Transactions must therefore be sent to the AXIS server of the
Ingenico Central Platform, before any replacement, maintenance or withdrawal of
such PIN Pad(s) is performed.

Post Office must ensure that all EMV Payment Transactions performed in
“degraded” mode, and therefore stored locally on the PIN Pad, can be sent to the
AXIS server of the Ingenico Central Platform, either by Post Office or its sub-
contractors or by Fujitsu Services, as soon as possible.
CONFIDENTIAL

FUJ00234786

FUJ00234786

3.2.1.2.5 Offline Mode

This paragraph details the functionality provided by the Payment and Banking
Solution to support an Offline Mode of operation. For the avoidance of doubt,
this functionality, whilst stated here is not configured for live operation for Post
Office. If required, this could be enabled for future operation using the Change
Control Procedure.

In the case of failure of the communication between the Ingenico Central Platform
and the computer system of the Acquiring centres, the payment application may,
according to the payment card processing rules, accept certain Transactions. It is
said that these EMV Payment Transactions are carried out “offline”.

Cards that require an authorisation request, with a required positive response from
the Acquirer centre, cannot be accepted in this mode of operation. Cards that do not
require authorisation may be accepted.

The acceptance of a card in “offline” processing must meet the acceptance rules of
the Acquirer and the issuer of the card.

3.2.1.3. The PBS Transaction Service for PBS Banking Transactions

3.2.1.3.1 C3 BTA Software

The C3 BTA Software provides the interface between the in-Branch components
(Counter Position and PIN Pad application) and the AXIS Software servers of the
Ingenico Central Platform for PBS Banking Transactions. The C3 BTA Sofiware
connects to the Ingenico Central Platform via TCP/IP.

3.2.1.3.2 Protocols and supported countries

As part of the PBS Transaction service, the following countries and Acquirers’
protocols are supported for PBS Banking Transactions:

Country Protocol

UK VOCALINK LISS

3.2.1.3.3. Payment Environments

As part of the PBS Transaction service, the following transaction environments are
supported:

© Local in branch payment

o Host to Host Reversals direct from Fujitsu Services back office systems (via
Webservice)

The latter allows HNG-X Application initiated refunds and reversals. Via an
interface between the HNG-X Application and the AXIS Server of the Ingenico
Central Platform, automated reversals or refunds of PBS Banking Transactions can
be made in respect of Transactions which failed or were cancelled, either at the
Counter Position or otherwise by the HNG-X System, after the PBS Banking
Transaction.

3.2.1.3.4  Multi-Acquirer Architecture

The PBS Transaction service is based on a multi-Acquirer architecture allowing the
configuration of multiple Acquirer contracts. However all PBS Banking
Transactions will be routed to Vocalink as the processing host.

3.2.1.3.5 Degraded mode

There is no Degraded Mode to support PBS Banking Transactions. In the event of a
failure of the communication between the C3 BTA Software and the AXIS server
of the Ingenico Central Platform, PBS Banking Transactions will not be accepted as
all PBS Banking Transactions must be performed fully online to the Vocalink host.

3.2.1.3.6 Offline mode

There is no Offline Mode to support PBS Banking Transactions. In the case of
failure of the communication between the Ingenico Central Platform and the
computer system of the Acquiring centres, PBS Banking Transactions will not be
accepted as all PBS Banking Transactions must be performed fully online to the
Vocalink host.

3.2.1.4 Web Portal

The Web Portal, delivered by the Ingenico Central Platform, is an online reporting
and monitoring tool. Web Portal provides mechanisms to view and search on PIN
Pad and EMV Payment Transaction and PBS Banking Transaction data.

Pro-active monitoring of the Ingenico Central Platform and AXIS Software

Fujitsu Services shall (acting via Ingenico) actively monitor the operations and
performance of the Ingenico Central Platform and the AXIS Software twenty-four
(24) hours per day, every day of the year. Any service impacting Incidents identified
through monitoring will be managed to resolution using the Incident Management
processes as described below. Fujitsu Services will report PI or P2 priority Incidents
for the Payment and Banking Service whenever they are identified, P3 priority
Incidents for the Payment and Banking Service identified outside of the hours of
availability of the Payment and Banking Service will be reported the next Working
Day.

Post Office and Fujitsu Services nominated users will also be given access to a
customised dashboard displaying metrics of performance data for the Ingenico
Central Platform and AXIS Software.

Incident Management, including Major Incident Management

Fujitsu Services will be responsible for informing Post Office of any Payment and
Banking Service affecting Incidents identified by Fujitsu Services or its Sub-
contractors.

The Payment and Banking Service will conform to the Fujitsu Services POA
Incident management process as defined in the Working Document entitled: “POA
Operations Incident Management Process” (SVM/SDM/PRO/0018).

entitled: “POA Major Incident Process” (SVM/SDM/PRO/0001).

Problem Management

The Payment and Banking Service will conform to the Fujitsu Services POA
problem management process as defined in the Working Document entitled:
“Interface Agreement for the Problem Management Interface” (CS/IFS/008).

Problem records will be created and maintained to review all P1 Incidents,
regardless of whether or not the Service Levels in respect of such Incident were met,
or whenever the Parties identify a trend in Service Level performance which
reasonably indicates that there may be a future P1 Incident. Fujitsu Services and/or
its Sub-contractors will perform root cause analysis (RCA) investigations for these
problem records and report their findings within seven (7) Working Days.

For P2 Incidents, an informal update on the cause of the Incident will be provided
to Post Office, including any additional actions required to prevent such Incidents
from happening again.

If the Parties identify a trend in Service Level performance, which reasonably
indicates that there will be a future P1 or P2 Incident, a root cause analysis of the
trend will be performed. The findings will be reported to Post Office and any
necessary steps to prevent an actual P1 or P2 Incident indicated by such root-cause
analysis will be taken.

Payment and Banking Solution Configuration and Operational Change Proposal
Management

Fujitsu Services will notify Post Office of all scheduled changes to be made to the
Payment and Banking Solution and unless otherwise agreed shall carry out
maintenance work on the Payment and Banking Solution between 00:30 and 06:00
(UK time), Sunday to Thursday (inclusive), as follows;

a) Minimum notice period prior to maintenance: four (4) Working Days,
except where Fujitsu Services believes (acting reasonably) that a failure to
perform the maintenance operations may lead to a P1 or P2 Incident, in
which case such notice must be received no less than one (1) Working Day;

b) Fujitsu Services will notify and seck agreement from Post Office for the
above scheduled changes. Any agreement from Post Office will not be
unreasonably withheld. In the event that the Parties are not able to gain
agreement, and where Fujitsu Services can demonstrate that it is required
scheduled maintenance; then Fujitsu Services will not be liable for failure
to meet any Service Levels or obligations within this Payment and Banking
Service which would not have occurred had the change taken place, until
such times as the scheduled maintenance has been executed.

c) As part of monthly reporting for the Payment and Banking Service (as
described in paragraph 3.4.8 of this Service Description) Fujitsu Services
will report on the success of all scheduled maintenance that has taken place
CONFIDENTIAL

in the previous month. Any unscheduled maintenance performed as a result
of Incidents, such as any emergency changes, will also be reported on.

d) For all maintenance outside the above windows, Post Office may notify
Fujitsu Services of any concerns they may reasonably have. In this scenario,
the Parties will work together to agree the best conditions to perform the
maintenance.

Fujitsu Services will raise Operational Change Proposals to notify Post Office of
scheduled changes to be made by Ingenico. The Payment and Banking Service will
create and/or impact Operational Change Proposals for operational changes in
accordance with the CCD entitled: “Service Management Service, Service
Description” (SVM/SDM/SD/0007).

A freeze period is a period of time during which scheduled downtime cannot be
carried out. Fujitsu Services shall on an annual basis notify Post Office of its freeze
period(s) for the forthcoming year for the Payment and Banking Service one (1)
month before any freeze period is set. The parties shall, acting reasonably, discuss
and to the extent operationally feasible adjust the proposed freeze period(s) to fit
requirements.

Whilst performing maintenance or repairs during any scheduled downtime or
unscheduled downtime, Fujitsu Services shall use all reasonable endeavours to
minimise the impact on the Payment and Banking Service.

Post Office shall notify Fujitsu Services of a freeze period for the Payment and
Banking Service one (1) month before any freeze period is set. Should this freeze
period restrict Fujitsu Services from performing required maintenance that would
be required to maintain the platform and the Service Level Targets of the Payment
and Banking Services (set out in this Schedule 6), then Fujitsu Services will not be
subject to any liquidated damages (payable in accordance with clause 18 (Service
Level Remedies)) accrued during the freeze period that would have been prevented
had Fujitsu Services been able to undertake the required maintenance.

Configuration Management in Support of the Operational Business Change (Branch
Change) Service

The Payment and Banking Service will manage the configuration of PIN Pads,
including MID & TID data, in support of the Operational Business Change (Branch
Change) Service when making changes in the configuration of Branches and
Counter Positions.

The allocation of identification numbers (MID & TID) to a C3 Software enabled
PIN Pad and configuration of the AXIS Software to accept transactions from that
PIN Pad, in respect of an Operational Business Change request, will constitute an
Activation to the Payment and Banking Service. After the initial roll-out of the
Payment and Banking Service to the Branch estate the first 2,000 Activations per
year is included in the Charges for the Payment and Banking Service. All
Activations over and above this first 2,000 will be charged at the rate as identified

Service Level Targets and Remedies
All Service Levels and Key Performance Indicators will be measured over a calendar month.

The Service Level Targets in the remainder of this paragraph which relate to an Incident shall
be measured from the point at which that Incident is received by Ingenico. Fujitsu Services
shall route Incidents or other Payment and Banking Service needs to Ingenico promptly and
efficiently for Payment and Banking Service (having regard to the severity of the Incident and
relevant response and resolution times) but in any event no later than fifteen (15) minutes after
assessing that Ingenico are the appropriate party for resolution), within the usual working
practices of the other HNG-X Services.

3.4.1 Transaction Performance of the Ingenico Central Platform

The performance of the Ingenico Central Platform shall be calculated by measuring the
transaction processing time for EMV Payment and PBS Banking Transactions. This shall be
measured as follows:

¢ For EMV Payment Transactions. This shall be measured as transit time from receipt
at the perimeter of the network ingress point of the Ingenico Central Platform to
despatch of authorisation response to the PIN Pad from the network egress point of
the Ingenico Central Platform, minus any time taken from the Acquirer(s) to provide
a response back to the Ingenico Central Platform. This shall be measured as the
average EMV Payment Transaction processing time over a calendar month.

e For PBS Banking Transactions. This shall be measured as transit time from receipt at
the perimeter of the network ingress point of the Ingenico Central Platform to
despatch of authorisation response to the PIN Pad from the network egress point of
the Ingenico Central Platform, minus anytime taken from Vocalink to provide a
response back to the Ingenico Central Platform. This shall be measured as the average
PBS Banking Transaction processing time over a calendar month.

CONFIDENTIAL

Fujitsu Services shall process EMV Payment Transactions and PBS Banking Transactions on
the Ingenico Central Platform within the following timeframes:

Average of all EMV Payment Transactions processed over a 2.0 seconds
calendar month

Average of all PBS Banking Transactions processed over a =< 2.0 seconds
calendar month

The transaction processing time Service Level Target for PBS Banking Transactions is an
SLT that Fujitsu Services are committed to achieving. However, this cannot be finalised until
development, testing and piloting of the Payment and Banking Solution in a Live Production
environment is completed. It is therefore agreed, that this Service Level Target shall be
reviewed and agreed as part of progressing beyond Payment and Banking Service Trigger
Point PBS6.

Table I in paragraph 3.4.10 of this Service Description adds further detail to the above Service
Level Target, in which:

¢ SLA-EMV1.1 relates to the processing of EMV Payment Transactions against this
transaction processing time SLT.

¢ SLA-BANK1.2 relates to the processing of PBS Banking Transactions against this
transaction processing time SLT.

* Both SLA-EMVI.1 and SLA-BANK1.2 will be reported over a calendar month,
however only SLA-BANK 1.2 will be subject to liquidated damages.

3.4.1.1 Exclusions.

The following events are excluded from measuring the performance of the Ingenico
Central Platform:

a) any failures of applications which are not maintained or provided by Fujitsu
Services or its Subcontractors that impact the Payment and Banking
Solution receiving a correctly formatted request to process a PBS Banking
or EMV Payment Transaction;

b) any failures of integration with third party components resulting from
changes that are not covered by an approved Operational Change Proposal
or CWO; and

¢) any network connectivity issue resulting from any failure or degradation of
service, including the inability of PIN Pads to connect to the Ingenico
Central Platform, other than where such connectivity failure results from an

act, omission or breach by Fujitsu Services;
3.4.2 Availability of the Ingenico Central Platform

The Ingenico Central Platform will be available, to support and enable Post Office Branches
in making EMV Payment Transactions and PBS Banking Transactions (subject to any agreed

The availability target is applicable to the Ingenico Central Platform that supports both EMV
Payment and PBS Banking Transactions.

Schedule I6 V14.0
Page 15 of 34

3.4.2.1 Calculating Availability for EMV Payment Transactions and PBS
Banking Transactions

An unsuccessful EMV Payment Transaction or PBS Banking Transaction is a PBS
Transaction for which the Ingenico Central Platform does not, receive the
authorisation or decline (as applicable) due to an Ingenico system issue.

The current configuration of the Payment and Banking Solution does not enable
offline mode or degraded mode for EMV Payment Transactions. Hence, the
availability rate described below is a combined measure for EMV Payment and PBS
Banking Transactions. Should Post Office request to enable these features in the
future for EMV Payment Transactions using the Change Control Procedure, then
these availability rate calculations will be modified to bring this into effect.

The availability rate of the Ingenico Central Platform for successful EMV Payment
and PBS Banking Transactions, against all PBS Transactions (excluding Exclusions,
as described in paragraph 3.4.2.2 below), shall be calculated as;

As TSH — TUDT x

TSH 100

Where;
A=% of Availability over a calendar month

TSH = Total Service Hours (total time within Core Availability Hours in the
calendar month - Exclusions)

TUDT = Total unscheduled downtime (i.e. duration of all Incidents in period)
(hours)

Table I in paragraph 3.4.10 of this Service Description adds further detail to the
above Service Level Target, detailing it as; SLA2.1, SLA2.2, SLA2.3 and SLA2.4
for availability for EMV Payment Transactions; and SLA2.5, SLA2.6, SLA2.7 and
SLA2.8 for PBS Banking Transactions.

The following examples are based on a 229h per calendar month period, using June
2020 as an example reporting period.

Example 2:

A total of 5 minutes Incident duration in a calendar month.

Total Service Hours: 229
Incident Duration: 5 minutes (0.083 hours)

Service Availability: (229 - 0.083))/229 = 99,96% availability (no

scheduled changes made in accordance with the process as described in
paragraph 3.2.5 of this Service Description;

any failures of applications (other than the Ingenico Central Platform) used
by Post Office which are not maintained or provided by Ingenico and which
cause the unavailability of the Ingenico Central Platform;

any failures of integration with third party components resulting from
changes made by Post Office outside the Change Control Procedure and
which cause the unavailability of the Ingenico Central Platform; and

any network connectivity issue resulting from Vocalink or Post Office
connectivity supplier failure, including the inability of PIN Pads to connect
to the Ingenico Central Platform, other than where such connectivity failure
results from an act, omission or breach by Fujitsu Services.

Settlement File Generation and Transmitting

Fujitsu Services (acting via Ingenico) shall submit all settlement files of EMV Payment
Transactions to the Acquirer by the Acquirer cut off times specified in the CCD entitled “Axis
Managed Payment Service Solution - Solution Design” (DES/APP/MAN/3760). The cut-off
point for processing EMV Payment Transactions for daily settlement data generation will be
23:00, and will submit the Settlement file to GlobalPayments by 04:00 the next day. Any
change to this time or to the Acquirer will be addressed using the Change Control Procedure.

Ingenico shall submit the settlement files to each Acquirer by such time which allows them
to re-attempt the submission if the first attempt fails. If both attempts fail Fujitsu Services will
notify Post Office of the failure in writing.

The functionality available at each Counter
Position for serving Customers shall comprise
one or more Business Capabilities in paragraph
2 of Schedule B3.2.

The provision of each Business Capability is
dependent on one or more of the Support
Facilities described in paragraph 3 of Schedule
B3.2.

Subject Matter

Fujitsu may process Personal Data under the
Existing Agreement for the purposes set out in
the Existing Agreement (if any), and otherwise
in the furtherance of the arrangements
between the parties, in each case in connection
with the provision of IT related services.

Duration of the processing

Commercial data is transitory in HNG-X, except
that it is held in Audit (for at least seven years)
and for support purposes in other systems (for

up to 365 days).

See details under The return and destruction of
the data below.

Nature

Fujitsu will process data in the following ways:

1. Data processed by Fujitsu without
transformation, logging or archiving, or
without transformation but with logging
and/or archiving.

The majority of the transaction types that run
in HNG-X/HNG-A utilise “AP-ADC scripts”,
implemented and maintained by Post Office or
its agents outside the change control processes
operated by Fujitsu.

Fujitsu relies on the PO to provide knowledge of
the data captured by any AP-ADC script and
may not understand the nature or purposes of
processing such transactions on behalf of Post
Office and third-party consumers of the data
with whom Post Office Limited has a
commercial arrangement.

AP-ADC scripts may use Fujitsu Horizon
frameworks and components to collect,
validate and exchange data with third parties
without Fujitsu being aware of the nature of
the data collected, transmitted or stored within
archives.

2. Data is processed and optionally archived
in Data Centre Services via various Business
Capabilities.

Processing activities such as storage, retrieval,

analysis, data collection, transformation and

data transfer may all be undertaken by Fujitsu
as follows:

(Near) Real-Time Data processing

¢ Passed in Real-time or Near Real Time
(periodically) TO a third party consumer of the

Type of Personal Data

The Post Office Limited has not informed
Fujitsu of all of the data captured, transmitted
and recorded in the Fujitsu systems that Post
Office Limited believes to Personal Data under
GDPR.

The type of personal data processed varies
across the supported Business Capabilities and
transaction types within those Capabilities.

As Data Processor, Fujitsu is involved in
collecting data, or processing data, according to
Post Office requirements, this includes meeting
specific system interface specifications
determined by third party consumers of that
data (with whom Post Office maintains a
contractual relationship, but Fujitsu do not).

Fujitsu therefore relies on Post Office to
establish and maintain Fujitsu’s understanding
and awareness of ALL Personal Data and
Special Category Personal Data which Post
Office requires to be collected, processed or
audited. Fujitsu relies on Post Office Limited to
maintain an awareness/knowledge of the data
captured by any AP-ADC script, as this is
defined by the script author (Post Office Limited
or their agent) and typically to meet an
interface of a third-party consumer of the data
with whom Post Office Limited has a
commercial arrangement.

In the absence of such a definition, Data items
can only be definitively specified by Fujitsu as
being captured for Non-APADC transactions
where the capture of data is defined within Post
Office Use Cases (such as PS-12 Postal Services),
or in well-defined data mapping specifications
(Generic and interstage Web Services). Where
that is true references will be made to the
HNG-X project repository version of the
relevant interface specifications which HNG-X
implements

behalf of British Gas which enables an
individual to top up the electricity meter in a
branch that supports this service.

The individual presents the token to a Post
Office branch counter employee which
launches the transaction, and then informs the
PO employee of the amount to be topped up.
Following the transaction launch, the Post.
Office system interacts directly with the British
Gas system in real-time, with the purpose of
authenticating and accepting the transaction.
After successful authentication and an
acceptance of the payment amount, a payment
is collected and a receipt of the transaction is
then printed and provided to the customer.
