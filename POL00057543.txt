KHAYYAM ISHAQ

ADVICE

1. Prosecution Case.

On 8" February 2011 a member of the Network Support Field Team attended
the Birkenshaw Post Office branch in Bradford to undertake a check of the
cash. A count of the cash took place and revealed a shortage of £536. The
balance snapshot revealed a discrepancy shortage of £2569.19. A full audit

was subsequently carried out which revealed a total shortage of £21168.64.

Mr. Ishaq was the sub postmaster at the Birkenshaw Post Office branch at the
time and he was interviewed under caution on 7" April 2012. He denied
inflating his stock on hand to cover the discrepancy, falsifying the branch

accounts and stealing any funds belonging to the Post Office Ltd.

Mr. Ishaq’s assistant, Mr. Umair Liaquat, was subsequently spoken to and
provided a statement on 24" June 2011. Mr. Ishaq was further interviewed on
27" September 2011 and indicated that Mr. Liaquat’s recollection and version
of events was inaccurate and maintained that his version of events, which he

provided in his first interview, was correct.

There was subsequently an investigation into the reversals of sales of large
quantities of stamps. Horizon data for the period of 2nd November 2010 to
31* January 2011 was obtained and examined and a summary of stock sold

and reversed was then prepared (SB/21). This shows that during the period:-

POL00057543
POL00057543
- £165.00 of sheets of 50 x 1* class large stamps were sold, but reversals
amounting to £4290 were made;

- £535.50 of sheets of 50 x 2"! class large stamps were sold, but reversals
amounting to £4,080.00 were made;

- £1,271.00 of sheets of 100 self adhesive first class stamps were sold, but
reversals of £6,068.00 were made;

- £864.00 of sheets of 100 self adhesive second class stamps were sold,

but reversals of £3,200 were made.

All of these transactions with the exception of the ones which took place on
24'" November 2010 were conducted by user KISO01 or KIS002 i.e. Khayyam
Ishaq. The transactions on 24" November were under the user ID ULI001. Mr.
Liaquat has said in his statement of 24" June 2011 that he told Mr. Ishaq his

new password whenever he was prompted to change it.

As a result of the inflated stock levels, less money would be needed to
achieve a balance and discrepancies in the cash on hand hidden. However,
had Mr. Liaquat been responsible for inflating the stock levels on 24"
November, a Wednesday, Mr. Ishaq would have noticed a significant surplus
of nearly £3000.00 effectively putting him on notice that something untoward

had happened.

It is also of note that the Branch Trading Statements TP06 (SB7) to TP09
(SB10) show an increase in volume of self adhesive 2™ class x 100 stamps
from 137 sheets to 407 sheets on hand.

2. Defence Case.

Mr. Ishaq has denied any wrongdoing in his interviews under caution and he

has maintained that Mr. Liaquat’s recollection was inaccurate. It must

POL00057543
POL00057543
therefore be assumed that Mr. Ishaq is unlikely to readily admit any

wrongdoing or the full extent of his offending.

3. Statements.

I have seen a statement from Umair Liaquat of 24" June 2011.

Statements should be taken from:-

Denis Watson and Kath Smith - dealing with the visit to the Birkenshaw
Post Office branch on 8" February 2011, their findings, the conversations with
Mr. Ishaq and Julie Crampton at the Remittance Team at P&BA Chesterfield.
According to the audit report Mr. Ishaq said that he had no knowledge of any

sales being reversed.

Stephen Bradshaw - dealing with the interviews and exhibiting the

transcripts.

Stephen Bradshaw should also exhibit to his statement and explain the
documents shown in Mr. Ishaq’s interviews and the summary of stock
sold/reversed (SB/21). He should explain in layman’s terms how the
Horizon system works, that data can be examined on a read-only basis and
how the information contained in the summary has been obtained. The
statement should also explain that as a result of the transactions, less money
would be required on hand in the branch to balance etc. Of course, any
observations with regard to the sequential Branch Trading Statements should
also be included and any records relating to holiday or sickness substitution
exhibited. There may also be relevant ONCH records which will assist with

the prosecution.

POL00057543
POL00057543
Finally, documentary evidence should be provided by way of confirmation
that Mr. Ishaq had two user ID numbers, KISO01 or KIS002, and that Mr.
Liaquat had only one ULIO01.

4. Discussion.

Mr. Ishaq was the sub postmaster and he was responsible for safeguarding
the assets of the Post Office. However there is strong evidence to suggest that
he inflated the stock on hand to reduce the amount of cash required to
achieve a balance, thereby concealing a deficit in the accounts. He must
therefore have been aware of and responsible for the deficit and in those
circumstances I am of the opinion that he should be charged with an offence

of theft.

Courts generally do not like theft and false accounting charges to be charged
in tandem for the same course of conduct. (R v Eden 55 Cr. App.R. 193 CA -
Archbold 21-238)

5. Proposed charge.

After the requisite statements have been obtained Mr. Ishaq should be
charged with an offence of theft between the 14"* September 2010 and the 9""
February 2011. Please check, however, that the dates in the charges are wide

enough to cover his offending. The draft charge can be found herewith.
