Hi Andy

As I mentioned briefly I agree this is more a language point but I will pick up with Alison when she's back from
holiday.

Here is the question and answer that went to Alison:

Q. Could branches dispute discrepancies with NBSC, or was it limited to asking for assistance to identify the cause of a
discrepancy? If NBSC could not identify the cause of a discrepancy, could the branch raise a dispute?

A. they seek assistance in resolving the discrepancy, we would not take up a dispute for a discrepancy but if settled
centrally and they believed a TC was due for a product when we call branches for payment we would investigate with the
product team to establish if there was an open items and put the debt on hold, If we had an open item we would then
issue the TC and they are able to Settle Centrally to offset the debt, if there was no open item they we wouid advise and
request payment.

I think this might be down to the language used.

Once a shortfall is "made good” in branch, there is nothing that can be “disputed” in the sense that a payment is put on
hold. This is because the "make good" process immediately results in money being put into the branch accounts and so
there is nothing that can be put on hold. So in that sense, a SPM cannot “dispute” a shortfall of less than £150.

in a broader sense however they can get NBSC / FSC to investigate any shortfall and this might generate a TC to offset
the shortfall. This is effectively “disputing” the shortfall, albeit after it has been made good.

I think that Alison's understanding probably reflects the Cs view of the word "dispute". They understand “dispute” to mean
"I don't have to pay now" which is not correct for iosses under £150.

fll speak to Counsei about making sure we are precise in the use of our language.

This supports what I always thought - if a SPMR gets to the end of the trading period and has a shortfall of less than £150,

they must make it good in order to roll over. They then contact NBSC to raise a compiaint about the shortfall, which is
then investigated and, if appropriate, a TC is generated in a later TP creating an offsetting gain.

POL-0038614
POL00042132
POL00042132

So in effect, for genera! branch losses under £150, it is "pay now, argue later". And if the SPMR is right to dispute, then
they get the money back later.

Asimilar system applies for TCs under £150 which cannot be resoived during the same trading period. The TC must be
accepted before roil over, thus creating a joss that must be made good (because it is for less than £150). The SPMR can
contact the named person on the TC (or NBSC who will put them in contact with the right person) to raise a dispute. That
may then generate a further offsetting TC if the dispute was found to be vaiid.

Correct?

Hi all

The info on the earlier question about the entry level for raising a dispute. Kath's view supports mine that we
would and do investigate losses less than £150.

I'll pick up with Alison Bolsover when she returns from leave to understand what documentation/policy she is
referencing.

Hi Angela

I have looked through the dispute process info I have and have also contacted Paul Smith from FSC - see
email chain below

POL-0038614
POL00042132
POL00042132

« Essentially, the only reference to £150 that I (and Paul) are aware of is the ability to settle
centrally limit

e The attached Accounting Losses Policy (2003) refers to at Section 3 (extract below) £150
(community) and £400 (commercial) on authority to hold losses in suspense, but no reference to
being unable to dispute threshold and cant see this in a later version 2005/2006 (3' attachment)

e Attachment - (dispute process) this was in 2008 (according to email that it was attached in sent to
Andy P from Andy W on 11/04/2013). The appeal process part doesn’t refer to £150 limit either

e SSRT has investigated less amounts <£150 and over the years in various roles I can’t ever
remember telling a Pmr that they could not dispute rather the opposite that we would support

Below is from Accounting Policy for Agency Branches (2003)
SECTION 3 - AUTHORITY TO HOLD LOSSES

Where authority is given, it will only be provided for the amount of loss discovered above a threshold amount (£150 for
those in the community segment and £400 for those in the commercial segment) and providing that no other losses are
held in suspense at the time. A unique reference number will be allocated to any authority, which the agent should note
for audit purposes.

Hi Kath,

The only thing that I know of that is £150 related js the ability to settle centrally. Maybe the query is thinking about the
fact it can’t be settle centrally and blocked while disputed so the branch has to take the cash loss at the time.

Hi Paul

Thanks for helping, I have gone through these and what I had already and can’t so far see that there is anything that
mentions anything under £150 can’t be disputed? (which is a further query from AVB)

l was of the opinion {irrespective of the limit prior to settling centrally) that a loss below this threshold could be
investigated? I know we have in SSRT

can see reference to limits of £150 & £400 in some older Losses Policy for authority to hold losses but nothing about
can’t be disputed

The attached from Andy Winn refers to the Appeal Process for a TC/BD ~but doesn’t refer to a threshold being >£150

Would FSC block a debt and/or investigate for <£150?
