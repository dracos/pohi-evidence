Tom

I did do a letter to Fujitsu (copy attached). We sent this to the P.O to forward to Fujitsu. The
last line states that Mr Castleton’s solicitors have applied for Judgment against the Post Office. Provided
that you don't mind HJ knowing this, then I am happy for you to release it.

I suspect the reason they're asking for it is Fujitsu told the P.O that it wasn't clear what the lawyers
dealing with the Torquay case were asking for. However, HJ cannot just use our letter as a template
because they will need to tailor it to their own particular factual matrix.

Thanks. Stephen

Please see attached. Did you do a letter to Fujitsu and if so is it one you would release to HJ?

Cheers
