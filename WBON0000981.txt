Dear Sirs

Alan Bates and 90 others v. Post Office Limited
Claim number: HQ16X01238

We act for Post Office Limited in relation to the above proceedings.

As part of the Court rules governing proceedings in England, parties have certain duties to preserve
documents within their possession or control. The definition of documents extends to practically all
recorded information in any format and on any medium. The concept of control can extend beyond the
parties to the proceedings to other organisations who work for a party to the proceedings.

Fujitsu, as the supplier of the Horizon system to Post Office, may hold documents that are relevant to the
above proceedings as the Claim Form (enclosed) specifically cites alleged problems with the Horizon
system.

We therefore should be grateful if you would preserve any and all documents within your position or
control in relation to Post Office and / or the Horizon system. In particular:

1. We understand that a litigation hold has been placed on Horizon transaction data for around the
last two years. Please confirm that this preservation of the Horizon transaction data will continue
until such time as Post Office authorises the data to be purged.

2. Please confirm that Fujitsu will being preserving all other Horizon data such as event logs.

3. Please ensure that all Horizon documentation such as specifications, work descriptions, change
orders, manuals, internal operational guidance, etc is preserved.

4. Please also preserve the full email accounts of any key individuals at Fujitsu who work closely
with Post Office and / or Horizon.

If any of the above matters causes you significant difficulty to implement, please do contact our Andy

Parsons! GRO I or andrew.parsong 0 discuss what action may be taken.

Yours faithfully
