1s Introduction

This document forms part of the ICL Pathway Customer Service Quality Management
System. It provides a top-level process view of the ICL Pathway CS business and
partitions the CS business into a number of process areas. Decomposition (drill-
down) to lower-level processes is applied selectively. Cross-reference is made to
other more detailed process definitions.

Within this document, processes that fall within the scope of the CS business are
shown as “white boxes”. Processes that are outside the scope of the CS business are
shown as “grey boxes”.

This document will be reviewed and updated periodically (at least twice each year) at
the discretion of the ICL Pathway CS Business Effectiveness Manager. A CP will not
be required. Free-standing CS Process Manual Supplements will be used to record
any significant process changes that occur in the periods between reviews of this
document. This means that the “current status” of ICL Pathway CS processes, at any
point in time, will equate to the CS Process Manual plus relevant supplements.
Supplements will be incorporated within the CS Process Manual at the time of the
periodic review and update.

The layout of this document has been designed to enable revisions to be easily
incorporated, e.g. tables are used to define inputs and outputs, thereby enabling the
process diagrams to remain relatively stable.

Scope

The scope of this document includes the processes associated with:
a) the operation of the ICL Pathway systems within the live environment;
b) the support of the ICL Pathway systems within the live environment;

c) ICL Pathway CS involvement in pre-defined changes, i.e. changes that do not
require a Change Request (CR) or Change Proposal (CP) to initiate the change;

d) ICL Pathway CS involvement in ad hoc changes that are initiated by a PON raised
CR or a ICL Pathway raised CP;

Note: The management of CRs and CPs is handled by the ICL Pathway Programme
Office and is therefore excluded from the scope of this document.

e) the proving and release of software fixes, either by fast-track or maintenance
telease;

f) the proving and release of any software changes that result from a PON raised CR
or a ICL Pathway raised CP;

g) the proving and release of any future major new software releases;

h) CS general management, e.g. organisation and resource management, planning,
financial control, business effectiveness and quality, general admin., etc.;

i) CS miscellaneous activities, e.g. ad hoc financial claim administration (included for
completeness, not expected), responding to requests for Data Protection
information (Subject Access Requests).

Operational processes

The operational processes referred to in (a) above include:

j) the operation of ICL Pathway Data Centres, including in-built software routines
and automated processes;

k) the operational interfaces between ICL Pathway and:
- Post office outlets
- PON
- PON Clients
1) the recording of changes to ICL Pathway central systems;
m) monitoring of systems by Tivoli and other system management tools;

n) software distribution via Tivoli or other means.

Support processes

The support processes referred to in (b) above include the:

0) management and resolution of live incidents;

p) management and resolution of live problems;

q) application of business continuity plans;

r) management of unresolved complaints;

s) resolution of business incidents;

t) analysis of service and performance data and the production of reports;

u) service management and review;

v) service development and the introduction of service improvements;

w) business effectiveness and quality;

x) communication between ICL Pathway and PON on customer service matters;

y) the handling of miscellaneous requests and claims.

Change processes

Pre-defined change
The pre-defined change processes referred to in (c) above include:
z) product reference data changes;

aa) outlet reference data changes;

bb) menu hierarchy changes when a CR or CP is not required to initiate the change

(see Ref. 1 for policy);

cc) the introduction of new Icons when a CR or CP is not required to initiate the

change (see Ref. 1 for policy);

dd) AP related change when a CR or CP is not required to initiate the change (see

Ref. 1 for policy);

ee) post office outlet changes, e.g. post office moves and closures;

Ad hoc change (CR and CP driven change)

The change processes referred to in (d) above include the CS activities that follow the

approval of a CP.

Scope exclusions

The scope specifically excludes:
ff) post office outlet roll-out and implementation processes;

gg) post office outlet training related processes;

hh) the development and maintenance of post office counter procedures and related

documentation, e.g. PPDs;

ii) the detailed activities associated with the development of software fixes and the
subsequent unit testing and link testing.

Note: The development and testing of software fixes is considered to be a service
supplied to ICL Pathway CS by ICL Pathway Development. The related CS
“Service Management” activities are included within the scope;

ji) ICL Pathway sales, requirements definition, contractual definition and
development processes associated with new software production;

kk) ICL Pathway requirements definition and implementation processes associated
with AP client migration and new AP client take-on;

ll) the administration of change associated with CRs, CPs and CCNs;
mm) the implementation of change, i.e. the raising of Change Orders;

nn) configuration management processes, e.g. the linking and provision of safe storage
for software and documentation;

00) security related processes, e.g. the management of security keys.

3 CS Process Engineering Methodology

The CS process engineering methodology uses a top-down hierarchical approach to
decompose the CS business into an integrated set of process definitions, which are
supported by policy definitions. The process definitions at the bottom of the process
hierarchy provide a framework for the development and maintenance of CS
operational procedures.

5 CS Top Level Processes

CS interacts with a number of external processes, X1 to X14 (see Table 1 for
descriptions and ownership). The CS business is considered to consist of six key
processes, CS1 to CS6 (see Table 2 for descriptions and ownership). The key inputs
and outputs to the CS processes are listed in Tables 3 and 4.

Process CS 2.1 - Manage live incident

Summary information is provided below. Ref. [2] defines the internal workings of
process CS 2.1.

Process status

Fully implemented.

Process overview

This process has well-defined links with the PON Incident Management process. ICL
Pathway CS and PON have agreed cross-domain procedures which facilitate the
transfer of incidents between the two organisations.

Incidents are raised by the HSH in response to valid telephone calls. Some ICL
Pathway CS or ICL Pathway CS supplier organisations can raise incidents directly on
the HSH systems without needing to use the telephone. Incidents are resolved by the
HSH or routed to the appropriate expert domain. Appropriate incidents are transferred
between the PON help desk (the NBSC) and the ICL Pathway help desk (the HSH) in
both directions. Some incidents may result in a software fix, which if urgent is
released to the live environment by the fast-track release process. Otherwise, the fix is
deferred to a future software release.

TPs may be used to contain a situation while a fix is developed and implemented.
TPs that affect the PON business processes are authorised via Problem Management.

Service data is provided by the incident management process to facilitate analysis and
reporting.

The incident management process provides triggers to Problem Management,
Business Continuity Management, Unresolved Complaint Management and Business
Incident Resolution.

Difficulties in resolving incidents may be escalated up the HSH management chain or
the expert domain management chain.

7.1.4 Process records
PowerHelp records. Live PinICL records.
All incidents are given an unique reference and recorded on a central database
(PowerHelp), which is maintained by the HSH and updated as incident resolution is

progressed. Incidents that are transferred between the ICL Pathway help desk (HSH)
and the PON help desk (NBSC) are cross-referred.

Incidents that require the involvement of third-line software support (SSC) are copied
to a database maintained by ICL Pathway (PinICL). Records on PinICL are cross-
referred to the original PowerHelp incident reference, i.e. the two systems are locked
together.

7.1.5 Process measures

SLAs that relate to the time to resolve incidents.

The contract between ICL Pathway and PON includes a number of SLAs. The
performance of the incident management process is monitored on an ongoing basis
using the SLAs as measures. Non-conformance against SLAs is reported to ICL
Pathway CS Management and relevant service reviews.

Summary information is provided below. Ref. [3] defines the internal workings of

Process status

Fully implemented.

Process overview

This process has well-defined links with the PON Problem Management process. ICL
Pathway CS and PON have agreed cross-domain procedures which facilitate the
notification of problems between the two organisations.

This process receives problem notifications from ICL Pathway CS organisations,
specified ICL Pathway CS supplier organisations and PON Problem Managers.
Problems are recorded on a ICL Pathway CS maintained database and progressed to
resolution under the direction of the Problem Manager.

Problems that affect both ICL Pathway CS and PON are referred to as “cross-domain
problems”. Cross-domain problems that are notified to ICL Pathway CS by PON are
added to the ICL Pathway CS database and cross-referred to the PON problem
reference. PON operate a similar approach for cross-domain problems notified by
ICL Pathway CS.

Process CS 2.2 also handles the authorisation of TPs that affect the PON business
processes and when appropriate raises a draft CP to progress problem resolution.

Difficulties in resolving problems may be escalated up the ICL Pathway CS
management chain and, if necessary, to other ICL Pathway or PON authorities.

Process overview

This process has well-defined links with the PON Business Continuity Management
process. ICL Pathway CS and PON have agreed cross-domain procedures which
facilitate the notification of MBCIs between the two organisations

Process CS 2.3 applies approved and tested business continuity plans in response to
notified MBCIs. If plans are not available, e.g. because an unexpected event has
occurred, the ICL Pathway CS Business Continuity Manager convenes necessary
meetings to agree a way forward. Problems are raised if an underlying cause is
suspected.

Difficulties in resolving MBCIs may be escalated up the ICL Pathway CS
management chain and, if necessary, to other ICL Pathway and / or PON authorities.

Process records

MBCI records. MBCIs that occur in the live environment are given an unique
reference and recorded on a central database, which is maintained by ICL Pathway
cs.

Process measures

Summary information is provided below. Ref. [5] defines the internal workings of
process CS 2.4.

7.4.1 Process status

Recently introduced.

7.4.2 Process overview

Wherever possible, complaints that are received via the telephone, to either the PON
help desk (the NBSC) or the ICL Pathway help desk (the HSH), are resolved within
incident management (process CS 2.1), i.e. incident raised, complaint addressed,
incident closed.

Complaints that cannot be resolved by the HSH are passed to process CS 2.4. In
addition, (a) complaints received by the NBSC that require a response from ICL
Pathway, are passed to process CS 2.4 and (b) all written complaints received by ICL
Pathway CS or its suppliers are passed to CS 2.4.

Process CS 2.4 resolves complaints. A problem is raised if an underlying cause is
suspected. Complaints are escalated within ICL Pathway CS if they cannot be
resolved in a timely manner. If a complaint cannot be resolved by ICL Pathway CS it
is escalated to a higher authority.

7.5.1 Process status

Establish with improvements under review.

7.5.2 Process overview

The resolution of business incidents is tightly linked to the ICL Pathway CS incident
management (process CS 2.1). Process CS 2.1 passes business incidents (a special
type of incident) to process CS 2.5, where they are resolved. A special report (BIMS
report) is used to notify PON on the progress, clearance and closure of business
incident resolution.

A problem is raised if an underlying cause is suspected.

Some business incidents may have financial implications, i.e. necessitate a payment to

PON

7.7.2 Process overview

Reviews are held for each of the key services provided by ICL Pathway CS. The
reviews are supported by reports, information and statistics provided by process CS
2.6. Other ICL Pathway CS processes and / or PON processes may provide specialist
reports to service reviews, e.g. CS3 - Manage pre-defined change (reference data).

Service reviews have an allocated chairman who prepares an agenda and produces
minutes. Actions are allocated at service reviews and reviewed at subsequent reviews.
Some service reviews include additional activities, e.g. agreement of business incident
closure.

Attendees at customer focused service reviews include relevant people from ICL
Pathway CS and PON. Attendees at supplier focused service reviews include relevant
people from ICL Pathway CS and supplier organisations.

Service reviews may identify suspected problems or service improvement
opportunities.

7.9.1 Process status

Some aspects implemented. Others under development, e.g. process auditing, pre-live

7.9.2 Process overview

The management of business effectiveness includes the production and maintenance
of process and policy definitions. These provide a framework for the development
and maintenance of ICL Pathway CS operational procedures.

In addition, where appropriate, “standalone” process and policy definitions are
produced to support problem management and / or service improvement activities.

Process CS 2.9 also acts as a link with ICL Pathway Development for the
communication of “pre-live problems” that are discovered during the development of
system architecture or new software.

It is planned to add a process auditing service in the future, which can be “called-off”
when required. This will provide additional inputs into problem management and
service improvement.

(d) interactions associated with the delivery or non-delivery of electronic messages to

post office outlets.

Wherever possible, a “single-point-of-contact” will be used at the interface between

ICL Pathway CS and PON.

The  single-point-of-contact will communicate with relevant ICL Pathway

organisations to:
(a) obtain information for onward routing to PON;

(b) distribute information received from PON;

(c) trigger charging associated with the delivery of electronic messages to post office

7.11 Process CS 2.11 - Manage miscellaneous requests or

claims

7.11.1 Process status

Process agreed in principle but has never needed to be used. Process definition under

review.

7.11.2 Process overview

This process is included for completeness and handles any ad hoc claims or queries.
None are expected but the following two possible situations have been identified.

(a) PON could submit an ad hoc financial claim, which would probably require

investigation and a commercial decision.

(b) Members of the public could make a “subject access request” a component of the

data protection act.

Process status

Fully established.

Process overview

Reference data falls into two main groups, i.e. product and outlet. This section
considers product reference data. Changes to product reference data are considered to
be Operational Business Changes and as such do not require a CR to be raised by
PON.

Product reference data changes may be basic or advance. Advance change relates to
situations where ICL Pathway needs to perform some activities before the product
reference data is implemented, e.g. the introduction of a new product, which needs a
new button. Basic change relates to situations where ICL Pathway CS can implement
the change without prior notice.

Advance change is notified to ICL Pathway CS via an OBC form. This triggers the
activities that need to be carried out before the reference data is released to live.
Advance change is verified and authorised by PON before release.

Basic changes may be pure or high risk. Pure data has a low potential impact on the
PON business and is therefore released to the live environment without PON
verification.

High risk changes have the potential to significantly impact the PON business if there
are errors. Therefore, high risk data is verified and authorised by PON before release

to the live environment. Any errors that are identified during verification are recorded
and resolved in conjunction with PON reference data authorities.

During the verification of high risk data PON has the option to set an “alert flag”. The
ICL Pathway CS RDT monitor reference data files more closely if the alert flag is set.
The RDT alerts PON if: (a) the data is scheduled for distribution the night before “the
reference data start date” AND (b) system difficulties prevent the data being
distributed. Sending the data out the night before it goes live is exceptional but this

could occur if PON provided the reference data late.

Reference data is normally

distributed well before the reference data start date, which in normal circumstances
provides contingency against system difficulties.

Summary information is provided below. [Ref. 7] provides additional information
relating to changes to outlet reference data.

Process status
Fully established.

Process overview

Reference data falls into two main groups, i.e. product and outlet. This section
considers outlet reference data. Changes to outlet reference data are considered to be
Operational Business Changes and as such do not require a CR to be raised by PON.

Outlet reference data changes may be basic or advance. Advance outlet change
involves physical changes in post office outlets, e.g. post office move (see section on
post office outlet change for further information). The timing of the physical change
and the reference data are linked.

There are two types of electronic outlet reference data. Outlet and Help Desk. The
outlet reference data is authorised by PON before release to the live environment.
Help desk reference data is released to the live environment without authorisation.

Both outlet and help desk reference data are distributed to outlets. Distinguishing
between help desk reference data files and outlet reference data files supports the long
term strategy of linking the RDMS system with the incident management systems.

8.3 Process CS 3.3 - Manage menu hierarchy change

8.3.1 Process status

This process is currently being reviewed because it has become apparent that it is
possible for PON to request a change to the menu hierarchy via an OBC 2 form(CR
not required), which could adversely affect the theoretical counter timings and result
in ICL Pathway failing to meet its commercial obligations. In the short term ICL
Pathway Commercial will advise on which process is used. There are two choices:

(a) PON raise a CR and the menu change is treated as an ad hoc change. If this route
is chosen it is likely that the CR raised by PON would be fast-tracked and that the
CR would be impacted by the ICL Pathway CS counter timing authorities;

(b) PON relax the contractual constraints to remove the current conflict between the
PON / ICL Pathway contract and the PON / ICL Pathway operational procedures,
thereby ensuring that ICL Pathway cannot be penalised as a result of implementing
a PON requested menu hierarchy change.

8.5 Process CS 3.5 - Manage AP change

8.5.1 Process status

Process under development. Some provisional information is provided below for
completeness.

8.5.2 Process overview
This process covers the following topics:
(a) Client take-on to the PON HAPS system;
(b) Client migration from PON HAPS to ICL Pathway systems;
(c) Client take-on to ICL Pathway systems.

Reference data relating to new AP cards or bar codes (tokens) and the PAN (code on
the card or bar-code) are used to produce a test file which is sent to PON for checking
and authorisation.

In addition to the reference data associated with AP tokens and their validation, ICL
Pathway CS also manages AP Client migration and take-on. Client migration and
take-on is dependent on other ICL Pathway Directorates providing a number of
“services” to ICL Pathway CS, e.g. agreement of a Client Specification, software /
system work to facilitate the connection to the ICL Pathway systems, installation of
hardware (PC) on the Clients site.

The final stage in Client migration and take-on is the entry into the APS workstation
of the information needed to set-up file formats and connections. These activities are
performed by ICL Pathway CS.

Client take-on to the PON HAPS system

This is driven by an agreed plan. ICL Pathway CS responds to notification from PON
and make the necessary inputs to the APS workstation, which sets up file structure and
connections.

Client migration from HAPS to ICL Pathway systems

Client migration is driven by an authorised migration plan. A Client specification
provides the information needed to connect the Client. The migration plan triggers:

(a) necessary software / system related work;
(b) installation of required hardware on the Clients site;
(c) the required entries into APS Workstation to set up file structure and connection.

Client take-on to ICL Pathway systems

A Client specification provides the information needed to connect the Client. The
ICL Pathway CS “Client take-on manager” ensures that the following are carried out:

(a) necessary software / system related work;

(b) installation of required hardware on the Clients site;

overview

This process is considered to be an Operational Business Change and as such does not
require a CR to be raised by PON.

The service is chargeable. PON may request a range of changes via an OBC 20 form,

e.g. outlet move, closure, ete.

Each type of change has a standard charge.

ICL

Pathway CS requests an engineer resource via a Work Schedule. The Work Schedule
is communicate to the live environment incident management process operated by a
ICL Pathway CS supplier. The work schedule results in an OBC call being raised and
an engineer being despatched to the required outlet to effect the change.

Changing for the change is triggered via communication between ICL Pathway CS

and ICL P.

‘athway Finance.

The OBC call is not an incident, but it is convenient to think of it as such because it
uses the established incident management processes within the ICL Pathway CS
supplier organisation.

overview

This process includes various release management activities and appropriate proving
tests. Errors detected during proving tests are fed back to ICL Pathway Development
for correction. Fixes may be error-free but fall short of completely addressing the
deficiency identified on the original PinICL. Alternatively, the fix may introduce an
adverse knock-on effect. When these situations occur ICL Pathway CS will decide
whether the fix should be held pending re-work or released with its known shortfalls.
If it is decided to release the fix, ICL Pathway CS will raise a cross-referred PinICL to
address the shortfall. The cross-referred PinICL will be progressed in the normal way.
