ARETH JENKINS]

John,
Of the Branches on the sheet I passed to POL, I am aware of the following Branches that are not down to the main problem:

1. 122946: This Branch appears to have “lost” the opening figures when it migrated.

2. 113459: This doesn’t show in POL’s analysis as being the same. Also we don’t have any 902 or 903 events for this Branch, so
it looks different in my summary data

374632: This appears to be a problem with Opening Figures being lost after 60 days

May also be worth checking 148025. We have no 902 / 903 Events for this Branch, but POL analysis indicates a problem. It
could just be lost events. NB this problem was in May and so may be hard to get relevant data.

ale

Note also that POL don’t seem to have checked out all the Branches.

Regards

Gareth

Gareth,
Can you identify which from your list are actually your issue and which need further investigation by us.
I will then raise the Peaks for SSC to investigate further.

regards
John

All,

OK. This confirms that the issue with 122946 is something different.

It also suggests that 113459 has a different issue and so may need to be investigated separately. (I've just checked and
there were no 903 or 902 events from this branch, so that supports this.)

I see that they've not gone through the full list yet and in particular 374632 which I think is something different.
This means that the only Branch with a lost discrepancy over £1000 is 220222 (£7,044.66 to be exact).

Should we be opening new calls for these oddities or what? Dave Seddon has sent me a load more stuff on 374632, which
I may try and look at, but we should really have a separate Peak and follow normal process.

What next?

Regards

Gareth

Emma,

Please can you pass this on to anybody in POL who needs it. I don’t have a full list of who was on the call.

As promised on the call, I've tidied up the list of affected Branches and put them into the attached spreadsheet.
<<Affected Branches.xls>>

I've also added in a further 11 Branches that raised events as part of last week’s rollovers.

Some Branches in the list have not yet produced a BTS and so may not be aware of the problem (I’ve noted these
in Col 1).

I've also added in the absolute value of the lost discrepancy so as to produce totals in Row 56 as requested by Andy
Winn.

Summary is:
° 53 Rollovers affected
° 2 Branches appear twice in the list (in one case it may be a duplicate of one error — this needs further

investigation)

° Net total is about £41K
FUJ00081211
FUJ00081211

° Absolute total is about £46K

° Only 4 cases where amount is over £1,000

Note that in many cases the affected SU is missing from the spreadsheet. We know how to find this out, but have
not yet done so in all cases. We will clearly need to do that if we are to attempt to fix the issue in Horizon.

Gareth
