eam Tee 7

Thank you for your letter of 3 November to Peter Mandelson, on behalf of
your constituent, Mr David Bristow of Odiham Post Office, High Street,
Odiham RG29 1LA, about the Post Office Horizon system. I am replying as
Minister of State for Business, Innovation and Skills.

Under the Government's postal sector reforms introduced in 2001, Royal
Mail (which includes Post Office Ltd (POL)) was given greater commercial
freedom, as the management and unions had requested, and Government
has assumed an arm's length role as a shareholder in a public limited
company. Subject to agreeing its strategic plan with us, the Board can
structure the business as it decides best to meet the challenges of market
development and changing customer needs.

The issues raised by your constituent are operational and contractual
matters for POL and not for Government. I understand from POL that errors
at the branch have been fully investigated and there is nothing to indicate
that there are any problems with the Horizon system. The company’s
position as regards the integrity of the Horizon system remains as set out in
the reply dated 13 October from Alan Cook, Managing Director, to Brooks
Newmark MP, to which your letter refers.
