OCP 25316 Withdrawn
This OCP withdrawn 02/02/2010 19:36 because OCP timings delayed until Thursday 04-feb

Fix BTS Data for More Pilot branches (Peak
193823)

The first HNG-X Branch (Coton) attempted to balance its accounts and when producing its BTS Report an
accounting mismatch was reported. The Counter team have examined the data and have identified
problems with the way in which the BRDB In Day migration package is writing data to
BRDB_RX_BTS_DATA.

The data in BRDB_RX_BTS_DATA for all Pilot branches has to be corrected, so accounts can reconcile.
The data in Coton and Warwick barnches has been fixed. This OCP is to correct the data for the next 6
Pilot branches.

The following 6 branches will be fixed :
268246 Bristnall Fields

296246 Lapworth

401246 Brownsover

354217 Three Pots

313227 Sawley

198247 Ombersley Road

This should not be applied on LST, as the branches do not exist on LST.

Justification: To allow the Pilot branches to balance their accounts.
When: Planned for 03/02/2010 07:30 with a duration of 10 minutes
Extra detail: There will be a script for each branch, added as separate attachments to this OCP. The script

name will include the Fad_Code of the branch e.g. BDB_268246_BTS_Fix.sql LOGIN to brdb node I as
unix user brdb Sqlplus / @<script name> ; exit;

Regression: Development can provide scripts to correct any issues.. Regression will take 10 minutes.
