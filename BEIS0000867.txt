Dear Henry,

Further to your call earlier today with the Secretary of State, the Special Shareholder is
today exercising her authority under Article 42(A) of the Articles of Association of Post
Office Limited to remove you as chair of Post Office Limited. The appropriate notice will be
sent to the company secretary shortly.

Accordingly your appointment as non-executive chair of Post Office Limited will terminate
automatically with immediate effect.

Thank you for your service to the Post Office over the past year.
I wish you the best for the future.

Kind regards,

GRO

Carl Creswell
Director, Business Resilience
For and on behalf of the Secretary of State for Business and Trade
