POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY

FIRST WITNESS STATEMENT OF MATTHEW JAMES SHIELS

I, Matthew James Shiels will say as follows:

INTRODUCTION

1. I am the Compliance Officer for Legal Practice (“COLP”) and a director at
AWH Acquisition Corp Ltd t/a Cartwright King (Company No: 12450173)

(‘New CK”).

2. This witness statement is made to assist the Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry
(the “Inquiry”) with the matters set out in the Rule 9 Request dated

18/12/2023 (the “Request’).

3. On 23/12/2022, Cartwright King Limited (now called CK Realisations 2022
Limited, company no: 10143062) (“Old CK”), was put into administration
and certain assets of Old CK were purchased by New CK (the

“Acquisition”).

WITN11150100

4. The senior management of Old CK were not involved in the purchase of the
assets by New CK and were not retained by New CK post-Acquisition.
Additionally, none of the senior management of New CK had been employed

by or connected in any way with Old CK prior to the Acquisition.

5. Accordingly, none of the senior management of New CK have any firsthand
knowledge of the matters set out in the Request or indeed any of the work
conducted by Old CK on behalf of The Post Office (“PO”). I am therefore
making this statement as a corporate statement on behalf of New CK to
assist the Inquiry as far as we possibly can, given the limitations set out

above.

BACKGROUND

6. I have been asked to set out the internal structure of the private prosecutions
team [at Old CK] dealing with PO cases (prosecutions and the subsequent
review) in the period 2012 to 2015, which should include the relative seniority
of all relevant individuals during this period (including any changes) and the
structure of management. In addition, I have been asked to specifically
confirm the position of Rachel Panter, whether she was a paralegal or a

Junior Associate (and when), and who she was supervised by or reported to.

7. Asset out above, neither I nor any of the senior management team have any
firsthand knowledge of the matters set out within the request, nor are any of

the solicitors or in-house counsel who we are aware of having worked in the
Page 2 of 14
WITN11150100
WITN11150100

private prosecutions team at Old CK presently in the employ of New CK, all
but one of whom having left prior to the Acquisition and the one remaining

solicitor, Andy Cash, having left during the course of 2023.

8. I have however been able to locate a number of historic documents which

assist my ability to respond to the Request to a certain extent. Those

documents are as follows (the descriptions that appear below represent the

names that the documents have been saved under):

a) Staff List Location & Supervision V2 March 2012 (“Staff List 1”)
(WITN11150101)

b) Copy of Staff List Location & Supervision Crime October 2014 (“Staff List
2”) (WITN11150102)

c) Staff List - Roles & Departments @ 31.10.14 (‘Staff List 3”)
(WITN11150103)

d) Staff List - Roles & Departments @ 12.1.15 (‘Staff List 4”)
(WITN11150104)

e) CK Admin Roles & Management Chart (“Chart 1”) (WITN11150105)

f) CK Admin Roles & Management Chart 07.10.14 (“Chart 2”)
(WITN11150106)

g) Operational Director — Role Specifics (‘OD Spec”) (WITN11150107)

h) Copy of Staff Reporting List — crime (“Reporting 1”) (WITN11150108)

i) Staff Reporting List (“Reporting 2”) (WITN11150109)

j) Staff Reporting List @ 14.05.15 ("Reporting 3") (WITN11150110)

9. Whilst these documents do go some way to identifying management and

Page 3 of 14
WITN11150100
WITN11150100

supervision structures that were in place at Old CK during the period from
2012 to 2015, one key question that the documents do not provide an answer
to is the identity of the individuals who made up the private prosecutions

team.

10.In the circumstances I have focused my interrogation of the documents on
the individuals identified by Andrew Bolc, during his evidence to the Inquiry
on 15/12/2023, as being members of the private prosecutions team, namely,
Andy Cash, Martin Smith, Andrew Bolc, Simon Clarke, Harry Bowyer and

Rachel Panter.

STAFF LISTS 1,2,3 &4

11. Staff List 1 (WITN11150101) comprises a list of Old CK Staff by department,
with additional columns detailing the grade, office, qualifications, supervisors
and resident directors for each member of staff/department. The departments
are listed as Nottingham Crime, Leicester Crime, Derby Crime, Business
Defence, Immigration, Mental Health, Higher Courts, Child Care/Family and

Administration.

12. Staff List 2 (WITN11150102) appears to be an updated version of Staff List
14, but only includes members of the various crime departments. In addition
to the departments listed in Staff List 1, there are Birmingham Crime,

Sheffield Crime, Chambers and Milton Keynes Crime.

columns detailing the title, start date and admission date for each member of
staff. The title column includes the letters A, SA and D against certain
members of staff. Whilst there is no Key to define these titles, I have worked
on the basis that the titles are Associate, Senior Associate and Director. The
departments remain as with Staff List 3, but with the addition of Employment.
Crime Unlimited is however further defined as Crime Unlimited (Crime,

HCA/Crown Court/Business Defence/Motoring/Road Haulage etc).
