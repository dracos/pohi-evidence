Subject: Final thoughts

Paula

You asked me for a few closing thoughts, here they are, nothing radical.

The primary focus has to be proving to JFSA and MPs that we can take on the role of
independently investigating cases. That way we can start to bring things under our control. Our
plan to do this is to augment Second Sight with POL resources, build up or credibility, and then,
at the right time, remove Second Sight.

This strategy almost entirely falls on Angela’s shoulders. She will be heading the investigations
(with POL support) and on a daily basis interacting with SS and JFSA. If for whatever reason
JFSA or SS lose confidence in her independence or capability the strategy is blown apart.

I have a couple recommendations:

1. 1.We supplement Angela’s team with an external forensic accountant. Ideally, from one of
the big consultancies. This would give Angela additional capacity, an independent perspective to
challenge her and could give her credibility if she needs to take a counter position against SS ina
particular investigation.

2. 2. We need to keep an informal channel open to Alan, to get early signs of any problems.
Maybe a confidential monthly call with you — just to check the temperature?

In terms of the rest of the team, they are making satisfactory progress. I was becoming concerned
by the slowness of the communications team to engage MPs — so maybe something to keep an
eye on in the next few weeks.

That's it. I am confident it will succeed but am sure there will continue to be bumps along the way.

All the best to you, Paula. Thanks for your leadership, your support, your openness, and your
encouragement.

Kind Regards, Simon
