4. ~ End to End Business Continuity

Overall there are no major threats to business continuity, however there are still growing
concems regarding the continuation of lost transactions, it was anticipated that lost
transactions would decline after the software fix dated 16 February 1998.

Continuation of this trend will seriously undermine the credibility of the system.

NB: This section of the report should be interpreted in respect of the perception of the ‘end user’ and how
it will impact their environment.

5.1 Infrastructure

Post Office Relocations/Refurbishments

Following the PIR for the recent relocations and refurbishments an interim process has
been verbally agreed between POCL and ICL Pathway, for the duration of Release Ic.
A formal process cannot be drafted until POCL states it’s requirement, this is not
envisaged until Release 2 when the ‘change catalogue’ is produced.

A number of actions were assigned at the meeting for subsequent feedback at an update
meeting scheduled for early April.

5.2 Benefit Payment System

Lost Transactions

ICL Pathway are continuing their investigation concerning the four categories of lost transactions
identified in the last interim report. The objective is to ascertain the root cause at the POCL
customer interface. Service Management has escalated the aforementioned problems to Product
Management for action to facilitate a solution within the ICL Pathway domain.

5.3. Accounting & Reconciliation
Appendix ‘A’ details an agreed summary of accounting & reconciliation for the
February period.

6. BES: Volumetrics
Definitions for the purpose of this report.
A transaction is a broad description of a customer session. (the term ‘transaction’ is
more rigorously defined in the contract).
A payment is the Child Benefit allowance money due for one week, or for four weeks (
in case of a four- weekly allowance).
An encashment is a measure of the work effort in a customer session from the clerk
accepting the payment card to returning the card with monies, i.e. one customer is paid
all due Child Benefit allowance. Thus, a customer may save several payments before
visiting their PO. During such a transaction there will be one encashment of several
payments.
