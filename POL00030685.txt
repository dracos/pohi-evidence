who are believed to have interfered with postal packets
(s83 of the Postal Services Act 2000).

.3. In Scotland the Procurator Fiscal’s office will make all prosecution

decisions on Royal Mail investigations.

+4, In Northern Ireland the office of the Director of the Public

Prosecution Service will make all prosecution decisions on Royal Mail
investigations.

-5. It is a requirement of the Royal Mail Group Conduct Code, fully

outlined in paragraph 8.3 of the Royal Mail Group Crime and
Investigation Policy that in reaching decisions on conduct code
actions the Human Resources Director or his or her representative
must liaise with those handling any criminal investigation or
prosecution. In the event of any disagreement with prosecution
advice in England and Wales, or inconsistency between prosecution and
conduct decisions anywhere in the United Kingdom, the Head of the
Criminal Law Team and the Head of the Investigation Team will
consider the case and provide guidance and advice to ensure that
Royal Mail maintains a consistent prosecution policy

Test for Prosecution and Public Interest

6.1. The decision to prosecute will be reached by applying the general

principles and guidance offered by ‘The Code for Crown Prosecutors’,
in particular ‘The Full Code Test’.

-2. ‘The Full Code Test’ will be applied and adhered to before commencing

a criminal prosecution. The ‘Test’ has two stages. If the evidence
passes the evidential stage, the Prosecutor must proceed to the
second stage and decide if a prosecution is needed in the public
interest. A prosecution will be required if it is in the public
interest to do so.

.3. Where a criminal investigation identifies an employee’s behaviour

that falls short of requiring a criminal prosecution the employee
will normally be subject to the conduct code process.
