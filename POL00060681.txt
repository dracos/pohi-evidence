Subject

MISRA case
- Def pleaded not guilty to theft (but pleaded guilty to FA)
- Def produced computer expert to argue Horizon issues
PO used Fujitsu expert to argue Horizon issues
- Outcome — found guilty by jury of theft after a 7 day trial
- Evidence relied to convict ~
© She alleged it was either Horizon computer or her employees
o She said after she had got rid of employees the losses got worse
Therefore she blamed Horizon (at a late stage in the proceedings ~ after it was listed for trial ~ so this
trial got adjourned whilst each side got Horizon evidence together)
o it was a jury trial — so no explanation as to what evidence was relied on by them re conviction

Hugh,
Looking at the stats, one theft case was found guilty after pleading not guilty. What evidence was relied on to convict?

FSA case intel to follow *

Legally privileged and confidential

MP cases first:
What we need in particular, and very urgently, is a breakdown of the 47 cases showing:

1. How many of the SPMs had their contracts terminated?

AWAITING INTEL

2. How many of the SPMs were convicted of respectively, fraud, theft and false accounting?

Theft -3
Fraud -2
False Accounting ~ 4

(Note - 2 CASES where we haven't yet been able to confirm the charge)

3. In each category, how many of those convicted pled guilty?

Th-2
Fr-2
Fa-4

4. How many (if any) were prosecuted but found not quilty?

1 (we ended up offering no evidence and where the defendant paid back the sums)
Note:

- On Rudkin, husband NOT prosecuted but wife was prosecuted and convicted.

- On Watson, we gave no evidence against her but the husband was prosecuted and pleaded guilty
