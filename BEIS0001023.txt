Attachment: 20240130 Advisory Board paper on speeding compensation KH comments.docx
Hi Rob,

Thanks for the slightly impromptu meeting with the minister just now. On the sub he has
reviewed and commented the following:

+ I'd like to see how we calculated Alan Bates’ compensation please? Even a
ready reckoner of £50k/year for 18 years plus interest seems to be considerably
in excess of the offer we made. Not sure we aren't making this all too
complicated/getting into the weeds too much at times.

+ The £450k interim on receipt of a full claim is a good idea, we should do the
same for the GLO, say £50k?

+ Why does it take 30 weeks to respond to a late HSS claim?

+ I think we need an appeal mechanism in addition to the HSS FSA. I think we
should consult the HCAB before implementing either.

* Please can I have a table showing a comparison of tariffs for non-pecuniary
OC vHSS

Comments on individual proposals in the attached.

He has also expressed to me that he'd like the detail behind a number of high-profile
claims. For example, Jo Hamilton claims that her original offer went from 20% of her
original claim to 80%, why is that? Christopher Head's was only 15% of what he
claimed, why? And obviously, as referenced above, Alan Bates' claim. I understand
there's a note already being drafted on this?

v best,

Jamie

The Minister is meeting the Advisory Board plus Ross Cranston and Gary Hickinbottom on 22
February. That meeting is to consider a paper with recommendations from the Board on how we can
speed up Horizon compensation.

To help the Board with this I’m preparing a paper which describes the current status of the
compensation schemes, identifies the areas where there is (and is not) an issue about pace, and
identifies a long-list of possible proposals. In finalising the paper for 22 Feb I envisage that the Board
will want to slim down that long-list — and no doubt add other items to it.

I attach a working draft of the paper. The Board hasn’t yet seen it, but it reflects ideas which they've
been discussing in correspondence as well as some from other sources. The long-list highlights in
yellow the options which officials would recommend, although of course the Board will take their
own view.

All this is very much in draft. Many of the numbers need checking — they will anyway be updated in
the light of our monthly stats update, due next week.

I'd welcome any ideas which the Minister would add to the long-list and any which he would prefer
us not to suggest to the Board (although they may add them back of their own accord).

The long-list refers to the £75k fixed offer on HSS. I understand that the proposal has been accepted
by CST but No 10 did not want to pursue it. I don’t want to expose that to the Board, so it’s labelled
“Pursue subject to wider agreement”.

I’m planning to put the draft to the Board early next week. Grateful for any comments in advance of
that.
