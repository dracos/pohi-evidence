Paul,

The precautionary suspension notification has not come through so please can you revert to the manual system.

I have authorised the precautionary suspension proforma but have change the content of the section headed ‘reasons
for precautionary suspension’ as the comments did not make sense to me ~— please make any additional comments

required.

lalso think this is the old format of the precautionary suspension proforma and you may want to look the latest version
out for the next time you have to complete one of these documents.

One I receive the suspension notification email I will allocate to you initially to start the case and then we can look to
moving the case to Robert.

Thanks
John

Hi John

Thave just completed the suspension notification via Sharepoint but can’t tell if this has worked so can you let me know if
you have received an email notification via this method. If not I will go back to the “medieval” system.

Please see attached the form I prepared today.
Regards

Paul
