Trent,

In accordance with the CCRC’s s.17 Criminal Appeal Act 1995 notice dated 13 December 2018, please find attached
the expert reports of Dr Worden (for Post Office) and Mr Coyne (for the Claimants), filed for the “Horizon Issues”
trial in the Post Office Group Litigation.

As with the other material we have provided in connection with the “Post Office / Horizon cases — CCRC review”,
please treat these reports as confidential and, in accordance with s.25 Criminal Appeal Act 1995, do not disclose
them or any part of them without Post Office Limited’s prior consent (you may be aware that expert reports filed in
civil litigation are confidential until such time as the experts are sworn in by the Court to give their evidence).

Kind regards, Rodric

Trent,
My apologies, but we have been having very long days dealing with the Post Office Group Litigation Common

Issues trial (the hearing of which concludes today), while also progressing matters for that litigation’s Horizon
Issues trial, most notably the delivery of Post Office Limited’s expert’s report. As you rightly note, that report was

POL-0038686
POL00042204
POL00042204

due to be filed and served on 30 November 2018, but will now by agreed extension be filed and served on Friday 7
December 2018.

We appreciate the interest that the CCRC has in the expert reports filed for the Horizon Issues trial. We are also
conscious that those reports have been prepared pursuant to orders made by the Managing Judge in the Group
Litigation, for the specific purpose of assisting him to determine at a trial in March 2019 issues concerning the
Horizon system, as part of the overall resolution of the Group Litigation. We trust you will understand that we do
not wish to do anything improper which might conflict with the Court’s processes.

So that we can proceed appropriately, could I please ask you send to Post Office Limited (marked for my attention)
a Section 17 Notice for the expert reports filed in the Post Office Group Litigation (Bates & Others v. Post Office
Limited, Claim No. HQ16X01238, HQ17X02637 and HQ17X04248) by:

- Jason Coyne, for the Claimants, filed on 16 October 2018; and

- Dr Robert Worden, for the Defendant, to be filed on 7 December 2018.

These can be sent to me by email if that is easier. I hope that is clear, but please let me know if you require or wish
to discuss anything further.

Kind regards, Rodric

Morning Rodric,

Can I ask whether there is any progress on the below matters please? In your last email you indicated that you
were about to send something, but I don’t think I received?

1am conscious that both expert reports for the Horizon trial will now have been served. Our Commissioners are
meeting to consider the criminal cases soon, so it would be useful if we could consider the reports as soon as
possible.

Kind regards,
Miles

I have been tied up in court with the Group Litigation Common Issues Trial, but aim to send you something

I hope that's OK. I apologise for any inconvenience.
