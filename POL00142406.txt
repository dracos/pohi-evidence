Belinda,

As discussed, please find enclosed the details requested regarding the incident in March 2010.

Background:

HNGX was being piloted early in 2010 and was deployed to a limited amount of branches. In March of 2010, an issue
was reported by a sub-postmaster that resulted in a duplicate transaction being generated when the application
went off line unexpectedly.

When the transaction correction tool is used as described below, it is completed in a unique auditable event is
captured in the audit trail and can be searched for in the audit archive. Only 1 event of this nature has been

identified from scanning all records since go live of HNGX.

The following timeline summarises the event.

2/3/2010: Error Occurs

While the Post Master was performing a cash transfer Horizon went offline unexpectedly. Horizon automatically
detected the failure and included a warning on the receipt that the results of this session would need to be checked
by the Sub Post-Master. The Sub Post-Master duly checked and discovered the transfer had been doubled.

Helpdesk call raised by Sub- Post Master and sent to Fujitsu software support team for investigation

started, Sub-postmaster informed of progress.

negate the duplicate transaction

Fujitsu software support checked the summarised accounts (produced overnight) for this branch to confirm that the
correction had been propagated correctly through the system.

Work round to correct accounts confirmed as complete.

04/04/2010: Root ca esolution
The problem was caused by a rare combination of circumstances that occurred in the early pilot phase for HNGX. A
code fix was made to remedy the root cause and implemented across HNGX via the BAU process.

Any questions, please advise.
