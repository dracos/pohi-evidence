Hi lan,

I understand perfectly. I think I ought to talk to James about this when he gets back next week, and it may be
that he will need to have a chat.

In the end, beyond the results of the thematic investigations, what will individuals get back from the
investigations? Their expectation and desire will be to have their innocence proved, or a clear explanation of
what has gone on that offers ‘closure’ (dreadful word) on their experience as Post Office employees. If this is
NOT what is going to happen, then James will need to think through how to present this to the MPs.

Anyway, leave this with me, and Ill come back to you both next week.

All the very best
Janet
