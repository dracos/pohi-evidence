John
I've had a discussion with Gareth.

It was agreed during the meeting between Gareth and Charles that Charles would provide notes reflecting the
discussion; Gareth has not yet received these.

His views on the email string are:-

1. Access to system in Midlands: This was not something we discussed in detail. It would appear that
Charles is aware of a Post Office which is having issues similar to those which have resulted in
prosecution, but that there are currently no prosecutions in place. He would like to monitor exactly what
happens in this branch (probably with a video camera) and compare that with the system logs (hoping to
find a mismatch!). However the Postmaster is covered by confidentiality agreements, which mean that
this cannot be done with out permission of POL. | assume that this is a request to be able to do this. I'm
also assuming that help would be required from Fujitsu in retrieving logs from the system to compare with
the video. NB this probably needs to be done quickly before migrating to HNG-X. Charles's first report
refers-to such a branch | believe. I’ve no idea where this postmaster would stand in respect of any
problems that they have had but which are not yet visible to POL, or in respect of what they have already
said to Charles.

2. Access to Chesterfield: Charles is still of the opinion that understanding how P&BA operate and in
particular how they identify errors and process them as Transaction Corrections may help his case. I've
pointed out that anything in this area that could affect the accounts is already visible to him in the Horizon
logs and so | don't see that this is likely to be of help to him. However he would still like to pursue this line
of exploration.

3. System Change Requests: Basically, he was asking to look at all system faults. | suggested that as we
kept all testing and Live faults in the same system and that there were around 200,000 of them, then this
wasn't going to get him far. He then suggested looking at system changes and would like to see all
changes that have happened to the system. Again, | don’t think this will help and | don't know how
practical it is for Fujitsu’s Release Management to provide that. | think all we can do is ask the question.

My view is that Charles is “fishing” and | don’t personally support any of these requests. However they seem
harmless — other than wasting a lot of people’s time — and hence money.

Kind regards
Penny

Jarnail,

As a result of the meeting that took place between Charles
McLachlan and Gareth Jenkins as directed by the judge, we now need
to have:-"

- access to the system in the Midlands where it appears there are
live, reproducible errors

- access to the operations at Chesterfield to understand how
reconciliation and transaction corrections are dealt with.

- access to the system change requests, known error log and new
release documentation to understand what problems have had to be
fixed.
