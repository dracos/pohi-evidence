Pete,

Thank you for this. It would be much better if the TfS user could be there in person, but as you say Skype would be
worst case.

Kind regards

I can get a demo of TfS and PEAK on the same day in Bracknell. Worst case will be the TfS would be by
Skype as the team are in Stevenage but I will try to get one of the users to Bracknell.

Pete,

We will shortly need to make arrangements for the experts to attend Bracknell to inspect the Peak system. Jason
Coyne has also asked if it is possible for him to inspect TFS. Is that possible and could it be done with Peak in a day?

It would be really helpful if you could get back to me today.

Kind regards
