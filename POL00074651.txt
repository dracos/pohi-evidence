Belinda,

We will be able to take a view on the merits of trying to settle early when we have an outline of our findings of the case.
That said given that the applicant is seeking "Full compensation for financial losses suffered as a direct result of POL's
erroneous termination of her contract, including, but not limited to, loss of business, loss of earnings and loss of standing
in the community" this is I suggest not a straightforward early settlement case.

Thanks,
Angela

{cannot tell from this why this is considered suitable for early settlement but always happy for a case to be considered
for early settlement. Angela, presumably we will be able to take a view as the investigation progresses as to whether
this is worth considering, and there would be a cost advantage in not passing to Second Sight for investigation and
possibly subsequent mediation so worth a review point.

Best wishes
Belinda

Hi all,

Please note that Ben Thorpe has flagged this case as one that may be suitable for settlement. And has also raise some
complexities.

The loss is claimed at just under £9K - and it is alleged that this was sustained from administrative errors due to a lack of
training and subsequent investigation into the issues raised.

Please do let me know if this is a case you would like to consider making an offer on. I have attached the CQR to this
email as well as the JA and quantum analysis.

Thanks,
Lena

Hi Wendy,

Solicitor Comments.

The allocated solicitor has noted that this case may be suitable for early settlement. Ben has flagged the sensitive nature
of internal correspondence which have been obtained by the applicant.

In addition, Ben has noted that It is not immediately obvious from the CQR and the supporting documents why the SPM
was terminated - a smail debt with no obvious indications of any deliberate or on-going errors or misconduct. Due to the
complexity of these issues the case investigator should contact Ben Thorp before proceeding.

Regards,

Matt.
