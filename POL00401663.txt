Dear Colin,
Operational Business Change - Products

I wrote to Tony Oppenheim on the above subject on 9 November 2000, and
following subsequent discussion at the Contract Admin Board on 14 December, he
wrote back to me on 3*4 January 2001 recording the agreement reached at that
meeting.

Since the Change Request to incorporate that agreement into the Codified Agreement
has not yet been raised, and because of POCL’s current requirement to replace the BT
Bills icon on the top level menu with a new icon for the services being introduced for
the Quantrill products, I am writing to confirm that I agree with Tony’s record of the
discussion at the Contract Admin Board and specifically to re-confirm POCL’s
agreement to the proposal in relation to the “transaction time benchmark
adjustment” being carried forward to subsequent releases.

As clarified in subsequent discussions at Contract Admin Board meetings, the
adjustment should be the net cumulative effect of all changes - so that if a product
was moved in the menu hierarchy twice during the course of a release, then the
carry-forward would be the net change from its original to its final menu position
during that currency of the release.

Given the above confirmations, can you please confirm that the interim agreement to
use OBC Product Change for menu changes given in Tony Oppenheim’s 3"4 January.
letter will continue to apply in the case of the Quantrill product changes.
