10‘ November 1999

1.1

ACCEPTANCE

OVERALL SUMMARY

Progress against plan for the 13 former Acceptance Incidents forming the bulk
of the Acceptance Resolution Timetable is reviewed below in Acceptance
Resolution Timetable order. A meeting on 9/11 is expected to have produced
a report of metrics for former Als 376, 298 and 408. Pathway has provided
POCL with copies of the working Acceptance Resolution Timetable planning
charts for progress updating.

211: The monitoring phase has now completed and Closure approval was
due on 1/11. An incident raised under 376 on 2/11, but going right back to
week 29, has superficial similarities and so the monitoring period is extended
pro tem.

342 : Horizon is to confirm that the TIP gateway machine is being cleared
down since 19/10 and to approve Closure.

390 : The AP counter enhancement is awaiting distribution. It is due in the
field by 30/11.

376 : Interface stability: A meeting to list and discuss all incidents will have
been held on 9 November.

Additional Reconciliation : The first Integration and Cycle 1 started as forecast
on 25/10 and is expected to finish 17/11. The Cycle 2 and 3 activity is
forecast to start 22/11. POCL has reviewed the Test Strategy and is
discussing the HLTP with Pathway on 8/11.

378 : The diagnostic fix has found no null pointer-type problems. A new
activity has been put into the plan to extend the monitoring period to the end
of November.

369 : POCL has proposed to DSS to extend the trial to a further 16 offices for
the four weeks to 8/12 with PIRA testing the rejected bar-codes. The report is
planned for 7/1/00, thus extending the activities beyond the plan dates.
Pathway will produce a paper describing potential improvement areas by
10/11, this being Pathway’s last action.

372: The long POCL review of software distribution process and reports has
begun, lasting until mid January.

298 : The achievement for week 31 was 119 units and for week 32 145.5
units, averaging 132+, compared with the par figure of merit figure of 137.
The week 32 figure excludes a spike of out of hours problems believed to
have been precipitated by an Energis switch failure.

218 : The report of Trainer Quality Monitoring is in preparation. CCN 543b
(RNM training) remains open. CCN 566 (Training Window) is published. The
post training consolidation review has completed satisfactorily.

391: The vehicle access and alarm response procedures are complete. The
Wigan back gate work will now finish around 12/11, it is due at the end of
November.

314 : There is now just one of the eight chapters of the API document
specified by CR/SPE/007 to complete. The manual is due for first delivery by
23/11 and Appendices planned by 28/12.

408 : There were two further compliance audits of the HSH cash account
script usage. The remaining actions are maintaining the staffing profile and
SLA monitoring, a report for which is provided weekly, last on 2/11.

412: The only action left is for POCL to agree two process documents.

There remains one former Al, Al 232, where there is a disagreement as to
severity - None (Pathway) and Low (POCL). This is with the POCL and
Pathway Commercial departments to progress. One-line resolution plans for
the, now 53, agreed Low Als are available for agreement. Of these 22 are for
resolution within CSR+.

IMPLEMENTATION

NATIONAL ROLL OUT

The rollout programme is approaching the Christmas break period and
installations will cease from 12 November and rollout will resume from 24"
January 2000. During this period Pathway will be undertaking a number of
measures to review and fine-tune the activities and processes surrounding
rollout. Running concurrently with this will be the RNM clusters and Major offices
‘paid study’ looking at revisions to the implementation plan. Following receipt of
a further CR, the study will now be extended to include ALPS offices. Work on
the study is ready to commence following POCL approval of the CCN. The first
part of the study encompasses activities based around the RODB and secondly
the feasibility study will address the detail of the rollout profile.

Activity to implement CCN 561 (side agreement to the Second Supplemental
Agreement) has been completed with all the obligations having been
implemented through documentation and process changes. It is understood
that POCL are still awaiting written confirmation from the National Federation of
Sub-postmasters of acceptance of the single installation date, although it is
believed this is a formality.

Pathway and POCL Implementation management met on the 5" November
1999 to review installation dropout rates and lessons learned from National
Rollout to date. It was agreed that installation dropout levels are as expected
and still falling. Further reductions in the levels of installation suspensions and
aborts are anticipated from process improvements made recently and process
reviews currently being undertaken by Pathway’s Implementation team.

Progress continues to be made to recover the scheduling gap created by the 2-
week approval process during acceptance. It is anticipated that all new
installation units entering the installation process from early December will be
able to follow the full 16-week cycle. To minimise impact, joint agreement was
reached to delay one UAE event in November by one week to maximise the
notice period for postmasters.

INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMME

Surveys for trolleys are continuing, but there are a small percentage of offices
that need minor re-work to enable the trolleys to fit.

The infrastructure programme has now scheduled nearly all the outlets we

currently have available. There are some 2000 outlets not yet released from
POCL that needs to be reviewed in order to complete infrastructure programme.

2.4.1

A meeting was held on 5"" November to review the process and current status of
releasing suspended outlets into the infrastructure programme. With the greater
understanding of the information shared at this meeting it is expected that
improvements in the process will be achieved.

INSTALLATION PROGRAMME

As of the 5"" November 1999, 1811 outlets had been installed and migrated to
the Horizon system, achieving the programme milestone target of 1800 live
outlets. This was a major achievement for the programme and has resulted from
the hard work and co-operation of all the parties involved. Staff in Pathway and
POCL managing the installation process centrally and in the regions should be
congratulated on this achievement.

An implementation plan for outlets requiring frame relay communications has
been produced and is being reviewed by all concerned.

Discussions continue with suppliers over productivity, improvements and the
revised rollout plan for next year. A review plan has been created for
implementation to take all lessons learnt to date, from Pathway and suppliers,
and make improvements in preparation for the new start date in January 2000.

USER IMPLEMENTATION AND MIGRATION

Training Scheduling

Pathway is currently planning a demonstration for POCL Implementation to
provide assurances of the capability, robustness and contingency available from
the training scheduling and administration systems. This will complete the
activity planned to address the recent concerns over training scheduling and
provide positive feedback against the rollout criteria for this item.

A further 120 training systems have been built in order to satisfy the
requirements of the first phase of NRO in January 2000. A further 148 systems
will be built during the Christmas closure.

The Pre-Entry event was signed off this week, but will require POCL make some
amendments to the contents of their section of the course. It is understood the
POCL input will be reviewed at a dry run on 9"" November 1999.

The amended PSA process was put in place this week and a trainer briefing
session was held, covering the changes and how they will be applied to the
courses. It is intended that POCL and Pathway Training teams will be
observing the second day of one of the training courses.

An End-to End workshop to run through training scheduling scenarios,

processes and issues will be run next week in order to review and plan
improvements for the training plans for NRO.

Acceptance Incident Al 218

ICL Pathway has completed the vast majority of its actions on the Rectification
Plan for Al218, although some POCL actions are outstanding. This was
reviewed with POCL on 5" November 1999.

SLAs this month have improved, but it is evident that any spike in the workload
will have a negative impact on SLA performance. This was demonstrated

when stamp revaluation occurred in mid-October.

A list of the top five postmaster issues has been collated through discussion
with the PLMs, BSM and a review of Service Visit Reply Cards and call
records. Each of the issues will be thoroughly investigated and appropriate
corrective action identified and implemented. The weekly results to date for the

3.1.2.1 Management Information

e As part of Al298, MSU are continuing to work jointly with POCL to analyse
HSH calls relating to systems instability. Call volumes and categorisations
have been agreed for the main monitoring period against 782 offices,
which commenced 21/10/99 for four weeks.

e MSU are currently on schedule to produce and dispatch the Service
Review Book (for October) by 05/11/99 within the agreed timescale. The
figures supplied for the Al408 rectification plan are being used to populate
the HSH section of the SRB.

e The SLA workshop held with POCL on 27/10/99 was successful in
achieving the goal documented within the Al408 rectification plan. MSU
presented the end to end SLA process from transaction capture within the
DWH to the reporting of SLA information via SLAM. We also presented an
analysis of September's HSH SLA calculations, which have been re-
worked following incorrect housekeeping processes at the HSH. POCL
have accepted that our procedures for this re-working are sound, however
they have requested some further examples of re-worked HSH calls from
the Al408 monitoring period to check for consistency of approach.

3.1.2.2 Business / Reconciliation Incident Management

e There are currently 166 PinlICLs assigned to MSU. The majority of the
incidents being handled still centre around the 'non-polling' of live outlets.
Most of the problems only occur for 24 hours before disappearing and are
usually caused by Outlets having their Counters switched off. We have
now agreed with POCL following a meeting on 29/10/99, that offices
reported as not having polled for 1 day will still be reported to POCL but no
incident or investigation process will be initiated by ICL Pathway. Offices
reported as not having polled for 2 days or more will still receive full
investigation.

e The RED incident management workshop has now been completed
(02/11/99). This was held to rationalise the reporting of incidents both into
the HSH and subsequently back to POCL via the RED process. We have
been experiencing many problems here with POCL suggesting that the
information we supply them is insufficient to allow them to progress a
business / reconciliation incident to resolution. The workshop has output an
new list of incident categories agreed between the two parties together
with a statement of requirements from POCL highlighting what they expect
to see on a RED report for a given incident type.

e The second version of the EPOSS reconciliation report specification has
been received for review within MSU. We are also obligated (as part of
acceptance) to attend a workshop with POCL to discuss and finalise the
report distribution and incident handling process. In advance of this
workshop, MSU are to provide a document highlighting our draft procedure
by close of play 12/11/99

3.2.2.2

A technical review was held with POCL on the 27" October, regarding
“Index Corruption” issues on Correspondence Servers. At the review answers
were provided to the questions raised by POCL. These will be detailed in a
follow up memo. A fix to correct this problem is currently being tested, and
will be released shortly.

Audit Server

The Audit Server Hoarder failed on Sunday 31st October and gathering and
deleting of the backlog of old files stopped. The fault was identified and
cleared and the Hoarder re-started. All issues are now resolved and the
back ups have been completed.

Networks

Energis reported a power failure on the Kearsley network switch on Friday
29th October. Pathway’s network successfully failed over to the backup
switch at Birmingham. Energis held a Board Meeting and issued an interim
report on the failure on Monday 1st November. A full report on the failure is
expected from Energis by close of business on Friday 5th November.

SLA Management

APS

« A meeting was held with POCL to deal with the Polling Exception Report
and the Late Polling Report issues. Pathway explained to OSG how the
report is generated and showed it to be correct and OSG accepted the
explanations. Issue closed.

« POCL have agreed that Incidents need not be raised for offices not polled
for a single day. POCL BSM has agreed to phone those offices to check
that they have not turned off the equipment and to emphasise the reasons
why they should not turn off equipment.

e No file delivery issues.

cTO
¢ Token validation for CTO41 (December 99) has been completed.

e OSG have been requested to obtain the offending Eastern Energy tokens
so that Pathway can test the tokens to identify the root cause of the
problem. A fix, to introduce an error message to assist Post Masters, has
passed Development testing and will be in Operational Testing this week.

e« At POCL’s request, 4 additional CTO schedule cycles have been
introduced into the timetable, to enable POCL to add in extra tokens
outside the regular schedules. A plan for the introduction of a CTO
schedule to go live in January 2000 has been produced. POCL have
agreed to the plan but the charging structure for these new CTO schedules
has yet to be finalised.

Resubmission of the CR for the new Token Verification Service is still
awaited. It has been agreed that work will proceed under the current OLA
and process documentation, as it is likely to take some time for POCL to
resubmit the CR.

3.2.2.3 AP Client Migration

Pathway has agreed to submit a version of the plan to POCL that indicates
the dependencies on POCL with deadlines for their provision to Pathway.

The Strategy document is to be revised to exclude the illustrative plans as
a formal plan now exists.

Although good progress is being made regarding migration activities,
visiting the Clients and establishing AIS/TIS requirements is behind
schedule. The first AP Client is to be visited w/e 5/11/99. This is the major
risk to the project, as Pathway cannot detail the work to be undertaken
within Development and Implementation without first establishing AIS/TIS
requirements.

3.2.2.4 TIP

A joint TIP/RDS/ICL Pathway Steering Meeting addressed issues such as
the OLA amendments and the TPS Operational review meetings. OLA
comments have been sent to TIP and are to be incorporated into a draft
OLA and circulated for review. A first draft of the TPS Operational Review
Meeting documentation has been sent to POCL. Once this is agreed, the
TPS Operational Reviews can begin.

POCL have made no progress yet on specifying their requirements for
interim Disaster Recovery (DR) contingency, or their proposals for the long
term DR solution.

No issues with File Delivery.

3.2.3 Change Management

3.2.3.1 Reference Data

A total of 205 reference data changes were released to the live estate
since the last report, this includes a further significant number of outlet
changes, the backlog of which is now down to 90. In the last two weeks
there were 41 correction files and 69 migration special files representing
approximately 17% and 35% respectively of the total number of files
received. The migration specials continue to be higher than anticipated.

The quality of POCL supplied Reference Data is being discussed within
Pathway and POCL. Pathway are considering what actions can be taken,
both by Pathway and POCL, to improve the quality of the supplied data
and reduce the risks of incorrect data being supplied to the live estate
counters.

3.2.3.2

e The initial incremental update to Reference Data for SIP16 was delivered

to Pathway last week, however there have been a number of issues with
this data and a meeting has been arranged to discuss and agree the way
forward.

e The total number of PiniCLs outstanding on POCL with regard to

Reference Data remains at 25. In addition there have been a considerable
number of PinlCLs issued against the Reference Data for CSR+ testing.

e An unfortunate misuse of the Operational Business Change process by

POCL led to changes to buttons for Giro Bank operations moving to new
screen locations before counter staff were informed that the change was to
occur. The Counter News for this change was still in preparation at the
time that the buttons changed. Pathway is reviewing, with POCL, possible
modifications to the procedure to avoid such problems in the future.

e The meeting arranged with BSM to discuss changes to the Interface

Agreement for Operational Business Change (Product) has been
postponed at Pathway’s request whilst a joint review of the process is
carried out.

e The number of changes to outlet information awaiting authorisation for

release from POCL NCAs has improved considerably, even though there
are currently 90 outstanding.

e The interim corrections for the problems associated with loading new data

on the RDMC whilst earlier versions are still being verified/released are
progressing well. The long-term solution is targeted to be operational by
mid January 2000.

e A change, verified and authorised for release by POCL OSG in

Farnborough in the normal way, erroneously removed the request for an
account number when an item for a deposit greater than £60 was
transacted. A correction was released on the same day that the error was
discovered.

Software Distribution

Problems are being encountered in clearing the tail. Daily statistics are being
prepared on counters that consistently fail software distribution and
investigations are continuing to focus on these counters. The flow of
Acceptance Incident fixes is now much reduced.
