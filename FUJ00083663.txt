li/ This problem is the route cause of the reconciliation error closed in PC0126042

2/ Presumably the route cause is deemed to be software not hardware

3/ the Postmaster has a workaround in place which is not to duplicate transactions (e.g. Transfer In) just because the original
attempts were successful but not showing on all nodes

I4/ POA CS MSU have a workaround in place which is that if 3/ above is not followed & PC0126042 reoccurs, a BIMS will be issued
ladvising POL to issue a Transaction Correction

5/ There is no SLT for software fixes as they are delivered based upon the priority or severity of the issue and could remain
lbpen until both businesses decide a fix is necessary or the work around is adequate

Jez Murray has advised Julie Dart of this by email as could not voice at the timestamp of this update
