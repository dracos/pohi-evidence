Dear George and Philip
It was lovely to speak with you this afternoon.

In advance of our meeting next week, we will be considering the following points:
1) The restrictions on the Post Office's ability to sell to a private commercial entity under the Postal Services Act
2011;
2) The restrictions on NFSP under the grant agreement with the Post Office;
3) Any leverage under the Restrictions Policy;
4) Individual subpostmaster rights under the agreements between the subpostmasters and the Post Office

To this end, we would be grateful for the most recent versions of the following documents:

Grant Agreement (between NFSP and the Post Office);
Restrictions Policy;
Example contracts for the different types of subpostmasters (for example, local and main office), and any

associated documents.
Please let me know if you have any questions.

All the best

Molly
