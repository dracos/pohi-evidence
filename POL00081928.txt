Attached are details of the reported problem at Callendar Square where Brown was the

postmaster. Fujitsu looked into the matter and eventually replaced the system at the branch. I think we need to
get this detail to Fujitsu asap for their comments as to why this problem could not have affected Castleton's
system and why we can distinguish the problem.

Please get in touch asap if the attachment is too big to get through and I will arrange to have it faxed across.

I have spgkdn to Sandra Mackay, who was the previous SAM for Grangemouth.

This was nothe office that had Horizon problems but the Postmasters other branch Calendar Square. Sandra told
me and unfoktunately this is backed up in the logs below, that a problem with the Horizon system was admitted
and the Pastmaster had his system replaced. There is also reference to other branches having issues.

Sandra/Brian,

Pretty much the same status with Callendar Square. They need to let Horizon Systems Desk know if they have further
problems, and the fix should be down to them with the S90 release as stated in my previous e-mail. As you can see fror
the e-mail below though, there is now recognition that is a wider issue than just a software "quirk" at just one branch,
which means it is now being activiely managed as a cross domain problem with Fujitsu.

It appears that Callendar square is not alone with it's mismatch problem. It also appears that Fujitsu are expecting S90
release to resolve this quirk.

We have opened a cross domain problem record, Lynne Fallowfield is the contact.

Only advice for the branch is to continue logging instances of the problem with HSD.

Lynne, I was waiting for an update on this branch Callendar Sq see the email
chain below. The problem is possible the same as the others that still have
mis matches and whther thay have been moving Stock units ?.

I think i am inclined as per this issue to wait and see if all these
branches are OK after the S90 counter roll out starts 4th after the pilot

this week.

I will maybe just get Anne to check these out to see if there is any
commonality with this Callendar sq.

Mike,

I believe John has already responded to this, so don't know if you need any
more from me...

Haven't looked at the recent evidence, but I know in the past this site had
hit this Riposte lock problem 2 or 3 times within a few weeks. This problem
has been around for years and affects a number of sites most weeks, and
finally Escher say they have done something about it. I am interested in
whether they really have fixed it which it why I left the call open - to
remind me to check over the whole estate once $90 is live - call me cynical
but I do not just accept a 3rd party's word that they have fixed something!

What I never got to the bottom of, having usually had more pressing things
to do, was why this outlet was particularly prone to the problem. Possibly
because they follow some particular procedure/sequence which makes it more
likely to happen? This could still be worth investigating, especially if
they have continuing problems, but I don't think it is worthwhile until we
know the $90 position.

Please note that KELs tell SMC that they must contact sites and warn them of
balancing problems if they notice the event storms caused by the held lock,
and advise them to reboot the affected counter before continuing with the
balance. Unfortunately in practice it seems to take SMC several hours to
notice these storms by which time the damage may have been done

Rgs Mike

John, As Anne is away could I have your comments as you were involved as
well.

Rgs Mike

Anne, You are always a good place to start, having read the call I see you
have left the following note:Call E-0510120769

Wed 01 February 2006 15:55 by PINICL / Saved: Wed 01 February 2006 15:55
Update by Anne Chambers:Category 40 -- Pending -- Incident Under
Investigation:The timeout events are apparently fixed in a new Riposte
version released at $90 - see PC0126376. I've looked at problems reported on
31st Jan - can't see why the system reported disconnected nodes, nor why the
same user could log on twice (except that this followed a session transfer
which silently failed, for no obvious reason). I don't think there were any
ill-effects. I think the best thing now is to see what happens after S90.
I'll continue to keep this call open to remind me that this site should be
checked then.

I notice that in the early guise of this problem in the call it states the
PM as Female:

Wed 12 October 2005 17:39 by UK956078 / HSH1 Saved: Wed 12 October 2005
17:39 Pm was trying to transfer £2490 from node 7 onto node 2. She states
that she has accepted the transfer on node 2 but the system is not showing
this. On node 7 it is showing pending transfer but it is not showing on node
2. It appears on her transfer sheet as cmpleated.

At the bottom of this email re a magical £43k appearing and disapearing the
PM is Male He reports:

You may recall that in September the above office had major problems with
their Horizon system relating to transfers between stock units.

The Spmr has reported that he is again experiencing problems with transfers,
(05.01.06) which resulted in a loss of around £43k which has subsequently

EVERSPLIT0002834
POLO00081928
POL00081928

rectified itself. I know that the Spmr has reported this to Horizon
Support , who have come back to him stating that they cannot find any
problem.

Clearly the Spmr is concerned as we have just spent a number of months
trying to sort out the first instance and he doesn't want a repeat
performance. He is convinced that there is something wrong with his Horizon
kit. TI would be grateful if you could investigate this and give him any
support that you can. I'm due to visit the office tomorrow to have a look
at his paperwork and discuss the situation with him.

So apologies for the long windedness but I have been given this by Liz as a
problem so:

1. Is there a problem at this branch ? is it Horizon kit or is there an
issue with staff there ?

2. If there is an issue is this $90 release the cure ? how confident are
you/we it will fix the problem ?

3. S90 counter release due week 4th March. Getting Sarah to check if this
site is in the pilot 24th or just part of the general release 4th March.

Appreciate your comments please

Gary,
Thanks for looking into this for us. Couple of questions occur: -

Do we understand why this particular branch has been having problems? or
are there other branches in the network that have been having this
problem?

Can this branch be front ended on the counter release of $90 such that
it gets the fix as soon as possible?

The e-mail from Liz suggests that there may be a reoccurence following
S90. What degree of certainty do we have that it will definitely be
fixed?

Sandra/Brian - Appreciate this is frustrating for the branch but from the
e-mail below you can see that the branches issue should be fixed with the
release of the $90 software. I have asked Gary above to see if we can put
this branch to the front of the queue for the $90 release. In the meantime
it is important that the branch continues to report any issues into HSD.

cary,

Need your advise on this branch. There appears to be an ongoing problem at
this branch with transfers between SU's causing a receipts and payments
mismatch. This first came to my attention some 3 or 4 months ago, when the
branch was chasing up an error notice to account for a loss that they had
that was related to the R & P mismatch. I believe in that case that FS had
taken it on board and were investigating it as a problem (I seem to recall
it had a PinICL number). I had to do some chasing around with P & BA to
ensure that the error notice got issued, as there was a breakdown in
processes between them and FS relating to the BIM report.

Since then it appears to have happened again, although Fujitsu are saying
no issue could be detected. I am concerned that there is a fundamental flaw
with the branches configuration, and would be interested to know how FS put
the first issue to bed.

Let me know your thoughts.

Telephoned the office and Allan said that he was
having problems again with transfers. He has
contacted the Horizon helpdesk who have
subsequently come back to him to say that there
is no system problem and that he should contact
NBSC. He did this and from what I can
understand the NBSC have told him that he is
trying to balance on two different terminals. Allan
disputes this and is adamant that there is a
system error.

Resolution
agreed on the

A diary date had already been set to visit the
office on 12.01.06 to go over Allan’s audit report.
It was agreed that I would visit along with Brian
on that date and go over any paperwork that

We discussed the problems that had been encountered in September with
the Horizon system and the more recent recurrence. Alan (Spmr) showed

This office had severe problems balancing on Wk 25, resulting in a
shortage of £6,414.46. After checking various reports I am satisfied that
the error is made up of:

£3,489.69 — Transfers

£2,870 — Giro Deposits

£54.52 — unidentified (however due to all the coming and going with re-
keying entries, then this could come back as an error.

The Spmr claims that there was a Horizon software problem on 14.09.05
from 15.30 onwards. This was picked up when a member of staff noticed
that a transaction, which had been taken by another member of staff, had
not been entered onto the system, so therefore she put the transaction
through. She checked at the time with her colleague who said that she
thought she had put it through already however she accepted that she
could have made a mistake. Following on from that, it was picked up that
other giro business deposits that had been entered had not come up on the
system, so they were re-keyed.

There was also a problem with transfers from one stock to another, in that
they had doubled up. The Spmr made several telephone calls to the
NBSC, telling them about his problems and he was advised to carry on with
balancing and produce his Cash Account. Whilst doing this a warning
came up, however the NBSC told the staff to continue to roll over. The
result was that the office balanced £6,414.46 short.

The Spmr spoke to the Horizon Support Centre (ref E0509150123) who
investigated and agreed that there had been a navigation problem that had

now been rectified. They told the Spmr that they would report to NBSC that
they had identified and rectified the problem and that the amount could be
held in the suspense account. However, as part of the shortage relates to
transfers, and no error notice will be issued, then the Suspense Account
Team are not prepared to authorise the entry.

I telephoned The Suspense Account Team (Ann Wilde), who told me that
checks could be made with Girobank after next Wednesday, and if that
shows that duplications have been made, then they will authorise the
amount to be moved to the suspense account, until the office receives an
error notice. However, Ann stands by what she said about the transfer
problems, and that they would not move this amount to The Suspense
Account.

I went back to the Horizon Support Centre and spoke to a supervisor (Ken).
He said that the call had now been closed as the problem had been
rectified. I asked what was to happen about the resulting shortage and he
referred me back to NBSC, who they said would do various checks. I then
contacted NBSC, spoke to Rob Hughes and told him the story — he said he
would put a call through to Service Support. No follow up was received
from Service Support regarding this call.

28.09.05 -E mailed C&SM requesting that he look at the string of e mails,
hoping that he will be able to take it forward, as I don’t seem to be getting
anywhere.

Telephoned Alan as requested. He is concerned that he has still not heard
anything regarding the loss that he is rolling. I told him that I had now
involved the C&SM who in turn has contacted Andy. I agreed that I would
make some enquiries and let him know my findings. I discussed this with
Andy who has agreed to send another e mail relating to the shortfall due to
the Horizon failure to Shaun Turner, meanwhile the office should continue
to roll the loss. The Spmr has been in touch with Girobank, who confirm
that an error notice will be issued in due course for £2870.25. The £1,000
PBNE is also being investigated. I will contact the office on Monday 10
October to update them.

Please let me know if this e-mail is not received.

The matters in this e-mail will have to be taken up with Fujitsu asap as hopefully they can identify the fact that
this was a one off problem with the kit and distinguish it from Castleton.

Attached are details of the reported problem at Callendar Square where Brown was the postmaster. Fujitsu
looked into the matter and eventually replaced the system at the branch. I think we need to get this detail to
Fujitsu asap for their comments as to why this problem could not have affected Castleton's system and why we
can distinguish the problem.

Please get in touch asap if the attachment is too big to get through and I will arrange to have it faxed across.

I have spoken to Sandra Mackay, who was the previous SAM for Grangemouth.

This was not the office that had Horizon problems but the Postmasters other branch Calendar Square. Sandra told
me and unfortunately this is backed up in the logs below, that a problem with the Horizon system was admitted
and the Postmaster had his system replaced. There is also reference to other branches having issues.
