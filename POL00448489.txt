Thanks Jack - sorry I may have missed it.
One final thing: can I just double-check, if there will be any attendees from POL (aside from Nick Read)

Thanks and have a great weekend!

Hi Enifome,
I went back on this — but perhaps you weren’t on the thread. In short — yes, including funding.
Thanks,

Jack

Hiya Jack and Jamie,

I just wanted to clarify, when Jack says POL was expecting items such as 'Horizon/Capture' - can I clarify
whether this is re possibility for compensation pre-Horizon?

Thanks again,
Enifome

Hi Jack,
Ahead of Nick Read/Minister Hollinrake's meeting next week, below is the current shape of our agenda:

POL's Central Costs (standing item)
Update on Corporation Tax
POL readiness for Disclosure of Information (once convictions are overturned by the new legislation)
Horizon/Capture
AOB:
a. Reflections/Follow-ups after the 27th Feb Select Committee

oe 2 ee

Given how padded the agenda is - I think I'll leave off ‘Fujitsu and Project Boland (on Suspense Accounts)' for
now. Perhaps we can consider this item for the next monthly meeting.
BTW - sorry if this sounds daft - but I was wondering, what is 'Project Boland'?

Also just for clarification, regarding item 4 - Horizon/Capture - is this regarding if there will be any
compensation for pre-horizon cases, right?

Many thanks,
Enifome

Works for me — thanks Enifome. If you can shed any light on second point before 3.30pm, that would be great
too.

Thanks,

Jack

Hiya Jack,
Thanks for getting the ball rolling with this on our side.

Re your 1“ point with regards to the agenda for the Ministerial Meeting - is it ok if I get back to you tomorrow

Many thanks,

Hope you all had a nice weekend — and that the ST article didn’t mean you were working.

Two quick things from me, while Jamie is on leave.
1. I believe there’s a Ministerial meeting next week. Do you have any agenda items you’d like raised in
particular? If we could agree this today / tomorrow, that would be great so we can give the relevant
teams notice. We were expecting items like costs; Horizon/Capture; Fujitsu and Project Boland (on

Suspense Accounts).

2. Conscious the SoS is due to give a statement later today. Are you able to give any indication as to the
tone or substance of this so we can prepare our lines accordingly? Happy to jump on a call if easier on
this latter point.

Jamie is back on Thursday, but just wanted to get the conversation started.
Thanks,

Jack
