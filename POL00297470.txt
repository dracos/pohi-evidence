Post Office Horizon Q&A — Strictly Confidential
8 July 2013 v2

1. Generic

You have accepted that your support processes could be improved. Do you think this means
subpostmasters have been unfairly convicted?

We take forward very few prosecutions - approximately 50 a year and with a network of 11,800 post offices that
means such cases are not commonplace

We cannot comment any individual cases but of course all cases were fully tested in court and no evidence found to
suggest the Horizon system is at fault.

We have a duty to investigate where there is suspicion of wrong-doing. Subpostmasters are pillars of the community
and must abide by high standards of probity in that role. The public would be surprised if we did not take action
where public money may have been misappropriated.

Where cases have been prosecuted through the courts, there are avenues open to those who feel they have been
wrongly convicted.

Are you saying you are going to review all these cases?

The review has raised some concerns regarding our training and support processes. Of course it is only right that a
review should be undertaken of any cases where we feel the findings of this interim review might have any bearing.

Who will undertake the review of any cases where the review might have bearing?

This will be undertaken by an external law firm.

2. The Review
Why is it taking so long to conclude this review?

We commissioned this independent review to address the concerns that have been raised with us and we welcome
its publication. We are committed to completing this review, but we will not be waiting until then to take action on
some of the issues identified in this report -- indeed we have already taken significant steps in some areas.

All those who work in the post office network in communities across the country are the lifeblood of our business.
We take our responsibilities to them very seriously.

I’ve heard there is evidence of faults with the system?

As the review stresses, the Horizon system has around 68,000 users and processes more than six million
transactions every day. While we take every case very seriously, the total number of cases accepted by the
external reviewers for this review was 47, less than 0.1 0.1 per cent of the total number of users of the Horizon
system.

With a system of this scale, of course there may be exceptions whether this is as a result of a power cut or through
operator error. We have systems in place to identify and rectify these as quickly as possible. (Check against findings
in report)

Whenever reconciliation issues arise in the system, we contact branches to inform them that reconciliation is
required, either by the Post Office or in branch.

I’ve heard that only a few cases are being reviewed what about the rest of the cases raised by MPs?
POL00297470
POL00297470

With the consent and approval of both the JFSA and individual SPMR’s, the review was fast tracked to identify key
issues that were relevant to the remit of the investigation.

We cannot comment on individual cases, and indeed the review rightly protects anonymity of those involved.

Is this a cover up by you and Fujitsu?

Absolutely not. We commissioned this independent review to address the concerns raised with us and we welcome
its publication. We are committed to completing this review, but we will not be waiting until then to take action on
some of the issues identified in this report -- indeed we have already taken significant steps in some areas.

All those who work in the post office network in communities across the country are the lifeblood of our business.
We take our responsibilities to them very seriously and recognise that we can always improve the way we support
them and their business.

Why have you destroyed documents relating to criminal investigations? What data retention and record
keeping protocols do you have in place that would justify this?

In line with industry standards we operate a seven year document retention policy.

The report states that the Post Office was deliberately uncooperative during the review process. What do
you say to this?

This is absolutely not the case we commissioned and have fully supported this review. We welcome the publishing
of this interim report and are committed to concluding the review into any outstanding cases.

3. Horizon

Could there be further issues of this nature?

We welcome the conclusion of this interim report that there are no systemic issues with the Horizon system.

As the review stresses, the Horizon system has around 68,000 users and processes more than six million
transactions every day. While we take every case very seriously, the total number of cases accepted by the external

reviewer was 47, less than 0.1 per cent of the total number of users of the Horizon system.

However, as part of its ongoing engagement with relevant parties, the post office has committed to further
improvements that will be made to the system and supporting processes.

What other faults were raised in the other cases?

We provided information on two anomalies involving a receipts/ payments mismatch and historic accounting
entries. Both of these were found by the Post Office and voluntarily communicated to the independent review
company.

Modifications have already been made to rectify these issues and all subpostmasters involved were informed of
this. None of the subpostmasters involved have been prosecuted.

We welcome the conclusion of this interim report that there are no systemic issues with the Horizon system. This
will give confidence to the 60,000 people who use Horizon regularly. This is a system which deals with six million
transactions every day.

Could customers have lost money? How can FS customers (and others) have confidence that their money
is safe?

There is no suggestion that customers’ transactions have not been processed. The review was in relation to small
number of cases which we agreed to review to ensure our subpostmasters can have confidence in our processing
system.

Is it just too complex a system?

How much did Horizon cost?

Need answer

How can you justify this amount of spend in a system which doesn’t work?

We welcome the conclusion of this interim report that there are no systemic issues with the Horizon system. This

will give confidence to the 60,000 people who use Horizon regularly. This is a system which deals with six million
transactions every day.

4. Support and training

Banks and other financial institutions spend far longer training their people. Why don’t you invest more in
this?

The thousands of subpostmasters and their staff who work in the post office network in communities across the
country are the lifeblood of our business. We take our responsibilities to them very seriously and recognise that we
can always improve the way we support them and their business.

We are not waiting for the full review to take action on the issues that have been identified in this interim report --
indeed we have already taken significant steps in some areas.

We plan to review our support services for subpostmasters and their staff and are setting up a working group to
conduct this review. We hope the JFSA will take part in this process.

What support structures do you have in place for subpostmasters when they have an issue?

Currently, the NFSP are the trade association for subpostmasters. They negotiate with post office on behalf of
subpostmasters and provide representation at disciplinary meetings.

In response to the findings in the report, we are creating a new Business User Forum within our business to provide
a way for subpostmasters and others to raise issues around business processes at the highest level. It will be
chaired by a member of our Executive Committee and report to that committee.

We hope the JFSA will take part in this forum. We intend that its first role will be to work with the JFSA and others
to bring the full review of outstanding cases where concerns have been raised to a conclusion.

We also plan to review our support services for subpostmasters and their staff and are setting up a working group to
conduct this review. We hope the JFSA will take part in this process.

What training do you offer to subpostmasters?
Our training packages are regularly reviewed and changed to meet the needs of our people and business. Currently,

subpostmasters receive a range of class room and on site training. Depending on the needs of the branch total
training ranges from between 15 to 21 days.

The report states that your helpdesk support sometimes causes further or greater problems — how is this
possible?
POL00297470

We take our responsibilities to subpostmasters very seriously and recognise and are continually reviewing and
improving our processes to improve the way we support them and their business. This includes our helpline
services.

indeed we have already taken significant steps in some areas.

Why do you recruit people without checking if they have the aptitude to use your systems?

The thousands of subpostmasters and their staff who work in the post office network in communities across the
country are the lifeblood of our business. We take our responsibilities to them very seriously and recognise that we
can always improve the way we support them and their business.

The report states that the Post Office does not provide any investigation support to subpostmasters except
where criminality is suspected. Surely these problems could have been resolved earlier had you looked
into them?

We have a clear process where discrepancies are identified and fully investigate all cases where any criminal
activity is suspected. Where a decision to prosecute is made, the evidence is obviously tested in court in the usual
way.

If concerns are raised by customers, subpostmasters or Post Office teams the Post Office Audit team will carry out
an audit. If necessary this would lead to either further investigation or in cases where there is no suggestion of
criminal activity support being provided to the branch to reconcile any issues (need to check).

In the isolated instances where we suspect there may be criminal activity a fuller investigation (including formal
interviews) may then be implemented. As a last resort this may lead to us commencing a prosecution against
someone.

The thousands of subpostmasters and their staff who work in the post office network are the lifeblood of our
business and we take the small numbers of concerns raised with us very seriously. That is why we have
commissioned this review and cooperated with it fully.

You seem to pass on all the risk to subpostmasters, and position any issues as being their fault. Why
would anyone want to be a subpostmaster under these conditions?

The thousands of subpostmasters and their staff who work in the post office network in communities across the
country are the lifeblood of our business. We take our responsibilities to them very seriously and recognise that we
can always improve the way we support them and their business. Our over 11,500 branches successfully process
six million transactions each day. We recognise there are improvements to be made and any concerns must be
addressed, however this review we must this into context the external review considered 47 cases presented
representing less than 0.1 per cent of Horizon Users.

5. Actions
Why are you only admitting to defects now? Have you been hiding them?

We commissioned this independent review to address the concerns that have been raised with us and we welcome
its publication. We look forward to the completion of the full review, but we will not be waiting until then to take
action on some of the issues identified in this report -- indeed we have already taken significant steps in some
areas.

The thousands of subpostmasters and their staff who work in the post office network in communities across the
country are the lifeblood of our business. We take our responsibilities to them very seriously and recognise that we
can always improve the way we support them and their business.

The affected sub-postmasters have been notified and reimbursed where appropriate; a comprehensive audit has
been performed to check there weren't further cases we weren't aware of; and new procedures have been put in
place to ensure such anomalies are spotted at an early stage in the future.

What are the next steps?

We are not waiting for the full review to take action on the issues that have been identified in this interim report and
indeed we have already taken significant steps in some areas.

We are creating a new Business User Forum within our business to provide a way for subpostmasters and others to
taise issues around business processes at the highest level. It will be chaired by a member of our Executive
Committee and report to that committee.

We hope the JFSA will take part in this forum. We intend that its first role will be to work with the JFSA and others
to bring the full review of outstanding cases where concerns have been raised to a conclusion.

We also plan to review our support services for subpostmasters and their staff and are setting up a working group to
conduct this review. We hope the JFSA will take part in this process.

Will you be paying compensation to subpostmasters?

The thousands of subpostmasters and their staff who work in the post office network in communities across the
country are the lifeblood of our business. We take our responsibilities to them very seriously and recognise that we
can always improve the way we support them and their business. It is for that reason, and to consider the issues
which have been raised by some subpostmasters, that we commissioned this independent review.

We hope that the findings of this interim report and the action that we are taking in response will demonstrate our
commitment to continually improving the way we support all those who work in our branch network.

What happens now to the other cases? Only 4 have been reviewed?
We are committed to completing the review.

Have you continued to prosecute people/ has there been an increase in cases filed by postmasters while
this review is ongoing?

Any cases which were raised through this review have been placed on hold pending its outcome. This will remain
the case until the review is concluded.

As with HMRC and other bodies which safeguard public money (Need to check accuracy of this), the Post Office
has investigation and prosecuting authority in its own right.

We have a clear process where discrepancies are identified and fully investigate all cases where any criminal
activity is suspected. Where a decision to prosecute is made, the evidence is obviously tested in court in the usual
way.

How can people reopen their cases if they now feel we have not considered these defects?

Ultimately, concerns about individual convictions will need to be resolved through the Court of Appeal in the usual
way.

How long do these cases go back?

Why are you able to run your own prosecutions? This can’t be fair?

Will you reconsider investigating and prosecuting cases yourself instead handing these functions to the
police and Crown Prosecution Service?

We have absolute confidence in our investigative and prosecuting processes. As with HMRC and other bodies
which safeguard public money (Need to check accuracy of this), the Post Office has investigation and prosecuting
authority in its own right.

We have a clear process where discrepancies are identified and fully investigate all cases where any criminal

What is the POL Investigation & Prosecution process?

If concerns are raised by customers, subpostmasters or Post Office teams the Post Office Audit team will carry out
an audit. If necessary this would lead to either further investigation or in cases where there is no suggestion of
criminal activity support being provided to the branch to reconcile any issues (need to check).

In the isolated instances where we suspect there may be criminal activity a fuller investigation (including formal
interviews) may then be implemented. As a last resort this may lead to us commencing a prosecution against
someone.

Why is POL allowed to run its own prosecution services ?

POL conducts private prosecutions. The right to bring these is in section 6(1) Prosecution of Offences Act, 1985.
There are controls over our exercise of this right as the DPP has the power to take over any such prosecutions.

Have any SPM appealed against convictions?

We are not aware that there have been any appeals against convictions in the Court of Appeal over any Horizon
system challenges.
POL00297470
POL00297470

Have any convictions been overturned?

We are not aware of any that relate to the Horizon system and we would be notified of convictions being
overturned.

6. Chief Executive

Your current CE was Network Director prior to taking the role as CE. Are these failure in processes a result
of her mismanagement?

No, we have always recognised our responsibilities to subpostmasters and take this very seriously. We can always
improve the way we support them and their business. Over the years we have been continually reviewing our
training and support processes to match the needs of our people and we will continue to do this. We are not waiting
for the full review to take action on the issues that have been identified in this interim report

Every concern which has been raised is important to us, however we must put this into context in relation to the
scale of a system which allows over 11,500 branches to successfully processes over 6 million transactions each
day.
