I Perm Sec noted that none of the Schemes are terribly attractive. Cari said that
all options" and "entitled to" in the statement suggests that Government is committing

to give more compensation to claimants than they would actually be receiving.
Carl/Perm Sec noted that through mediation, some claimants will receive much less
than they think they are entitled to.

e Perm Sec generally happy about AO considerations but wants to ensure clarification of
wording of the statement. Tom said that officials will clarify/finalise wording and share
with Perm Sec to ensure she's happy with AO considerations. Tim Parker said that we
need to say something about the 2nd October date.

e Focus moved to slide 9 - status of historic shortfall schemes. Declan said just in excess
of 200 applicants. Will shortly set de minimis levels and start to quantify claims once
panel has reviewed. Stamp scheme is running behind it, and that will be a much lighter
admin scheme, more like a general compensation scheme. Carl noted concerns about
the stamp scheme from a comms perspective, as it ‘shows that POL can't count
stamps'.

Best wishes.

Hi Madhav, Sonny,

Just following up on this.

Would it be possible to have a read-out from yesterdays meeting? I have my own notes but would be
good to compare to yours.

We thought the meeting went well and I hope the Perm Sec and Minister Scully found it useful.
Cheers,

Hi all,

With apologies, Lord Callanan can no longer attend this afternoon as something urgent has come up—
grateful if you can share a readout with me so I can pass on to the Minister, he remains very keen to
stay in the loop (he’s currently actually in the Lords waiting for an OQ on Horizon).

Many thanks,
Mel

Hi all,
Hope you had a good weekend.

Just to confirm as I have had a couple of enquiries over the weekend. There is no material change to
the briefing (reattached) — the only amendment I have made is to update the timing.

To note I believe Tom and Carl will be attending in person in room 8N. All POL attendees will be using
MS Teams.

Any questions please do let me know.

Hi all,

Lord Callanan will be unable to make this new time due to the inaugural weekly transition readiness
meeting between Junior Ministers. Aware we've previously said not to work this meeting around LC
(and this stands) but Minister Scully will have the same meeting.

Hi James,

Background to this meeting in attached e-mail chain. Alan / Gillian to note that the steer at the time
from Ash was that SoS need not attend this, though view might have changed since.

Josh / Beth & Eleanor — could you please socialise this date (01 September 2020 16:00-17:00) with
POL colleagues to check that it works for them?

Many thanks,
