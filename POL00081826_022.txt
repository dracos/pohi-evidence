Please see attached response (from Gareth Jenkins) interleaved, in answer to your questions.

1. Every time that a new customer is served there is a new “session.” Each customer's
transactions are recorded in a “stack.” For each session:

(a) the number of transactions is recorded;

[G13]. The number of transactions is not explicitly recorded. However there is a separate
record for each transaction so the number of transactions can be inferred. NB each MOP
used is also a transaction and so these transactions are also recorded.

(b) the total cost is shown;

[GIJ] Again the total cost is not explicitly recorded. The running total is maintained visually on
the screen, but if multiple payment methods are used, there is no explicit recording of the
total cost in the Audit Trail.

(c) the method of payment is recorded;

[GI] Method of Payment products are just recorded as additional transactions. There is
nothing special about them. Specifically there is nothing to say that they are MOPs (other
than realising that the products related to the transactions are normally used for MOP).

(d) settlement occurs by pressing a button to clear the stack; and
[G13] This is a two stage process:
e A button is pressed to start settlement
« MOP transactions are then recorded until the session is complete (ie value of MOP
transactions equal the value of business transactions). This is frequently achieved with a
shortcut “Fast Cash” MOP which indicates that the exact cash has been tendered.
(e) when the button is pressed to clear the stack, the transaction is complete and
records the information on to the database.

[GIJ] This recording of the transactions occurs when all MOP transactions have been added to

the stack and the net stack value is zero.

2. If machine freezes before the button is pressed to clear the stack, the information is

not recorded because the transaction has not been completed.
[GiJ] Correct. However in some circumstances (ie for specific types of transaction) there may be an

indication of the transaction having taken place in the Audit Trail and recovery of the terminal (even a few

days  3r) may cause the transaction to complete and to be recorded at recovery time. Also, Transactions
relatiy to Failed Mails Labels are recorded immediately rather than waiting for the stack to be settled.

You __jht wish to note that:

Shou the system be restarted (for any reason — including following a “freeze”), there will be evidence of this
in the Audit trail (which we have in fact been examining in this case). Normally the only system restarts
are as part of the overnight “clear desk” function that occurs between 03:30 and 04:00 each day. Any other

On initial investigation I am advised as follows;

‘The gateway was rebooted at about 13:25 on Wed 25th October, possibly because the system froze when printing the
receipt for a postage label. The label itself had been successfully printed at 13:17 (value £1.27).

So the postage label would have been on the stack, but the session was never settled. Any transactions on the stack in
these circumstances are lost (there is a recovery mechanism for banking and AP transactions, but not for other types of

transactions).

The documentation provided to the PM should tell them what to do when the system fails in the middle of a session, or
NBSC should advise.

If the PM took the money for the label although the stack hadn't / couldn't be settled, then he will have a gain.

This is not strictly speaking a transaction being lost, it has always been a fundamental part of the design that the
transaction is not written to the system for accounting purposes until the session is settled, at which point you have a set
of transactions including settlement which net to zero..

Dear Brian,

One of the witnesses in the Castleton case is Greg Booth who was the temporary sub-
postmaster at Marine Drive branch from 21 April to 28 May 2004. Greg is currently the
manager of the Newbury Post office branch, 401 Scalby Road, Scarborough, YO12 6TQ.

Greg spoke to me last week and reported that his computer froze on Wed 25 or Thurs 26
October 2006 (I will clarify which day) whilst he was serving a customer and part way through a
transaction. The transaction had not been settled. It related to a postage label. When he
logged back in again, the computer had lost the transaction of £1.27. The computer did

not prompt him to try to recover it. Greg is away this week, but I will be contacting him upon
his “urn to obtain a supplemental witness statement about this point. Prior to then, Greg's
eviacnce was that he had never know the system to lose a transaction. In this particular case,
Greg was £1.27 up because he had taken money from a customer. However, I anticipate the
reverse would have happened if he had been paying money out.

Although this is for a small amount, the principle on the face of it seems concerning because it
suggests that the Horizon system can, (albeit rarely), lose transactions. Castleton's solicitors
will try to exploit any weakness and we must be prepared for a possible attack on this point.
Our Counsel has requested that Fujitsu review the Newbury Post Office's Horizon data for those
days period to see if you can tell whether the system froze and lost the transaction and what
the explanation may be.

We have to serve Witness Statements very shortly. I will have to prepare a supplemental
Witness Statement for Greg Booth dealing with this and may possibly need to take a further

Witness Statement from somebody at Fujitsu, depending on your explanation. Accordingly, I
would be grateful if you could look into this and come back to me as a matter of urgency.

Kind regards.

Dear Mike,

Thanks for your email.

I am seeking immediate instructions on 2. and will revert to you very shortly.

In response to para 4. i.e whether the spmr was making mistakes in counting giros, the short
answer is no. This is dealt with in 5 of our witness statements that I sent to Geoff a few weeks
ago. (Also see my email of 3 November to you). See Paul Williamson (giro), Ken Crawley
(pension), Michael Johnson (lottery), Gillian Hoyland (cheques) and Wendy Smith (APS). There
were 15 error notices in 2003 to 2004, so he wasn't making significant errors.

If at any stage you have any queries, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Kind regards.

Stephen - I have looked through the papers sent. I haven't had a chance to read the statements etc.
Would you please note the following:

1. As I explained to you on the telephone - I am already in Court on 4 December. In addition, given
the short time frame we have - it would be better if Geoff Porter takes on this case as the expert.
Geoff has many years experience and is authorised by BDO to appear in Court and to act as the
expert. We operate a licensing system at BDO in respect of expert witness work and Geoff is
authorised. Geoff has also examined much of the documents.

2. Ihave costed the job and I believe this will cost between £25,000 to £30,000 excluding VAT and
disbursements. This includes reviewing the other sides report and meeting with the expert. This does
not include any Court attendance. If our costs are less than this (and they might be) - I will invoice
the lower cost. If it transpires that our costs are likely to exceed this I will advise you immediately
we realise this.

3. Geoff is on annual leave until this Thursday, but I can see that we very well might need to
investigate a number of matters not yet considered. Our computer expert has spotted a possible cause
of an error from the system documentation. Apparently the sub-postmaster is sent the cash for
pensions etc in a wallet that has a barcode and the cash figure gets into the branch accounting system

by scanning the barcode. We do not know if Castleton counted the cash or just accepted the barcode.
Its 1s possible for there to be errors in the cash that is sent to a branch. It might be worth getting
an independent report of what cash was sent from the regional cash office to Castleton each week.

4. When we looked at this originally I had thought about whether Castleton could have been making
mistakes in remittances out of the branch (e.g. does he make a mistake in counting cashed giros sent
to head office. The Post Office were rather vague about this, there is a comment by the auditor or
line manager to the effect that I asked Chesterfield and they said there were no significant
differences. It would be useful to have a contact in the Post Office who is able to check that there are
no errors (or to quantify any that were noticed).

Apart from this we seem to have all that we need. However, as we progress the report it is often the
case that other issues come to light. We will probably we asking for other documents as we carry out
our investigations. This cannot be avoided at this stage.

Can you please advise me whether the above is acceptable and I will then organise our standard
letter of engagement.

I had a telephone conversation with Richard Morgan in relation to Greg Booth’s Witness

wanted to amend paragraph 5 and also tweak paragraphs 6 and 7 and then ask what Greg
did next. Making the changes to the Statement.

Thereafter discussing the ... explanation with Richard ie. namely that on Sundays Mr
Castleton used two user ID‘s - this is mentioned in the Witness Statement either of Andrew
Rise or Anne Chambers and that this had the result of doubling up cash declarations. Also
explaining to Richard that I have the ... reports from Horizon listed for January but not
February or March and I needed to get those too.

Start time: Units:

I had a telephone conversation with Vicky Harrison.

She confirmed that the days in January where the figures don’t match are mornings and
evenings when Mr Castleton was using separate ID numbers. For example, on 8 January, he
did two cash declarations and that is why the figure is so high.

She also said there were certain figures in the spreadsheet she had sent to me in bold. They
are days when he didn’t make a proper declaration.

She also confirmed that Mr Castleton doesn’t have to print every declaration. He can merely
make it into the computer.

Finally, she will get her colleague, Steve, to do the same spreadsheet that she sent me for
January, for February and March 2004.

Thereafter asking her about the database and she said that the Post Office had to pay
Horizon for over a certain number of requests, they had to pay Fujitsu for access. Therefore
she didn’t think someone in the Post Office could have access to all of this. I hypostasised
that maybe they could, but they would just have to pay for it. In any event I can tell Mr
Castleton’s solicitors that Fujitsu have a database.
