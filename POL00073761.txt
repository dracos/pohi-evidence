Dear Andrew,
We are going to trial on this case tomorrow.

Please could you email to me (copying in the others to this email) any
documents that show how much Mr Castleton was paid plus a schedule of
payments? Janice Thompson may be able to assist.

I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible, ideally today.
Kind regards.

Responses below in relation to pay levels Mr Castleton had been generating.
To clarify Mr Castleton was suspended on 23rd March 04 so was paid during
wary, February & March. He was not paid following suspension so I would
ume his claim would relate to April, May & June 04.

Hope this is adequate information.

Re the questions from the solicitor.

1. Mr Castleton was not paid £3750.00 per month. His pay is related to the
transactions over the counter. For the 7 full monts he was paid his total
earnings were £23346.47, I have egnored the 2 part months, so an average
would be £3335,21

During his short time at the office his lowest gross pay was £3012.21 and the
highest £3732.37

2. The actual payment dates in 2004 were.
Friday 30th January
Friday 27th February
Wednesday 31st March

3. I would not say his loss of income was £11250.00.
If we were asked to calculate a payment it would be 3x £3335.21 = £10005.63

Hope this helps
Regards

- P.O -v- Castle

Dear Andrew,
I refer to our telephone conversation this morning.

As discussed, Mr Castleton has now reduced his counterclaim from not exceeding
£250,000 to 3 months loss of income as a subpostmaster i.e.

£3,750 x3 = £11,250 (on the basis that the P.O could terminate his contract
for any reason on 3 months notice).

The Court has ordered the P.O to put in a Reply to the Amended Counterclaim by
no later than Monday 13 November 2006 and we are gathering relevant
information. Please could you find out from personnel:

Was Castleton paid £3,750 per month?<?xml:namespace prefix = 0 ns =
"urn: schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" />
POL00073761
POL00073761

2. If so, when was he paid for January, February and March 2004?

3. Is it correct that his loss of income would be £3,750 x3 = £11,250?
I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.

Kind regards. .
