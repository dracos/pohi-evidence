All

Thank you for attending the meeting this afternoon to discuss the correspondence from Alan Bates. A short note of
the meeting is below and a revised draft response is attached. I would welcome comments on drafting, structure and
approach for the correspondence.

Many thanks

David

The ExCo sub committee met to discuss the slide pack circulated in advance.

Attendees: Chris Aujard, Chris Day, Neil Hayward, Belinda Crowe, Angela Van Den Bogerd, David Oliver and Martin
Edwards.

Apols: Mark Davies.
The Sub-committee recognised the seriousness of the breach of confidence by Alan Bates.

The Sub-committee reviewed the strategic options and agreed that option 6 (refer to Tony with a strong Post Office
position) was the appropriate course of action at this stage.

The Sub committee reviewed the tactical options and agreed that it would be best if a short reply issued from the
Minister/her office refering the letter to Paula Vennells and Tony Hooper. They also agreed that it was important that
Post Office made clear their dissatisfaction with Alan’s actions and that this was best done by a letter from Paula to
Alan (potentially copied to Tony).

The draft in the slide pack was discussed and various drafting comments were made. A revised draft is attached to
this email for comment.
