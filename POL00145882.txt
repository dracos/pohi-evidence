Dear everyone,

Susan and I talked about this work today.

I thought this paper was clear and helpful. I am also glad that on the basis of his conversation with Susan last
week, Alasdair Marnoch thought that the right immediate issues were being tackled in the right way at the right
speed.

Thad some thoughts which I want to put on the record about the way ahead.

First, while it is clear that we are committed to using SS for the 47 cases which are already in the frame for their
review, it is extremely important that we cap their involvement at that. The moment they are involved in
additional cases beyond these, we will have lost the ability to end the relationship with them - an outcome which
I do not want to have to contemplate. I understand that this means we have to find a way of satisfying James
POL00145882
POL00145882

Arbuthnot and the JFSA that we have a credible alternative way of handling additional cases. So the sooner we
can do this, the better.

Second, we need to pin down and cap SS's costs. I understand from Susan that she has told them that she is
expecting them to do the extra work pro bono but no deal has been done. I understand that Chris will be
bottoming this out urgently and that there will be a cap on any additional payments to them.

Third, we need a proper process for appointing the independent Chair of the working party. We cannot afford to
make the wrong choice here. We need to draw up a clear description of the role and the qualities we are looking
for and then interview some people who appear to fit the bill, and reference them properly (ie conversations not
bits of paper).

Finally, I have asked Susan to keep the Board fully informed of future developments and to alert me to anything
which she is unable to resolve which could get in the way of getting the job done in the way it needs to be done.
She will be seeking conversations about all this with all the NEDs on an individual basis and will be in touch with
you to arrange these.

Best wishes

Alice

Apologies all, it should have been this version of the note attached to yesterday's email, which incorporates the
insurance information (at paragraph 31) rather than leave that in a standalone note. It also includes a couple of
additional sentences on accounting arrangements at paragraph 24.

Thanks,
Martin

Thanks Alwen

For the benefit of the other Board members I had a very good review with Susan and Alwen earlier this week
focused mainly on the history and immediate actions we are taking to dealing with the urgent case review. I was
reassured by the energy, resource and prioritisation of the work we are doing and I think it's fair to say on this
we are working through as quickly as is practical.

In our discussion with Susan, Alwen explained why the case review was only going back to 2010 and the
significance of a Horizon upgrade (full reconciliations across every site etc). Could Alwen please elaborate on

this point as a critical issue will be determining how far back we need to go.

Also what's the legal position with Fujitsu - do we think they are in any way culpable (and have we had our view
verified) and have we taken any action (noting that they have offered to pay£100k in support of costs)?

Finally I seem to be missing the insurance update - could you please resend.
