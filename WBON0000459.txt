Completely separate side question (for which I hope there is a quick answer â€” fingers crossed!).

Have you come across something called "Peak Incident Reports"? I think these are some form of reporting tool used
by FJ to flag major issues. Do you know what they are and how they're used?

If not, don't worry. I thought I might try my luck with you before going to FJ.

Kind regards
Andy
