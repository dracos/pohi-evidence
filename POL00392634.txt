Tim

Apologies I was not able to stay on the call longer
I was on a remote Reserve in Africa and had to drive to the Airport to connect coming home

Anyway I understand we have a further call week of 18th to be scheduled

Outside of the call I old appreciate a private conversation with you on this topic and it would be great
if you could let me know what might suit

Best regards

Ken
