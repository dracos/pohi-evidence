Subject: Losses ~

My view on losses, which I think you know but:

From a cultural point of view we cannot start trying to take money off Postmasters until we have demonstrated
HJ/Data.

This means:
- Sorting out properly the use of the disputes button
- Delivering stock auto-rem
- Managing the other stamps button
- Investigating a high proportion of losses
- Getting investigations signed off
- Board decision that we can go to court

Thanks Al
