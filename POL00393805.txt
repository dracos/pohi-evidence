Business Service Management Service Reporting,

1.0 PURPOSE

The purpose of this report is to provide information regarding management of
the live environment and the effects of Horizon on individual business units.
The critical success factors (CSF’s) within the report are intended to highlight
the impacts on areas of key performance as defined by business units.

It is really about where we are ‘feeling, the pain’ - as historical data builds up
we will be able to analyse and report trends more effectively.

This report also contains performance statistics for the Horizon System
Helpdesk (HSH) and Network Business Support Centre (NBSC) to provide
visibility of potential problems. These will be analysed in relation to the CSF’s
to identify potential links, which in turn will feed into. the service
improvement process.

The Horizon Service Review Framework provides a basis for improvements
on Service failures to be progressed.

The graph above shows that although call volumes are continually increasing the level of average calls has decreased since March. The
level of average calls seems to be levelling off at about 1.3 calls per office per week. The drops in call volumes at the beginning and
end of may are caused by Bank Holidays.

orrices,

The decimal figures above show the percentage chances of an office phoning, on each category. For example : 0.01
‘would mean that there is a 1% chance that the office will be ringing on that topic ; whereas 0.43 would indicate that

there is a 43% chance that the office will be phoning on that category.

1m Advice and Guidance

From the graph it can be seen that the percentage of calls received within each category has been stable over the past
month, Only Software calls seemed to increase during the third week of June. This increase in software calls may have

been due to a “blue screen” on log-in. HSH reported that they received 320 calls in a timescale where they would

normally only expect 100.

The graph shows that the main area for concern is the rising number of people who had increasing,
difficulty contacting the helpline between February and May. The reason for the increase in people
failing to get through to HSH was due to the surge in calls at the end of April and beginning of
May regarding revaluation. This issue had been resolved by June hence the fall in complaints in
this category. Itis worth noting that June recorded the lowest complaints in this category since
records began earlier this year and this may well be linked to the introduction of IVR (Interactive
Voice Recognition) by HSH at the beginning of June.

OUTLET

The level of calls to Regional helplines has continued to fall as offices become automated and therefore phone the NBSC instead of their
regional helplines. Total calls over the last month have however remained fairly static despite the migration of some 300 outlets a week this
may suggest that some migrated outlets still phone their regional helpline instead of the NBSC. The average level of calls to the Regional

Helpdesk is around 1.5 calls per office per week. This is comparable to the average calls to the NBSC. (shown on the previous page).

Summary

Service Level Agreements (SLA’s) have currently not been met over the last 6 months.
The main areas for concern centre around calls answered within 60 seconds and the
longest waiting time before a call is either answered or abandoned.

The resolution rate over the last 6 months has averaged at 68.7% and therefore failing its
SLA of 75%. Improvement in this area is however progressive and figures for June show

that calls to resolution averaged at 70 for the month with the target beginning to be met
during the latter days of the month (see graph over page) .

- First tranche of staff in post to cope with the increased number of errors from Horizon offices. These staff were allocated to
individual teams for clearing the increased number of errors from Horizon offices.

Additional staff being picked up from June 2000 onwards from the external recruitment exercise.
- Although the length of the leaming curve used has increased to be up to 30 weeks after conversion, the latest forecast of extra

staff required this year are stil inline withthe original forecast. This is due to applying the improved average error clearance rates
acheived in TP over the last 6 months.

Comments

The main cause of the problem is that many tables on the Cash Account are not mandatory for completion and some postmasters are realising this
once the account has been printed, thus the information has not been captured.

Impact

m™ Extra resource needed to input data into the system.

® Client Information distorted if not completed.

= Postmasters pay impacted - knock on effect could be more challenges on remuneration to TP

Recent figures show a considerable improvement over earlier months.

Problem Management enables us to keep up to date with any problems or concerns
regarding the Horizon System. A problem is formed by a regular occurrence of a
similar incident which is then transferred to Problem Management from the Incident
Management team. Not all problems are included in this summary however details
are available on request.

A summary of PONU’s problem database at the end of April is shown in the table
below. This data is retrieved on a monthly basis by a problem manager and then
analysed by a member of the Operations Performance Team.

This issue has recently received high profile awareness; the following is a statement which outlines
the nature and scope of the problem and additionally the actions taken by Business Service
Management to resolve the situation.

ICL Pathway have a contracted Service Level Agreement to deliver all Automated Payment
transactions to Post Office Network by Day D (ie. no office should remain unpolled for a period of
time in excess of 3 days)..

Owing to the inability of certain ICL Pathway investigative and diagnostic processes to react quickly
enough to initial non-polling incidents, in a number of cases the length of time a specific office
remains unpolled has significantly exceeded the contracted SLA. In some instances, this has reached
the level whereby payments are not transmitted to clients who then issue the customer with a
reminder or, as in some cases, instigate disconnection procedures. The key root causes identified so
far are:

«BT faults. The largest percentage of polling failures are caused by problems in the BT ISDN
network . Pathway are working with Energis in this area.

* Problems cleared by gateway swaps and/or reboots. Analysis is being performed on fault
reports for gateway PCs which have been swapped out as a result of non-polling incidents.
Similar work is being carried out to ascertain why reboots can resolve polling failures.

ICL Pathway have enhanced their E2E process for managing non-polled offices, with a new version
of their process document being reviewed within PON. In addition ICL Pathway have been
actioned to identify technical contingencies to recover ‘trapped’ transactions at an outlet that has not
been polled longer than 3 core days. This includes the following:

‘* swapping processor/ removing to a centralised location to extract
‘* downloading to a laptop
© satellite links

From a PON perspective, Business Service Management has undertaken the task of investigating the
end to end solution including how data can be recovered out of offices and to the client in a
controlled manner, if feasibl.

Internal Account Management currently have 10 problems. Of these 95% are product

problems where, for example Client Managers are not conforming, to the OBC process i.e.

Non- completion of an OBC form, or not linking ‘Go Live’ date with the icon and stock

availability. Another reason may be that stock remittances are arriving in outlets prior to

being visible on the Horizon system.

7.0.Non conformance
Des Hansbury - Problem Management

7.1 Passwords
Issue:

Monitoring of requests for One Shot Passwords ( OSP ) has identified a significant level of
non conformance which if maintained will impact on resources in both POCL and ICLP.

Scale:

Each previous monitoring, exercise has shown the rate of growth of OSP requests
exceeding the rate of growth of the automated network. However, the latest exercise
shows the growth rate has stabilised at the level noted in last report (just over 300 per
week for a fully automated network ).

The changes made to call categories since then, together with further instructions issued to
call handlers, have improved the logging of calls so that we can now identify and exclude
‘a number of calls that previously would have been included in the figures. Excluding
these calls produces a full network request rate of about 250 per week. Nevertheless, the
adjusted figure still leaves a large discrepancy between NBSC and ICLP records. Further
changes are, therefore, still necessary to enable us to identify which calls are genuine OSP
requests.

Action:

The Incident Analysts will be liaising with Customer Management tier 1 admin. to obtain
agreement to the recording of HSH call reference numbers in the call log which will make
it much easier to segregate the requests that actually require an OSP for resolution.
Further investigation of a sample of the remaining calls can then be carried out to try to
establish the reasons for these calls; currently, the call handlers are only able to categorise
57% of calls with any confidence ( auditor requests - 25%, non conformance - 32% ). The
call descriptions suggest that a large percentage of the remaining calls may be due to user
error ( training issue ) or system problems rather than non conformance.

7.2 Girobank Postmaster’s Daily Records ( PDRs )

Issue:

Girobank have agreed a phased program to accept printed versions of the daily report
forms for Deposits (G4631 ) and Withdrawals (G4632) from all Horizon offices.
However, the continued acceptance of these forms is dependent on the level of errors

received at Girobank being, reduced. The errors largely relate to factors that prevent the
forms being read by Optical Character Recognition (OCR ) equipment.

Action:

The reports continue to be analysed to identily the poorest performing offices which are
then contacted by letter. Persistent poor performers are contacted by phone. However, it is
proving difficult to make progress with some of these offices because of the lack of specific
detail on the errors being made and the postmasters’ insistence that they are following the
instructions correctly. A possible explanation is that the errors in these cases relate to the
boldness of the print presented.

A decision on how bold the print needs to be in order to be read by the OCR equipment is
inevitably subjective in the absence of examples showing what is acceptable. To address
this issue a print quality guide is being developed. The PDRs are also being, redesigned to
remove the need for postmasters to make any alterations or entries.

A sudden escalation in Changes made in March were due to several local schemes
changing their price structures with the start of the new financial year . There were ,
however, a number of Operational Business Changes (OBC) process failures regarding,
ATP's.. This was down to a combination of reasons. One being, due to stock arriving in
outlets prior to being visible on the Horizon system. Hence the large number of Changes
and ATP’s in March. Another was Stock Centres agreeing, timescales but not adhering to
these.

Many of the ATP’s were withdrawn in April once the products were able to go through
the OBC process.

Each CSF has at least one measure attached to it. These are shown in blocks and
each block of measures are weighted at 100%. If all are equally important in the
block the 100% is divided across the block of measures. This system works well in
areas like OSG where there are distinct differences in the importance of each
measure. The traffic lights are then used to show the total of the weighting. For
example if a CSF has a number of low graded measures on red but the higher ones
are all on green this suggests that there are no major issues affecting the CSF and
therefore the overall traffic light for that CSF would be green. However in
Transaction Processing, all the CSF’s are equally important which means that if any
‘of the measures are adversely affected the impact is high on TP.
