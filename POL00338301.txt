ATM 100 Rollout

Mike Moores confirmed that BoI funding the full
project with cost recovery through commissions
doesn’t improve economics. Mike also advised
that the possibility of rates charges needs to
be made clear to agents.

Paula Vennells asked who will be having the
conversation with agents and requested for the
Network team to be involved where relationships
already exist.

Instruction was given to persuade agents where
possible, not to have an ATM installed. A target
of 50 installations was proposed by Gary Hockey-
Morley.

Approved.

ATM Business Rate Charge
Gary Hockey-Morley outlined that the case sets
out a request for the following four items:
e £100k legal costs to fight the case
e Continue to pay the charges until the
decision date
e POL to enforce contractual liability of
agents should we lose
e Do we recover charges paid from the agents?

Mike Moores commented that it would be better
supporting the agents behind the scenes; however
Hugh Flemington suggested that by switching the
payment process we could send a message that we
are not confident of winning.

Mike Moores queried who the case was against.
Hugh Flemington agreed to check whether it was
Bank of Ireland or subpostmasters. (Hugh has
since confirmed that POL are acting on behalf of
Bank of Ireland in the two cases going to LVAC
in November. BOI are the occupiers for rating
purposes)

It was agreed that as of now, agents need to be
made aware that they will be liable for costs
going forward should the case be lost.

Gary will update the committee on the outcome of
the case (November).

Supply Chain Vehicle Replacement

Keith Rann introduced the case and informed that
since sending the papers out, procurement have
advised Mercedes cannot be used as they won’t
sign up to the T&C’s.

Hugh Flemington suggested he would look into an
emergency procurement option but was doubtful.
Mercedes have been the only supplier for heavy
vehicles as not every supplier has the armour
ability. Therefore the request is now for 11
vehicles at £1.314m

Dave Smith asked if we can keep all the vehicles
running for another year. Keith advised that it
would create a significant risk due to high
probability of failure.

Dave stated that there is no trade off outlined
in the paper for running the vehicles for
another year. The expected additional costs,
risks and lost opportunity for running for one
more year needs to be clear in the paper.

Keith Rann agreed to update the case to include
this information so it can then be circulated
via email.

Dave advised he would then take the case to Moya
Greene for final approval.

Not approved.
