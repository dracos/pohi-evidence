Post Office Account User Access Guide

[oe]
FUJITSU FUJITSU RESTRICTED (COMMERCIAL IN
CONFIDENCE)

1 Introduction

This Post Office Account User Access Guide details how access is given to both physical and IT system
assets within the Post Office Account (hereafter referred to as POA) and Fujitsu supporting functions, and
is managed by a central point, namely the Cyber Security POA(CSPOA) Operations Team.

This document sets out how access to these assets shall be created, managed, removed and how these
requirements are reported and monitored. CSPOA controls the access to systems and any asset dedicated
to POA and receives reports from other functions within Fujitsu who provide a shared service to POA.

1.1 Purpose

This document establishes the controls that POA must meet to manage user access to its assets, based
on its contractual requirements, in particular those from Schedule A4 Legislation Policies and Standards:

4.1.2 Fujitsu Services shall be compliant with ISO 27001.

4.1.3 Security for the Services, HNG-X Development, Associated Change Development and
Equipment shall be managed and organised by Fujitsu Services in accordance with the CCD
entitled POA Information Security Policy” (SVM/SEC/POL/0003) as applicable and, ...the CCD
entitled “Security Management Service: Service Description” (SVM/SDMW/SD/0017).

4.1.4 Security Standards Fujitsu Services shall adhere to all parts applicable to the Fujitsu domain,
as defined in Section 2 Definitions of the CRD entitled “Community Information Security Policy for
Horizon” (SVM/SEC/POL/0005) and co-operate with Post Office to assist Post Office in complying
with this standard and requirement.

4.1.5 Data Security The confidentiality, integrity, availability, and completeness of data shall be
maintained throughout all storage, processes, and transmissions, including during periods of
Service Failure and recovery from Service Failure.

Fujitsu shall adhere to all applicable parts of the Fujitsu Legal Register for Information Security.

Controlling access to IT resources requires a combination of directive, preventive, detective, corrective,
and recovery controls that are used to manage hardware, software, operations, data, media, network
equipment, support systems, physical areas, and personnel. They involve both manual procedures and
technical controls on the IT system. The Fujitsu Europe Business Management System (EBMS) outlines
the processes to be followed to create, amend, and revoke Privileged Access for a given account. The
Fujitsu Corporate Procedures below follow EBMS.

All framework controls that POA is required to meet are detailed in full in the Fujitsu Europe Security
Policy Manual, which aligns to 1S027001:2013, and follows the applicable Fujitsu Europe Minimum
Security Controls Framework — Access Management.

2 User System Access
2.1 Pre-requisites for allocation and removal of Access

Prior to access being requested for POA specific assets, Fujitsu HR processes for joiners and movers onto
POA, shall be followed.

For Shared Services, Assignment Managers will apply for resources via Minato according to Fujitsu
corporate procedures.

Once employment has been confirmed, the appropriate security clearance is initiated and managed by
Fujitsu Group Security. If an existing employee, then clearance will already exist. Note that there is no POA
specific security clearance required.

Once the individual has been accepted into the role, the Assignment Manager can apply for access to the
support systems to be set-up and for Fujitsu Facilities management to provide physical access to relevant
locations for the role.

If the individual fails clearance, HR and the Line Manager will be notified, and the circumstances discussed
with the POA Security Governance Manager and Security Operations Manager to determine how to
proceed.

In addition, if an individual moves away from POA or leaves Fujitsu, the Fujitsu HR processes are to be
invoked by the individual's Line/Assignment Manager, and CSPOA notified, to ensure revocation of their
access from all POA specific assets.

For those individuals who are leaving Fujitsu Services completely, the Line/Assignment Manager must
follow HR policies and procedures for a termination. These can be found on AskHR.

All 3° party access also follows the guidance detailed in this document.

2.2 CSPOA User Database

The User Access Process on the POA is based on the creation and maintenance of a User Access
Database (Secure and Restricted access) of all personnel who work on POA.

This database is controlled by CSPOA and is maintained and updated in line with requests being submitted.
It tracks all personnel working on POA, details of the requestor, the system access they have been given,
dates access was granted and revoked and any security access level they have been granted. It is also
subject to a monthly review as described in section 5.1.

The database also aids any audit that may be required, by providing the details of personnel and access
levels granted.

Below is an example from the User Access Database (with redactions as necessary) showing the system
access granted to the user. Other tabs (Events, Security Info, Floor Access, MSAD and Network Drives)
will show any additional system access and security access.

2.3. Privileged Access Management (PAM)

Some specialist support staff require Privileged Access to be able to keep systems working, investigate
issues, and make necessary and required updates. Such access relies on PAM processes.

A privileged account has additional abilities to a "standard" user account and may include access rights
to operating systems or to application software and databases.

System privileges and levels of access required to perform management functions are higher than those
assigned to standard users. Therefore, the allocation and use of privileges is restricted and controlled,
and the principle of least privilege is used. The principle of least privilege refers to the concept and
practice of restricting access rights to only those resources required to perform the authorised activities
Individuals are not granted unnecessary privileges.

The management of PAM accounts is completed using a variety of tools such as an Access database,
Excel spreadsheets, email, and SharePoint. A central database is held which records all access across
all environments.

Privileged Access is reviewed monthly as explained in Section 5.1.2 below.

The Fujitsu Europe Business Management System (EBMS) provides a process and work instruction that
POA follows:

The following steps must be followed:

1. The Assignment Manager shall complete the latest New User Access Form from the POA Security
Operations Portal with all required information. The completed form shall be returned to CSPOA via
email to CSPOA.Security; }
Privileged Access request: from either a Fujitsu or POL email address. All access follows
least privilege and role-based principles as outlined in Fujitsu EBMS.

Where a New User form has been completed by or on behalf of a new user (by a person other than the
Line/Assignment Manager), the Line/Assignment Manager must be copied in on the email request for
awareness and authorisation.

Below is an example of the email CSPOA receive for an individual who has joined the POA (with
redactions as necessary):

veh ose MMMM eh san

2. CSPOA shall check the form to ensure that it has been completed correctly. If any information is missing
or incorrect, the form will be rejected and returned to the Line/Assignment Manager for amendment.

e A “Start Date” will be stated on the New User Access Form. However, CSPOA may receive a
completed form weeks in advance of the stated start date. In that case, CSPOA shall retain the form
and set an Outlook reminder to not process the access request until a maximum of one week prior
to the requested start date.

e Some requests may be time bound. If that is the case, then CSPOA will set an Outlook reminder to
action the “Leaver” activity at the agreed date/time.

3. CSPOA shall email the new starter to:

e Inform them that their personal data (name and personnel number) may be shared with POL in
accordance with our obligations.

e Seek acknowledgement, and agreement for their Name and Personnel number to be supplied to
POL.

This is a GDPR compliance requirement and access to POA systems cannot be granted without this
agreement.

4. If privileged access is being requested, CSPOA will seek additional authorisation from a member of the
POA Leadership Team (LT) or a second member of the LT if the Assignment Manager is already a
member of the LT (introduced March 2023).

5. Once the correct New User Access Form, the GDPR agreement, and any required additional LT
approvals have been received, CSPOA shall arrange for all relevant access to be set up for the user.

6. CSPOA shall e-mail (generated from the user management database) the relevant System Owners and
request user access to be set up. A TfSNow call will be raised for back-end system requirements and a
copy of the completed request form will be attached to the TfSNow call, where required. In addition,
POL Jira ticket(s) will be raised for Post Office Cloud access, where required.

NOTE - System Owners must only make changes to User accounts when instructed to do so by CSPOA.

POA SecOps will share the SVM/SEC/POL/4538 POA Privileged Account Policy (Sections 5.2, 5.3 & 5.4)
with the Account Owner. This states the policy compliance requirements that must be met for the
account. The Account Owner will be asked to confirm their acceptance of the policy before the account is
authorised for creation. The Account Owner will also be required to acknowledge that compliance with
the policies will need verifying quarterly.

POA SecOps will also ask the LTO to provide additional authorisation if a human account. If the LTO is
not available, then POA SecOps will redirect the request to another member of the LT. Without LTO
authorisation the new account will NOT be created.

4.6.2 Adding access and controls

Upon review of the form and confirmation of authorisation by Account Owner and Assignment Manager,
POA SecOps will request the new account creation by raising a TfSnow Incident and assigning it to the
relevant system administrators. If the system administrators do not use TfSNow, then an Incident will be
raised and updated by SecOps to ensure TfSNow has a record of the actions taken. The TfSNow
Incident will remain open until the account is created and the PAM register has been updated in full.

4.6.3 Updating the PAM Register

All new privileged accounts are recorded on the PAM register Database and owners are contacted every
90 or 365 days (depending on level of privilege the account holds) to verify the compliance of the account
with the POA Privileged Account Policy.

5 Management

All access is validated monthly to ensure that the access supplied is still required and appropriate, including
standard user access for all POA systems and privileged user access for the Production environment.
Access is revoked if:

¢ Verification of the continued need for access is not received
e Role has changed and access is no longer appropriate or required
e User account has not been used for more than 90 days

Key steps within this User Access Procedure are reviewed, reported, and audited to ensure that it is
functioning effectively and efficiently. Below are the details of how this is achieved.

5.1 Review

The POA User Management and CSPOA Teams shall undertake a monthly review of the access granted
to individuals and its continued appropriateness.

5.1.1. Team Verification (Standard User Access Verification)

1. POA User Management Team shall produce details of all users contained in the register and their
access levels and shall email these to the relevant Line/Assignment Managers.

2. Line/Assignment Managers shall review whether the current access of their employees is still in line
with their job role.

3. Line/Assignment Managers shall consider whether any users require their access be amended and they
shall email these details to POA User Management Team within 15 working days of receipt of the
original e-mail.

4. Line Mangers shall confirm each employee's current access rights requirements and shall email these
details to POA User Management Team within 15 working days of receipt of the original e-mail from
POA User Management Team. If a response has not been received by POA User Management Team
within 15 working days, CSPOA will be informed, and users’ access may be removed

5. CSPOA will audit access rights and roles with each functional area; the results of which will be presented
at the monthly Team Access Review meeting with POA User Management.

Below is an example of the Team Verification email and the System Access Report (user access levels,
