GROUP LITIGATION UPDATE — HORIZON JUDGMENT

You'll have seen the communications today about a High Court Judgment in the Post Office
Group Litigation.

This Judgment, which focuses on our Horizon system, forms part of the preliminary stages in
this extremely complex litigation. It raises a number of issues [and criticisms] which could
cause concern,

Comprehensive communications being deployed across the business, including of course to
everyone in the network. We have also issued a media statement and you can find that,
together with further information on our intranet [link].

It is possible of course that customers might ask questions about it.
If we do get queries, we can reassure our customers :

- The products and services that Post Offices provide are not affected by the litigation

- We can be confident that overall Horizon is robust, comparing well with systems
used by other retail and financial services companies every day — this was confirmed
by both independent experts in the litigation

- Horizon processes around 47 million transactions a week, more than £60 billion
worth a year. These are reconciled every day, every month, every year with the
systems of major organisations including high street banks, utility companies and
Government departments

- Horizon’s performance is continually monitored and we continue to work hard to
make improvements wherever we can
