Dear Anne,

I refer to our email exchange yesterday and attach an amended version of the witness statement for your
approval, together with the exhibit.

Please could you read the witness statement very carefully, make sure that you are completely happy with
what it says, make any changes you feel are appropriate and then sign, date and return it to me.

I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible. Please note that I will be out of the office from 15
to 22 September inclusive.

Kind regards.
