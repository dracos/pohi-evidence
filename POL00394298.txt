exercise as a matter of priority. Briefly, S50 will be completed using
video benchmarking techniques using the same system

exploring the use of automated tools and system interaction to
provide more accurate samples in the future — any changes will of

comments regarding loss of

inappropriate calls to HSH.

24/10: FS are still monitoring network calls which have been more
stable in Sept than August. The main issue being system freezes
which are covered by AP230907.

LT asked what activity was being undertaken to address the
inappropriate calls relating to Network Failures. RB confirmed that
3 screen messages were to be rephrased.

17/10: Network connectivity issues generating HSH calls is being
monitored and updates have been included within the September
SRB.

23/09: LT asked that FS continue to monitor the situation and to
update at the next HSRF.

15/09/03: With the exception of the satellite site connectivity which is
the subject of a cross domain problem and appears now to be
resolved, NWB connectivity loss throughout the rest of the estate is
attributable to comms problems which before, would have remained un-
noticed by the PM. We have asked for a review of all NWB screen
messages with a view to making them clearer, more meaningful etc. An
analysis is included in the August SRB

September meeting.

16 Sept DH/RB

24/10: Labels testing is planned for Nov. It was agreed that POL
would need to consult with FS offline to ensure that testing covers
all required scenarios.

DH stated that the amount of failures is very small

RB stated that the cost of the failures was high but agreed that DH
was right about the small amount.

MR asked if POL were still treating this as a problem

DH stressed that testing is planned to identify the root cause and
that POL are not backing out. The delay is because the
independent tester is not available until Nov.

BD asked if the testing would be done using kit on the counter as
she felt from experience that the printers were dirty/dusty.
LT stated that, based on experience at the counter, she found that
if the power on the printer were switched off and then on again, it
worked OK. LT stated that this did not result in calls to HSH.
17/10: FS tested label currently with Graham Illing for comparison

Issues arising from the Service Report

Noted RH stated that she was much happier with the style of the All
SRB compared to previous months.

Call volumes were discussed as part of the management
summary. It was agreed that there was a risk that the call
volumes would be consistently over the limit.

LT stated that whilst FS had managed to maintain the level
of service to date this may become an issue.

RB confirmed that the HSH do struggle on Monday
mornings to maintain the service

Noted When discussing OBC, it was noted that all the stops were All
pulled out to manage BT for the Tory conference.

LT asked whether Fujitsu had a response from POL
regarding the 2 H&S issues

RB confirmed that he is now happy that both issues have
been resolved to his satisfaction.

When discussing complaints, LT asked if we were going in
circles in terms of reporting complaints and did it require
intervention again.

RB stated that this was currently being addressed.

When looking at the vital statistics on page 14 of the SRB, All
LT noticed that the average debit card refunds is much
higher than the average payments and questioned whether
this was right.

Agreed

RB stated that screen freezes and the level of
inappropriate calls were not accounted for when
forecasting call profiles. RB stated that the network calls
are also higher than anticipated.

BO ensured that all work ongoing to address the call
volumes was shared amongst POL and FS.

Work has been done to address the issue of sub-
postmaster selecting the wrong option at NBSC however
the impact this work has had will not be seen until
October’s SRB at the earliest.

It was noted that the changes to messages on Horizon may
also have an impact.

It was agreed that there should be one call reduction plan
to be shared between POL and FS and to be updated
fortnightly.

BO confirmed that there is now only 1 generic problem
relating to the call volumes, the only other problem to be
kept open in this area is the one regarding mails labels.

BO passed a copy of the call reduction plan around the
table.

LT asked what areas would be tackled first as part of the
call reduction plan.

BO confirmed that the big win areas would be tackled first
followed by any quick fixes.

BO stated that the potential reductions quoted in the call
reduction plan were more a gut feel of both POL and FS
rather than scientific calculations

MR noted that if all the activities in the plan come to fruition
we could expect to see a reduction of 2000 to 3000 calls

LT stated that the volume of calls regarding OKI printers
showed a massive increase (page 18) and asked if
instructions on how to use the printers were issued with the
equipment, and if so could they be re-issued. RB stated
that they were subject to copywrite but could go to
branches.

It was noted that there are over 15 000 OKI printers in the
estate and that the current calls may be lifecycle based.

discussed.

It was noted that the issue around the length of time taken
for the initial smartpost transaction of the day could have

LT confirmed that the NB SLA’s would be invoked 6
months from when we hit 2 million transactions in any

happen by the end of October 2003

It was confirmed that the phase 2 notice had been given

RH stated that it was a disappointing position for POL to be
in, in respect of the gap in planned to actual banking
volumes

MR asked what the reasons were for the slow progress with
NB.

RH briefly explained the main issues: -

The length of the Card Account opening process being far
too long and the focus of our network on getting the
applications right due to pressure on the govt as opposed
to encouraging new banking customers and sales.

The good news is that we are now working to sensible
forecasts as we have seen sufficient volumes to allow for
accurate forecasting

MR asked if this information was getting fed to the Capacity
functions in both organisations.

LT confirmed that the POL capacity manager produces the
report and that he is in regular contact with his equivalent in
FS with monthly Capacity ORF’s.

Held on: 24 October 2003

Noted RH stated that she felt that there was an element of
‘fudging’ scores as the relationship between POL and FS is
good but in some instances activities have been poor and
this disparity cannot be seen in the single scorecard.

MR suggested that if the scorecard doesn’t work as it is, we
should consider ditching it or changing it.

RH confirmed that it should be changed.

LT suggested that we attempt to score relationships and
outputs separately but produce a final score with a possible
weighting attached.

come through the POL route.

AP241009 NS took an action to look at what the commercial scorecard NS 24/11/03
focuses on and to confirm any directives about what we
need to have on our scorecard.

RB stated that there were no issues to discuss on the FS
scorecard for POL

BO queried a comment on the scorecard regarding IVR
messages as she thought that some pre recorded generic
messages were in place.

RB confirmed that BO was correct but the message in
question related to the issue of an MBS and required a
more specific level of detail and took some time to get in
place.

Issues arising for the Technical Workshop

Noted

DH gave a brief update of the results from the technical
workshop held on 7" October.
The attendees: -

Dave Hulbert

Richard Ashcroft

Torstein Godeseth

Bob Booth

Peter Burden

Tony Wicks and some others from TDA

The group talked through the number of service outages
and identified what happened and why it happened

PB produced some corrective actions as a result and has
agreed to update on actions on a weekly basis.

DH stated that he was concerned about the level of detail
and perceived lack of urgency of actions. He stated that
POL were looking for decisive actions and that a more
open dialogue with more detail and a clear understanding.
That way POL could see where they could help to move
things along.

PB and DH agreed to take this offline to progress the issue.

MR stated that a lack of urgency certainly was not the case
and that activities have been set in motion to address the
main issues: -

Faults with the service

Improvements to processes etc

Changes to monitoring of network

LT stated that prior to investigating changes in terms of
monitoring, there needed to be a common agreement on
what was originally provided for in the contract.

LT noted that this tied into the actions taken by MR and
Pete Jeram from the top team working together meeting. It
was agreed that the HSMF should be updated against
these actions and used as a sounding board prior to going
to the Joint Executive Forum.

It was agreed that there is a lack of understanding of the
risks to the online service within some parts of POL

It was noted that FS would be unsure who to speak to as
part of the escalation process.

RH confirmed that NS take all the responsibility for Service
Management whilst Alan Barrie will take on the
responsibility for commercial arrangements.

MR asked further questions regarding the POL structure
and where responsibilities lie.

RH took an action to discuss the ambiguity in the
organisation with Mike Wells to feed into his action from the
top team working together meeting.
