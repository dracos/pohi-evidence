The attached paper incorporates the many changes that have been
suggested including more explicit meeting schedules and (hopefully)
confirmed attendees for the many meetings. I am not sure that I have
been able to reach all those affected. It will be helpful if you could
check that averyone who needs a copy of the paper in your respective
areas sees a copy.

Regards. Richard.
