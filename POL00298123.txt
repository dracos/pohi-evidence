I Can deal with point 4 as follow.

4.CK have and are carrying out the same review on Scottish and Irish cases .

In Scotland the Procurator Fiscals office makes all prosecution decisions on post Office investigations. POL has
recently retained a Scottish firm Brechin Tindal Oatts who advice on sufficiency of evidence and Public interest before
cases are referred to PSO. Ck have made contact with PSO via BTO.

In Northern Ireland the office of the director of the Public Prosecution service makes all prosecution decisions on all
POL prosecutions. Only very recently in NI, POL has instructed Ernie Waterworth of Maccartan Turkington Breen to
advise and assist the investigations officer his investigations in NI.

The rest of the points raised by you and Brian we need to initially discuss with Susan.

In the meantime I’m happy to discuss or assist.

I have now had the chance to review Brian Altman's Interim Review of CK's Current Process and set out below
my/Simon's comments and suggestions for future action:

1. It is clearly good news that the current limited process CK have adopted is broadly fine.

2. He raises the issue of whether the current review is too narrow (paragraphs 11,12 and 13) — he references the
list of issues in the SS report and Spot Review 22 as examples of other issues which may need to fall within
the ambit of CK's review. Whilst this should be put to CK, my own view is that it may be very difficult for CK to
expand the review on issues on which SS have failed to come to any conclusion.

3. The possible conflict issue is well made and CK need to be alive to it

4. The points he raises about the geographical and temporal limits of the review need to be answered — what is
the position in Scotland and N Ireland? Does a 3 year review suffice?

Other than these issues, his interim recommendations at paragraph 24 are all self-explanatory.
Our advice is:

1.POL legal needs to disclose Brian Altman's Interim Review to CK and discuss it with them.

2. CK should be asked to respond in writing to the recommendations made at Paragraph 24 and Paragraph 15

3. Bond Dickinson (Andy Parsons) should sit down with Brian Altman to walk him through the spot review process and
the SS Report so that he can understand the impact of his review on the civil side

Happy to discuss taking the above points forward.

Gavin was away on Friday and will come back to you during Monday. Brian Altman is away but that gives you time to
discuss with Gavin, and internally, the terms of reference. I'll feed my comments into Gavin once I've reviewed the
attachments.
