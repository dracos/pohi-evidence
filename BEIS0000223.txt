POST OFFICE: VARIOUS ISSUES
Horizon

You will be pleased to learn that after some fairly tense final stages both
POCL and ICL have accepted that the problem of data corruption has
now been solved to the satisfaction of both sides. As a result the Horizon
roll-out programme will resume on the planned date of 24 January. The
roll-out will build to a “beat-rate” of some 300 offices a week needed to
ensure that every counter position at every post office in the land is
equipped with the Horizon platform by the scheduled end date of Spring
2001.

Horizon Working Group

I do not see anything in the revised version of the CWU / CMA / NFSP
letter to require changes to the draft response you already have. We will
hold off arranging a next meeting of the Working Group until Simon

briefly the unfortunate timing coincidences of the ballot on the “way

decision as a cynical reprisal if the ballot goes against them). You
concluded that the scenario was perhaps not quite as bleak as it first
appeared since traditionally the largest number of votes in the ballot
would be cast within the first few days of its opening; and that there was
anyway little we could do about the timing.
