Subject: Horizon judgement

Ben

I’ve been through a fair bit of the judgement. Although the conclusion is helpful in relation to the system as it
operates today, as predicted, it’s again highly critical and makes some very damaging findings.

Presumably POL will be making a statement when the judgement is handed down. Obviously a lot hinges on the
outcome of the mediation but I’d suggest it would be useful to see drafts assuming different scenarios as soon as
something can be prepared.
