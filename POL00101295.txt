I have spoken to Brunswick and subsequently to Mark. I have added in the word ‘publicly’.
The line is:

it is unfortunate that this Report, prepared for the mediation scheme, has been leaked when it was marked confidential.
This cannot be in the interest of those applicants who have applied to the Scheme and for that reason we will not be
commenting publicly on what is a leaked document.

Best wishes

Belinda

No problem Mark. Do we have a pre-existing contact with Brunswick who is familiar with this topic?

I'm happy with the line and agree about not using the square brackets. Cathal you could however
provide strictly off the record guidance that we recognise the words in the accompanying letter? Are
you comfortable with that?

Yes please do run by Brunswick.

Being highly pendantic can we start it "It is" rather than “it's".

Thanks

Mark

As discussed. Our lines, well rehearsed are:

it's unfortunate that this Report, prepared for the mediation scheme, has been leaked
when it was marked confidential. This cannot be in the interest of those applicants wha
have applied to the Scheme and for that reason we will not be commenting on what is a
leaked document.

[You say you have seen the Post Office document setting out our position and we can
confirm that it is accurate.]

The bit is square brackets needs thought as both documents (the Report and our
response) are marked confidential and if we comment on one we undermine our

position in relation to commenting on the other.

Do you want to run this past Brunswick?

Hi Belinda,

We have the below pressing enquiry from BBC Look North and I was hoping you could
help in Ruth, Mel and Nina's absence.

Do you have the latest external Q&As and statement on this? I have the following which
could be used if appropriate but would appreciate a steer from you.

A report into the Horizon system produced in July 2013 found that there were no
systemic issues with the Horizon system. However, it did find that improvements could
be made in the training and support processes provided to postmasters.

We acted quickly to review how we train and support our postmasters and have
already made improvements to the induction training approach and the ongoing
support we offer to postmasters. We also put in place a business improvements
programme to determine how we can better provide effective and efficient support to
postmasters on an ongoing basis.

Thanks,

Cathal

Hello,

I'm a reporter from BBC Look North and I'm doing
a report on the findings of the briefing report part
two prepared by Second Sight.

It carried out the Independent investigation into
matters raised by 150 Subpostmasters, or former
Subpostmasters, with particular regard to the
Horizon computer system.

It is highly critical of the Post Office and says
there were faults with the Horizon computer
system and highlights a number of problems..

The money from the post offices cash and lottery
machines didn't match the figure on the computer
system.

In some branches the system recorded the sale
of a 12 month tax disc - when a 6 month one was
sold.

Some sub postmasters said the training was
insufficient and the helpline was unhelpful.

The report said some of the computer hardware
was old.

Post Office Investigators - it said - seemed more
keen on seeking a charge for false accounting
rather than investigating the route course of the
suspected problems.

POL-0100878

They disregarded the possibility that the
Horizon's computer system could've been at
fault.

For some of the people who used it - the system
was not fit for purpose.

I'm not seeking an explanation for every single
point raised, just a reaction from the company to
Second Sight's report.

I've also seen documentation from the Post
Office which says.." the report by Second Sight is
not endorsed by Post Office. The Post Office
believes that the report is inaccurate in important
areas and that there is no clear statement of the
evidence upon which many of the opinions
expressed in the report are based.”

I was wanting to check if that was in fact the
company's position.

The report is being put together today and will be
broadcast on Monday morning.

I would need a response at the very latest by
5pm toady.

An interview would be best, but I'd be happy with
a statement - if that was all that was available.

Thanks very much for your time.

Please shout if you have any questions.
