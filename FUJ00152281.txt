1 MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

Within the Fujitsu Services domain for Jan 08 there were no Major Incidents and 3 service-affecting incidents, 2
incidents relating to VIP sites and 1 further service-affecting incident outside the Fujitsu domain, detailed in the
incident overview below.

Branch and counter availability continue to remain above target at 99.80% and 99.50% respectively. The pilot of
the revised Engineering service targets has continued, and has seen improvements in all areas from December,
despite the challenges faced with incidents with Triole For Service and the OTI links. These issues have now
been resolved and service on TFS has been stable for a number of weeks. The focus remains on improving the
Response times, which will enable the overall fix times to meet target.

194 OBC changes were delivered in the month, with no failures.
There were no failures on Post Shops in January.

The helpdesk Service Level Targets that failed in December, calls answered within 30 seconds and calls not
answered, have had normal service restored in January with both achieving above target performance. The first
five new agents are now trained and working on the desk. There is still recruitment and training under way to
deploy a further 6 to make up the remaining shortfall.

The overall number of complaints logged with NBSC has decreased in January. Fujitsu Services complaints
owner and Post Office Limited complaints owner have met to re-instigate the full review process agreed in May
2007 and as such we will expect the dashboard to show an increased number of complaints going forward. This
process is now working, with Fujitsu Services investigating all complaints passed to them, whether “for
information only” or not. This will allow greater focus on areas that require improvement.

No branches failed the Day J targets.

Significant activities from the Service Improvement Plan are included in this review book. A number of the
branch improvements have been in pilot and demonstrated positive results, and these will be rolled out in
agreement with POL over the coming weeks.

Fujitsu Engineers are now replacing the Master Line Box face plate, which has enabled us to resolve a number
of calls which previously required Post Office Limited intervention with BT. This is expected to provide significant
cost savings in this area.

2 Incident Overview

Summary: Within the Fujitsu Services domain for January 2008, there were no Major Incidents.
There was 3 further service affecting incident within the Fujitsu domain.

There were 2 incidents affecting VIP sites.

There was 1 further service affecting incidents outside of the Fujitsu domain

Major Incidents: None
Other incidents in Fujitsu Thursday 3” January. An IP stream failure occurred, affecting up to 190 branches
Services domain: from 13:35 to 15:45. The incident was due to a BT ATM node at Ealing. Investigations

undertaken by BT supplier Alcatel and node reset. Service restored to all branches by
15:45. Call 89854 refers

Monday 7" January. A loss of the APOP web service occurred from 14:13 to 15:15
due to the incorrect application of a Release Note during normal operational hours to
the APOP database. Corrective actions now in place by Release Management to
ensure verification of the install time is correct and no release to the “Live” service
during the operational day. Calls 92416, 92461 & 92476 refer.

Thursday 24" January. The PAF service was experiencing an occasional
degradation of the service. The problem was first identified on the 24" when
the PAF servers were re-loaded by Tivoli. The PAF service suffered a dip in
performance on 28th. This was followed by further degradation at 15.09 hrs
on 29th and later appeared to freeze. This resulted in the PAF service being
unavailable at 16 20 to 16:24 to all branch counters for 4 minutes. There have
been continuing daily conference calls monitoring and corrective actions
taken. A report has been generated and daily updates are being provided to
POL. Call 108737 refers

VIP sites affected this month: Thursday 3" January. VIP site Hartlepool 011327 Loss of On-line services from
08:30 to 10:00. Gateway replaced. Call 89025 refers

Wednesday 16" January. VIP site Antrim 004702, lost on-line services at 10:31, as
ADSL circuit became intermittent. It took awhile to switch over to the ISDN back up
service. On line services were restored at 11:02 on the ISDN back up. ADSL service
restored on Friday, problem believed to be with BT who lost ADSL service over a wide
area. Call 10094 refers

Incidents that were outside Monday 14" January. Link failures were noted on the “B” Link to Wigan for 7

the Fujitsu Domain: minutes, from 14:13 to 14:19. There were 1107 failures within 1320, a failure rate of
84%. Networks investigated and could see no failures reported at the firewall level.
SSC investigated from an Agent perspective, and there were no agent failures, but
the agent had noted the PI! errors. Can only assume the incident was due to an
incident on the WAN owned by Link, although Link initially reported no failures seen
by them. Call 99086 refers.

Top 3 Areas of Complaints forwarded to Fujitsu Services

Engineer Complaints

There were 12 complaints which were considered to be justified in January. The majority of these complaints
were caused by engineering delays in getting to site within SLA. This issue is being addressed both within
Engineering and HSD to ensure that calls are attended within SLA and that Post Masters are kept better
informed of ETAs.

HSD Complaints

There were 3 justified complaints about HSD. These complaints were due to agents not following the correct
resolution procedure and hence not picking up faults which could have been resolved over the phone, rather
than requiring an engineer visit. These agents have had reminders of the correct fault resolution process. The
unjustified complaint was about SLAs.

Online Services Complaints

There were no justified complaints made about online services in January. Both unjustified complaints were due
to online services being impacted by line ceases.

5 Service Summary

5.1 Horizon Service Desk

January saw an increase in all call categories compared with December. In particular, Hardware call volumes
increased by approximately 400 calls, Network by 300, and Software by 150 calls. The volume of Inappropriate
calls increased by 500, an increase of over 50% on the previous month. It is believed that the high volume of
Inappropriate calls is caused by multiple Inappropriate calls from individual sites, and these sites are being
tracked in order to pass this information to Post Office Limited for investigation and education. It is also possible
that if PMs are unable to get through to the NBSC, they believe that they can be put straight through by HSD.

This potential cause is being investigated.

These calls are logged by SMC, OBC or others. Branches are not negatively affected by this proactive work.

The increase in non-branch logged Change calls is the result of OBC engineering visits for ISDN to ADSL
migration fault detection, as well as OBC engineers attending “Core” sites during the tail end of the Epson
printer project. There has also been an increase in SMC-coded calls, which is in line with annual trends

5.2 Engineering Service

January saw a general increase in the number of calls logged, although this was in line with annual trends.
There was a total of 695 A priority calls logged during this period, and there was an improvement across all
SLT measures during January.

January saw a number of issues relating to the OTI and Triole for Service systems, and having to revert to
manual processes caused a certain level of desk inefficiency. Fixes to the systems have been implemented
where possible.

We carried a high number of calls into January which directly affected our ability to meet our SLTs. These
calls were taken into the month due to resource challenges both in the field and on the desk.

Call volumes, as expected, increased in line with annual trends. January saw a significant increase in A
priority calls (400 Peripheral and 400 Base Unit) which required additional focus and additional desk
intervention. This challenge meant that engineers were diverted more frequently in order to attend high
priority calls and subsequently did not attain the same productivity levels as in previous months.

The table below shows our conformance levels following the fourth month of the trial.

The engineering desk has undergone a personnel refresh and restructure, and Fujitsu continues to deliver
training presentations to new starters. The MAC desk now proactively chase the engineering desk for VIP
branch-logged calls to ensure that focus is optimised.

An off site build was performed for Stockbridge Post Office (217824) with the help of St James Crown
Office. Leven Outreach was provided with a free upgrade in communications service type to resolve an
ongoing issue.

Work on the CTO Pin Pad rig was completed, and we worked closely with POL to ensure that a number of
CTO non SLA incidents were attended during January, fitting in with POL training schedules.

5.3 Branch Network Services / Central Network

5.3.1 Branch Network Services

During January 1062 were calls logged across all Network Types into the HSD.

In total 44 calls failed to hit the 4 hour priority SLA, resulting in 95.9% SLT conformance. 85% of these failed
calls failed as the result of delays at HSD or the Engineering desk. This emphasizes the need for us to continue
to bridge the gap between the two teams.

The Branch Network Services Troubleshooting Guide is nearing completion and now incorporates several other
process documents in order to allow engineers to diagnose faults more accurately when attending a site.
Ultimately this will drive down the number of repeat engineer visits and will help to reduce the average age of an
Online Services call.

The ISDN to ISDN2e roll out commenced during January and, through proactive management between Cable
and Wireless, BT and CMT, we suffered no significant impact to service and the roll out is considered to have
been a success.

After analysing problematic calls, we have implemented a service improvement in which a BIM visit is combined
with a BT SFI visit. This joint visit allows for a speedier identification of faults, which leads to a reduced
resolution time. Recent examples of the success of these visits can be noted in cases such as Maple Cross and
Cemetery Road in Barnsley, where we were able to either identify or even resolve the fault during the joint visit.
Going forward, we expect this practice to reduce both call age and call volume.

As a result of measuring the GSM usage over the previous month, we picked up an action to recover GSM
modems from branches which have not returned them following on line services being restored. The GSM
recovery process will shortly be reviewed in order for it to become more proactive. A sweep of all branches
currently showing as having GSM modems is underway to ensure that those which are still in the field are in fact
in use.

The BT referral process is now in use at the CMT desk, which has enabled us to progress a number of incidents
more efficiently, which in turn reduces call duration. The NTE2000 faceplates have now been distributed to
engineers who have been given training. This has allowed us to retrieve a number of calls previously referred to
POL. We are currently monitoring the use of these faceplates in order to measure the effectiveness of this
service improvement.

5.3.2 Central Network

The Access Layers for ADSL (IP Stream), ISDN (Metered) and VSAT branches remained extremely stable
during December. The ATM node incident at Ealing affected multiple BT Wholesale broadband customers and
was in line with the expected characteristics of BT Wholesale’s network design.

On the EDG2 D/R we are awaiting the results of the ‘Zinc Whiskers’ testing being performed by CSC before
they will allow the server into their Maidstone datacentre. Once complete the remainder of FTMS based AP
Clients (ISDN and Leased Line) can be migrated to EDG in preparation for HNG.

5.6 Data Centre Operations Service / Data File Transfer

The LFS Planned Orders file was impacted by a batch schedule failure in the Prism domain. The inbound file
from SAPADS was not received until 10:42 (usual time approx 03:00) which delayed the delivery of files to
branches. TfS call 116567 refers.

5.6.1 Day J Failures

There were no Day J failures in January.

There were 47 reconciliation incidents cleared during January. This is 18 more than that reported in December.
There were 4 priority incidents cleared within the 8 hour response SLT.

Of the remaining 43 incidents, 42 were cleared within the 5 day SLT and 1 late due to attendance at the BLE
Workshop on 22"° January 2008. The increase appears to be due to more customer/client enquiries being
raised.

Reconciliation issues in January.

There were no reconciliation issues in January.

7 Sense & Respond

The data captured during January has highlighted the top 2 highest demand types as being Hardware and
Software. Trend analysis has shown the total call volume for Hardware during January to have increased by 503
calls (total of 8595) and an increase of Software calls by 163 calls (total of 2163).

There was a total of 1217 Pin Pad calls in January, with the highest call type being ‘Smart Card reader faults’
(372 calls). ‘Ask card to be swiped’ is now the second highest Pin Pad failure. Hypercom will be sent an
example unit along with the counter login to investigate why this issue occurs.

It is thought that the Pin Pad card cleaners could resolve many of these issues. A business case is in progress.

For hardware demand, the highest call volume received is for Counter Printer faults (2919 calls received in
January — a decrease of 185 calls from December). There is a Sense and Respond action in place to increase
the volume of calls resolved by HSD, and we are capturing information and investigating the calls with engineer
resolution code R08- ‘No action taken/User advised’.

During January, 4737 chase calls were received (+1590 calls from December), with the highest chase call type
being for Customer Calls (1411 calls). 986 engineering update chase calls were received during January. An
additional objective regarding engineering calls is to reduce the amount of calls to the HSD from Touch, Fujitsu
and ROMEC engineers.

An action measuring the amount of calls received from engineers shows an increase from December to January
of 985 calls (a total of 2574 inbound calls received from engineers). The majority of these calls were
appropriate, requesting various HSD checks, and the number of inappropriate calls, for example asking
how/what to do, has decreased. This action is now closed pending review due to the decreased level of
inappropriate calls.

1081 calls were logged during January as the result of a monitor fault- a decrease of 255 calls from December.
This represented a total of 789 faults (73%) being resolved by engineering and 292 faults (27%) by the HSD.
The Sense and Respond monitor action aims to improve the HSD fix rate, and a ‘Sharing knowledge’ meeting is
currently being arranged between HSD, Engineering and Optima in order to review current monitor diagnostics
from the desk and to identify further checks/tools/approaches that can be adopted to help increase first time fix
at the desk.

1264 Inappropriate calls were received by HSD from Post Masters during January. This is an increase of 340
calls from December, and makes up 10% of all calls. The rise in Inappropriate calls is thought to be the result of
NBSC changing its call/support options, as Post Masters now call HSD instead of calling NBSC direct, believing
they can be put straight through rather than having to use call direct options or leaving voicemail. The rise is
also thought to be the result of multiple Inappropriate calls from individual branches. Branches making more
than 3 Inappropriate calls per month are being tracked, and a list is sent to POL for investigation and education.
