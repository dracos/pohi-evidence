Input into CAPS Programme Board Report
for Meeting on 15 January 1999

Introduction
This report summarises the state of the overall HORIZON:
Programme as at 31 December 1998, with updates to key areas.

Programme Overview
The major focus of the Programme at the current time is:

*. supporting the existing live systems

+ reviewing with Pathway the status of testing and the robustness
of the system

«progressing the ‘Programme Management’ content of the Plan :
with respect to the Live Trial, Multiple Benefits and the NR2+
Release, and brokering a way forward

+ clarifying contractual issues and the acceptance process.

+ Service Management development

+ ‘supporting the Treasury review and resulting negotiations.

Live Operations

The current Release continues to provide'a Benefit Payment Service
and Order Book Control System for Child Benefit Payments in 204
outlets (119 in the South West & South Wales Region and 85 in the
North East Region). From an operational point of view, there are no
major threats to business continuity.

Six incomplete transactions (ITs) were generated during November;
a promising reduction from last month’s reported figure of 13 (this
equates, to 0.7 per 10,000 against a target of 0). ITs are still a source
of concern and remain the number one priority with both POCL
and ICL Pathway operational environments.

During November there were approximately 86,000 encashments
with a total value in excess of £2.7m (includes foreign encashments).

The Business Service Management Team continues to produce a
monthly Service Report which includes service performance reports
and operational issues / threats. The latest report was issued on 30
December 1998. CAPS are included on the distribution list.

Progress against the Master Plan and Integrated Programme Plan
The Programme Master Plan (MP version 4) and Integrated Plan
(IPP version 1) will be formally updated following current proposed
revisions to the ‘Critical Path Plan’ that was agreed in the Treasury
Review. The HORIZON level 0 and level 1 plans are currently being
updated to reflect recent work, including discussions with
members of the CAPS Management Team on 5 January. Pathway
are also in the process of updating their plan to version 7.

5.2

The current planning work has proposed changes to a number of
key milestones in the area of the POCL Child Benefit
implementation. A report of these changes, and current progress,
will be given at the CAPS Board together with the implications for
the Multi-Benefit stream and NR2+.

ICL Pathway Release 2
Release Management

- A joint meeting was held between Horizon, CAPS and Pathway on

the 18 December which agreed potential options and issues to be
addressed in both single and multi-benefit testing. Following this

meeting, a Horizon/Pathway meeting reviewed the status of testing:

and the robustness of the system on 23 December. Pathway agreed
the proposed Horizon planned dates for undertaking pre-proving
activities and MOT, starting migration and starting NRO.

Further discussions with CAPS and Pathway took place on

_ 4/5 January covering the plan, the review procedures, modus

operandi and resourcing..These covered for example: the need to
run the tests in a more controlled manner and to manage the length
of the E2E working day. The current key milestone dates are
proposed as follows for POCL Child benefit:

6Jan Start pre-proving

8 Feb Start E2E

15 Feb Start MOT

Week of 5 Apr Release Authorisation Board

8/9 May Data.Centre migration

15/16 May Contingency weekend for Data Centre
migration

Testing :
The pre-Christmas targeted testing completed on 16 December. Thi
results indicated improvements in software quality, for example
balancing cash accounts, but was run on a limited set of data.
Witnessing of reported cleared pinICLs indicated a failure rate of
around 20%. Based on this progress Horizon concluded that we
were prepared to move into the fuller pre-proving exercise, and that
the timescale for the pre-proving could be slightly reduced but
subject to specific success conditions being satisfied.

A Checkpoint Meeting was held on 23 December to agree the way
forward, and Pathway accepted the Horizon approach to the pre-
proving exercise prior to MOT and E2E Final. Financial integrity of

the system will be specifically monitored by a set of co-ordinators in
addition to previous arrangements.

Pre-proving is planned to commence on 6 January, to run in two
phases. The first will concentrate on Counter Activity, running a 6
day plan without connecting back-end processes. Once progress
has proved satisfactory, we will then repeat the 6 day plan, this time
connecting the back-end systems (notably TIP and HAPS). :

This should enable us to reach a-level of confidence on the counter
before proceeding to the back-end. batch processes, and finally
proceeding to MOT / E2E Final. Agreed criteria for proceeding
between each stage will be drawn up with Pathway during w/c 4
January. .If testing proceeds without major difficulty, the first
internal checkpoint will occur on 14 January to review Counter
processing. Joint checkpoints with CAPS are scheduled for 18
January and 3 February to agree moving forward into MOT and
E2E Final.

Daily update meetings will be held with Pathway so that a common
understanding of issues emerges, and prompt action can be taken as
required.

Live Reference Data Proving and Y2k is proceeding satisfactorily.

Good progress continues on all 4 Technical and Security test
streams with Systems Management, Security, Integrity Test Reports
and Performance Tranche 1 Closure Report all approved.

Acceptance

Work continues on the review of acceptance specs with all
comments from Horizon and sponsors sent to Pathway on 4
December. Three Acceptance Specifications (BES, PAS/CMS and I
Reference Data) remain at “Red” status and it will be February
before they are all finally resolved. These outstanding specs are
being negotiated between all parties to agree appropriate evidence
for acceptance. Unresolved issues, where possible, are being
caveated for escalation and future resolution. ‘Lack of agreement,
however, i is not precluding progress with the acceptance tests.

Following a workshop on the subject of witnessing Pathway
acceptance tests, an agreement on the approach has been reached
with all parties. HORIZON has issued, for review, the procedure
on the handling of acceptance incidents when they arise. Work has
commenced to identify all acceptance reviews to ensure that we
have adequate planning and resource availability

Implementation
Migration ;
Release Management will manage the ‘migration pre-proving —
exercise using live reference data in order for POCL to gain
confidence with all migration scenarios.
A data centre migration date of 8/9 May is proposed with 15/16
May as a contingency. This will avoid conflict with the CAPS 3.5 go
live on 29/30 May. Release Management confirmed this approach
with CAPS on 5 January.
Live Trial
Release Management have met with POCL and BA to develop the
approach to live trial.. With the agreement, in-principle, of the NR2
release dates, this work will continue to be taken forward.
National Rollout
Agreement has been reached with ICL Pathway on the end date for
incomplete -preparations and modification snagging, to be
completed be end of January 1999. _
A revised approach to the deployment of Survey Support
Managers has also been reached ‘to ensure quality checking is
triggered at earliest point of rollout process.

Work continues to develop the new Support centre and recruit staff.
The business case is in final draft prior to circulation for comment. It

Future Releases

Release 2 + (introducing AP Smart and Logistics Feeder System
functionality)

HORIZON continues to progress toward development of the end- ~

to-end design for the following components of NR2+: LFS, AP

smart, AP direct client interfaces; Soft EVP and Operational TIP.

A meeting has been held with Pathway & POCL to discuss
Reference Data hangouts from NR2 to be included in NR2+.

Planning for NR2+ is being progressed with several CCNs being
approved and initial milestones identified.

Release 3

HORIZON has intercepted Release 3 design and is discussing
EFTPOS with all parties.

This report has been produced in accordance with the guidelines
agreed between Peter Crahan and the Horizon Programme Director
on 15 April 1998. The area not covered is ‘Routine Commercial /
Contractual Activity’ where no request had been made by the CAPS
PMO for specific detail, and no input received from the Horizon
Joint Contracts Team.
