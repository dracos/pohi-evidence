I attach a draft for discussion of our preliminary views on issues and options regarding the future of the Scheme. We
thought it made sense to draft the paper with reference to the remaining four questions that were posed but, as you
requested, not answered in our first Report.

We had done a substantial amount of work on this aspect of the original brief before you asked us to limit the scope of the
first Report and before we have ventilated fully all of our thoughts with you, but we thought it useful to include all of that

thinking and

drafting (together with the remaining issues we did not get to) as a starting point. This means the paper may

be longer and more detailed than you had envisaged or may be too “directive”, rather than “suggestive”, for present
purposes. We are happy to cut it back or summarise wherever you think necessary.

Do let us know if you have any questions or comments, otherwise we look forward to seeing you here tomorrow at 5.30pm
to discuss this.

Kind regards

Jonathan

Hi Jonathan

Would you please be able to let me know when we can expect to receive a note of the options. We have a meeting with

the CEO on Wednesday at 4pm and need to put together a plan in advance of that based on the options.
Best wishes

Thanks. I attach the note setting out our thoughts on what a report into Horizon would entail.

We will aim to get you an outline of our thinking to date on the options work as early as possible on Monday.
Kind regards

Jonathan,
Post our conference call I think the plan remains as we discussed on the phone.
@ On the assurance work you are sending your note through today.
¢ On the options work we will look to get a couple of hours in the diary to discuss options — probably on
Tuesday. To support that work it would be good if you can set out where your thinking has got to on the
potential options and their viability. It would be good to have that paper as early as possible in Monday.
e — Iwill ask Chris’ office to set up the meeting.

Thanks

David
