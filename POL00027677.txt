Subject: RE: Weekly update

Paula — here is your update for last week.

Mediation Process Launch
e 53 Applications in total, breakdown below
o 6 new applications this week

44 - Acceptance letters and funding agreements sent to SPMR’s.
1 - awaiting internal checks
3 - waiting for additional information to be supplied by SPMR
4- PO will continue to investigate SPMR’s cases internally as they have not exhausted internal processes.
1 - declined because they are still the legal process (being reviewed by the WG)

Policy for compensation: Positive sub group meeting held last week to provide steer for Andy P (Bond Dickenson).
Another session booked for the group to review/agree, we will then apply some initial applications to this to test the
policy. We will bring this back to Steering Board w/c 28th.

Independent Chair
e — Following your call with Sir Anthony on Friday we will progress the comms and get and initial meeting for Sir Anthony and
the Working Group next week. In preparation for this we are reviewing the TOR for the Group again, identifying topics we
want to make sure he understands and areas want to resolve and get his buy in to (e.g. role or Second Sight).
Improvement Work stream
* Following the Improvement programme board last week the members have been writing behaviours and outcomes that
they as leaders should be looking for from their teams, these get reviewed on a call on Tuesday. Iam sure you will
remember the “as is” experiences we went through in Swansea, next week we agree who will lead in creating the “to-be”
experiences as well as the teams that will input/shape these.

Legal and Adjudication of future case
e No update - but case reviews still continue with Cartwright King and expected to complete at the end of October.

e Rod provided an update at the Steering Board from Brian Altman on his work to date. We will be preparing a paper for
Steering, ExCo and the Board about PO’s future role in relation to prosecutions.

Regards

Andy
