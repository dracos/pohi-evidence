POST OFFICE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE

Horizon - Settlement Policy for the Initial Complaint Review and Mediation Scheme
(the “Scheme”)

1. Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to:

1.1. request approval for a Settlement Policy which sets the framework for making
decisions about financial settlements of claims under the Scheme;

1.2. set out the strategy for managing the potential gap between Subpostmasters’
expectations about the value of settlements and the amount that Post Office
may be prepared to offer (the “Expectations Gap”); and

1.3. seek the Executive Committee’s views on this strategy could be developed
further.

2. Background

2.1. Following the publication of the Second Sight Report in July 2013, Post Office
announced a number of steps which it would take to address the issues raised
in the Report.

2.2. One step was to create the Scheme to help resolve the concerns of
Subpostmasters regarding the Horizon system and other associated issues.
Although the Scheme is primarily aimed at applicants who are no longer
Subpostmasters, it is also open to existing Subpostmasters provided they
have previously raised their complaint with us, and exhausted our internal
investigation processes.

2.3. At the time of writing, we have received 94 applications. This already exceeds
our original planning assumptions of 75 cases in total. The Scheme closes on
18 November 2013.

3. The Scheme

3.1. I The Scheme was designed, and is overseen by, a Working Group comprising
members of Post Office, JFSA and Second Sight. Sir Anthony Hooper was
appointed as the Independent Chair of the Working Group on 18 October
2013.

3.2. The objectives of the Scheme are to:

. provide a mechanism to investigate a Subpostmaster’s concerns
proportionately and effectively;

. try to achieve a mutual and final resolution of a Subpostmaster’s
legitimate concerns about Horizon and any associate issues, whether
through mediation or direct discussions.

3.3. The role of the Working Group is to:

. monitor the fairness and efficiency of the Scheme in achieving its
objectives;

. ensure the cases progress through the Scheme in a timely manner;
and

. review Subpostmasters’ cases which may not be suitable for the

Scheme and decide whether and how those cases may proceed.

4. Ensuring the success of the Scheme

4.1. Post Office has invested time and money in creating the Scheme, and
positioned it with the media, MPs and JFSA as the response to the Second
Sight Report. It is therefore important that the Scheme achieves its objectives
and is generally acknowledged as being successful in answering the concerns
of Subpostmasters.

4.2. From the Post Office’s perspective the Scheme will have been a success if,
when it has completed:

. the media, MPs and JFSA consider that the Scheme fairly investigated
and, where appropriate, addressed the Subpostmaster concerns
identified in the Second Sight report, even if there is disagreement
over the outcome of individual cases;

. Post Office can more robustly defend its use of the Horizon system
against criticism by a minority of Subpostmasters who, despite best
efforts, remain entrenched in their dissatisfaction with Post Office;

. the cost to Post Office in terms of financial settlements is not
excessive, but proportionate and consistent with the proper use of
public money; and

° the general body of Subpostmasters retain their confidence in the
Horizon system.

4.3. Given there is currently no evidence of any systemic problem with the Horizon
system, Post Office’s view when designing the Scheme was that excessive
compensation payments would be unlikely and, for example, an apology may
be a more appropriate remedy. The Scheme documentation itself says that
‘compensation is one possible solution that could be agreed by the parties but
this will depend on what happened in [the individual] case’.

4.4. However, it is becoming apparent from some of the early cases coming into
the Scheme, and comments made by JFSA (in the media and to
Subpostmasters), that in some instances a “gap” is emerging between what

POL00027506

Confidential —- Subject to Legal Privilege

applicants and JFSA may be expecting, and what Post Office might consider
to be an appropriate financial settlement, i.e. the Expectations Gap.

4.5. For the Scheme to provide a successful closure to the Horizon episode, we
need to manage both the costs and the Expectations Gap.

5. Managing costs

5.1. Each case will turn on its own facts. Whether compensation is appropriate
(and if so, how much) must therefore be assessed on a case-by-case basis,
and signed off by Post Office Finance.

5.2. It is not possible to accurately assess the overall costs to Post Office until all
cases have been investigated and we have a clearer idea of the approach the
Working Group will take on the suitability of cases for mediation. We will keep
the situation under review given that some mediations are likely to take place
before others have been fully investigated.

5.3. Nevertheless, we have always envisaged that some cases will result in a
financial settlement. It is therefore important that any payments are justifiable,
consistent and proportionate, and that we have an agreed policy in place to
facilitate this before we begin considering financial settlements for individual
cases.

5.4. The draft Settlement Policy attached at Annex 1 sets out a framework,
principles and process for considering cases where it is clear that the
applicant is seeking a financial settlement. Applying this policy will allow us

to:

° manage and control costs;

. approach financial settlements consistently; and

. provide the Post Office mediation team with a clear mandate for

settlement prior to entering mediation discussions (this is a pre-
requisite to mediation).

6. Managing the Expectations Gap

6.1. The fact that cases have been progressed through the Scheme should lend
credibility to their outcomes. Specifically:

. the Scheme was developed collaboratively with JFSA and Second
Sight, who are also on the Working Group overseeing the progress of
cases through the Scheme;

e the Working Group has an independent Chair with considerable
experience in overseeing complex cases;

° applicants are allowed up to £2,750 (plus VAT) towards the fees of a
professional advisor to help prepare their case and attend mediation;

13 November 2013

Confidential —- Subject to Legal Privilege

. by its very nature, mediation is designed to support parties in finding
common ground and therefore is, in itself, a mechanism for managing
expectations within the confidentiality of a mediation discussion.

6.2. Still, certain Subpostmasters are claiming millions of pounds, when Post
Office’s view of potential compensation is much more modest. However,
having established a Scheme with no express financial limits, and accepted
applications on that basis, we could be criticised for changing the goal-posts if
we start publicly suggesting limits at this stage.

6.3. Although confidentiality will be a feature of any settlement agreement, we
should expect some detail to find its way into the public domain. Although
Post Office could, rightly, be criticised if settlement figures were seen to be
high, public and political opinion is generally on the side of Subpostmasters.

6.4. To minimise the risk of Subpostmasters being dissatisfied having come
through the Scheme, we need to begin to manage expectations. As well as
wishing to avoid adverse publicity, we have a responsibility to help ensure that
Subpostmasters are not disappointed when they already feel they have been
let down by Post Office.

6.5. In considering how to manage the Expectations Gap it is important to maintain
the integrity of the Scheme. In particular we have to consider:

. legal privilege — the Settlement Policy is, and must remain, confidential
and privileged. Disclosing all or part of the Policy is likely to cause
privilege to be lost. There are therefore strict limits of what information
can be disclosed, and to whom;

. public impact on applicants, stakeholders and the media — a
perception that Post Office is trying to limit an applicant's freedom to
raise whatever complaints they see fit could lead to criticism;

. impact on the Working Group — managing the Expectations Gap may
create tensions within the Working Group which affect its collaborative
focus;

° evidence based decisions — making public statements about Post

Office's expected outcomes for the Scheme may appear to be pre-
supposing or undermining the process.

6.6. The Chair, with his judicial background, should understand the need for
settlements to be reasonable and based on properly evidenced facts. It is
also in his interest to have presided over a successful Scheme. We propose

to:
. open discussions with the Chair to take his views on how we might
approach the task of managing the Expectations Gap; and
. use opportunities presented in meetings with MPs and others, should
the subject arise, to restate our original position in relation to
resolutions not necessarily being financial.

7. Examples

7.1. As set out in para’s 5.1 and 5.2 above, we do not have sufficient information
at this stage to assess the potential overall cost of financial settlements to
Post Office.

7.2. However we have worked through two live examples to illustrate how the
Settlement Policy might work in practice and how the Post Office approach to
settlement might compare with the expectations of individual Subpostmasters
(see Annex 2).

7.3. We cannot tell at this stage how typical these examples are, but have
provided them to help bring the Policy and proposals in this paper to life.
8. Communications

8.1. At present our media position is reactive, and we are avoiding giving regular
public updates on the Scheme and the number of applications.

8.2. We are developing a communications strategy to coincide with the first
mediation decisions. We will agree our approach with the Chair of the
Working Group, and possibly the Group itself. There is every indication that
the Chair does not favour media attention and already has plans to try to
restrict individual parties to the Working Group making comments about the
scheme to the media.
9. Conclusion
9.1. The Settlement Policy and an approach to managing expectations, agreed
with the Chair of the Working Group, will promote the success of the Scheme.
10. I Recommendations
The Executive Committee is asked to:

10.1. approve the Settlement Policy

10.2. note the arrangements for managing the Expectations Gap.

3. General approach to settlements under the Scheme

This section sets out the methodology for monitoring and scoping the overall costs
and outcomes of settlements under the Scheme.

Settlement Principles

3.1. Aset of Settlement Principles will be drawn up that will guide the approach
to settling each Complaint.

3.2 The Settlement Principles will be set out in this Policy —- see section 5
3.3. The Settlement Principles will be reviewed regularly.
3.4 The Principles will be revised as necessary to address any changes in:
3.4.1. the Scheme
3.4.2 the number/nature of the Complaints
3.4.3 past mediations or settlements

3.4.4 The Outcome Assessment (see below)

Fix the number of complaints

3.5 Applications by Applicants to the Scheme must be received by 18
November 2013.

3.6 Following the application deadline, the total number of applications will be
known but the value of any complaints may still be unclear.

3.7 An initial review and assessment of the complaints will be undertaken at
this stage applying the Settlement Principles to test the efficacy of the
Principles in practice.
POL00027506

POL00027506

Confidential and legally privileged

Value the complaints

3.8

3.9

3.10

On receipt of an Applicant's applications and case questionnaire, Second
Sight will work with Post Office to investigate the Complaint.

This investigation should produce greater clarity as to the types of
settlement and compensation being sought by Applicants.

This information will be regularly reviewed to assess the possible outcome
and costs of settlements under the Scheme (the Outcome Assessment).

Set Settlement Parameters

3.11

3.12

Following the investigation phase, it should be possible to separately
assess the merits of each Complaint and produce a Recommendation for
Settlement (see section 4 below)

The Recommendations for Settlement will be reviewed holistically on a
regular basis and used to further update the Outcome Assessment.

Mediation

3.13

3.14

3.15

At mediation, a settlement will be sought within the parameters of the
Recommendation for Settlement.

The result of any Mediation (whether or not there is a settlement) will be
communicated to all internal key stakeholders.

The results of any mediations will be reviewed holistically on a regular basis
and used to further update the Outcome Assessment.

Reporting

3.16

3.17

The updated Outcome Assessment will be presented to the Steering Group
on a regular basis for their consideration.

The following management information about the Scheme will be tracked:

. Applications received

4. Process for considering individual complaints

This section sets out the process for handling and trying to resolve each individual
Complaint.

Background

4.1 Following the investigation into a specific Complaint, the Working Group will
take a decision on whether the case is suitable for mediation.

4.2. Mediation is a consensual process so even if the Working Group decides
that a case is suitable for mediation, Post Office is not required to mediate
(though there may be negative consequences in refusing to do so).

4.3 It may be that some cases can be resolved before mediation through direct
engagement with the Applicant.

4.4 If asettlement is agreed through mediation, the mediator is likely to insist
that the parties sign a settlement agreement on the day of the mediation.

4.5 Those persons attending mediation (or engaging directly with an Applicant)
on behalf of Post Office therefore need a clear mandate as to the nature
and scope of any settlement that might be offered.

Suitability for mediation

4.6 Following the investigation into a specific Complaint but before the Working
Group decides whether a case is suitable for mediation, POL Legal will, in
consultation with other internal stakeholders, advise on whether POL
should:

46.1 Vote against mediation at the Working Group and refuse to mediate
even if the Working Group votes in favour of mediation.

46.2 Vote against mediation at the Working Group but allow mediation to
proceed if the Working Group votes in favour of mediation.

46.3 Vote in favour of mediation at the Working Group.
POL00027506

47

This advice will be passed to Post Office's representatives on the Working
Group.

Recommendation for Settlement

48

4.10

4.11

4.12

If POL wishes to attempt to settle a Complaint (by mediation or direct
engagement), the Complaint and the investigation findings will be internally
reviewed in order to produce a Recommendation for Settlement.

Where the Applicant has been subject to a criminal conviction, the
investigation findings will be sent to POL's prosecution team to ensure that
Post Office is complying with its prosecution duties (in particular, its on-
going disclosure duties).

POL Legal (or external counsel) will be responsible for leading the process
of producing the Recommendation for Settlement in order to ensure that
legal privilege is preserved. The Recommendation for Settlement will
recommend:

4.10.1 Whether Post Office should attempt to resolve the Complaint
before mediation?

4.10.2 Possible settlement options
4.10.3. If applicable, the financial limits for a compensation payment.

Internal stakeholders will be consulted as appropriate on the
Recommendation for Settlement.

The Recommendation for Settlement will be revised and finalised by POL
Legal (or external counsel) and the communications team.

Approval to settle

4.13

The Recommendation for Settlement will be considered by Charles
Colquhoun (or a suitable alternative person nominated by Charles) who
will:

4.13.1 Ensure the Recommendation for Settlement complies with the
Settlement Principles and this Settlement Policy.
POL00027506
POL00027506

Confidential and legally privileged

4.13.2 Ensure that the Recommendation for Settlement is consistent with
the approach adopted in other Complaints.

4.13.3 Approve or propose changes to the Recommendation for
Settlement.

4.14 A mandate will be issued to those attending mediation or engaging directly
with Applicants confirming that they may settle the Complaint within the
scope of the approved Recommendation for Settlement.

Mediation

4.15 The attendees for mediation will be identified which shall include at least 1
lawyer and 1 representative of Post Office. The representative of Post
Office shall be:

4.15.1 Of appropriate seniority commensurate with the nature of the
Complaint and the level of settlement envisaged in the
Recommendation for Settlement.

4.15.2 From a part of the business that relates to the nature of the
complaint raised.

4.16 POL Legal (or external counsel) will liaise with CEDR (the mediation
provider) regarding the logistics of the mediation.

5. Settlement Principles

This section sets out the Settlement Principles that will guide the scope of any
settlement offered to an Applicant.

A.

Overarching Principles

The following principles overarch the general approach to settlement:

5.1

5.2

5.3

5.4

5.5

Any settlement must take account of the risk that the settlement may set a
precedent that could (a) open the floodgates to more claims (both inside
and outside the Scheme) and/or (b) increase expectations for existing
claims.

Applicants will generally need to show that the matters that they are raising
actually led them to suffer a financial loss in their branch before a
settlement is offered.

Generally, settlements (including compensation) will only be offered for
alleged harm that arises directly out of, or was an obviously foreseeable
consequence of, a breakdown in the business relationship between the
Applicant and the Post Office.

The extent of any settlement (including the value of any compensation) will
be based on Post Office's "Risk Assessment" of the Complaint which shall
take account of:

5.4.1. The weight of the evidence adduced to demonstrate that the
Complaint and any harm suffered by an Applicant is true;

5.4.2 Post Office's culpability for the Complaint;

5.4.3. The extent to which the matters complained of caused the alleged
harm suffered by an Applicant; and

5.4.4 The extent to which the Applicant's own acts or omissions
contributed to the Complaint or harm suffered as a result.

Settlements involving convicted Applicants should only be offered where
there is clear evidence of a miscarriage of justice (see section 5.2 below).
POL00027506
POL00027506

Confidential and legally privileged

5.8

5.9

5.10

Settlements will generally be driven by commercial fairness rather than
legal principles, but legal risk will still be a factor.

Settlements should to take account of the reputational implications for the
Post Office arising from any adverse publicity or political reactions but that
should not be an overriding factor. The greater the value of the settlement,
the more public interest is likely to be attracted.

Settlements that involve commercial solutions, apologies and other non-
financial compromises are to be favoured over compensation.

Although settlements are likely to be subject to confidentiality agreements,
any settlement should take into account the risk that details of that
settlement may leak into the subpostmaster community and/or the media.

Settlements should reflect the fact that for the purposes of the Scheme,
Post Office will not be relying on any legal limitation or time-bar defence
and will consider all Complaints regardless of age.

Criminal cases

Background

5.11

5.12

Offering a settlement to an Applicant who has been convicted could:
5.11.1 Be used as the basis for an appeal against that conviction; and/or
5.11.2 Cause that conviction to become unsafe.

As such, settlements involving convicted Applicants should only be offered

where there is clear evidence of a miscarriage of justice and the process
below has been followed.

Process

5.13

5.14

Where a Complaint relates to an Applicant who has been convicted, the
following additional processes should be followed:

5.13.1. The Applicant's application, case questionnaire and any
investigation findings should be forwarded to Post Office's criminal
lawyers (Cartwright King — "CK")

5.13.2 CK will review the above documents to determine whether any
disclosure is required under Post Office's prosecution duties.

5.13.3 CK will be consulted on any Recommendation for Settlement and
advise how the proposed settlement may affect the Applicant's
conviction.

Post Office has no power to overturn a conviction. If, following the
investigation phase, grounds for appeal are identified, the standard
approach will be to:

5.14.1 Suspend the standard mediation process.

5.14.2 Disclose the information giving rise to the grounds for appeal to the
Applicant (via CK).

5.14.3 Consider whether Post Office will support or oppose any appeal.
POL00027506
POL00027506

Confidential and legally privileged

5.14.4 Consider whether Post Office might offer financial support to the
Applicant in order to conduct the appeal.

5.14.5 Consider whether it is more appropriate to conduct the mediation
before or after any appeal is heard. In most cases, it will be more
appropriate for the appeal to be heard first.

5.14.6 Write to the Applicant explaining Post Office's stance on the above
matters and seek their views on how they wish to proceed.

5.14.7. Where a conviction is overturned on appeal, mediation may
subsequently be used to resolve the Applicant's claims / losses that
flow from that wrongful conviction.
5.15

5.16

Settlement thresholds

POL00027506
POL00027506

Confidential and legally privileged

Complaints will have various degrees of credibility and will be supported by evidence of varying quality. To ensure
consistency, this section sets out guideline thresholds for when a Complaint may be considered to have sufficient
credibility/supporting evidence to merit a settlement.

The list of Complaints set out below is not exhaustive — where a Complaint is not on the list below, a case-by-case decision will

be required.

5.17 The Settlement Thresholds are for guidance only — settlements may be offered in other circumstances if good reasons exist.

Second Sight's Interim Report found that there were no systemic errors in Horizon.

As such, very clear proof will be required of a technical defect in Horizon along with evidence
that that technical defect (i) caused a quantifiable financial loss in the Applicant's branch
accounts and (ii) had a material adverse effect on an Applicant.

Any case that is considering a settlement on this ground should be referred immediately to
the CIO for comment.

about the usability of the system or that its processes are unclear / too complex.

As such, a general complaint that Horizon (or its related processes) is too difficult to operate
will therefore not be sufficient to warrant a settlement.

The Applicant needs to identify a specific problem transaction that did not have a clear or
established operating practice.

The facts of the case should be considered carefully as there may be circumstances where
Post Office has offered training but the SPMR has refused to attend or take up Post Office
on the offer of further training.

However, in circumstances where Post Office has allowed the issue to grow, by for example,
not addressing the issue in a timely manner, a settlement may be considered (but only if
there is a clear evidence of a failure/delay on Post Office's part).

5.21

Lack of support for SPMR.

Helplines were unhelpful.

The Applicant needs show that they sought support from Post Office and that the support
provided did not solve the issue.

The facts of the case should be considered carefully as there may be circumstances where
Post Office has offered training but the SPMR has refused to attend or take Post Office up
on the offer of further training.

If, given the particular circumstances, there is evidence that Post Office has not properly
supported a SPMR in that Post Office:

(a) _ failed to follow its established practices in effect at the time of the events
complained about; or

(b) there was a manifest error in those practices that should have been remedied at

F. Goodwill payments

5.35 Goodwill payments may be considered where an Applicant suffers harm
that cannot be quantified in pecuniary terms (eg. injury to feelings, distress,
social discredit, reputation damage, etc.). A goodwill payment may, in Post
Office's discretion, be offered if:

5.35.1 A settlement threshold has been met under section C; and

5.35.2 The Applicant has not deliberately caused the non-pecuniary harm
(eg. where the applicant has invited adverse media attention); and

5.35.3 The harm suffered is sufficiently serious to warrant a goodwill
payment in accordance with the thresholds below:

Type of harm Threshold

Distress / injured feelings The distress must be more than normal
commercial pressure that would be
experienced through loss of contract /

business.
Damage to reputation / social The damage to reputation requires
discredit evidence that the relevant events were

publicly known and led to public
criticism (eg. adverse press coverage).

5.36 If the above thresholds are met, the level of goodwill payment will be
dependent on the level of harm and Post Office's culpability for that harm in
accordance with the guidelines below. It is anticipated that where a
goodwill payment is appropriate, most cases will fall in the bottom band.

Band Goodwill payment

Bottom band for less serious cases, such as a one-off £600 - £6,000
incident or an isolated event, which has contributed to the
Applicant's distress or reputation damage. This band will
be appropriate where the Applicant has also contributed
to their own problems through negligence or
carelessness.

POST OFFICE LTD EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
WAVE PROGRAMME UPDATE

1. Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to:

1.1. Update the Executive Committee (ExCo) on the status of the Mobile (Wave)
Programme.

1.2. Gain ExCo endorsement for the revised approach to Post office Limited (POL)
mobile market entry following the recent disengagement from Fujitsu.

2. Key Points

2.1. I POL has now disengaged from the process of developing a managed service
approach to mobile market entry through Fujitsu (Plan A).

2.2. POL has disengaged from Plan A as it has now become apparent that Fujitsu
could not meet the required deadlines, progress was slow and confidence was
lost that a viable offer could be established.

2.3. POL has investigated alternative routes to enter the mobile market and
recommends entering the market by integrating with several mobile providers
to provide a white-labelled mobile proposition (Plan B).

2.4. Plan B gives POL a greater likelihood of launching a mobile offering in July
2014 (the launch date for Plan A). In addition, Plan B increases POL’s profit to
forecast in this area by £11m for the period between launch and end of
financial year 2019/20. However, it is recognised that there is still a shortfall
when compared to the Strategic Plan targets due to missing the original
launch date of November 2013.

2.5. Plan B brings POL’s proposed operating model in-line with the mobile industry
and uses tried and tested partnerships.

3. Background
This paper is intended to be read along with Annex 1 where a full analysis is provided.

3.1. In 2012 POL conducted a supply market test and concluded that the mobile
wholesale market was well established and that there was a breadth of
suppliers willing to provide a full managed service.

3.2. I POL undertook consumer research which strongly indicated that POL would
be well placed to launch a mobile proposition.

3.3. A fully competitive supplier selection process started in January 2013.
However the number of providers narrowed as the process progressed,
resulting in Fujitsu receiving preferred bidder status in July 2013 (refer to
section 2 in Annex 1).

Strictly Confidential

3.4. I Progress with Fujitsu was slow and confidence was lost that a viable offer
could be established within acceptable timescales. Despite high level
engagement, confidence could not be restored and as a result the
procurement was closed on 28" October 2013 (refer to section 2 in Annex 1).

3.5. As a result of disengaging with Fujitsu, the project team investigated
alternative routes to entering the mobile market. This investigation looked at
1) contracting directly with mobile partners and 2) entering the market as a
branded reseller.

Current Situation

4.1. The investigation of alternative routes to entering the mobile market focussed
on whether following Plan B would be feasible and what impact this would
have for POL.

4.2. Following Plan B means POL would partner with several mobile providers to
offer a white-labelled mobile proposition, with POL taking on the management
of the service. This differs from Plan A, where POL would employ a single
contractor to manage the service with several mobile subcontractors providing
the infrastructure (refer to sections 3 and 4 of Annex 1).

Options Considered
5.1. The options considered also included POL entering the market as a branded

reseller. However given the low level of commercial return associated with this
approach, this is not recommended (refer to appendix 1 in Annex 1).

Commercial Impact/Costs

6.1. Plan B reduces the entry costs from £11.7m to £6.9m for both pre-pay and
post-pay services.

6.2. Plan B also reduces the on-going costs due to 1) the removal of the mark-up
on supplier services added by Fujitsu and 2) the replacement of the Fujitsu
managed service cost with a POL full time equivalent overhead.

6.3. Section 6 of Annex 1 provides further detail.

Key Risks/Mitigation

7.1. The risks related to Plan B are covered in detail in Section 9 of Annex 1.
Confidence in Plan A had sunk to such a low level it was unlikely that the
mobile proposition could be launched in July 2014. Research into Plan B
strongly indicates that a mobile proposition with improved commercial benefits
can be delivered in July 2014.

Communications Impact
8.1. There is no specific communications impact at this time. A full
communications plan will be developed during the next stage of the

programme.

. The purpose of this paper is to provide an update on the Wave Programme and to gain ExCo endorsement on the revised approach to 1]
service launch, referred to as ‘Plan B’, following the disengagement with Fujitsu.
. Following an investigation into the alternative routes to enter the market, a recommendation is being made to continue the programme

and enter the market by contracting directly with partners. This means Post Office integrating and managing the service . The revised
operating model gives the greatest chance of success with the added flexibility, control and ability to manage cost.

. The main implications of this revised approach are:

¥  Agreater likelihood of achieving the July 2014 service launch targeted with Fujitsu.

¥ — Significantly reduced entry costs and managed service overhead than quoted under the Fujitsu managed service model - entry
costs with Fujitsu would have been £11.7m; a direct approach is likely to be c.£6.9m

Y Greater flexibility and access to expertise
¥ — Anenhanced role for Post Office as service integrator

e The market opportunity has been endorsed through an extensive primary research programme and ongoing discussions with the
mobile networks. The optimal Pay as You Go (“PAYG”) customer proposition has been designed and tested through research and a
volume forecast generated.

° The conclusions:
* Entry into the mobile market could be a profitable diversification
. The wholesale market was well established and could offer the managed service operating model
. Market entry could be achieved at relatively low cost and within 6 months from contract signature

* Allocation of an income target in the strategic plan

The formal procurement
. On 9th January, Post Office went to market to source a partner. A fully competitive process was conducted. However for a variety of
reasons the number of providers narrowed as the process progressed, resulting in Fujitsu receiving preferred bidder status in July.
The specific reasons for the narrowing of the providers were:
. A decision by EE to offer their services under a Fujitsu managed service rather than direct
. O2 deciding not to bid due to concerns about the level of overlap between the market POL would be targeting and the market
Tesco (a JV with 02) operates in.
. A removal of support from Vodafone for two of their aggregator partners, resulting in them not bidding
*  Adecision by POL not to pursue a Vodafone bid (following the shortlisting process) after a failure to resolve significant
commercial challenges

. Despite bringing together a ‘best in class’ supply chain, the Fujitsu proposal had a number of issues that could not be brought to a
satisfactory conclusion. Consequently, the procurement was closed on 28" October 2013. The concerns Post Office had with Fujitsu
were:

* — Alack of expertise, and no fully integrated solution
Limited flexibility
High fixed costs (set-up costs of £7.5.m and managed service costs of £10m over the contract)

The Alternatives Routes to Market — ‘Plan B’

. The focus has been to explore the ‘typical’ Mobile Virtual Network Operator (“MVNO”) approach to market entry in using
direct partnerships with suppliers

. The secondary focus has been to assess the returns available through a branded reseller agreement. This analysis has
shown low returns typically resulting from a one off commission payment and it is therefore not recommended that this
option is explored further at this time. Further information can be found in Appendix 1

The Sourcing Plan and Risks .

Awilling supply base with industry leading proposals

¥ The suppliers that would have sat behind Fujitsu and are willing to contract with Post Office directly for services.

v¥ The competitive tension from the previous process had resulted in industry leading headline prices for airtime
under the Fujitsu led bid (EE versus Vodafone). This makes up the majority of the cost base.

¥ We have received commercial proposals from the key potential partners and all have provided indicative
pricing and contract terms which in some cases are improvements on the terms provided to Fujitsu under the
previous process. In the case of EE, the rates are 10% lower which reflects the Fujitsu margin.

¥ Post Office now has a great opportunity to obtain a cost base from its suppliers to give the service the best
chance of success, without the heavy fixed costs levied under the deal tabled by Fujitsu.

Procurement Approach

¥ — Subject to endorsement on this ‘Plan B’ approach, the team will work with the providers to negotiate suitable
services and associated commercials, with a view to signing contracts in Q4 2013/14

v

For the additional service elements required to deliver post —pay services, Post Office would most likely run
competitive procurements in Q1 2014/15.

Procurement Risk

The previous procurement relied upon the telecoms exception from Public Contract Regulations.

The ‘Plan B’ approach can still rely upon this exception (“Where the principle purpose of the contract is to is to
provide or exploit public telecommunications networks or provide a telecommunications service to the public”.)

The risk is slightly higher under ‘Plan B’, due to Post Office procuring some individual components that could be
deemed non telecoms specific, but the risk is not deemed as material.

~ Whilst some level of integration with the Post Office Broadband and Phone service is possible, integration will be less
straight forward and less far reaching than would have been available under the Fujitsu managed service. However, research
has shown this is less important to customers than originally thought.

~ The solution will have to be designed to be flexible enough to integrate with other Post Office services to ensure that the
value from our unique product offerings can be incorporated into a differentiated mobile product.

Under ‘Plan B’ the Launch Strategy Remains Unchanged ‘

The launch dates detailed below remain aspirational, but all suppliers have confirmed that this is achievable but dependent

on a procurement process being completed by February 2014. Should the initial ‘soft launch’ be delayed beyond late
August, it will be unlikely that a national rollout can happen before January 2015 due to Christmas.

. Launch a simple SIM only & PAYG service as a ‘soft launch’ in July 2014, followed by a national launch in October 2014.
. Launch a ‘30 day rolling’ SIM only contract quickly after a pre-pay launch.
. A full contract service would launch in June 2015, as the services are much more likely to require an ‘assisted sales’

approach and therefore more appropriate to larger branches, where a ‘shop in shop’ approach may be considered.

A mature market close to it’s maximum, but with increasing numbers
of customers looking to switch to an MVNO; 14% in 2009 up to 32% in 2012 -

MARKET INSIGHT COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE

= Market is split 56% post-pay & 44% pre-pay
= Pre-pay connections continue to decline as post-pay SIM

only and post-pay handset contracts attract customers
looking to seek better value

= 30% of pre-pay adds are now SIM only as customers save
money by keeping hold of existing handsets for longer

= Within the pre-pay category disengaged customers result in
switching inertia

= MVNO share is growing with entrants such as Tesco, Lyca
Mobile and Asda. They are finding success with targeted
and unique propositions, and extensive distribution

= Cheaper tariffs and fashionable phones are key hooks to
disengaged consumers

co)

ASDA mobile was launched in April 2007 and currently
represents 1% of the market (460,000 customers)

ASDA have relied mainly on in-store presence, stocking
SIMs at till points. The proposition is based on a simple
low cost tariff

Tesco mobile was launched late 2003 as part of a joint
venture with O2. It currently represents 6% of the market
(=2.7 m customers) spending £12m on communication in
2012. The complexity of the Tesco mobile tariff and.
handset range has expanded over time

Over the last two decades, the network provider competitive landscape has evolved dramatically, with ever more new

entrants, competing on price and aggressive offers

Market Context - what are the reasons to believe POL “ti
can successfully acquire and retain customers
ty,
* Within the pre-pay category disengaged customers cause strong switching inertia, however our research suggests “ty

that 1.4M (3%) of customers are looking to switch to a pre-pay service in the next 12 months.

* Post Office has a great opportunity to disrupt the passive loyalty in the pre-pay market through its ability to have face
to face conversations on the back of relevant cross sell opportunities e.g. Top up, bill payments, POca transactions.
When combined with good levels of consideration for a Post Office mobile service, conversion rates should be good.

¢ Adifferentiated customer proposition giving great value for money and bringing in tactical offers to fit with other
portfolio services e.g. roaming bundles for Travel customers.

* There is a gap in the market for simple, transparent offers, offering genuine value for money. The Post Office brand
can naturally fit into this space.

* Wide distribution — with PAYG and SIM only services available across the entire network, and a compelling revenue
share deal with sub-postmasters to share in the ongoing success.

1. Explore the existing market to identify and size the opportunity landscape for the entry of Post Office into the mobile market.
Assessing the initial openness of the different target audiences to a Post Office pre-pay mobile service.

2. Secondly, identify the levers and hooks (features and servicing) which maximise the demand for a Post Office mobile offering
across the different potential customer audiences.

3. Volume forecast to understand what Post Office can achieve in the pre-pay market.

Customer Research - The Target Market

~~

Target customers are more engaged in the category, more likely to switch and are frequent branch
visitors

* These potential customers represent the stronger
opportunity.

* More engaged with the category, reviewing and
switching offers more regularly.

* More valuable prospects due to their higher mobile
usage and frequent top-up behaviors.

* Easier audiences to reach as they are most frequent
branch and Post Office website visitors.

* More tactical audience to start the conversation via
cross-selling opportunity. Many already use Post Office
for non-mailing needs such as Travel, Government
services, bill payments and mobile top up.

But we will need to anticipate the risks inherent to these
two groups:

* Enable them to make confident decision about handset
as most would get handset and SIM at the same time.

* Less loyal and more price sensitive groups require
investment to ensure retention.

Summary and recommendations “
~~,
. The research programme and engagement with market intelligence experts at EE strongly supports Post “ty,
Office’s entry in to the mobile market %

° Industry experts advise that the Post Office brand, scale and network reach leaves it as one of the few “un-

launched” MVNOs likely to be successful in the UK. Both the French (750k subs) and Italian (>3m subs) Post
Offices have launched similar services in recent years and have significantly over achieved

. The revised operating model gives Post Office the greatest chance of success with the added flexibility,
control and ability to manage cost and aligns with standard industry practice

. It is recommended therefore that the Executive Committee approves the continuation with the product
development and supplier engagement under the revised ‘Plan B’ approach.

Proposition/Solution Ney,

_

. Mobile solution is provided by the mobile operator, including billing, proposition development and pricing, and customer care
. Post Office would be responsible for selling the services and would earn a commission for doing this — one off for PAYG, and

potentially also a recurring revenue share for PAYM
. Any bad debt from a Post Office generated customer would result in a claw back of commission by the Mobile Operator
. The Mobile Operator would retain ownership of the customer, and they have a reputation of continually changing commercials.
. Launch costs would be lower, but Horizon integration costs would still be incurred
* This model is common in the SME segment, but is increasingly less common in the consumer segment
High level Indicative Commercials — Indicative return of 10.25m
Pre-paid
. Commercials received from Elite Mobile, one of the UK’s leading SIM distributors provided the retailer a one off commission of

£3.00, with Post Office receiving an additional 0.75p.
. Based on 10,000 gross prepaid connections a month, that equates to an income stream (after branch commissions) of £90,000 per

year, or £0.45m over five years
Post-paid
° Typical commercials provide resellers with an approximate 25% revenue share plus a connection bonus of £50-£100, with the

reseller having to fund the (ever more expensive) handset.

Indicative calculations show that a £15/month connection may generate a return of £18 over 24 months, with a £20/month
connection returning £53 over 24 months and a £30/month connection returning £166 over 24 months.

is expected that POL customers would tend to be at the lower end of the post-paid spectrum.

POST OFFICE LTD EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
Business risks evaluation November 19" 2013

1. Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to set out the agenda for the risk session at the November ExCo.
2. Background
The Audit, Risk & Compliance Committee (ARC) approved the Post Office risk management
strategy to consider risks from a top-down perspective. A paper has been drafted for the ARC
setting out the ExCo view of critical risks as derived from the current ExCo risk map and profile
which will be discussed later on the same day as this meeting.
Management of risks is a continuous part of BAU process and it is important that ExCo:

«Refresh the view of critical risks for the Board/ARC attention;

e Define the risk appetite, particularly for critical risks; and

e Develop action plans to move risks to their desired ‘target state’.
The objective of this session is to complete the above tasks for those risks defined as critical
and likely in the paper going to the ARC (top 5 risks).
3. Session structure
To achieve this objective we will look at each of the five risks identified and:

« Consider the causes and consequences of the specific risk;

e Define the risk appetite and target level of risk; and

e Propose actions to achieve the target level of risk.

The session will be facilitated by the Head of Risk Governance.
4. Pre-work
ExCo members are asked to reflect on the current risk map and the ARC paper and formulate

their views around the above aims.

This report has been restructured to prioritise the key information in the first 9 pages. The focus of the ExCo meeting
will be on the latest projections and remedial action required rather than an update of recent performance. The more
detailed pages are now in the Appendices for reference but they are not required pre-reading

Profit & Loss - YTD

© Profit at P7 was £65.0m, which was £5.8m favourable to budget of £59.2m, and £7.3m adverse to prior year of
£72.3m. The month is £0.7m favourable, but within this, income was £6.9m adverse, offset by favourable costs which
are largely driven by £3.7m VAT resulting from a change in the recovery rate and £1.8m agents pay benefit relating to
lower sales. The CFO forecast view is still to achieve the full year profit target despite the increasing income gap.

Net income performance of £503.9m remains the key concern with an adverse variance of £24.9m compared to
budget (mainly Mails £16.0m and Lottery £4.3m). The risk on the Sales Recovery plan has increased - a risk of £5-
410m was highlighted through the Q2 FYF review and the P7 results have led to a refinement of the CFO forecast to
reflect the continued adverse performance in Mails and Lottery.

Staff costs have returned to budget in P7 mainly because the Q2 sales bonus was below budget reflecting lower sales.
The budget for the managers’ lump sum pay award is covering the shortfall in efficiency savings but this will unwind if
a pay offer is made, The Cost Reduction Programme is implementing a series of savings activities to drive the cost
down - most will impact on 2014-15 with minor savings coming through in 2013-14.

* Agents’ costs were £20.7m favourable to budget, mainly due to lower sales income £11.9m, sales mix (parcels) £2.3m
and £1.6m due to WHS provision utilisation (relating to the original contract). The favourable agents’ costs are
projected to be largely maintained but with anticipated mails segregation payments (£1.1m) and delays to locals
conversions reducing the full year upside,

Non people costs were £1.4m favourable to budget. The favourable position is driven by £3.7m VAT recovery relating
to H1 for changes in the VAT recovery rate, but masks the underlying adverse variance due to Horizon costs originally
budgeted for in the prior year. RM costs are now treated as non staff following the IPO and we believe there are still
some costs to come through. The VAT recovery has been taken to the CFO forecast (previously in opportunities).
Interbusiness expenditure was £4.7m lower than budget, driven by lower Official Mail costs and property costs. IB
charging ceased from 16th October 2013 following the RM IPO although some catch up costs may still be incurred.
Project costs were £1.5m favourable YTD with the underspend driven by the movement of separation costs to
exceptional items. The current year customer engagement budget continues to cover the spend delayed from 2012-
13 into this year.

Cashflow
The YTD cashflow was an inflow of £197m which was £94m favourable to the £103m inflow budget (Period 6 was
£24m favourable), mostly driven by delays to NTP expenditure.

Crown P&L - YTD
The Crown loss is £0.9m adverse to budget. Income was £2.7m adverse driven primarily by Mails, partially offset by
Government Services. Costs are £1.5m favourable and share of JV is £0.4m favourable,

stamps buy forward last year and lower parcel volumes. Government Services also
decreased as a result of lower rates from the new DVLA contract and falling Card Account
customers. NS&I income fell as mare customers have moved away fram POL.

* Higher staff cost of €2.9m adverse to prior year due to higher pension costs, pay awards
and increased headcount. and

* Higher non staff costs of £5.6m due to increased IT costs mainly Horizon, timing of
‘marketing spend, and the removal of the FX bureau rebate received in H1 last year partially
offeet by the increaced VAT recovery rate this year.

Offset by:

+ Agents costs £15,0m favourable variance to POL: £9.3m due to lower sales, predominantly
Mails buy forward pre price increase, £2.5m lower fixed pay from unfreezing the Core Tier
Payment and rall aut of Locals and £3.2m accrual release relating to the DVLA rate
changes,

+ Lower IB of £4.4m favourable to prior year, due to services switching into POL from RM.
and,

* Higher JV income of £0.8m,

Non like for like favourable variance of £2.4m was due to:

* Lower project costs of £6.0m, and

* Lower Network payment of £3.6m.

Summary

+ Income £2.7m less than plan.

+ Costs are £0.1m less than plan:

+ FYF is £2.0m adverse to budget reflecting the lower Mails income.

+ Staff overspend due to delays in CTP partially offset by savings from industrial action,
+ Other Mainly driven by favourable variance in POOC as a result of separation costs moving to exceptional spend.

The impact of size based pricing has adversely impacted Mails as follows: Priority Mails £0.3m, 1st class and 2nd class £1.0m, International Standard £0.6m are products most impacted by PIP. Retail
sales are also underperforming against target by £0.1m. The expectation is that the gap will reduce with the roll out of remedial actions, including the delivery of the ‘shoebox’.

Main drivers of favourable Government income are UK Visa & Immigration (UKVI) (due to backlog in applications) £0.8m, ID Services £0.3m and Passports £0.2m, offset by Motorist services (DVLA Licences
and AEl) which are £0.4m behind target.

Financial Services now performing just above target following reduction in savings budget.

YTD Staff Costs are on budget
Staff costs have returned to budget in P7 mainly because the Q2 sales bonus was below
budget reflecting lower sales. The budget for the managers’ lump sum pay award is covering
the shortfall in efficiency savings but this will unwind if a pay offer is made. The Cost
Reduction Programme is implementing a series of savings activities to drive the cost down ~
most will impact on 2014-15 with minor savings coming through in 2013-14.

Vs. Prior Year
‘The staff costs are £2,9m adverse to prior year including the impact of the higher IAS19
pension rate reflecting market conditions at March 2013, pay increases and higher bonus,
incentives costs.

Headcount of 8,028 is 44 below plan and is due to vacancies within the Network directorate,
both Crowns and transformation projects. The adverse variance in Financial Services continues
as the remaining FSs should all move over from Network by the end of period 8.

Vs. prior year headcount has increased by 179 primarily due to NTP and separation
strengthening,

Note: The budget is flat for all directorates, with only the Crown savings being the difference
between each month,

Variance Non Staff by Type

Non Staff by Directorate YTD non people costs were £1.4m favourable to budget
commer and £5,6m adverse to prior year.
*

‘ther Operating Costs
ee

Vs. Budget
‘The favourable position is driven by £3.7m VAT recovery
relating to H1 for changes in the VAT recovery rate, but
‘masks the underiying adverse variance due to Horizon
costs originally budgeted for in the prior year and adverse
property costs. RM costs are now treated as non staff
following the IPO and we believe there are still some costs
to come through. The adverse Network costs are Property
costs which are no longer within IB, but now non staff.

Vs. Prior Year
Higher non staff costs of £5.6m due to increased IT costs
‘mainly Horizon, timing of marketing spend, and the
removal of the FX bureau rebate received in H1 last year
partially offset by the increased VAT recovery rate this
year.

* Skills group is the internal ‘consultancy’ providing project resource made up of a
mixture of employees topped up with contractors. If demand is high the contractor
spend increases but this is offset by higher recharges to projects.

Income Variance £m 113 3.05 4.18 16.01bn @9th Oct

Savings - In October the book increased to £16.06bn, a slight increase on September. On 18" October we
launched “hero” rate Premier Cash Isa (1.80%) and Reward Saver (1.60%) products with fixed tranches of
£500m and £250m respectively; these are appearing in best-buy tables and rates should not change until the
tranche is filled. This launch has coincided with our fixed rates also becoming best buy generating a very
noticeable uplift in branch volumes. There will be media and branch support through November to support
drive branch volumes for PCISA and Reward Saver.

Mortgages

We achieved £166m of mortgage applications in October, (YTD £806m of applications) the best performance in
18 months. Mortgage Specialists contributed £10.7m of applications which was their strongest monthly
performance to date. We anticipate strong growth in mortgage applications through Mortgage Specialists in
January when the majority of our new sales team will have completed their training and we are through the
seasonal decline in December.

Credit Card

Whilst still behind YTD target the performance of credit card has started to show some signs of improvement
and is now 90% of target and 107% against previous year. The recent improvement has been across all
channels but predominantly via the online channel where the start to submit rate has improved from
approximately 38% pre-launch of new online application form to 54% and is still growing. The key issue is that
the traffic to the credit card site has been in dedine for a number of months. We have increased marketing
support, particularly through online channels; however, our new credit card balance transfer (BT) offer of 18
months is not competitive enough. Over a number of months our competitors have improved their BT offers,
but in the last month alone we have seen Barclaycard increase their BT offer to 30 months and Tesco Bank,
Nat West and Halifax to 28 months

POL00027506
POL00027506

Life Insurance - sales remain below budget and consequently actions are required if we are to achieve our
income plan. A DRTV Press and In Branch campaign will run in Q4 with a central theme of “always paying your
way and settling your tab”.

General Insurance - Motor Insurance sales volumes remain ahead of target but reliance on aggregators
continues to impact income, while improved retention rates offset some of the additional aggregator costs.
Home Insurance sales are down year to date due to aggressive competitor pricing through aggregators.

Profitability of our general insurance business has been significantly enhanced following the conclusion of a new
supply agreement with BISL.

Travel Money - sales income is below target due to lower than plan transactional volumes. The average
transaction value, however, is higher than budget so this will result in a higher profit share from FRES. The
channel sales performance remains on target as these are based upon sales value (benefiting from increased
ATV) rather than the sales volume.

Current Account

As at 8 November the proof of concept generated 1,722 applications which have converted to 883 sales (with
a further c.85 currently in referral). Last week was our best week for Current Account sales since launch, with
57 sales representing a 90% increase on the previous 5 weeks (average of 30 sales). This performance was
driven by the current marketing campaign and increased focus from the sales team. With this momentum we
expect sales volume will reach 1,000 in December.

2. Government Pillar update

Income Variance £m 0.91 -0.55 0.35

Passport Check and Send continues with a strong performance and volumes remain at 107% of forecast YTD.
After a spike of applications at the beginning of the year sales have returned close to forecast volumes. Despite
there being more than 200,000 additional passport applications YTD over last year market share YTD is down
on last year’s. In short Post Office is not exploiting the increased number of overall applications this year but
artificially doing well against forecast because of them. A Google paid advertising campaign was undertaken
throughout October and other marketing activities are being planned for Q3 and Q4. However, with Network
Field Team Support, the biggest impact on transaction volumes will be achieved by utilising the “Check & Send
Sales Conversation” to uplift conversions at Point of Sale.

Mails

Our Standard income is down by 13% against target, As of Week 31, the new smal parcel sizing has been in
place for one week and we are expecting to see volume steadily increase with an anticipated 225k parcels
coming back to POL per week to help hit our Standard income targets. The new sizing is currently being
POL00027506
POL00027506

advertised through online seller websites (eBay and Amazon) and Out Of Home advertising, targeting specific
high performing Mails branches that have dipped in performance since April.

Focus products income has remained steady with 3 out of our 4 Focus products (express24&48, International
Express, International Priority) increasing sales volumes compared to the previous year. Currently we are
slightly behind our Focus products target income, to mitigate this impact we have put in place product branch
promotions, ATL advertising alongside staff incentives to get this back on track over Christmas.

Lottery - down by -£3.8m vs. budget and last year, driven by Camelot’s decline in market sales and poor
performance of the new terminals following their 3rd licence extension. Since the recent Lotto game re-launch,
Lotto sales have increased by +33% versus the average 13 weeks prior to launch, although this is in the context
of a game in decline, so the sales growth has been low. Post Office has requested for Camelot to support with
specific Post Office promotions and unique products to drive sales growth through the branch network. Camelot
has declined to support Post Office with this initiative, rather focusing on their Camelot ‘brand’ activity. Post.
Office will roll out new ‘jackpot’ posters into agency branches, along with running POTV ‘jackpot’ ads in Crown
branches from late November.

Post Office launched The Health Lottery in mid-September, delivering average weekly sales revenue of £130k,
£6.5k income.

Retail (Crown only) - down by -£146k versus budget. Retail is down due to a decline in packaging sales, in line
with the decline in standard mails volumes. Strong promotional plans will be delivered in November and
December through a Collectibles catalogue proposition, new PostPak packaging and a seasonal Christmas wrap,
tags and cards offer.

4. Telecoms Pillar update

Income

Income Variance £m 0.49 0.09059 I Tbh Stner pAb eveHte is 460,245

The YTD HomePhone, HomePhone Combined and Broadband performance continues to be behind target.
The targets continue to ramp up as it was intended that post-migration we would be in a position to take
advantage of the new products we have available and drive an uplift in sales. Given the continued issues within
the call centre that are particularly impacting existing customers’ experience, the network are not actively
promoting the product and sales therefore continue to be behind plan. However, we are seeing a small increase
in the underlying run-rate. The focus continues to be on stabilising the customer experience for our existing
customers to maintain the customer base. Given the current issues and the other commercial imperatives
within the wider portfolio, it has been decided that we will not run a campaign in Q4 but will work with
Marketing Communications to deliver a re-launch of the product in Q1. This will not have a material impact on
2013/14 income but will have an impact in 2014/15.

E Top-up performance is running at 8% below target and is in line with market performance. There is no
appetite from the mobile networks to promote the category at the moment. At an income level, we continue to
be slightly ahead of plan due to a higher than planned average commission rate.

POST OFFICE LTD EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE

Energy — Noting Paper

1. Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to:

1.1. Update the Executive Committee (ExCo) on the development of the Post
Office Ltd (POL) energy proposition.

1.2. Seek agreement from ExCo on the recommended way forward.

2. Background

2.1. POL explored options for entry into the energy market in 2012. This is part of
our broader strategy to become a retailer of Post Office branded products and
services, which will extend to Mobile phones and developing our HomePhone
offering. Energy will become a key part of the HomeServices proposition that
we will offer under the Customer Value Proposition structure.

2.2. I Options for market entry included POL acting as an online aggregator across
the home energy market and/or POL options for partnering with one of the big
six energy companies to sell energy including a white label arrangement As it
stands our white-label proposition will deliver contribution in-line with the
Strategy Plan and provides the flexibility to enter into other arrangements with
the partner including POL having its own energy licence.

2.3. In June 2013 ExCo decided to support the white-label option. (See Annex 1
and 2 for P&L and commercials). As a white label provider POL could earn up
to £14m per year in revenue (revenue which is baked in to the strategic plan
and expected to rise to £24m by 2020 subject to future development of the
proposition). The overall cost of developing this solution is £1.05m.

2.4. I Since then, we have initiated a sourcing process and have progressed to a
shortlist of three potential energy providers with whom POL intends to have
more detailed discussions over the next few weeks.

2.5. Our plan has been to identify a preferred partner in December 2013 and then
launching a proposition in July 2014.

2.6. To date we have invested £83k in developing the energy proposition and have
a clear process in place.

3. Recent Developments
3.1. Whilst there is negative press about above-inflation energy price increases
every year (typically in the autumn), this year the volume of press coverage

and the public discontent has been stoked by growing political dissatisfaction
with the situation.

Post Office Energy Martin George Page 1 of 5 November 2013
POL00027506
POL00027506

Confidential

3.2. Having progressed the selection process to this point, we have identified that
the sales compliance obligations are more onerous than initially anticipated.

3.3. In addition POL has been directly approached by government to consider
assisting them by participating in the energy market.

4. Implications of recent developments

4.1. POL has become more concerned about brand reputational risks given limited
control around pricing.

° For example, if our partner decided to increase prices, then we in turn
would have to increase prices to our customers.

4.2. Increased clarity around sales compliance and the training required has called
into question our ability to sell this product end-to-end or promote and quote in
branch outside of the FS Specialists.

5. Proposed way forward
5.1. Asa result of this we are going to pursue two parallel streams of activity:

5.2. _ The first stream of activity is to continue with the white-label option and to find
ways to overcome the two challenges previously stated, reputational risk and
sales compliance.

5.3. I The second stream of activity will be to further investigate alternative options
for entering the energy market.

5.4. I White label: We are evaluating a number of options that will help us mitigate
the potential risks of adverse publicity caused by the white-label option. These
include:

. Partner Selection: In selecting our partner we are looking for the
energy company that has the greatest pricing discipline, is transparent,
and offers the best customer service.

° Education: We can use our face-to-face capability to educate
customers around energy savings, access to Eco (help with insulating
the home for the vulnerable in society), etc.

e Developing excellent customer service: Unlike any other energy
retailer we will be able to offer a face-to-face customer experience,
coupled with excellent online and phone customer service.

. Product Bundling: Whilst the regulations do not allow us to offer a
discount, we will look to bundle products together (as per the CVPs) to
offer customers excellent value for money.

. Gaining a Licence: Building flexibility into the contract to allow POL at
some point in the future to apply for an energy licence, which would
give us control over pricing.

. Customer Insight: All of this will be supported by customer research
that will provide insight into the key drivers of satisfaction, helping us to
shape a proposition that is genuinely different and meets customers’
needs.

5.5. We are also evaluating a number of approaches to mitigate the risks around
selling in branch: These include:

Post Office Energy Martin George Page 2 of 5 November 2013
POL00027506
POL00027506

Confidential

. Sales Compliance: We will continue to work closely with potential
suppliers to understand the ways that they can help us to ensure sales
compliance in branch. This includes what training they can provide,
scripting sales on Horizon and other systems—based measures to
ensure compliance.

. Mystery Shopping: Conduct mystery shopping in conjunction with our
partner to ensure compliance.
. Risk: We will discuss with partners how we share the risk associated

with selling energy in branch.

Alternative options: We will investigate other options for entering the energy
market. The aggregator model is an option that we will be exploring in detail.

5.6. HMG approached POL to ask for support in hosting independent energy
advisors in some of its branches while also stocking leaflets which advise
customers how to switch to cheaper energy tariffs. POL responded positively
to this request and promised to investigate the possibility of doing both. POL
recognised an opportunity to go much further than the initial request from
HMG by potentially acting as an aggregator across all of the main energy
companies helping to ensure that customers can easily act upon the advice
they get from the energy advisors by switching their provider through POL, in
branch or online. POL suggested this to HMG to gauge an initial response.
The response was encouraging.

5.7. In brief POL with a suitable partner would build a comparison engine which
would allow it to identify the cheapest available tariff for a customer and help
make it easier for customers to switch. We would initially offer an online
service with the possibility of using tablets or FS laptops in branch for branch
sales. POL would also gather expressions of interest from customers in
branch who could then receive a call back from a call centre or an email link to
the online service. The branch offer could dovetail nicely with the independent
energy advisors. POL could also seek to train its FS population in making end
to end sales and acting as independent advisors. POL would be paid by the
energy company every time a switch is made to their tariff.

5.8. I This type of service would allow POL to become the customer champion in
the energy market as POL would be independently finding the best price for
the customer. HMG could mandate all of the energy companies to make their
products available through POL as a way of achieving their stated aim of
increasing competition and holding down prices. Were these scenarios to play
out POL would have a compelling offer to step into the market combined with
greatly reduced risk around brand and reputational damage.

6. Risks

6.1. Risks with the aggregator approach:

. Energy companies may seek to remove bill payment from POL to try
and prevent customers from entering branch and making a switch.
e HMG may not be prepared to mandate the energy companies to sell

through the POL aggregator service; this could reduce the compelling
nature of the proposition.

. There may be competition issues with existing switching services,
these will need to be investigated and understood.

6.2. Risks with the white-label option:
. As highlighted, there are a number of risks with POL launching an

energy product. These include the potential that it might attract
negative publicity and brand reputational risk combined with issues
around sales compliance.

7. Next Steps

7.1... We have given ourselves four weeks to consider options and provide a
recommended way forward.

7.2. At this point we will have a greater understanding of the ways to mitigate the
risks associated with the white-label options and the potential that other
options might offer.

7.3. We will then provide a recommendation on the best way forward via the Spark
Programme Board and update ExCo accordingly.

8. Recommendations

The Executive Committee is asked to:

8.1. Support the recommended approach.

POST OFFICE LTD BOARD
Personal Injury Referral Fees Update

Purpose

1.1. The Board asked management to provide an update on the impact of the ban on
referral fees for Personal Injury (Pl) claims, how this has affected Post Office
customers and the market and how the changes are managed within BGL/Junction,
Post Office’s motor insurance broker.

1.2. The Paper is tabled for noting.

2. Background

2.1. In September 2011 the Government announced a ban on referral fees in relation to
personal injury claims in an attempt to curb the “compensation culture” and reduce
motor insurance premium inflation.

2.2. In anticipation of these changes Post Office Insurance undertook a review of the
practices employed by BGL and its legal firm, Minster Law, to ensure that Post Office
customers were receiving the appropriate service and that agents were not
incentivised to make inappropriate referrals. The review concluded that:

° Incentives were effectively monitored and dis-incentives were in place for
inappropriate referrals;

° Call quality monitoring was in place that provided effective and consistent on-
going evaluation of call centre agent performance.

2.3. Aseparate audit completed by Post Office Insurance concluded that:

. Appropriate controls were in place, and these controls are being managed
effectively so the risk of inappropriate referrals as a direct result of the incentive
program was felt to be low and managed;

° Further audit and monitoring activity would be conducted on a regular basis to
provide on-going assurance. These have occurred and no issues have arisen.

3. Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 (LASPO)

3.1. In April 2013 the ban of referral fees was implemented under LASPO. Provisions in
part two of LASPO make it a regulatory offence to pay or receive referral fees in
personal injury cases. This directly affects insurers, solicitors and claims
management businesses and is under the monitoring of the Solicitors Regulation
Authority, Financial Conduct Authority and Claims Management Authority.

3.2. Since the implementation of LASPO, The AA British Insurance Premium Index has
reported a decline in car premiums of c10 percent. This is the largest and most
prolonged (6 consecutive months) fall in car insurance premiums since the index
began in 1994 and is heavily influenced by the changes to Pl management. This
suggests that the market has responded as anticipated to the regulatory changes.

3.3. Over the same period, the percentage of reported Post Office motor insurance
claims resulting in a PI claim has remained relatively static - supporting the good
working practises noted at BGL. The income per motor insurance policy to Post
Office in respect of the claims service has, however, declined from £10 to £3,
equating to c£1.5 million of lost revenue to Post Office in 2013/14.

3.4. The reduction in market premiums has led to improving retention rates to Post Office
(up 3 percent) and margins ameliorating to some extent the decline in income.

Post Office Ltd — Strictly Confidential

4. Audit of Junction/BGL

4.1. Recent audits have confirmed that the incentive programs used by BGL/Minster Law
remain unchanged following LAPSO and based upon previous work Post Office
remains satisfied that they do not unduly influence referral rates.

4.2. In October, Post Office Insurance concluded a re-negotiation of the contract with
BGL. The new arrangements enshrined specific provisions to enable audits of the
BGL operations and work practises. This will enable Post Office to ensure that
customers continue to receive an appropriate and relevant service.

5. Conclusion

5.1. The consequence of changes in regulation pertaining to referral fees has had the
desired effect on the market. The impact on income from claims management has
diminished leading to a decline in the number of claims management firms.

5.2. Insurers have lowered rates, allowing consumers to enjoy lower car insurance
premiums.

5.3. A reduction in Post Office income has largely been recovered by increasing volumes
and margins.

5.4. Audits of BGL/Junction incentive schemes and operating model confirm that Post
Office customers are not being incentivised to unnecessarily seek PI referrals.
6. Recommendation

6.1. The Board is asked to note the paper.

POST OFFICE LTD BOARD
Financial Services and Crown Incentive Schemes

1. Purpose

1.1 At the meeting of the Board in July 2013, directors asked management to
provide an overview of the review by Mercer Ltd (“Mercers”) of the financial
services branch incentive program, and provide an update on actions. The
review was subsequently extended to cover all Crown incentive schemes, and
other relevant Network Sales schemes.

1.2 The paper provides this update and also sets out the overall incentive proposals
across Financial Services (FS) and Crown sales (Crown).

1.3 This is a joint FS and Network & Sales paper and is tabled for noting.

2. Background

21 Key to building FS sales capability is that the incentives for their sale promote
and reward appropriate behaviour and compliant selling.

2.2 It is also critical to ensure that the incentive scheme meets the increasing
requirements of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) that such programs drive
outcomes that satisfy customers’ needs.

2.3 Post Office employed Mercers, a specialist remunerations consulting firm, to
review the current incentive schemes and make appropriate recommendations.
While the initial work related specifically to Financial Specialists (FSs), due to the
inter-relationship with the Crown Network, the scope was widened to cover
Crown incentives and the wider Network where financial services sales occur.

24 There are currently incentive schemes running in the FS network; the Crown
network; and the Agency network and WHSmiths for the Sales Managers
employed by POL.

2.5 We looked to make changes to the FS scheme last year. Whilst the Union
(CWU) supported these changes, it was rejected by the FS under ballot.

3. Key Findings from Mercers

3.1 Mercers concluded that the current FS sales incentive program is not fit-for-
purpose and does not recognise or differentiate between effective and non-
effective performance (either in the quality of the sales process or in its
outcome). For example:

. FSs can receive a bonus despite not having hit their targets based on the
wider branch performance; only 5 percent of the 2012/13 incentive paid
related to financial services sales;

. Strong and weak individual performance does not result in a materially
different bonus outcome;

° The current structure is focused solely on sales volumes, with no
requirement for compliance or customer satisfaction;

. FSs are part of a number of schemes and they generally do not understand
the logic of all the schemes they are in and how their performance can
result in each of the bonus payments.

3.2 Mercers are of the view that the current incentive program would likely be
deemed non-compliant by the FCA. However, it is so in-effective that it does not
encourage appropriate selling.

FS Incentive Scheme Prepared by Nick Kennett Page 1 of 5 13 November 2013
POL00027506
POL00027506

Strictly Confidential

3.3. The weakness of the current program has been evident in savings:

° Over 54 percent of all FS’ sales are savings products, which are rate
dependent and often ‘sell themselves’;

. When interest rates are less competitive, overall FS sales performance
falls significantly, confirming that FSs focus on this ‘easy sell’, rather than
engaging with customers on their wider needs.

3.4 Mercers strongly recommended that the current program be withdrawn and
replaced. They were also of the view that their conclusions and concerns were
applicable to other schemes operating in the Network.

4. New incentive schemes

41 The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has indicated that it is looking for financial
institutions to set incentive schemes to be focused on behaviours or satisfaction.
While some banks (e.g. Barclays) have stated that they are implementing a
model based solely on customer satisfaction, this would not be appropriate for
the Post Office as the business has little history of driving sales outcomes. A
hybrid model was therefore proposed by Mercers and is being implemented.

4.2 The new incentive schemes have been developed in conjunction with Mercers;
they will be aligned and implemented across the new financial services sales
network, into Crown branches and across the broader Network where
appropriate.

4.3 The key components of the scheme are:

. Financial services compliance and quality of sales will be a ‘gateway’; if
compliance standards are not met no bonus will be payable for the period.

. Area level roles will be scorecard driven. Whilst scorecards are already
used for Crown Area Managers, we are significantly changing the
weighting and aligning them for all Area teams. The scorecard itself covers
three components — customer services delivery, profit (both 40 percent)
and staff engagement (20 percent). Each individual on a score card
scheme is given a score out of 100 percent. They are then ranked against
their applicable peers and then given a PDR rating accordingly, which will
determine their incentive payment.

° Branch manager roles will also continue to align to customer service
delivery, profit outcomes and staff engagement. The weightings of these
will change significantly.

. Individual seller roles will operate on a matrix payment structure and be
aligned to customer service delivery and relevant sales outcomes.

. The non-financial services schemes (e.g. Mails specialists) will have a
compliance gateway and then operate on a matrix payment structure,
driven by performance and customer service.

. For the Crown network, appropriate schemes will be aligned to the Crown
P&L objectives and will be factored up or down based on Crown P&L
performance. Currently Crown Area Managers are factored up or down
based on POL profitability.

. Incentive rewards will be paid as a fixed amount and not a percentage at
the end of each quarter for individual sellers and at the end of the financial
year for Area level roles.

4.4 The key measure are:

FS Incentive Scheme Prepared by Nick Kennett Page 2 of 5 13 November 2013
POL00027506
POL00027506

Strictly Confidential

. A number of the following measures already exist for Crown Area
Managers and Branch Managers, however this is about ensuring they are
aligned across roles and the weighting is significantly changed.

° Customer service delivery will assess customers satisfaction based on
Voice of the customer (VOC), Customer waiting time and retail standards.
The weightings on these vary across the different schemes. These have
been measures in some schemes previously and they will now be used
across all schemes and have a greater weighting.

. Profit is measured using controllable costs and income generated from
sales performance. This measure is used in all relevant schemes.

e Rather than measuring sales targets, individuals are targeted with
customer benefit measures (CBMs). The CBM targets will be set and the
number will be achieved by adding multipliers to each product set. The
higher multipliers are a reflection of a number of factors including income to
the business, product journey time for the FS and customer and the go-
forward strategy of the business. It is envisaged that this will change and
drive appropriate selling behaviours, improving the customer experience
whilst returning the business to a profitable, self-financing structure.

. Employee engagement; all Post Office employees complete the annual
team engagement survey and area/regional managers will receive a score
based on their team feedback from the survey.

45 An example of an individual seller scheme is:

. If the quarterly CBM for an FS is 242 points and 150% of sales target
achieved and the 150% customer stretch target met, the FS could earn up
to £1,875 for that quarter (potentially £7,500 for the year against a salary of
circa £21,000- £23,000).

Stretch

4.6 Whilst the final payment levels have not been agreed/signed-off, the basic
principle is that we are looking to stretch the performance curve so that top
performers get greater rewards and under performers are not rewarded. Whilst
we have not yet agreed payment amounts, we are currently modelling to reward
individuals on the following basis:

° Area roles - between £0 - £25,000 per year.

. Branch manager — between £0 - £12,500 per year.

. Individual seller roles FS - between £0 - £12,000 per year.
. Product specialist roles - between £0 - £2,750 per year.

FS Incentive Scheme Prepared by Nick Kennett Page 3 of S 13 November 2013
POL00027506
POL00027506

Strictly Confidential

. Customer Service Consultants - between £0 - £2,500 per year.
47 The schemes have been shared with the Bank of Ireland (UK) plc, who as Post
Office’s principal has shared the key components with the FCA.
5. Governance

5.1 The schemes are being signed-off by a project Steering Group and an ExCo
Sub-Group.

5.2 Once the schemes are implemented it is important that they are reviewed
regularly to ensure they are meeting their objectives.

5.3 A terms of reference is being created for a review steering group (ExCo Sub-
Group) to meet quarterly.
6. Implementation timings
6.1 The aspirational timing of scheme launches has been prioritized as follows:

. 1 October 2103 - FS & Crown Area Mangers and Mortgage Specialists
(done).

. 1 January 2014 — remaining Crown & FS roles.

. 1 April 2014 - Agency Area Sales teams and WHSmiths Area teams.
6.2 The above timings will be reviewed in light of the IR landscape.

7. Commercial Impact/Costs

7.1 In the first year of operation aggregate payments on the new incentive scheme
will be similar to the current business plan. Thereafter the scheme will be self-
financing as it drives increased sales, while poor performance is un-rewarded.

7.2 If the scheme were to pay out considerably more it would be due to a significant
over performance and the uplift in income would significantly outweigh the cost.

8. Industrial Relations

8.1 We looked to make changes to the FS scheme last year. Whilst the Union
(CWU) supported these changes, it was rejected by the FS under ballot.

8.2 We have sought to actively engage both the CMA and the CWU on these
changes:

. CWU has collective bargaining rights over: Financial Specialists, Product
Specialists and Customer Service Consultants;

. CMA has collective bargaining rights over: FS Area Managers, Mortgage
Specialists, Branch Managers and Assistant Branch Managers.

. FS Regional Managers and Crown Area Managers and not covered by
collective bargaining.

8.3. The CMA is fully engaged and a joint statement with Post Office for the schemes
launched on 1° October. Post Office and CMA have agreed to engage in regular
meetings to ensure that the schemes meet business and staff needs.

8.4 To date the CWU has refused to respond to requests to meet on incentive
schemes. We continue to seek to arrange meeting are send them the
appropriate documentation that we would have given them if we had met.

POL00027506

8. Key Risks

8.1 Under the existing collective arrangements, a new incentive scheme requires
concurrence from the trade unions.

8.2 While the CWU continues to refuse to engage on incentive programs,
management is considering whether it can and should deploy the schemes
identified in 6 above, ahead of engagement with CWU. This will be determined
by the wider IR implications.

9. Conclusion

9.1 Existing incentive schemes are not fit-for-purpose and need to be replaced.

9.2 The new schemes will create a best-practice structure, putting the needs of the
customer at the heart of sales measurement; it will recognise and reward strong
sales performance, discriminating against poor performance and will align Crown
branches to the delivery of the financial services and wider business strategies.

POST OFFICE LTD BOARD

Update on FM and Grapevine Procurement

1. Purpose
The Post Office board are asked to note that:

1.1. Post Office Ltd (POL) intends to progress to the next stage of procuring Facilities
Management (FM) and security and alarm (Grapevine) services by issuing an
Invitation To Tender (ITT) to the market on 29 November 2013. This will facilitate
separation from Royal Mail (RM) in accordance with the Master Services
Agreement (MSA) with RM.

2. Background

2.1. The MSA places an obligation on POL to source separate FM and Grapevine
services which are currently provided by RM through circa 100 separate RM
contracts. Romec (a joint venture between RM and Balfour Beatty Workplace’) is
the predominant supplier.

2.2 POL pays £29.5m p.a. for these services: £26m for FM; £3.5m for Grapevine
services; and an overhead/management charge to Royal Mail of £1.1m.

2.3 It is anticipated that securing new contracts will save POL c20% against current
costs.

2.4 Although POL has completed the Pre-Qualification Questionnaire (PQQ) stage of
procurement it has been unable to inform the market of short-listed bidders or to
issue ITTs. This is due to RM’s delay in the provision of detailed information
required to assess potential liabilities (including pension liabilities) under TUPE
(Transfer of Undertakings [Protection of Employment]) legislation.

2.5 Following escalation to, and various discussions at, director level, RM have
recently released the information enabling POL to go to market on 29 November
2013 with an anticipated start date for the new contract(s) of 14 July 2014.

2.5 The data from RM indicates that c400 personnel are deployed in support of POL.
The MSA limits POL’s exposure to liabilities related to TUPE to 116 staff providing
FM and Grapevine services with POL indemnified by RM for the remainder.

3. Activities/Current Situation

3.1 The FM tender offers lots as follows:

e Lot 1 Hard services (maintenance / engineering, and fabric maintenance) -

current charge is c£20m pa.

e¢ Lot 2 Soft services (cleaning, security, pest control, grounds maintenance,
waste, office management services) - current estimated charge is c£5m.
Lot 3 Catering (including vending and hospitality) - current charge is c£500k.
Lot 4 Helpdesk (including room booking services) - current charge is c£500k.
Lot 5 All above services combined.
Grapevine is offered to the market as a single lot including alarm monitoring,
key holding and intelligence services.

3.2 It is envisaged the minimum contract term will be 3 years plus 2 extensions of 2
years and bidders will be asked to provide costings on this basis.

3.3 POL will progress to market on the basis that bidders can rely on an element of
indemnification from POL with regard to liabilities on the basis that the risk will be
shared with the supplier. POL will rely on the indemnity provided by the MSA to
manage this risk although the administration of this activity has the potential to be
onerous and costly for POL. NB: The MSA limits the availability of the RM
indemnity in respect of liabilities associated with staff exits to a period of 3 months
following commencement of the new service.

3.4 Total potential liabilities for POL and RM are around £12m although the indications
are that the new provider will need to retain between 60% to 80% of existing staff,
suggesting liabilities of between £2.4m and £4.8m.

3.5 The delay in securing new contracts may result in a loss of benefits of £1.3m in FY
14/15. In this case POL will seek to negotiate to recover the loss from RM although
it should be noted there is no provision in the MSA that permits this course of
action. There is also a danger of reciprocal action so any negotiations on this
matter will proceed cautiously and with the broader context in mind.

4. Options Considered

4.1 Do Nothing. The MSA mandates separation from RM and therefore we are unable
to continue to draw services from RM.

4.2 Agree an extension of service with RM. RM is unwilling to extend service provision
beyond that which has been caused by the delay in providing data and to which
POL is entitled under the MSA.

5. Risks/Mitigation

5.1. RM may contest POL’s position on the indemnification of liabilities as specified in
the MSA leaving POL with a potential risk of £4.8m. POL believes the MSA is clear
and will defend this position robustly. However negotiations are underway with a
view to RM buying out its liability and indemnity in the MSA. This will make the
administration of indemnification easier and more cost effective for all parties. POL
is aiming to conclude this negotiation by the end of November 2013.

5.2 Suppliers choose not to bid when the details and constraints of the indemnification
under the MSA are understood. The /TT will be structured to encourage suppliers
to manage the re-organisation in such a way as to enable POL to enforce the
MSA. However, in the event that the supplier finds it is unable to work under the
constraints of the MSA then POL could accept a greater share of the potential
liability. In addition, the shortlisted bidders are long-standing and reputable
providers in the industry fully aware of the mechanisms available to them to
ensure compliance with the relevant legislation and achieve the aims of POL
under the MSA.

5.3 Romec re-organises to increase the resource associated with the provision of
service to POL and in turn increases the TUPE liabilities. POL has put in place a
Change Control regime with RMG/Romec to prevent this. Additionally, under the
MSA the liabilities for POL are limited to 116 staff. Therefore RM will simply be
increasing their own liabilities if staff numbers in support of POL are increased.

5.4 Service levels will diminish when Romec are informed of their failure to progress to
the next stage of the procurement. POL has received assurances from RM that in
the event Romec are not confirmed as a shortlisted bidder service levels will be
maintained.

5.5 There are further delays in the procurement process. POL has a robust plan which
will be tightly managed and controlled.

5.6 Reputational damage / industrial action could result from the exit of staff as a
consequence of the new contract(s). The risk of reputational damage results from
the provisions within the MSA relating to the timescales for staff exit and RM
funding for those exits. The risk lies primarily with RM rather than POL as the
Romec staff are part of an RM JV. Equally, any industrial action would be more
likely to be taken against RM / Romec rather than POL as POL has no direct
relationship with Romec staff. However, depending on the nature of any potential
industrial action taken by Romec staff, POL may suffer some operational
disruption. In this circumstance POL would work closely with Romec on initiating
its contingency plan.

6. Request of the Board

6.1. POL is obliged to separate the FM and Grapevine services from RM and needs to
progress to market to achieve savings against current RM charges. Despite the
delays caused by RM, POL will progress to market in November 2013 due to the
lack of realistic alternatives. The Board is asked to note the plan to issue ITTs for
the FM and Grapevine tenders at the end of November 2013.

ExCo Meeting 22 October - Actions and Decisions
22/10/01 Decision 1 I Maypole
lf DWP accept the future interest rate as per the proposal, it was
decided that POL would take the interest rate risk. If however, the
assumed interest rates change during the negotiations this would
need to return to ExCo for further debate.
22/10/02 Decision 2. I Maypole
Support for holding agents pay flat and including the cost of doing so
in the costs to DWP.
22/10/03 Action 1 Maypole KS/SB End Oct

Model the effect of the POCA changes being proposed on the mains
and locals models including consideration of income and footfall and
highlight any move away from the assumptions in the strategic plan.

Update: We estimate that there could be 6.15m fewer POca
transactions in 2015/16, 28.8m fewer in 2016/17 and 11.6m fewer
in 2017/18. After this, our proposal is broadly in line with, or slightly
above, the Strategy Plan. This assumes that DWP migrates all
Universal Credit working age customers in that period. The preferred
option does not change the overall assumptions made in our Strategy
Plan in relation to Network Transformation, i.e. we do not envisage

that our proposed approach will have a specific impact on our roll-out
of Locals and Mains models over the longer term. However, this will
need to be further reviewed when the final picture emerges to test
the implications on the models, especially as the Locals model relies
on the Post Office generating footfall that delivers retail spend.
