John,

Giving the urgency of the matter and losses being linked to our branch manager year end bonus, could you push to get
this resolved.

Thanks

Hi Ish

Sorry but at the moment I can’t authorise this, but will hopefully be able to resolve once all avenues of investigation
have been exhausted. I wouldn’t want to write off this year, to only find the evidence supports the fact that the branch
carried out the transaction incorrectly, and then have to issue another TC asking for the money back again.

i know this is frustrating, but I am hopeful that we will resolve once and for ail, into your new financial year.

Thanks

John

John,

We are tidying up our losses accounts in preparation for our financial year end, in absence of any evidence received can
you arrange for a TC credit of £2704 to be issued.

Hi

I need an enhanced ARQ to interrogate Horizon records to determine if a debit card authorisation code was system
generated or manually input to Horizon for the above branch. The raw logs should indicate a referral message being
shown. See detailed requirement in e mail chain below.

Transaction date: - 23/10/12, 9.20, £2,703.95
Many thanks
