Hi Chris,

Answers below: -

1. No there won’t be an extra charge, Post Office pay for a set number of ARQ’s per year
and that includes witness statements, whether requested with the ARQ or separately.

« Yes each ARQ covers 1 calendar month.

. Yes the ARQ needs to be supplied via encrypted CD as this is wat has been agreed
historically, if you wish to change the method of delivery it would need to be agreed
formally between POL and Fujitsu, suggest you need to talk to POL ISAG (Information
Security Assurance Group) and progress that with a CR (Change Request) if you would
like it changed.

“GRO.

Jason,

A couple of quick questions;
1. If we request a statement subsequent to an ARQ request does that incur an extra charge?
2. Does each ARQ request a calendar month or just 30 days?
3. Does the data have to come on CD or could it be done on a pen drive?
