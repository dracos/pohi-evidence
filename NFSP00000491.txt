including Item 8(a) Television Licences & Paystation

@ Minor difficulties and differences of opinion over the
agreement with the Negotiating Committee on when
Nationwide came ‘on board’.

@ Not yet implemented but correct. I

@ Negotiating Committee had been resisting implementation
but were nearly in breach of the agreement with Post Office
Limited.

@  Hoped a greater number of Nationwide accounts were
serviced at Post Offices and that the Nationwide would have
advertised the facility far more than they had.

@ Post Office Limited did not achieve membership of LINK.

@ They have not given up, but banks now saying Post Office
are a competitor and maintaining it did not apply to ‘over the

( counter’ services.

@ Figures for Nationwide were slowly growing, but were not as
large as originally hoped. Subpostmaster remuneration had ¢
grown in terms of automated banking. .
@ The 0.9p reduction had not been recovered by increased
transaction numbers.
@ Reduction had been resisted for as long as possible, but
would have to be accepted.
@ Nationwide customers unaware that they could withdraw
cash at Post Offices, and as there was no publicity,
Subpostmasters should do their best to make the facility
known.
@ Figures for automated banking had been received across all
offices. In April 2005 it was £2.3 million, and by March 2006
had increased to £3.3 million demonstrating steady growth.
® Figures for Nationwide banking transactions to be circulated
to the Executive Council if the ‘commercially confidential’ flag

was removed by Post Office Limited. (ACTION
@ Lloyds and Barclays had never informed their customers of (
the availability of cash withdrawal at Post Offices either. \

e@ South West Water had sent letter to customers directing
them to Paypoint ‘to avoid the queues’. Subpostmasters in
the South West region could not afford to lose the work.

@ Copy of the letter given to Post Office Limited who were
running it past their Legal Department to see if something
could be done about it.

@ South West Water were pushing their customers to the
cheaper options, the same as the banks preferring
customers to use ATM’S.

@ Subpostmasters were not expensive themselves, however
the supporting infrastructure was.

@ Rate card to banks per transaction was 45p, which was 19p
more expensive than an ATM.

@ — Paypoint advertising on local radio in Yorkshire citing length
of queues in Post Offices and their availability ‘after hours’.

@ BT sending out letters selling Direct Debit and also citing
queues in Post Offices and ‘time is money’.

@ nPower issuing cards that would only swipe at Paypoint.
When customers call nPower they were being told it was
because Horizon was unreliable.

@ Federation did not like reply on BBC/Paypoint debate sent
out by Post Office Limited (included in EC Minutes 21.05.06).

@ Letter did not give the correct message as it did not complete
the full picture.

e@ TV licences were not a restricted product because Post
Office Limited did not think they would lose the contract,
therefore Subpostmaster in private capacity can accept
payment.

@ Sought clarification from Post Office Limited, letter now going
out with Dave Miller’s signature, not to the network as a
whole, only in response to specific questions from specific
Subpostmasters. la

@ Could break down big brand as we know it. x

@ Fear is that Subpostmasters would break their contracts, be
mystery shopped and if they were attempting, even
unknowingly, to take a bill payment it would be a breach of
contract.

@ Would be easy to say have a Paypoint terminal that does not
do bill payment or restricted services, however it would mean
on line top ups and TV licences could be done for the going
rate.

@ Negotiating Committee of the belief that it would not be
possible because Subpostmasters could not have one
without bill payment functionality.

@ Customers were receiving letters listing Paypoint premises,
some of them Post Offices. Post Office Limited have stated
they would react to these situations.

@ The Negotiating Committee had accused Post Office Limited
of not supporting the Federation, when the Federation had
supported big brand.

@ The General Secretary had met with the Chief Operating
Officer and pointed out that they had to do something about
the situation or there would be a divided network and
destruction of big brand.

@ = Paypoint were plugging the holes in their network, but most
Post Offices would not be granted a terminal. Any Post
Office taking a terminal would be adding credibility to
Paypoint and making them stronger when bidding for future I
bill payment contracts and replacement to the POCA. !

@ Paystation should be available to any Post Office that
wanted one, and some new contracts that have been gained
on top ups and electric key recharging has meant rolling out
an extension of the Paystation network to cover the areas of
the client base.

@ Quantum changing functionality and would soon not work on
Horizon.

@ The costs of making the necessary changes to Horizon
would outweigh the returns.

@ = It was commented that the BT bill payments could be the
next major contract up for renegotiation and could be lost.

@ Some Post Offices had applied for waivers under the
restrictions for their Paypoint/Payzone terminals. They
should be either removed at the end of the waiver or have
most functionality removed.

@ Spar and Co Op encouraging branches to take Paypoint,
including Post Offices.

@ Danger that the Paypoint network would become bigger than
the Post Office network.

@ Another network reinvention of some kind would accelerate
that process, therefore Subpostmasters should be
encouraged to operate a Paystation wherever possible.

@ Post Office Limited should chase the ‘big boys’ and stop
them using Paypoint.

@ Suggested that a Federation branded Paystation may be an
option.

stive Council Meeting ~~ 49-24 dune 2006 Page 10 of 35

Paypoint made a breakthrough with the BBC contract and
would now chase every contract that Post Office Limited had
at a level that Post Office would not want to take.

Post Office Limited lose money overall on bill payment.

Board decision was to stay in the market for 2 years then
review the situation.

Negotiating Committee would take whatever line the
Executive Council decided - to retain the business at
reduced priced or not to get the business at all.

Paystation would pay 7p per transaction and would not drive
core.

Horizon bill payment was currently 11.2p but would almost
certainly reduce to retain contracts.

Paystation contracts won were new work not traditionally
done on Horizon; Scottish Power including Manweb, nPower,
Yorkshire, Midland, Scottish and Southern Energy, Swalec.
Reduced payment believed to be 25p from client
(commercially confidential information) for bar coded bill but
doubtful that could be maintained. 19p from new contracts.
Key charging down to 15p and may drop below that level.
Frustrations of Executive Council to be raised at meeting
with Post Office Limited on 10 July as they do not appear to
be taking the matter seriously enough.

On bill payment the main issue was that market pressures
had created a situation where margins were no longer
available.

The loss of the BBC contract had partly been down to
arrogance on the part of Client Managers.

Post Office Limited Client Managers had not kept a good
relationship with their clients, and in the case of BT, Adam
Crozier had actually had to retrieve the situation.
Subpostmasters have indicated they would be prepared to
take a reduced transaction payment to remain in the bill
payment market.

Paystations need to be made available to every
Subpostmaster that wants one, to keep up the number of
outlets that Post Office Limited can claim when competing
against Paypoint.

7p payment would be above that received by Paypoint
agents.

If that rate does not retain the BT contract, at least Post
Office Limited will have tried.

If another major contract was lost to Paypoint there would be
little point in continuing.

Post Office Limited would need to reduce their central costs
to remain competitive in the market place.

Different Post Offices would be affected differently by the
loss of bill payment, but many would lose heavily particularly
urban deprived.

A situation regarding Manweb and Paystation was raised
and it was agreed to investigate the situation.

North East Region had debated whole issue of bill payment
and after much discussion felt that a payment between 7-8p
per transaction would be acceptable to keep the business,
however it would only be acceptable if Post Office Limited
took a similar reduction.

It would be signalled to Post Office Limited that any reduction
in remuneration for bill payment would have to part of a
package of measures, including (i) enforcement of
restrictions, (ii) more Paystations being made available, (iii)
reduction in Post Office Limited costs, and (iv) acceptance of
a reduction in Subpostmasters pay.

MR PEBERDY proposed ‘That a payment of no less than 7p
per transaction be negotiated for bill payment in order to
retain the business.’ The proposal was carried.

5. Network PC NW

, (a) Horizon Failures PC NW 06 01

Special sub Committee of the Negotiating Committee meet
representatives at Dearne on a regular basis.

Marilyn Stoddart and Lynda Willoughby have a good
relationship with the Post Office staff dealing with Horizon.
The failure after the Bank Holiday had been explained and
contrary to popular belief it was not caused by overload. It
was caused by an_ individual accidentally switching
something and messing up the system.

They were working on a solution whereby there is a back up
in case of failure.

The down time caused by failures was being reduced.
Negotiating Committee finding out about current situation
with the GSM solution to keep and office running in the case
of Horizon failure.

Printer failures highlighted as major frustration, and major
variations regionally on availability of replacements.

Post Office Limited looking at second generation Horizon,
and a reduction in costs from Fujitsu to retain the contract.
Some Horizon work sub-contracted and not all engineers
were trained to the same level, hence variation in service
levels.

Details of specific case raised by Mrs Bethell to be supplied
to Shoreham for follow up.
