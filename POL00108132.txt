Subject: Martin Griffiths/Sparrow

Angela, I wanted to ask the last couple of questions, copied to a different group.

This is such a tragic case and is likely to be much more complicated than it appears, or than Alan
Bates had chosen to see it initially. But because of Alan's reaction and of course the work we are
doing with Sparrow, we should be completely on the front foot - looking into it from a Sparrow
angle immediately:

+ as this case was in the process post the Second Sight interim report, were we handling it any
differently? And if so, are there records to show what/how?

+ had Glenn Chester, John Breedon, auditors, security and finance colleagues and any others who
were involved with Martin or his case, received any briefings about approaching such cases
differently than in the past? Ie., the cultural change flagged by the Second Sight report? I know
you have done some briefings but not sure how wide-spread.

* Should my questions above prompt us to look at any others any differently? And to revisit
colleague briefings?

+ I saw a note re letting James know, what about SS and Alan Bates?

Andy/Belinda, I will forward you the background.
Finally, I am happy to get answers to the above on Monday. It has been a very demanding week.
Thanks, Paula
