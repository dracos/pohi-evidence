. Compensation principles

Limitation — claims over 6 years old are generally irrecoverable at law.
Should settlements be offered on old claims?

Causation — At law, SPMRs need to show that their complaints have
actually caused, or at least materially contributed to, the losses
claimed. This is more difficult for claims relating to, say, a lack of
training and support. Should Post Office insist on evidence of
causation?

Remoteness - Peculiar or excessive losses that are unforeseeable to
POL may not recoverable at law. Should POL compensate these types
of losses?

Mitigation — At law, SPMRs are obliged to take reasonable steps to
reduce their losses. Should POL be looking for evidence of mitigation
before offering a settlement?
