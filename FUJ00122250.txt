2002 to the 28" February 2003 there were 28 calls from Rugeley Post Office - FAD Code

referrer to a “critical event”. The term critical is the comparative level of attention required to
generate remedial action. It refers to the level of attention required on a grading system for
example critical high level of attention or warning would be medium level of attention. These
critical events occurred outside the Post Office opening times and a standard action of a reboot
of the system, which would also highlight any further issues, was undertaken and repaired the
problem and confirmed stability of the system. The term bad block refers to an area of the hard
drive, which the operating system has identified as no longer useable for data storage. I should
add that this area is not my particular area of expertise. I have a general knowledge of these
procedures and have made the comments above to aid the court.

At various times on the 21st April 2006 hardcopy printouts of the 28 calls detailing the
information recorded on the helpdesk database for the required date period were produced. I
now produce the hardcopy printouts as Exhibit APD/01.

Any records to which I refer in my statement form part of the records relating to the business of
Fujitsu Services. These were compiled during the ordinary course of business from information
supplied by persons who have or may reasonably be supposed to have personal knowledge of
the matter dealt with in the information supplied, but are unlikely to have any recollection of the

information or cannot be traced. As part of my normal duties, I have access to these records.
