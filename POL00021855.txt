Agree with previous comments — lands the points effectively. A few tracked changes from me in attached...
of ‘minor’ but important ones included:

- Inthe section on evidence and analysis I’ve tweaked the words re “largely speculative” - can we say instead “it
lacks examples or statistics to substantiate speculative conclusions it does draw”. This gives us a useful point of
reference if report reaches public domain

- Refer to applicants not subpostmasters in penultimate para
