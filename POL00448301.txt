Subject: Project Pineapple - STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL

Dear All ,

Nick confirmed he had sent the confidential note to the Independent NEDs entitled Project Pineapple to Ben and
Martin amongst others . This note contained the private comments of our Post Master NED colleagues inter alia

on Ben and Martin .

Ihave suggested he immediately apologised to Elliot and Saf as this was a very serious incident as far as they and
other NEDs were concerned . Elliot and Saf were now exposed to further investigations from these two
individuals particularly in view of the fact that Investigations were " untouchable " ( to use Nick's words ) . I
suggested he apologised to all the NEDs at our private meeting before the Board which he is happy to do .

Nick said it was an accident resulting from the huge pressures on him . There is a lot on his mind including the
Investigation on him . He understands it was a serious lapse and was very apologetic .

Best , Henry
