In simple terms it wasn’t there.

¢ The branch should have had a £3k gain on the 18" April the day the cash was delivered as it was signed for
but not remmed into Horizon.

¢ I think that the gain was initially there in branch as the last cash declaration of the day on the 18" April
showed a gain of £2535.12.

e The previous the day the final cash declaration showed a loss of £611.33.

e The difference between the 2 being £3146.45.

¢ However, this gain appears to whittle away over a period of time until the branch is rolled over on the 5"

June.

Kim.

HiAl,

The audit and training took place as planned on the 25™ July.

POL00284503
POL00284503

The result was a £36.36 shortage in the cash and £869.88 gain in the stock, due to the branch incorrectly remming in

their stock.

This left a net position of £833.52 gain. Kevin was present in branch and was informed of the result.

Training was provided to all the staff present in branch particularly focussing on the problem areas, Branch Trading,

Stock Management Processes and Cash pouch processes.
POL00284503
POL00284503

The branch were also left with some hard copy training materials as reference.

I have copied Alison in as Branch Analysis Team will be keeping an eye on the branch particularly around stock
processes and completing their monthly Branch Trading Statement to timescales.

Thanks,
Kim.
