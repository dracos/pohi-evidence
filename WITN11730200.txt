POST OFFICE HORIZON IT INQUIRY

SECOND WITNESS STATEMENT OF CARL CRESWELL

I, Carl Creswell, will say as follows.

INTRODUCTION

1. I am Director, Post Office Policy and Business Engagement, in the Department
for Business and Trade. In this statement I refer to that Department and its
predecessors as “the Department”. I have prepared this ‘corporate’ statement
on behalf of the Department in response to the Inquiry’s request for evidence
dated 25 September 2024 (“the Rule 9 request’), in order to assist the Post
Office Horizon IT Inquiry in relation to the Department's role in providing redress

for those affected by the Horizon scandal.

2. I have prepared this statement with extensive support of Departmental officials,
the Government Legal Department and counsel. The contents of this statement
are true to the best of my knowledge and belief. I am authorised by the Secretary

of State for Business and Trade to make it.

WITN11730200

3. This statement complements and should be read alongside my first witness

statement made to the Inquiry dated 2 October 2024 (WITN11730100).

HORIZON SHORTFALL SCHEME

4. I have set out detail on the Department's broader governance arrangements for
the Horizon Shortfall Scheme (“HSS”) below. The Panel assessment process is
managed by the Post Office and its legal advisors. DBT’s oversight consists of
the weekly case review. Further information on this is set out below and at

paragraphs 10 to 16.

Governance Arrangements

5. The Governance Arrangements for the HSS are set out in the Operations
Agreement (HSS Operations Agreement with Post Office (UKGI00017881))
between Post Office and the Department. As the Department is the shareholder
for Post Office Limited and is providing funding for the HSS, it has responsibility
for agreeing key decisions related to the scheme, relating to cost, fairness for

claimants, value for money, legal risk and funding.

The Department’s Horizon Shortfall Scheme Steering Committee

6. The HSS Steering Committee is the Department's decision-making body for HSS
matters. It sets the strategic direction for the Scheme, considers and provides
advice and assurance on relevant policy risks and issues, and reserves the right
to consider and approve Post Office’s approach to exceptional cases (as

described in paragraphs 10 to 16 below).

Page 2 of 25
WITN11730200
WITN11730200

7. The Steering Committee currently meets fortnightly. Meetings are chaired by
myself, as the project's Senior Responsible Owner (“SRO”). The Committee
consists of officials from the Department's Post Office policy, Finance and Legal
teams and HM Treasury. Previously UKGI attended in an observer capacity but
has progressively withdrawn from that role in 2022 and 2023 to focus on its wider

shareholder representative responsibilities.

Working Group

8. The Working Group supports the HSS Steering Committee with its functions. Its
primary responsibility is for identifying and working through risks, issues,
dependencies, and potential decisions that should be escalated to the
Committee. It provides scrutiny and challenge to any proposals put forward by
the Post Office and leads on engagement with the Post Office at an operational

level.

Monthly Monitoring Meetings and Quarterly Monitoring Meetings

9. The Department's ongoing oversight of the Scheme includes scrutiny of monthly
management information provided by the Post Office and monthly and quarterly
performance monitoring meetings with the Post Office. The Operations
Agreement (UKGI00017881) between the Department and the Post Office
provides that the quarterly monitoring meetings should also aim to consider and
provide an assessment of risks and issues affecting the scheme more broadly.
The quarterly meeting provides a more formal review point, with a wider cast list.
The monthly monitoring meeting provides me as the project’s SRO with the
opportunity to consider management information covering all applications to the
Scheme showing: the status of applications; an up-to-date cashflow forecast; an

Page 3 of 25
WITN11730200
WITN11730200

up-to-date cost estimate for the Scheme (including explanatory notes); any major
changes to the risks / issues assessment reported at the quarterly SRO meeting;
and information to monitor the Post Office's and the Department's responsibilities

under the Public Sector Equality Duty (“PSED”).

Case Review

10. The Department reviews cases that meet the ‘exceptional case criteria’ both prior

to and following the panel assessment.

11. The development of ‘exceptional case criteria’ is a key part of the quality
assurance, performance and risk management for the scheme. The criteria were
set to ensure that the Department has sight of a proportionate range of cases,
so it can satisfy itself that the assessment process is being carried out reasonably
and consistently across different claims. The criteria have been updated from
time to time to reflect novel cases or heads of loss that had not previously been
considered. The current exceptional case criteria are exhibited separately (Post
Office Limited Horizon Shortfall Scheme — Approach to review and approval of
claims v9.0 dated 22 January 2024 (BEIS0001188)). For reference, the full

names of the abbreviations used in this document are set out below:

(a) HMC: Horizon Matters Committee;

(b) RC: Remediation Committee;

(c) NCA: Notional Compensation Amount; and

(d) HOL: Heads of Loss.

Page 4 of 25
WITN11730200
WITN11730200

12. The Department's officials receive a summary of the case information and
recommendations made by the Post Office’s external legal advisors, Herbert
Smith Freehills (‘HSF”) and the independent panel. It also receives the

assessment carried out by the Horizon Matters Committee in the Post Office.

13. Departmental officials can raise any queries or concerns with the Post Office on

the cases that are escalated for approval.

14. The exceptional cases are shared with me _ to note the

recommendations/outcomes.

15. This approval is then provided in writing to the Post Office team ahead of an offer

letter being issued.

16. The number of cases referred to the Department varies week by week but my
team estimates that it is 5 cases on average each week, implying a total of 650
cases since March 2022. The Department estimates that it provides approval to

90% of cases within 5 working days.

Fixed sum offer

17. The Government announced on 13 March 2024 that it would introduce fixed sum

awards of £75,000 for eligible HSS claimants.

18. Following the announcement, Departmental officials engaged with the Post
Office on delivery, communications and funding issues to ensure that the
payments could be delivered effectively. For example, the uncertainty around the
costs due to a growing cohort made the detail of the funding agreement more

complex. Additionally, there were operational considerations to work through

Page 5 of 25
19.

20.

21.

WITN11730200
WITN11730200

because different groups of claimants were at different stages in the scheme and
had different characteristics (bankrupt, dissolved companies, those who had
received interim payments) that would require bespoke approaches. It was also
necessary to ensure that the communications were clear and transparent and

reflected the feedback that been provided to date.

These details were close to being finalised when the general election was called

by the then Prime Minister on 22 May 2024.

During the pre-election period from 25 May to the election on 4 July 2024, civil
servants had to apply discretion in carrying out any new activity due to the
propriety rules protecting political impartiality. Given the nature of the Fixed Sum
intervention, officials determined that new Ministers should be given the
opportunity to approve the approach before implementation. However, work

continued in the background on the funding, comms and delivery issues.

When the new Government was elected in July, officials had to test whether new
Ministers wanted to proceed with the HSS Fixed Sum awards. This work was a
priority for new Ministers in DBT and HMT, but they also needed to get up to
speed on the issue. Ministers received advice on proceeding with the Fixed Sum
on 22 July 2024 and gave approval on 30 July 2024 (Email from Secretary of
State's Private Secretary dated 30 July 2024 RE: Ministerial Submission -
Horizon Shortfall Scheme - Fixed Sum Awards - OFFICIAL SENSITIVE

(BEIS0000888)).

Page 6 of 25
WITN11730200
WITN11730200

22. Following approval from new Ministers, the Department's officials confirmed with
the Post Office in August 2024 that activity could commence on the Fixed Sum

awards and claimants could be contacted.

23. Post Office began issuing top-up offers in August 2024 so that those who had
previously settled below £75,000 would be offered the opportunity to be topped

up to this amount.

24. In September 2024, Post Office began contacting postmasters who had

outstanding claims in the HSS, to offer them the option of accepting the £75k.

25. Offers and payments are now being rolled out at pace. As of 10 October 2024,
235 Fixed Sum invitations have been issued. 150 claimants have applied and 72
have received offers, of which 56 have been accepted and 54 have been paid.
From the population in scope to receive a top-up to £75k, 1,771 invitation letters
have been sent. 1,307 responses have been received, with 1,188 accepts of

which 1,151 have been paid.

OVERTURNED CONVICTION PROCESS

Exceptional Cases referred to the Department

26. The following table sets out the details of how many cases have been referred to

DBT as an ‘exceptional case’ and the time period for DBT’s review of such cases:

Type of claim Number of exceptional cases Time taken for DBT
referred to DBT to review
First offer Second offer
Non-pecuniary 16 17 1-6 working days
Pecuniary 4 N/A 2-8 working days

Page 7 of 25

WITN11730200
WITN11730200

As the OC process developed, the Department and the Post Office agreed that
non-pecuniary and pecuniary claims could be processed separately in order to
speed up delivery of redress. Non-pecuniary claims were submitted more quickly
than pecuniary claims following Lord Dyson’s Early Neutral Evaluation in summer
2022. In October 2022, the Department decided to delegate approval rights for
non-exceptional non-pecuniary claims to the Post Office, according to a set of
exceptional case criteria (Overturned Convictions Operations Agreement with
Post Office (BEIS0000902)). Since that date, 16 non-pecuniary claims have
been submitted to the Department as they met the criteria to be categorised as
exceptional. 17 revised offers (where the claimant had rejected the initial offer)

were also submitted to the Department as exceptional.

The relevant governance board (Post Office Overturned Convictions Board or
“POC’”) met every Wednesday at the time. The Post Office and the Department
agreed that if a recommended offer was submitted to the Department by a
Wednesday one week, then the governance board would review and decide the
following Wednesday, so generally the Department's review period would be 1
week. In practice, claims were submitted on an ad hoc basis and the governance
board would try to review them as quickly as possible, including via
correspondence outside of the weekly meetings. The Department's review period
for the 33 cases mentioned (16 offers, 17 revised offers) ranged from 1 working
day to 6 working days. The Department provided feedback or approval to the
Post Office either on the same day that a decision was made or on the following

working day.

Page 8 of 25
WITN11730200
WITN11730200

29. Following agreement of pecuniary principles between the Post Office and
claimants’ legal representatives (and the Department's approval of them), the
Department decided to delegate non-exceptional pecuniary claims to the Post
Office in May 2024. Since then, 3 claims have been submitted as exceptional,
and 1 further claim has been partially submitted as exceptional (i.e. only certain
heads of loss). The Department's review period per claim has ranged from 2

working days to 8 working days.

Announcement of the fixed sum offer

30. At paragraph 47 of my first witness statement (WITN11730100), I said that the
Department began to consider making a fixed sum offer within the GLO scheme
in summer 2023, but no announcement was made until January 2024. During
the intervening period, the Department considered and analysed different policy
options to advance its objective of timely and successful delivery of full and fair

compensation for GLO claimants.

31. The policy required a full value for money assessment to be approved by the
Department’s Accounting Officer and by HM Treasury, having regard to
Government responsibility for public finances. The Department's Ministers
agreed in July 2023 that a fixed sum award was their preferred option to achieve

the Department's objective (BEIS0000888).

32. On 9 August 2023, the Secretary of State wrote to the Chancellor requesting that
we introduce a £100k fixed sum (Post Office Horizon Compensation Letter from

DBT (BEIS0000703)).

Page 9 of 25
WITN11730200
WITN11730200

33. On 4 September 2023, the Chancellor responded asking that the Department
explore a fuller breadth of options given the risk of repercussions on the cost of
other schemes to advance the ultimate objective of timely and successful
delivery of full and fair compensation (Letter from Jeremy Hunt to Kemi Badenoch
MP re Accelerating Post Office Horizon Compensation dated 4 September 2023

(BEIS0000707)).

34. On 2 November 2023, Minister Hollinrake wrote to the Chief Secretary to the
Treasury confirming the request to introduce a £100k fixed sum payment (Letter
from Kevin Hollinrake to John Glen MP re: Horizon Compensation

(BEIS0000727)).

35. In January 2024, the Chancellor and Prime Minister agreed the Department's
recommendation to introduce a fixed sum, at a lower level of £75k (Email from
HMT ‘RE: [12.00 Friday] Update on the Horizon IT scandal’ dated 10 January

2024) (BEIS0001189).

GROUP LITIGATION ORDER SCHEME

36. At paragraphs 122 and 123 of my first witness statement (WITN11730100), I
referred to what the Department calls a “full claim” being a claim that the
Department, with advice from its legal advisors, considers does not need any

further evidence for every element of the claim to be assessed.

37. For further context, such missing information sought from applicants on fully
assessed claims can include, but is not limited to: requests for underlying
documents referred to in the claim or Schedule of Loss that were not included in
the claim bundle; points of clarification where the claim is unclear or ambiguous

Page 10 of 25
38.

39.

40.

WITN11730200
WITN11730200

(such as conflicting "but for" scenarios or sequences of events); flagging of
assumptions and calculations in the forensic accountancy reports which are in
contradiction of the scheme’s Guidance and Principles that require the report to
be clarified; or flagging of lack of detail or comment in expert medical report on
key issues such as prognosis, severity of symptoms or recommended treatment

which require the report to be clarified.

It is highly unlikely that any information would be missing from a Fixed Sum claim
as the form only requires the GLO reference number, the previous settlement
amount received from the High Court ‘GLO’ case and details of any interim
payments received, as well as a date and signature. For that reason, missing

information has not been an issue for Fixed Sum claims to date.

If a claim is received where further information is needed only from POL, such a
claim will not be considered a ‘full claim’. A Request for Further Information to the
Post Office is treated in the same way for the purposes of the 40 working day
target and the claim is still considered incomplete. It may be possible for the Post
Office to respond within a few days to requests for simple clarification, in which
case the Department will endeavour to respond within the original 40 working
day period but this is unlikely to be the case where a shortfall analysis is required
to be undertaken by the Post Office, as these are resource intensive and the
resulting information can impact on the Department's assessment of multiple
heads of loss which need to be considered carefully by the Department on

receipt.

No information is required from the Post Office in respect of a Fixed Sum claim.

42. Since the establishment of the GLO Scheme, the average period of time between

the submission of an initial claim that is deemed not a ‘full claim’ and the

submission of a ‘full claim’ is (as at 30 August 2024):

(a) 18 days across all claims;

(b) 4 days for those that accepted a fixed sum; and

(c) 34 days for claims that are fully assessed.

43. Since its establishment, the average period of time between the submission of

an initial claim for full assessment and the resolution of the claim is (as at 30

August 2024:

(a) 45 days across all claims;

(b) 25 days for those that accepted a fixed sum; and

Page 13 of 25
WITN11730200
WITN11730200

(c) 95 days for claims that are fully assessed.

Expert Forensic Accounting Reports

44. Although funded by the Department, expert reports are commissioned and
received by claimants’ legal advisors. The Department has limited data from one
firm on the progress of such reports. However, this information is substantially
out of date, we have doubts about its accuracy in some respects and it does not
of course cover claimants represented by other firms. Furthermore, the
information was provided by the firm concerned on the basis that it would not be

further shared.

45. Since the establishment of the GLO Scheme, the average time between DBT
approving funding for a forensic accounting expert report and a full claim being

submitted by the Claimant is (as at 30 August 2024):

(a) 223 days across all claims;

(b) 172 days for those that accepted a fixed sum; and

(c) 232 days for claims that are fully assessed.

46. In relation to cases where funding for forensic accountancy evidence, medical
expert evidence or both have been approved:
(a) 135 full claims have been received;
(b) 80 claims have been settled; and
(c) 74 claims have been paid,

(as at 30th August).
Page 14 of 25
WITN11730200
WITN11730200

47. The standard levels of fees are set out in the published GLO Tariff of Reasonable
Legal Costs (POL report — Post Office Horizon Scandal: GLO Compensation
Scheme: Tariff of Reasonable Legal Costs (RLIT0000281)), which also sets out
the Department's process for agreeing requests for larger amounts. The

Department has approved fees above the tariff rate on 283 occasions.

48. Although funded by the Department, expert reports are commissioned and
received by claimants’ legal advisors. The Department does not therefore have
complete information on the response of forensic accountants to the tariff,
although it is aware that the two solicitors’ firms representing the majority of GLO

claimants have each contracted with a particular firm of forensic accountants.

PERFORMANCE TARGETS

51. Queries or concerns raised by the Post Office with respect to the redress
schemes may range from straightforward factual questions which can be
answered very quickly to much more complex ones which may, for instance,
require a decision by Ministers — within the Department or even collectively. No
performance target could accommodate such a broad range of queries, and

hence none has been set.

POST OFFICE EMPLOYEES WORKING ON REDRESS

52. Paragraph 11 of the report of the fourteenth meeting of the Horizon
Compensation Advisory Board (“Advisory Board”) held on 7 May 2024

(RLIT0000275), states:

‘The Board asked for reassurance from DBT that those who were working
on redress in the Post Office had not played a role in the Horizon scandal.
DBT confirmed they had asked the Post Office this question when setting

up the GLO scheme and they had received reassurance on this point. The

Page 18 of 25
53.

54.

55.

WITN11730200
WITN11730200

Board agreed that the Chair should write to the Post Office CEO to seek
assurances that other people who had played a role in the scandal were
not still involved in redress or appeals in any way.’

The Department was not in a position to provide the Advisory Board with
reassurances that those working on redress in the Post Office had not played a
role in the Horizon scandal, as the relevant information and decision-making
powers lay with the Post Office. However, the Department pressed the Post
Office to provide such assurances both on its own account and that of the

Advisory Board.

The Department has been informed by the Post Office that the only involvement

of Post Office staff in the GLO scheme was:

(a) in making disclosures (finding and redacting paper and electronic files); and

(b) in providing shortfall analyses (interpreting the large volumes of accounting
data provided to claimants’ lawyers to help them and the Department to

identify the cost to the postmaster of shortfalls).

The Post Office built a team, eventually comprising over 50 people, to deliver the
work. When conducting their internal recruitment for that team, the Director of
the Post Office's Remediation Unit, Simon Recaldin, noted orally to the
Department's staff that some of the individuals with the strongest relevant skills
and greatest familiarity with the Horizon system might, in previous roles, have
had some possible involvement in the scandal. He added that, because of the
greater training and familiarisation required, the disclosure process would take

longer without these individuals. The Department agreed with him that the people

Page 19 of 25
WITN11730200
WITN11730200

concerned would nonetheless be excluded from the process. The position of Post

Office staff involved in other aspects of redress was not discussed.

56. The letter from Simon Recaldin to Professor Christopher Hodges ‘re: Update on
rebuilding trust and redress’ dated 30 May 2024 (BEIS0000843) and email from
Simon Recaldin to Professor Christopher Hodges ‘RE: Horizon Claims -
personnel issues’ dated 19 July 2024 (BEIS0001187) provided the Advisory
Board with updates on the actions being taken by the Post Office to address the
concerns raised by the Board. Those updates made clear that work is still
ongoing. In conversation with Mr Recaldin, Departmental officials have

encouraged the Post Office to conclude this work.

57. However, at present, the Department is not satisfied that there are no people
working on redress who played a role in the Horizon scandal, given that the Post

Office has not yet provided such assurances.
