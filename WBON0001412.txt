Dear Sirs

POST OFFICE GROUP LITIGATION
HORIZON DISCLOSURE

We write further to your letter dated 17 January 2019.

Horizon Management Council

In your letter, you confirmed that you would conduct searches across the email accounts of Mr Rees,
Ms McGinn and Ms George as well as the SharePoint Site which Post Office’s Information Security
Team stored documents in for disclosure relating to Horizon Management Council.

Your client is obliged to provide these documents pursuant to Schedule 1 of the Fourth CMC Order
dated 5 June 2018. The delay is unacceptable and is prejudicing our client in their preparation for
the Horizon issues trial. Please therefore provide disclosure of these documents as soon as
possible.

Audit Reports

You also confirmed that disclosure of Audit Reports carried out by Ernst and Young for the years
2011 to 2018 have been disclosed. On 30 January 2019, you disclosed a further 102 documents
relating to audits carried out by Fujitsu. Please confirm that:

1. Fujitsu was the appointed auditor of Horizon prior to the instruction of Ernst and Young; and

2. All audit reports of Horizon (carried out both internally and externally) have now been
disclosed.
