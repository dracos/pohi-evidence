Thanks again.

The ‘cost’ is man time to create the scripting and run it — then compare the output. The POL charging model won’t
apply.

Is it technically possible? How would we do it? How much actual hands on effort do we think it will need?

I believe we have got to do this. So we need to decide how — and do it quickly.

Thanks Gerald,

I will remove the bullet point re FADs using specific DCs.

As for the p.s. I am afraid I am not sure what that means and how it affects what we are describing. If you are simply
enlightening me as to how it was configured — noting there were some differences to how other things were done —
then thank you. However, if you are saying that the way it was configured was wrong then that warrants more

checking.

! am saying that there is an option “Transfer Data” which automatically copies files gathered to the other audit server
FUJ00176510
FUJ00176510

each evening. It was a deliberate design policy. When they know that there were two copies of things anyway by
other mechanisms it was switched off.

Also, how can we pro-actively confirm no gaps in the combined audit archives for pre-HNG-X - instead of just waiting
for ARQ anomalies to pick up on something? Can we write a script/program to hunt for any possible issues?

The audit system is not designed for this. The actual files are stored on the Eternus zipped. The normal way of getting
them out is an ARQ which brings them back to the audit server, unzips them and checks for GAPS. 103 ARQs (a month
each for one FAD) costs £17,913.76 . By the normal process you would be talking tens of millions of pounds.

Hi Steve,
Apologies for the delay in replying. Too much going on including one of our cars in the garage!

. By design, some FADs used Bootle as their primary data centre, and others used Wigan. Some used both

This is not right,
My understanding is that Wigan and Bootle are equal.
There were separate harvesters on each.

Any transaction is saved both in a Wigan file and a Bootle file. Both audit servers were active. The Wigan audit
server saved the Wigan file and the Bootle audit server saved the Bootle file.

Regards,
Gerald Barnes

p.s. Both audit servers by a configuration change could in principal have copied each file one to other but my guess is
that the designers thought that you would end up with 4 copies of each transaction which was overkill. From the
notes in DEV/INF/ION/0001 it looks like most other files other than these transaction files were copied one to other. I
attach an earlier copy of DEV/INF/ION/0001. You will see most of the time in the table at the end “Transfer Data” is
“YES” apart from the below

Hi All,

Please see updated statement below.
* Accepted the changes that Phil added directly
© Orange updates based on comments below from Phil/Gerald.

Steve/Gerald/Phil — please confirm if happy with the below. I’m guessing there may be some further tweaks needed
so will setup a short call for tomorrow am so we can finalise - I can cancel if not needed!

Problem Summary:

Post Office counter audit transaction files gathered prior to the HNGx software rewrite in 2010 are not
consistent across both IRE11 & IRE19 servers. Holistically no data is missing but in rare instances transaction
data exists only on one server or the other. The problem was caused by the occasional malfunction of the
Harvester process of the previous Horizon system - Riposte.

Background:

Audit Gathering Method in Horizon up to approx 2010

* Originally a system called Riposte was used, as part of Horizon, to gather audit transactions from all the Post
Office counters.

© Riposte was a big distributed database.

* At that time Riposte was deployed into Bootle & Wigan data centres.

* Each evening all Post Office counter transactions were harvested and stored in files.

° By design transactions were either harvested to Wigan or Bootle or both data centres.

* Different files were produced in each data centre. The files were different because although the same
transactions were harvested they were processed in a different order and for different FADs. Filenames were
also different.

* The “CopyData” option (robocopy) was not set for transaction files which were gathered to both data centres.
¢ It is now known that due to the occasional malfunction of the Harvester process, for those transactions
harvested to both datacentres, data may be missing from the files gathered in one or other data centre.

e There is no recorded instance of both harvesters failing at the same time so although data may be
missing from one server it will be present in the other.

e® NOTE: The data gathered using this method, in accordance with the contract, should have been deleted
by now. It is only being retained currently, beyond Fujitsu Services’ contracted obligations, at Post Office’s
request (below text from CWO0395b)
Post Office have requested under RTQSRO003106 (previously RTQSRO002349 and RTQSRO002456) that
Fujitsu Services continue to preserve data (including Post Office Personal Data) generated on the HNG-X
System as per the previous work orders (CT2616a & CW0251a) until 30 April 2022.

Audit Gathering Method for HNG-X from 2010 onwards
e Around 2010 the contract came up for renewal.
e  Fujitsu’s proposal was a rewrite called HNGx which eliminated Riposte (for which there was a big annual
licence fee) and to migrate the datacentres from Wigan and Bootle to IRE11 and IRE19.
e As apart of this rewrite each Post Office counter transaction was only processed into a one file ona
single server.
e — This drove the decision to change the Audit gathering approach.

FUJ00176510
FUJ00176510

¢ From this point forward all transaction and non-transaction files were gathered by the IRE11 Audit Server
only and robocopied to the IRE19 Audit Server.

e Therefore from 2010 all audit files (transaction and non-transaction) are consistent across both audit
servers.

Impact on ARQ requests
@ When ARQ requests for a FAD code are made all relevant files are retrieved from the target audit server .
«Then the files are processed by the Query Manager service on the audit server.
e¢ — Each Horizon or HNGx transaction has a unique number associated with it. The Query Manager checks
that the transactions
= have not been tampered with
= that there are no duplicates or gaps in the sequence of transactions.
* Due to the Riposte harvester issue, for ARQ queries from 2010 or earlier, there may be gaps in the results
from one or other of the servers.
« — If this occurs then a Peak is raised and the ARQ request is rerun on the other server. This resolves any
issues with data gaps.
« There have been no reported instances of unsuccessful ARQ request once a query has been executed on
the second server.

Hi Paul

I think these two buttllet-points (in the pre-2010 section) are liable to cause confusion/consternation ...
e The Bootle audit server gathered Bootle transaction files and the Wigan audit server gathered Wigan
transactions files.
e Although there was an option to robocopy files from one server it was switched off because there were
already two copies of each transaction (one in each data centre).
.. as I understand it (from Gerald's explanation (and I may have mis-understood)), by design transactions were either
harvested to Wigan or Bootle or BOTH ... and the robocopy was ONLY turned off for those transactions configured to
FUJ00176510
FUJ00176510

be copied to both datacentres I think it’s important that we show that this was not designed to leave single copies of
data anywhere. Please correct me if I’m wrong there Gerald.

My understanding (from reading historic copies of DEV/INF/ION/0001 and from practical experience) is that the main
case of the “CopyData” option (the robocopy) not being set was these transaction files. The logic behind that I guess (I
was not the designer) is that two copies of each transaction were made anyway — one on Bootle and one Wigan. If we
need more detail on this I will need to get out from Dimensions historic copies of the configuration file to examine.

if I'm not wrong, then this statement “due to the occasional malfunction of the Harvester process in one or other of the
data centres transactions may be missing from the files gathered in that data centre” needs to be clarified that that’s
only true for those transactions configured to be harvested to BOTH datacentres.

That is right. Pretty certain that was all Horizon (pre 2010) transaction data.

lve also proposed some changes to the text inline below (in this colour), trying to make it more clear that this was a
change instigated by the Horizon to HNG-X change.

I think we also need to consider how we should include the details that the data in question is only being retained

currently, beyond Fujitsu Services’ contracted obligations, at Post Office’s request (below text from CWO0395b) ..
Post Office have requested under RTQSRO003106 (previously RTQSRO002349 and RTQSRO002456) that Fujitsu
Services continue to preserve data (including Post Office Personal Data) generated on the HNG-X System as
per the previous work orders (CT2616a & CW0251a) until 30 April 2022.

... and (in accordance to our contract) should have been deleted, by now.

Yes that is right — normally the files would have been deleted long ago!

Hi Steve

I am Migration Lead for the Audit Migration to AWS.

Myself and Gerald Barnes (Audit SME) are currently working with POL to define requirements for the migration of
historical Audit data

An historical issue has been identified and is detailed below.

This issue was discussed yesterday with John Nelis the POL PM & also Dean Bessell who I understand is your POL
opposite.

POL requested that we write up what was communicated in the meeting so they can take it to their legal team ahead
of making a decision regarding the scope of the data to be migrated.

On that basis I don’t wish to send anything over without it being reviewed and agreed by relevant parties. Happy to
have a call to discuss further.

communicated to POL?
