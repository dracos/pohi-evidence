3.11.8

The Training Support Facility supports training from CTOs enabling each CTO
Counter within a CTO to operate an independent training environment.

The Training Support Facility utilises those aspects of the Business Capabilities
and Support Facilities that provide Branch based capability together with
separate functionality to simulate online interfaces which will return pre-defined
simulation responses. For transactions that would be performed using Payment
and Banking Service in Branches, an emulator is provided to emulate interactions
with the Payment and Banking System. The emulator implements a fixed set of
responses as described in the document entitled “CTO C3 Emulator User Guide”,
(DES/GEN/MAN/4318).

Users of the Training Support Facility will generate Training Transactions and
Training Data that will be separated and separately identifiable from HNG-X
Transactions and data. Training Data will not be passed to external clients or the
audit stream.

Reports generated using the Training Support Facility will reflect the Training
Transactions performed during the Training Session and stock levels reported will
be adjusted accordingly.

Post Office will establish and manage each CTO Branch as a Branch within the
live estate and each will be allocated their own Branch Code which will indicate
that they are a CTO Branch.

The Training Support Facility will utilise Replaced Branch Infrastructure and will
require the use of an operational data communications link in order to process
Training Transactions. Each CTO Counter within a CTO will be connected by
LAN through the shared single branch router, and there will be a shared back
office printer.

The Training Support Facility will enable the Training Data of a CTO Counter to
be reset back to a pre-defined default state.

The Training Support Facility will require the use of an operational data
communications link in order that updates of software change and reference data
can occur. This may take place automatically in the same manner as for Branches
or at points in time that are agreed between Fujitsu Services and Post Office.
