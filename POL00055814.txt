Dear Sirs

R -v- ALISON HENDERSON
NORWICH CROWN COURT — WARNED LIST — FOR TRIAL - 29 NOVEMBER 2010

Further to my letter of 17 November 2010. The Investigation Manager has
considered the Defence Statement and is of a view that there is no material that
needs to be disclosed as a result of the contents of that statement. However, you
refer in the Defence Statement at Paragraph 2, to further investigations which could
have discovered the whereabouts of the alleged missing sum. Could you explain
what you mean by this statement.

Yours faithfully

Rob G Wilson
Head of Criminal Law
Criminal Law Division
