Royal Mail Holdings plc

Chairman's Statement

‘Year one of our Renewal Plan has been a year of progress. A year where we have started to contro! our costs, reduce overheads and take the
first real steps towards creating a sustainable and thriving company,

At the end of year one of our three-year Renewal Pian, the Group has made a £611m pre-tax loss and a £197m loss from operations. This is an
improvement of £121m or 38% over our losses from operations in 2001-02,

Our people have worked hard to achieve this progress and it is to their credit that we can look to the future more positively today. We have a great
deal more to do and some significant risks to deal with before we can demonstrate that we have transformed our business into a profitable,
moder and competitive company.

‘A’Share in Success’ scheme was launched earlier this year, which will pay a dividend to all our eligible people if we hit the profit targets in the
third year of the Renewal Plan. I am pleased that this year’s results show that we are on target to reward our people for their hard work in turning
this business around.

‘We have appointed an experienced leadership team with Elmar Toime, the new Executive Deputy Chairman, Adam Crozier, Chief Executive of
Royal Mail Group plc, and David Mills, Chief Executive of Post Office Limited, together with six external appointments to the Board.

Customer service has improved throughout the year with an overall cumulative increase in our quality of service for First Class letters, however,
we missed hitting a number of our year end targets. Parcelforce Worldwide exceeded its target of 96% for PF 24 hour delivery, achieving 98%,
and Post Office Limited made great strides in improving queuing times over last year to exit at 94.3%. Improved colleague relations, leading to
fewer strikes with strike days down 90% year on year, have played an important part in getting this right, but we stil have further to go to achieve
our service targets across all our key products.

Our goals forthe organisation remain clear:
- Make our business a great place to work
- Improve customer service
-Retum to profitability
- Deliver positive cash flow

In order to achieve these goals we must deliver the critical strands of our Renewal Plan, which fundamentally restructures our operations in order
to make the Royal Mail Group a profitable and sustainable business.

Parcelforce Worldwide has led the way through working in partnership with its people to eliminate unprofitable products and inefficient aspects of
its operations. Progress has not been as rapid in the UK maits operations as we work through @ numberof issues, including taking stock of the
regulatory environment.

The radical surgery I talked about last year means we have cut management and administrative overheads right across the business. Overall
some 16,500 jobs have gone with around 5,500 people taking voluntary redundancy and 4,600 people not being replaced as they leave. Some
6,500 jobs have transferred to new companies under TUPE arrangements.

We have now secured a manageable package of price controls in consultation with Postcomm, our Regulator. These controls allow us to add 1p
to the cost of First and Second Class stamps - the first increase in First Class postage for three years. We sfill offer one of the lowest price yet
highest delivery specifications in Europe.

‘What we now need to resolve is a fair and reasonable price for competitors’ access to our delivery network. At present the Regulator’s proposals.
‘on competition and the price set for access to our network, which we believe are again out of step with the EU Postal Directive, could strip out
£tbn of revenue from Royal Mail over the forthcoming years and force the Company to sort and deliver letters for a prioe well below economic
costs. Itis vital that we charge a commercial price for our services if we are to protect a universal price and service for all customers.

A commercial loan package worth £1,044m has been agreed with Government. Securing this finance deal means we can concentrate on
delivering the savings identified in our Renewal Plan to take the Company back into profitability.

In addition, the Government has agreed financing support, using our €1.8bn investments for the Post Office network. This includes a £450m
three-year package of support fo ensure the continuation of uneconomic services via Post Offices in the rural communities.

‘The new pensions accounting standard (FRS 17) means we are reporting in the notes to the accounts a hypothetical deficit of £4.6bn on Royal
Mait’s pension fund, which had assets at the end of last year of £15.6bn. This accounting approach depends on the state of the stock market on
the day that the assets of the fund are valued, and the FRS 17 deficit reflects the low market conditions at the end of our financial year. The deficit
does not represent the Pension Plan valuation by an independent actuary, and a separate review of this on behalf of the Trustees is being carried
out as at 31 March 2003, We anficipate that we will no longer benefit from a pension surplus as we have for the past 13 years and we are likely to
make additional payments to the fund of some £100m per annum until the deficit is cleared, subject to agreement with the Trustees of an
approved funding plan, to ensure our people's existing contributions are safe.

Chairman's Statement (continued)

Although the pension provision is an additional cost, improvements in customer service, fewer strikes and a reat focus on making this a better
place to work will put us back on track. We are stil some way off reporting a profit but this year's results are a real step in the right direction.
The enormous goodwill we have in our people, our brands and our customers means we are within sight of regaining our profitability and our

aon as the best postal service in the world.

Joint Deputy Chairman’s and Chief Executives’ Statement

In the last year the business has managed to reduce its ongoing fosses through measures that have contained costs and reduced overheads. But
there is slippage on some of the key programmes in the Renewal Plan and this is where we must focus in the coming year.

Lord Sawyer's second review of industrial relations, published in March 2008, praised Royel Mail and the unions for their ongoing effort to stop
industrial action and iraprove relations. Since the launch of 17 local partnership boards, industrial action is at a ten-year low. Out of some 55
milion available working days for our people in the UK, 6,686 (0.01%) were lost to strike action in the last year.

There was nearly @ 2% cumulative rise in quality of service for First Clas letters, and customer confidence is building. We achieved good results
for Parcelforce Worldwide (98%), and Post Office Limited was up on last year, but we stil missed our target for First Class quality of service and
overall, only achieved 3 out of 15 year end headline service standards for mail, There is obviousty still room for improvement and our quality of
service plan is geared to achieve that in the coming year.

The timed, next day guaranteed delivery product, Special Delivery, has continued to outperform competitive offerings in terms of value-for-money
and is responsible for £239m (an underlying growth of 10% on previous year} or around 4% of revenue for Royal Mail.

We wanted fo move nationally toa single daily delivery early in 2003. Although we failed to meet that target, the common sense rationale is stil
compelling - as second deliveries account for 20% of costs but only 4% of volume, itis nota viable proposition. The 13 rial areas told us what
worked and what didn't, and we've made changes to the plan accordingly. Customer reactions to the changes and their wilingness to be flexible
in order to protect the Universal Service Obligation in the long-term are encouraging.

Despite some frustratingly stow progress, we are now pushing ahead, with real buy-in from our people. We are expecting to implement a union
agreement, which offers our people an increase in basic pay, a five-day working week and simplified bonus schemes based on the achievement
of agreed weekly targets.

98 offices have started planning for these changes and a futher roll-out will happen over the next year - but because of slippage inthe first year,
the pressure ison to deliver the predicted programme benefits

We've modemised key stages of the UK’s mail sortation, and not before time. To support improved and more efficient delivery systems, we are
introducing address interpretation electronic systems capable of reading poorly addressed mail, which will drive up quality by reducing sorting
errors. 63 out of 70 mail centres are connected and more than half of our automated mail passes through these systems currently.

‘We have also embarked on the wholesale rationalisation of our transport network. We are implementing plans to move standard tariff and bulk
mail around more efficiently by creating a single, integrated network based on a regional hub-and-spoke’ system. The number of distribution
centres has reduced to 13 from 16 and the successful absorption of work from Thames Valley distribution centre to Bristol proves the approach is
viable and delivers. in addition, a £40m hub at Daventry is expected to be finished in August 2003,

Our logistics business continues to offer a warehousing capablity to customers and relum logistics contracts such as those with Amazon.com
and Retum Logistics Limited (supplying Virgin, Waterstones and Safeway), support the growth in sales through the internet, mail order and home
shopping.

Parcelforce Worldwide has successfully undergone the most radical surgery across the Group in line with plans announced in March 2002. After
‘some ten years of losses, the business is on target to break even in 2004-05. The number of depots has been cut from 101 to 54, routes have
been completely reworked and new ways of combined working and a new system of owner-drivers have been introduced successfully.
Significantly for customers, Parcelforce Worldwide has identified and focused on the successful business of ‘time-guaranteed’, ‘next day’ and ‘two
day’ express deliveries, exiting loss-making non-guaranteed services and 350 unprofitable contracts.

Our European parcels business, General Logistics Systems (GLS), has continued to grow its volumes and revenues. As a result of the economic
downtum across Europe, the rate of growth has been slower than expected. Consequently GLS has tightened further its control on operating
expenses and, coupled with margin improvement, has increased its operating earnings before interest and tax. The focus is on continued
integration of the individual parcel companies - building upon the recent re-branding exercise, which brought the companies under a common
brand, and the cross-border IT project, which increases the information available to customers and the efficiency of the cross-border product
stream,

An unprecedented restructuring and modemisation programme is underway for our Post Office network. As outlined in our network plan, agreed
with Government last autumn, new products and funding packages are now in place and the rate of unplanned closures has slowed from 262 in
2001-02 to 239 this year.

However, the Post Office network continues to make a loss and comprehensive reinvention is needed to manage a rapidly changing environment.

In March 2003, we launched the Post Office card account. This card is used to access benefits payments and we can now undertake basic bank
account transactions for the major banks together with current account transactions for selected institutions. The introduction of new and
enhanced services such as currency exchange, travel insurance and access to funds through the high street banks’ basic bank accounts alt
ensure that the network remains relevant to the business of everyday life.

Parliamentary and EU approval for a funding package of £210m to support the urban network has enabled our Network Reinvention programme
to push ahead. This involves the planned closure of some 3,000 urban Post Offices over the next three years and incorporates compensation
payments to subpostmasters. In a preference exercise 3,700 subpostmasters expressed an interest in this scheme. The package also includes
£30m for investment in branches that want to expand or improve.

Joint Deputy Chairman’s and Chief Executives’ Statement (continued)

We are determined to keep a Post Office branch in urban areas within a mile of 95% of our customers. ‘Urban deprived’ branches (totalling 2,800
in England) will also be able to apply for an improvement grant from a £15m fund, which forms part of the Government's plan to regenerate
impoverished communities. In November 2002, Post Office branches in Wales received a total fund of £2.5m and the Scottish Executive
announced a £2m fund for branches in deprived areas in December 2002.

The Government's £450m funding package over three years will help continue aocess to over-the-counter services in rural areas and prevent
avoidable closures.

One of the key activities over the year has been our absolute focus on our core businesses. We have successfully outsourced some 5,000 jobs
from our faclties management services, saving some £30m per annum over the seven-year contract, and a further 200 employee health services
jobs and switched 1,300 jobs to Capita, who now collect TV licence fees, Our 1,7364strong Business Systems uni will be outsourced from early
June as part of an agreed deal that will deliver savings of some £60m per annum over the ten-year life ofthe contract.

We have simplified our UK organisational structure - stripping out layers of management and administrative roles. Our aim is to reduce these jobs
by 25% and we are well on our way towards that goal

‘We also changed the corporate name to Royal Mail in order to focus on our key UK brands: Royal Mail, Parcelforce Worldwide and Post Office™.

There is a great deal to do in year two of our Renewal Plan and it will be even more challenging than the year we've just seen. We now have the
leadership team in place to drive change through the business and the Renewal Plan is just the beginning. Our foe On range prota and
sustainable business for the future means we will deliver for our customers fe ‘our people.

Royal Mail Holdings plc

Financial Review

The Royal Mail Group (the Group) comprises Royal Mail Holdings plc (the Company) - which is wholly-owned by HM Government - and its
subsidiary and associated undertakings and joint ventures. The Company is incorporated under the Companies Act {the Act), and the accounts
are produced in accordance with this Act and applicable UK aooounting standards.

‘On 4 November 2002, the Company changed its name from Consignia Holdings pic to Royal Mail Holdings plc.
The accounts are drawn up for the 52-week period ended on 30 March 2003 (2002 53 weeks).

Going concern

‘Since the uncertainty over going concern reported in last year’s accounts, considerable progress has been made in our financing discussions with
Government. We have now concluded a £1,044m commercial loan facility, which is designed to enable Royal Mail to fund itself through to cash
flow self-sufficiency. The Directors are, therefore, now satisfied that Royal Mail will continue as a going concern,

We have agreed with Government that the total operational financing needs of Post Office Limited of £0.7bn over the next five years will be
provided out of the Group's existing current asset investments that have been set aside to back the Mails Reserve. In addition, a further £1.2bn
Joan facitity to fund the working capital needs of the Post Office network has been agreed in principle with Government, with the detailed terms
close to completion.

‘As such, the Directors consider it appropriate to prepare the Group statements on a going concem basis.

Group results

“The Group's full year loss from its operations of £197m (2002 £318m) before exceptional items - equivalent to £0.8m every trading day -is a
significant improvement on last year's £1.2m loss per trading day. The difference between the Group operating profit/(loss) and the loss from
operations, both before exceptional items, is explained below:

2003 2002

Group operating profitloss) before exceptional items 19 7)
‘Add back pensions benefit derived in accordance with SSAP 24 (248) (250)
(227) (17)

Share of profitloss) in associates and joint ventures (including non-exceptional impairment of goodwill 30 (1)
Loss from operations (197) (318)

‘The £227m loss, analysed by business segments on page 33 of the accounts, is attributed to @ mails and parcels profit of 12m, Past Office
services loss of £209m and other businesses losses of £30m.

The loss before taxation was £611m (2002 £1,124m). This loss reflects net interest receivable of £35m (2002 £56m) and exceptional items of
£695m (2002 £1,112m). The loss for the year of £559m (2002 £940m) was after a net tax credit of £52m (2002 £179m) and a small amount of
equity minority interest.

External tumover at £8,209m (excluding £79m tumover from joint ventures) was £104m lower than last year. 2001-02 was, however, a 53-week
‘accounting period against §2 in the curent year. After adjusting ast year's tumover to a 62-wek basis, the 2002-03 tumover represents an
increase of £50m (0.6%), driven by growth in the mails and paroels segment (£140m) offset by dectines in Post Office Limited (36m) and other
businesses (£54m).

‘The Group net assets at the 30 March 2003 stood at £2,088m, a reduction of £517m from the closing position last year. The principal movement
arose from the sale of current asset investments of £550m to sustain the Post Office network, to fund the Renewal Programme and to make the
pension prepayment. As with last year, the Group's cash position was helped by the pension holiday of £126m (2002 £ 36m). The holiday relates
to the surplus built up in the pension scheme over the past 20 years because of the high equity bias of the fund during a sustained period of bull
market retums.

The segmental analysis in note 1 to the Group accounts analyses the operating loss in accordance with SSAP 25 - Segmental Reporting. We
have set out below an altemative analysis that recognises the pensions benefit does not arise from current trading and to reflect the substantial
amount of trading between operational units and other support functions (intemal trading). The analysis below also takes into account the impact
of internal interest charged to businesses for their use of centrally managed funding resources. Cash flows include both movements in physical
cash and working capital movements funded through intercompany balances.

Mails and parcels

Mails and parcels consist of our traditional businesses of UK and international mails {including overseas mails businesses set up or acquired),
Parcefforce, Logistics Solutions and our European parcels businesses - GLS. Together, these businesses reported total extemal revenue of
£7,351m, an increase of £m over 2002, and losses from operations of £120m (2002 £241m).

Financial Review (continued)

UK mails

UK mails' external revenue increased by £256m to £5,548m. The increase was attributable to a switch of £269m income from Parcelforce for the
‘Special Detivery product, the Universal Service Obligation parcels and Mail Order retums, offset principally by loss of revenue due to the 53rd
week, to give an underlying growth of £56m in core letter products - represented by a 1.1% growh in pillar box and collection postings and a
41.2% growth in commercial and bulk-posted letters. These low levels of growth continue to reflect a slowdown in the national economy that has
particularly impacted the advertising and publishing markets.

Total costs including net internal trading grew by £116m to £5,482m. The cost of inflation, the annual pay award and one-off costs of mails
automation programmes were largely offset by efficiency improvements and a robust management of all discretionary spend.

Overall, the maifs business turned a loss from operations last year, before exceptional items, of £74m to a profit of £66m, This result includes new
profits for the UK mails division from the transferred products amounting to some £75m. Losses after exceptional items but before tax were
£269m and the cash inflow was £74m.

International mails

International mails’ extemal income fell by 9% to £687m. This decline was partly the effect of the 53rd week (£14m) but largely due to
‘management action to exit from loss-making product areas and the impact of electronic substitution. Tota! external costs at £343m reduced by
£74m - an 18% saving over the prior year. These savings were due to the exit from loss-making products and lower handling costs both in the UK
and overseas. The net effect of these operational changes were offset by higher internal trading costs, resulting in an unchanged loss at £18m
before exceptional items and tax, and a loss of £44m after exceptional items but before tax. The cash outflow from the international mails
operations was £45m, driven by a combination of losses and the timing of settlements with other postal administrations.

Parcelforce

In March 2002, the Board announced a far-reaching tumaround plan for its UK parcels business. This involved the closure of the operational
network that provided the Standard product (/.e. non ‘time-guaranteed’, non ‘next day’ or ‘two day’ express deliveries) and a full withdrawal from
the product (and its declining market), the introduction of more owner-drivers to the collection and delivery fleet, and the termination of some 350
large customer contracts that were judged to provide inadequate yield. Accountability for the Special Delivery product, the Universal Service
Obligation parcels and Mail Order retums was also switched to UK mails. The actions taken so far have included the closure of five sort centres,
the reduction of some 50% of operational jobs, the closure of 50 depots and the reduction of average daily traffic volumes from some 400,000 to I
170,000. The consequence of this was a reduction in UK parcels’ external income by £178m to £296m (a 38% decline). At the same time, the
restructuring of its network caused operating costs to fall by £85m fo £483m (a decline of 15%). Overall, the losses from operations increased
from £94m to £187m. This reflected the immediate impact of the income withdrawal versus the slower pace to drive down the cost base as we
worked through the network closure programme, which is fundamentally complete. The business cash outflow was £211m.

Logistics Solutions
Logistics Solutions manages a network of warehouses and 1,900 vehicles to provide a distribution service for both extemal customers and other
internal operating businesses.

AAs a consequence of the restructuring of Parcelforce, the transfer of accountabity for high volume parcels customers, previously with Logistics
Solutions, moved back to Parcelforce, As a result, Logistics Solutions’ extemal income fel by £194m to £34m. The repositioning of the high
volume parcels customers had the effect of increasing Logistics Solutions’ intemal trading receipts by £207m to £332m. The external operating
costs for the overall service fell by £15m to £353m due to a number of local eficiency measures. The net impact was to tum last years overall
loss before exceptional costs of £15m to a profit of 13m. Exceptional costs were £46m, bringing total losses before tax to £33m. Cash inflow for
the business was £42m,

General Logistics Systems

GLS, our European parcels operation, grew its external income by £186m to £786m during the year. This increase was driven by a combination
of the full year effects of acquisitions (£90m), currency translations (£71m) and underlying growth £25m (4%). Profit before interest and tax was
£14m, a significant improvement on last year’s £14m loss, The earings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation was £39m, an €18m
improvement over the previous year.

Post Office Limited

Post Office Limited is responsible for 17,239 retail outlets of which 18,521 are independently owned. This year saw the delivery of many key
milestones designed to stem the network's high levels of losses, The Horizon contract was re-negotiated and wil result in considerable savings;
36,000 people were trained to deliver the banking transactions; a sales and marketing function was set up; 12 financial institutions signed up for
banking access with the system going ive at all outlets on schedule; 13 cash centres and depots were closed and all funding was agreed with
Government.

Total income decreased by £104m (8%) to £1,186m, of which intemal income from servicing the mails and parcels businesses accounted for
£50 ofthis decline. External income was £899m, a dectine of £54m (6%). Ths is a combination of a small growth in our underlying business of
£20m that was more than offset by @ reduced contribution from Government for developing banking capabilties and piloting the Your Guide
initiative. Overall costs, including internal trading costs from other parts of the Group, reduced by £73m (5%) to £1,380m.

Losses before exceptional items amounted to £194m -£31m (19%) higher than last year - which includes a net investment of about £50m in the
banking programme, The loss after exceptional ters was £363m and the cash outflow for the year was £286,

Royal Mail Holdings plc

Financial Review (continued)

The universal banking system has now gone live with the first Post Office card accounts and Basic Bank accounts being opened - itis too early to
say what the level of take-up of either product will be, This service will allow people receiving benefits, currently over 15 million people, to make
cash withdrawals at Post Offices.

The difficult financial position of Post Office Limited (including the replacement of the substantial Department for Work and Pensions revenue
stream) continues to be addressed in three ways, Firstly, we are rationalising the urban network, secondly, we are implementing our strategic
review, which is addressing the economic viability, social obligations and the commercial opportunities of the network, and thirdly, we are
reducing our overhead costs.

Other Group activities

Other Group activities comprise the treasury management of cash and market investments, the Group Centre and other support services to the
main trading businesses. Profit from operations forthe year, prior to the pensions benefit was £117m, £31m better than last year. The profit
mainly consists of internal interest charges made to operating and support units of £176m {2002 £214m), offset by lower net losses on support
services’ activities of £59m (2002 £126m), mainly arising from lower estate management costs and development spend.

Exceptional items
The Group results include net exceptional costs of £695m (2002 £1,142m), all of which resulted from a series of initiatives announced in the
Renewal Programme to remove £1.4bn from our annual gross cost base.

Provisions of £449m were made in the year for redundancy, covering the changes in sorting and delivery of mail of £230m, the review of the Post
Office Limited structure of £73m and the restructuring of distribution transport operations of £22m, The provisions relate to our people working
directly in the businesses implementing change. in addition, provisions of £124m were made covering our people working in support functions
and minor restructuring projects. The provisions above are inclusive of the necessary top-up to the Royal Mail Pension Plan of £200m,

Impairment write-downs of £97m and non-redundancy-related provisions of £151m were made, of which £25m relates to costs associated with
changes to our transport network, and £126m in respect of vacant property costs and other costs associated with the Renewals Programme.

We have impaired our investment in associates by £24m, principally Spring £19m, reflecting our view of economic prospects within the relevant
markets.

The accounts also include net profits on disposal of fixed assets of £24m (2002 £24m) and £2m profit on sale of part of one of our subsidiary
undertakings, Romec Limited, to our joint venture partner, Haden Building Management Limited.

Taxation
The accounts include a £4m current tax credit (2002 a charge of £3m) and a deferred tax credit of £48m {2002 £182m) for the year.

The tax credit for 2003 represents an effective tax rate of 9% on a loss before tax, compared to a 16% credit for 2002, The credit mainly arises
from relief on restructuring costs, which gives rise to losses that have in part been offset against deferred tax liabiliies and surrendered to
associates and joint ventures.

Treasury

The Group operates a central treasury function that manages some £1,251m of investments and £550m of borrowings in accordance with
investment restrictions set by Government, and acts as internal banker for the Group. The Group finances its operations largely through retained
profits and borrowings.

Group Treasury derives its authority from the Royal Mail Hollings plc Board and provides regular monitoring reports for their review. The treasury
function only has the authority to undertake financial transactions relating to the management of underlying business risks, All strategies are risk
averse and the treasury policy has remained unchanged during the period.

During the third quarter of this financial year, the Group entered into financing arrangements with the DTI to secure a package for the restructuring
of the Mails Business, The Royal Mail Credit Agreement provides for a maximum facility of £1,044m, made up of fixed and floating tranches
repayable between March 2007 (£200m) and March 2009 (£844m).

‘A framework agreement has been signed between Post Office Limited, Royal Mail and the Secretary of State dealing with Mails' past surpluses
and funding for the Mails Business restructuring. Under the framework agreement Royal Mail will provide funding to Post Office Limited out of
certain accumulated reserves. Finance in the form of loans from the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry is to be provided for cash and near
cash items in the Post Office Limited network, in transit and in cash centres, including peak funding requirements to a maximum of £1,200m. This
finance is intended to replace the pre-funding provided by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) for benefit payments prior to the
introduction of Automatic Credit Transfer (ACT) for claimant payments, Although details have yet to be agreed, it is thought that the finance will be
made up of a core facility of bonds together with a flexible loan facility.

The Group's main financial risks are interest rate and foreign currency tisk. The Group mitigates interest rate risk through a portfolio approach to
investment. Short-term portfolios are driven by liquidity requirements and medium-term portfolios driven by investment decisions. The Group's
principal sterling financial instruments are deposits, gilts and short and long-term borrowings.

Financial Review (continued)

Foreign currency balances held to operate the Bureau de Change service are hedged by Group Treasury using a combination of forward and spot
contracts. Where possible, internal netting of exposures takes place.

‘The Group is exposed to transaction risk from its obligation to pay overseas postal administrations for the delivery of UK-originating mail. This
exposure is. denominated it in Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) - a basket currency of US Dollars, euros, Japanese Yen and Sterling. This risk is
minimised by using forward foreign currency contracts, options and foreign cusrency deposits. The Group has a policy of matching receipts and
payments for it iual currencies. A maximum of 80% of the exposure to pay overseas administrations is hedged. This programme utilises
forward contracts, options, and foreign currency deposits. Treasury operate a rolling 18-month programme, which is subsequently reviewed on a
quarterly basis.

All other significant current liabilities are hedged when they become contractual.
The Group is exposed to foreign currency translation risk on the net assets of all overseas subsidiaries.

‘The Group's fuel risk management strategy aims to reduce uncertainty created by movements in the oil market. The strategy operates within the
parameters set by the Board. The fuel procurement programme allows for the use of over-the-counter derivative products to manage both the
‘commodity and foreign exchange elements of the exposure.

Counterparty risk is managed by limiting aggregate exposure fo any individual counterparty. These exposures are reviewed regularly and
adjusted as appropriate.

Debt
Consolidated debt at 30 March 2003 was £637m, a year-on-year reduction of £68m, principally reflecting the easly repayment of a loan.

Interest receivable
The Group's net interest receivable was £35m. This comprised £69m of interest received on average investments of £1 .6bn at a rate of 4.3%,
less £34m interest payable on average borrowings of £580m at a rate of 5.8%.

Last year net interest receivable was £56m, comprising £90m received on average investments of £1.9bn at a rate of 4.7%, less £34m interest
payable on average borrowings of £590m at a rate of 5.8%.

Pensions

The overall Group result includes a £246m (2002 £250m) benefit derived in accordance with SSAP 24, and this amount can be analysed into its
three key components. The accounting charges are based on assumptions on a ‘best estimate’ basis, which reflects the difference between
‘experienced’ performance over the prudent actuarial assumption assumed in the funding rate. This has resulted in a lower regular accounting
cost amounting to £48m of the benefit. The surplus in the Royal Mail Pension Plan (RMPP) allows a further reduction in cost - evaluated by the
Plan actuary using their ‘best estimate’ assumptions - providing £153m benefit, with the interest on the long-term pension debtor of £45m making
up the final element of the benefit.

The new accounting standard FRS 17 - Retirement Benefits, introduces radical changes to accounting for pensions and similar benefits. Royat
Mail is complying with the transitional arrangements as modified by the Accounting Standards Board in November 2002. The balance sheet and
profit and loss aspects are disclosed in note 21 to the Group accounts. These disclosures will be continued for the next two years, with 2005-06
being the frst year in which all pension costs and related information will be reported in accordance with FRS 17.

The FRS 17 requirements mean we are reporting, within the notes to the accounts, a hypothetical deficit of £4.6bn on the RMP fund. This deficit
represents the difference between the market value ofthe Plan’s assets and the assessed value of the Plan's lables atthe balance sheet date
of 30 March 2003. An FRS 17 deficiency of some 28% of fund assets is a similar size to those currently experienced by other large pension
schemes, However, as the RMPP is the Sth largest UK occupational pension scheme, the monetary value appears disproportionaely lage. Asset
values reflect the low stock market valuations atthe end of our financial year, falling to £12. 1bn (from £15.6bn at March 2002) mirroring falls inthe
FTSE 100 from 5272 to 3708 over the same period, At 5272, last year's acoounts reported an FRS 17 surplus of £272m. Liabilities are assessed
using AA bond rates, and as these rates have also fallen, the present value of liabilities has increased to £16.7bn (£15.3bn in 2002).

This FRS 17 assessment of our Pension Pian produces a hypothetical snapshot of its finances at a single point in the life of a pension fund
(typically 50 years and beyond). By using a snapshot approach, the asset valuation is highly sensitive to timing effects. Recent short-term
fluctuations in stock market valuations would have changes this position by several £100m if taken only two or three days apart. To further
illustrate this point, the recovery in the FTSE equity values between the balance sheet date and 28 April 2003 would have reduced the declared
deficit by over £600m. It is therefore important to separate this FRS 17 snapshot from the long-term Pension Plan valuation by an independent
actuary under the Scheme rules, and a separate review of this on behalf of the Trustees is being carried out as at 31 March 2003. Although the
result of the actuary's work is likely to produce a substantially lower disclosed deficit when results are available in the autumn, we are not
‘complacent. The sustained lower stock market valuations will undoubtedly mean that we no longer anticipate benefits from a pension surplus that
we have enjoyed for the past 13 years. We have also made allowances in our stretegic plans for additional pension payments until the deficit is
cleared. This is likely to generate changes to our pensions costs in 2003-04, remove the reduction due to surplus benefits (shown as £153m in.
note 21 to the Group accounts) and require annual deficiency payments in the order of some £100m unti the deficit is cleared. This amount is
subject to agreement with the Trustees of an approved funding plan.

Financial Review (continued)

Regulation
The Postal Services Commission (Postcomm) was created as the independent Regulator for the UK postal industry in 2000, Subsequently, Royal
Mail was granted its first licence, which required it to provide a universal postal service at affordable prices. Currently, several other companies
have also been granted licences.

During the year, Royal Mail accepted Postcomm's proposals for a second price contol over a three-year period starting 1 April 2003. This allows
Royal Mail to increase its prices by approximately 3% immediately, followed by a conventional RPI-1% approach in the second and third years.
Although Royal Mail finally accepted these proposals, it has been highly critical of the process, which took almost a year to complete,

Royal Mail has very recently received the results of Postcomm’s determination on access, which it believes could significantly damage the fabric
of the business and its ability to provide the universal service, Royal Mall is not against access as long as the price imposed by Postcomm does
not undermine the uniform tariff and allows it to make a commercial retum. However, Postcomm's proposals to introduce competition, including
access to our network, could eventually reduce revenues by over £1bn, and the Group continues to rigorously defend this position with
Postcomm.

Postcomm have published their draft work programme for 2003, which includes work on Royal Mail's cost structure, regulatory accounts and
fundamentally, the definition and development ofthe universal service,

Major project investment

We continue the drive to modernise our infrastructure. During the year, the Group invested £297m (of which £104m was capital expenditure)
‘through our key strategic programmes. This included £133m to upgrade the mails and parcels infrastructure and services, £87m to develop the
Universal Banking capability, £35m to provide a high quality enterprise-wide IT environment and £42m on a range of other key initiatives.

Future prospects
The performance for 2002-03 at a loss from operations of £197m was significantly better than our target and keeps us in line fo achieve our
Renewal Plan objective for 2004-05.

Continued progress through 2003-04 and 2004-05 does critically depend on reaping the benefits of the strategic programmes that we have
embarked upon. Thus, the introduction of new business models and service pattems in UK mails and parcels, capitalising on the new
international mails faciity at Langley with its latest technology, new business opportunities for the Post Office network, urban Post Office closures
and successful outsourcing of non-core activities will continue to be key in driving the business back to profitability and positive cash flows. At the
same time, we have to mitigate the financial consequences of delays fo postal tariff increases, higher National Insurance costs and increases to
‘our pension contributions.

We plan to maintain a reasonable investment in our infrastructure through a £253m capital expenditure programme next year.

Our move to a single delivery at a consistent time six days a week with other efficiency measures across the Group will result in a further 17,000
jobs becoming redundant over the next three years. (This is over and above the 13,000 disclosed in last year's accounts but inline with our
original announcement of 30,000).

The Board are encouraged by this year’s results and remain committed to the remaining two years ofthe three-year Renewal Programme. We
expect to continue to reduce trading losses and move back into profit next year.

Report on Directors’ Remuneration

‘The Board is responsible for the framework and costs of executive remuneration and the material terms of the service contracts offered to all
Directors, which require the consent of the Secretary of State. The Remuneration Committee's role is to develop the remuneration policy for
executive Directors and specifically, to recommend their salaries, benefits, including bonuses, pensions, and other terms and conditions of
employment. The Committee also recommends terms for their cessation of employment. No Director is involved in determining his or her own
remuneration.

The Remuneration Committee is made up wholly of non executive Directors as oulined above. Throughout the year, the Company has applied
the principles in Section 1 of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance (the Code) and has complied with the Code.

In the performance of its rote, the Committee has access to professional advisers within the Company. The Committee commissioned no direct
external advice during the period but sought via the Company advice from Hay Group on benchmark remuneration package comparators, Watson
Wyatt regarding pensions arrangements for certain executive Directors, and Emst & Young's Human Capital Division in regard fo the Long-Term
incentive Plan.

Policy on remuneration of Directors

The Company's policy on Directors’ remuneration is that the overall remuneration package should be sulficiently competitive to attract and retain
‘executives of the necessary quality in a complex business and a competitive international market place. The package consists of basic salary,
benefits, annual performance-related bonuses, pensions and a Long-Term Incentive Plan with a significant proportion being based on
performance and the achievement of demanding targets. Consideration is given to pay and employment policies elsewhere in the Group,
especially when determining annual salary increases.

The Remuneration Committee, having received consent from the Secretary of State, has now implemented its proposals to realign executive
Directors’ remuneration packages to support the Company's Renewal Plan, whilst ensuring the rewards are market-competitive. All executive
Directors are on service contracts which have been changed where necessary to reflect best commercial practice, and introduced in conjunction
with the new Long-Term Incentive Plan. The Company has supplemented the annual performance-related cash bonus with a transparent Long-
Term Incentive Plan based on three-year business renewal targets. The relative importance of the performance-related element of remuneration
thas been significantly increased, with Directors entitled to receive substantial performance-related payments, but only on achieving demanding
targets based on measures aligned to returns over the longer term.

The fees of the Chairman and the non executives are agreed with the Secretary of State, and are currently £20,000 per annum and £30,000 per
annum respectively, Additional fees are paid to the Chairs and members of committees.

Remuneration packages for executive Directors comprise the folowing elements:

Basic salary
Salaries are reviewed annually and appropri
Performance, increased individual responsi

increases are recommended where the Committee believes that it is necessary to reflect
ties and market levels,

Performance-related personal annual bonus

The Chairman and executive Directors may earn a performance-related bonus for achievement of financial and customer targets. These bonuses
are based on targets set each year in line with the Renewal Plan and agreed with the Shareholder, The maximum annual bonus for all executive
Directors, except the Executive Deputy Chairman and Chief Executive of Royal Mail Group plc, is 40% of basic pay. The Executive Deputy
Chairman and Chief Executive of Royal Mail Group ple can achieve a maximum of 75%; the non executive Chairman may eam an annual
performance-related bonus of £180,000. 80% of potential bonus earings relate to financial performance and 20% fo the achievement of
customer service targets. The Chief Executive of Post Office Limited can achieve a maximum of 40% of basic pay based upon achievement of
financial targets of Post Office Limited (80%), the Group's financial targets (16%) and customer service standards (4%).

Benefits
Benefits incorporate all benefits arising from their employment. In the main, these relate to the provision of company cars, death-in-service benefit
and health insurance plus the cash-equivalent of any benefits not taken.

Pensions

The Group has a lability o pay pensions in respect of Directors’ services and for some executive Directors makes contributions to pension
‘schemes for this purpose. The Company has set up a Funded Unapproved Retirement Benefit Scheme (FURBS). The FURBS will provide
benefits to Directors and employees whose contributions to the Company scheme are restricted by the Inland Revenue earnings cap.

‘The Company recently introduced a Long-Term Incentive Plan for its most senior managers, which was approved by the Secretary of State for
application to the executive Directors. The objectives of the Long-Term Incentive Plan are to incentivise the delivery of the long-term business
goals of the Group and to reward success in achieving or exceeding these goals over a three-year period.

The Plan consists of Annual Performance Awards and Bonus Awards, both of which are made at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
Annual Performance Awards will be accrued on a sliding scale above a threshold level of financial performance of the Group, in line with the
Renewal Plan operating profit targets, and subject to satisfactory personal performance. The Renewal Plan operating profit targets have been
agreed with Government, our sole shareholder and are based on moving the Group from a foss from operations of £318m in 2001-02 to a profit,
before the cost of the ‘Share in Success’ scheme and Long-Term Incentive Plan awards, of £400m in 2004-05. Individual senior managers are
eligible for annual awards of up to 37.5% of their basic salary if the Group achieves 120% of the agreed target.

Report on Directors’ Remuneration (continued)

‘The award for on-target performance is 25% of basic salary and no award is made below 87.5% of the agreed target. The Bonus Award element
‘of the scheme allows the Remuneration Committee to award into the Plan up to 50% of their personal performance-related annual bonus, taking
into account individual preferences.

At the end of the three-year period, the value of these annual accrued awards together with any deferred bonus elements will be paid out in cash
and enhanced by up to 33% if the cumulative target over the 3 years is met. The maximum enhancement is 100% if the cumulative target over
the three years is exceeded by 178%.

The Remuneration Committee may, ifit is appropriate for the retention of key senior managers, permit a further period of deferral with
enhancement beyond the proposed three-year period.

All awards under the Long-Term Incentive Plan are subject to payments being made under the ‘Share in Success’ scheme to all our people. If no
payments are made to our people under the ‘Share in Success’ scheme, no Annual Performance Awards will be paid and there will be no
enhancement to Bonus Awards.

The ‘Share in Success’ scheme is designed to pay £800 to all our qualifying people for achieving on-target profits forthe financial year ending
‘arch 2005, and up to £1,200 per person if stretch targets are achieved.

No fees (2002 nil) were paid to third partes in respect of services provided by Directors.

The figures in the table represent emoluments eamed and receivable as Directors during the financial year, whenever paid. Such emoluments are
normally paid in the same financial year with the exception of the annual performance-related bonus, which is paid in the year following that in
which it is earned. Under the new Long-Term Incentive Plan, a proportion no greater than 50% of this bonus may be made as an award under the
Plan by the Remuneration Committee, taking into account executive Director preferences.

The above table includes any benefits or expenses paid to the Director on their recruitment. In this respect, Tony McCarthy received
compensation for costs incurred on departing his previous employer of £125,000.

John Roberts’ basic salary included six-months pay in lieu of notice amounting to £119,108.
Unaudited information

As required by the Shareholder, in determining the appropriate level of annual bonus for 2002-03, the Committee has taken into account the
performance of the Company against the year's financial and service targets, and the extent to which the Company is ontrack with its three-year
Renewal Plan,

The profit performance of the Company at operating level has exceeded the first-year Renewal Plan target by £120m (38%).

(On customer service, the Committee has taken into account performance against the licence targets agreed with Postcomm, both in terms of
achieved fevels and year-on-year improvement. Of the 15 targets applying to the mails businesses, only three were achieved in ful. However, 14
showed year-on-year cumulative improvements and the 15* matched last years level. In addition, the queuing performance target for Post Office
Limited showed sufficient improvement inthe final two months of the year to meet Postcomm’s criterion for this target to be dropped from the
licence.

In judging progress against the Renewal Plan, the Committee has looked at the status of the key Renewal Programmes. Some but not all are
behind schedule, however, the Company has secured additonal benefits in other areas to compensate. The Committee is satisfied that the
‘underlying and sustainable expenditure performance of the Company is in line with the requirements of the Renewal Plan going forward.

Pensions

The Group normally offers its most senior people membership of the Royal Mail Senior Executive Pension Plan (RMSEPP). Details of RMSEPP
are set out in note 21 fo the accounts. The Plan is a funded, Inland Revenue-approved final salary occupational pension scheme. The scheme.
provides for a two-thirds final pensionable salary at normal retirement age, subject to the necessary pensionable service and Inland Revenue
earings cap, Pensions in payment are increased annually inline wth Retail Prices Index (RPI), subject in some cases to a cap. Pensions are
also payable to dependants on the death of the member and a lump sum is payable if death occurs in service.

For senior executives whose membership of the RMSEPP is restricted by the earnings cap, pension provision is made by a combination of the
Company scheme and an appropriate Funded Unapproved Retirement Benefits Scheme (FURBS) or equivalent. Gross employer contribution
rales range between 40% and 55% of base pay above the earnings cap. The Company has made provision for Elmar Toime, Adam Crozier and
Tony McCarthy at a rate of 40% pending final resolution of these new Directors’ pension arrangements. The total provision made for FURBS is
£167,740 {2002 £100,000). In addition, David Mills receives cash supplements of 24.2% for earings below the pensions cap, and 40% for
earnings above, giving a total of £80,754.

Disclosure of Directors’ pension transfer values is required under two separate requirements:

* Stock Exchange Listings Rules: the requirements are the same as that disclosed in last year's accounts and are designed
to place a value on the increase in Directors’ accrued benefits during the period. The transfer value is calculated on the
basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11 and excludes Directors’ contributions.

‘* Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002: this is a new requirement and is designed to assess the change in
‘transfer values during the year, taking into account movement in investment market conditions. Falls in market values
may generate a negative movement in the transfer values.

The transfer values disclosed represent a potential lablty of the Company rather than any remuneration due fo the individual and cannot be
‘meaningfully aggregated with annual remuneration, as its not money the individual is entited to receive.

The pension entitlements (under Stock Exchange Listing Rules) of the Directors at the year end were:

John Roberts was an employee of Royal Mail forthe previous 35 years and, more recently, a member of the RMSEPP until his early retirement
on 31 December 2002, on a pension of £161,161 per annum. As at the end of the previous financial year, Johin Roberts had a deferred pension
entitlement of £149,869 per annum or an immediate pension entitlement of £127,197 per annum after allowing fr the early retirement reduction
factor. The increase in the accrued pension of £33,964 represents the increase (net of inflation) in his immediate pension entitlement, arising from
his departure. The effect of early retirement on the transfer value shown in the above table is £663,000. The balance of £1, 100,733 is attributable
to normal pension accruals and a favourable market movement at the ime of retirement.

During the year Marisa Cassoni brought a transfer payment of £916,751 into the RMSEPP. This provided additional accrued pension of £104,036
per annum. The effect ofthis additional pension has been to reduce Marisa Cassoni's future accrual rate within RMSEPP from 1/30th to 1/60th,

Tony McCarthy and David Mills are also on a 1/60th basis due to the effect of retained benefits from previous employers. All other executive
Directors are members of RMSEPP on a 1/30th basis.

Accounting policies and general notes

The following accounting policies and general notes apply throughout the Group:
‘A) Going concern

The Group's accounts for the year ended 31 March 2002 noted an uncertainty over how the Group's future cash requirements were to be
financed. The required financing was to cover it two principal businesses, Royal Mail Group covering mails and parcels and Post Office Limited
covering the Post Office network.

During the year, loan documentation was signed with Government giving Royal Mail Group plc access to £1,044m of financing on commercial
terms. Based upon current cashflow projections, the Directors believe that this is sufficient to meet the foreseeable funding needs of this
business. All relevant conditions precedent attaching to this financing, including a satisfactory outcome to Postcomm’s price contol proposals,
have been satisfied. The business is now able to draw down against this facility, as and when it Is required. For this reason, the Directors have
‘concluded that there Is no longer any uncertainty over the financing of this business.

In respect of Post Office Limited, agreement has been reached between Royal Mail Holdings plc and Government on how financial support wit be
provided to the company. Post Office Limited's current strategic plans indicate that funding of £0.7bn is required for operational needs and a
further £1.2bn working capital facility, The agreed funding package is made up as follows:

(2) the write-off of indebtedness of £464m owed to Royal Mail Group against a special Royal Mail Group reserve backed by the Group's past
surpluses;

(b) rural network payments of £150m per annum forthe next three years to support the maintenance ofthe rural network of Post Offices;
{o) further advances from the Royal Mail special reserve to meet Post Office Limited's projected net cash outflows until 2006-07.

A loan facility of up to £1.2bn will also be granted by Government to fund working capital needs, arising from the withdrawal by the Department for
Work and Pensions of advance funding for beneiit payments being made on its behalf over the Post Office network.

All of the above have been agreed and the £1.2bn loan facility is in the course of being documented,

‘After careful consideration of the Group's cash flow projections, the Directors have concluded that the Group will continue in operational existence
forthe foreseeable future.

B) Basis of preparation

The accounts on pages 24 to 55 have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards under the histori cost
accounting convention and the requirements of the Companies Act 1985, except forthe issue described in accounting policy note (i) and
quantified in note 11.

Royal Mait Holdings ple (the Company) has not presented its own profit and loss account, as permitted by the Companies Act 1985 s230(3).
However, the results of the Company for the year are disclosed in note 28.

No new Financial Reporting Standards, which affect the presentation of these accounts, have been issued by the Accounting Standards Board.
C) Financial year

The financial year ends on the last Sunday in March and acoordingly, these accounts cover the S2-week period ended 30 March 2003 (2002 53
weeks).

D) Basis of consolidation

‘The accounts consolidate the accounts of Royal Mail Holdings plc and its subsidiary undertakings,

Entities, other than subsidiary undertakings, in which the Group has a participating interest and over whose operating and financial policies the
Group exercises a significant influence, are treated as associates or, where the Group exercises joint contol, joint ventures. In the consolidated
aecounts, associates are accounted for using the equity method and joint ventures are accounted for using the gross equity method.

‘The Group operates through business units that make use of each other's services in order fo take advantage of Group synergies, having regard
to the mutual dependencies that exist. The interbusiness charges recognise these dependencies. The Board's policy is to maintain controls to
ensure adherence to appropriate pricing principles.

E) Turnover

Tumover comprises revenue receivable directly from customers as adjusted for an assessment of prepaid stamps and meter sales still in the
hands of the public. Turnover excludes VAT,

Itis not considered that there is a material difference between turnover by origin and destination.

Royal Mail Holdings plc

Accounting policies and general notes (continued)
F) Goodwill

Goodwill arising on acquisition, being the excess of the consideration over the fair value of the separately identifiable net assets acquired, is
capitalised and amortised on a straighttine basis over its estimated useful economic life of 20 years. Its reviewed for impairment at the end of
the first full financial year following acquisition and thereafter as appropriate.

G) Tangible fixed assets
(i) Tangible fixed assets are recognised at cost, including direcly attributable costs in bringing the asset into working condition for its intended
use

(i) Depreciation of tangible fixed assets is provided on a straightJine basis by reference to original cost, and to the remaining useful economic
lives of assets and their estimated residual values. The lives assigneed to major categories of tangible fixed assets are:

Property:
freehold buildings up to 60 years
leasehold land and buildings the shortest of the periad of the lease, 60
years or the estimated remaining useful life
Plant and machinery 3-15 years
Motor vehicles 1= 12years
Fixtures and equipment:
‘office machines 3-12 years
computers 2-7 years
other 4-15 years

(i) impairment reviews of fixed assets are performed annually for assets with an estimated remaining useful life in excess of 50 years, and
additionally where there is an indication of impairment as defined by FRS 11.

H) Leasing and hire purchase

Assets acquired under finance leases or hire purchase agreements are capitalised and treated as tangible fixed assets. Depreciation is provided
accordingly and the capital element of future rentals is included within creditors. Interest on such contracts is charged to the profit and loss
account over the period of the contract and represents a charge that relates to the proportion of the capital repayments outstanding. All other
leases are regarded as operating leases and rentals are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

I) Investments

(i)In the Company's accounts, the investments in subsidiary undertakings, associates and joint ventures are stated at cost less provision for
impairment for acquired undertakings and at net asset value for internally formed companies.

(ii) Other fixed asset investments are stated at cost fess provision for impairment.

(ii) Government gil-edged securities, held as current assets, are stated at market value at the balance sheet date and the difference between
cost and market value is taken to the profit and loss account. This treatment is a departure from UK accounting rules, which stipulate that
unrealised profits be credited to a revaluation reserve. In the opinion ofthe Directors, the treatment adopted is necessary to present a true and fair
view. The accounting treatment adopted represents a fairer reflection of the investment return, All other current asset investments are treated
according to standard UK accounting rules.

J) Stocks

‘Stocks comprise unissued stores, such as uniforms, bicycles and stationery, and in the case of counter services also include retail stocks. Al!
stocks are carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value.

K) Deferred tax

Deferred tax is generally provided in full on timing differences at the balance sheet dale, at rates expected to apply when the tax liability (or asset)
crystallises based on substantially enacted tax rates and law. Timing differences arise from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in
taxation computations in periods different fram those in which they are included in the accounts.

Deferred tax is not recognised in the following instances:

~ on gains on disposal of fixed assets where, on the basis of available evidence, itis more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over
into replacement assets and charged to tax only when there is a commitment to dispose of those replacement assets;

- on unremitied earings of subsidiaries and associates where there is no commitment to remit those earnings; and

~ deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the Directors consider that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable
profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.

RMG00000314

Royal Mail Holdings plc

Accounting policies and general notes (continued)

L) Pensions and other post-retirement benefits

Membership of occupational pension schemes (as detailed in note 21) is open to most permanent UK employees of the Group. All members of
defined benefit schemes are contracted out of the earnings-related part of the State pension scheme. Overseas subsidiaries make separate
arrangements for the provision of pensions and other post-retirement benefits,

The defined benefit schemes are financed on the basis that the combined current service contributions payable by the employees and employer
are sufficient to cover the cost of the benefits which are expected to acorue in the future to members. The charge to the profit and loss account is
calculated so as to spread variations from regular cost and to amortise the surplus or deficit over the expected remaining service lives of the
employees. The assets of the schemes are held in separate trustee administered funds.

Valuations of the defined benefit schemes are carried out by independent professionally qualified actuaries at intervals not normally exceeding
three years, as determined by the Trustees, The accounting charge for pensions refiects best estimate assumptions as required by SSAP 24,
whereas the funding arrangements use a more cautious assumption for investment retums to assess the cash position of the Royal Mail Pension
Plan (RMPP). This results in the cash payments being higher than the accounts charge for the RMPP. The difference is dealt with through the
long-term pensions debtor in the balance sheet.

M) Research and development

Expenditure on research and development is written off in the year in which itis incurred.

N) Foreign currencies

‘Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction (or at the contracted rate if the transaction is
covered by a forward foreign currency contract). Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of
‘exchange ruling at the balance sheet date (or the appropriate forward contract rate). All differences are taken to the profit and loss account with
the exception of differences on foreign currency borrowings, which are used to finance or provide a hedge against foreign equity investments.
These are taken directly to reserves together with the exchange difference on the carrying amount of the related investments. Tax charges and
credits attributable to exchange differences on those borrowings are also dealt with in reserves. The accounts of overseas subsidiary
undertakings are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and the differences arising from the translation of opening net
investments are taken to reserves.

©) Derivative instruments
The Group uses forward foreign currency contracts to reduce exposure to foreign exchange rates. The Group's policy is that its derivative
instruments qualify for hedge accounting when the folowing criteria are met:

~ the instrument must be related to a foreign currency asset or liability that is probable and whose characteristics have been identifed;

= itrmust involve the same currency as the hedged item; and

—it must reduce the risk of foreign currency movements on the Group's operations.

The contracted rates are used to record the hedged item. As a result, gains and losses are offset against the foreign exchange gains or losses on
the related financial assets and liabilities. Where the instrument is used to hedge a committed or probable future transaction, gains or losses are
not recognised until the transaction occurs,

In addition, over-the-counter derivative products are used to manage both the commodity and foreign exchange risks associated with the fuel
procurement policy.

6 Taxation (continued)

(©) Factors that may affect future tax charges

The Group has unrecognised deferred tax assets of £146m (2002 £57m) relating to tax losses in subsidiaries that are avallable to offset against future
taxable profits of those companies. The Group also has unrecognised deferred tax assets of 158m (2002 £126m) relating mainly to fixed asset ting

differences,

Deferred fax assets have not been recognised in respect of these items as they have arisen in companies which are loss-making and the losses, in
particular, may not be used to offset future taxable profits elsewhere in the Group. The unrecognised deferred tax assets will be recognised in future to
the extent that suitable taxable profits are expected to become availabe.

The Group has capital losses carried forward, the tax effect of which is approximately £12m (2002 £1 1m). These may be set-off in future against capital
gains. The Group has rolled over capital gains, the tax effect of which totals £75m (2002 £67m).Itis expected that gains on assets sold in the year will

‘de fully rolled over in due course.

HM Government confirmed in July 2002 that the funds set aside for the possible payment of prior year dividends are now considered to be part of past
surpluses. Accordingly, the amounts in the dividend reserve have been transferred to the profit and loss reserve within Royal Mail Holdings ple. The past
surpluses of the Group are dealt with in accordance withthe restrictions applied to the Mails Reserve created under section 72 of the Postal Services Act
2000, as detaited below.

The Mails Reserve of £1,845m was created in Royal Mail Group pic on 3 February 2003, following directions issued by the Secretary of Stata for Trade
and Industry under section 72 of the Postal Services Act 2000. Interest subsequently eamed on the assets backing this reserve, amounting to £7m, was
transferred into the Mails Reserve at the year end date. The amounts allocated to the reserve in accordance with these directions are to be applied as if
they were profits available for distribution within the meaning of section 263() of the Companies Act 1985 (distributions to be made out of profits).

Plan (RMSEPP) Pension Pian (CSEPP)

Royal Mail Retirement Savings Plan Consignia Retirement UK employees Defined contribution

Various other small-scale schemes Overseas subsidiary Definad contribution
operated by overseas subsidiaries employees

The RMPP consists of two sections, Section A&B and Section C that were created by the merger of two former schernes with effect from 1 Api! 2000,
The terms of the merger require separate consideration ofthe financial position of each section for upto six years after the date of the merger. The main
requirement is that a funding surplus in one section cannot be used to offset a funding deficiency inthe other. Thus, funding might sill be needed for
Section C even if Section A&B was experiencing a contribution holiday.

The pension charge was £264m for the defined benefit schemes, which includes £200m in respect of redundancy provisions and £m for defined
contribution schemes (2002£276m, £200m and £ 1m respectively). The overall Group resutt includes a £246m (2002 £250) benefit derived in
aocotdance with SSAP 24 on the basis set out below. The accounting charges are based on assumptions on a best estimate’ basis, which reflects the
difference between ‘experienced’ performance over the prudent actuarial assumption assumed in the funding rate, This has resulted in a lower regular
accounting cost amounting to £48m (2002 £53m) of the benefit. The surplus in the Royal Mail Pension Plan allows a further reduction in cost - evaluated
by the Scheme actuary using their best estimate’ assumptions ~ providing £153m benefit (2002 £164m). This surplus is being amortised over 12 years,
the average remaining sence lives of employees. The interest onthe long-term pension debtor of £4Sm (2002 £33m) makes up the final element of the
benefit.

Valuations of the defined benefit schemes are carried out at intervals not normally exceeding three years as determined by the trustees. The latest
actuarial assessments of the RMPP and the RMSEPP were carried out as at 31 March 2000 and 1 April 2001 respectively. These were performed using
an assumed rate of inflation of 3% for both schemes. Investment retums real were assumed to be 4.75% and 4.25% respectively. Pay increases real
were assumed to be 1.5% and 3% respectively and pensions, both in payment and deferred, were assumed to increase at 3% for both schemes. The
market value of assets at the latest actuarial assessments was £15,383m for the RMPP Section A&B (as at 31 March 2000), £2,434m for the RMPP
Section C (as at 31 March 2000) and £60m for the RMSEPP (as at 1 April 2001). The asset cover of the benefits accrued to members after allowing for
future increases in earnings was 115% for the RMPP Section A&B (as al 31 March 2000), 109% for the RMPP Section C (as at 31 March 2000) and
77% for the RMSEPP (as at 1 April 2001). The next full valuation of both the RMPP and the RMSEPP is being carried out as at 31 March 2003.

‘These accounts have been produced in accordance with the current accounting standard SSAP 24. The latest pensions accounting standard, FRS 17,
has been adopted by the Group in accordance with the transitional arrangements allowed by that standard. The amendment to FRS 17 announced by
‘the Accounting Standards Board in Novernber 2002 means that disclosures will be phased-in over the three years ending March 2003, March 2004 and
