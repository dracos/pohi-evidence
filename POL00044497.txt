Audit of Post Office® South Warnborough branch, FAD 092904

On Thursday 9" March 2006, I attended the above branch in order to conduct an audit of
accounts, instigated upon information received from your Area Intervention Office

Upon my arrival at about 8.30am, I met Area Intervention Manager, Elaine Ridge, and
Graham Brander, Investigations Manager.

The Subpostmistress, Josephine Hamilton was not in attendance at all throughout the
audit, being too ill. Elaine went to her home address, retrieved the keys, and Graham,
Elaine and myself entered the secure area to commence the audit.

The audit revealed a trading position of £36,583.12 short, broken down thus:

£ 3542658 - Identified asa difference in cash figures

£ 1159.36 - Identified as a difference in stock figures

£ 2.82 + Identified as a difference in foreign currency figures
£36583.12 Total shortage

Due to the disarray of the branch, and our inability to locate essential weekly paperwork,
it was not possible to verify volume stock remittances. This was compounded by a
problem encountered on Horizon requiring it to be rebooted. An additional £61.77
shortage was consequently highlighted by Horizon, which could not be accounted for,
and the total shortage put to late accounts was £36,644.89.

Two amounts in suspense could not be resolved. A figure of £2751.00 has been held in
cash in pouches since September 2004, and is consequently stuck. This cannot be
removed without intervention from Chesterfield. Similarly, a figure of £375 is noted
against ‘vouchers, and likewise cannot be removed locally without intervention from
Chesterfield.

Upon reaching the result Elaine visited Mrs Hamilton, and precautionary suspended her.

Arrangements were made for the transfer of the branch to a temporary Subpostmaster,
Mr Kevin Molloy, who currently runs the branch at Hook (063904). A final account was
produced, and the system was rolled into trading period 12, balance period 1.

All keys and Post Office assets were handed to Mr Molloy, whom checked everything.
