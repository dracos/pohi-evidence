Royal Mail Group Board Governance Questionnaire 2009

Introduction and Summary

This report summarises responses to face to face interviews and a two part questionnaire on the
operation and governance of the Royal Mail Board. All Board Directors were interviewed and all
completed the questionnaire. The interviews were broad ranging and help to provide context for
the questionnaire responses.

The questionnaire has 2 parts:

Part 1 comprises 11 distinct sections and a total of 72 questions on a 1-7 scale, where 1 indicates
dissatisfaction and 7 indicates satisfaction. In addition, respondents are given the opportunity to
write comments under each section.

Part 2 asks respondents to assess the level of Board engagement at Royal Mail for seven business
activities, indicating both their rating for current engagement and desired engagement.

Here, we report on both the quantitative data from the scaled questions and the qualitative data
from the written observations and interviews.

We show, where appropriate, the overall means for individual questions taken from the databank of
a wider sample of Boards drawn mainly from the FTSE 100, but also including not-for-profit and
privately owned enterprises based outside the UK. The databank therefore does not constitute a
directly comparable or random sample, but is included for illustrative purposes and to show where
there may be patterns in high and low scores on other Board surveys using similar questions

Appendix 1 shows questionnaire results by rank order. Appendix 2 shows wider databank means by
rank order. Appendix 3 shows the gap between Royal Mail and the wider databank means.
Appendix 4 shows bar chart comparisons of mean scores for the Board, Executive Directors, Non-
Executive Directors and the wider databank.

Overall, the results show that Board members express satisfaction with various aspects of Board
functioning and governance.

63% of questions in Part 1 are at and above the mean from the wider databank and 69% have a
rating of 5.5 or above on a seven point scale.

Particular strengths are:

Corporate governance (qs 16, 23, 48)

© Board mechanics (qs 1,6,7,8)

e Executive Directors representative of the business (q 28)
e Audit Committee (qs 55-60)

Interview data support these strengths but also indicate areas for improvement which include:
¢ = Clarification of Royal Mail vision and goals

e@ Rebalancing of Board expertise and experience (see also qs 20,21,22)
¢ More strategic discussions (see also qs 14, 44)

Analysis of Interview Responses

Introduction and background

Interviews were conducted face to face in London with all Board Directors. The purpose was to allow
individuals to discuss issues free from the constraints of the questionnaire design; and, at the same
time, to comment on key themes emerging from the pattern of questionnaire responses.

The interviews helped to provide a context for the questionnaire responses.

Many commented on the unique history and context of the RM Board — referencing the shareholder
relationship; mix and scale of operations; demanding market conditions; technological change and
so on. Combined with recent industrial relations issues and possible privatisation initiatives, Board
members described a challenging context of considerable uncertainty and complexity.

In addition, the Board itself is in a period of transition. The Chairman and three NEDs joined during
2009 and another NED is arriving in 2010. Of four Executive Directors two have resigned in recent
months — one of them, the CEO.

Members with longer experience draw a vivid picture of the Board as it developed after 2002
emphasising a CEO influenced NED profile; active involvement in strategy and operations;
engagement with executives; and a clear “turnaround” imperative from operating loss into profit.

All Board members acknowledge that the context has changed over recent years — but that
substantial business challenges remain. How, then, can the Board equip itself to actively shape its
new agenda and meet these challenges?

Board strengths
The interviews confirm some of the more positive questionnaire responses.

They describe a Board which operates to generally high standards of corporate governance and
which is supported by broadly well structured committees. The NEDs are appropriately independent.
Chairman and CEO roles are sufficiently differentiated.

The basic mechanics of the Board (role and scope of Board; number of meetings; provision of
information; access to advice etc) appear to operate well.

NEDs are seen to cover some important areas of competence relating to, for example, the
shareholder relationship and industrial relations. NEDs express positive views of Executive Director
capability. Board members describe a culture of respect within which all have the opportunity to
contribute.

Areas for Improvement

In order to perform to its full potential and recognising the changing composition of the Board there
are opportunities for improvement. There is clear recognition of the need for the Board to be
proactive and to exhibit strong solidarity around objectives and priorities given its distinctive
shareholder relationship.

The result is a sense of frustration which is experienced and reported in a variety of ways:

Big strategic, commercial and operational issues are recognised and need further analysis
and debate by the Board

¢ There is a continuous challenge to ensure fire fighting does not displace reflection on key
issues

The Board needs to reassess its priorities particularly after the General Election

e There was clear momentum towards a part-privatisation of Letters - what next?

The Board needs to take care to focus and avoid being side tracked into detail

¢ Discussions require more focus

¢ Board papers do not match sophisticated analysis and detail with clear indication of strategic
issues for discussion (in this sense the EDs are not helping the NEDs)

© Complexity of issues can encourage members to discuss apparently simpler (but often less
important) issues

e Presentations are too lengthy and at the expense of debate

¢ EDs feel NEDs are supportive but are hungry for increasing challenge from NEDs

e Discussions do not involve enough members of the Board

e Too much time is spent educating NEDs; this limits time for discussion. A changing Board
needs induction away from Board meetings as far as possible

e NED experience mix is in course of necessary adjustment to enable them to place Board
papers in an operational context

e There needs to be increased clarity over decisions and points for action

RMG00000339

Next steps

The issues identified above are interconnected not discrete; and the weight attached to each view
varies by Board Member. But when asked to consider actions that might improve performance
three major themes tend to emerge:

e = Clarification and proactive communication of the RM Board “story” — its vision, goals,
priorities etc

e Rebalancing of the Board to incorporate experience and expertise in vital areas (variously
described as logistics, IT, operational change, retail, customer front line, CEO business focus
etc)

e Tighter, more strategic focus for Board discussions (with associated implications for several
issues: agenda; papers; discussion process/time management/conclusions; approval levels —
ie. what must go to Board etc)

Together with the more detailed observations emerging from Parts 1 and 2 of the questionnaire,
these areas may be the start point for further Board discussion.

Planned reduction to 7 meetings pa is at the low end.

Whilst length of meetings is fine there is a slight bias towards presentations versus discussion.

Overall the board operates to a high standard and the new chairman has improved the
effectiveness of meetings

8 I There is a fine balance to be achieved, between adequate time and allowing too much time,
for a board. Director’s expertise is used, but they are also there to contribute on a wider
spectrum, which does not always seem to happen.

3 More time should be devoted to people issues
g _ Thereis a constant need to ensure the urgent does not crowd out the important.
There also needs to be more granularity about POL's operational performance.
7 Performance reporting is improving. This should enable the executive team to spend more

time on strategic issues.

POL executed the recent post office rationalisation with excellence. Strategy and execution
going forward remain a concern.

8 Chairman’s restructuring of the regular reporting has been a positive. It is very difficult to get
the balance right between strategy and today. The very nature of the business and the stage
of transformation, means that we have to adapt to whatever the key issue of the day is.
However, all issues we are dealing with have an implication for the long term future

10 There are aspects of strategy that we do not consider well enough - notably regulation, where
we take a rather narrow, non-strategic view of issues.

ED
2 Parts of board meetings are productive but many parts end up being informative for non-
execs but less useful for execs due to the lack of insights/added value in return on some
subjects.
5 Time spent on POL performance / issues much improved

3 recruitment of NEDs does not bring about diversity of background or experience

é Generally good constructive relationship

7 With fewer board meetings it will be desirable for non exec's to spend more time in the
business. We should consider whether this should occur on an individual basis or whether it
would be desirable to have a managed program. This would increase exposure to the
organisation below board level too.

8 The current recruitment process will achieve a better balance of relevant experience and
expertise. The style of the organisation is such that the Executives are very open to
involvement with the NED's and their views are actively sought and welcomed.

10 The current Board does not have the right mix of expertise amongst its non-execs, but the
Chairman has put in place a process for correcting this

NED

1 Excellent Board and Committee administration and backup. Consistently high quality and
Supportive.
6 Constant battle to get to the main points through a lot of detail.

7 Generally papers are provided on time. The unfortunate exception was for the strategy
away-days.

8 The quality of information has improved over the last few years, (dramatically) The quality
of support papers is excellent, but the structure of papers some times requires you to go
through a very long an detailed paper to get to the key issue. I do not mean that we do not
need the detail; it is the timing and structure of information provision that may need
reviewing.

10 The paperwork for Board meetings is of a good standard. However, there is not always
clarity as to the key questions that the Board is being asked to answer. And far too much
time in Board meetings is spent on going through pre-circulated papers and presentations,
rather than taking papers as read and providing a tight, brief overview that sets up the
discussion and leaves plenty of time for Board discussion. This inhibits effective Board
engagement. That was particularly marked at the Startegy awayday when much of the
time was absorbed with the executive talking to the non-execs, despite a substantial and
high quality briefing pack.

ED

2 We go to great lengths in a fast changing business/ environment to ensure that the board
are rarely surprised ( if ever )and that they have all the relevant information..........if
anything I think there are times where they perhaps get far too many papers and we need
to do more to ensure they are more concise.

Operating KPI's appear broad and deep (possibly too many at Board level). Financial
performance KPI's focus too heavily at the sales/costs/operating level, and not enough at
the financial sustainability of the company.

The plan provides a sound basis for performance management.

Are goals sufficiently stretching?

Perhaps there is a need to raise the profile of financial services for monitoring in the
Post Office

Strategy development is an evolutionary process, more discussion and debate would add
more value.

The board has less visibility of shareholder communications and feedback than would be
the case in a quoted company.

The provision of performance objectives and monitoring is now well established. The
shareholder is fully briefed about performance.

It is difficult to be sure that the Board is effectively overseeing these key aspects of the
business, given its scale. The Board itself does not communicate with the shareholder,
that resting with the Chairman, Chief Executive and SID.

10

ED

2 Communication with the shareholder is not straightforward - on the face of it we have
one shareholder but in practice different parts of government will often have conflicting
objectives. Most high level contact is, therefore , done by the Chairman/CEO

Board concentrates more on performance than on strategic direction. Shareholder
communication often lacks coordination and tends towards interaction at too low a level
within Government. The Board receive comprehensive financial and operational
performance information.

1 Directors feel able to and do contribute freely to debate. The Chairman and CEO both
encourage this and allow any voice to be heard. The CEO takes constructive criticism well
and is not at all defensive.
3 Succession planning should be more long term.
6 Nice and open
8 There is a learning curve being scaled and peak performance has not yet been achieved.
The degree to which board meetings are a free and frank exchange of views is as much
down to the willingness of the NEDs to contribute, both on their subject and outside their
comfort zone.
10 I think the Board works reasonably on these dimensions but could be a lot better.
ED
2 Although the opportunity is there for interaction it is sometimes too much of a one way
conversation.
9 There are no bars to directors' contributions. However, debates are limited and several of
the Directors seldom contribute.
