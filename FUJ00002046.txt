1.0 Introduction

In May 1996, Fujitsu Services (FS), Royal Mail Group Account (RMGA), formerly ICL (Pathway),
was selected to set up and operate the services to automate counter transactions at Post Offices
throughout the UK.

The requirement to implement a Benefit Payment Service for the Benefit Agency was removed when
the UK Government’s major Private Finance Initiative (PFI) project was changed to a Public Private
Partnership (PPP) project during 1999.

In July 2002, Royal Mail Group Account was awarded a contract to provide a Network Banking
Service (NBS), which initially supports several On-line counter transaction types. In September 2002
this contract was extended to include a Debit Card system interfacing with National Westminster
Streamline as Merchant Acquirer.

The purpose of this policy document is to lay the foundation that enables Royal Mail Group Account

to protect the integrity, availability and confidentiality of all assets associated with the services. It

also enables Royal Mail Group Account to comply with legislative and commercial requirements.
1.1 Service Overview

The agreement is a PPP project, whereby Royal Mail Group Account automates approximately
14,000 Post Offices and provides the infrastructure which enables users to make automated
payments at outlets throughout the UK.

e Automated Payment Services (APS) and (AP ADC).
e Electronic Point Of Sale Service (EPOSS).

¢ Logistics Feeder Service (LFS).

e Network Banking Service (NBS).

e The Debit Card System (DCS).

¢ Pin Pad authentication for NBS, DCS, incorporating EMV Chip and PIN
e Bureau de Change.

e ETop Ups.

e NS&I.

e DVLA, incorporating PAF.

e SAP Hosting

¢ MoneyGram

The services are designed to provide secure transaction, accounting and payment facilities; hence
particular attention is focused upon the security aspects of the services throughout their life cycle.

The SAP Hosting solution is jointly managed by FS and Prism, who share operational responsibility
for the system. Security of the solution should be based on the current security agreement between
POST OFFICE LTD and FS for running the Horizon systems. Areas deemed relevant to SAP are:

2.0 Security Policy

This Security Policy specifies mandatory security requirements, which all Royal Mail Group Account
staff must be compliant with. Any breaches of these requirements must be brought to the attention of

Royal Mail Group Account’s Security Policy must be compatible with POST OFFICE LTD security
policy. The interfaces between Royal Mail Group Account and all external organisations must be
clearly defined and formally agreed with the companies concerned.

To ensure FS complies with their security obligations for subcontractors involved in development
activities they are subject to individual NDA agreements with Royal Mail Group Account.
Commercial off the shelf (COTS) products are provided by the appropriate product suppliers and
subject to their own legal terms and conditions which FS must comply with.

This document fits into the structure illustrated below, with the BS ISO/IEC 17799:2005 Code of
Practice being used as a basis for Royal Mail Group Account’s Security Controls and Policy, and it
is available within FS Intranet Site. Lower level implementation standards are incorporated into

2.3 Policy Review

Once approved, this policy document must be formally reviewed annually based on a risk
assessment. Formal reviews must take place after any major system change / new release, significant
security incident or occurrence of fraud.

Responsibilities for approval, review and issue of Royal Mail Group Account’s Security Policy and
Procedures are defined in section 5

3.0 Objectives

This document is approved by Post Office Limited (POL) & Royal Mail Group Account
(RMGA) senior management. It defines Royal Mail Group Account’s policy for the
protection of its assets, (including hardware, applications, databases, network, people and
documentation) against loss of confidentiality, integrity and availability. It also enables
Royal Mail Group Account to comply with legislative and commercial requirements.

Royal Mail Group Account’s policy statement (which is essentially the same as the corporate policy
statement used by Group (FS) is:

t is the policy of Fujitsu Services Royal Mail Group Account, to provide a secure working
nvironment for the protection of employees, and also to ensure the security of all assets owned by
r entrusted to Royal Mail Group Account. This includes assets owned by Post Office its clients its
‘ustomers and its other suppliers which are entrusted to Royal Mail Group Account, and to ensure
he confidentiality, integrity and availability of all information conveyed, processed, stored and
ransmitted.

Royal Mail Group Account must establish an infrastructure that will minimise and control liabilities
to itself and Post Office Ltd.

requirements can be communicated throughout Royal Mail Group Account. This ensures that all
parties are fully aware of their responsibilities and legal obligations.

commercial practices for security. Royal Mail Group Account’s aim is to be fully compliant with BS
ISO/IEC 17799: 2005.

3.2 IT Security Objectives

Royal Mail Group Account’s overall IT security objective can be summarised as achieving the
requirement expressed in the following:

1. Security measures in Royal Mail Group Account’s IT systems must ensure appropriate
confidentiality, integrity and availability of services, software components and data, whether in
storage or in transit.

2. Physical and logical access to the IT systems must be controlled, with access granted selectively,
and permitted only where there is a specific need. Access must be limited to persons, systems
with appropriate authorisation and a “need to know” requirement.

3. Authentication, whereby a user’s claimed identity is verified, is essential before any access is
granted to any IT system. Authentication mechanisms are also required to ensure that trust
relationships can be established between communicating components within, and external to,
Royal Mail Group Account’s services.

4. All users of Royal Mail Group Account’s services must be individually accountable for their
actions. Accountability for information assets must be maintained by assigning owners, who
should be responsible for defining who is authorised to access the information. If responsibilities
are delegated then accountability must remain with the nominated owner of the asset.

nr

Audit mechanisms are required to monitor, detect and record events that might threaten the
security of the Royal Mail Group Account services or any service(s) to which it is connected.
Regular analysis of audit trails is essential to facilitate the identification and investigation of
security breaches.

6. Alarm mechanisms are required to alert security personnel to the occurrence of security
violations that could seriously threaten the secure operation of Royal Mail Group Account’s
services. These alarms should be used to trigger prompt investigation and remedial action in
order to minimise the impact of any security breach.

7. Royal Mail Group Account will monitor all developments and operations that its services are
performing to ensure a high level of confidence that all information is being protected during
processing, transmission and storage to the approved security controls and policies.

8. All identified security requirements must be addressed before giving any worker access to Royal
Mail Group Account information, documentation or assets.

4.0 Legal Obligations

Royal Mail Group Account must remain fully compliant with all relevant legislation and regulations.

In addition to the existing legislative obligations, identified in section 10.2, it is important to track
and anticipate emerging UK and European regulations that could affect Royal Mail Group Account’s
operation.

5.0 Security Management Structure

Royal Mail Group Account’s Business Unit Director has ultimate responsibility for security within
Royal Mail Group Account.

5.9 Risk management Responsibilities

Senior Management will establish criteria against which security risk will be evaluated for all
characteristics of RMGA including its organisational structure its locations, assets and technology,
and including details of, and justifications for any exclusions from the scope, including the following;

5.9.1 Defining the risk assessment approach of RMGA:

e Identifying a risk assessment methodology that is suited to the ISMS, and the
identified business information security, legal and regulatory requirements.

e Develop criteria for accepting risks and identify the acceptable levels of risk. The
risk assessment methodology selected shall ensure that risk assessments
produce comparable and reproducible results.

5.9.2 Risks are identified:

e Identifying the assets within the scope of the ISMS, and the owners of these
assets. The term ‘owner’ identifies an individual or entity that has approved
management responsibility for controlling the production, development,
maintenance, use and security of the assets. The term ‘owner’ does not mean
that the person actually has any property rights to the asset.

e Within PO Account this function is split into two areas, business risk and security
risk. The policy for managing vulnerabilities is defined in RS/POL/010

e Identifying the threats to those assets.

e Identifying the vulnerabilities that might be exploited by the threats.

e Identifying the impacts that losses of confidentiality, integrity and availability may
have on the assets.

5.9.3 Analysis and evaluation of the risks:

e Assessing the business impacts upon the organization that might result from
security failures, taking into account the consequences of a loss of
confidentiality, integrity or availability of the assets.

e Assessing the realistic likelihood of security failures occurring in the light of
prevailing threats and vulnerabilities, and impacts associated with these assets,
and the controls currently implemented.

e Estimating the levels of risks.

e Determining whether the risks are acceptable or require treatment using the
criteria for accepting risks defined above.

5.9.4 Identification and evaluation options for the treatment of risks:

e Applying appropriate controls;

e Knowingly and objectively accepting risks, providing they clearly satisfy the
organisation's policies and the criteria for accepting risks see above.

e Avoiding risks,

e Transferring the associated business and security risks to other parties, e.g.
insurers, suppliers.

NOTE:

5.9.5 Control objectives and controls for the treatment of risks.

Control objectives and controls will be selected and implemented to meet the
requirements identified by the risk assessment and risk treatment process. This
selection will take account of the criteria for accepting risks as well as legal,
regulatory and contractual requirements.

The control objectives and controls from BS ISO/IEC 27001:2005 Annex A will
be selected as part of this process to cover the identified requirements.

The control objectives and controls listed in BS ISO/IEC 27001:2005 annex A
are not exhaustive and additional control objectives and controls may also be
selected.

5.9.6 Approve all proposed residual risks.
5.9.7 Authorise the implementation and operation of the ISMS.

5.9.8 Ensure the preparation of a Statement of Applicability that
includes the following:

The control objectives and controls selected and the reasons for their selection
The control objectives and controls currently implemented.

The exclusion of any control objectives and controls in BS ISO/IEC 27001:2005
annex A and the justification for their exclusion.

The Statement of Applicability provides a summary of decisions concerning risk treatment.

Justifving exclusions provides a cross-check that no controls have been inadvertently omitted.

5.10 Business Function Monitoring Responsibilities

The description “Business Function Monitoring” has been used to describe Royal Mail Group
Account personnel assigned to roles with particular responsibility for Audit.

Royal Mail Group Account’s Audit Manager is the normal line manager for this group; hence many
of the activities assigned to Business Function Monitoring are in support of the functions listed in
section 5.8.

Wherever possible, Business Function Monitoring acts in a supporting role rather than as a Service
Provider for the operational services. In this capacity it can:

Monitor compliance with Royal Mail Group Account’s Audit Policy,

Implement Royal Mail Group Account’s Audit Standards,

Conduct independent reviews of compliance to policy and standards,

Report actual and suspected security incidents, and

Recommend changes, to enhance Royal Mail Group Account’s audit controls, to the
Audit Manager.

6.0 All Personnel Security Awareness

All Royal Mail Group Account service users must be subject to Royal Mail Group Account’s
awareness and/or training programmes. Security aspects are an integral part of these programmes
and should be set in a context appropriate to the user’s role.

Fujitsu Services HORIZON SECURITY POLICY Ref: RS/POL/002
Version: 12.0
COMMERCIAL IN-CONFIDENCE Date: 05/04/2007

All Royal Mail Group Account workers, subcontractors and system users have security
responsibilities and they are required to work together in support of this security policy. Personnel
who may not regard themselves as any kind of “system user” still have security responsibilities. In
particular, they are expected to be vigilant in reporting anything they believe may be suspicious.

Promoting security awareness, throughout Royal Mail Group Account, to subcontractors, and
temporary staff is an important responsibility assigned to Royal Mail Group Account’s Security
Manager. Publicising security reporting and escalation procedures must be part of this awareness
strategy.

6.1 Security Education and Training

eRoyal Mail Group Account’s education and training programme must promote security awareness
through the provision of regular updates, security briefings, explaining the importance and use of
security controls. It should also monitor individual’s security training and ensure appropriate
training is provided for contractors and third parties

7.0 Co-operation between Organisations

Appropriate contacts with law enforcement authorities, regulatory bodies, information service
providers and telecommunications operators must be maintained to ensure that appropriate action
can be quickly taken, and advice obtained, in the event of a security incident. Similarly, membership
of security groups and industry forums should be considered. Exchanges of security information
should be restricted to ensure that confidential information is not passed to unauthorised persons.

8.0 Classification of Information

8.1 Information Control

Information must be classified to indicate the need, priorities, and expected degree of protection
when handling the information. Information has varying degrees of sensitivity and criticality e.g.
financial information or highly confidential information and information often ceases to be sensitive or critical
after a certain period of time, for example, when the information has been made public. Some items may
require an additional level of protection or special handling. An information classification scheme is
used to define an appropriate set of protection levels and communicate the need for special handling
measures. These aspects should be taken into account, as over-classification can lead to the implementation
of unnecessary controls resulting in additional expense.

Royal Mail Group Account (FS) defines agrees and enforces (with relevant parties) procedures for
the exchange of information handled “electronically and by other means”. The procedures used
must comply with FUJITSU legal and contractual requirements and must depend upon the
classification and sensitivity of the information. In particular, the exchange of information, with Post
Office Ltd, must be subject to formally agreed controls based on the classification and sensitivity of
the information transmitted.

8.2 Overview of Policy

Information owners, both Post Office Ltd and FUJITSU staff are required to classify all information
that they own. All information used must be handled in accordance with its classification, as

Contract Controlled Document
FUJ00002046
FUJ00002046

Fujitsu Services HORIZON SECURITY POLICY Ref: RS/POL/002

specified by its owner in line with existing Policy. FS staff can find reference to this on the site
Intranet and Post Office Ltd have their own classification system which is available in the CISP (S1).

8.3 General Principle

The sensitivity of information must be measured by the consequences of a potential security breach
associated with that information. Royal Mail Group Account should assume that aggregation cannot
increase the classification of any information unless risk assessment indicates otherwise.

8.4 FJS Security Classifications

Personal:

This privacy marking applies to matters relating to named individuals where disclosure could render
the company liable to prosecution under privacy legislation such as the UK Data Protection Act.
Staff:

This privacy marking applies to matters relating to staff and their services, where the subject matter

under discussion could apply to a group of staff, and where disclosure or unauthorised access could
lead to commercial embarrassment or staff discontent.

Unclassified:

Unclassified information is that which by its nature can be made publicly available. This is either
because it has no commercial value or its publication would enhance the reputation of the Company.
Declassification is not applicable in this case.

There is no need to mark unclassified material, unless it is believed that there is a need to indicate
that the material is unclassified because others of a similar type are classified.

Where a document contains pages of differing classifications the highest classification must be
marked on the covers.
Eyes Only:

These classifications apply to information and material, the unauthorised disclosure or loss of which
could cause embarrassment or might be detrimental to the interests of all or part of the Company,
but where such impact would not be severe or cause long term damage.

At company level, the following should be used and recognised:
FUJITSU EYES ONLY - Should be available only to employees of Fujitsu and trusted
contractors.

FUJITSU SERVICES EYES ONLY - Should be available only to employees of Fujitsu Services
and trusted contractors.

Qualifications can also be business specific. In such cases these qualifications must be defined by
local policies. The term 'EYES ONLY’, or a consistent translation in the local language, must be
used.

Where a document contains pages of differing classifications the highest classification must be
marked on the covers.

Commercial in Confidence:

This classification applies to information and material, the unauthorised disclosure of which could
cause embarrassment or might be detrimental to the interests of the Company, but which
nevertheless can be shared with third parties if necessary for business purposes.

Where a document contains pages of differing classifications the highest classification must be
marked on the covers.

Company Restricted:

Information whose unauthorised disclosure (even within the organisation) would cause significant
harm to the interests of the organisation. This would normally inflict harm by virtue of financial loss;
loss of profitability or opportunity; embarrassment or loss of reputation.

Documents and material classified COMPANY RESTRICTED should, unless otherwise stated, be
downgraded to FUJITSU EYES ONLY after two years.

Company Secret:

This classification is for information and material of an extremely confidential and sensitive nature, or
of strategic importance, the disclosure of which could cause grave damage to the interests of the
Company.

Documents and material classified COMPANY SECRET must, unless otherwise stated, be
downgraded to FUJITSU EYES ONLY after two years.

All pages must be consecutively numbered to reflect the total number of pages e.g. 1 of 6, 2 of 6 etc.
Copies must be numbered in the same manner i.e. I of 6 copies etc.

A distribution list must be attached showing the copy number of copies sent to each recipient.

8.5 POST OFFICE LTD Classifications

Information security classification

Objective: To ensure that information assets receive an appropriate level of protection.

Horizon information that is generated, processed, communicated or stored within the Horizon
community, either physically or electronically, must be assessed to identify its level of security
classification and determine the protective controls to be applied.

Royal Mail Group’s Information Classification Policy (S4) and associated guidelines must be used
for this purpose. This defines two levels of confidentiality, for which the classification given below
must be used:

e CONFIDENTIAL: Information that has been assessed to be of a sensitive nature and
likely to cause damage following unauthorised disclosure. Personal data (as defined by the
Data Protection Act) is classified as confidential. Personal data includes customer account
numbers and any transaction data associated with them. FAD codes are sometimes used

for authentication purposes and must therefore be treated as confidential. Transaction
records that do not identify a person are confidential on bulk data/reports only.
Transaction receipts for individual transactions do not need to be labelled as
CONFIDENTIAL, since they are intended as a receipt for a transaction by an individual.

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL: Information meeting the classification standards of
government departments, the security services, clients, or assessed to be so sensitive that
unauthorised disclosure would cause acute organisational damage. PIN data and all
encryption keys are interpreted as strictly confidential.

All other information must be classified as INTERNAL unless specifically authorised for release.
See §12.1.3 in RM/POL/002 for INTERNAL information which may need to be released under the
Freedom of Information Act.

All documentation and displayed output from systems containing information classified as
confidential or strictly confidential must carry an appropriate classification label.

There are also legal requirements concerning the release of information — see §12.1 (RM/POL/002)
for more information.

9.0 Asset Management

All major information assets identified must where possible, have an assigned named owner who
must be responsible for ensuring the integrity, availability and confidentiality of the asset. This
should include the provision and maintenance of an asset register and up to date inventories of all
significant component assets — information, software, hardware and services.

9.1Asset Inventory

Information can be held in various forms, and an asset inventory should be maintained for each. All
assets shall be clearly identified and an inventory of all important assets drawn up and maintained.
The inventory should hold the following information:-

The information subject asset name and high level description
The information asset classification,

Special files classification in any subject information

The information subject owner.

The information subject custodian.

9.2 Accountability for Assets

Owners must have sufficient authority and knowledge to allow them to appreciate the value of their
system and or information. They must be responsible for classifying the asset they own, and
therefore ensuring that sufficient protection is being applied and maintained. The protection required
must be commensurate with the value and the risk.

Custodians are appointed by the asset owners to undertake day-to-day tasks and make operational
decisions on behalf of the owner.

9.3 Responsibility & Ownership

A management authorisation process for new information processing facilities must be defined and
implemented.

The following guidelines must be considered for the authorisation process:

a) New facilities must have suitable user management authorisation, authorising their purpose and
use. Authorisation must also be obtained from the manager responsible for maintaining the local
information system security environment to ensure that all relevant security policies and
requirements are met;

b) Where necessary, hardware and software must be checked to ensure that they are compatible with
other system components;

c) The use of personal or privately owned information processing facilities, e.g. laptops, home-
computers or hand-held devices, for processing business information, may introduce new
vulnerabilities and necessary controls must be identified and implemented.

10.0 Personnel Security

Staff concerned with the operations and management of central services within ‘core’ are to be
managed under the guidance of FS Personnel Policy Manual and associated documents.

Staff working on high-risk areas (those IT systems classified as “critical” or information classified as
“sensitive”) are to be subject to more frequent vetting reviews and internal audits. This also applies
to Royal Mail Group Account’s own employees, particularly those staff visiting PO sites and to staff
from subcontractor’s companies. For those staff visiting PO sites there is an enhanced clearance
process detailed in RS/PRO/002 which is managed by Royal Mail Group Account Security staff.

Security awareness must be addressed at the recruitment stage, and referred to in job descriptions,
contracts and monitored during an individual’s employment with the Royal Mail Group Account.
Users must be trained in security procedures and the correct use of information and systems.

Incidents affecting security must be reported through management channels and in accordance with
escalation procedures. All employees and contractors must be made aware of how to report such
incidents. There must be an established formal disciplinary process for dealing with employees who
commit security breaches.

10.1 Job Descriptions, Contracts and Assessment

Royal Mail Group Account must apply best commercial practice, based upon BS ISO/IEC 17799, to
include security considerations within, employee’s terms and conditions for employment, and generic
job descriptions.

10.2 Recruitment Selection

All applicants are subject to an appropriate level of vetting as described in RS/PRO/002 “RMGA
Security Vetting Process”. Criteria for those staff requiring access to Post Office outlets is defined
within RS/PRO/013 “Horizon Security Pass Procedure” and for access to the Horizon network
RS/PRO/003, “Access Control Policy”.

10.3 Confidentiality Agreements

All employment contracts (permanent and temporary) as well as consultant, contractor and supplier
contracts must include clauses governing the treatment of Royal Mail Group Account information
gained as a result of their employment. This may be achieved through signing a non-disclosure
agreement or personal integrity form. Staff must be informed that the use of or removal of, Post
Office information by ex-Royal Mail Group Account staff, gained during their employment with
RMGA, may result in prosecution by the Royal Mail Group Account or the Information
Commissioner.

Contracts must make it clear to employees that they are required to comply with the Information
Security Policy and Standards. Each employment contract must be signed by the employee.

10.4 Management Responsibility

All Managers must ensure that employees, contractors and third party users apply security in
accordance with agreed PO & FS policies and procedures. They must ensure that staff are properly
briefed and comply with the terms and conditions of their employment and both their company’s
information security policy and if working on Horizon this Security Policy.

10.5 Termination Procedures

Procedures must be established to re-define security responsibilities when staff, including contractors
and consultants, are moved within the Royal Mail Group Account or whenever their employment
ceases for any reason or when moving to other parts of Fujitsu.

The access rights of all employees contractors and 3" party users to information and information
processing facilities must be removed upon termination of their employment contract or agreement
or adjusted upon change, including revoking their rights to the system and escorting them from all
Horizon premises.

Where staff move within the Royal Mail Group Account, computer access must be modified or
terminated as appropriate to their change of role.

Any specific security responsibilities of the departing individual must be reviewed and reallocated.

10.5.1 Return of Property
When RMGA staff leave Line managers must have formal procedures in place to ensure the return of
all Royal Mail Group Account property where applicable.

10.5.2 Network Access Removal

Line managers should ensure that individual access, roles, permissions and capabilities to both
physical and information systems are revoked on termination of employment.

10.6 Reporting Security Incidents and breaches

Royal Mail Group Account has established effective procedures for reporting, acting upon and
escalating all security incidents/ breaches that could affect security. It is the responsibility of all users
of the Royal Mail Group Account services and Royal Mail Group Account personnel to use these
procedures.

All security incidents must be reported to the Royal Mail Group Account Security Manager or his
deputy who are responsible for ensuring that all incidents are recorded, investigated and resolved
with appropriate urgency. This should include liaison with Post Office Security staff to review
relevant incidents and actions.

11.0 External Contractors and Suppliers

To maintain the security of the organization’s information and information processing facilities that
are accessed, processed, communicated to, or managed by external parties, the security of Horizon’s
information and information processing facilities should not be reduced by the introduction of
external party products or services. Any access to the Horizon information processing facilities and
processing and communication of information by external parties must be controlled.

Prior to commencement Royal Mail Group Account must ensure that appropriate safeguards cover
the use of external contractors and suppliers, (including agreements on contractual terms and
conditions, checks on the integrity of external contractors) before any work is assigned to them.

Prior to commencement the risks to the Horizon information and information processing facilities
from any business processes involving external parties must be identified and appropriate controls
implemented before granting access. Controls must be agreed, documented and defined in
agreements with any external parties.

External personnel must receive appropriate training and regular updates in organisational policies
and procedures including security requirements, legal responsibilities, business controls and training
in the correct use of information processing facilities.

External personnel must not be allowed access to any classified information without prior written
authority from the information owner and completion of a non-disclosure agreement.

Suppliers of goods and services must be subject to formal agreements in support of this security
policy. Individual agreements with suppliers of standard COTS components are not required.

Evidence of the adequacy of suppliers’ security procedures must be sought where externally supplied
goods or services are used to process sensitive information.

12.0 Physical & Environmental Security
12.1 Policy

To prevent unauthorised access damage and interference to critical or sensitive business information
processing facilities, all business premises housing Horizon assets must be housed in secure areas,
protected by a defined security perimeter with appropriate security barriers and entry controls.

They must be physically protected from unauthorised access damage and interference their
protection must be commensurate with any identified risk. Clear desk and clear screen policies are

required to reduce the risk of unauthorised access or damage to papers media and information
processing facilities.

The selection and design of a secure area must take account of the possibility of damage from fire,
flood, explosion, civil unrest and other forms of natural or man made disasters. Account should also
be taken of relevant health and safety standards. Consideration must be given also to any security
threats presented by neighbouring premises.

12.2 Perimeter Security Measures

The actual measures to be applied must be appropriate to the nature and amount of information, IT
systems and telecommunications facilities at the site. Intrusion detection alarm systems must be used
for installations which are left unattended. These may be connected to a security company or the
Police. Alarm systems must be tested regularly and maintained to manufacturers’ requirements.

Access points must be kept to a minimum and be subject to auditable access control measures.
Emergency exits and other external doors must be fitted with alarms. Security perimeters must be
clearly defined. The perimeter of a building or site containing information processing facilities must
be physically sound (i.e. there must be no gaps in the perimeter or areas where a break in could
easily occur). The external walls of the site must be of solid construction and all external doors must
be suitably protected against unauthorised access e.g. control mechanisms bars, alarms lock etc. A
manned reception area or other means to control physical access to the site or building must be in
place. Access to sites and buildings must be restricted to authorised personnel only. Physical barriers
must if necessary be extended from real floor to real ceiling to prevent unauthorised entry and
environmental contamination such as that caused by fire and flooding. All fire doors on a security
perimeter must be alarmed and must slam shut. Unoccupied secure areas must be physically locked
and subject to periodic checks, and there must be physical protection and guidelines for those staff
working in secure areas.

12.3 Securing Offices Rooms and Facilities

All key facilities must be sited to avoid access by the public. Buildings must be unobtrusive and
give minimum indication of their purpose, with no obvious signs outside or inside the building
identifying the presence of information processing activities.

Support functions and equipment e.g. photocopiers fax machines must be sited appropriately within
the secure area to avoid demands for access which could compromise information.

Doors and windows must be locked when unattended and external protection must be considered for
windows particularly at ground level. Suitable intruder detection systems must be installed to
professional standards and regularly tested to cover all external doors and accessible windows
unoccupied areas should be alarmed at all times cover must be provided for other areas e.g.
computer rooms or communication rooms.

Information processing facilities managed by RMGA must be physically separated from those
managed by third parties. Directories and internal telephone books identifying locations of sensitive
processing facilities must not be readily accessible by the public.

Hazardous or combustible materials must be stored securely at a safe distance from a secure area
Bulk supply such as stationary must not be stored within a secure area until required. Fallback

segregated. Care must be taken to ensure that no single person can perpetrate a security incident by
having an area of single responsibility without this being detected.

17.0

Access Control Policy

The objective is to prevent unauthorised computer and network access. Security facilities at the
operating level must be used to restrict access to computer and network resources. Specific detailed
access controls must be published with the Horizon Access Control Policy (ACP) RS/POL/003.

Access to information, information processing facilities, and business processes must be controlled
on the basis of business and security requirements. Access control rules should take account of
policies for information dissemination and authorisation.

Access control rules and rights for each user or group of users must be clearly stated in an access
control policy. Access controls are both logical and physical and these must be considered

together.

Users and service providers must be given a clear statement of the business

requirements to be met by access controls.

17.2 User Access Management

Formal procedures should be in place to control the allocation of access rights to information
systems and services. The procedures should cover all stages in the life-cycle of user access, from
the initial registration of new users to the final de-registration of users who no longer require access
to information systems and services. Special attention should be given, where appropriate, to the
need to control the allocation of privileged access rights, which allow users to override system
controls.

18.0 Development, Test and Operational Facilities.
To reduce the risk of accidental changes or unauthorised access to operational systems or data:

¢ Development, Test and Operational facilities must be segregated;

e Different logon identities should be used for operational and test systems.

24.0 Change Control Procedures
24.1 Change Control

There must be strict control over the implementation of changes to the software or hardware of any
Royal Mail Group Account system, application or network. Such change control procedures must
ensure that any changes do not compromise any security or control procedure. The Change Control
Policy will mandate the course of action required for hardware, network, system and application
changes. Such change control procedures must ensure that any changes do not compromise any
security or control procedure. Change control procedures must ensure:

The identification of all components affected by the change.

The authorisation of all changes and their approval on completion.

The control of software versions at each stage.

Quality and content control.

The maintenance of a full record of all changes (audit trail)

The deletion of any temporary User IDs/passwords, data and linkages when the
system becomes live.

Changes only carry out their required function and nothing more.

e Only those changes that have been tested are implemented on the live system.
e Changes meet operational requirements.

24.2 Operational Changes

Change controls procedures must exist which permit the controlled correction of live systems in
order to meet operational requirements and emergencies, e.g. patching of system vulnerabilities. All
such changes must be reviewed and approved by the appropriate line management as soon as
possible. All Operational and emergency changes should be reviewed following implementation and
either removed from the live environment or consolidated via the normal change control and build
procedures.

24.3 Operating System Changes

Prior to any operating system upgrade or change, a review of all application control and integrity
procedures must be carried out to ensure that they cannot be compromised by the proposed changes.

25.0 Vulnerability Management Policy

All computer systems and networks contain vulnerabilities which can be exploited by hackers,
crackers and insider’s intent on doing harm. The vulnerabilities may be as a result of:

Software defects requiring vendor issued patches or fixes
Insecure accounts with weak or nonexistent passwords
Unnecessary services such as, Telnet or remote access
Built In weaknesses, such as backdoors accounts.
System miss-configuration

FUJ00002046

Fujitsu Services HORIZON SECURITY POLICY Ref: RS/POL/002
Version: 12.0
COMMERCIAL IN-CONFIDENCE Date: 05/04/2007

These vulnerabilities can be exploited even when anti virus, firewalls and intrusion detection systems
are in place and the only way to properly secure a system is to first assess the existing vulnerabilities
on each machine or network segment, determine the degree of risk for each vulnerability, and then
mitigate - or fix - the vulnerabilities by updating hardware and software versions or applying vendor
issued service packs, hot fixes and patches. This process of finding, evaluating and mitigation is
known as vulnerability management.

Royal Mail Group Account must adopt industry standard best practise and BS ISO/IEC 17799: 2005
recommendations by implementing vulnerability management.

26.0 Malicious Software Control Policy

Software and information processing facilities are vulnerable to the introduction of malicious
software, such as computer viruses, network worms, Trojan horses and logic bombs. All Royal Mail
Group Account users must be made aware of the dangers of unauthorized or malicious software, and
controls including the protection, based on the Computer Virus Policy RS/POL/04. Managers must
where appropriate introduce controls to prevent, detect and remove malicious code and control
mobile code (this applies to all workers and networks connecting to the Horizon network.)

There must be effective security awareness, appropriate system access and change management
controls as well as the installation and regular update of anti-virus detection and repair software.
However, it is essential that appropriate management procedures and business continuity plans for
recovering from virus attacks, including all necessary data and software back-up and recovery
arrangements are available in accordance with section.

Precautions are required to prevent and detect the introduction of malicious code and unauthorised
mobile code.

The AV security Policy must provide protection from unauthorised access from any utility operating
system software and malicious software that is capable of overriding or bypassing system or
application controls. Procedures against malicious software must be in place and kept up to date.

27.0 Control of Proprietary Software
Royal Mail Group Account uses proprietary software within the terms of the licence conditions.
Unauthorised copying of software and documentation is prohibited.

contingency plans encompass:

e Handling emergency situations,
e Operating in fall-back mode, and
e Recovery (or Business Resumption) to full operational status.

28.2 Testing Contingency Plans

All contingency plans are tested on a regular basis under representative operational conditions.

28.3 Subcontractor’s Contingency Plans

Contingency arrangements are examined and managed to ensure that risks are minimised, wherever
Royal Mail Group Account is dependent upon subcontractors (or third parties), for essential services
or supplies.

29.0 Compliance

Royal Mail Group Account is required to comply with legislative requirements and commercial
standards.

29.1 Compliance with RMGA Security Policy

Compliance with the requirements defined in this Security Policy is mandatory. The policy is to be
applied throughout Royal Mail Group Account for the secure management and operation of the
services.

Periodic reviews are carried out at least annually, under the direction of Royal Mail Group
Account’s line managers, to verify that Royal Mail Group Account is operating in accordance with
its security policy and procedures.

Royal Mail Group Account’s Audit function (see section 5) provides the essential monitoring
activities needed to provide senior management with visibility that Royal Mail Group Account is
operating in accordance with this policy.

These may be carried out by the Security Manager, the programme Assurance Manager or External
companies who have a statutory right of access to information.

29.2 Independent Information Security Reviews

All areas of information security should be subject to regular reviews to ensure compliance with
security policy control objectives, controls, policies, processes and procedures for information
security. They should be independently reviewed annually or when significant changes to the
security implementation occur.

29.3 Compliance with Legislative Requirements
Royal Mail Group Account must ensure compliance with all legislative requirements, including the:

Computer Misuse Act (1990)

Data Protection Act (1998),

Freedom of Information Act 2000

Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (2000)
Financial Services and Markets Act 2000
Money Laundering Regulations (2003), and
Copyright, Designs and Patents Act (1988).

All applications handling personal data on individuals must comply with data protection legislation
and principles. Royal Mail Group Account shall process personal data only in accordance with the
instructions of each Data Controller as set out in the Codified Agreement and applicable provisions
of the Service Definition Schedules dealing with such processing.

The security features, capabilities and related procedures provided in respect of the Network
Banking must be compliant with the requirements of Part 3 of the Regulation of Investigatory
Powers Act 2000.

Under the Computer Misuse Act, it is an offence to access or modify material without proper
authority, or to access material with intent to commit further offences. Warning notices to this effect
must be displayed to potential users prior to system log-on.

Royal Mail Group Account must protect against unauthorised copying of documentation and
software.

In addition to the Acts identified above, Royal Mail Group Account must comply with appropriate
sections of PACE, Post Office and Telegraph Acts, Official Secrets Act 1989, Companies Act and
relevant EU Directives.

29.4 Technical Compliance Checking

Information systems should be regularly checked for compliance with security implementation
standards. Technical compliance checking involves the examination of operational systems to ensure
that hardware and software controls have been correctly implemented. This type of compliance
checking requires specialist technical assistance. It should be performed manually (supported by
appropriate software tools, if necessary) by an experienced system engineer, or by an automated
software package which generates a technical report for subsequent interpretation by a technical
specialist.

Compliance checking also covers, for example, penetration testing, which might be carried out by
independent experts specifically contracted for this purpose. This can be useful in detecting
vulnerabilities in the system and for checking how effective the controls are in preventing
unauthorized access due to these vulnerabilities. Caution should be exercised in case success of a
penetration test could lead to a compromise of the security of the system and inadvertently exploit
other vulnerabilities.

Any technical compliance check should only be carried out by, or under the supervision of,
competent, persons authorised by the Royal Mail Group Account Security Manager.
