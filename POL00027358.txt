Risk Update

1. Purpose
The purpose of this paper is:

11 To present the Executive Summary of the PwC diagnostic review on risk and
change management (20 minutes).

1.2 To present and agree the proposed next steps for developing the risk appetite
statement (10 minutes).

1.3 Note the progress that has been made towards developing a narrative for the
discussions scheduled to take place at the October Board meeting on the Kelly report
(20 minutes).

2. Activities / Updates

2.1 PwC Report: As previously discussed at various ExCo meetings, PwC have now
completed a diagnostic review of both risk and change management (terms of
reference are attached as Appendix - A.1). An early draft report was submitted
late last week (a delay to the original timetable) and we are expecting it to be
finalised over the next 10 days. Pending finalisation, however, we thought it
sensible to distribute the Executive Summary in order to give directional sense of
their findings. This is attached as Appendix - A.2. The report recognises that the
current arrangements are suitable for the stable state, however, given the Post
Office’s change mandate, a number of enhancements will be required including
capability building at all levels. The risk team will present the report and
accompanying action plans once the report has been finalised.

2.2 Risk Appetite: Attached is a short paper presenting a suggested action plan for
determining Post Office’s risk appetite (please refer to Appendix - B). The
reason for bringing this paper to the ExCo at this stage is to confirm ownership
of the risk categories listed in the table on page 1 of Appendix — B. Once agreed,
the Risk team will be in touch to arrange meetings with each of the owners.

2.3 Kelly Report: You will recall that at the Board meeting in July, discussions were
held on the Kelly Report. Subsequent to that meeting it was agreed that the CEO
will provide an assessment of the risks and work undertaken/planned on actions
resulting from the Kelly Report. A narrative is being worked on with Chris Aujard,
Neil Hayward and Gavin Lambert to support CEO’s discussion with the Board
and this will be distributed in the meeting for discussion.

Executive Summary

The Maturity Journey

All organisations evolve and mature over time. POL is a new organisation, having
recently separated from RMG, and to that extent it is still warking to establish a
clear identity and purpose. It is not surprising therefore to find that it is taking time
for POL to develop the appropriate chocks and balances needed to manage risk or
indeed the change lifecycle and assurance gates to ensure the effective management
of more complex change. Historically POL has a good track record of delivering
individual programmes and has managed both ‘run’ the business while ‘changing’
the business.

POL has not been complacent and there is a good level of awareness of the need to.
mature as POL ups its ambitions, with a number of steps already taken to appoint
key personnel, review and strengthen governance structures and processes. This
review is an example of that awareness and intention to build out and mature over
time.

In many ways, in steady state, the current arrangements would broadly suffice —
although we have been able to make a number of, hopefully helpful, suggestions to
target and expedite further improvement. However, given the POL change
mandate, which we have assumed to be fairly radical, the delta between where POL,
is and where it needs to be is even bigger, This report establishes the ‘as is’ baseline
and makes recommendations which POL need to action in order to accelerate the
improvements to risk and change management needed to support business
transformation to deliver the 2020 Strategy and associated transformation plans.

‘The Strategic Areas Where Focus is Required

Based on our assessment there are a number of inter-related areas where POL
needs to apply strategic focus to accelerate is level of maturity.

APPENDIX - A

Culture and behaviours: If POL is still finding its identity, it is not
surprising to find that POL is still working to establish a clear culture and
norms. There isn't yet a clear ‘POL way’ of doing things. Investment of time,
particularly with the senior leaders in the organisation is needed to work this
through, if they are to provide a strong and consistent narrative throughout the
POL transformation journey.

Governance: Although the Board and commnittee structure is fit for purpose,
there is a lack of clarity around roles and responsibilities which undermines the
ability for the governance structures to effectively operate. For example, we
found little evidence of colleagues holding one another to account.

Working in a complex transformation environment: requires a stable
culture, agreed norms, clear accountabilities and indeed a governance structure
that supports decision making, It also requires senior leaders to do the right
thing, work in a matrix stracture and deliver the strategic agenda over and
above their functional responsibilities. Addressing the two previous points
would reduce the risks posed in relation to business transformation.

Equipped for Business Transformation: POL has the systems and
processes in place to manage small scale change and risk within individual
functions. It needs to equip itself with the vision, culturs, processes, people and
systems to deal with complexity and stress the organisation will undertake as
part of Business Transformation. As part of our recommendations we have

identified the need for POL to:

+ Better define its risk appetite and the common framework as to how it will
manage risk across the organisation

+ Consolidate and simplify its change activity to reduce the number of
moving parts

+ Equip itself with the right tools and processes including a common change
language, the improvement in Management Information and upsbilling of
its ehange capability with the experience of undertaking transformational
change.

DEVELOPING RISK APPETITE: NEXT STEPS

1. BACKGROUND:

POL00027358

POL00027358

APPENDIX - B

This paper sets out the next steps required to progress to a Board level statement of risk

appetite for the Post Office. To date, two papers on risk appetite have been discussed by ExCo; a

paper at the ExCo risk session on 8 May 2014 and the risk appetite framework and journey

presentation prepared by PwC and presented on 11 August 2014.

It is generally accepted that setting risk appetite is not a “right first time” exercise. Increased

accuracy over setting appetite is gained iteratively.

2. ACTION PLAN:

The next steps in the process to develop a proposed Risk Appetite Statement for the Audit and

Risk Committee and the Post Office Board are:

¢ Risk and Compliance have identified proposed categories of risk which will be included in the

risk appetite statement. These categories and the business unit owners are:

POL00027358

e Risk team will engage with risk category owners and subject matter experts to facilitate a
structured discussion to agree risk appetite statement in areas where there is appetite for
taking risks.

3. The proposed risk appetite statement will be presented to the Audit and Risk Committee on 15
October 2014 (date to be confirmed) and to the Post Office Board at its meeting on 29 October
2014.

4. Following ratification of the proposal by the Board, Risk and Compliance will work with risk
category owners on implementation of the risk appetite statements into business areas. This will
include developing local metrics and tolerance levels for each category of risk.

ACTION REQUESTED:
ExCo are requested to confirm their agreement with the next steps, risk categories above and the

owners allocated.

SLT event planning — 3 October 2014

Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to:

11 update ExCo on plans for the next SLT event on 3 October.

Background

2.1 The last SLT event was held in early July at King’s Place. Presentations were
delivered on business performance, marketing and business transformation, with a
market stall approach for sessions on mails, financial services, digital and business
transformation. The day was rounded off with a session on leadership and
development.

2.2 The event on 3 October will be held at one of the ETC venues, close to Museum of
London.

2.3 It forms a key element of the communications strategy which is setting out the
compelling case for change, building on earlier events, Team Talk Live, on-going
communications tactics (blogs, Team Talk lite etc...) and provides a key opportunity
to update colleagues and further harness their support.

Proposal

3.1 The proposal for the 3 October meeting is to broadly follow the same format as in
July, with a business update in the morning sessions followed by afternoon sessions
on leading through change. This latter session is aimed at providing SLT with the
opportunity to reflect on the change journey so far and their requirements as leaders
over the coming months.

3.2 It is essential that we use the meeting both to report back on developments since we
last met, with specific reference to the accelerators, but also to keep up the
momentum on the change narrative, emphasising the leadership responsibility of all
on SLT during the months ahead.

3.3 SLT will also have been updated on cost reduction initiatives in a teleconference
early in September.

3.4 The objectives of the 3 October session are therefore:
e To continue the leadership dialogue around the accelerated strategy and in year

performance: ensuring that SLT has the information it needs to update teams,
and understands its role

SLT event planning Mark Davies Page 1 of 2
5 September 2014
POL00027358
POL00027358

e To continue the leadership development journey into leading the transformation
of the Post Office: including the opportunity to provide personal development
opportunities

¢ To build on the development journey which began with Hay Group and the SLT
away day sessions earlier this year

3.5. The proposed format is therefore:

Morning Sessions — Transformation Update
(Plenary sessions or SLT cohort groups)

Keynote speech — Paula Vennells

Business Performance Update — Chris Day/Sarah Hall

Transformation update (including Wave 1 staff cost changes) David Ryan/team
Network/Mails strategy update: Martin George/Kevin Gilliland/team

Financial Services strategy: Nick Kennett/team

eoeeee

Afternoon Sessions - Focus on change leadership
(Break out into SLT cohort groups (x3) with Hay facilitators)

Introduction: Neil Hayward/team

The role of leadership through major change

How to lead change whilst dealing with personal transition

The difference between true sponsorship and being a “champion” (sponsorship
is action not position)

e What we know of our collective and personal leadership styles — how will this
help us, how will this hinder us? What are we going to do about it?

4. Recommendations
ExCo is asked to:

41 note the proposals set out above and agree the over-arching format of the event,
subject to further updates.

Winning in Mails and Network Extension Update

1. Purpose

The purpose of this paper is to:

1.1.

Update the Executive Committee (ExCo) on latest developments in Mails and
Network Extension.

2. Background

2.1.

2.2.

2.3.

2.4.

2.5.

2.6.

At the June Board we presented our plans to win in the Mails market and extend our
network by an additional 10,000 to 20,000 Access Points.

The threats we face in the Mails market from the likes of Collect+ and myHermes
continue to grow. Collect+ posted its first year of profit (£1.8 million) for the 52 weeks
ending March 2014, with record full year revenues of £34.1 million on a volume of
13.6 million parcels. Collect+’s parcel volumes have continued to grow in the first
quarter of 2014/15, with an additional 1.2m parcels reported on the same-period last
year. If Collect+ continues to grow at last year’s growth rates for the next three years,
it will have profitable revenue of £240m and handle 74m items per annum.

Year-to-date Mails income is down (at Period 5) by £800k (0.6%) on last year and
down by £10m (7%) on target, this pressure highlights the need to transform the
mails business at pace.

However, some competitors are struggling in this highly competitive market. Local
Letterbox, a parcels collections, returns and sending start-up which was due to open
500 parcelpods across the UK in 2014, has ceased trading.

We believe that this market has significant opportunity for Post Office Ltd (POL). We
hold a significant share of the retail Mails market (>90%) and the parcels, collections
and returns markets are growing.

In the three months since the June Board we have already made good progress with
a number of actions to deliver on our ambition to win in mails and extend our
network. This paper will update you on the key developments.

3. Key Points

3.1.

While we have been engaging closely with Royal Mail Group (RMG) about our plans,
and they have committed resource to help, we have not yet reached strategic
alignment which will ensure that we can deliver our Mails strategy. Failure to reach
alignment with RMG would negate much of the progress that is highlighted in this
paper and the supporting reading. The team is currently working on a detailed set of
timescales and deliverables which highlight the critical path that demonstrates when
these agreements will need to be achieved.

3.2. We have identified simplified journeys for our key mail products. So far we have
agreed with RMG to waive constraints for Access Point trials, such as not having to
weigh Home Shopping Returns.

3.3. Ivy trials have begun. We are on track to launch 177 pilots by the end of September
involving retailers such as SPAR and OneStop, with two sites already live.

Activities/Current Situation

4.1. In the June Board update we highlighted several areas that are key to winning in
Mails:

Align Relationship with RMG.

Large-scale Network Development.

Product Simplification and Rationalisation.
Capturing Mails eCommerce.

Becoming the Leading SME Service Provider.
Sales Efficiency.

eoeoeceee

Below is a brief update on developments in each of these key areas. More
detail is provided in the supporting slide pack (‘Winning in Mails and Network
Development Update’) to be found in the Reading Room.

4.2. Align Relationship with RMG:

. RMG remains integral to our plans for both Mails and Network
Development, fully aligning our relationship is critical to our success
across all areas.

. A joint plan has been developed with RMG. A joint POL and RMG
Trading Board meets weekly to discuss progress and agree actions to
deliver on this plan.

. Work has been split into five areas: Branch Metrics and Market
Trends; Improving the Customer Journey and Providing the Right
Products; Network Footprint; Pricing Strategy and Commercial
Alignment; and Marketing Levers.

° We have already gained agreement on a new size for Small Parcels
which combines the two current Small Parcel size limits. This is due to
go live 20 October 2014.

. We also have agreement to waive some of RMG’s requirements
(weighing, CRB checks) at trial access points offering Home Shopping
Returns.

. Our main objective for the next few months is to align our commercial

relationship. At the moment there is some mis-alignment of incentives.
For example, overall RMG is incentivised by revenue, whilst we are
incentivised by volume as we receive a per product fixed fee, not a %
of revenue.

. Over the coming few months we will work with RMG to align our
objectives.

4.3. Large-scale Network Development

DRAFT
Winning in Mails and Network Development Update I Martin George and Kevin Gilliland
September 2014 I Page 2 of 4
POL00027358

POL00027358
Strictly Confidential — Draft
. We have made significant progress with our ambition to grow our
network by ~10k — 20k access points.
. We have set-up a cross-functional team (including RMG colleagues)

with a clear mandate to deliver product simplification, retailer
partnerships, engagement with stakeholders and viable technology
solutions that will facilitate the extension of the network on commercial
terms that is required for POL to win in Mails.

. Project Ivy has gathered considerable pace and is being shaped to
test and learn for the broader network development.
. We have two trial sites live and commitment from retailers for a further

177 sites across the UK, by the end of September. These retailers
include One Stop, SPAR and Eurogarages.

. We are in detailed conversations with a number of major national
multiple retailers. We have a sales strategy which prioritises retailers
based on a set of criteria including network size and revenues,
increase in coverage, and potential for cannibalisation. With a view to
launching whole-estate partnerships for future POL access points. For
more specific detail refer to ‘Winning in Mails and Network
Development Update’ to be found in the Reading Room.

. In parallel customer research is underway to ensure the access point
propositions meet the needs of key customer groups, in respect of:
product offering, channel, location, existing missions based on
lifestyles, potential host partners and opening hours. The qualitative
phase is now complete (and validates the initial products for
simplification). The quantitative phase (a nationally representative
survey of 5,000), will be complete in October 2014.

4.4. Product Simplification

. The objective is to simplify product journeys for both the customer and
the operator. This will make our proposition more attractive to the
operator and customer in an increasingly competitive market.

. We have identified the first phase of products for simplification; core
Collections and Returns services (Home Shopping Returns and Click
and Collect), alongside core sending services (1°' and 2" Class labels,
Signed For and Special Delivery by 1pm, bought online via Click &
Drop).

. We are working with RMG to develop a prototype to showcase these
new customer and operator journeys on the latest low-cost, portable,
minimal footprint hardware.

. The prototype will not only show the new product journeys but will also
link into back-end systems e.g. financial reconciliation and RMG’s
track and trace.

° This prototype will be available at the end of September 2014, but will
require technical and user testing before it can be deployed in a live
environment.

° The next stage will be to work with RMG to radically simplify customer

and operator journeys. This depends upon RMG removing significant
long-standing requirements, such as weighing items.

4.5. Capturing Mails eCommerce
. We have launched a Returns service with eBay which is expected to

generate ~£7.6m in income this financial year and will launch a Click &
Collect service with Amazon in September.

. Our ambition is to become the one-stop shop for e-commerce buyers
and sellers, along each stage of the journey — from ordering, fulfilment,
payment, financial services, collections and returns.

. We have commenced integration with Metapack to allow for more
rapid engagement with RMG and collaboration in the Click & Collect
market.

4.6. Becoming the leading SME service provider

. Please refer to ‘SME Proposition Strategy Update’ paper, in the
Reading Room.

4.7. Sales Efficiency

. We have launched an unprecedented training and engagement
programme with our frontline that has seen Mails income increase by
T%.

. It involves up-skilling our agents and Crown managers in Mails sales

coaching capability. This began in July 2014 and so far we have
engaged over 500 branches. On the back of this success there is a
plan in place to speed-up the roll out.

5. Conclusion

5.1. Many of the actions we have outlined (such as Network Development and product
simplification) are medium-term plays that will help to grow and safeguard business
through the current plan period. As such we would not expect to feel the benefit of
these changes in the current year.

5.2. The NPV on Network Development is positive (£2-3m). Beyond the direct benefits
associated with capturing an additional £86m in revenue, Network Development will
enable faster roll out of Product Simplification and shift to lower cost Locals Light
Channel (benefits estimated to exceed £100m)

LARGE SCALE NETWORK DEVELOPMENT: OPERATING MODELS

Basic Mails Plus is the primary operating model that will support
Network Development

DESCRIPTION

+ Acceptance only model for sending and collection of parcels, alongside bill pay and eTop-up

+ Customer processes mails transaction online before dropping parcel(s) off at access point

+ Access point simply scans the barcode, issues CoP and stores parcel for RMG collection

+ Bill pay and eTop-up allow significant scope for market share growth and allow retailers to consider
moving to Post Office from competitors

PRODUCTS KEY ELEMENTS KEY OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS

A saree

+ Acceptance only for mails: * Technological solution + Collections
— 18/2"4 class (with signed — Simple and low cost (one-off and on-going) — RMG to collect
for add-on) — Low training requirement — Most likely new access points will already
— Home Shopping Returns — Small in-store footprint; could be ePOS integrated be on existing collection routes
— Click and collect — Easy to update software and open source + Segregation
— Tracked product (possibly — Minimum infrastructure requirements — No segregation at point of acceptance
special delivery but may — Label printed in store (preliminary customer research — Segregation performed by RMG post-
not need time element suggests this could be a USP) collection
with fixed pick-up time) — Low operational requirements + Revenue protection
— International (Airmail) — Retailer cash with direct reconciliation — No weighing or sizing performed at access
— ePOS integration available for suitable major partners point
* Essential non-mails services: + Agent pay — RMG to perform spot checks at mail plants
bill pay and eTop-up — Fully variable * Cash
— Fair market rate — No cash required for mails as payment is
— Simple blended flat rate taken online
— POL should keep a higher percentage of retained margin — Retailer cash for eTop-up and bill pay

relative to locals
+ Product set to be competitive
* Short in-store counter transaction time

Competitors are seen as a more convenient
alternative to Post Office, providing quick drop off,
longer opening hours and online payment

For those using competitors — now not seen as an
additional benefit (almost expected)

Likely to become a basic requirement for most

Expectation that tracking sophistication will increase
overtime (e.g. apps, real-time) and become
commoditised

Although not used by all, for those sending parcels of
value provides re-assurance

Offered as standard by some competitors

Royal Mail/Post Office prices seen as prohibitive for
anything outside of a small, light parcel vs. the
competition

Competitors seen as cheaper than PO for higher
weight steps (and sizes), with straightforward pricing
(especially among SMEs)

Technology risk: requirement to integrate CDP and Track & Trace leads to delays implementation of product journeys beyord 1st and 2nd class postage,

impacting commercial viability of tablet solution h phase 1. This risk is controlled

+ Stakeholder risk: fundamental misalignment of RMG and POL commercial interests, and / or lack of engagement leads to ddays in radical simplification of mails
products (e.g. remove obligations to weigh and sizeitems in access points), resulting in delays to cbsing deals with retailers and lower than expected aistomer
demand, with a knock on impact on ND roll out and pofitability. This risk has inadequate control

+ Stakeholder risk: lack of RMG and POL agreement on ownership of the font end customer journey leads to lack of agreemert on POL’s Click & Drop as the

online customer channel for POL, resulting in the need to redesign processes built in phase 1 of prodtct simplification (these currently assume Click & Drop as the

channel for purchasing 1st, 2nd Class and Special cblivery), and hence, delays in the programme. The isk is inadequately controlled

significant investment
costs in capex, software
development, programme

Payback period is
therefore 4 to 5 years,
which is longer than

POST OFFICE LTD BOARD

SME Proposition Strategy Update

1. Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to:

11 Update the Board on progress since June.

1.2 Provide timelines for delivery and content for November Board.
2. Background

2.1 Post Office has an estimated 2 million (40% of total market) SME’s visiting the
branch network on a weekly basis and this customer group contributes 15% of
total revenue.

2.2 SME revenue is primarily driven through mails services, though limited customer
data is held due to a limited number of these customers registering for Drop &
Go.

2.3 Other products and services are available for SME’s but have not historically
been launched based on customer/market need. As a result, Post Office does
not have a cohesive and relevant proposition for this market and are is not
currently seen as a credible business services provider.

24 Given the size of opportunity and scope that Post Office has to win in this
market, a project was started in May consisting of four phases and follows a
proven and highly iterative framework to confidently deliver a proposition set;
firmly based on customer need, market opportunity, internal/partner capability
and commercial value.

2.5 In June we presented to the Board a hypothesis for our SME strategy based on
early stage insight along with the forecast commercial value for this segment
from 2014 - 2020.

3. Activities/Current Situation

3.1 The process we are following is highly iterative, keeping the customer at the
heart of our development. Below is a summary of the four phases of the project,
associated timings and what has been completed to date -

3.2 Phase 1 (complete) — the aim of this phase is to segment the SME market and
understand who our target market is, gather customer and market insight and
identify prioritised opportunities for the Post Office. Outputs of this phase are
detailed below and within the attached executive summary deck:

« We will be targeting micro businesses (<10 employees)

e Specifically focus on start-up, lifestyle and growth segments, with a
particular focus on the e-commerce vertical

SME Strategy Update Martin George September 2014 Page 1 of 3
POL00027358
POL00027358

Confidential

e High level insight told us that SME’s do not see the Post Office as a
credible business service provider and that we must focus on getting our
core mails offering fit for purpose before being considered for wider
products and services, meaning that pricing, engagement, acquisition
and servicing in mails must be the focus for 2014/15

e This will give us the platform and portfolio of customers to credibly deliver
a Financial Services proposition to the market

e Based on depth interviews with SME’s, market opportunity and internal
ideation, Mails and Financial Services were the areas prioritised

3.3 Phase 2 — The aim of this phase is to deep dive on the opportunity areas (mails
and FS), validating them from a customer and commercial perspective and
identifying concepts that can be tested with customers. Components of this
phase are detailed below:

Deep dive customer research on mails and FS with over 30 SME’s
Proposition co-creation sessions with over 20 SME’s

Identify commercial opportunity for each area

Generate ideas and testing with customers to inform proposition design
Completion date - 12"" September

3.4 Phase 3 — this phase will explore the concepts identified further, to design the
proposition features and benefits, define the customer experience and build a
business case. Outputs of this phase are detailed below:

e Stretch and build initial concepts and convert them to a detailed
proposition set in collaboration with Bank of Ireland and Royal Mail

e Bring the proposition to life through customer experience design

e Deliver a working prototype of the propositions using a combination of
visual storyboards, clickable wireframes and collateral mock ups to test
with customers

e Identify commercial implications and capability gaps (internally and
partners)

e Build a business case and identify cost drivers

¢ Completion date - 3 October

4.5 Phase 4 — this phase will build a more detailed prototype to validate with
customers, produce a detailed go to market plan and detailed business case
outlining investment requirements. Outputs of this phase are detailed below:

Identification of minimal viable proposition and detailed roll out plan

Go to market plan and implementation roadmap

Defined customer marketing, channel and distribution strategies

Fully functioning prototypes for the user experience and user interface
which will be fully tested and enhanced through multiple rounds of
customer testing in collaboration with Bank of Ireland and Royal Mail

e 5year commercial case, including investment requirements

e Project completion date — 31° October

Commercial Impact/Costs
5.1 £95,600 already spent for delivery of first phase.

5.2 A contribution of £95,600 from Eagle funding (Bank of Ireland) has been
approved and budgeted for.

5.3 A further £222,800 is required to complete this project.
5.4 The proposition framework used for this project will be embedded into the Post
Office, removing the need to work with an external consultancy firm on future

proposition development and any associated costs.

5.5 Detailed commercial impact and development costs will be determined through
the process and will form part of the final output.

Key Risks/Mitigation
6.1 To be determined through the process and detailed in final output.
Recommendations & Next Steps

7.1 The SME proposition strategy work will be presented at the November Board
session for final approval.

7.2 The presentation in November will clearly articulate the SME proposition
strategy, the 5 year commercial impact, risks and dependencies, go to market
plan, delivery roadmap and fully functioning prototypes to bring the propositions
to life.

Corporate Insurance Programme 2014/15

1. Purpose

The purpose of this paper is to:

1.1. Share the output of a review of the insurance position and recommend the basis
for insurance renewal for the period 1 October 2014 to 30 September 2015; and

1.2. Update on the appointment of an in-house insurance and risk management
professional to manage the insurance programme, in light of the current cost
reduction programme.

2. Background

2.1. This is the third anniversary of the PO stand-alone Insurance Programme
following the split from the RMG insurance programme in September 2012.

2.2 PO has worked with insurers on the largest risks (Crime, General Liability and
Motor) in order to keep Insurance costs to a minimum whilst enjoying appropriate
cover to meet our risks.

2.3 An insurance review has been commissioned to ensure that key risks are insured
and to identify whether any enhancements to cover or premium savings can be
achieved now we have improved risk and claims information.

2.4. PO has had no major claims in the last 24 months. This has enabled us to be
more proactive with Insurers over pricing and coverage.

2.5 PO has built up discrete claims data over the past two years. Historically this
was an issue because it was not possible to separate PO from RM’s data.

3. Key Insurance policies

3.1. The key corporate insurances currently in place are (more detail at Annex 3):
« Crime
e Directors and Officers Liability
e Property Damage/Increased Cost of Working
° Terrorism
«¢ Employers Liability
e Public Liability
«¢ Motor Fleet (Commercial and Private)

e Cyber Liability (specific Government Contracts only)
e Professional Indemnity (Government Contracts only)
« Personal Accident/Travel
e Special Contingency

4. Claims

4.1 This has been the second strong year for PO with regards to claims, with far
fewer claims notified than envisaged in the last 12 months.

Corporate Insurance Chris Day Page 1 of 8

Programme September 2014
POL00027358
POL00027358

Strictly Confidential

4.2 It should be noted that PO now has clear claims procedures in place, with QBE
handling all liability and motor claims. This has led to a substantial drop in
amounts paid out in claims since RMG managed the process. Full details are
attached in Annex 2.

5. Summary of Insurance Review

5.1 A review has been undertaken of all the major risks and relevant insurance
policies. Full details are contained in Appendix 1, however in summary, the main
findings of the review are:

Our insurances are fit for purpose

Some policies will not be renewed (Contractors All Risks)

Looking at reducing deductibles where there is no impact on premium
Leveraging our risk and claims data to reduce premium where possible

We are obtaining quotations for Professional Indemnity Insurance across POL

eee ee

5.2 The review will be updated to reflect the findings of the PWC report.
6. “In-House” Insurance Resource

6.1 As our risk profile changes and as we execute our strategy, it is important that,
where possible, our insurances are aligned to our risks. Whilst our Insurance
advisers and insurers provide support to us with our day to day requirements,
consideration has been given to investing in a full time “in house” Risk and
Insurance manager.

6.2 This post would enable us to constantly review our insurable and non-insurable
exposures and also manage our external insurance partner relationships.
Alongside this, we would be able to align our risk financing strategy to our
internal risk register (where given the confidential and sensitive nature of the
detail, this should remain internal) together with meeting our corporate
governance responsibilities.

6.3 This role is in line with comparable companies of PO size and complexity. A
strong candidate has been identified but as the cost would be c.£100k pa it is
recommended that this decision is incorporated within Business Transformation.

7. Recommendation

The Board is asked to agree:

7.1 Renewal of insurance policies as set out in Annex 1.

7.2 Future renewal authority is delegated to Chris Day.

7.3 That the decision of recruiting dedicated insurance resource is incorporated

within Business Transformation.

APPENDIX 3
Brief synopsis of Insurance cover

1. Crime Insurance

1.1. PO historically has one of the largest stand-alone Crime policies in the UK
insurance market, insuring to a limit of GBP600 million, and is a requirement for
membership of the Bank of England’s Note Circulation Scheme. The policy
covers all risk of crime including theft by employees. The policy carries a
GBP1million excess and is insured by QBE and others. This is PO's largest
external premium spend. Following a review with Supply Chain, we are able to
reduce this limit to GBP400million for the forthcoming year saving a potential 5%
of premium.

2. Property Damage/Increased Cost of Working/Terrorism.

2.1 PO has a Property Damage policy, insuring the full value of properties valued at
above GBP1m. There is a GBP10 million increased cost of working limit. There
have been no claims.

2.2 Zurich is the insurer and there is a GBP1million excess on the policy. Pool Re
insures the Terrorism which mirrors the Property Damage policy.

2.3. We have obtained alternative quotations from several Insurers, the most
proactive being Travelers who spent a day at PO Swindon and subsequently
offered wider coverage, a training programme for PO staff at our insured sites
and a saving of 15% over the original 2013 premium. Our existing insurers
Zurich have subsequently offered a 11% rebate to reflect the risk improvement
activity at Swindon to close the premium gap. We are anticipating a further 6%
reduction at renewal. We are also looking at whether we are able to reduce the
GBP1m deductible without cost and introduce an aggregate limit to cap PO
exposure.

3. Combined Liability Insurance (Employers/Public Liability)

3.1. PO has a combined Liability programme from QBE, providing GBP50m of
coverage on both Employers Liability and Public Liability. This carries a
GBP250k excess. QBE handle the claims below the excess and is reimbursed by
PO on a quarterly basis. This is a relationship that works well.

4. Motor Fleet Insurance

4.1. PO has two motor fleets (Commercial vehicles and Private Cars) both insured via
QBE.

4.2 The policy is placed in the same way as the Combined liability (namely, with a
GBP250k excess with claims below the excess paid by QBE and reimbursed by
PO on a quarterly basis).

5. Directors and Officers Liability

5.1 This policy provides full cover for PO directors and officers where they are sued
as a result of a wrongful act, resulting from something that they are alleged to
have done while acting as a manager of PO.

5.2 In addition, the policy will respond if there is an investigation into an act that they
are alleged to have committed.

5.3 The policy currently has a limit of GBP60m. The insurance review looked at
whether reducing this limit to GBP40m (saving approx. GBP20,000 in premium)
was viable. As a large organisation, it is felt that the current limit of GBP60m is
the minimum level that PO should have and therefore should be retained.

6. Professional Indemnity

6.1 This policy was purchased to meet the Government Service Contracts
contractual requirements. The policy has a GBP10m limit and covers a breach of
professional duty by PO resulting in a third party loss. The policy covers Civil
liability, defence costs and expenses, libel and slander (committed by PO or any
person employed by PO). The policy has a GBP250k excess. QBE are the lead
insurer.

6.2 Our strategy, particularly in relation to our Fl products, and the increased risks
this brings to the organisation, means that we should consider purchasing
Professional Indemnity insurance for the whole organisation. The review is
underway and insurers have spent some time with PO assessing the exposures.

7. Cyber Liability

7.1 This insurance is purchased as a specific requirement for the DVLA and Border
Agency contracts and is a broad cover, extending to breach of privacy, extortion,
network security, as well as breach of data. This policy renews in April 2015

7.2 One of our key strategic risks relates to data protection and data integrity. The
Insurance review has identified that consideration should be given to purchasing
Cyber Liability across PO which would offer us a level of protection in the event
of a significant loss.

Quality

Comment / Areas for Discussion

Network
Transformation

Contracts signed, openings and current quality measures ahead of target, though model profitability KPI to be agreed via revised business
case which is now due for completion in September. Guided Leavers pilot underway with no significant negative stakeholder rea ction, with
continued roll out of next stages agreed at programme Steering Group. Key action for the programme is to define clearly, discuss and
agree the ‘cliff, aligning to business strategies being presented to Board in September

Crown
Transformation

The programme continues to deliver in line with targets across branch transformations, training, staff cost reductions, SSK rollout, mergers
and relocations - though P&L run rate £1M adverse at end of Q1 (due to income and business wide cost savings behind plan). Therefore
an over achievement in last 3 quarters is needed to achieve target. More focused income call to action required at Trading Board to
address Crown income shortfall. Customer satisfaction (queue times and transformed branches) both behind target but at P5 variance
from target improving. 16 of the 70 Franchise branches are at risk with the programme investigating options for alternative ways to
franchise or find further savings to cover the shortfall

Programme to produce a series of options, for October Transformation Committee, to achieve Crown break even run rate by March 2015
{including close alignment with Network Development)

Branch Support

Programme continuing, rather than pause or integrate into Business Transformation to allow early savings to be realised and improve
efficiency of existing operation. This will create a more stable platform for any TOM changes to be made. The programme is investigating
accelerating activity to bring forward benefits from 2015-16 into this year (potential additional £500K benefits). Specific questions within
Agent engagement index are proposed to measure Quality of the programme output.

Separation

Core Finance System implementation and cut over successfully achieved to plan.

Extension side letter due to be agreed at the next MSA Board on the 24" Sept and includes incentives to separation dates for the
remaining IT workstreams. The CSC contract supporting the separation of HR and Supply Chain (hosting and service elements) due to be
signed in late September.

IT
Transformation

Alignment between IT Transformation and Business Transformation programmes continues.
Revised business case produced but not yet submitted to Finance Committee, benefits and 2014-15 cost profile remain on track, though
there is a risk to the programme costs beyond 2014/15.

IT Enablers

Network Development has significant dependencies on Common Digital Platform and Branch Counter Refresh with appropriate ATOS and
Accenture resource working within the Network Development programme. As a result of pausing the POL SAP upgrade a risk has risen
regarding Fujitsu's willingness to continue supporting POL SAP on the existing infrastructure until March 2016 — discussions have started
with Fujitsu. Transformation Committee agreed alternative governance reporting for IT Enablers portfolio.

Business
Transformation

TOM recommendations discussed at ExCo in preparation for Post Office Board meeting on 25" September. A review of the impact of the
TOM on existing programmes to be undertaken prior to Board meeting. Programme co -ordinating all cost reduction activities (both
operational efficiency and existing cost reduction actions) and reporting to ExCo on weekly basis. An assessment of 2014/15 change plan
has been completed with recommendations being implemented (e.g. pausing certain projects and aligning others).

Benefits red as route to achieving savings not yet agreed.

Network
Development

Programme fully operational with focus on recommendations for September Post Office Board, a compelling commercial proposition to
inform the full programme business case and Ivy pilots (that are under development). A major risk for the programme is being able to

Post Office®

develop a commercially viable business case.

POST OFFICE LTD EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE

Health & Safety Report

1. Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to:

1 Provide an update on safety performance.
1.2 Outline risk reduction activities.

2. Current Situation

2.1 The majority of accidents fall into three main categories lifting and handling,
stepping and striking and outdoor falls. These are higher frequency events with, in
the majority, relatively low severity. The lower frequency types of incident can carry
the potential for very high impact, for example, assaults and road traffic collisions.

2.2 All safety KPIs for 2013/14 were met or exceeded for the fifth year running.
Performance during the first four months of 2014/15 indicates that at this early stage
of the year and despite the slight adverse performance in absence accidents and
days lost there is no current cause for concern that further reductions by year end
are achievable and in line with the 5% year on year reduction target.

2.3 Personal injury compensation claims are falling in line with the reduction in
accidents that result in sick absence. Comparison with a similar retail
organisation indicates that the Post Office claim rate is significantly lower in
both public and employer's liability and of those claims the ‘denial’ or ‘defence’
rate is significantly higher.

2.4 The number of days lost due to accidents is marginally adverse against target
however it is anticipated that the year on year reduction target of 5% will be
achieved. (Table 2 below refers)

2.5 The total number of road traffic collisions (RTCs) for the first 4 months is up 19
on last year. While this is of concern it is believed that there continues to be a
more robust approach to the reporting of incidents, irrespective of severity, and
what appears to be an increase in minor damage incidents e.g. broken mirrors
and minor scrapes The number of incidents where the Post Office driver is ‘at
fault’ is also up compared to last year. (Table 3 refers) Road risk reduction
opportunities continue to be the subject of analysis at the Road Risk Forum with
a view to identifying improvement activities in addition to those already in place.
(3.1 below) Reversing incidents are currently a cause for concern and will be
the subject of additional attention. Injuries as a result of road traffic collisions
are extremely infrequent. Road traffic collisions account for less than 3% of the
overall number of injury accidents, however they have the potential for high
impact in terms of injury and loss. Currently the majority of incidents involve low
speed — less than 25mph.

Robberies on Post Office Cash and Valuables in Transit (CViT) crews are down
one on last year from 14 to 13 for the past 4 months. Physical injuries during
robberies, of which there have been 4, 2 more than last year for the same
period, remain relatively minor in severity. The level of use of firearms remains
consistent with last year with 2 of the 13 robberies enabled by the presence
and/or threat of use of fire arms and on no occasions were the firearms
discharged. Support for those affected by robberies is provided by trained
trauma supporters and professional support resources available through the
occupational health service provision. Risk reduction activities are identified at
3.2. (Appendix 1 — Significant Incidents refers)

Robberies and attempted robberies on the Post Office network, for the first four
months, are the same as last year — 29 — just over 62% were successful.
Injuries sustained during robberies are down from 5 to 1. Robberies take place
predominantly at sub post offices leaving Crown branches largely unaffected.
Supporting activities have been introduced to continue to mitigate this risk and
are identified at 3.2. (Appendix 1 — Significant Incidents refers).

3. Activities

3.1

3.2

.
.
.
.

Road Risk

Current activities to mitigate road risk are:

Road risk forum in place to scope and develop road risk reduction initiatives
and activities with guidance from insurer's risk management division.

Review of policy and guidance for non-operational drivers e.g. business car
drivers to ensure transparent reporting of accidents and driving behaviours
interventions

Analysis and deployment of interventions for reversing incidents to mitigate the
increased incidence rates

Technical accident reduction interventions on new vehicles e.g. Reversing aids
to reduce accidents

Analysis and evaluation of data (e.g. risk profiles) to determine further accident
reduction interventions

Safe driver of the year award to encourage responsible driving

Weekly case conferences to ensure consistent approach to accident
investigation, follow up activity and sharing of best practice

Robbery/Burglary Risk

Current activities to mitigate robbery and burglary risk are:

Active liaison activities with the police and increased police support activity
Liaison with Met. Police on the increase in gun enabled robberies
Introduction of new deterrent technologies e.g. DNA taggant — a solution that
contains a unique identifier that is released automatically in the event of a
robbery, spraying those involved and enabling identification of the individuals
involved in the robberies

Significant reduction in opportunities for duress type robberies linked to the
introduction of single person vehicles

Increased security support visits to Post Offices in ‘hotspot’ areas

Increased use of crime alert communication techniques to Post Offices
Piloting new point of transfer arrangements to reduce exposure

Fogging technology

Safe time locks

Increased use of surveillance vehicles

e Athree month ‘Crime stopper’ campaign in the West Midlands is in place,
aimed at reducing cash in transit robberies

3.3 Health and Wellbeing

Current activities to enhance wellbeing
e Second phase of visits to all Post Office sites to offer and encourage the use of
health check equipment that provides a wide range of indicators on physical
wellbeing. First phase of programme delivered 3681 health checks (Crowns
2486, Admin. 553 and Supply Chain 662). The anonymised data will be used to
develop future health and wellbeing campaigns.
Health and wellbeing ‘Team Talk’ modules
Health and wellbeing poster themed campaigns
Online wellbeing monitoring tool to support health check initiative
Roll out of mental health awareness programme

3.4 Safety

The Post Office occupational health and safety management system (OHSMS)
is certified by external auditors to the standards required by British Standard
OHSAS 18001.

3.5 Asbestos Management

Transfer of the ownership of asbestos management following separation has
led to a programme of actions to ensure that up-to-date surveys are available,
defined responsibilities post-split are clear and that an asbestos management
‘action plan’ is in place to ensure that these issues can be managed effectively
and in line with legislation. Legal Services have been engaged to advise on
responsibilities, particularly in relation to the agency network, and to ensure
arrangements for on-going management of asbestos are robust and risks
mitigated.

4. Residual Risks

44 Driving activities have the potential for high impact/loss and therefore remain as
a significant residual risk. However, the actions identified in 3.1 above are
aimed at mitigating that risk and improving performance.

5. Recommendation
The ExCo is asked to:
5.1 Note the overall safety performance

5.2 Note the risk reduction activities.
5.3 Note the residual risks
