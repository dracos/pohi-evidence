SUBJECT: - Investigation Ref: - POLTD/0708/0249- WEST BYFLEET/SEEMA MISRA

Following the financial investigation into this case, the matter proceeded to a full confiscation hearing, which was
subsequently heard at Guildford Crown Court on Friday 8" July 2041.

It was apparent from documents supplied by the defence Barrister on the day of the hearing that the defendant
had numerous debts and was being pursed by a number of debt recovery agencies. We were also informed that
the property owned by the defendant was in the process of being re-possessed. However, no documents were
produced to support this claim. It was also claimed that the value of the property was as low as £170,000 and
that the other debts would account for any available equity. The defence offered a nominal order of £1.00 due to
having no available assets.

Having examined the documents provided by the defence, I concluded that they did not take precedence over our
claim and that some of the claims would need clarification if they were to be accepted by us. Given this position, it
was put to the defence that we would be seeking an order for £40,000.00 to which the defence agreed.

As a result, a confiscation order was made by the court for £40,000.00 with the whole amount to be paid as
compensation to Post Office Ltd. The defendant was given 6 months to pay with a default sentence of 15 months
imprisonment.

Further enquiries suggest that there is a considerable higher value on the property of in excess of £200,000.00.
Should this prove to be the case, then we will be at liberty to revisit the matter at court and ask for a higher
amount of confiscation. I will continue to monitor the situation in the meantime.
